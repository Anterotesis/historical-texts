         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But since the knowledge of my own weakness forbids

all he has done (in one of his greatest Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies)

            <p>For I dare leave it to any impartial Reader of this Age to
judge, whether any of his Descriptions of those Hero's, whose

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THough this History be so excellent in it self,
both as to its Method and Original Style, that
it needs no Preface to recommend it, yet such
is the invincible power of Custom, that a loose
Sheet must be cast away to usher it among the
people; and I cannot be so stubborn to disoblige them in so
trivial a matter: and though I know it is no purpose to say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing of my self, since all I can say will not stop the least
censure; yet for others satisfaction I will speak something of
my Author, and this Book, as 'tis his.</p>
            <p>He was, though Native of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a Roman Citizen,
and for his exquisite parts and Learning so much respected in
his time, that he was successively Advocate to two Emperours
of <hi>Rome;</hi> an Employment which gave him the opportunity
of having at his command the prime Records of the Empire,
which it is possible first put him upon composing this History:
for by several hints in these Books of his we find the use he
made thereof, and especially of the private Memoirs of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus
Caesar,</hi> written with his own hand, which he tells us he
had seen, and whereby possibly he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as enabled so exactly to
discourse of those intricate causes of disgust between young
<hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony,</hi> which he does in his Civil Wars, and
which possibly he had been much more large upon in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> had not that among others unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
been lost.</p>
            <p>For he began his History from the Infancy of the Roman-State
(his first Book treating of their Affairs under their
Kings) and so continued it, not by hudling all their Actions
together according to an exact series of time, but by compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a particular Book of every great and renowned War in
any Province or Country, without intermingling it with the
Affairs of any other Country farther than the necessity of the
Story required, till at length he concluded with the Battel of
<pb facs="tcp:65196:5"/>
               <hi>Actium,</hi> and Conquest of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was the last Province
reduced under the Roman Power, and with which the whole
Empire became entirely settled in peace under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Caesar Augustus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And certainly all the mighty Actions of so great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a people as those of <hi>Rome,</hi> compiled by so excellent an
Author, must needs have been a Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>k worthy of the World:
but whether it were the pleasure of Fate to make us sensible
that all things sublunary are subject to decay, or (as the French

the Roman Pride, Ava<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of all their prodigious Undertakings should be transmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Posterity, this fell under fate of most Roman Histories,
and of thirty two Books written by <hi>Appian,</hi> nineteen have
been eaten up by devouring time, and thirteen only preserved
to our days, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Punick, Syrian, Parthian, Mithridatick,

Copy with the <hi>Annot. Var.</hi> there are several fragmenrs of other
Wars managed by the Roman People, but so utterly imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
that the translating of them would have given little or
no satisfaction to the Reader.</p>
            <p>I have but one thing more to add, that is, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our misfortunes in being deprived of so great a part of this
noble History, we may take occasion to admire the excellent
method and contrivance of <hi>Appian,</hi> his composure being
such, that though so many of his Books are lost, yet the want
of them renders not those left imperfect (as <hi>Livy,</hi> or other
Historians are by so much as is left of them) but by taking
the whole Affairs of every Country from the first dealings the
Romans had with them, till such time as they were reduced
to a Roman Province, he makes every Book independant, and
become a perfect History, and withal the Reader not being
amused, nor his memory confounded by running from one
Action to another, nor the Affairs of one People or Nation to
another, according to the series of time is not exposed to the
hazard of forge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

that breaks of in the middle, to give way to others, as we see
in many other Histories, but may go on with all Delight
imaginable every thing here treated of, being perfect and
entire in it self.</p>

OF THE
AUTHOR.</head>
            <p>DEsigning to write a History of the Roman Wars, I judged it
convenient to begin it with the Bounds of their Empire. In
the first place, the greatest part of those Nations inhabiting
the Coasts of the British Ocean pay them obedience; from
thence entring into the Mediterranean Sea by the Straits of
<hi>Gibraltar,</hi> which way soever you cast your eyes, all that you
behold of Isles or Ports or Lands, is subject to their Dominion. The first peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
found on the right hand Coast of that Sea are the Mauritanians or Moors,
and after them several other Africans, as far as <hi>Carthage,</hi> and up in the
main Land are the <hi>Nomades,</hi> whom the Latines call Numidians, as they call the
Country <hi>Numidia.</hi> Continuing onwards on the Sea Coast by the Lybians, as
far as the<note n="*" place="margin">Or Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands.</note> 
               <hi>Syrtes</hi> on the Coast of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> and <hi>Cyrene</hi> it self. Next them suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

Romans. Who moreover having landed their Forces in <hi>Britany,</hi> which is an
Island so great, that it seems another Continent, they have conquered the better
half, slighting the remainder as not worth their pains: nor indeed does that
part they possess yield them any great advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65196:6"/>
Though they have now subdued so many People and Nations, yet were they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
five hundred years before they could make themselves Masters of all <hi>Italy.</hi>
Two hundred and fifty years they lived under their Kings, till having expelled
them with a solemn Oath, never to admit them again, their Common-wealth
was governed by the worthiest Citizens, and by Magistrates which they yearly
changed, insomuch, that within two hundred years after the first five hundred
it was by continual Victories, and the assistance of Strangers, who from all parts
sought their alliance, increased to such a height, that in those times the Romans
became Conquerors of a great number of Provinces.</p>
            <p>After which <hi>Caesar</hi> having made himself the most powerful of the Age he
lived in, was so near usurping the Sovereignty, that he left the Romans only the
shaddow and name of a Common-wealth, whilst he in effect was become absolute
Master of it; insomuch, that from his time even to this all that great Empire
has payed obedience to one single person, whom, to avoid the violation of their
Oath (occording to my opinion) they stiled nothing but<note n="*" place="margin">Commander in chief, or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Army.</note> Emperour; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the name it self seems much more genuine, as being likewise common to
those who commanded an Army for a time: and yet they are indeed Kings in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
'Tis now two hundred years since the first of those Emperours unto our
time, during which, a long and constant peace having secured their Dominion,
the City is become both beautiful and rich. For the first mightily added to the
Provinces, and restrained within bounds of duty those which had a mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt.
And in short, very prudently chose rather to content themselves with
those rich Countries on the Sea Coast, and with the well ordering of them, than
to stretch their Empire <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> over poor and barbarous Nations from
whom they could reap no advantage: I my self have seen at <hi>Rome</hi> Ambassadors
who have come expresly to submit themselves and their Country to the Roman
Empire, whom the Emperour would not accept of, because they could bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to his Coffers; for they give Kings to a multitude of Nations, whose Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
they themselves despise, and are at the expence to defend sundry Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
esteeming it a great dishonour to desert those whom they have once taken
into their protection.</p>
            <p>They have always been careful to maintain on their Frontiers mighty Armies,
as Guards to this vast Empire, which both by Sea and Land they have with such
labour and diligence maintained, as if it had been but some little Province:
nor was ever any Dominion of so great extent, and so long duration together.
For if we consider <hi>Greece</hi> since the Reign of <hi>Darius,</hi> which was the time of
its beginning of Glory, until <hi>Philip</hi> the Son of <hi>Amyntas</hi> adding to him the
Athenians, Lacedemonians and Thebans, there would yet be no comparison:
for the Greeks rather made War about the preheminence of their Cities, than
to enlarge their Territory; and the noblest of their Actions was but the Defence
of their Liberty against foreign Princes: for when any of them designed to pass
into <hi>Sicily,</hi> in order to any Conquest, they still came off with dishonour; or
if at any time in a hostile manner they entred <hi>Asia,</hi> they were forced to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
without doing any memorable Action. In short, the Grecian Prowess, as
ambitious as it was, never conquered any thing out of <hi>Greece</hi> which it any long
time enjoyed, being contented with preserving the Liberty of that Country, and
the reputation of an invincible valour; but after the time of <hi>Philip</hi> the Son of
<hi>Amyntas,</hi> and his Son <hi>Alexander,</hi> their Glory seems to me very much dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished:
nor had the Empire, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nded by them in <hi>Asia</hi> any thing to equal that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
by the Romans in <hi>Europe,</hi> considering the weakness and effeminacy of
<pb facs="tcp:65196:7"/>
the Asiaticks, as may be seen in the progress of this History. For the Romans
fought but few Battels to subdue all those Provinces they possessed, though they
were defended by Macedonians: but <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> were gained with
mighty labour. Besides, those three great Empires of the Assyrians, Medes
and Persians did not (put them altogether) continue nine hundred years, as
the Roman Power has done, which subsists to this instant, and yet the extent of
those three Empires was less by one half than that of the Romans, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
the Bounds of one with the other; for the Roman Empire reached from the
Western Ocean, as far as Mount <hi>Caucasus,</hi> the <hi>Euphrates;</hi> and to the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians
that are above <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Arabia:</hi> and in short, even to the Oriental
Sea, so that the Ocean were its bounds both Eastward and Westward, whilst all
the Mediterranean and those Isles it embraces, and even<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>England,</hi> not known in the Authors days, but by the name of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi> the name of <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought in by the Angles, a People in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> called in by the Britains to assist them in their War with the Picts, a People that then possessed that part of the Island call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then <hi>Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> now <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>(Britain)</hi> in the
Northern Ocean submitted to its Dominion. Whereas the Medes and Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in those times when they were most powerful at Sea, never had more than
the Gulph of <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> with the Island of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and some small matter
on the Coasts of the Ionian Sea, besides the Persian Gulf which is of no great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
As to the Affairs of the Macedonians before the Reign of <hi>Philip</hi> the
Son of <hi>Amyntas,</hi> they were but in a bad condition, having no sure Foundation.
True it is, that <hi>Philip</hi> was very happy in all he undertook, but he never waged
War out of <hi>Greece,</hi> or the Neighbouring Provinces. At last under <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
that Kingdom was raised to a prodigious and an incomparable height of
Greatness, as well for its extent, and the number of its people, as for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious
felicity of itsVictories; yet was it only like a flash of Lightning, if
we consider its short continuance, Not but that after it was divided into several
<note n="*" place="margin">Lieutenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerencies.</note> 
               <hi>Satrapies,</hi> every Province did for a long time afterwards maintain and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
its primitive splendor. For the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> only kept in pay two
hundred thousand Foot-men, forty thousand Horsemen, three hundred Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
trained to the War, two thousand Chariots armed with Scythes, with
Arms in store for three hundred thousand Men; and besides all these Land-Forces,
had in constant readiness two thousand S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>allops, or small Vessels, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hundred Gallies, with all their Furniture, eight hundred tall Ships rigged,
and splendidly fitted with all Naval Provisions, and richly gilded both in
Poop and Prow, on which they were wont to go to War, that they might appear
with the greater pomp. As for Money, they had continually in the Treasury
seven hundred and forty thousand Egyptian Talents of Silver, as appears by the
Registers wherein these things are recorded, which are producible to this day,
and particularly those left by <hi>Alexander</hi>'s immediate Successor to the Kingdom
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who of all the Kings was the most exact in his Accounts of his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
most splendid in his Expences, and most magnificent in his Buildings,
Most certain it is, there were some other <hi>Satrapies</hi> not much inferiour to this,
but they all fell to ruine by the Civil Dissentions of the succeeding Princes,
than which no more dangerous Plague can infect a great Estate. But the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire, because admirable both in its greatness and prosperity, by reason of
that long continuance, the product of its Senates prudent deliberations, though
the raising of this Estate required an extraordinary, vigour, and Spirits capable
of undergoing incredible labour and overcoming ten thousand difficulties; for
success never made them proud nor presumptuous, till they saw themselves firmly
setteled: and on the other side, adversity never dismayed them; for not the loss of
twenty, nay forty, no, nor fifty thousand Men in one single Battel, not the
hazard of an absolute ruine by Plague, Famine, or Sedition, euer made them
abate of their Courage; but at last having baffled all imaginable dangers for
seven hundred years together, and triumph'd over all those difficulties dayly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb facs="tcp:65196:7"/>
them, they raised their Empire to that height of Glory and Greatness;
and at present reap the Fruits of both their good Fortune and Prudence.</p>
            <p>Many Authors as well Greek as Latine have wrote of all these things, and
indeed the Subject is greater than that of the Macedonian Affairs, though they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere in their season possibly more considerable. But for my part, after having
well considered the Roman Virtue, that I might make the more contemplative
comparison of it with that of other Nations, I have given freedom to my
thoughts to wander from one place to another, from <hi>Carthage</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> from
thence to <hi>Sicily</hi> or <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and fancied either an Embassie, or a Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to succour the oppressed, and thence like a perfect Vagabond (that had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else to do) returning either to <hi>Carthage</hi> or <hi>Sicily,</hi> I have collected
all things necessary to compose this History: I informed my self how often
the Romans sent Ambassadors or Armies into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and of every minute
Action they performed there, till they reduced it under that obedience it now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges.
I enquired into all Treaties of Peace, or Overtures between one or
t'other that had been transacted between the Carthaginians and Roman People,
what Wrongs one had done to the other, and what Losses and Overthrows each
had received till such time as <hi>Carthage</hi> was demolished, and <hi>Africa</hi> was made a
Roman Province; and at last how <hi>Carthage</hi> being rebuilt, <hi>Africa</hi> came into
the state we now find it: I have followed the same course through all the other
Provinces, led by a curiosity to understand all that the Romans had done of great
and glorious, to know the sloth or industry of every Nation, the Virtue and
Fortune of this victorious People. And in short, all things worthy recording:
and imagining it would be no unpleasant thing to the world to know the Roman
History, in this manner I laid my design to write the particular Actions of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Province by themselves, omitting what in those times was done elsewhere,
and referring it to its proper place and order. I looked upon it likewise as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
to set down throughout the whole the time when every thing passed,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> sufficient to observe it in Affairs of most Importance.</p>
            <p>Let me add, that heretofore the Romans had but one name, like other men,
in process of time they added another; and it is not long since that some of them
took a third, the better to make themselves be known, either by some bodily mark,
or some advantageous endowment of mind; so some Greeks likewise to their
names added Sirnames. Wherefore I shall sometime make use of all their
Names, especially when I am treating of Illustrious Personages, to the intent
they may be the better known; but Ishall call many, as well of the one as the
other, by those names most agreeable to the matter in hand.</p>
            <p>For the Order and Method of this History, 'tis taken from the time in which
these Wars were begun and ended (notwithstanding there were divers others
interfer'd, which are omitted to avoid confusion.) Wherefore the several
Books shall take their Titles from the matter, as the <hi>Punik, Syrian, Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
Mithridatick, Iberian,</hi> and <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Domestick Seditions, and Civil Wars, we shall treat of them
according to the time in which the Authors of them lived, as that of <hi>Marius</hi>
and <hi>Sylla;</hi> of <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caesar;</hi> of <hi>Anthony</hi> and the other <hi>Caesar,</hi> sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<hi>Augustus,</hi> against the Murderers of the first <hi>Caesar.</hi> And lastly, the
War which the Conquerours made one against another, which is the last Civil
War, and during which, <hi>Egypt</hi> fell into the Power of the Romans. Thus the
<pb facs="tcp:65196:8"/>
Affairs with strange Nations, shall be divided by each Book, and the Civil
Wars by the Chiefs of the Parties.</p>
            <p>But who am I that write all these things? Many persons know already, and
I my self have declared it, but to declare it yet more publickly. I was born in

               <p>THe Phenicians built <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> fifty years before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
the sack of <hi>Troy.</hi> It was Founded by <hi>Xorus,</hi> and <hi>Carche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
or as the Romans, and indeed the Carthaginians
themselves, will have it, by a Tyrian Lady called <hi>Dido,</hi>
who (her Husband being privily murdered by <hi>Pygma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi>
Tyrant of <hi>Tyre,</hi> which was revealed to her in a
Dream) conveyed aboard all the Treasure she could, and shipping her self
with some Tyrians that fled from the Tyranny, came to <hi>Lybia,</hi> to that
place where now <hi>Carthage</hi> stands; and upon the people of that Countries
refusal to receive them they demanded for their Habitation only so much
Land as they could compass with an Oxe-hide. This proposition seemed
ridiculous to the Africans, and they thought it a shame to refuse Strangers
a thing of so small consequence; besides they could not imagine how any
Habitation could be built in so small a patch of ground, and therefore that
they might have the pleasure to discover the Phenicians subtilty, they
granted their request. Whereupon the Tyrians taking an Oxe-hide, cut it
round about, and made so fine a Thong, that they therewith encompassed
the place where they afterwards built the Citadel of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which
from thence was called<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Byrsa</hi> in Greek signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a Hide.</note> 
                  <hi>Byrsa.</hi> Soon after by little and little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
their limits, and becoming stronger then their Neighbours, as
they were much more cunning, they caused Ships to be built to
traffick on the Sea after the manner of the Phenicians, by which means
they built a City adjoyning to their Citadel. Their power thus
encreasing, they became Masters of <hi>Lybia,</hi> and the circumadjacent
Sea; and at last making War upon <hi>Sicily, Sardinia,</hi> and all the Islands
of that Sea, and even in <hi>Spain</hi> in self, they sent thither Colonies, till
at length from so small a beginning, they formed an Estate compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in Power to that of the Greeks, and in Riches to that of the
Persians.</p>
               <p>But about seven hundred years after the Foundation of <hi>Carthage,</hi> the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
Romans won <hi>Sicily</hi> from the Carthaginians, and after that <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and at
length in the second Punick War, <hi>Spain</hi> it self. After which these Nations
being in continual War, the Carthaginians under the command of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
wasted <hi>Italy</hi> for sixteen years together, till such time as the Romans
commanded by <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> the Elder, deprived them of their power,
taking from them their Ships, and Elephants, and forcing them to pay Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute;
whereupon a second Peace was concluded between these two People.
This lasted fifty years, after which began the third and last Punick
War, in which the young <hi>Scipio</hi> being General of the Romans, <hi>Carthage</hi>
was utterly ruined, and strict prohibition made of Rebuilding it. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65196:10"/>
the Romans founded another Town in a place near adjacent, which
they made choice of for the greater conveniency of keeping the Africans
in subjection. Now because in our History of <hi>Sicily,</hi> we have already set
down all the memorable acts of the Carthaginians there, and in that of
<hi>Spain,</hi> what passed in that Country, as likewise in that of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> all the
actions of that Captain in <hi>Italy,</hi> we have resolved in this Book to write
only what was done in <hi>Lybia,</hi>

that of <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When therefore the War of <hi>Sicily</hi> was ended, the Romans armed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
three hundred and fifty Ships, with which they made a descent into <hi>Lybia;</hi>
where after having reduced some Cities under their obedien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, they le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Attilius Regulus</hi> to command the Army. This General gained the Romans
two hundred Cities more, which surrendred to him, being weary of the
Government of <hi>Carthage;</hi> and pressing forward his Conquests, he spoiled
their Territories, even to their very Gates. After all these losses, which the
Carthaginians believed happen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed to them only for want of good Generals,
they demanded one from the Lacedemonians, who sent to them <hi>Xantippus.
Attilius</hi> was now encamped near the Fens of <hi>Lybia,</hi> from whence upon
Intelligence of this Captain's arrival, he advanced towards the Enemy; but
having taken his march along the Edge of the Marshes, and in the greatest
heats of Summer, his Souldiers were grievously incommoded by the weight
of their Arms, by thirst, heat, labour, and the darts thrown on them,
from the Mountains; yet though they marched in this condition all the
day, coming towards the Evening to a River, which now only separated
the two Armies; he forthwith made his Men pass over, believing it would
strike a terrour into <hi>Xantippus</hi> his Army. The Lacedemonian on the
other side, judging it would be no hard matter to overcome people harassed
in that manner, besides that he had the night to favour him, presently
drew up his Army in order and advanced to charge <hi>Attilius.</hi> In which he
was not deceived, for of thirty thousand Men that composed the Roman
Army, a few only saved themselves in the City of <hi>Aspides,</hi> all the rest were
slain or taken Prisoners, and the General himself fell into the Enemies hand.
Yet this advantage obstructed not the Carthaginians, tyred with the
War, from sending Ambassadors to <hi>Rome</hi> to demand Peace, and <hi>Attilius</hi>
himself went upon Parol, to return himself a Prisoner if he obtained it not.
And yet this Captain when he came to confer with the prime Men of
<hi>Rome,</hi> was so far from inclining them to Peace, that he perswaded them to
continue the War; and without doing ought else returned to <hi>Carthage,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to suffer the utmost of their torments, and indeed the Carthaginians
shut him up in a Cask driven full of sharp Nails, where he ended his Life
most miserably. However, this good success was the cause of <hi>Xantippus</hi>
his death, for the Carthaginians fearing lest all the honour of the Victory
would be attributed to the Lacedemonians, feigned a gratification of their
General, making him magnificent Presents, and sending him back in Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
of their own, but with orders to the Commanders of them, that as
soon as they came into the open Sea, they should throw <hi>Xantippus</hi> and the
Lacedemonians over-board; so unhappy a recompence did this valiant Man
receive for so brave an Action. And this is all that was done considerable
in the first Punick Wars till such time as the Carthaginians quitted to the
Romans all their Rights in <hi>Sicily;</hi> Now we have in our Sicilian History set
down in what manner this Treaty was made, therefore shall say no more
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65196:10"/>
here. It will be sufficient to understand that by this means Peace was
concluded between the People of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards the Africans who were subject to the Carthaginians and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
assisted them against <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the <hi>Celtes</hi> who served under their pay
in that War, complaining that the promises made them had not been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
declared War against them, which obliged those of <hi>Carthage</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
aid from the Romans as their friends, from whom notwithstanding
they could obtain no more, save a permission to levy Souldiers in <hi>Italy</hi> at
their own Charge: for and indeed by the Articles of the Treaty they could
not require so much as that favour; how be it the Romans sent deputyes
into <hi>Africa</hi> to determine the difference, and make Peace between these
people. But the Africans would by no means hearken to it, offering rather
to submit themselves to their government if they desired it, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they would not accept: this was the reason that made the Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
fit out so powerful a Fleet to revenge themselves on these Revolters,
that the Sea being no longer left open to the Lybians; by which they
might fetch in Provisions, and the land being left untill'd by reason of the
Wars, they were reduced to such great scarcity, as inforced them to return
under the Carthaginians obedience.</p>
               <p>This mighty Fleet not only pillaged the Lybians but even all they met <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
with, and the Romans themselves, whom they threw over-board after they
had rifled them, that it might not come to be known at <hi>Rome,</hi> and indeed
it was a long time ere these crimes were discovered, and when they were,
the Carthaginians seemed very averse to the giving satisfaction, till such
time that War being by the Romans declared against them they quitted
<hi>Sardinia</hi> in reparation of this injury. And this Article was added to the
first treaty of Peace. Sometime after the Carthaginians sent an Army into
<hi>Spain</hi> to reduce it under their obedience, and because they assailed those
People separately, they had already well advanced their Conquests: When
the Saguntines had recourse to the Romans for aid: Hereupon the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians
made a second Treaty, by which they were bound not to Act any
Hostilities beyond the River <hi>Iberus,</hi> but this Treaty was soon broken, for
<hi>Hannibal</hi> past that River, and leaving the Forces in <hi>Spain</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of other Captains came thundring into <hi>Italy</hi> with a Mighty Army.
The Romans had at this time in <hi>Spain, Publius Scipio</hi> and his brother
<hi>Cneus Cornelius,</hi> who after having gained sundry Victories, were slain by
the Enemy. Those who succeeded them had no better success, until <hi>Scipio</hi>
the Son of that <hi>Publius</hi> who was kill'd in <hi>Spain</hi> being commanded thither
with an Army, all the world looked upon him as a man sent by the Order
of Heaven, and guided by a Divine Spirit, so great and glorious were his
Actions. At last having gain'd much Honour and Renown, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
up the Army into their hands whom the Senate had appointed to
succeed him.</p>
               <p>Being returned to <hi>Rome</hi> he demanded Commission to pass into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/>
                  <hi>Africa</hi> with an Army, promising himself both to oblige <hi>Hannibal</hi> to quit
<hi>Italy,</hi> and to force reason from the Carthaginians in their own Country.
Many who had the highest charges in the Commonwealth disliked the
project, alleging there was little appearance of doing any good by sending
an Army into <hi>Africa,</hi> and quitting <hi>Italy,</hi> already by the Wars reduced al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
to extremity, whilst <hi>Hannibal</hi> raged with Fire and Sword, and <hi>Hanno</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65196:11"/>
was coming to fall on them with great multitudes of Ligurians and Celtes,
But the opposite party argued that it might well be believed that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians
who attempted not the Conquest of <hi>Italy,</hi> but because they
feared nothing at Home, would soon recal <hi>Hannibal</hi> when they saw War
at their own Doors, this opinion prevailed, but upon condition that <hi>Scipio</hi>
should make no levies in <hi>Italy</hi> so long as <hi>Hannibal</hi> was in Arms, but if any
Volunteers presented themselves he might make use of them as likewise of
the Army of <hi>Sicily;</hi> they likewise permitted him to take for his passage
ten of their Gallies ready fitted, with all those that he could find in <hi>Sicily,</hi>
yet without furnishing him with any Mony, but what himself could raise
among his private friends, so mean opinion had they of this enterprise
which afterwards proved of such mighty importance. But <hi>Scipio</hi> who
seem'd carried to <hi>Carthage</hi> by some Divine Power, transported him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into <hi>Sicily</hi> with only about seven thousand Horse and Foot, out of all
which he chose three hundred of the most strong and comely youth for a
guard to his Person; he would not arrive them in <hi>Italy,</hi> but as soon as he
arrived in <hi>Sicily</hi> he commanded a like number of the richest of the Island
to appear at a certain place with the fairest Arms and best Horses they
could procure; And as soon as they were come gave them leave to put
other Persons in their places, which being accepted by the Sicilians he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to them his three hundred young men commanding them, to give
them their Arms and their Horses, which they willingly consented to,
thus, instead of three hundred Sicilians, <hi>Scipio</hi> mounted and armed his
three hundred Italians, who could not but give him thanks for such
a favor and indeed did afterwards serve him Excellently well in many

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> As soon as the Carthaginians understood these things they gave
Commission to <hi>Asdrubal</hi> the son of <hi>Gisco</hi> to assemble Elephants and sent to
<hi>Mago</hi> who was then raising Forces in <hi>Liguria,</hi> six thousand Foot,
eight hundred Horse and seven Elephants with Orders forthwith
to enter<note n="*" place="margin">Tuscany.</note> 
                  <hi>Hetruria</hi> with all the force he could make, hoping to
oblige <hi>Scipio</hi> to quit his design on <hi>Lybia. Mago</hi> was not over-quick,
in the Execution of these Orders, whether it were that he could not
joyn with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who was far distant, or that he foresaw a troublesome
event of the Enterprise. <hi>Asdrubal</hi> upon his return from the Chase of the
Elephants, levies upon the Lands of the Carthaginians and Lybians, six
thousand Foot and eight hundred Horse, he buys likewise five thousand
slaves for the Gallies, and the Numidians furnished him with two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horse, besides some Foreign Mercenary Troops, so that having
assembled an Army composed of sundry Nations, he brought them
about two hundred Furlongs from the City and there exercised and
trained them.</p>

were separate, among whom <hi>Syphax</hi> held the first degree. <hi>Massanissa</hi> Son
to the King of the Massesulians a Warlike People, was likewise very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable,
and was withal so comely of person and active of mind that
<hi>Asdrubal</hi> the son of <hi>Gisco</hi> one of the principal men of <hi>Carthage</hi> desired him
for his son in law though he were a <hi>Numidian.</hi> As soon as the Marriage
was agreed upon, that young Prince went to make War in <hi>Spain;</hi> but
<hi>Syphax</hi> who was in love with the Lady, mad that she was engaged to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with an Army invades the Carthaginians Lands, and promises <hi>Scipio</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:65196:11"/>
(who came out of <hi>Spain</hi> to confer with him) that if he would assault
<hi>Carthage</hi> he would joyn Arms with him; which was the reason that the
Carthaginians, who knew well of what importance <hi>Syphax</hi> would be to
them in this War, gave him <hi>Masanissa's</hi> Mistress in Marriage without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his or <hi>Asdrubals</hi> own knowledg; for they were both together in <hi>Spain.</hi>
That young Prince receiving advice of the affront done him, so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
it, that to revenge himself he entered into a secret alliance with
<hi>Scipio,</hi> which yet could not be kept so private but it came to <hi>Asdrubals</hi>
knowledge, who though he were much troubled at the injury done to this
Lover and his Mistress, yet he believed he was bound to prefer the publick
good to his private resentment, and therefore to make away <hi>Masanissa.</hi>
To which end, when this Prince was upon return from <hi>Spain</hi> to take pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of his Fathers Kingdom, lately dead, he gave him some Horse to
accompany him, with Orders to destroy him, in what manner soever it
were; but the King suspecting their design, withdrew himself privily out
of their hands, and went to seise upon his Fathers Kingdom, which after
he had got possession of, he drew together a flying wing of people accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
to fight by night as well as by day and to charge and retreat in a
marvelous manner: for so they make war in <hi>Numidia,</hi> where the men easily
endure hunger, live on herbs instead of bread, and drink only water, and
where the Horses never eat Oats but feed only on Straw and Grass, and
drink but seldom. <hi>Masanissa</hi>'s Army was composed of twenty thousand
men of this temper, with whom he made strange incursions, spoiling the
Neighboring Provinces out of design to keep his men in Exercise. These
preparations made both the Carthaginians and <hi>Syphax,</hi> who had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices
in the affront put upon the young Prince, believe they were made
only to serve against them, wherefore they resolved to prevent him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
account that after they had defeated him, they would go meet the
Romans. They had a far greater Army then he, &amp; carried along with them
great quantities of Baggage and Waggons, loaden not only with things
necessary but voluptuous, on the contrary <hi>Masanissa</hi> was in all labor
an Example to his Souldiers; Among all his Cavalry there was no loads
either of Provison or Baggage, so that having nothing to hinder them,
sometimes they made a retreat, sometimes they charged the Enemy, and
then again retired into places strong by Situation. If sometimes he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
himself pressed too hard upon, he gave order to his people to save
themselves as they best could, and in the mean time kept himself conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only with a few, till such time as all returning by day or by night,
they were again assembled at the place by him appointed for their Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz.
Nay sometimes it hapned, that he hid himself only with two
horsemen in a Cave, about which the enemy lay encamped, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being discovered. And it was indeed his principal care that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
should not know the place of his retreat, that they might never be
able to assail him, but alwaies be forced to stand upon their own defence,
As for provision he gave himself not much trouble, still furnishing himself
by nightly surprises and whether it were Village, Town or City, he
plundered all, dividing the Prey among his Companions. For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
many Numidians stocked to him, not for pay, for he had none establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
but for booty which was more worth then pay.</p>
               <p>Whilst, <hi>Masanissa</hi> thus made war against the Carthaginians, <hi>Scipio</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/>
had perfected his preparations in <hi>Sicily,</hi> so that having sacrificed to <hi>Iupiter</hi>
and <hi>Neptune,</hi> he set sayl for <hi>Affrica</hi> with two and fifty long Ships, four
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65196:12"/>
hundred Ships of burthen, and a great number of Barks and Shallops: his
forces were composed of Sixteen thousand foot and Six hundred horse, and
with them he brought great store of Arms and Engines of War. <hi>Syphax</hi>
and the Carthaginians having advice of his coming resolved to make a
dissembled peace with <hi>Masanissa,</hi> and to patch up things with him until
such time as they had defeated <hi>Scipio.</hi> But well he knew their design, and
that he might pay them in their own Coyn, (having first sent advice to
<hi>Scipio)</hi> he comes to find out <hi>Asdrubal</hi> with his whole body of horse as if
he had been indeed reconciled. It was near unto <hi>Utica</hi> that <hi>Asdrubal,
Syphax</hi> and <hi>Masanissa</hi> were incamped separately, and <hi>Scipio</hi> having been
driven by the winds on that Coast, was likewise encamped near unto <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal,</hi>
who had twenty thousand foot, seven thousand horse, and twenty
seven Elephants. Whether <hi>Syphax</hi> were afraid, or that he had a mind to
betray all parties, he feigned that his Neighbors had invaded his Kingdom,
and under pretence to go and defend it, left the others.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/>
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> in the mean while having reduced some Cities under his
obedience, sent daily out some of his people to skirmish, that he might
draw <hi>Asdrubal</hi> to a battel, which yet he despaired to do, when <hi>Masanissa</hi>
by night comes secretly to his Camp, where after some Civilities passed on
either side, he advises him to place the next morning five thousand men in
Ambush, about thirty furlongs from <hi>Utica,</hi> near the tower of <hi>Agathocles,</hi>
formerly Tyrant of <hi>Syracusa;</hi> And about break of day he perswades <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal,</hi>
to send <hi>Hanno</hi> who commanded the horse, to take a view of the
<hi>Roman</hi> forces and throw himself into <hi>Utica,</hi> lest the enemy lying so near,
those inhabitants should revolt, offering himself to follow and second him,
if <hi>Asdrubal</hi> thought it convenient. <hi>Hanno</hi> hereupon took the field with a
thousand chosen Carthaginian horse, and some Lybians, <hi>Masanissa</hi> with
his Numidians followed: But when they were on the right hand of the
Tower, <hi>Hanno</hi> with a few of his people having already taken the way
towards <hi>Utica,</hi> a part of those who lay in Ambush appeared, which gave
opportunity to <hi>Masanissa</hi> to advise him, whom <hi>Hanno</hi> had left to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> horse to charge, as if the Enemy had been but an
inconsiderable number, and he himself followed under pretence of second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him. The Africans hereupon advancing, the rest of the Ambush ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and now were these unfortunate people enclosed on all sides, and
as well by the Romans as by <hi>Masanissa</hi> himself cut all in pieces, save only
four hundred which were taken Prisoners. After this defeat he posts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Hanno,</hi> and coming up him as if he had been his friend, arrests him and
carries him prisoner into <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Camp, and afterwards exchanged him for
his Mother who was in <hi>Asdrubal</hi>'s hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> After that <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Masanissa</hi> were joyned together, they pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged
the whole Country, and delivered from bondage those Romans
which they found in Fetters, destined to toyl and slavery, and who had
been sent thither by <hi>Hannibal</hi> from <hi>Spain, Sicily</hi> and even from <hi>Italy</hi> it
self. Afterwards they laid Siege before a great City called <hi>Locha,</hi> where
they found great difficulties; yet at length it hapned that as they were
bringing the Ladders to the Walls, resolved to take it by Storm, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
by a Herauld demanded that they might have permission to march
out of the Town, with their Arms and Baggage; whereupon <hi>Scipio</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Retreat to be founded. But the Souldiers angred at the miseries
they had undergone in the siege, would not obey, but scaled the walls, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65196:12"/>
all they met with and sparing neither sex nor age; The General sent
away without ransom all that were saved, and as a punishment of their
disobedience, he took away all the plunder from the Souldiers, and caused
those Officers, were the cause of it, to cast Lots for their lives, in the sight
of the whole Army, of whom three only he condemned to death, to whom
fortune was not favorable.</p>
               <p>Being returned again to wast the Country, <hi>Asdrubal</hi> laid a plot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/>
to surprize him, and to effect it, gave Order to <hi>Mago</hi> who Commanded
his horse, to charge him in the Front, whilst he another way fell in upon the
Rear. The Romans finding themselves thus engaged in the midst of their
Enemies, divided their Army, likewise into two parts, and <hi>Scipio</hi> and
<hi>Masanissa</hi> commanding each their body, cut in pieces five thousand Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,
took eighteen hundred Prisoners and pursued the rest so close, that
many of them tumbled headlong down the steep Rocks.</p>
               <p>Some days after <hi>Scipio</hi> besieged <hi>Utica</hi> by Sea and by Land, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/>
having joyned two Gallies together, built Towers upon them, from whence
he cast into the City Darts and Stones. Thus he did some damage to the
inhabitants; but he received likewise by the loss of some ships. Mean
while in the Siege by land they raised great platforms near the walls on
which they planted batteries and with great<note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Greek</hi> calls them, scyths, and indeed they did call these sort of hooks scyths which they made use of in the same manner as they did the Rams, only the Rams beat the Walls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and the Scyths pull'd them outwards, and for the word ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier the Greek says, the hides and other cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, there is a like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription in the seventh Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the rampire. The inhabitants on the other side undermined the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siegers
works by passages under ground, tumbling them down as fast
as they raised them; they twined aside the hooks with Ropes, so that
they could take no effect; they opposed to the Rams great Timbers or
Booms which received the blow without endamaging the walls, and
when the wind blew towards the Engines they darted out fire-brands to
burn them. Insomuch that <hi>Scipio</hi> out of hopes to take the City by this
way of fighting, resolved to carry it by assault, when <hi>Syphax</hi> having intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of his design advances his Army, and encamps near <hi>Asdrubal.</hi>
He declares himself a friend to both parties; But it was only to gain so
much time, till those other Ships then building for the Carthaginians
were in a readiness, and the Souldiers raised in <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Liguria</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.
He would likewise have become a Mediator between the two
Estates and proposed a Treaty, the Conditions of which were, that
the Carthaginian Army should return out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Romans
depart out of <hi>Lybia</hi> and for the rest that <hi>Sicily, Sardinia</hi> and the
other Isles that had belonged to the Carthaginians, together with
<hi>Spain,</hi> should remain entire to the people of <hi>Rome</hi> making his protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that if either of the parties refused to consent to these propositions he
would joyn with the other; In the mean time he used his utmost endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to gain <hi>Masanissa,</hi> promising to secure to him the Kingdom of the
Massesuliens, and to give him in Marriage which of his three daughters he
desired. His agent that came to <hi>Masanissa</hi> with these offers brought store

Ligurian Souldiers arrived with those ships the Carthaginians had fitted
out, they resolved to fight. <hi>Syphax</hi> returned to the siege of <hi>Utica. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal</hi>
encamped near to <hi>Scipio,</hi> and the Carthaginian fleet came to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor

and so that the Romans being much fewer in number and separate the one
from the other, might not be able to sustain the power of their enemies.
<hi>Masanissa</hi> having advice of this design from some Numidians, went and
communicated it to <hi>Scipio,</hi> who without any delay (judging that if his
Army were thus divided they would not be strong enough to stand the
shock) the same night assembled the Council, and when he saw they lost
time without resolving any thing, he thus spoke to his Captains.</p>

the tumult was so great they could not hear the voices of them that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,

The Romans thronged in among these people whom they found in disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and ill Armed, setting all before them on fire, and putting all they
met with to the Sword; Their shouts, the sight of them, and their
fierceness, stroke terror into these miserable people, and the night and
the incertainty of the danger increased it, so that believing all their Camp
was absolutely taken, fearing to be involved in the general ruine they
thronged in crouds towards the plain, where they thought they might be
in more security, and every one taking his own way they fell into the
hands of the horsemen, who made a most dreadful slaughter, <hi>Syphax</hi>
heard this great noise in the night and saw the flames, but stirred not out
of his Camp, only sent some Troops of Horse to assist <hi>Asdrubal</hi> who falling
into <hi>Masanissa</hi>'s Ambush were all cut of; When at break of day <hi>Syphax</hi>
understood that <hi>Asdrubal</hi> was fled, that all his Army were either slain,
taken, or ran away, that his Camp with all his munition of war was in
the Romans possession, he deserted all, retiring farther up into the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
out of fear lest <hi>Scipio</hi> returning from the Chase of <hi>Asdrubal</hi> should
turn his Arms against him, leaving his Camp and all it's furniture as a
prey to <hi>Masanissa.</hi> Thus at one stroke in less then a night the Romans
took two Camps and routed two Armies beyond comparison greater than
theirs. The vanquishers lost about one hundred Souldiers, and the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
about thirty thousand, besides two thousand four hundred that

to <hi>Scipio</hi> upon his return from the Victory, as for the Elephants they
were all either wounded or killed, <hi>Scipio</hi> having gained in this battel great

that his Citizens had condemned him to death for his ill Conduct in this
War, and that they had made <hi>Hanno</hi> the Son of <hi>Bomilcar</hi> his Successor, he

Ships to the Port where <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Fleet lay, believing that before <hi>Scipio</hi> could
return he should easily defeat twenty Roman Gallies with his hundred
Ships. But <hi>Scipio</hi> having intelligence of his Design sent his Orders before
to block up the Ports mouth with Ships of burthen, which they ranged
before it at Anchor, in such manner that there were passages left for the
Roman Gallies to Sally out when they saw an advantage, and yet these
great Ships were fastned together by the Yard-arms, and served as a wall
against the enemies. The work was not quite finished at his arrival, but
he soon brought it to perfection. The Carthaginian Ships then coming to
assault the Romans were beaten off by flights of Arrows and Stones, as
well from those in the ships as on shore, and from the walls of the Port, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that most of them being battered and the Souldiers quite tyred
they retired in the Evening without doing any thing. As they made
their retreat the Roman Gallies sallied by the passages which we spoke of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and when they found they could execute nothing, they retreated into the
Port by the same passages. At length they brought to <hi>Scipio</hi> one of the
enemies ships, but not a man in her. After these encounters, it being now
winter, each party retired to their Garrisons.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/> The Romans caused provision to be brought for themselves by
Sea, but those of <hi>Utica</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> being in great necessity plundred
those which brought them, till a recruit of shipping being come to
<hi>Scipio</hi> he opposed the enemy in such manner that they not daring longer
to cruise as they were wont, those Cities were miserably afflicted with
famine. During this same winter <hi>Syphax</hi> not being far distant, <hi>Masanissa</hi>
desired of <hi>Scipio</hi> a third part of the Roman Army, which being arrived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Command of <hi>Lelius</hi> and joyned with that Kings Forces, they to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
pursued <hi>Syphax,</hi> who still retreated before them, till such time as
coming to the Banks of a certain River he was forced to fight. The Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians
according to their Custom cast at first charge showers of Darts at
each other, whilst the Romans covering themselves with their shields still
advanced forward. <hi>Syphax</hi> seeing <hi>Masanissa</hi> in the heat of the Battel,
transported with rage makes directly towards him, and <hi>Masanissa</hi> joyfully
runs to meet him: After they had generously fought as well on one side
as the other, at length <hi>Syphax</hi> party was routed, and as he was passing the
river to save himself his horse wounded by some accidental stroke, reared
and came backward with his Master into the water. Whereupon <hi>Masa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa</hi>
pressing in, took him and one of his sons prisoners, both which he sent
to <hi>Scipio.</hi> There were in this fight about two thousand men slain, on <hi>Syphax</hi>
his party; the <hi>Romans</hi> lost seventy five, and <hi>Masanissa</hi> three hundred,
there were likewise four thousand of <hi>Syphax</hi> men taken prisoners, of
which two thousand five hundred were Massesuliens that had deserted
<hi>Masanissa</hi> to take part with <hi>Syphax,</hi> these <hi>Masanissa</hi> demanded of
<hi>Lelius,</hi> and having obtained his request caused them to be all cut in
pieces.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XX"/> After this they entred into the Territories of the Massesuliens,
and of <hi>Syphax,</hi> to re-establish <hi>Masanissa</hi> in his Kingdom by receiving those
who submitted, and forcing those to obey who refused. The inhabitants
of <hi>Cirtha</hi> sent deputies unto them with Orders to offer them the Royal
Palace, and in particular there came others to <hi>Masanissa</hi> from <hi>Sophonisba</hi>
wife of the Prisoner King, to excuse her of that Marriage to which she
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65196:14"/>
had been forced. He easily accepted of her Excuses, but when he returned
back to <hi>Scipio,</hi> left her still at <hi>Cirtha,</hi> foreseeing what would happen. When
<hi>Syphax</hi> was brought to <hi>Scipio,</hi> he was ask't by him what evil Genius had
perverted his spirit, to the violation of his faith, and despising of those Gods
that were witnesses, by deceving the Romans in taking up arms against
them, and following the part of the Carthaginians their common enemy,
after having intreated him as a friend to come into <hi>Africa.</hi> To which he
answered, <hi>It was</hi> Sophonisba <hi>the daughter of</hi> Asdrubal, <hi>with whom, says he,
to my ruine I fell in love, she is passionately affected to her Country, and there's
no man can withstand what she desires, though I was your friend, her Charms
made me the friend of her Country, and from that happiness in which I lived, has
precipitated me into this misery, since therefore I am now at your dispose, and
being lost to</hi> Sophonisba, <hi>ought to fix my self to your interests; I give you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to be careful left that woman draw</hi> Masanissa <hi>from you, for there is no
hopes she should ever favor the</hi> Romans <hi>such a lover she is of her Country.</hi>
These things he said either because they were indeed true, or out of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
to prejudice <hi>Masanissa.</hi> After this <hi>Scipio</hi> having an esteem of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phax</hi>
prudence, and because he knew the Country, called him to the
Council of War and asked his advice, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> had formerly done with
<hi>Croesus</hi> King of <hi>Lydia. Lelius</hi> being come and assuring him of what had
been before told him concerning <hi>Sophonisba, Scipio</hi> required <hi>Masanissa</hi> to
deliver her into his hands, which he seeming averse to do, declaring what
had passed between him and that woman, <hi>Scipio</hi> urged it with more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor,
telling him he should not think to withhold by force any part of that
spoil which belonged to the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he ought first to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
her, and afterwards request her back if he thought convenient.
Whereupon he departed with some Romans to deliver <hi>Sophonisba</hi> into their
hands, but first he posted to her himself alone, and giving her a cup of
poison, told her there was but this choice, either to drink that, or be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Captive to <hi>Rome,</hi> and without saying word more remounted his horse
and returned: She having shewed the Cup to her Nurse and intreated her
not to mourn her death, since thus she died gloriously, presently drunk up
the poison. The Romans being come <hi>Masanissa</hi> exposed the body to their
view, and after having given it a funeral worthy a Queen, he returned to
wait on <hi>Scipio,</hi> who highly praised him, and to comfort him for the loss
of an evil woman, crowned him for the Victory gained over <hi>Syphax,</hi>
and made him most Magnificent presents. As for <hi>Syphax</hi> he being carried
to <hi>Rome,</hi> some were of opinion they ought to pardon a man, had served
them so well in <hi>Spain,</hi> others judged that he ought to be punished the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for having revolted from his friends, but whilst these things were in
debate he died of a distemper occasioned by grief.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Asdrubal</hi> had well excercised his Army, he sent a Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXI"/>
to <hi>Hanno</hi> General of the Carthaginians Army to entreat him to accept
him as a Companion in that charge, and withal to tell him that there were
some Spaniards in <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Army, who might be corrupted by mony and
promises to set on fire the <hi>Roman</hi> Camp, and there he would not fail to be
ready at the time appointed, if the General thought it convenient: <hi>Hanno</hi>
having received this advice, though he designed to deceive <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> yet
resolved to make use of it, and to that end sent one of his people into
<hi>Scipio</hi>'s Camp with good quantity of Silver; This man shelters himself there
as a Runaway and not being suspected by any one, corrupted many, and
after they had set a day for putting their design in execution, he returns
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65196:15"/>
to <hi>Hanno,</hi> who presently sends him to <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> but as <hi>Scipio</hi> sacrificed
the <hi>Aruspices</hi> having advertised him to beware of fire, he gave order to
one of his Domesticks to take care to see the fires put out in all places,
where such an accident might be feared. He continued for some days the
same sacrifices, and still the entrails threatned him with the same mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
which troubled him much and made him resolve to discamp, but
the plot was in this manner discovered. A Certain Roman Knight had a
Spanish slave who suspecting his companions had some mischievous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
feign'd himself of the party, and by that means having gain'd
knowledge of the whole enterprize, discovered it to his Master, his Master
brought him to <hi>Scipio,</hi> who causing the guilty wretches to be siezed on, put
them all to death, and made their bodies be thrown out of the Camp.
<hi>Hanno</hi> who was not far off having news of it, came not to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
<hi>Asdrubal</hi> who knew nothing of it, came, but seeing there so
many dead bodies, suspecting what had happened, retired. <hi>Hanno</hi> took
hence an occasion to criminate him, and to beget an ill opinion of him in
the minds of the Souldiery, giving out that he was come expresly to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
himself to <hi>Scipio,</hi> but that he refusing to accept him he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
and by this Calumny much increased the hatred the Carthaginians
bore him.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXII"/> About the same time <hi>Amilcar</hi> made an assault upon the Roman
Fleet, took a Galley and six ships of burthen; but <hi>Hanno</hi> having made an
attempt upon those that besieged <hi>Utica</hi> was repulsed and forced to a swift
retreat. <hi>Scipio</hi> however tyred with the length of that siege raised it without
more ado, and caused his Engins to be carried before <hi>Hypone,</hi> where find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no better success he burnt them as useless, and took the field drawing
thereby some Countries to his party, and pillaging others. Insomuch that
the Carthaginians astonished at so many losses and disasters, chose <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
General, and sent away ships for him, that he might make all the hast
he could for <hi>Africa,</hi> and in the mean time they sent deputies to <hi>Scipio</hi> to
treat of peace, hoping either to obtain it, or at least gain time enough for
<hi>Hannibals</hi> return. <hi>Scipio</hi> grants them truce, and having caused sufficient
victuals to be provided for his Army, gives them leave to send Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
to <hi>Rome</hi> to treat the peace with the Senate and people of <hi>Rome.</hi>
When they came thither they were received as enemies, for they lodged
them without the City, and when they had audience, no other proposition
was made to them but to crave pardon. One part of the Senators de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
against the perfidiousness of the Carthaginians, the breach of so
many treaties, the mischiefs <hi>Hannibal</hi> had done to the people of <hi>Rome</hi>
and their allies as well in <hi>Italy</hi> as <hi>Spain.</hi> But others remonstrated that the
Romans had more need of peace then the Carthaginians, seeing <hi>Italy</hi> was
almost ruined by so many Wars, besides there was much reason to fear so
many Fleets &amp; Armies being ready to pour upon <hi>Scypio</hi> at one instant, <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
going out of <hi>Italy; Mago</hi> out of <hi>Liguria,</hi> and <hi>Hanno</hi> being already
at <hi>Carthage.</hi> Upon all which the Senate not coming to any agreement:
sent the two opinions to <hi>Scipio</hi> to examine, with full Authority to act
whatever he thought most advantagious for the good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth:
he concluded a peace of which the Articles were, That the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians
should recal <hi>Mago</hi> out of <hi>Liguria,</hi> that for the future they
should entertain no foreign Souldiers under their pay, That they should
have no more then thirty long ships, That they should not extend their
Dominions farther then the place called the <hi>Punick</hi> ditch. That they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65196:15"/>
should deliver up all Captives and Runaways, and that within a limited
time they should bring sixteen hundred Talents into the publick Treasure.
To <hi>Masanissa</hi> likewise they granted by this Treaty, that he should enjoy not
only the Country of the Massesuliens, but likewise all he had Conquered of
<hi>Syphax</hi> his Dominions. These Articles being agreed upon, Deputies from
<hi>Carthage</hi> went to <hi>Rome,</hi> to swear before the Consuls to keep them inviol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and Commissioners went from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Carthage</hi> to receive the Oath
of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Magistrates. This peace thus sworn, the people of <hi>Rome</hi>
gave <hi>Masanissa</hi> as an acknowledgment of his fidelity, and the services he
had done them, a Crown of Gold, a Cup of Gold, a Chariot of Ivory, a
Cloak of Purple, a Robe after the Roman Fashion, a Horse trapped with
Gold, and a compleat Suit of Armor.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Hanniba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> sets sail for <hi>Carthage,</hi> much against <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIII"/>
his own inclination: for he had no confidence in the people of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
whom he knew distrustful of their Magistrates, and headlong in their
Counsels, and believing the peace not yet concluded, or that if it were it
would not last long, he lands at <hi>Adrumetum.</hi> As soon as he was on shore
he sends all about to seek for Corn, gives Order to buy horses, Allies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with the Prince of the <hi>Areacides</hi> who are a Nation of <hi>Numidia.</hi> He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to be shot to death with Arrows, four thousand Horsemen that had
formerly served <hi>Syphax,</hi> afterwards <hi>Masanissa,</hi> and now at last came to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
themselves to him, because he had a suspition of them, but their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
he divided among his own people. Another Prince named <hi>Mesetulus</hi>
came likewise to joyn with him with <hi>Vermina</hi> one of the Sons of <hi>Syphax,</hi>
who yet held a great part of his fathers Kingdom; Moreover he siezed on
some of the Cities belonging to <hi>Masanissa</hi> partly by surrender, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by force, and <hi>Nar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e</hi> he took by surprize in this manner: being in want of
provisions he sent to them as to his friends till having found an opportunity
he caused a great many of his people to enter Armed only with Daggers
under their Coats, with Orders not to offer any affront to the Merchants
till they heard the noise of the Trumpet, but then to kill all they met,
and make themselves Masters of the Gates, thus was this City taken; On
the other side, though the peace was so lately made, <hi>Scipio</hi> yet upon the
place, and the Carthaginians Deputies not gone from <hi>Rome,</hi> yet some
ships laden with provision for the Romans (having by storm been driven
into the Port of <hi>Carthage)</hi> the Common People pillaged them and put the
Mariners in Irons, notwithstanding all the threats of the Senate against
this seditious rabble, and all the prohibition made against violating a Peace
they had so lately sworn. They cryed out to excuse themselves, that the
treaty was not just, and that they were more apprehensive of famine then
of any danger could arrive by the breach of the peace. Though <hi>Scipio</hi>
were much offended at this action; yet he would not revive the war, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
once made peace: only he sent to demand satisfaction by the way of
Justice as of friends that had forgot their duty, but the people would needs
have arrested those who came on the behalf of the Romans, till such time
as their deputies were returned from <hi>Rome.</hi> But <hi>Hanno</hi> the Great
and <hi>Asdrubal</hi> Surnamed the Great rescued them out of the hands of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and sent them back on two Gallies which they fitted out, of which
some gave notice to <hi>Asdrubal</hi> Admiral of the Fleet, who then rode at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
near the Promontory of <hi>Apollo,</hi> perswading him to watch the passage
of those Gallies, and set upon them, which he so violently performed that
two of the Roman deputies were slain with arrows, and the others almost
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65196:16"/>
overpressed with showers of Darts, with much difficulty saved themselves
in the Port where their ships lay, and had they not nimbly leapt from one
of the Gallies which was already grapled with by the enemy, they had
without doubt been taken prisoners. When news of this came to <hi>Rome</hi>
the Deputies of <hi>Carthage,</hi> who were still in that City to compleat the
treaty, were Commanded by the Senate to depart immediately out of <hi>Italy</hi>
as enemies of the Republick, whereupon they took ship to return to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
but were driven by storm to the place where <hi>Scipio</hi> lay encamped.
his Admiral took them, and sent to him to know what should be done
with them, <hi>Nothing,</hi> said he, <hi>of what the Carthaginians have done,</hi> and so
without any more ado they were sent home. The Ancients of <hi>Carthage</hi>
(that is to say a body of the most prudent and honest men) hearing of
this Excellent goodness of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s and comparing the injury they had done
to the Romans with the favor they had received, began to declaim against
the rashness of their fellow Citizens, and to Counsel them they would yet
observe the treaty, which might still be done if they ask'd <hi>Scipio</hi> pardon
for their fault, and submitted to pay a fine, but the people already anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
against the Senate by reason of the miseries of the war which they
imputed to the ill Conduct of that Noble body, and set on likewise by some
seditious spirits suffered themselves to be transported with vain hopes, and
caused <hi>Hannibal</hi> to advance with his Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIV"/> That Captain considering the importance of this war perswaded
the Carthaginians to call <hi>Asdrubal</hi> with those forces he had to their assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
Whereupon <hi>Asdrubal</hi> was by the Senate absolved of those crimes
he stood charged with, having first consigned over his Army to <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
Yet he durst not publickly show himself in the City for fear of the people,
but kept concealed in the house of one of his friends. Mean while <hi>Scipio</hi>
caused his Fleet to lie before <hi>Carthage</hi> that he might hinder all provision
coming by Sea, and the in-land could furnish no great quantity, by reason
that during the war they could not till the ground. About the same time
happened a fight near <hi>Zama</hi> between <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi>'s horse, in which
the Romans had the advantage. After which happened several skirmishes
for some days together, but of little consequence, till such time as <hi>Scipio</hi>
understanding that <hi>Hannibal</hi> wanted provisions, and that he expected a
supply, caused a Tribune called <hi>Thermus</hi> to march in the Night to intercept
them, who having taken an advantagious post, upon an eminence near
unto a strait, they must of necessity pass, slew four thousand Africans, took
as many Prisoners and brought the Conway to <hi>Scipio.</hi> In so much that
<hi>Hannibal</hi> beholding himself reduced to an extream necessity, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
what he should do in such a conjuncture, resolved to send messengers
to <hi>Masanissa</hi> to represent to him that he had been bred in <hi>Carthage,</hi> and had
there passed a considerable part of his life, entreating him to labor a peace
between <hi>Scipio</hi> and him by beseeching him to believe that if any thing of
ill had happened, the fault was to be imputed to the people, or to some
particular men more foolish then the people, <hi>Masanissa</hi> remembring that
he had indeed been bred and brought up in that City whose Majesty he
still reverenced, and where he likewise had a great many particular
friends, besought <hi>Scipio</hi> with so good a grace that he consented the Treaty
should be renewed, on condition that the people of <hi>Carthage</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
to the Romans the ship, men, and provisions, they had taken, or pay
for what could not be restored at the price, whereas <hi>Scipio</hi> should value
them, and for a fine deposite one thousand talents. These Conditions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65196:16"/>
agreed on, a Truce was granted till such time as the Articles should
be carried to <hi>Carthage.</hi> Thus <hi>Hannibal</hi> saved himself beyond his own
hopes. When the Senate of <hi>Carthage</hi> saw this agreement they approved
it, and intreated the people to give their consent by representing to them
the long train of miseries would else ensue, and the deep necessities they
were in of men, mony, and provisions. But the Populacy (as it is the
Custom of the Vulgar) believed that the Chiefs in making this peace
labored only their private interest, that being fortified with the friendship
of the Romans they might become more powerful in the Country.
That <hi>Hannibal</hi> had now done the same thing <hi>Asdrubal</hi> did before, who
having first by night betrayed his Army would afterwards have surrendred
himself to <hi>Scipio,</hi> having for that end approached his Camp, and lay now
concealed in the City. These discourses raised a Tumult among the
people with terrible crys and Exclamations, and many of them leaving the
assembly ran presently to find out <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> who a little before was reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into the Sepulchre of his Father, having first poisoned himself. But
they drew him thence dead as he was, cut off his head, and setting it on a
Pike carried it through the City. Thus was <hi>Asdrubal</hi> first banished with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having deserved it, afterwards <hi>Hanno</hi> accused him falsely, and at last
his own Citizens forced him to become his own Murderer, and when he
was dead exposed his body to a thousand indignities.</p>
               <p>After having treated <hi>Asdrubal</hi> in this manner they forthwith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXV"/>
sent to <hi>Hannibal</hi> to break the truce and make war with <hi>Scipio,</hi> ordering
him to give him battel as soon as he could, because of the scarcity they
were in. As soon as the truce was broke, <hi>Scipio</hi> presently took a
great City called <hi>Partha,</hi> and that done went and encamped near <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi>
who immediately discamped: He had three several times sent spies
into the Roman Camp, who being discovered and taken, <hi>Scipio</hi> would not
put them to death, according to the Law's of war, but made them be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
through the whole Camp, that they might view his Stores, his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
of War, and his Army imbattelled, and so without doing them any
injury sent them back to <hi>Hannibal</hi> to give him an account of what they
had seen. The Carthaginians surprized at this manner of proceeding, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a conference, which being granted, he told <hi>Scipio; That the people
of</hi> Carthage <hi>could not perform that treaty because of the too great sum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
demanded of them, but if he would please to remit any thing of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and that the people of</hi> Rome <hi>would content themselves with</hi> Sicily,
Spain, <hi>and the Islands they now held, the peace would become both firm and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
To which <hi>Scipio</hi> answered, <hi>That</hi> Hannibal <hi>would be fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed
for having by flight quitted</hi> Italy, <hi>if those propositions were
agreed to,</hi> adding not a word more, but the forbidding him to send any
further Messages. So after some threats on one part and the other, each
retired to his Camp. There was not far distant a City called <hi>Cilla,</hi> near
which was a rising ground, very proper to encamp in, <hi>Hannibal</hi> having
designed to lodge himself there, sends his vanguard before to possess it,
whilst he followed with the rest of the Army. But finding <hi>Scipio</hi> had first
siesed it, he was forced to pass away all that night in the midst of a dry
plain, sorely pestered to sink wells, where after all the Army had wrought
hard, and thrown up mountains of sand, their mighty pains was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
with the finding but of one well, and that of troubled water, of
which the Souldiers drank greedily, without eating, or any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency.
There were likewise many of them stood in Arms all night.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65196:17"/>
                  <hi>Scipio,</hi> who knew all this well enough, was not wanting to assail them
next morning harrassed as they were with marching, thirst and want of
sleep. It grieved <hi>Hannibal</hi> to the heart to see himself forced to fight thus
unseasonably, yet he saw plainly that if he staid there, he should be intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably
straitned for want of water, and if he drew off, his retreat would
increase the enemies courage, who would certainly fall on in his rear, for
these reasons therefore he resolved to fight, and presently drew into Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia
fifty thousand men and fourscore Elephants.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVI"/> Those mighty creatures he disposed in Equal distances in the
Front of the battel, to strike fear into the Romans. Then he composed
his vanguard of Gauls and Ligurians, and among them intermixed his
bowmen and slingers, who were Moors and people of the Isles <hi>Baleares.</hi>
In his main body he placed the Carthaginians and Africans, and in his rear
those Italians that had followed his fortune, in whom he had great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
because they dreaded to be overcome. His Cavalry made his two
Wings. As for <hi>Scipio</hi> he had three and twenty thousand foot, and fifteen

                  </gap>ides <hi>Masanissa</hi> had a stout body
of Numidian horse; and another Prince of that Country, called
<hi>Dachamas,</hi> had six hundred auxiliary horse. He divided his Army into
three battalia's, Vanguard, Main-body and Rear-guard, as <hi>Hannibal</hi> had
done his, save only he kept his battalia's at a more open Order, that
the horse upon occasion might have passage between. In the front
of every battalia he placed men with stakes the most part Armed
with Iron at the ends, and about two<note n="*" place="margin">Or a Yard.</note> Cubits long, that they
might better repulse the Elephants by striking them at hand with these
sort of Truncheons, giving Order to the foot to avoid the shock of
those great beasts by opening to the right and left, when they
made at them, and to pursue them incessantly when they were past with
darts and arrows, or hamstring them with their Swords, if they could get so
near them. Having thus ordered his foot, he disposed the Numidian Cavalry
on his two wings, because the Numidian horses are accustomed to the
smell and sight of Elephants; wherefore fearful lest the Italian horses
should be frightned, he placed them in the Rear-guard that they might
charge between the bodies, and support the infantry whilst they fought
against the Elephants, and to every horseman he gave a light Armed Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
and great quantity of darts, wherewith to chase away those Monsters
if they came upon them. His Cavalry being thus disposed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e gave the
Command of the right wing to <hi>Lelius,</hi> of the left to <hi>Octavius,</hi> and himself
took Charge of the main battel. <hi>Hannibal</hi> did the same, and as if these
two great Captains had acted by the same Spirit, they each kept near
their persons a strong body of horse, ready to move on all sides to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of those, stood in need. <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s party consisted of four thousand
horse. <hi>Scipio</hi>'s only of two thousand, besides those three hundred Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
to whom he had given Arms in <hi>Sicily.</hi> Both Armies thus drawn up
for battel, each General went through the Ranks to incourage his people.
<hi rend="margQuotes">
                     <hi>Scipio</hi> publickly invoked the Gods who having been witnesses of their
Treaties, had been affronted by the Carthaginians as often as they had
violated them, exhorting his Souldiers not so much to consider the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of their enemies as their own proper Vertue, which had already
made them Victorious over the same enemies in the same province, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating
to them that though their having always overcome, should
not clear all their doubts of the success of this battel; Yet the Africans
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65196:17"/>
having been always beaten would make them despair.</hi> Thus did
<hi>Scipio</hi> hearten up his men encouraging them not to think of the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Number. <hi>Hannibal</hi> on the other side desired his <hi rend="margQuotes">to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
those brave acts they had done, and the noble victories they had
gained not only against the Numidians, but throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> setting
forth at the same time the inconsiderable number of their enemies, and
exhorting them so to act that the greater number might not be beaten
by the less, nor the natural inhabitants of the Country shamefully for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to yield to strangers.</hi> In short both Generals set forth with the most
pressing arguments they could invent, the consequences of that battel<hi rend="margQuotes">.
<hi>Hannibal</hi> told his men that they now disputed whether <hi>Carthage</hi> and
with it all <hi>Africa</hi> should command, or be for ever hereafter inslaved.</hi>
And <hi>Scipio</hi> let the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers know <hi rend="margQuotes">that if they suffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be vanquished they had no place of retreat, but if they gained
the victory the advantages reaped by it would be increase of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the end of their labors, the so much desired leave of
returning into their Country, and with all immortal glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Orations ended, the Carthaginian Trumpets sounded a charge, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVII"/>
the Roman soon did the like. The battel was begun by the Elephants
which came furiously on, being sharply pricked forward by those mounted
on them; Those which assailed the wings were stopt by the Numidian
horse with showers of Darts, and being wounded turned against their
own party, so that their governors no longer able to rule them were forced
to draw them out of the battel, both wings had alike advantage, but those
which charged on the main body put the Romans hard to it, who were not
accustomed to this manner of fight, and could not easily by reason of the
weight of their arms move either to shun or assail them, till such time as
<hi>Scipio</hi> caused the Rear guard of Italian horse, and the Souldiers lightly
armed to advance to the relief of his foot. And because the horse were
fearful of those beasts, he commanded his horsemen to alight, and with
their darts charge the Elephants, who had caused a great disorder, and to
oblige them by his own Example, himself alighted first and wounded an
Elephant that came towards him, which so heartned the Romans, that
discharging their darts on all sides they so wounded those creatures that
they forced them to retreat like the others. These beasts thus driven out
of the battel they had nothing now to encounter but men and horses. The
right wing Commanded by <hi>Lelius</hi> had put to flight the Numidians that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
them, after that <hi>Masanissa</hi> had wounded their Prince <hi>Macinta,</hi> but
<hi>Hannibal</hi> coming speedily to their assistance renewed the fight. In the left
wing where <hi>Octavius</hi> had to do with Gauls and Ligurians, they fought with
equal fortune. <hi>Scipio</hi> sent thither the Tribune <hi>Therinus</hi> with some chosen
troops; but <hi>Hannibal</hi> having reinforced his left wing speeds away to the
relief of the Gauls and Ligurians, taking with him all his Carthaginians
and Africans, which <hi>Scipio</hi> perceiving was forced to do the like, and made
his main battel advance. And now these two mighty Captains fighting
in person, the Souldiers encouraged by the sight of them did acts incredible.
All feared to yield, all fought with a wonderful alacrity, exhorting, exciting
and encouraging one another. At length victory having long hung in
equal Ballance, the Generals moved with compassion to see their Souldiers
out of breath, fiercely charged each other, the sooner to put an end to the
battel; at the same instant both discharged their darts, <hi>Scipio</hi>'s stuck in
<hi>Hannibal</hi>'s buckler, and <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s hurt <hi>Scipio</hi>'s horse, who feeling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65196:18"/>
wounded overthrew his Master to the ground. But <hi>Scipio</hi> nimbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting
on another, discharges a second dart at <hi>Hannibal,</hi> which
took no better effect then the former, save only it wounded a horseman that
sat near his Captain. Mean while <hi>Masanissa</hi> having notice comes in, and the
Roman Souldiers seeing their General perform not only the part of a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
but of a Private Souldier, fighting for them, gave so home a Charge
that they put the enemy to flight. As they followed the pursuit, <hi>Hannibal</hi>
gained the front of his own men, endeavouring all he could to stop them
and lead them back to fight, but in vain. At last since from them he could
obtain nothing, he has recourse to those Italians he had brought with him,
who yet kept firm in their Post, and makes them advance towards the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
hoping whilst the Romans were eager in pursuit of the flyers he might
the easier put them in disorder, but they perceiving his design stopt as if a
retreat had been sounded and drew up into order. The horse had now left
them and their darts were spent, so they were forced to close with the enemy
and come to Swords point. And now was a terrible slaughter nothing
to be heard but the groans of dying men and the shouts of those that slew
them, till such time as the enemy were totally routed, the victory no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
doubted of, and <hi>Hannibal,</hi> had betaken himself to flight. As he fled
he perceived some Numidian horse still in a body, to them he goes and
begs them not to forsake him, and as soon as they had given him their
word turns upon his pursuers with great hopes of defeating them. They
were by chance Massesuliens, so that <hi>Masanissa</hi> and <hi>Hannibal</hi> came to fight
hand to hand. In this Combat <hi>Hannibal</hi> received a blow on his buckler,
and at the same instant slew his enemies horse. <hi>Masanissa</hi> getting up and
seeking for <hi>Hannibal.</hi> on foot slew with a dart a horseman that encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
him, and received in his buckler, which was of Elephants skin, seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
darts, one of which he snatches out and throws at <hi>Hannibal,</hi> but by
misfortune another horseman received the stroke and lost his life, and as
he strove to pull out another he was wounded in the arm, and forced for a
while to retire out of the fight. <hi>Scipio</hi> hearing of this rancounter was in
fear for <hi>Masanissa,</hi> but as he was going to relieve him, he found that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
bound up his wound he was returning to the fight mounted on a fresh
horse, so the battel being renewed, they fought couragiously on either
side, when <hi>Hannibal</hi> perceiving on a little hill, a squadron of Spaniards
and Gauls, spurred towards them to bring them into his assistance, which
gave occasion to the others unacquainted with the reason of his departure,
and believing he fled, to become quite heartless, and betake themselves to
a disorderly flight, not after <hi>Hannibal,</hi> but every one where fortune led
him. The Romans seeing the Enemy thus dispersed thought themselves
assured of the victory, and began without any order to follow the chase;
for they knew not <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s design, who presently returning to the
Charge at the head of those Spaniards and Gauls, <hi>Scipio</hi> was forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
his men again from the pursuit, and speedily put them in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Enemy, whom they had no great difficulty to overcome, being a
far greater number then those descended from the hill. <hi>Hannibal</hi> seeing
this last push had no better success then the former, and that all was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
lost, fled likewise, pursued by many, and among others by <hi>Masa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa,</hi>
who notwithstanding the pain &amp; inconveniency of his wound followed
him close at the heels, out of the passionate desire he had to take him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
and present him to <hi>Scipio,</hi> but by the favor of the night which came
on he escaped his hands, and at last accompained only with twenty horse,
which were all could follow him, gained as far as a City called <hi>Tunis,</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65196:18"/>
where he met several horsemen as well Brutians as Spaniards who had
there saved themselves after the defeat, but knowing the Spaniards to be
rash and Barbarous, and the Brutians to be Italians of the same Country
with <hi>Scipio,</hi> he was fearful left to obtain pardon for the fault, they had
committed in bearing arms against their Country, they should deliver him
up to his enemy, and so departed secretly by night, accompanied only
with one horseman in whom he had confidence, so that having rode in
two days and two nights almost three thousand furlongs he arrived at
<hi>Adrumetum</hi> which is a Sea-town where finding some troops he had left as
guards to his stores of Corn, and drawing together forces from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumadjacent
places, and rallying all those had escaped from the battel, he
began again to make preparation of Arms and Engines of War. But
<hi>Scipio</hi> having gained this noble victory, burnt with his own hands, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Custom of the Roman Generals, those spoils of the enemy that
were of small moment, sending the choicest and most precious to <hi>Rome,</hi>
ten talents of Gold, two thousand five hundred talents of Silver, many
moveables of Ivory, whole Ships loading of Prisoners, the most part
Gentlemen, with <hi>Lelius</hi> to carry the new's. The remainder he sold, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributing
the mony among the Souldiers, giving Military rewards to such
as had served him well, particularly a Crown to <hi>Masanissa;</hi> and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
become absolute Master of the field he made himself Master of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Such was the success of this battel fought in <hi>Africa</hi> between <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
and <hi>Scipio,</hi> who never before had dealings with each other. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
lost two thousand five hundred men, <hi>Masanissa</hi> somewhat more,
there died of the enemies five and twenty thousand, besides eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
eight hundred taken prisoners, three hundred Spaniards that yielded
to <hi>Scipio,</hi> and eight hundred Numidians to <hi>Masanissa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now before the News of this Victory was brought either to <hi>Rome</hi> or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVIII"/>
                  <hi>Carthage,</hi> the Carthaginians had writ to <hi>Mago,</hi> who was then raising forces
in <hi>Gaul</hi> with Orders to make an irruption into <hi>Italy</hi> if it were possible, or
else to come over into <hi>Africa</hi> with such power as he might have raised,
but these Letters being intercepted and brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> were the occasion
of the Senates sending recruits of foot and horse, with Ships and Mony
to <hi>Scipio,</hi> who after this defeat made <hi>Octavius</hi> March with his Army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Carthage,</hi> whither he designed to follow with his Fleet. But when
the Carthaginians understood that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was defeated, they sent their
Deputies to meet <hi>Scipio,</hi> the chief of which were <hi>Hanno</hi> the great, and
<hi>Asdrubal</hi> furnamed the <hi>Goat,</hi> they went in a passage Boat, on the Prow
of which they planted a <hi>Caduceus,</hi> and at their arrival stretched forth
their hands joyned towards the Conqueror, like people imploring mercy.
<hi>Scipio</hi> ordered them to meet him at the Camp, where being seated in the
Tribunal he caused them to be brought to his presence, whither being
come they cast themselves on their knees weeping, till being raised up by
the Ushers, and having permission to speak, <hi>Asdrubal</hi> began in this manner.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Most certain it is Sirs, that neither <hi>Hanno</hi> whom you see here, nor
my self, nor any person of wisdom in all <hi>Cart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>age,</hi> are guilty of those
crimes wherewith you charge us, for when our unhappy Citizens op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by famine injured those sent from you, we opposed our selves,
and sent them back to you. Nor ought the people of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to be accused, who sent their deputies, and of whom the most part
signed the Articles with joy, but as the Populacy suffer themselves
to be easily seduced to their own ruine, whatever is pleasing to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65196:19"/>
is usually preferred before that which is most profitable. We our
selves have had experience of it, for what ever propositions we have
made, some private calumniators, who never had the boldness to discover
their thoughts in our presence, have hindred us from being believed.
Wherefore Sirs, Judge not of our affairs, by what is practised in <hi>Rome,</hi>
for your discipline in your Counsels is extreamly different from ours,
and if by chance our crime seem to some greater then the calamity that
constrained it, let him consider that hunger is a pinching necessity, and
that that was the principal cause of our misfortunes: for had we not
been pressed by it, it is not to be believed that the same people who had
but newly demanded peace, offered so much mony, parted with the
greatest patt of their Dominion, sworn to observe the Articles of Peace,
and sent to that purpose deputies to your Senate, should be violently hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on to offend you, without expecting the return of those they had
sent. But we must attribute this accident to the anger of some God, and
to the tempest which cast your provisions into our Port; in a time when
almost all <hi>Carthage</hi> was ready to perish with hunger, hunger that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
counsellor against anothers goods, especially in the brests of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
wanting all things, 'twould be certainly a piece of injustice to punish
with severity what this miserable multitude have done. Yet if you will
impute this fault rather to our malice then our misery, we confess it, we
crave pardon for it. Were we innocent, we would endeavor to justifie
our selves, but being criminals we supplicate for grace, hoping that you
who are in the top of prosperity will the easier grant it, if you consider
that humane affairs are subject to strange reverses, and that those who
were yesterday in a condition to do injuries, are to day under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of imploring mercy. You may behold, Sirs, a fresh example in
the unhappy City of <hi>Carthage,</hi> she that for seven hundred years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>has
been the greatest and most powerful City of all <hi>Africa,</hi> powerful in
Ships, in Silver, in Elephants, in Foot, in Horse, She whose Dominion
extended over the Lybians, and over many Cities and Isles by Sea and
Land, in short She that has so long been the Rival of your Empire, Now
no more places her hope in her Ports, nor in her Ships, nor in her
Horse, nor in her Elephants, nor in her Provinces, which she has quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to you, but she expects her safety from your mercy, You that she
has heretofore so ill treated. You will do an Action worthy of your
selves, if considering the deplorable Estate to which we are reduced,
you will receive a moderation in the midst of your prosperity, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
regard as well to your own accustomed generosity, as to the
ancient felicity of <hi>Carthage,</hi> you will in our misery make such a use of
the favors of fortune, as may not displease the immortal Gods, but that
by your clemency you will acquire a glorious name, that can never die
whilst there is memory among men. Nor need you hereafter more
fear the perfidiousness of <hi>Carthage,</hi> the chastisement they receive for
their past faults will be an eternal warning to them: and as the good
Counsel they had given them, but despised, had kept them in bounds
of duty, so now they have been faulty, repentance joyned with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
inflicted on them, will prevent their falling again, and whilst
you inveigh against the cruelty and injustice of the Carthaginians, you
should be careful lest you fall into the same crimes, for as poverty of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
occasions men to sin, those who are in prosperity have opportunity
to exercise their humanity and goodness, thus it is of concern both to
the honor, and the advantage of your Commonwealth, rather to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65196:19"/>
so great a City, than to destroy it; but you may act as you please:
for our parts we have but two things to oppose in our defence, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Dignity of the Carthaginian Empire, and that Noble Moderation
you have used to the rest of the World, which joyned with your Valour,
hath raised you to so high a Soveraignty: And for what concerns the
conditions of the Treaty, we only desire Peace; for Terms we have none
to propose, leaving them wholly to your Discretion.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Asdrubal</hi> finish'd his Oration with tears: upon which <hi>Scipio</hi> causing the
Deputies to retire, held a Council about this important Affair with the
principal Officers of the Army; and after a long deliberation, caused the
Carthaginians to return, to whom he spake in this manner:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>You are not worthy of pardon, after having so often violated your
Faith, and having, as a complement of all, so evilly treated our Deputies:
A truth so manifest, that by your own confession, there is no punishment
whatsoever, which you deserve not, for the expiation of your crimes:
but it is needless to reproach you with faults your selves confess. And
now you have recourse to prayers: you, that had you gain'd the Victory,
would have rooted out even the Roman Name. We have not treated
you at the like rate, but sent back your Agents from our City, at the same
time you had injured ours, and violated the Treaty: and those very A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
being by the Sea cast into our Camp, and War already declared, I
sent back to you without offering them the least wrong. Therefore in
the condition your affairs are reduced to, you cannot believe we will or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you any thing advantageous. I will therefore tell you my thoughts,
if the Senate approve them, if they think it convenient, we will yet
grant you peace, on condition you surrender into the hands of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Rome</hi> all your Ships of War, save only ten, and all your Elephants:
That you restore all you have taken from us, or the value of what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be found; in the estimation of which, if any difference arise, I will
be Judge: That you likewise deliver up all the Captives and Fugitives,
and all those Italian Souldiers, who followed <hi>Hannibal</hi> into <hi>Africa,</hi> which
must be performed within a month after the day of publication of the
Peace: That within two months you cause <hi>Mago</hi> to return out of <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guria:</hi>
That you withdraw all Garrisons out of such Cities as are beyond
the Punick Ditch, and send them back their Hostages: That besides all
this you pay us yearly for fifty years, two hundred and fifty Euboick Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents:
That for the future you entertain no Soldiers into your pay, either
out of <hi>Gaul</hi> or <hi>Liguria:</hi> That you make not any war upon <hi>Masanissa,</hi>
or any of our Allies, nor permit any Carthaginian to bear Arms against
them; then shall your City and Territory remain free to you within the
Punick Ditch, limited by the same bounds you possessed when I entred
<hi>Africa,</hi> provided you put a just value on the friendship of the people of
<hi>Rome;</hi> and if occasion requires, assist them with your Forces by Sea and
Land. If the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> approve these propositions, the Roman Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
shall depart out of <hi>Lybia,</hi> within fifty days after the ratification; to
perfect which, if you will send Deputies to <hi>Rome,</hi> I will in the mean time
grant you Truce, and you shall deliver me in Hostage one hundred and
fifty of such of your Children as I shall chuse, and pay me a thousand
Talents for the Armies entertainment; besides such Provisions as you
shall furnish. As for the Hostages I will return them so soon as the Peace
is ratified.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Deputies carried back this answer to <hi>Carthage,</hi> where after many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIX"/>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:65196:20"/>
deliberations, the principal Men of the City advised the accepting of these
Conditions, left whilst they made a difficulty of quitting part of what they
possessed, they should run in danger of loosing all. But the multitude,
who ordinarily consider more what is taken from them, than what is left
them, opposing it, thinking it mighty strange that the Elders of <hi>Carthage</hi>
should in a publick famine, chuse rather to send Provisions to the Roman Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
than to their own Citizens; and in effect, they went to seek out eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular Senator, threatning them all to plunder and fire their Houses.
At last it was agreed on to send for <hi>Hannibal</hi> into the Council, who having
gathered together six thousand Foot, and five hundred Horse, was retired
into the City of <hi>Marthame.</hi> He comes, and though the most moderate
men were fearful lest that warlike Men should absolutely pervert the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
yet by a grave Discourse he made, he perswaded to Peace; but the
Populacy incensed, and insolent railed no less at him than they had done at
others, and continued their threatnings, till such time as all the Nobility
despairing of the affairs of the City, left it; one part returning to <hi>Masa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa,</hi>
and the other to the Roman Army. Now the remainder of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
having intelligence that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had stored up great quantities of Corn
in a certain place—</p>
               <p>—<q>That is unjust, and looks like a malicious emulation, and it seems
in effect,<note place="margin">There wants here a leaf in the Original, so that this which follows seems part of an Oration made by a Roman Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in open Senate, while Peace was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated.</note> 
                     <hi>Scipio</hi> himself doubted of it; when opening his thoughts to us,
he adds, That he would grant peace to the Carthaginians, even though
we should refuse it: And indeed, there is reason to believe, that being
upon the place he should see clearer, and have a more exact knowledge
of affairs than we possibly can. In short, if we slight his advice, we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
that great Captain, who out of his passionate love to his Country,
always counselled the carrying of the War into <hi>Africa;</hi> and when he
could not obtain an Army from us, raised one at his own expence, and
has succeeded more happily than we could hope: So that it strangely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazes
me, to see you now so obstinate, and with such violence to press
forward this War to extremity, which in the beginning you undertook
with so much coldness and negligence. If any of the opposers of Peace
grant all this, and shall only found their advice upon a fear, left the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians
should now again, as they have done formerly, violate the
Treaty in question. I answer, that there is more reason to believe, that
having had experience of the miseries their infidelity has involved them
in, and being perswaded, as they are, that all these misfortunes have
fallen upon them, only for having violated the Religion of their Oaths,
they will for the future keep sacred that Faith they shall swear to. And
to me it appears an evident contradiction to say, that the Carthaginians
are contemptible, because they have no more power, and at the same
time to fear that they are in a capacity of revolting. Besides, it is much
easier for us to hinder the growth of power, than totally to ruine them;
for if we press them to extremities, we shall have to deal with people,
whom despair will make capable of any thing: but if you grant them
Peace, the fear of falling into the like danger, will preserve them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the bounds of Duty: but besides all this, they will have persecutors
enough, though we concern not our selves; for not any of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
but remembring the Pride and Tyranny of their Empire, will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
against them an irreconcileable War: after all this, we have <hi>Masanissa</hi>
(who has been our most faithful friend in all adventures) still upon the
place, who will continually cast an eye on their actions, and be always
ready to oppose whatever they dare attempt. But if any one not considering
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65196:20"/>
all these reasons, has regard only to the glorious success of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s
Arms, and promises himself the like in the continuance of this War:
let him remember the inconstancy of Fortune, and that no man living can
assure himself to have it at all times favourable. But granting we take the
City of <hi>Carthage,</hi> what shall we do with it? shall we utterly ruine and
raze it, because they took some of our Corn and Shipping, which they are
ready to pay for with interest? Certainly we shall not, lest we incurr
the indignation of Gods and Men. Shall we give it to <hi>Masanissa?</hi> No,
for though he be our friend, we must not raise him above measure:
Much better may we make use of those contracts he shall have with the
Carthaginians, to the advantage of the Commonwealth. Perhaps we
might draw some Treasure thence, but the Armies that must be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
will waste it: for who can doubt but there must be great Forces
kept up for the guard of a Country encompassed with so many barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Nations. We may likewise send thither a Colony of Italians; but
upon terms to hold eternal War with the people of <hi>Numidia,</hi> or if those
we send shall in process of time make themselves Masters of all these
Nations, it may happen that having conquered so great a Country,
without comparison more excellent than ours, their power may render
them not only suspected, but even terrible to our selves. And this in my
opinion, was <hi>Scipio</hi>'s judgement, when he advised us to grant the
Carthaginians the effect of their demands. Let us not therefore, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
refuse them, as well because we now behold them our humble sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyants,
as because our General desires it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this <hi>Cornelius Lentulus,</hi> kinsman to <hi>Cneus,</hi> now Consul, who hoped
to suceed <hi>Scipio</hi> in this War, answered in this manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Gentlemen, it is ordinary in War to consider only advantage; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
since we all agree, that this City may yet be able to do mischief,
we ought to take heed of that Infidelity is accompanied with Power:
And we cannot assure our selves against its Perfidy. I am of opinion
we ought, before all other things, to deprive it utterly of the means to
do hurt: We can never have a more favourable opportunity, and since
they are weak and poor, we should commit a great errour to stay till
they have recovered Force and Riches; not that I would argue we ought
not likewise have regard to that which is just. But who can accuse the
Roman people of injustice, or think they use with too much severity the
Victory they have gained over the Carthaginians, a people who in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
are unjust and violent to all the World, who in adversity submit and
humble themselves; and as soon as they have obtained Peace and Pardon,
violate that Peace they have sworn to? They have no respect for Oaths,
they believe not that there are Gods; yet he that spoke before me says,
we ought to spare them to avoid the indignation of Men and Gods: For
my part I believe those very Gods have reduced <hi>Carthage</hi> to this very state,
to punish the impieties of people, who besides the violation of so many
Treaties of Peace made in <hi>Sicily, Spain, Italy</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> have by a
thousand wrongs provoked the whole World. I will give some forreign
Examples before I speak of those concern us. <hi>Saguntum,</hi> one of the
fairest Cities of all <hi>Spain,</hi> was entred into Alliance with us, nay more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
was a friend to the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet without any occasion
of complaint given they took it, sack'd it, and put all to the Sword, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sparing Sex or Age. The City of <hi>Nucera,</hi> which depended upon us,
surrendred to them upon composition, after they had sworn that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
should be permitted to pass freely, with two Suits of Apparel each,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65196:21"/>
yet, to the prejudice of their Oath, they shut up the Senators of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
City in Stoves, where they smothered them to death, and slew
all the people with Darts, as they passed out. After having engaged their
Faith to the Senators of <hi>Acerra,</hi> they threw them into Wells, and buried
them alive under the Earth they cast down upon them. They deceived
<hi>M. Cornelius</hi> our Consul, whom by force of Oaths they prevailed with to
go see their General, who feigned himself sick; and from <hi>Sicily,</hi> where
they were, carried him prisoner into <hi>Africa,</hi> with two and twenty of our
Ships. They likewise cruelly put to death our General <hi>Regulus,</hi> who that
he might not violate his Oath, returned to <hi>Carthage.</hi> In short, <hi>Hannibal</hi>
has committed so many cruelties, during the War, by Surprise and by
Treachery, both against us and against his own Allies, plundring their
Cities, and putting to death those engaged in his Service, that it is not
possible to express it; let me only say in a few words, that he has sack'd
four hundred of our Cities; that he hath made Bridges over Rivers of
the Bodies of Roman Prisoners, and filled Ditches with them as with
Fagots, whereon to pass his men over: Sometimes he has trampled them
under the feet of his Elephants; otherwhiles exposed them as a specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
making them like Gladiators fight Brother against Brother, and Son
against Father. They sent us but very lately, Deputies of theirs to
conclude a Peace, which they swore to; and yet before they were gone
from our City, rob'd our Ships, and put our Mariners in Irons. These
are the works of their cruelty; now what commiseration or kindness
is there due to those, who have never used moderation or clemency
to any person, and who would (as <hi>Scipio</hi> told them) have abolished the
very Roman Name, had they overcome us. Perhaps this time they will
keep their Faith, but what Faith, what Treaties, what Oaths have they not
violated? What Peace or what Favour have they not repaid with Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
Some may say we are not to imitate them. Pray, wherein do we
imitate them? We break not the Peace, since it is not yet agreed on:
but you say, we ought not to imitate their cruelty. Would you then
have these famous Inhumans for your Friends and Allies? It would be
somewhat to the purpose, if, as they are vanquished, they would submit
to discretion, as many others have done before them; then we would
consult of it. And whatever we should leave them, the obligation would
be on their part, nor could the favours they received, pass for an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation.
And surely there is great difference 'twixt these two: For as
long as we make Treaties with them, they will violate them as before,
making it an occasion of Rupture, that the Conditions seem to them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just.
For pretences will not be wanting, when they have a mind to break:
But when they are submitted to discretion, that we have disarmed them,
and reduced their bodies under our obedience, they will learn that they
have nothing properly their own, and humbling themselves, will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with those things we shall leave them, as if they had never apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to them. If <hi>Scipio</hi> be of another judgement, you may examine
these two different opinions, and chuse the best; but if he be resolved
to make Peace with the Carthaginians without you, there is no necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of writing to him. For my part knowing well you are the Judges of
our Council, I have given mine as I believed it most advantagious for the
Commonwealth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After <hi>Lentulus</hi> had argued in this manner, the Senate put it to Voices,
where <hi>Scipio</hi> carried it by several Votes. Thus was a third Peace conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> of which <hi>Scipio</hi> was the principal cause,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65196:21"/>
whether for the reasons aforementioned, or because he thought it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
that the people of <hi>Rome</hi> had weakned <hi>Carthage</hi> to such a degree. For
there have been who affirmed, that to preserve the ancient discipline
among the Romans, he would have that City left yet in some condition,
least having nothing to fear, too great prosperity should make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent.
If this were <hi>Scipio</hi>'s thought he did not declare it, but <hi>Cato</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
after said the same thing in open Senate in a grave discourse he made
to the Fathers then incensed against the Rhodians.</p>
               <p>Peace being concluded, <hi>Scipio</hi> caused all the African Army to repass in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXX"/>
                  <hi>Italy,</hi> and entred the City in Triumph, but with greater Pomp then
ever any Captain had done. The manner of which I shall describe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the same used now adays. All the whole people were crowned, the
Trumpets marched before with the Chariots loaden with the Spoils of the
enemy, after which were born the figures of the Cities taken, and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
wherein were delineated, all the glorious acts done in that War,
then followed all the Silver as well coyned as in Ingots, and other preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
things, and then followed those Crowns had been given to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
by the Cities, by the Allies, or by his own Army; After all this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
white Oxen, then Elephants, and after them the Captive Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian
and Numidian Captains. Before the General marched the Ushers
in Purple Robes with a Chore of Musick, and Satyrs girt after the Tuscan
manner, having on their heads crowns of Gold, who advanced in order
singing and dancing. These Satyrs they called Ludions, by reason as I
imagine that the Tuscans wore formerly the Lydian habit; In the midst
of all these people was a certain man clad in a long purple Robe, adorned
with Bracelets and Chains of Gold, who with ridiculous postures derided
the enemies. After followed in train certain men with perfumes, and
next appeared the General mounted on a Chariot richly carved, he had
on his head a Crown of Gold set about with Precious Stones, his vesture
was a purple robe, and in one hand he bore an Ivory Scepter, and in the
other a branch of Laurel, which at <hi>Rome</hi> is the mark of victory. There
were in the same Chariot with him divers Children and Maidens, and on
Horses that drew it were mounted young men of his relations. All about
it marched the guards, the Secretaries and Esquires, who were followed
by the Soldiery, marching in order with abundance of Laurels, and those
who had done any eminent Service, wearing the military Recompenses
they had received. They have all free liberty in these occasions either to
praise their Captains; pass their jests upon them, or if they please to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
their actions, for a Triumph is a thing of absolute freedom, and
men are priviledged to say any thing. In this manner <hi>Scipio</hi> ascended the
Capitol, and the Pomp over, magnificently treated his Friends in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
according to custom.</p>
               <p>Such was the end of the second Punick War, which began in <hi>Spain,</hi> and
was finished in <hi>Africa</hi> by a Treaty concluded about that time, when the
Greeks account the hundred forty fourth Olympiad.</p>
               <p>Sometime after <hi>Masanissa</hi> (sworn Enemy to the Carthaginians) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXI"/>
siesed a part of their Territory, presuming as much on the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Romans, as any right he pretended to it, they sent deputies to
<hi>Rome</hi> to supplicate the Senate to put a stop to the Enterprizes of that
Prince: Commissioners were sent to determine the difference, but with
Orders to advance that Kings interests as high as they could possibly.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65196:22"/>
Thus <hi>Masanissa</hi> was maintained in the possession of what he had taken, and
made likewise a peace with the Carthaginians which lasted about fifty
years. During which, <hi>Carthage</hi> enjoying a solid peace, and being much
improved in men and riches by reason of the fruitfulness of the soil, and
commodiousness of the Harbors: The minds of men, as is usual, were
transported with prosperity, and the City was divided into three Factions
the Roman, the Popular, and the Royal. Each of which had for head the
most considerable men of the Nobility both for dignity and virtue. <hi>Hanno<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
the Great stood for the interest of the Romans: <hi>Hannibal Opsar</hi> sided
with <hi>Masanissa:</hi> And <hi>Amilcar</hi> called the Samnite, and with him <hi>Carthalon</hi>
were heads of the Popular Faction. These last seeing the Romans engaged
in a War in <hi>Celtiberia,</hi> and <hi>Masanissa</hi> hard put to it to defend himself
against other Spaniards, obliged <hi>Carthalon,</hi> who then in quality of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
General was going his Circuit, to fall at unawares upon <hi>Masanissa</hi>'s
Camp, then pitched in that Country, about which they had been at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference;
which he did, and having taken and slain some of the Kings
Troops raised the Country of <hi>Lybia</hi> against the Numidians. There fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
some other skirmishes between the two parties, till such time as the
Romans once more sent Commissioners to make Peace, with Orders like
the former to do secretly all they could in favor of the King. Who made
use of this cunning to confirm <hi>Masanissa</hi> in the possession of what he had
before siesed upon. They gave no sentence, nor took so much as any
cognizance of the difference, for fear lest <hi>Masanissa</hi> should seem to have
lost his cause, they only placed themselves between the two Camps, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, and gave order to both sides to lay down Arms. Some time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Masanissa</hi> renewed the War upon a pretence he had to a Country cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Lysoa,</hi> where there were large Champians, and fifty good Towns. The
Carthaginians had again recourse to the Senate, and people of <hi>Rome;</hi>
they promised to send Deputies upon the place to determine this affair, but
the Deputation was delay'd till such time as probable conjectures might
be made that <hi>Masanissa</hi> had the advantage. Then Commissioners were
dispatched, and among others <hi>Cato,</hi> who being arrived upon the places
contended for, required the parties to give them full power to judge the
difference as Arbitrators. To which <hi>Masanissa</hi> who found himself the
stronger, and confided in the Romans, easily agreed, but the Carthaginians
made a difficulty of it, and not without reason, for they remembred well
that in former sentences they had not done them justice, and alleged that
the accommodations made by the authority of <hi>Scipio</hi> needed no correctors,
provided they were observed by one Party and the other. Whereupon
the Commissioners who would not be Judges but by consent of parties, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
without doing any thing. But observing in their journy how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
the Land was cultivated, and that the Country abounded in all
things, they were astonished, especially to see <hi>Carthage</hi> it self so soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
of those losses so lately sustained by <hi>Scipio's</hi> Victory; Insomuch
that being returned to the City they declared it a fault in the people of
<hi>Rome,</hi> not to have a more watchful eye upon <hi>Carthage,</hi> they had so
anciently been jealous of, and which upon a sudden was so easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to such power. <hi>Cato</hi> himself said the Liberty of the people of
<hi>Rome</hi> could never be secured whilst <hi>Carthage</hi> subsisted. Which being
proposed in the Senate, it was resolved to make War upon the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians,
but that the design should be kept secret till opportunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented.
'Tis said that <hi>Cato</hi> hereafter ceased not in open Senate to declare
the Necessity of demolishing <hi>Carthage,</hi> but <hi>Scipio Nasica</hi> quite contrary
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65196:22"/>
argued that it was to be left in a condition, that the ancient Discipline,
which began to decay, might be maintained in vigor by the fear they would
still stand in of that City.</p>
               <p>Mean while in <hi>Carthage</hi> the Popular Faction suppressed the Royal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXII"/>
to banishment about fifty of the Principal, and making the
people swear never to admit their return, nor so much as suffer it to be
spoke of. The Exiles made their retreat to <hi>Masanissa</hi> to oblige him to a
War; He was before sufficiently inclined to it; wherefore he sent <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lussa</hi>
and <hi>Micipsa</hi> two of his sons to <hi>Carthage,</hi> to solicite the return of
those who had for his sake been banished. But when they presented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at the Gates. <hi>Carthalon</hi> forbid their entrance, for fear lest the
tears of the Exiles kindred should work upon the people, and besides
<hi>Amil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ar</hi> the Samnite laid an ambush for <hi>Gulussa</hi> upon his return which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lew some of his attendants and put him to flight. This gave occasion to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanissa</hi>
to besiege the City of <hi>Horoscopa,</hi> with the taking of which he had a
mighty desire to begin the rupture. To it's relief went the Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
with twenty five thousand Foot, and four thousand Horse of the City,
under the command of <hi>Asdrubal</hi> then General of their forces, to whom
joyned <hi>Assasis</hi> and <hi>Suba,</hi> two of <hi>Masanissa</hi>'s Major Generals who deserting
the two young Princes, went over to the Carthaginian party with six
thousand horse. <hi>Asdrubal</hi> with this additional force goes and encamps
near the King, and had often and successful skirmishes. But <hi>Masanissa</hi>
acting with the cunning of a Great Captain retired by little and little, as
if he had given ground, till such time as he had drawn him into a great
barren plain encompassed on all sides with Mountains, and deficient in
all necessaries to subsist on; Here facing the enemy he encamped in the
midst of the Plain, while <hi>Asdrubal</hi> siesed on the Eminencies, whereby he
thought he had the greater advantage. On the morrow the battel was
designed, when young <hi>Scipio</hi> who afterwards took <hi>Carthage,</hi> and who at
present was only Lieutenant to <hi>Lucullus,</hi> who made War in <hi>Celtiberia,</hi> came
to seek out <hi>Masanissa</hi> to demand some Elephants. The King who was desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
that day to take some repose that he might go the fresher to the battel
sent some horse to meet him, and gave orders to some of his sons to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him. Day being come he drew up his Army in battel being now
fourscore and eight years old, yet a strong and vigorous Souldier, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the custom of the Country mounted on horse back, without
saddle or other covering equally acting in the duty of General and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
for the Numidians are lustiest of all the people of <hi>Africa,</hi> and live
longer then any others, which is perhaps occasioned because the Winter
is not so sharp in this Country, nor the heats so violent as in <hi>India</hi>
and <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and for the same reasons are their Cattel stronger and
greater. The men lie all abroad and harden themselves by continual labor,
they drink little Wine, feed very sparingly and with much sobriety. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanissa</hi>
having drawn up his Army in Order, <hi>Asdrubal</hi> did the
like, for to him there were joyned many people of the Country.
<hi>Scipio</hi> being on the top of a Hill, as on a Theatre, saw all this Battel, and
was after heard to say, that though he had been in an infinite number of
fights, there was never any in which he took so much delight, for he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seen any other, wherein either his person was in security, or that
there were a hundred and ten thousand Combatants: Or to express it more
gloriously, he said that before him were never found but two Spectators in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65196:23"/>
a like occasion, which were in the time of the Trojan Wars, <hi>Iupiter</hi> on the
top of Mount <hi>Ida,</hi> and <hi>Neptune</hi> on <hi>Samothracia.</hi> They fought from
Morning till Night with great slaughter of men on both sides; however
the advantage seem'd <hi>Masanissa's:</hi> Whom <hi>Scipio</hi> came to meet, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to his Camp, congratulating the happy success of his Arms; and
for his part, he received <hi>Scipio</hi> as the Son of his Friend, with all possible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of kindness. The Carthaginians having notice of his coming,
requested him to make peace between <hi>Masanissa</hi> and them, which he
having yielded to, brought them to a Conference; the Articles of the
Treaty were, that the Carthaginians should release to the King all the
Country that lies about the Empories, and should promise him two
hundred Talents ready money, and eight hundred more payable at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
term: But when <hi>Masanissa,</hi> besides all this, demanded the Fugitives,
they would not hear him speak of it; so they parted without doing any
thing, and <hi>Scipio</hi> returned into <hi>Spain</hi> with the Elephants. <hi>Masanissa</hi> seeing
his Enemies Camp seated on an Eminence, or round Hill, besieged them in
such a manner, that no Provisions could be brought to them, nor was the
bringing all, there was none to be had, and he himself procured them
with much difficulty, and what he had was fetch'd from afar off, and in
very small quantities. <hi>Asdrubal</hi> at first thought that with the Forces he
had, he could disingage himself when he pleased, and open himself a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
through the midst of his Enemies. But because his Stores were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
furnish'd than theirs, he hoped <hi>Masanissa</hi> might be reduced to a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of demanding Peace; and besides, he was the less concerned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had heard that Deputies were coming from <hi>Rome</hi> to end their
differences. This was true, but these Deputies had Orders to determine
the Affairs, if <hi>Masanissa</hi> was overcharged, but to highten his courage, if
they found<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> him the stronger, which Orders they punctually executed.
Mean while the Famine entred <hi>Asdrubal's</hi> Camp in such manner, that the
Soldiers weaken'd with Hunger, were not able to repulse the Enemy; first
they kill'd the Beasts of carriage, after that their Horses for service; and
at last were reduced to such extreme necessity, that they boiled the very
Reins of the Bridles for a sustenance. There supprised them likewise an
infinite number of Diseases, increased by their bad Food, by the idleness
of the Soldiers, and the season of the year, for there was a great number of
men inclosed within a small compass of ground, during the greatest heats
of Summer, which were excessive in <hi>Africa:</hi> And because through the
want of Wood, even to dress their Food, they had been forced to burn their
very Bucklers: Now not having the means to carry their dead Bodies out
of the Camp, because of the strict Guard <hi>Masanissa</hi> kept, and destitute
of Fuel to burn them, the Plague daily increased with the stink of the dead
Carcases, in the midst of which they were forced to abide. Hunger had
already consumed the greatest part, when the rest hopeless of safety were
forced to deliver up the Fugitives to <hi>Masanissa,</hi> to oblige themselves to
pay him yearly five thousand Talents of Silver for fifty years, and to cause
those they had banished to return, notwithstanding their Oath to the
contrary. It was likewise agreed, that the Soldiers which remained should
march out only with one Coat, and pass under the Yoke: Which being
executed, <hi>Gulussa</hi> remembring how a little before he had been affronted,
sent the Numidian Horse after the Carthaginians, who not able to make
resistance, disarmed, as they were, and not having strength enough to
fly; of fifty eight thousand men very few recovered <hi>Carthage,</hi> of which
number was <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> with some of the Nobility. This is what passed in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65196:23"/>
the War, between <hi>Masanissa</hi> and the Carthagians, which was soon after
followed by the third and last Punick War.</p>
               <p>The people of <hi>Carthage</hi> weakned by the losses they had sustained in
this War,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXIII"/>
stood yet in fear of <hi>Masanissa,</hi> who was nigh with a great
Army; and besides doubted not but the Romans, who had testified their
disaffection to them upon all occasions, would lay hold of this, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that the Carthaginians had made War upon <hi>Masanissa,</hi> the Friend
and Ally of the Roman people. And indeed their conjecture was not false;
for as soon as it was known at <hi>Rome</hi> what had passed, the Senate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
all the people of <hi>Italy</hi> to levy great numbers of Soldiers; not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
for what service they designed them; but only giving Orders
they should be in a readiness upon the first Command. Wherefore the
Carthaginians to repair their fault, did by publick Edict declare <hi>Asdrubal</hi>
their General against <hi>Masanissa,</hi> criminal, together with <hi>Carthalon</hi> his
Lieutenant, and all those of their Faction, laying to their charge the cause
of this War. They likewise sent them Deputies to <hi>Rome</hi> to complain of
<hi>Masanissa,</hi> but more of their own Citizens already condemned, for that
they had rashly, and with too much passion taken Arms against that King,
and by that means put the City into hazard of falling afresh into evil
terms with the people of <hi>Rome.</hi> Upon which a certain Senator asked
them, why they had not, in the beginning of the War, condemned all those
were the cause of it, without attending the ill success of the enterprize;
adding that the Carthaginians had a long time designed a War against the
people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and went only seeking an opportunity, wherefore the
Senate could not receive this excuse. The Deputies surprized with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
demanded in return what then they should do to expiate their crime,
since they had adjudged them guilty: to which was replyed in a word,
<hi>Content the people of</hi> Rome. It was brought into debate in the Senate of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> what this Contentment could be, they desired of them, some
thinking that the Romans would have some sums added to those ordained
by <hi>Scipio,</hi> others that they must absolutely quit to <hi>Masanissa</hi> the possession of
those Lands in difference. In this uncertainty they sent once more to beseech
the Senate to prescribe them more expresly the means of contenting them;
to which answer was given, <hi>the Carthaginians knew them well enough;</hi> and
with this they were sent back: which begat a strange trouble, and general
terrour throughout all <hi>Carthage.</hi> And to add to it, at the same time, the
City of <hi>Utica,</hi> then the most considerable of all <hi>Africa,</hi> next to <hi>Carthage,</hi>
having large and commodious Havens to receive a forreign Fleet, and not
above sixty furlongs distant from that City, and so by consequence very
proper to make the seat of the War against the Carthaginians; there
having ever been a secret animosity between the two Cities: <hi>Utica</hi> taking
this opportunity of the deplorable Estate, to which <hi>Carthage</hi> was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
sends Deputies to <hi>Rome</hi> to yield up themselves and their City to
the Roman people. The Senate, who had long before had an inclination
to this War, and were now prepared for it, having at their devotion so
strong and so commodious a City, discovered their intentions, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
in the Capitol, where it is usual to debate Affairs of consequence,
decreed a VVar with <hi>Carthage;</hi> and at the same time gave it in Order
to the Consuls, with private Orders, never to give it over till <hi>Carthage</hi> were
destroy'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. Manlius</hi> had the command of the Army by Land, and <hi>L. Marcinus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXIV"/>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:65196:24"/>
Censorinus</hi> of the Fleet by Sea. After offering up the usual Sacrifices, they
past into <hi>Sicily,</hi> that from thence they might set forward to <hi>Utica,</hi> carryed
by fifty<note n="*" place="margin">Galleys of five ranks to a bank.</note> Quinqueremes, and a hundred Foists followed by many others,
as well flat bottom'd Vessels, as great Barques and Ships of Burthen: Their
Army consisted of fourscore thousand Foot, and about four thousand cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
Horse. For both the Citizens and Allies manifested an equal ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity
to go upon this glorious expedition, the success of which was no way
doubtful; nay, some were found that would engage in it, whether the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
would or no. Thus was War made and declared against <hi>Carthage</hi> at
the same time, and he that carried them the Decree of the Senate, declared
likewise that there was an Army at Sea ready to invade them. This news
cast the whole City, not only into fear, but despair. They had lately lost
all their Youth, they had neither Fleet, nor Allies, nor Soldiers in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
no provision in the City to sustain a Siege; in short, no manner of
preparations, as ordinarily happen to people surprized, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
War, and which has not been declared. Besides, it was not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for them to oppose the Romans and <hi>Masanissa</hi> together; wherefore they
sent other Deputies to <hi>Rome,</hi> with full authority to accommodate the Affair
at any rate whatsoever. The Senate made them answer, That, provided
the Army were yet in <hi>Sicily,</hi> if within a month the Carthaginians would
deliver up in Hostage three hundred Children of their best Families, and
perform what they should ordain, the City of <hi>Carthage</hi> should remain free
in the enjoyment of their Rights, and of the Territory they possessed in
<hi>Africa.</hi> This Decree of the Senate they publickly gave to the Deputies
to carry to the Consuls, whom privately they advertised not to recede
from those orders they had received in the City. The Carthaginians
were doubtful, that though they did deliver up their Hostages, they should
not obtain assured Peace. However, in the extremity wherein they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
themselves, they placed all their hopes in obedience; and that they
might work upon the Consuls, by a ready execution of their commands,
they carried their Children into <hi>Sicily,</hi> before the time had been prescribed
them. It's true, that their Parents and Friends parted not from them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
abundance of tears; especially the Mothers, who ecchoing fearful
shrieks and crys, could hardly be pulled from the embraces of their
Children, and when they were, hung upon the Ships, clasped hold upon
the Anchors, and cut the Tackle to hinder the Seamen from putting forth;
many tore their hair, and beat their breasts, as if they had been at a Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
for they perceived that in appearance indeed they gave Hostages,
but in reality and effect, they yielded up their City, since their Children
were taken away, and no assured promise made them. And indeed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of these Women shedding tears made this dire prediction, that the
giving Hostages was but in vain. Thus were these Youth taken away
from <hi>Carthage,</hi> to be delivered up in <hi>Sicily,</hi> where they were received by
the Consuls, who sent them to <hi>Rome,</hi> and told the Carthaginians, they
should know at <hi>Utica,</hi> what more was to be done, to deliver themselves
from this VVar.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXIV"/>
                  <hi>VVhen the Romans were passed over, the Army encamped in the same
place, <hi>Scipio</hi> had before encamped in, and the Fleet rode in the Ports de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on <hi>Utica.</hi> The Carthaginian Deputies came to attend the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls,
who seated in the Tribunal, encompassed by all the Officers of the
Army, had caused to be drawn off on both sides the way that the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians
were to pass, all their Forces magnificently armed, with Colours
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65196:24"/>
flying, that the Carthaginians might judge of their vast numbers by what
they saw. Then a Trumpet having commanded silence, by the Consuls or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Herauld went to give notice to the Deputies, that they were ready
to give them audience. They were led through the midst of all the Army,
and when they drew near, stopt at the Rails, placed like a Bar before the
Tribunal, from whence the Consuls commanded them to make their
Proposals.</hi> They began then in a deplorable manner to recount the ancient
Treaties had been between the two people, the antiquity of <hi>Carthage,</hi> the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of people in it, the power they had had, and the former great extent of
their Dominions; adding that they spoke not this out of vanity (for it was no
time to be vain, when they were miserable) but to the end, that the Example
of a change so great and so sudden, might oblige the Romans to treat them
with humanity and moderation, of which they could not give any more illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
evidence, than by having commiseration of the afflicted, besides those who
exercise their power well in other mens misfortunes, may hope the like from their
Conquerours, if they should fall into the same disgrace. It would be piety in
you <hi>(said the Chief of the Deputies)</hi> to consider the miserable condition of our
affairs, and unless we have indeed met with Enemies pitiless and inexorable,
you should in all reason rest satisfied with our calamities; we have lost all the
Dominion we had both by Sea and Land, we have delivered up our Ships to
you, and have not sought to build others; we have forborn hunting of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants;
we have both formerly, and at present, delivered you good Hostages.
We have paid you the Tribute we ought you at the time limited, we that use to
receive from others. Certainly, Sirs, your Predecessors, after having van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
us, contented themselves with thus much, they received us into their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
and friendship, on these conditions, which we have solemnly sworn to
maintain on one part and the other. They faithfully kept the Peace they grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
after long Wars; and you, against whom we never took up Arms, what is it
you complain of? what part of the Treaty has not been observed, that you so
suddenly decreed this War, and bring it to our doors before you declare it? Have
we not paid you your Tribute? have we any Ships? have we any Elephants?
Do we not seem worthy of your compassion, after the so late loss of fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men by famine? You will say we made War upon <hi>Masanissa:</hi> 'Tis true,
but 'twas not till he had usurped our Lands, which we for a long time suffered
with patience, till he setting no bounds to his avarice, committed a thousand cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
in the Country about the Empories, where he was brought up and educated;
and not content with that, he has attempted to snatch from us what we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining,
and at last has gone so far, as to trouble the peace we had with you:
But because we feared to displease you, that we might remove all pretence of
making this War, we have by publick Edict declared even our own Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
Criminal; we have sent Deputies to <hi>Rome</hi> to make our excuses, and now
again afresh sent other Deputies with full Authority to renew the Peace, on
what conditions soever you should think fit: What need was there then of this
Fleet, or this Army against people, who though innocent, submit themselves to
whatsoever you shall ordain? You may easily judge we make not these offers to
deceive you, and that you cannot impose upon us any penalty, we will not
undergo, whilst we have surrendred up as Hostages to you, the most considerable
of our Children, as you desired, without staying out the months time you gave
us for the sending them: Besides, the Decree of the Senate declares, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
we delivered those Hostages, <hi>Carthage</hi> should remain free in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of what we possess.</p>
               <p>After the Deputy had thus spoken, <hi>Censorinus</hi> broke silence, and answered
him in these terms. <hi>'Tis needless to repeat to you the occasion of this War,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65196:25"/>
your Deputies have already heard it from the Senate themselves. But as to
what you falsely object to us 'twill be easie to reply; for it is decreed by the
Ordinance you speak of, and we told it you before in <hi>Sicily,</hi> when we received
your Hostages, that at <hi>Utica</hi> should be proposed to you the farther intentions
of the Senate. We cannot but praise you that you have sent your Hostages
so readily and such chosen ones. But if you so passionately desire Peace, what
need have you of Arms. Wherefore bring all you have as well belonging
to the publick, as private persons, all your Darts, Crossbows and other Arms,
and deliver them into our hands.</hi> The Deputies answered that they were
willing to obey in this too, but then they could not tell how to hinder
<hi>Asdrubal's</hi> entry into the City, whom they had condemned to death, and
who was now at the head of twenty thousand men which he had new rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
However when the Consuls had replied that the Senate and people
of <hi>Rome</hi> would take that into their care, they promised to surrender their
Arms, and <hi>Scipio Nasica,</hi> and <hi>Cn. Cornelius Hispalus</hi> were sent to receive
them. They had Arms for two hundred thousand men, an infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of piles and darts, two thousand as well crossbows as other engins,
for the lancing of javelins and casting of great stones. And it was a
wonderful thing to see the carriages loaden with them conducted by the
enemies themselves, who were followed by the Deputies, Senators, Officers,
Priests and Nobility, hoping to move the Consuls either out of respect to
their dignity or out of compassion to their misfortune.</p>
               <p>When they were come before the Tribunal, each man habited accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their degree, they all stood attentive, and <hi>Censorinus</hi> who was more
eloquent then his colleague once more breaking silence spoke to them in
this manner. <hi>Certainly we have good reason to applaud that ready obedience
you have manifested in delivering your Hostages, and surrendring up your
Arms; but it is fruitless to make long discourses where necessity presses.
Hearken with patience to the remaining Orders of the Senate; withdraw your
selves from the City of <hi>Carthage</hi> and transfer your habitation into whatever
place you please of your Dominion, provided it be fourscore furlongs from the
Sea, for we are resolved to rase it.</hi> The Consuls words were interrupted
by the outcrys of the Carthaginians, who began to lift up their hands to
heaven, calling the gods to witness of the treaties violated, railing, reviling
and reproaching the Romans. Some desired death, others became furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
some provoked the Romans against the Deputies, others cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
on the ground, beating the pavement with their hands and face, and
others in a rage tore not only their cloaths but their very flesh, but after
this first agitation was past over, you might behold them overwhelmed
with sorrow, standing still without speaking a word, as if they had been
dead. The Romans were astonished at the spectacle, and the Consuls
could not take it ill that this consternation, caused by an unexpected com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
had raised such storms in the brests of the Carthaginians, till their
heat of anger was over, for they considered that mighty calamities do on
the sudden create a boldness in the heart of men, who cannot upon surprise
digest the troublesome necessity of obeying, and becoming hereafter ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants:
but when after a long silence they grew more lively sensible of
their misery, they forbore any farther revilings, and only set themselves to
lament their unfortunate condition, calling by name, their Children, their
Wives and their Country, as if they had heard their lamentations. The
Priests likewise invoked the Gods as if they had been present, reproaching
them with being the cause of their death. In short the mourning was so
great, and the groans so confused, of those who deplored the publick and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65196:25"/>
private misfortune, and so worthy of compassion, that they drew tears
from the eyes of their enemies. The Consuls themselves moved with
pity, out of a consideration of the instability of humane things, expected
with sad countenances the end of their deplorings, when after abundance
of tears and groans, the Calm in some sort returning into their souls,
they fell again into a profound silence, and considering that their City was
disarmed and defenceless, that they had not one Ship, one Warlike
Engine, one Dart, or one Sword left, that they had not within their
walls men of war sufficient, having lately lost fifty thousand men, and that
it was not possible for them to raise Soldiers elsewhere, having neither
friends nor allies, besides that the shortness of the time would not permit
it. That their Children, their Friends, and their Country were in the
enemies power, their City besieged by Sea and Land, and that from the
other side <hi>Masanissa</hi> their ancient enemy was ready to fall upon them,
they put a stop to the Tumult, and extravagance, as of all things most
useless in this occasion, and had a fresh recourse to prayers. Then
<hi>Hanno</hi> surnamed <hi>Gilla</hi> the most considerable of all the Carthaginians
there present, having first obatined permission to speak, began in this
manner.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Sirs, If I may be admitted to add any thing to the Remonstrances <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXVI"/>
we have made you, I must tell you, that we pretend not to act in this
occasion, as if we pleaded our cause before you in quality of Judges;
such proceeding is utterly unseasonable in our present condition; but I
hope to make it appear by pertinent reasons, that we are not unworthy
your mercy. We who have formerly been Lords of <hi>Africa,</hi> both by
Sea and Land, and for a long time disputed Extent of Empire with you,
at last yielded all to <hi>Scipio,</hi> when we delivered up all our Ships and our
Elephants, we have likewise payd you the tributes imposed on us at
the terms prescribed. We beg you therefore, by those gods, witnesses
to the treaty, to pardon us, and not to violate the Oath of <hi>Scipio,</hi> who
swore that from thence forward the people of <hi>Carthage</hi> should be friend
and allie to the people of <hi>Rome.</hi> We have not swerved from any thing
of that accommodation. We have neither ships, nor Elephants, you
can demand no tribute of us, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay we have served you against three
Kings, and be not offended if we put you in mind of it, when you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
our Arms, since ordinarily miseries make men speak more then
they ought; but now though the Religion of the Treaty should be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
argument to perswade you, we have only recourse to our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and indeed we have nothing else left, having already yielded up to
you all that was in our power. This is all I can say to you touching the
first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Treaty of Peace which was ratified by the Oath of <hi>Scipio</hi> your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
but for what concerns our present Estate, you Sirs, are your selves
witnesses of what we have done. You demanded Hostages, we have
given you all the choicest of our youth. You desired our Arms, we
have surrendred them all, which the inhabitants of a City taken never
willingly did. We assured our selves upon the honesty of the Romans
and upon their word, for the Senate gave us their letters, which we
delivered unto you, and when you demanded Hostages from us, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
that <hi>Carthage</hi> should (giving them) be at liberty to live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to its Laws. And if having done what the letters of the Senate
have ordered us, nay more than what they commanded, it would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
appear very evil if after having promised liberty to our City,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65196:26"/>
upon delivery of Hostages, you should ordain it's destruction, after having
received them, for if you demolish it, how can you leave it free as you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.
This is all we have to say touching the Treaties, as well old as new,
and if this move you not, we will only have recourse to prayers and tears,
the sole refuge of the miserable, and for which we have ample occasion in
the innumerable calamities that overwhelm us. We beseech you therefore
for an antient City, built by the command of the Gods. For the support of
that immense glory it had acquired. For the preservation of that name
it has born throughout the whole world, for its Temples, for its Gods,
which are not capable of any crime. Chastise not them by a privation
of those solemn sacrifices and continual adorations paid them by this
City. Rob not the dead, who never offended you, of their Sepulchres,
and those funeral Honors daily celebrated on their tombs. And if you
have any pity for us, since you say 'tis out of compassion you permit us
to chuse another habitation, spare our Altars, spare our houshold gods,
spare our high places, spare the goddess guardian of <hi>Carthage.</hi> In short
spare so many things that are both pleasant and precious in the eyes of
the whole earth; for what can you fear from us? You have our ships,
you have our arms, and all those great beasts which attracted on us
the envy of such a world of people. You may say perhaps that it is
comfort enough for us, that you suffer us to build another City. But it
is impossible for men accustomed to get their livelyhood from the Sea, of
whom we have an infinite number, to live or subsist in the Inland, yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you will have this to be a favor, but pray be pleased that instead
of it we offer you another condition which will fully satisfie us and (in
our opinion) bring you more glory. Let the City that has not sinn'd
stand, and put to death all the Carthaginians rather then command them
to change habitation. Thus all the world will believe you animated
against men, and not against Temples, Gods, Sepulchres and innocent
walls. You have been accustomed to prefer glory and pitty before all
things, and to make your moderation shine in the midst of your prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
which hitherto you have practised towards all you have subdued,
suffer your selves then to be moved by the prayers of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and those
gods which yet preside ore <hi>Carthage,</hi> and for their sake cease to hate us
and our children, out of a remembrance of our past offences. Take
heed lest we prove the first for whom you loose that high esteem in
which you live, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ully not your reputation by the cruelty of this
action, so horrible to speak of, much more to act, and of which never
yet was heard an Example. The Greeks made many Wars upon the
Barbarians, and you your selves have bore Arms against many other
Nations; yet neither of you ever raz'd a City that yielded without fight,
that had delivered up all they held most dear, their Children and their
Arms, and are moreover ready to submit to whatever other punishment
should be imposed, We therefore implore you by those gods, witnesses
to our treaties, by the fortune of mankind, by those inward stings, they
who are in prosperity ought to feel and fear, not to brand your success
with so shameful a tyranny, nor extend our miseries to the utmost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities.
Or if for your parts you are resolved, yet give us leave to
send once more to <hi>Rome,</hi> to present our request to the Senate. 'Tis
but a short time we ask you, yet during which our torment and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
will increase through the incertainty of the event. You are in ample
power to do with us what you please either at present or afterwards but
pray remember to act nothing contrary to Piety and Mercy.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:65196:26"/>
To all this <hi>Censorinus</hi> replyed; <q>There needs no farther repetition of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXVIII"/>
Orders of the Senate, they have ordained, and it must be done, did we
treat you like Enemies, we should only command, and then force you
to it; but because the interest of our Commonwealth, and possible the
advantage of your own requires it; I am content to make you apprehend
the reasons, and to perswade rather than constrain you. As often as
the sight of the Sea puts you in remembrance of your ancient Dominion,
and past Greatness, it provokes your Arms, and begets you a thousand
calamities. 'Twas this Sea gave the first occasion of your Assaults on
<hi>Sicily,</hi> which since you have lost. 'Twas this Sea which made you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
<hi>Spain,</hi> out of which you were soon after chased. 'Twas this Sea
gave you the opportunity of robbing our Merchants, contrary to your
faith given in our Leagues, and then to throw them over-board, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to conceal your crimes, till being surprised in it, you quitted <hi>Sardinia</hi>
for reparation of that injury. Thus you lost <hi>Sardinia</hi> by means of that
Sea which by its nature inclines all the world to covetousness, by reason
of the yast profit it brings in, in a little time. By it formerly the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
skilful in Maritime Affairs, grew suddenly and mightily great;
and by it were not long after as suddenly ruined; for the Sea is a kind of
Merchandise by which riches flow in full springs, and suddenly ebbs as
fast. You know well that those people I am speaking of, having extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Dominion over all the Ionian Sea, and even unto <hi>Sicily,</hi> set no
bounds to their avarice till they had lost all, till they were forced to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
their Havens and their Ships into their Enemies hands, to receive
a Garrison into their City, and demolish with their own hands their lofty
Walls, so that they became almost a Plain, which for a long time proved
the means of their preservation. And surely, Gentlemen of <hi>Carthage,</hi>
there is more stability in a Country Life, and more assurance in Labour
and Tillage; and though the profits are not so great as those reaped by
the Sea, yet are they much more certain: and to tell you my thoughts,
I am clearly of opinion, that a Maritime City is rather a Ship, than firm
Land, so much is it tossed with variety of affairs, and subject to infinite
Revolutions, whilst the Inland yields Fruits, may be gathered without
danger; for this reason was it, that anciently Kings chose their Seats
within Land, and that was it raised the Medes, Persians, Assyrians and
many others to such a height of power; but to what purpose give I you
the examples of Kings, let us speak of what concerns you. Cast your eyes
throughout all <hi>Lybia,</hi> and chuse your selves a place where you may have
Neighbours that you like, but whence you may no more see this object
that at present tempts you. Thus you will rase out of your minds
the memory of past miseries; and indeed how can you look upon the
Sea, where now you have no Shipping without being tormented with
the remembrance of those mighty Fleets which daily returned to your
Ports loaden with booty or with the thoughts of the former
Magnificence of your Ports, your Arsenals and your Havens. And
when within your City you behold the Lodgings of the Soldiers unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
your Stables without Horses, and your Stalls without Elephants:
what can all this move you to, but grief, and desire to recover, if it
were possible, the same power. 'Tis ordinary among men, that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of past felicity creates a hope of its return; and on the contrary,
there is no better remedy against calamity than oblivion, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be attained to, but by distancing our selves from objects may keep it
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65196:27"/>
fresh in our minds. An evident proof of this you may have in your
selves, who after having sundry times obtained pardon for your faults,
could never keep to constant Peace, nor continue long without violation
of your Treaties. Wherefore if you have still thoughts of Dominion,
and that preserving your animosities against us, you wait only a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
opportunity to shake off the yoke, you do well in endeavouring
still to maintain your City, your Ports, your Honours, and those lofty
Walls which seem only built for War: and we on our side should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a great crime to pardon people that will not pardon us, even
then when fortune has submitted them to our power. But if in truth,
and not in word only you yield the Dominion to us, and that content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your selves with what you possess in <hi>Lybia,</hi> you will make a sincere
peace with us, deal faithfully, and prove it by the effects, retire your
selves into <hi>Africa,</hi> and willingly yield up to us that Empire of the Sea,
which by right of War belongs to us. In vain, to move us to compassion,
do you deplore your Temples, your Gods, your publick Places, and
your Sepulchres; for we will not touch your Sepulchres, and you shall
have liberty when you please to come and sacrifice, but all the rest must
be demolished; for you sacrifice not to Havens, nor pay Funeral Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
to Walls; for your Hearths, your Altars, and publick Places, you
may build them elsewhere, and soon establish your selves a Residence
in the same manner as when you left <hi>Tyre</hi> you came into <hi>Africa,</hi> and
gained this Seat which now you call the Seat of your Ancestors. To tell
you all in a word, you may easily conceive what we now do is not out
of malice, but for our own security, and to maintain publick concord:
if you remember that <hi>Alba</hi> which was no Enemy City, inhabited not
by Foes, but Friends that loved us, was transferred into our City for
the publick good, which succeded to both peoples satisfaction. But we
have, say you, multitudes of miserable people who gain their living by
the Sea; this hath likewise been thought on, so far, that it will be easie
for you still to trade by Sea, and to import and export your Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
without very great trouble; for we have not ordained your retreat
from the Sea above fourscore Furlongs; and we our selves are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
at least a hundred. We permit you to chuse such a place as shall
best like you, and live with all freedom in your new Habitations: and
this is what we meant when we told you that the City of <hi>Carthage</hi> should
remain free, if they obeyed us in this occasion; for speaking of the
City, we believed not to be understood to have spoken of its Foundations,
or its Walls, but its Citizens.</q> Here <hi>Censorinus</hi> stopped, but seeing the
Carthaginians were likewise silent, he added, that <hi>What he had said, was
only to perswade and comfort them: And now,</hi> said he, <hi>the Orders of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
must be put in execution, and that out of hand, wherefore withdraw your
selves; for as yet we consider you as Deputies.</hi> Upon hearing these words,
the Ushers made them go forth; but they foreseeing the disorder this news
would bring to <hi>Carthage,</hi> desired once more audience, and being again ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
spake again in this manner. <hi>We see well, that we must obey, since
you will not permit us to send to</hi> Rome; <hi>nor have we any hopes of ever return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
again to you; for our Citizens, before we shall have done speaking, will tear
us in pieces; wherefore we beg you not for our concern (we have already set up
our Rest) but for the interest of</hi> Carthage, <hi>to oblige them by terror to support
the Calamity they groan under, that to that end you would cause your Fleet to
approach the City, whilst we are on the way thither, to the intent, that they at
once understanding your design, and seeing the danger whereupon they are
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65196:27"/>
threatened, falling upon them, may suffer, if possible, the execution of your
Command. Iudge you to what the injustice of our fortune has reduced us, when
we are constrained to demand your Forces against our selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having uttered these words, they departed, and <hi>Censorinus</hi> went to
plant himself within view of <hi>Carthage</hi> with twenty Galleys, whilst one
part of the Deputies took a quite different way from the City, and the rest
went thitherward quite overwhelmed with sorrow and grief.</p>
               <p>The Carthaginians stood upon their Walls to discover their return at a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXIX"/>
distance; and some tore their hairs out of impatience to see them coming,
others ran out to meet them to hear the news; but when they beheld them
quite cast down with sadness, they smote their Brests, demanding how
things had passed; some in the general; others when they met a Friend or
any one they knew, stopped them and enquired: but when they received
no answer, they gave themselves over to tears, judging all was lost, those
who from the Walls perceived it, wept likewise for company, without
knowing wherefore, but out of an inward presage of some great misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
The Deputies being come to the Gate, the people thronged so thick,
that they were ready to stifle one another, and ready they were to have
torn in pieces the Deputies, had they not told them that before they could
answer them they must have conference with the Senate. Hereupon some
gave place, and others made way for them, that they might the sooner
know the truth. After they were entred the Palace, and the multitude
were retired, the Senate took their Seats, and the people stood all about
the Senate-House. And now the Deputies having told them the command
they had received from the Consuls, there was raised a confused cry in the
Assembly, which the people that were without answered by a dreadful
noise. But when the Deputies continued their discourse, and declared the
reasons they had used to move the Romans, they again kept a profound si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
out of the desire every man had to know the event, which made the
people quiet too; but when they understood that they were not suffered
so much as to send to <hi>Rome,</hi> they burst forth into hideous groans and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries;
and the people forcing their Guards, entred confusedly into the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
where now there was nothing but rage and fury. All the Rabble, like
so many <hi>Bacchantes,</hi> possessed with different sorts of madness, fell some up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Senators who had advised the giving of Hostages, tearing them in
pieces, as if they had been the first cause of their surprise; others treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the same manner those who had counselled the delivery of their Arms:
some threw Stones at the Deputies, as the bringers of ill news; others ran
like Furies up and down the Streets, and finding some <hi>Italians,</hi> who by
chance had staid in the City, not dreaming of this unexpected misfortune,
treated them with a thousand sorts of Indignities, telling them they would
have revenge for the Hostages sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and for the Arms taken from
them. All the City was filled with tears and rage, with fear and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings;
some running through the Streets called out to their Friends, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ran to the Temples, blaspheming the Gods that had not power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their own Altars, some running to the Arsenals, wept for grief, to
see them empty, others running to the Havens with tears, bemoaned their
Ships delivered to faithless men, others again called their Elephants by
name, as if they had still been with them, accusing and blaming both
themselves and their Predecessors, and arguing that they ought never to
have yielded up neither Elephants, nor Ships, nor Arms, nor consented to
pay Tribute; for that it had been much more honourable to have died for
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65196:28"/>
their Country with their Arms in their hands. But nothing more enflamed
the anger of the people, than the Mothers of the Hostages, whom they
might behold like Furies in a Tragedy, flie upon all they met with, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them that they had robbed them of their Children, and demanding satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
In conclusion, some more reserved than the rest, after having
barricadoed up the Gates, gathered Stones, and carried them upon the
Walls, to serve against the Enemy, instead of other Arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XL"/> The same day it was concluded in the Senate, that they should stand upon
their Defence, and Proclamation was made for the general freedom of Slaves.
They likewise nominated Generals, of which one was <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> whom
they had condemned to death, and who had already twenty thousand Men
in Arms, and to him they presently dispatched a Deputy to entreat him, that
now in his Countries extremity he would not remember the offence he had
received, which was only occasioned by the fear they had of the Romans.
Him they appointed to keep the Field; and for the City they chose another
<hi>Asdrubal,</hi> Grand-child to <hi>Masanissa,</hi> by one of his Daughters. This done,
they dispatched once more to the Consuls, to demand only thirty days time,
during which, their Deputies should go to <hi>Rome,</hi> which being refused, they
took a resolution to suffer all extremities, rather than abandon their City.
And now might be seen an universal change in mens minds; the Temples like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and the Palace, and other spacious places were changed into publick
Shops, wherein men and women laboured night and day without respit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
so much time as necessity and nature required for food and sleep; so that
every day they made one hundred Bucklers, three hundred Swords, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Arrows for the Cross-bow; five hundred Darts and Javelins, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Cross-bows as they could; and when they wanted strings to bend them
with, the Women cut off their Hair to make Cords of. Whilst the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians
prepared for War with so much care and diligence, the Consuls were
not so pressing, whether it troubled them to resolve upon doing a thing so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
or that they thought they could, when ever they pleased, with
ease take by force a disarmed City. Besides they imagined that necessity
would soon take them off their courage, it being ordinary, that those who
in the extremity of Affairs are at first furiously opposite, after having more
closely considered the matter, grow fearful of displeasing those who have the
power of destroying them, which happened in effect in <hi>Carthage,</hi> where a
certain man perceiving his Fellow-Citizens already growing sensible of fear,
came into the Assembly under another pretence, and told them, that of many
evils the least was to be chosen, when they had not wherewithal to defend
themselves. Mean while <hi>Masanissa</hi> was not well satisfied, that he having
brought down the Power and Glory of the Carthaginians, the Romans
should come and snatch the Victory out of his hands, and had crossed the
Sea without first communicating their design to him, which they had used
to do in former Wars. However, when the Consuls, to sound his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
demanded his assistance, he replyed, he would not be wanting, as soon
as he knew they stood in need of it, and indeed sometime after he sent one
to the Confuls, to know if they had any thing for him to do, but they not
enduring his Pride, and mistrusting him as a person grown angry, made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that when they stood in need of him, they would send him word, and
yet were they at present in some straits for Provisions, which were only
brought them from <hi>Adrumetum, Leptis, Saxa, Utica</hi> and <hi>Chella;</hi> for <hi>Asdrubal</hi>
held all the rest of <hi>Lybia,</hi> from whence he sent what he could to <hi>Carthage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some days being passed, the two Consuls drew their Army near the City,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65196:28"/>
resolved to besiege it. It was situate in the great Golf of <hi>Africa,</hi> encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
by the Sea, in form of a Peninsula, the Neck of which dividing it
from the Continent, was about five and twenty Furlongs broad. Towards
the West there stretched out a long Point of Land, about half a Furlong
wide, which advancing into the Sea, divided it from the Marish, and
was inclosed on all sides with Rocks, and with a single Wall. Towards
the South and the Continent, where stood the Cittadal called <hi>Byrsa,</hi> it
was inclosed with a triple Wall of thirty Cubits high, not accounting the
height of the Parapets and Towers, which flanked it round in equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
of about two<note n="*" place="margin">Or about 80 fathoms, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Greek Acre:</note> Acres one from another. Their Foundations were
about thirty Foot deep, and they were four Stories high, the Walls reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only to the second, but they were vaulted, and that so vastly, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derground
there were Stalls for three hundred Elephants, with all things
necessary for their sustenance, and above Stables for four thousand Horse,
and Lofts for their Provender: besides there were Lodgings for twenty
thousand Footmen, and four thousand Horsemen; in short, all their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
preparations for War were lodged in their Walls only. There
was but one place of the City, where the Walls were low and weak. This
was a neglected Angle, which began at the Point of Land, we spoke of
before, and reached to the Ports, for they had two Ports disposed in such
manner, that a Ship might easily go from one to the other; and yet there
was but one entrance through a passage of about sixty six Foot wide, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
with Chains; the first was for Merchants, where were many, and
divers sorts of Quarters for the Mariners; the other, which was the inner
Port, was for the Men of War, in the midst of which stood an Island encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
about, as well as the Port, with vast Keys, in which there were Places
or Docks to put under covert two hundred and twenty Ships, and above
Store-houses, where they wrought and made all things necessary for the
Shipping; the Fronts of each place were upheld by two Pillars of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Ionick workmanship, so that the whole round, as well of the Port
as the Island, represented on both sides two magnificent Gallies. Within
this Island stood the Admirals Palace, from whence the Trumpet gave
the Signal of his Orders; from whence he published his Ordinances, and
from whence he overlooked all things. The Island stood directly opposite
to the mouth of the Port, extending it self a good way forward, so that
from thence the Admiral could discern what passed at Sea a great distance
off, but those at Sea could not perceive what passed within; nay, when
the Merchants were entred into their Port, they could not see the Men of
War, for their Port was separate from the inward Port by a double Wall,
and for them there was an entrance from their Port by a Gate into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
without passing into the other. Such was at this time the face of <hi>Carthage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Consuls having each taken their quarter, began their assaults, <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
to the Landside, with design to fill up the Ditch, and possess himself
of the Rampire within it, that so he might afterwards attempt the high
Walls; and <hi>Censorinus</hi> from the Sea causing Ladders to be planted both on
the Shore, and in his Ships against that ill fortified Angle, which had
been always neglected; they both despised their Enemy, believing him
disarmed: but when they found new made Arms, and Men fully resolved
to defend themselves, they were surprised as at a Prodigy and retreated, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
that from the very first they committed an errour, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
they should carry the City without fighting. They made a second
assault, which succeeding no better than the first, increased the courage of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65196:29"/>
the Carthaginians; and now the Consuls fearing <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> who lay en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
on the edge of the Marish, lodged their Forces apart; <hi>Censorinus,</hi>
with his Naval Army in the Marish, against the Walls of the City, and
<hi>Manlius</hi> on the neck of the <hi>Peninsula,</hi> towards the Continent. Being thus
posted, <hi>Censorinus</hi> passed the Marish, to go in search of Materials for the
building of Engines, where he lost five hundred Workmen; and great
quantity of Arms having been encountred by <hi>Amilcar,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Phameas,</hi>
Colonel of the Carthaginian Horse: yet forbore he not the bringing of
Materials, with which having caused to be made Ladders, and other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines,
he with them returned to the a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ault, but in vain. <hi>Manlius</hi> after
some slight attempts, and beating down part of the first Wall, desparing
of success, gave over the Enterprise: but <hi>Censorinus</hi> having filled up a part
of the Marish near to the point of the Land to gain more room, raised two
Rams of an extraordinary size, of which one was driven forward by six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand<note n="*" place="margin">It is to be imagined, he means, but a part laboured at a time, and when weary, were relieved by others.</note>
Foot, encouraged by the Orders and Presence of their Captains; and
the other by the Gally-slaves, whose labour was over-seen by those who
had the command of the Gallies. This begat subject of Emulation, so
that the Commanders, as well as the others striving, who should out-do
each other, a great part of the Wall was soon overthrown, and the City
might plainly be seen into. The Carthaginians on their side did not sleep,
but apply'd themselves to repair by night, what breaches the Rams had
made by day; but because the night was not sufficient for so great a
labour, fearful lest the Romans should easily beat down again what they
had repaired, whilst it was yet moist and unsettled; they resolved upon
a Sally, and some with Swords, and others with Torches in their Hands,
so vigorously assaulted the Engines, that though they burnt them not quite,
yet they rendred them useless, and retreated into the City in order. Day
appearing, the Romans entertained a conceit of entring <hi>Carthage,</hi> by the
breach which the Inhabitants could not quite repair, and they saw with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a spacious place very proper to fight in. The Carthaginians expected
them, having placed in the Front all their Armed men, others with Stones
and Clubs in the Rear, and all about in the neighbouring Houses, those
who were any way capable of defending them. The Romans enraged
that disarmed men thus despised them, entred in throngs into <hi>Carthage:</hi>
but <hi>Scipio,</hi> to whom the taking of this City gave afterwards the sirname of
<hi>Africanus,</hi> being yet but<note n="*" place="margin">Colonel of 1000 men.</note> Tribune, took special care not to enter, contenting
himself with drawing up his Regiment by Companies in Battel, near the
Walls of the City; from whence, as much as in him lay, he hindred o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
from passing in, and sustained those whom the Carthaginians beat
back, by favouring their retreat; and this was it, gave him his first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
and made him gain the Character, in all Letters that were wrote
to <hi>Rome,</hi> of being wiser than the Consuls: At length <hi>Censorinus</hi> his Army
becoming sorely afflicted with sickness, by reason of being posted among
dead and stinking waters, and that the height of the Buildings hindred
them from breathing the Sea Air, he resolved to put to Sea; but the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians
having observed, that the wind blew directly to the Roman Fleet,
filled with Tow and dried Vine-twigs, a quantity of small Barques with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Port, that the Enemy might know nothing of it; and having
plaistred them over with Pitch and Brimstone, brought them out in sight of
the Romans, and there hoisting sail, set fire to them; so that the wind, and
the violence of the flames drove them into the midst of the Fleet, which
were almost all burn'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:65196:29"/>
After this, <hi>Censorinus</hi> being gone to <hi>Rome</hi> to be present at the Assembly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLII"/>
then to meet for Election of Magistrates; his departure gave such boldness
to the Carthaginians, as to make an attempt upon <hi>Manlius</hi> his Camp. To
this end they sallyed by night, some armed, and others who had no Arms
carrying Bridges; and stormed the Ditch in that place next the Town,
and were already pulling out the Palisades, when the Alarm being run
through the whole Camp, by reason of the obscurity of the night, <hi>Scipio</hi>
with his Horse marched out of the farther Gate, and going the round of
the Camp without the Line, terrified the Carthaginians, and made them
retreat again into their City; all the World gave <hi>Scipio</hi> the glory of having
saved the Army in this nocturnal terrour by his Conduct; and <hi>Manlius</hi>
determined to keep better Guards, and to fortifie himself, to which effect
he caused a Wall to be built in the place, where there was but a Palisade,
and built a Fort on the Sea, to receive those Ships that brought him Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions.
That done, he took the Field with ten thousand Foot, and two
thousand Horse, besides Hewers of Wood and Forragers, to gather in Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
throughout all the level Country. Those who were employed in this
Service, were commanded by Tribunes, who relieved one another accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their turns, which gave occasion to <hi>Phameas,</hi> who commanded the
African Horse to signalize himself; this young man diligent and handy,
and who had with him small but swift Horses, which lived on Herbs when
they had nothing else; and could endure hunger and thirst, if there were
occasion, concealed himself among the Woods, or in the Valleys; and when
he perceived the Enemy stood not upon their Guard, sallyed from his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
and came thundring upon them like an Eagle; and after having
charged the Romans, retreated into a place of security. But when <hi>Scipio</hi>
commanded, he never appeared; for <hi>Scipio</hi> continually kept his Foot in
order, and his Horse in a fighting posture; and when any Corn was to be
cut, he never suffered the Reapers to go to work, till he had first gone the
round of the Field they were to cut down, both with Horse and Foot in
their Arms, himself guarding the out-skirts with some Squadrons; and if
any of the labourers stragled from the others, or went out of the Circle,
he punished them severely, wherefore <hi>Phameas</hi> never durst attempt him;
and <hi>Scipio</hi> still continuing his vigilance, his glory increased from day to
day; insomuch, that the other Tribunes, who envyed him, raised a report
that there was an old Alliance between <hi>Scipio,</hi> and the Family of <hi>Phameas.</hi>
It happened also that some Africans retiring themselves to some Towers or
Castles, of which there are great number in that Country: the other Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes,
after having granted them Pass-ports, forbore not to lay Ambushes
for them in the way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and rob them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But <hi>Scipio</hi> on the contrary, convey'd
them to the very House; insomuch, that hereupon none afterwards would
enter into a Treaty, but in his presence; so much the good opinion of
his Virtue and Honesty was increased, not only in the thoughts of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
but of the Enemies themselves. <hi>Manlius</hi> being returned to the
Camp, after having gathered in Harvest, the Carthaginians by night as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
the Fort on the Sea with great violence, and besides to strike ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
into the Romans, the whole Multitude coming out of the City made
a horrible noise. The Consul ignorant of the cause of this Tumult, kept
within his Trenches: but <hi>Scipio</hi> having caused two Squadrons of Horse to
mount, each with his Torch in his hand posted in, forbidding his people to
engage, because of the night, and only giving them order to run to and fro,
so that they might make the Enemy believe they were a greater force than
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65196:30"/>
they were, and likewise strike an apprehension into them, that they were
advancing to charge them, this succeeded; for the Carthaginians afraid
of being charged on both sides, retreated into their City; and this was a
farther addition to the brave exploits already performed by <hi>Scipio,</hi> it being
now in every Mouth, he alone was worthy to have <hi>Paulus</hi> for his Father,
and to be enrolled in the Family of the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, into which he had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted.
Some time after <hi>Manlius</hi> going to <hi>Nucera</hi> with design to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
<hi>Asdrubal,</hi> the enterprise displeased <hi>Scipio,</hi> the more because he saw
that in his March he was to pass through narrow ways among the Rocks,
the tops of which were possessed by the Enemy. However he would go,
but being come within three furlongs of that General, on the Banks of a
River, which he must pass to fall on: <hi>Scipio</hi> did what he could to oblige
the Consul to a retreat, telling him another time, and other means, were
requisite to reach <hi>Asdrubal.</hi> Those who envyed him were not wanting to
oppose his proposition, and to say, that it favoured more of cowardise than
prudence to turn tail, after having seen the Enemy, and that it was to give
them an opportunity to come and charge them in the Rear. He then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
another advice; to wit, that at least they should throw up Trenches
on that side the River, that if they were repulsed, they might have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat;
but they laughed at this, and one of them said, he would lay down
his Sword, if he must obey the orders of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and not those of <hi>Manlius.</hi>
Hereupon the Consul, who was not very expert in War, past the River;
and was no sooner on the other side, but he engaged <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> where there
happened a great slaughter on both sides; but because <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> had his
Camp near, he retreated thither, from whence as from a place of security,
he observed in what manner he might defeat the Romans, who already
repenting themselves of their enterprize, regained the River in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
yet could they not very commodiously repass it, because there were
but few Fords, and those very dangerous, so that they were forced to file
off. Now <hi>Asdrubal</hi> taking his time, charged them with great fury, slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an infinite of those who sought rather to fly than defend themselves, of
which number were three of the Tribunes, the principal of those, who
had advised the General to give battel. <hi>Scipio</hi> presently rallyed all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry
he could with three hundred Horse which he had, and dividing them
into two Squadrons, caused them to march against the Enemy each of his
side, with order not to charge at the same time, but make their discharge
of their Darts, and then immediately retreat; then charging again, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
in like manner. He was of opinion, that thus, having always one half
of them fronting the Enemy, and stopping them with force of Darts, he
should constrain him to close his Battalia's, which indeed happened; for
after often renewing this kind of fight, and that the Africans saw they
continually charged them with Darts which extremely vexed them, they
turned all their Power against <hi>Scipio,</hi> giving by this means leisure to the
rest of the Army to repass the River; and <hi>Scipio</hi> seeing the Romans on the
other side, passed himself through all the showers of Darts, thrown at him
by the Africans. Now at the beginning of this fight, four Roman Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts,
which the unexpected assault of the Enemy had hindred from gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the River, were retired to an Eminence, where <hi>Asdrubal</hi> besieged
them. The Romans perceived nothing of it, till such time as they were
about to encamp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and now they did know it, knew not what to resolve on;
some were of advice to continue their march, and not to expose a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
for a small Number. Whereupon <hi>Scipio</hi> remonstrated to them, that
when the debate was about a matter of importance, mature deliberation,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65196:30"/>
'tis true, was requisite; but that now seeing so many brave men in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
danger, nothing was to be left unattempted to releive them. In
short, having taken with him Provision for two days, he set forward, leaving
the Army in a great fear, lest he should not return himself. As soon as he
came to the place, where the Enemy besieged the Romans, he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seised of an Eminence nigh to that, to which the Cohorts were retired
to, and which was only divided from it by a very narrow Valley. His
coming hindred not the Africans from continuing the siege, for they could
not think that his men tired with travel could give any assistance to the
besieged; but he seeing that the two Hills joyning themselves together at
the foot, made but a very small Valley, advances that way, and posts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
above the Enemy; who startled at his courage and readiness, betook
themselves to a disorderly flight. He would not pursue them, because
they were the greater number, but contented himself with the saving of
these four Cohorts, which were given over for absolutely lost, The Soldiers
seeing him return contrary to their hopes, and that not only he himself was
safe, but that he had likewise saved others; gave assurance of their inward
rejoycing, by their outward acclamations and shouts of joy, conceiving
an opinion of him, that he acted nothing but by the assistance of the same
Divinity, which was believed to foretel things to his Ancestor <hi>Scipio.
Manlius</hi> returned to his Camp near the City, after having suffered suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
for not giving credit to <hi>Scipio,</hi> who would have disarmed him from
the Expedition; and whereas many thought it strange, that they had left
their Dead unburyed, especially three Tribunes; <hi>Scipio</hi> gave liberty to a
Prisoner, and sent him to <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> to entreat him to give Funerals to the
Tribunes. He caused them to be sought for among the Dead; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them by the Rings of Gold they wore (for by them are the Chiefs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Romans distinguished from the private Soldiers, who wear only
Iron ones) he gave them honourable Funerals, whether moved to it out of
humanity, or that in justice he ought it to the rule of War; or else already
reverencing the Glory of <hi>Scipio,</hi> he was willing by this Office, to oblige
that great man: To proceed, as the Romans who had had this bickering
with <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> were on their return to <hi>Carthage,</hi> still frighted with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat,
<hi>Phameas</hi> cruelly perplexed them, and on the other side the Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
came forth to meet them, so that they could not recover the Camp
without the loss of some servants which those from the City cut off.</p>
               <p>Mean while the Senate sent Commissioners to the Army to enquire into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLIII"/>
the state of affairs, to whom both <hi>Manlius,</hi> and the Chief Officers, and
likewise even those Tribunes, who had escaped from the Rout, gave an
account very advantagious in favor of <hi>Scipio.</hi> For at last so many glorious
successes had stopt the mouth of Envy; All the Army did the like, but
above all his brave Actions spoke enough for themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore the
Commissioners upon their return to <hi>Rome,</hi> published with one voice the
admirable qualities of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and the great love the Souldiers bore him,
which extreamly pleased the Senate. But now the Army being weakned
by a great many disgraces, Ambassadors were sent to <hi>Masanissa,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
forces against the Carthaginians, who found him no longer among
the living. That King finding himself oppressed with age and sickness,
and having many illegitimate Children on whom he had bestowed great
gifts, and three legitimate Sons, all of different minds and manners, he
sent to entreat <hi>Scipio</hi> as his friend, by succession from his Ancestors, to
come and see him, and to consult with him about dividing his Kingdom
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65196:31"/>
among his Children; he immediately posted away, but ere he
could arrive, <hi>Masanissa</hi> had given up the ghost, having laid his Commands
on his children to obey <hi>Scipio,</hi> in what manner soever he should divide the
succession amongst them. Those were the last words of this great man
happy in all things, for by divine favor he reconquered his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which <hi>Syphax</hi> and the Carthaginians had seized on, and enlarged it
in such manner, that from <hi>Mauritania</hi> which lies upon the Ocean he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the bounds of his Dominion into the Continent, as far as <hi>Cyrene,</hi>
giving Laws to an infinite number of people, and teaching them a sweeter
manner of living (for before the Numidians lived only on herbs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised
tillage.) He left great store of Silver in his Coffers, and many war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Troops, whom himself had exercised in revenging himself of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
He took <hi>Syphax</hi> with his own hand, and brought the Carthaginians
so low that the Romans had not afterwards so much difficulty to destroy
them. He was tall of Stature, and very strong, so that though far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
in years he would be present at all occasions so long as he lived,
and ever mounted on horseback without a saddle, but the greatest sign
of his vigorous constitution was that though he had many Children died
before him, yet he never had less then then ten living at a time after once
he had arrived that number, and being now fourscore and ten years old,
he left his youngest only four years old. That great age had he advanced
to, and bore it out well, but at length of force he must die. <hi>Scipio</hi> did
with honor cause the liberality of their father to be given to the bastard
Children; divided the mony among the legitimate Children, together
with the Revenues, and willed that they should all bear the title of
King: As for the charges of State he distributed them, to every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their capacity and inclination. He gave as by priviledge of
birth-right to <hi>Micipsa</hi> the Eldest who loved Peace the City of <hi>Cirtha</hi> the
ancient residence of the Kings, to <hi>Gulussa</hi> the second, who was a Soldier,
the Command of the Armies, and to <hi>Mastaball</hi> the third who was a
Scholar, the charge of Justice. Having made this division of the Goods and
Kingdom of <hi>Masanissa. Scipio</hi> forthwith brought <hi>Gulussa</hi> along with him
to assistance of the Romans, who having presently discovered the place
where <hi>Phameas</hi> concealed himself, and from whence he issued out to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
them, soon rid them of that inconvenience.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLIV"/> One day <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Phameas</hi> met in a place where there was only a water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
between, that was impassible. <hi>Scipio</hi> who was doubtful of some am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buscades,
advanced only with three of his people, to make discovery, and
<hi>Phameas</hi> came forward on the other side accompanied only with one,
which made <hi>Scipio,</hi> judging he had a desire to speak with him, advance
likewise only with one to attend him, when they were nigh enough to
hear each other, he spake thus to the African, <hi>Why do not you labour for
your particular safety, since you can do nothing for your Country?</hi> to which
the other answered, <hi>and what safety can I expect, in the Estate to which</hi>
Carthage <hi>is reduced, after having done you so much mischief.</hi> Assuredly
replyed <hi>Scipio, if you believe I have any power, and that I am a man of Faith
and Honor, I dare promise you in the name of the Romans not only grace and
pardon but acknowledgements.</hi> The African thanked him that had more
confidence in him than in all others, and told him, <hi>I will think of it, and
if I believe it may be done I will give you notice, and with that they parted.</hi>
Now <hi>Manlius</hi> to wipe away the stain of his first expedition to <hi>Nucera,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
thither, and having taken provisions for fifteen days, encamped,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65196:31"/>
and fortified himself, as <hi>Scipio</hi> had counselled him to do the first time,
but he was a long time without doing any thing, which blasted his fame
the more, besides the hazard he ran the Army into of being beaten by
<hi>Asdrubal</hi> upon their return to <hi>Carthage.</hi> Whilst he lay thus in an incertainty
what to do, one of <hi>Gulussa</hi>'s people brought a packet to <hi>Scipio,</hi> who keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it sealed till he came to the full Council of War, there broke it open
and found writ in it, to this effect, <hi>Such a day I will come to such a place,
meet me there with what force you please, and give Order to those who are upon
the Guard, to receive me if I come by night.</hi> To this purpose were the
contents of the Letters which had no name subscribed, but <hi>Scipio</hi> perceived
well that it was an invention of <hi>Phameas.</hi> Though <hi>Manlius</hi> was fearful
lest <hi>Scipio</hi> might be deceived by that politick man, yet seeing he had a
good opinion of him, he permitted him to go to the place assigned, with
Orders to receive an Oath of Fidelity from <hi>Phameas,</hi> without assuring him
any set reward, but only promising that the Senate would recompence
him, according to his deservings. But there was no need of these promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
for as soon as <hi>Phameas</hi> was come to the place appointed, he said that
he put his own safety into the hands of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and for recompence he
referred himself to the judgment of the Senate and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
the morrow after having given his parol, he drew up all his Troops in
battalia, and being advanced to the head of them with the Officers, as if he
were about to consult of something of importance, he spoke to them in this
manner.</p>
               <p>If there remained any hopes to relieve our Country, I should be ready to die
with you: but seeing it in the Condition in which you all know it, I am resolved
to take Order for my own affairs: I have assurance given me for my self and those
that will follow me: Now you are to think what you have to do.</p>
               <p>Having thus spoken, the Captains and those who were under their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
to the Number of two thousand two hundred Horse, declared for the
Romans, the rest stood firm by vertue of the authority and perswasion of
<hi>Hanno</hi> surnamed the White. As <hi>Scipio</hi> returned to the Camp, accompanied
with <hi>Phameas,</hi> all the Army came forth to meet him, receiving him with a
general acclamation as in a Triumph. But <hi>Manlius</hi> above all expressed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
joy, and no longer fearing his retreat might be shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
because he believed <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> startled at the Revolt of <hi>Phameas,</hi> durst not
follow him, he discamped for want of Provisions, not the fifteenth day after
his departure, but the seventeenth. And because he had yet three days
march through troublesome ways, <hi>Scipio</hi> took <hi>Phameas</hi> and <hi>Gulussa</hi> with
their Horse, and made an inroad into the Country which the inhabitants
of the place call the <hi>Great Abyss</hi> from whence they returned at night to their
quarters, with a great booty, and good store of Provisions. <hi>Manlius</hi>
having advice that <hi>Calphurnius Piso</hi> came to succeed him, sent <hi>Scipio</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to <hi>Rome,</hi> together with <hi>Phameas,</hi> whom all the Army conducted to
the very Ships, beseeching the Gods to grant them the favor, that they
might see <hi>Scipio</hi> return into <hi>Africa</hi> in the quality of Consul, as if it had
been decreed by the destinies, that <hi>Scipio</hi> only could take <hi>Carthage,</hi> and in
truth many of the Army wrote as much to <hi>Rome.</hi> The Senate gave pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
praises to <hi>Scipio,</hi> honored <hi>Phameas</hi> with the Purple-robe, and chain of
Gold, presented him with a Horse barded with Gold, and a Suit of Arms
of the same gave him, besides six thousand Sesterces; and one hundred and
fifty<note n="*" place="margin">Each Mark con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining eight
Ounces.</note> Marks of wrought Silver, together with a Tent furnished with all
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65196:32"/>
necessary moveables, and gave him hopes of much more if he applyed
himself heartily to the service of the Republick: he promised it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
returned into <hi>Africa,</hi> to joyn with the Roman Camp.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLV"/> In the beginning of the Spring <hi>Calphurnius Piso</hi> Consul, and his Collegue
<hi>L. Mancinus</hi> Admiral embarked for <hi>Africa,</hi> whither being come, they
made no attempt at all neither against <hi>Carthage</hi> nor against <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> but
contented themselves to make War upon the little Cities round about, they
besieged <hi>Aspida</hi> by Sea and Land, but were forced to raise their Siege. 'Tis
true <hi>Piso</hi> took another Town which he sack't, though the inhabitants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
they had surrendred upon composition: From thence he passed to
<hi>Hippone</hi> which is a great City, considerable for it's Walls, it's Castle,
it's Gates, and it's Haven, and which had been thus fortified by <hi>Agathocles</hi>
Tyrant of <hi>Sicily.</hi> It being Situate near to <hi>Utica</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
plundered the Convoys of Victuals that were carrying to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
with which they were in some measure accommodated; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Calphurnius</hi> designed not only to chastise them, but likewise to make
them restore the Prizes they had taken. He therefore laid siege to it,
which continued all the Summer, but in vain, for the inhabitants made
two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>allies, wherein being assisted by those of <hi>Carthage,</hi> they burnt all the
besiegers Engines. Thus Summer being spent without doing any thing,
the Consul went to take up his Winter quarters at <hi>Utica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLVI"/> But the Carthaginians, who had yet all <hi>Asdrubal</hi>'s Army entire, proud
of the success of <hi>Hippone,</hi> where they had beaten <hi>Piso,</hi> and strengthned
besides with eight hundred Numidian Horse, which had revolted from
<hi>Gulussa</hi> to them under the conduct of <hi>Bythias,</hi> enlarged their hopes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
they perceived that though <hi>Micypsa</hi> and <hi>Mavastabal,</hi> the other sons
of <hi>Masanissa,</hi> promised Arms and Mony to the Romans, yet they only
temporized in expectation to see what course these affairs would take. They
began therefore to spread themselves throughout all <hi>Africa,</hi> and without
fear to fortifie places in the Country, declaiming every where against the
cowardise of the Romans, and to perswade the people, they loudly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
the two expeditions of <hi>Nucera,</hi> which had redounded to their
shame, the last occasion of <hi>Hippone,</hi> where they had been so ill handled,
and at last having besieged <hi>Carthage</hi> it self though disarmed, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided
of all things, yet they had been forced to raise the siege. They
sent likewise to <hi>Micypsa,</hi> to <hi>Mavastabal,</hi> and to the free Moors, to advise
them to take care left if the Romans took <hi>Carthage,</hi> they should after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
invade and subdue them. They deputed some likewise into <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi>
where one who called himself the Son of <hi>Perseus</hi> made War
against the Romans, to exhort him to continue it, with promises that <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
would not let him want either Mony or Shipping. In short, now
they saw themselves armed, they entertained no other but exalted thoughts,
and their courage and their resolution daily increased, as they beheld
themselves in a better condition of defence. <hi>Asdrubal</hi> their General
abroad was no less resolute, after having twice successfully dealt with
<hi>Manlius,</hi> which had raised his thoughts to that degree that he grew ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
of having likewise the command of the Forces within the City,
which to compass he caused <hi>Asdrubal</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Gulussa,</hi> who at that
time commanded, to be falsely accused in full Senate, of holding intelligence
with his Uncle. At which he being so surprised that he could answer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for himself, was knockt on the head with stools.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:65196:32"/>
But when the cowardise of <hi>Piso,</hi> and the preparations made by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLVII"/>
Carthaginians came to be known at <hi>Rome,</hi> the people were extreamly
moved, out of an apprehension they had, left this War, undertaken against
a neighboring Nation, and from all time enemy to the Roman name;
should grow upon them. For they having been first deficient in their
word, as to what they ordained the Carthaginians, there was no more
hopes left of an accommodation. The memory of those Noble Actions
done by <hi>Scipio,</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> whilst he was yet but Tribune, was yet very
fresh, and the comparison of present affairs, with what he had done, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
so much the more the glory of his reputation, and as in all meetings
every one told what was writ from the Army, all the world wish't his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
in quality of Consul; the day of the Assembly for the Election of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
drew nigh, but his not being of the age admitted by Law to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
that dignity forbid his pretending to it, for he demanded only the
charge of <hi>Edile,</hi> when the people offered him the Consulate. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
stood against it, and opposed the Law contrary to this Election, but
the multitude persisted the more, alleaging that by the Laws of <hi>Tullus</hi> and
<hi>Romulus,</hi> the people were Judges of the Assembly, and so it belonged to
them to approve or cancel all Laws that concerned the Assembly. At last
one of the Tribunes threatned the Consuls to take away their power of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding
if they agreed not to the will of the people, whereupon they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the Tribunes to abrogate that Law for a year, provided it were
then re-established. The Lacedemonians it seems did the same, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forced to make the Laws yield to necessity, to secure from infamy
those taken Prisoners at <hi>Piles,</hi> they cryed out, <hi>Let us this day give the Laws
leave to sleep.</hi> Thus <hi>Scipio</hi> demanding the Edility, obtained the Consulate,
and when <hi>Drusus</hi> that was likewise named Consul, required that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Provinces should be drawn by Lot, one of the Tribunes
assembled the people and speaking of the War with <hi>Carthage,</hi> demanded
to which of the Consuls they would give their Commission. So the people
gave to <hi>Scipio</hi> the Government of that Province, permitting him to raise
recruits to compleat the old Troops and to form new ones, to receive
from the Allies all those volunteers would follow him, and to write in the
name of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> to what Kings and Cities he thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
and indeed some Kings, and some Estates did assist him with
forces.</p>
               <p>Things thus disposed, he passed into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and from thence forthwith
to <hi>Utica,</hi> mean while <hi>Piso</hi> besieged some Inland Towns, and <hi>Mancinus</hi>
lay constantly before <hi>Carthage,</hi> where having observed a certain place in
the wall neglected, because it was almost inaccessible by reason of the rocks
that surrounded it, he thought he might secretly gain it, and having made
provision of ladders prepared for the storm; some Soldiers mounted bravely,
but the Carthaginians despising their slender Number opened a gate by the
side of the rocks, and made a Sally upon the Romans, who so briskly repulsed
them, that many Soldiers entred Pelmel with them into the City, and
shouted amain, as if they had already been Masters of it. <hi>Mancinus</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished
with joy (rash and heady as he was) with all those that remained
in the Ships came forth half Armed, and ran to the walls to second their
companions, but night coming on forced the Admiral to lodge in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Post near the the Walls where he kept without doing any thing, and
because he had neither Arms nor Victuals, he sent messengers to <hi>Piso</hi> to
give him notice to come to his relief, and to the Magistrates of <hi>Utica,</hi> that
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65196:33"/>
they should forthwith dispatch away Provisions; for he ran the hazard of
being assaulted as soon as it was day, by the Carthaginians, and thrown
headlong from the top of the Rocks. <hi>Scipio,</hi> who landed the same Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Utica,</hi> having seen <hi>Mancinus</hi> his Letter, presently caused the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
to sound, to give warning to those were already landed to get forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
aboard, giving orders to all the Youth of <hi>Utica</hi> to be in a readiness
to follow him, and to the old men to bring Provisions on board the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
and releasing some Carthaginian Prisoners, he sent them unto the
City to let them understand that <hi>Scipio</hi> was arrived with a mighty Fleet.
He dispatched likewise several Messengers one after another to <hi>Piso,</hi> to
command him to come to him with all speed. About the last Watch he
went to Sea, giving order to the Soldiers, that as soon as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
the Town, they should all stand upright on the Hatches, that the
Enemy might believe them the greater number. Towards the Break of
Day, <hi>Mancinus</hi> being charged on all sides by the Carthaginians, had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a round Battalia, encompassed by all the armed men he had, in the midst
of which were inclosed above three thousand without Armour, but at last
the Showers of Darts, and multitudes of Wounds had reduced them to the
point of seeking their safety down the Precipices, when they saw <hi>Scipio</hi>'s
Ships appear full of Soldiers, which surprized not the Carthaginians, who
had already received advice of it by their Prisoners, but saved the lives of
the Romans, who were almost hopeless; for at the approach of this Fleet,
the Carthaginians gave ground, and the Romans withdrawn from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
wherein they were, got aboard their Ships.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLVIII"/>
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> sent back <hi>Mancinus</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> (for <hi>Serranus</hi> his Successor was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
come to command the Fleet) and went himself and encamped near
<hi>Carthage.</hi> The Carthaginians on their part went and encamped directly
opposite unto him, whither came to them <hi>Asdrubal</hi> that commanded the
Field-Army, and <hi>Bythias</hi> Colonel of the Horse, with six thousand old Foot,
and a thousand chosen Horse. But <hi>Scipio</hi> finding the Military Discipline
much corrupted; that under <hi>Piso</hi> the Soldiers had been accustomed to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleness,
Rapine and Avarice; that in the Camp there was an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of those Sutlers and Pedlars, whom only the hopes of prey made
follow the Army, who debauched the best Soldiers to straggle with them,
only to pillage and plunder, though by the Rules of War, he that went so
far from the Camp, that he could not hear the Sound of the Trumpet, was
to be proceeded against as a Run-away, and that all the mischief these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
did was imputed to the Army, and all the plunder taken begot only
matter of quarrel and dissention; for it often happened, that for a trifle
Comrades fell together by the ears, and killed one another. <hi>Scipio,</hi> I say,
having observed this, and knowing well he should never compass his ends
on the Enemy, unless he first made himself Master of his own Troops, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
his Army, and taking his Seat on the Tribunal, spoke in this
manner:</p>

This is the reason, why in that little time. I have been absent, the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian
Affairs are so well recovered: so that being now come to command you, I
find that the reforming your evil orders will be the greatest part of trouble. If

I attribute it to another, I forget what's past. For my part I came not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to plunder, but to conquer. I ask no Money from the Enemy before the
Victory, and will patiently wait till they be fully defeated. 'Tis therefore my
pleasure, that all those people in the Camp, who hear not Arms, depart, from this
very day, except only some few whom I shall give leave to stay; and I forbid
any, whoever he be, to return, unless it be to bring Provisions, and such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions

and if you do it indeed, be assured, that your Endeavours will never want Success,

               <p>After having spoken thus, he forthwith caused all useless persons to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLIX"/>
driven out of the Camp, and with them sent away all that was rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
than necessary. Having thus purged his Army, and disposed his
Soldiers to obedience, he designed one night secretly to make an Assault by
two several ways upon a certain great place against the Walls of the City,
called <hi>Megara,</hi> and having sent those about, who were to make the Attaque
on the one side, he took his march towards the other, causing to be brought
along Axes, Croes and Ladders, he had already advanced a pretty way in
the dark, without making any noise, when those that were upon the Wall
perceived him, which they signified by their Cries, to which he answered
first, and after him all the Assailants in like manner. There was likewise a
great Cry raised on the other side, which gave the first terrour to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,
astonished to be two several ways assaulted by so many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and by night. <hi>Scipio</hi> however, notwithstanding all the endeavours

and near the Walls there was a void Tower of the same heighth, which
belonged to a private person, he caused some resolute young men to mount
up into it, who having with force of Darts made those who defended the
Wall, dislodge, laid Planks and Joysts over, and so passed to the Parapet,
and thence leaped down into the place, and having broken open the Gate,
gave entrance to <hi>Scipio</hi> with four thousand Men, forcing the Inhabitants to
retreat into the Fortress, as if all the rest of the City had been taken. In
this Alarm and confused Tumult they took some Prisoners; and those who
were encamped without, forsaking their Camp, fled hastily to shelter
themselves with the rest in the Cittadel: but <hi>Scipio</hi> perceiving this place
of <hi>Megara</hi> was full of Gardens planted with Fruit-trees, and consisted of
many little Inclosures of Mud-walls, Quick-set Hedges, Bushes, and some
little Streams, fearing left the Soldiers among so many Turnings and Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65196:34"/>
which they were unacquainted with, might pursue the Enemypunc; and so
give them the opportunity of laying an ambush for them, caused the Retreat
to be sounded. Day appearing, <hi>Asdrubal</hi> enraged at <hi>Scipio</hi>'s boldness,
caused all the Roman Prisoners he had to be brought upon the Wall, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Countrymen, with Pinchers or Hooks of Iron caused their Eyes

some had the Soles of their Feet cut off, and others their Fingers; some he
caused to be flead alive; and then tumbled down those high Rocks. This
he did to the end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that taking away from the Carthaginians all hopes of
Peace with the Romans, and sharpening their courages to the utmost, they
should expect no safety but from their Arms: yet his design succeeded quite
otherwise; for the Carthaginians, who found themselves made Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices
of such horrible Crimes, became rather more timerous than hardy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and began to hate <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> who had cut off from them all hopes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
especially the Senators, who loudly declared, that such cruelty and
insolence were unseasonable in the publick Calamities, by which discourse
they incensed him to that degree, that he took some of them, and slew
them with his own hands. Thus he made himself terrible, living hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
more like a Tyrant than a Governour, and making his security consist
in his being feared, believing that sufficient to warrant him against all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
might be made against his person.</p>

absolute Master of the <hi>Peninsula,</hi> he caused a Trench to be dug from one
Sea to the other, not above a Darts cast from the Enemies, who used their
utmost endeavours to hinder the work, which made it extreme painful to
the Soldiers: however, what by working, and what by fighting, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
it at length, though it were five and twenty Furlongs long. This
being finished; he caused such another to be made towards the Inland, not
far distant from the other, and after that two Traverses; so that it was a
kind of a square Fortification, which he caused to be palisadoed with sharp
Stakes, behind which he likewise caused a Ditch to be made; but that he
might fortifie himself the better towards <hi>Carthage,</hi> he inclosed it with a
Wall five and twenty Furlongs long, twelve Foot high, and six Foot broad,
in which he placed Redoubts and Towers at equal distances. In the midst
of the Fort he caused to be erected a very high Tower, on which he placed
a square Platform, from whence he might discover all that was done in the
City. These works having been finished in four and twenty days, and as
many nights (by the continual labour of all the Soldiers, who by turns
stood to their Arms, or wrought with their working Tools) <hi>Scipio</hi> lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Army. Yet he had not built this Fortification only for that use,
but likewise to serve as a Circumvallation to hinder the bringing Provisions
to the Besieged, which before came to them by land; for besides this
Neck of the <hi>Peninsula</hi> which he now possessed, all the rest was encompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the Sea. This therefore was the first and principal cause of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged's

the Port which opened to the West, very near to the Sea Shore; and to
this purpose he caused to be raised along Dam, which advanced from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>icies four and twenty Foot, and four times as
deep. The Carthaginians laughed at first, and mocked at the Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
as if in a long time, or perhaps never <hi>Scipio</hi> could have brought it
to perfection; but the whole Army laboured in it with an emulation of
each other, without resting day or night; insomuch, that at last the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
affrighted, resolved to make another entrance on the farther side of
the Port, where the <hi>Peninsula</hi> extends it self more into the Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where a
Dam could not be made, both by reason of the depth of the Water, and
violence of the Winds. All the people therefore set themselves to digging,
so much as the very Women and Children, and beginning from within,
and continuing their work without telling their design; and at the same
time mustering up all the old Materials they had, they fell to make Galleys
of divers sorts, following their business with much courage and diligence,
but so secretly, that the Prisoners themselves could give no other account
to <hi>Scipio,</hi> save that they continually heard a great noise in the Port, but
knew not what it meant. Having at last completed every thing, they sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
opened the Mouth of the Port, and about break of day came forth
with fifty Galleys, and great quantity of Barques, Brigantines, and other
smaller Vessels, in so good order, that they were very capable to strike.
This new Mouth so unexpectedly opened, and the unthought of coming
out of such a Fleet, so startled the Romans, that had the Carthaginians
immediately fell upon their Fleet, unfurnished both of Mariners and Slaves,
all hands being employed in the Works to advance the Siege, they might
easily have made themselves Masters of it. But because it was decreed by
the Destinies, that <hi>Carthage</hi> should be razed, they contented themselves
with this vain Shew, and proud Bravado, retreating into their Port with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doing any thing else.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:65196:35"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LII"/> Three days afterwards they came forth again to Sea, with design to
engage the Romans in good earnest, whose Fleet being now in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
set forward to meet them, they began the fight with great shouts on
both sides, the Seamen, Souldiers and Commanders equally shewing their
Courage, the one party fighting for their safety, the other to compleat
their Victory, so that there was a furious fight on both parts, nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be seen but wounds and death. In the fight the Carthaginian Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantines
gliding along under the banks of the great Roman Galleys broke
them, sometimes in the Poop, sometime struck of their Rudders, and
sometime burst a sunder their Oars, so that they damaged them extreamly,
and when they found themselves overcharged, they rowed off with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Nimbleness, and as nimbly returned to the Charge. At last the
two Fleets having fought till Sun setting with equal advantage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians
thought it convenient to retire, not that they confessed themselves
overcome, but that they might next morning return to the fight in better
order. In this retreat their smaller Vessels, being lighter and swifter, got
the Van, and entring in a huddle into the Port, so stopt the entrance of the
great Vessels, that they were forced to retire to a very spacious key built
against the City-wall for the unlading of which they had during this War,
raised a little rampart, for fear left the enemies should possess it. There
they stood firm with their Prows twined towards their enemies, all the
Soldiers standing in a fighting posture, some upon the Ships, others on the
Key, and others on the Rampart. The Romans who followed them had
no great difficulty to assail them, for tis not hard to fight with Ships that
lie still; but when they were again to draw of, because of their length,
not being able to turn nimbly, they received as much damage in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
as they had given in the Charge, for as they turned about, they
were forced to receive all the blows of the shot from the Carthaginian
Engines on their broad sides. At last five Ships which the City of <hi>Sidon,</hi>
allies of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> had sent to <hi>Scipio,</hi> went and dropt their
Anchors out at Sea, at a good distance from the Carthaginian, and giving
scope of Cable enough advanced by force of Oars, and after having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
their charge, warped back again by their Cables, which they had
brought in at their poop, and then again returned to the Charge, and in
like manner retreated. All the Fleet followed the Example of those of
<hi>Sidon,</hi> whereby the Carthaginians were much damaged till such time as
the fight having continued a good part of the night, the remainder of their
Ships <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LIII"/> Morning being come, <hi>Scipio</hi> attempted the Key, because he thought the
gaining of it would make the mouth of the Port useless, he therefore cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Rams, and other batteries to be planted against the Rampart, with
which he beat down a part of it. But the Carthaginians though oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with hunger, and many other inconveniences, forbore not by night
to assault the Roman Engines, not by Land, for there was no passage,
nor upon Ships, for the Sea was too shallow, but naked and without light
(for fear they should be discovered far of) they entred the Sea, where
none kept guard, and passing, some wading with the water up to their
brests, and others swimning till they came very near the batteries, where
when they could no longer couceal themselves, because they had lighted
their fires, naked as they were, they received an infinite of wounds; yet
not without revenge, for their fury carried them to strange resolutions,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65196:35"/>
and all gored as they were with Arrows and Darts in their Brests, &amp; in their
Faces, yet they abated nothing of their violence, but like fierce beasts pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
forward to meet the strokes, till having set fire to the Engines, they so
dismayed those that defended them, that they took their flight towards
the Camp, where never before was seen such an alarm, as this, caused by
naked enraged people. <hi>Scipio</hi> astonished at the disorder came forth of the
Camp, with some Horsemen, whom he commanded to kill those that
would not stand, and with his own hands he killed some, and by that
means obliged the rest, who else had been all lost, to keep their post,
where they stood all the night in Arms. As soon as it was day, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians
delivered from the trouble of the Engines, labored to repair
that part of the Rampier that was broken down, adding towers at certain
intervals. On the other side the Romans made other Engines, and planted
them on platforms, which raised them as high as the towers of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and from thence cast burning torches, brimstone and pots full of
flaming pitch, with which they burnt some of them, which put the
Carthaginians to flight, and opened the Romans a way to the Key
to pursue them, but because the ground on which they ran was slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
by reason of the blood shed there, they could not overtake
them. <hi>Scipio</hi> being become Master of the Key, lodged on it, fortified
it, and caused a wall of brick to be built to the Cityward, very near
the City walls, and of equal height. When it was finished he caused
four thousand Men to get upon it with Orders to ply the enemy conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
with Darts and Arrows, which extreamly afflicted them, for
the two walls being of an equal height, there was scarce a Dart thrown
in vain, thus ended the Summer.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of the Winter, <hi>Scipio</hi> determined to clear the Country <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LIV"/>
of those Forces the Carthaginians had yet abroad, and to possess himself
of all those places from whence they might convey provisions. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sent his Captains, some one way and some another, and himself
embarking went towards <hi>Nephera</hi> along the Marish, after having given
Order to <hi>C. Lelius</hi> to march by Land to the intent that he might force
<hi>Diogenes</hi> one of <hi>Asdrubals</hi> party from an advantagious post. As soon as
he arrived, he encamped within two hundred and fifty paces of <hi>Diogenes,</hi>
and having left <hi>Gulussa</hi> in the Camp, to prosecute the War with him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Carthage.</hi> He continued often to go and return from one place
to the other, to see how things passed, till such time as two towers of the
Fort in which <hi>Diogenes</hi> was posted being thrown down, <hi>Scipi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> sends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the Fort a thousand chosen Soldiers, while himself assaulted the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
with three thousand others, choice men likewise, who marched upon
the ruines, not in confusion but in a body, the Soldiers having orders to
fight so close lockt together that they could not be repulsed, those in the
first rank being susteined by the others that followed. At the noise made
by the Assailants the Africans ran to defend themselves, but whilst they
were all imployed there, the thousand Soldiers behind, according to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
given them, forced the Camp, and having pulled out or cut the Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadoes,
violently rushed in with a wonderful boldness whilst none were
aware of it, or so much as doubted of such an Assault. The enemies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
them, betook themselves to flight, for they believed them
a far greater Number then what they saw, and <hi>Gulussa</hi> who pursued
them with his Numidians, and Elephants, made a strange and bloody
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65196:36"/>
slaughter, for there perished threescore and ten thousand men, accounting
the Country people, ten thousand were taken Prisoners, and not above
four thousand in all saved themselves. Afterwards <hi>Scipio</hi> took the City
of <hi>Nephera</hi> with great labor, the siege lasting two and twenty days in a cold
season and incommodious place. This victory contributed much to the
taking of <hi>Carthage,</hi> for the Army at <hi>Nephera</hi> furnished the besieged with
provisions, and that Fort hardned the Africans in their obstinacy, but after
it was taken, all the other garrisons in the Country voluntarily surrendred
to <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Captains. Thus all the Country about <hi>Carthage</hi> being under
the Roman obedience, and it being impossible to have any thing by
Sea by reason of the War and Winter, Victuals grew very scarce in the
City.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LV"/> As soon as Spring came on, <hi>Scipio</hi> assaulted the Citadel called <hi>Byrsa,</hi> and
and the gate called <hi>Coton</hi> at the same time, which caused <hi>Asdrubal</hi> to set
on fire that part of the gate which was square, but whilst he expected
<hi>Scipio</hi> should make a new attempt on that side, and stood firm with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants;
<hi>Lelius</hi> mounted privately by the other side of the gate which
was of a round figure, and making himself Master of it, the shouts of
those that were already got up, so dismayd the enemies, that the other
Soldiers now contemning the besieged, and having filled all the places dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to pass with Beams, Engines and Planks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they leapt in on all sides, in
spite of all the resistance of the guards oppressed with hunger, and lost to
all courage: <hi>Scipio</hi> thus possest of the wall that encompassed the gate called
<hi>Coton,</hi> got thence into the great place of the City which was nigh unto it,
where night coming on, and not suffering him to go farther; he kept
there in Arms with those Soldiers he had with him, and as soon as day
broke, caused four thousand fresh men to come thither, who being got into
<hi>Apollo</hi>'s Temple, plundered his Statue, which was all of Gold, and all the
inside of the Temple, which was covered with Plates of Gold, of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Talents weight. They cut in pieces the Plates with their Swords,
do what their Captains could to hinder them, till such time as having got
what they could, they pursued their enterprize. Mean while <hi>Scipio</hi>'s
chief design was against the place called <hi>Byrsa,</hi> for that was the strongest
of all the City, and a world of people were retreated thither. The way
from the great place thither, was up hill, through three Streets, on each
side of which there was a continuance of very high houses, whose upper
stories jetting somewhat over into the Street, whole showers of Darts
flew from thence upon the Romans, who were constrained before they
passed farther, to force the first houses, and there post themselves, that
from thence they might drive out those that fought in the neighboring
houses, and after they had driven them out, they laid Beams and Planks
from one side of the Street to the other, on which, as on Bridges they pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
cross the Streets, thus they maintained War in the Chambers, whilst
as fast as they met, they fought more cruelly below in the Streets. All
places were filled with crys and groans, people dying a thousand different
sorts of Deaths, some at Swords-point, some thrown headlong down from
the tops of the houses, upon the pavement, others falling upon Javelins,
Pikes and Swords, presented against them, however none durst yet set
fire, because of those who maintained the fight in the losts; but when
<hi>Scipio</hi> had gained the foot of the Fortress, all the three Streets were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
on a flame, and the Soldiers had charge to hinder the ruines of the
houses caused by the fire, from falling into the Street, that the whole Army
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65196:36"/>
might have the more convenient passage: And now were new spectacles
of calamity to be seen, the fire devouring, and overturning the houses, and
the Roman Soldiers all about, so far from hindring it, that they endeavored
to involve the rest in the same ruine. The miserable Carthaginians in
despair falling confusedly with the Stones and Bricks on the Pavement,
dead bodies, nay people yet living, and especially old Men, Women and
Children, who had hid themselves in the most secret places of the houses,
some laden with wounds others half burnt, and all crying out in a deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
manner, others tumbling headlong from the upper stories of the
houses, among the Mass of Stones and Wood, were in their falls torn in
pieces. Nor was this the end of their miseries, for the Pioneers who to
make way for the Soldiers removed the Rubbish out of the middle of the
Streets, tossed with their Hooks and Forks, the bodies, as well of the
dead as living into the vaults, turning them with their Iron Instruments,
as if they had been pieces of Wood or Stones, so that there might be seen
holes full of heaps of men, of which some having been headlong thrown
in, yet breathed a long time, and lay with their legs above ground, and
others interred up to the neck, were exposed to the cruelty of the Masons
and Pioneers, who took pleasure to see their heads, and brains crushed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the horses feet, for these sort of people placed not those wretches, so
by chance, but of set purpose. As for the Men of War their being enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the fight, with the hopes of approaching victory, the eagerness of
the Soldiers, heightned by the sounds of the Trumpets, the noise made by
the Majors and Captains in giving their Orders, made them even like fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and hindred them from amusing themselves at these Spectacles. In
this bloody toil they continued six days and six nights without respit,
save only that the Soldiers were from time to time relieved by other fresh
ones, lest the continual watchings, labor, slaughter and horror should make
their hearts fail them. <hi>Scipio</hi> only bore out all this time without sleeping,
he was continually in action, continually running from one place to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and taking no food, but what offered it self by chance as he was
passing, till such time as quite tyred out he sat down in an eminent place,
that he might see what passed. Mean while strange havock was made on
all sides, and this calamity seemed likely to continue much longer, when
on the seventh day they had recourse to his clemency and came to him
bringing in their hand the Vervein of <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> whose Temple is the
most considerable in all the Fortress, desiring no other composition, but
that he would please to give their lives, to all that would come forth, which
he granted to them, except only to the Runaways. There came forth fifty
thousand as well Men as Women, whom he caused to pass out of the little
Gate towards the Fields, with a good guard. The Runaways who were
about nine hundred, seeing there was no mercy for them withdrew into
the Temple with <hi>Asdrubal</hi> his Wife and Children, where though they
were but a small Number they might defend themselves, because of the
height of the place situated upon Rocks, and to which in times of peace
they ascended by sixty steps, but at length oppressed with famine, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and fear, and seeing their destruction so nigh, Impatience siesed them,
and quitting the lower part of the Temple they fled to the highest story.
<hi>Asdrubal</hi> mean while privately withdrew himself, and went to <hi>Scipio</hi> with
a branch of Olive in his hand: <hi>Scipio</hi> having commanded him to come up,
and prostrate himself at his feet, shewed him to the Runaways, who seeing
him, demanded silence, which being granted after having vomited forth
an infinite number of revilings and reproaches against <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> they set
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65196:37"/>
fire to the Temple, and buried themselves in the flame. It is said that

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="LVI"/> As for <hi>Scipio,</hi> seeing that City which had flourished for seven hundred
years since it was first built, comparable to any Empire whatsoever for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of Dominion by Sea and Land, for its Arms, for its Fleets, for its Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
for its Riches, and preferable even to all Nations on the Earth for
Generosity and Resolution, since after their Arms and Ships were taken
away, they had supported themselves against Famine and War for three
years together. Seeing it, I say, now absolutely ruined, tis said that he shed
tears and publickly deplored the hard fortune of his enemies. He consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that Cities, People and Empires are subject to Revolutions, as well as
the conditions of private Men, that the same disgrace had happened to <hi>Troy</hi>
that powerful City, and afterwards to the <hi>Assyrians, Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi>
whose Dominion extended so far, and lately to the Macedonians, whose Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
was so great and flourishing, which was the reason that unawares, and
as it were without thinking of it, that Distich of <hi>Homers</hi> escaped him.

               <p>And <hi>Polybius</hi> who had been his Tutor, demanding of him in familiar dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
what he meant by those words, he ingeniously answered, That the
consideration of the Vicissitude of Humane Affairs, had put him in mind of
his Country, whose Fate he likewise feared; as the same <hi>Polybius</hi> reports
in his Histories.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carthage</hi> thus taken, <hi>Scipio</hi> gave the Plunder to the Soldiers for some days,
except only the Gold and Silver, and Offerings, which were found in the
Temples. After which he distributed several Military recompenses to all
his Soldiers, except only to those who had pillaged <hi>Apollo's</hi> Temple. And
having caused a very light Ship to be loaden with the spoil of the Enemy, he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65196:37"/>
sent it to <hi>Rome</hi> to carry news of the Victory, and caused it be signified
throughout all <hi>Sicily,</hi> that those who would come, and claim the offerings
made to their Temples, which had been carried away by the Carthaginians
when they had made War in that Island, should have them restored. Thus
giving testimonies of his goodness in all that he could, he gained the good
will of all people. And at last having sold what remained of the spoil, he
caused all the Bucklers, Engins and useless Ships, to be piled together, and
being girt after the manner of the Romans, set fire to them as a sacrifice to
<hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Minerva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ship that went from <hi>Carthage,</hi> happened to arrive at <hi>Rome</hi> in an
Evening, where as soon as the news was known of the taking of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
all the people flock'd to the publick places, and the Night was spent
in rejoycings and imbracing each other, as if this Victory (the greatest
that ever the Romans had gained) had confirmed the Publick Repose,
which they before thought unsecure. They knew well, that they and
their Predecessors had done great things against the Macedonians, the
Spaniards, and lately against the Great <hi>Antiochus,</hi> as likewise in <hi>Italy;</hi>
but they confessed they never had a War so much to be feared as this, by
reason of the generosity, prudence and hardiness of their Enemies; nor
so perillous, by reason of their infidelity: They likewise remembred the
miseries they had suffered by the Carthaginians in <hi>Sicily,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and
likewise in <hi>Italy,</hi> for sixteen whole years together, during which <hi>Hannibal</hi>
had sackt four hundred Cities, and destroyed in divers encounters three
hundred thousand men, and being several times come to the very Gates of
their City, had reduced them to the last extremities. These things consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
made them with difficulty believe, what was tole of the victory,
and they often demanded of one another if it were certain that <hi>Carthage</hi> was
destroyed. Thus they past the night in recounting one to another, how after
having disarmed the Carthaginians, they had presently made themselves new
Arms, beyond the judgment of all the World. How having taken away
their Ships, they had built others of old stuff; and how having stopt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of their Port, they had in a few days dug a new one, on the other
side. They spoke likewise of the unmeasurable height of their Walls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
vast stones they were built with, the fire which they had several times put to
the Engines. In short they represented to the eyes of the Auditors the whole
figure of this War; insomuch that giving life to their discourse by their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
they seemed to see <hi>Scipio</hi> on the Ladders, on the Ships, in the Gates,
and in the Streets, running from one side to the other.</p>
               <p>The people having thus spent the night, on the morrow solemn sacrifices
were made to the Gods, and Publick Prayers, wherein every Tribe assisted
separately: after which Plays and Spectacles were exhibited to publick view,
and then the Senate sent ten Commissioners, of the Number of the Fathers,
to settle joyntly with <hi>Scipio,</hi> such Orders as were most necessary for that
Province and for the Romans best advantage. As soon as they were
arrived they Ordered <hi>Scipio</hi> to demolish what remained of <hi>Carthage;</hi> hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
forbidding any to inhabit there, with horrible imprecations against
those, who in prejudice of this Interdict, should attempt to Rebuild any
thing, especially the Fort called <hi>Byrsa,</hi> and the place called <hi>Megara,</hi> to the
rest they defended no mans entrance. They decreed likewise, that all the
Cities which in that War had held on the Enemies party should be razed,
and gave their Territories Conquered by the Roman Arms, to the Roman
Allies, particularly gratifying those of <hi>Utica,</hi> with all the Country extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from <hi>Carthage</hi> to <hi>Hippone,</hi> they made all the rest of the Province Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65196:38"/>
from which neither Men nor Women were exempt, resolving that
every year there should a <hi>Praetor</hi> sent form the City, and having given these
Orders they returned to <hi>Rome. Scipio</hi> having Executed them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
himself at the height of his wishes, made sacrifices, and set forth
Plays in Honour of the Gods, and after setling all things in a good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> whither he entred in Triumph. Never was any
thing beheld more glorious, for there was nothing to be seen but Statues
and Rarities, and curious pieces of an inestimable price, which the Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
had for so long a time been bringing into <hi>Africa,</hi> from all parts of the
World, where they had gained an infinite of Victories. This hapned
near the same time that <hi>Mummius</hi> Triumphed the third time over the
Macedonians, and the first time over the Greeks, after having overcome
<hi>Andriscus,</hi> who gave himself out to be <hi>Philip,</hi> about the hundred and six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Olympiad. Some time after there arising several seditions in the City
because of the poverty of the people, under the Tribuneship of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> it
was advised to send six thousand people to inhabit in <hi>Africa;</hi> but when set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth the foundations of this Colony, in the place where formerly stood
<hi>Carthage,</hi> it was found the Wolves had removed the marks, the Senate for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
their further proceeding. Long time after, when <hi>Caesar</hi> who was
created <hi>Dictator,</hi> after his Victory over <hi>Pompey,</hi> pursued him into <hi>Egypt,</hi>
and from thence came into <hi>Africa</hi> to prosecute the War, against the friends
of his dead Enemy, 'tis said that he saw in a dream a great Army, which
shedding of tears called to him, and that moved with this dream, he set
down in his Table Book, the design he had to Rebuild <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Corinth;</hi>
but being soon after kill'd by his Enemies in the Senate, <hi>Caesar Augustus</hi>
his Son finding by chance that Memorial, caused <hi>Carthage</hi> to be Rebuilt,
which we may now behold near the place where the Ancient <hi>Carthage</hi>
stood, for he took care not to fall under the Execrations fulminated when it
was demolished. I find it on Record that they sent near three thousand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
from <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the neighboring Cities compleated the
peopling of it. Thus was <hi>Africa</hi> reduced into the form of a Province,
and <hi>Carthage</hi> ruined by the Romans was Rebuilt by themselves, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled
one hundred and one years after it was demolished.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ANtiochus,</hi> King of <hi>Syria, Babylon,</hi> and of many other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
was the Son of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> Grand-child of <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
and the sixteenth Successor from that <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who after
the Death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> reigned in that part of <hi>Asia,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
on the <hi>Euphrates.</hi> This Prince made the first proof
of his Arms against the Medes, the Parthians and other
people revolted from his Predecessors, where he signaliz'd himself by so
many Heroick Actions, that he gained the sirname of Great. Afterwards
the success of his first Enterprizes, and that glorious Title raising his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
he despoiled <hi>Ptolemy Philopator,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet but an Infant,
of the lower <hi>Syria,</hi> and part of <hi>Cilicia;</hi> and after that, setting no bound
to his designs, he transported the War towards the <hi>Hellespont</hi> into <hi>Etolia</hi>
and <hi>Ionia,</hi> where he claimed a right, by virtue of his being King of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
because formerly those Countries had been under the Dominion of
the Kings of <hi>Asia.</hi> From thence passing into <hi>Europe,</hi> he became Master of
<hi>Thrace,</hi> constraining those who offered to resist to pay him obedience.
He likewise fortified the <hi>Chersonesus,</hi> and rebuilt <hi>Lysimachia,</hi> which <hi>Lysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus,</hi>
King of <hi>Thrace,</hi> after <hi>Alexander</hi> had built as a Cittadel to keep
the people in subjection; and which after his death, the Thracians had
demolished. <hi>Antiochus</hi> undertook to repeople it, making those Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65196:39"/>
which went out of it return, redeeming those that were in slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and drawing thither many new ones, giving them Sheep and Oxen,
and Iron to Till the Ground. He was very desirous with all possible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
to put this City in a condition, and to make it the seat of that
War he had resolved on, because he believed that in all <hi>Thrace</hi> there was
no place more proper to be made a Magazine of Corn, and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions.
A great number of people had already surrendred unto him, aud
received the Garrisons for fear of his Arms, when those of <hi>Smyrna, Lamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacus,</hi>
and many others, who would not submit to his Yoke, sent their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
to <hi>Flaminius</hi> the Roman General, who a little before had in a great
Battel defeated <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> in <hi>Thessaly;</hi> for in those times and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
the Affairs of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Macedon</hi> were exremely embroiled, as we
have related in the Greek Histories. There were many deputations on
one part and the other, between <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Flaminius,</hi> but without
any effect; for the Romans and <hi>Antiochus</hi> had for a long time been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strustful
of one another. The Romans were of opinion, that this King
grown now so powerful, would not, after so many happy successes, consent
to Peace and Repose; and that Prince saw that the Romans only could
oppose his designs, there being small likelyhood they would ever suffer
him to establish a Dominion in <hi>Europe:</hi> Yet hitherto there was no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
given of a breach, when the Ambassadors of <hi>Ptolemy Philopater</hi> came
to <hi>Rome</hi> to complain that <hi>Antiochus</hi> had dispoiled him of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia.</hi>
The Senate and people of <hi>Rome</hi> were very glad that this occasion present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and presently sent their Ambassadors to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> under pretence of
reconciling the two Kings: but indeed to observe the designs of <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
and oppose them as much as they could possible. <hi>Cneus,</hi> chief of this
Embassie, required of the King, <hi>That he would not hinder</hi> Ptolemy, <hi>who was a
friend of the people of</hi> Rome, <hi>from enjoying what had been left by his Fathers:
and that he should leave in liberty those Cities, which formerly belonged to</hi>
Philip <hi>of</hi> Macedon, <hi>saying it was not reasonable, that he should take to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
what the people of</hi> Rome <hi>had conquered.</hi> To this he added, <hi>That they
were astonished he should come from</hi> Medea <hi>to the Sea-costs of</hi> Asia, <hi>with so
great a Fleet, and so powerful an Army, and already begin to trouble</hi> Europe <hi>by
building of Cities, and making himself Master of</hi> Thrace, <hi>and that there was
great appearance all these were but preparations to another War.</hi> The King
made answer, <hi>That his Predecessors had formerly possessed</hi> Thrace, <hi>but being
busied elsewhere, it had been usurped from them, and that now, that he had lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
he would recover the Possession, and had rebuilt</hi> Lysimachia <hi>for the Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of his Son</hi> Seleucus. <hi>For the rest, he would leave the Cities of</hi> Asia <hi>in
liberty, provided they would own the Obligation from him, and not from the
people of</hi> Rome. <hi>But for what respects</hi> Ptolemy, (said he) <hi>I am his Kinsman,
and shall suddenly be his Father-in-law, and then shall take care to act
in such a manner, as he shall give you thanks for the good office you have done
him: but let me in my turn be astonished too, not being able to comprehend
by what right the people of</hi> Rome <hi>meddle with the Affairs of</hi> Asia, <hi>since I
meddle not with those of</hi> Italy. Thus they parted, without doing any thing
save threatning one another. Some time after a report was spread, that
<hi>Ptolemy Philopater</hi> was dead, which made <hi>Antiochus</hi> to take his way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Egypt,</hi> with design to seize that Kingdom, which the death of that
King might make an easie Conquest. Being at <hi>Ephesus, Hannibal</hi> driven
from <hi>Carthage</hi> by the calumnies of his Enemies, who had accused him to
the Romans, as factious and likely to trouble the Peace now between them,
came to salute him, and offer him his service; and as he had the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65196:40"/>
of a great Captain, the King received him with much<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> kindness,
and kept him near his person. Being gone as far as <hi>Lycia,</hi> he understood
that <hi>Ptolemy</hi> was yet living, whereupon he quitted the design of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
out of hopes that he might easily seize <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and to that intent, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued
for that Island; but was surprized with so furious a Tempest near
the River <hi>Sara,</hi> that he lost a great number of his Ships, and many of his
Friends, Mariners and Soldiers; and the rest of his Fleet being carried by
the Storm to <hi>Seleucia</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> he there caused his Ships to be repaired,
which were much out of order, and celebrated the Nuptials of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Laodice,</hi> whom he had before made enter into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
of Marriage.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> At length having absolutely resolved on a War with the Romans, he
endeavoured to ally himself to the Kings his Neighbours by Marriage. He
sent <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Syra</hi> to <hi>Ptolemy</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and gave her in Dower
the lower<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Or</hi> Coelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syria.</note> 
                  <hi>Syria,</hi> which he had formerly usurped from him, hoping thus
to appease that young man, that he might attempt nothing on that side
during the War. He sent likewise <hi>Antiochida</hi> to <hi>Ariarathes,</hi> King of <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia,</hi>
and the last to <hi>Eumenes,</hi> King of <hi>Pergamus:</hi> But that King know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the design he had of making War upon the Romans, and that it was
only for that end that he sought his Alliance, excused himself; and when
his Brother <hi>Attalus</hi> and <hi>Phileter</hi> wondred that he despised the Alliance of so
great a King his Neigbour, who offered it of himself; he laid before them
the importance of this War, in which possibly in the beginning they might
fight with equal Forces, but that in the end the Romans would prove vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious,
by reason of that courage and generosity, which rendred them
undefatigable. <hi>In which case,</hi> said he, <hi>I shall remain free and secure in my
Kingdom; but if</hi> Antiochus <hi>overcome, 'tis possible so powerful a Neighbo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t me keep them, 'twill be only on
conditions of submission to his Empire.</hi> These were the Reasons why he
would not accept the Match.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Antiochus</hi> being returned to the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> and passed over into
<hi>Chersonesus,</hi> took many places in <hi>Thrace,</hi> either by force or surrender, set

and was extremely liberal to those of<note n="*" place="margin">Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</note> 
                  <hi>Bizantium,</hi> because their City be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
seated at the mouth of the Sea, was very commodious for War; he
likewise by his bounty, and the terror of his Arms, drew the Galatians to
his party, judging those great Bodies were very proper to oppose the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
in a Battel. After this he came to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> whence he Deputed
<hi>Lysias, Eginetes</hi> and <hi>Menippus</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> in effect to pry into the intentions
of the Senate, but in appearance to tell the Fathers: <hi>That always hitherto
he had been affectionate to the Roma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Name, and likewise that he had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to have been received into their Alliance, if they had thought him worthy.
However, he could not but wonder that they should order him to quit the Cities
of</hi> Ionia, <hi>to release to some of them the Tribute they ought him, not to meddle
with the Affairs of</hi> Asia, <hi>and to abandon the Possession of</hi> Thrace, <hi>which he
held of his Ancestors; for that such kind of commands were usually given to
the Conquered, and not to Friends.</hi> The Senate knowing well that these
Ambassadors were only come to sound them, answered in few words, <hi>If</hi>
Antiochus <hi>leave the Asiatique Greeks at liberty, and touches nothing in</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
<hi>he may be, if he pleases, friend of the people of</hi> Rome. This was all
they said, without giving any farther reason to the Ambassadors. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochus</hi>
thereupon designing as soon as he could to seize upon <hi>Greece,</hi> that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65196:40"/>
from thence he might begin the War against the Romans, thought good
to communicate his intentions to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who told him, <hi>That</hi> Greece
<hi>having for a long time been afflicted with War, he thought there would be no
great difficulty in seizing upon it. But that it was hard for a Prince to make
War in his own Country, because of the scarcity of Provisions that might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
but much more easie to maintain it in his Enemies Country: That</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus
<hi>would never attain his desires upon the Romans in</hi> Greece, <hi>considering
the conveniencies they had of supplying themselves with Provisions, and the
faculty of raising Men: He therefore counselled him to si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se on some part of</hi>
Italy, <hi>and make that the seat of the War, whereby the Roman Affairs would,
as well at home as abroad be weakned. I know,</hi> said he, Italy <hi>perfectly well;
and if you will give me but ten tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sand men, dare promise my self to land
and post my self in some place convenient for your designs, from thence I will
write to my Friends in</hi> Carthage, <hi>to engage them to stir up the people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt,
who already of themselves weary of the present Government, preserve
no great fidelity for the Romans, and who out of hopes of a better Fortune,
will attempt any thing as soon as they hear of my return to</hi> Italy. The King
with pleasure listned to this advice; and considering (as true it was)
that the Engagement of the Carthaginians in this War, was of no small
importance, gave him charge to write forthwith to his Friends. However
he writ not, for he could not do it with safety, the Romans having their
Spies every where, and the War not being yet declared: Besides there
were many envious persons in <hi>Carthage,</hi> and that Republick was troubled
with those Divisions, which not long after were the cause of its ruine.
Howbeit, he sent to his Friends a certain Tyrian Merchant, called <hi>Ariston,</hi>
who came to <hi>Carthage,</hi> under pretence of Trade, and by him he desired
them, that as soon as they heard he was entred <hi>Italy,</hi> they should move
the people to revenge the outrages they had received; he acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
very well of his Commission: for <hi>Hannibal's</hi> Enemies knowing of the
coming of this <hi>Ariston,</hi> began to make a great noise, as if he had the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of some contrivance to the prejudice of the Publick, so that
search was made for the Tyrian, and he, that he might not only engage
the Friends of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> fixed up by Night in the Place a certain Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
by which that Captain exhorted all the Senate to joyn with <hi>Antiochus</hi>
for the defence of the Country, and that done, gets him to Sea. Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
being come, and the Writing read, the Friends of <hi>Hannibal</hi> found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by this invention discharged of any suspicion could be had of them,
because it was believed the whole Senate had part in this advertisement.
However the people knew not what to resolve on, they affected not the
Roman Rule, but they had neither the power, nor the boldness to attempt
any thing.</p>
               <p>Mean while the Romans to cry quits with <hi>Antiochus,</hi> sent him likewise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
Embassadors to sound him, and spy into his Forces, of the number of
which was <hi>Scipio</hi> the African. They came to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that he was gone into <hi>Pisidia,</hi> they staid for him, and during his
absence, had several conferences with <hi>Hannibal.</hi> They expostulated with
him, that whilst <hi>Carthage</hi> was in Peace, and <hi>Antiochus</hi> upon the point of
being declared Enemy of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> he had left his Country,
though since the League, neither he nor any other Carthaginian had any
cause of complaint. This was a policy in the Ambassadors, who believed
by these familiarities with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> they might bring him under suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the King, of which, as great a Polititian as he was, he was not at all
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65196:41"/>
aware: But the King being advertised of it, grew jealous of him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided
not in him, as he had done before: but besides his jealousie, <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
grew envious of this great Commander, fearing left, if his Affairs
had success, all the Glory would be attributed to <hi>Hannibal.</hi> One day (as
'tis said) these two excellent men, holding a conference before a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Auditory, fell upon a discourse of great Captains; and <hi>Scipio</hi> having
asked <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who of them all he esteemed to be the greatest? He replied,
<hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Macedon:</hi> To which <hi>Scipio</hi> agreed, because he yielded to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander:</hi>
And thereupon asking again, to whom he gave the second place,
he named <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Epire,</hi> because in his Judgement, Boldness and
Courage were the principal Virtues of a General of an Army, and of all
Kings he had ever heard speak of, he had known none more hardy. <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
approved not this so well, yet he asked him again, To whom he gave the
third place? <hi>To my self,</hi> said he, <hi>for scarce crept out of my Infancy, I made
my self Master of</hi> Spain; <hi>I am the first, after</hi> Hercules, <hi>that hath passed the</hi>
Alps <hi>with an Army; and being entred into</hi> Italy, <hi>have struck a terrour through
all places: I have taken and sack'd four hundred Cities, and all this without
any assistance, either of Men or Money from the Carthaginians.</hi> Here <hi>Scipio</hi>
interrupting these Bravadoes, told him smiling; <hi>And in what degree would
you have placed youy self, if I had not overcome you? I would have then
ranked my self,</hi> said he, <hi>before</hi> Alexander. Thus without diminishing any
thing of his own Glory, he obliged <hi>Scipio</hi> with an ingenious praise, telling
him he had vanquished a Captain greater than <hi>Alexander.</hi> Their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
ended: <hi>Hannibal</hi> prayed <hi>Scipio</hi> to go and lye at his Apartment;
which <hi>Scipio</hi> answered, he would freely have done, had he not been with
<hi>Antiochus,</hi> whom the Romans had a present distrust of. Thus did these
great Captains, by a Generosity worthy of themselves, measure their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
only by the Wars in which they were ingaged. <hi>Flaminius</hi> did not
so, for finding, after the defeat of <hi>Antiochus, Hannibal,</hi> who fled to have
saved himself in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> in the Court of King <hi>Prusias,</hi> where that Roman
was in Embassie upon other Affairs, though he had never received any
particluar offence, nor had any order from the Senate, there being now
no reason to fear him, <hi>Carthage</hi> being subdued; yet he constrained him
to end his days by Poyson. 'Tis said this death had been foretold him
by the Oracle in these terms.</p>
               <q>In the Libyssan land shall Hannibal dye.</q>
               <p>But he himself was deceived, for he hoped to dye in <hi>Libya,</hi> never think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> there was a River called <hi>Libyssa,</hi> which gave name
to the adjacent Country. I have related these Examples, as well of the
Generosity of <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as of the contrary baseness of <hi>Flamini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
because I thought them not unworthy to find a place in this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> To proceed, <hi>Antiochus</hi> upon his return from <hi>Pisidia,</hi> after having given
Audience to the Deputies of the Rhodians, promised to leave in liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
both them, the Byzantines, and all the other Greeks, bordering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Asia,</hi> in case he came to an agreement with the Romans; but would
not grant the same conditions to the Etolians and Ionians, because they had
already been accustomed to the Dominion of the Kings of <hi>Asia,</hi> as bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65196:41"/>
as they were. As for the Roman Ambassadors, they returned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doing any thing; nor indeed came they for any other intent, but to
gain knowledge of the Estate of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Affairs. After their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
came the Deputies of <hi>Etolia,</hi> of whom <hi>Thoas</hi> was the Chief, who
offered the King all the Forces they had, advising him to pass forthwith
into <hi>Greece,</hi> as to an easie Conquest: Telling him, <hi>There was no necessity
he should stay for those Forces that were to come out of the midst of</hi> Asia, <hi>for
the Etolian Powers were more than sufficient, and besides the Lacedemonians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and</hi> Philip <hi>of</hi> Macedon, <hi>sworn Enemy of the Romans, would joyn with him
as soon as he should be entred into</hi> Greece, <hi>but that he could not use too much
diligence, Antiochus</hi> presently took fire, nor could the news brought him
of his Sons being dead in <hi>Syria</hi> hinder his embarquing, but with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men only, he went and landed in the Island of <hi>Euboea,</hi> which he so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
that they yielded to pay him Obedience. <hi>Micithion,</hi> one of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
began likewise prosperously enough; for having found some Romans
in the Island of <hi>Delos,</hi> which is consecrated to <hi>Apollo,</hi> he cut part of them
in pieces, and took the rest Prisoners. <hi>Amynander,</hi> King of the Athama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
joyned himself likewise to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and that for the reason we are
about to relate. A certain Macedonian, called <hi>Alexander,</hi> bred at <hi>Mega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolis,</hi>
to whom the Inhabitants had granted the freedom of becoming a
Burgess of their City, had perswaded them by extravagant lyes, that he
was of the Race of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Son of <hi>Philip;</hi> and to gain the more
credit to his knavery, he called his Children, the one <hi>Philip,</hi> and the other
<hi>Alexander,</hi> and the last, which was a Daughter, <hi>Apamia,</hi> whom he gave in
Marriage to <hi>Amynander, Philip,</hi> Brother to the Maid, and who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
her to her Husband, seeing his weakness and ignorance in Affairs,
had staid with this his Brother-in-law to Govern his Estates, in favour of
the Alliance. <hi>Antiochus</hi> took hold of this occasion, putting this <hi>Philip</hi> in
hopes that he would re-establish him in the Kingdom of <hi>Macedon,</hi> which
belonged to him by Succession from his Ancestors; and by this means he
drew the Athamanians to his party, as he did likewise the Thebans by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Thebes,</hi> where he made an Oration to the people.</p>
               <p>Thus having rashly enough undertook a War of such great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
founded on the assistance of <hi>Anynander,</hi> the Thebans and the Eto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,
he held a Council concerning <hi>Thessaly,</hi> whether he should present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
siese it, or stay till Winter were past. <hi>Hannibal</hi> being at this Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
where he had kept silence till the King desired his advice, then gave
it in these terms.</p>

if there happen to you the least disgrace: Besides we are come hither
without any Forces of our own, perswaded by the Etolians, that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians
and <hi>Philip</hi> will joyn with us; and yet I fear the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians

he should declare for you, I cannot perceive in the condition, wherein

things stand, that it would be of much importance which party he
takes, but I am firm in this judgement, that you forthwith cause your
Troops to come out of <hi>Asia,</hi> without placing your hopes, either upon
the Etolians or <hi>Amynander,</hi> and that as soon as they are come, you enter
<hi>Italy,</hi> that the Romans thereby sufficiently pestered to find remedies for
Domestick mischiefs, may attempt nothing against your Dominions, nor,
fearing to leave home defenceless, permit their Forces to range abroad.
To this purpose you must divide your Fleet into two parts, one of which
may waste the Coasts of <hi>Italy,</hi> whilst the other is kept in readiness, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
some favourable conjuncture. In the mean time you are to post
your self with your Land Army on the Frontiers of <hi>Greece,</hi> near unto
<hi>Italy,</hi> both to hold them always in terrour, and to make an irruption as
soon as you can possibly. Then it will be to some purpose to use all
sorts of means to engage <hi>Philip</hi> to your interests, for which part soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he takes, he will be of no small consequence. And if you cannot
gain him, you must send your Son <hi>Seleucus</hi> to enter his Country with
an Army on the Thracian side, that seeing himself embroiled in
a Domestick War, the Enemy may draw no assistance from
him.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> The Senate receiving advice of this irruption in <hi>Greece,</hi> and of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
of the Romans in <hi>Delos,</hi> declared <hi>Antiochus</hi> Enemy to the Roman
people: And thus after the distrust so long time had on one part and the
other, they came to an open War. But because the King was Possessor of
vast Territories in the Continent, and of almost all the Sea-coasts, that he
was entred into <hi>Europe,</hi> where he had begot a fear of him, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his mighty preparations, as of the Glory of those brave Actions
had gained him the title of Great, the Romans believed that this War
would be of a long continuance; and besides, they were distrustful of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
of <hi>Macedon,</hi> whom they had lately vanquished, and doubtful lest the
Carthaginians should violate the League, because of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who was
with <hi>Antiochus,</hi> they had moreover in suspicion some Provinces newly
conquered, and fearful lest they should make some insurrection, when
they saw <hi>Antiochus</hi> in Arms, wherefore they sent Forces to bridle them
with Garrisons, and with Propretors, who had each of them carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them six Axes, and to whom they gave one half of the Authority
attributed to the Consuls, as they bore half their Ensigns: And because
in this great danger, they were likewise doubtful lest <hi>Italy</hi> should not
prove altogether faithful, or stand stedfast with them against <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
they sent a powerful Army unto <hi>Tarentum,</hi> to hinder the Enemies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
whilst their Fleet coasted round the Country, so much did <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
at first terrifie them. After they thought they had sufficiently se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
Affairs within; they set themselves to levy Soldiers, of whom they
raised twenty thousand in the City, and twice as many in the Cities of their
Allies, with design in the Spring to pass into <hi>Ionia.</hi> Thus they spent the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65196:42"/>
Winter in making their preparations. In the mean time <hi>Antiochus</hi> took
his march towards <hi>Thessaly,</hi> and being come to the place called <hi>Cynocephalos</hi>
or <hi>Dogshead,</hi> he Magnificently buried the bodies of those that had been
slain, which had hitherto lain without Sepulchre, gaining by this means
the good will of the Macedonians, and loading <hi>Philip</hi> with the hatred of
his people, incensed that he had not taken the care to bury the bodies of
those had been slain in his service. <hi>Philip</hi> was yet uncertain what party
he should take, but hearing this news, he streightway preferred the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
and sending for <hi>Bebius,</hi> that commanded the Army, that lay hard
by, took between his hands the Oath of Alliance against <hi>Antiochus. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
praysed him, and henceforward trusted in him, so far that sending
<hi>Appius Claudius</hi> with two thousand Men into <hi>Thessaly,</hi> he made not any
difficulty of causing him to march through the midst of <hi>Macedonia. Claudius</hi>
being come to <hi>Tempe,</hi> nigh <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Camp that besieged <hi>Larissa,</hi>
kindled great fires that he might make the Enemy believe he was come
with a powerful Army. The King did believe it, and perswading him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
it was <hi>Bebius</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> him; Fear made him raise the Siege of
<hi>Larnissa,</hi> and making the season his pretence which began to grow cold,
he went to take up his Winter-quarters at <hi>Chalcis.</hi> Here he fell in love
with a beautiful Virgin, though he were above fifty years old, and Married
her with Great Pomp and Magnificence, without considering he had upon
his hands a War, wherein all his Glory lay at stake. He spent the whole
Winter in pleasure and divertisement, and suffered his Army to do the
like, but having in the first of the Spring made an inroad into <hi>Acarnania,</hi>
he too well perceived that Soldiers accustomed to Idleness were difficultly
retrived, and began to repent of his Marriage, and the delights to
which he had abandoned himself. Not but that he did somewhat in this
Country; Some places submitted to him, and others he took by force, but
having intelligence that the Romans passed the <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea, he returned to
<hi>Chalcis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Army was composed of two thousand Horse, and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/>
Foot, they had likewise some Elephants. It was commanded by
<hi>Manius Acilius Glabrio,</hi> who being passed from<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Or</hi> Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disium.</note> 
                  <hi>Brundusium</hi> into
<hi>Apolonia</hi> took his march towards <hi>Thessaly,</hi> raising in his way, the sieges
from before such Cities as the Enemy had invested, and driving out the
Garrisons from those who had received them, he reduced likewise, that
<hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> who had the forementioned pretensions on the
Kingdom of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and took Prisoners about three thousand of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi>
Souldiers. Mean while <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> made an Irruption into
<hi>Athamania,</hi> and drove thence <hi>Amynander,</hi> who fled, and sheltred himself
in <hi>Ambracia. Antiochus</hi> having intelligence hereof, and seeing so sudden
a change of affairs, began to be afraid of the diligence of his enemies,
and perceived at last that <hi>Hannibals</hi> advice was the best, Wherefore he
dispatched many Messengers one after another to <hi>Polexenidas,</hi> to cause
him to advance, and in the mean while with all expedition possible he
drew together all the force he could make, which amounted to ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Foot and fifteen hundred Horse, with some Auxiliary Troops of his
Allies, and with these went to siese upon the pass of <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> that he
might stop the Enemies passage whilst he expected his Army out of <hi>Asia.</hi>
Now the strait of <hi>Thermopylae</hi> is a long and narrow passage, bounded on
one side with a troublesome and inaccessible Sea, and on the other with a
deep and broad Marish. It hath on both sides two mighty steep Rocks, of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65196:43"/>
which one is called <hi>Tichiontes,</hi> and the other <hi>Callidromos,</hi> where are found
hot Springs whence the place had the Name of <hi>Thermopylae.</hi> Here <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi>
caused to be raised, two walls, and erected Engins upon them,
committing the guard of the tops of the mountains to the Etolians, lest
the Enemy should surprize him by the same windings <hi>Xerxes</hi> had found
out to assault the Lacedemonians and <hi>Leonidas,</hi> because they had left them
unguarded. Having therefore placed a thousand Men, on each top, he
went and encamped with the rest of the Army near <hi>Heraclea. Manius</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
intelligence of the Enemies Posture, caused publication of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
to be made for the morrow, and at the same time sent away two of his
Tribunes <hi>M. Cato</hi> and <hi>L. Valerius</hi> to whom he gave as many chosen Men
as they desired, with Orders in the night to make a turn about the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and if it were possible to drive the Aetolians from their Posts. <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
having assaulted those which had the Guard of <hi>Tichiontes,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed,
for they defended themselves couragiously. But <hi>Cato</hi> having post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself near the <hi>Callidromos,</hi> about the last watch advanced, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
the Enemies, yet asleep; however he had a sharp scuffle, by reason
of the incommodiousness of the place, where the Soldiers were forced to
Scramble up the Rocks, and Precipices to come at the Etolians. Mean
while <hi>Manius</hi> marched directly towards <hi>Antiochus,</hi> having drawn off his
Army into several bodies for he could not fight otherwise in these straits
where the King expected him, having placed his Targets, and light
Armed Foot in the Front of his Phalanx, which he had embatteled before
his Camp, on the right hand stood the Slingers and Archers, who guarded
the Foot of the Mountain, On the left the Elephants, and on the Sea-side,
those Companies appointed for the Guard of his Person. When they were
engaged, <hi>Manius</hi> found himself rudely intreated on all sides, by the
light Armed Soldiers: But bravely sustaining the Shock, and sometimes
giving ground, sometimes returning fiercely to the charge, he harassed
them in such manner, that he put them to the Rout. The Phalanx open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to give them passage, and closing again presented the Romans with an

<hi>Macedon</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> did principally make themselves terrible, for no Man
was so hardy as to press upon this thick and affrightful forrest of Pikes.)
Hereupon on a sudden, might be perceived the Etolians with great crys
flying from the <hi>Callidromos,</hi> and sheltring themselves in <hi>Antiochus</hi> Camp;
which at the instant struck fear into both parties, who knew not what it
meant; but when they knew <hi>Cato</hi> who with loud shouts pursued the
Flyers, and saw him already nigh the Camp, the Kings Soldiers, who had
heard the Roman Courage and Valor largely spoken of, and were sensible
of their own defects and faintness, occasioned by their having spent the
Winter in Pleasures and Idleness, began to be afraid, and their fear blinded
them, so that they could not observe the numbers commanded by <hi>Cato,</hi> but
imagining them far greater then they were, and apprehensive lest they
should Plunder their Camp, they ran thither in disorder, followed so close
by the Romans, that they entred Pelmel with them, and forced them to a
second flight. <hi>Manius</hi> pursued them as far as <hi>Scarphi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

slaughter, took a great number of Prisoners, and at his return from the
chase of the Enemy gave their camp in spoil to his Soldiers. Mean while
the Etolians had siesed the Roman camp, which they found abandoned, but
as soon as they saw <hi>Manius</hi> return they quitted it. It is said that of the
Roman Army there were about two hundred Men slain, either in the fight
or the pursuit, <hi>Antiochus</hi> lost ten thousand reck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="5 letters">

as soon as he saw his Army give way, saved himself with five hundred
Horse, and at one carriere reached <hi>Elatia.</hi> From thence he got to <hi>Chalcis,</hi>
where his Fleet lay, on which he Embarqued with his new Spouse <hi>Eubia</hi>
(for so she was called) and fled to <hi>Ephesus.</hi> Yet he took not with him all
his Ships, for some that were laden with Provision fell into the hands of the
Roman Admiral who sunk them.</p>
               <p>News of this Victory being brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> publick Prayers were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/>
made, all the City rejoycing at the happy beginnings of this War, and in
acknowledgment of <hi>Philips</hi> fidelity they sent back to him his Son <hi>Demetrius,</hi>
who was yet a Hostage in the City. Whilst at <hi>Rome</hi> they were giving
Demostrations of their joy for this happy success, the Phocians, Chalci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
and many other people, who had been of the Kings party, came to ask
pardon of <hi>Manius,</hi> who forgave them. After which he went with <hi>Philip</hi>
to spoil <hi>Etolia,</hi> took all their Cities together with <hi>Damocrites</hi> General of
that Nation (the same <hi>Damocritus</hi> who had threatned <hi>Flaminius,</hi> he would
encamp on the banks of <hi>Tiber.)</hi> After this he took his March towards
<hi>Callipolis,</hi> over Mount <hi>Corax,</hi> which is of a great height, and very difficult
to pass by reason of the Rocks especially for an Army, laden with bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
and the spoils of the Enemy as this was, for in passing this cragged
way many Soldiers with their Arms and Equipage, were lost among the
Precipices, besides they stood in fear of the Etolians, who might have

to <hi>Rome</hi> to desire peace. <hi>Antiochus</hi> in the mean while drew towards the
Sea side with all Expedition possible, all the forces that had been levied in
the Lands under his obedience. He caused likewise a Fleet to be fitted out,
the command of which he gave to <hi>Polexenidas,</hi> who had been banished
from <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and not long after passed into <hi>Chersonesus,</hi> which he forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
a second time, he placed Garrisons in <hi>Sestos</hi> and <hi>Abidos,</hi> by which the
Romans might pass into <hi>Asia.</hi> And having designed <hi>Lysimachia</hi> for his
Principal Magazine, he caused to be brought thither great store of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
and Provision, believing the Romans would soon draw towards him
with great forces both by Sea and Land.</p>

now Consul, and because he was not over expert in the Art of War, they
gave him for Lieutenant <hi>Publius</hi> his brother, who having overcome the
Carthaginians, had brought away the surname of <hi>African</hi> as a spoil.
Whilst these two brothers were laboring in their preparations, <hi>Livius</hi>
who before had Commission to hinder the Enemy, from making any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
in <hi>Italy,</hi> having been sent Successor to <hi>Attilius,</hi> who commanded
the Romans Naval Forces, Embarqued on those Ships he had for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Coasts, together with some sent by the Carthaginians, and
other Allies, and came to the Port of <hi>Pyrae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m,</hi> where <hi>Attilius</hi> having deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
up to him, the command of the Fleet, he took the Sea with four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
and one Ships, all Armed for War followed by <hi>Eumenes,</hi> with fifty
more, the better half of which were likewise Armed. They first made
a descent in <hi>Phocida,</hi> which yet held for the King, but now for fear recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
them, they the day following went forth to fight. For <hi>Polexenidas</hi>
who commanded <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Fleet was coming to meet them with two
hundred Ships much lighter then theirs, which was a great advantage,
for the Romans were not yet perfectly skilled in Sea Affairs. This Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
seeing that two Carthaginian Ships, advanced in the head of the Fleet,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65196:44"/>
sent out three of his against them, which took them both, but empty, for
the Africans had cast themselves into the Sea. <hi>Livius</hi> angry at this affront,
makes a head, and goes to charge the Admiral, they stay for him, and
grapple with him, so that the Ships being now fast to one another, they
fought as if on firm Land; but the Romans being most daring leaped into
the Enemies Ships, and making themselves Masters of them, brought
them into the body of their Fleet, together with the two Carthaginian
Ships had been taken at first. After this Prologue to a Battel, when the
two Fleets came to joyn, the Romans far surpassed their enemies in bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
and strength, but because their Ships were heavier, they could not
reach those of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> when they made their retreat; however they
forced them to fly and save themselves in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and they themselves
went to <hi>Chios,</hi> where joyned with them seven and twenty Auxiliary Ships
of <hi>Rhodes;</hi> The King having heard what passed in this Sea-fight, sent
<hi>Hannibal</hi> into <hi>Syria,</hi> to cause other Ships to come from <hi>Phaenicia</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi>
but at his return the Rhodians gave him chase, and forced him to retreat
into <hi>Pamphilia,</hi> and having taken some of his Ships, kept the rest for a
while blocked up in the Port.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> Mean while <hi>Publius Scipio,</hi> being come into <hi>Etolia</hi> with the Consul
<hi>Manius,</hi> who had delivered up to him the Army, he would not carry the
War from City to City, judging it scarce worth the time, and therefore
permitted the <hi>Etolians</hi> to send again their Deputies to <hi>Rome,</hi> whilst he
chose rather to go directly to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> before his brothers Consulate was
expired. To which end he caused his Army to march by <hi>Macedon</hi> and
<hi>Thrace,</hi> to gain the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> but this way had been very difficult and
troublesome, had not <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> taken order that the Markets
should all the way be supplyed and built Bridges, and brought in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
as he did. This piece of Service was the occasion that the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s,
released him of the rest of the Mony, that he ought, and indeed they had
Orders to that purpose from the Senate in case he served the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
faithfully in that War. They wrote likewise to <hi>Prusias</hi> King of
<hi>Bythinia,</hi> Letters by which they gave him to understand, that the people
of <hi>Rome</hi> had enlarged the Dominions of a great many Kings, their Friends
and Allies, and that though they had overcome <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi>
yet they had left to him his Kingdom, sent back his Son that was in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stage,
and released him the Mony he was still obliged to pay them; with
which things <hi>Prusias</hi> was so much wrought upon, that he presently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into Alliance with the Romans against <hi>Antiochus.</hi> Now the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
<hi>Livius</hi> understanding that the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s were upon their way, left
<hi>Pausimachus</hi> the Rhodian in <hi>Etolia,</hi> with the Rhodian Ships, and a part of the
Roman, and himself with the rest sailed towards the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> to receive
them. In his way <hi>Sestos</hi> and <hi>Rhetia,</hi> and two Ports of the Acheans, and
some other little Towns yielded to him, and because <hi>Abydos</hi> would not do
the same, he layd Siege to it. After <hi>Livius</hi> departure, <hi>Pausimachus</hi>
lying at Anchor near <hi>Samos,</hi> exercised his people, in trying many inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his own, and framing new kinds of Engins, and among the rest
making Iron Pots, filled with combustible stuff, and fastned to the end of
long booms, thrust from the Ships, so that if in time of Service the Enemies
Ships came near them, they might burn them, by letting fall into them,
those flaming Pots. Whilst he busied himself in these sorts of Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Polexenidas</hi> who was likewise of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> but had been banished
thence, was contriving how he might intrap him. He promised him to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65196:44"/>
deliver up to him the Kings Fleet, on condition he would prevail that he
might be recalled from Banishment: <hi>Pausimachus</hi> was jealous of the cheat,
and for a good while stood upon his Guard; but after he had received on
the part of <hi>Polexenidas,</hi> Letters written with his own hand, and had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
that he was gone from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> having sent most of his Mariners to
seek for Provisions, he thought there was no probability, that a man like
him would run the hazard of giving testimony under his own hand against
himself, and began too lightly to give faith to him, and grew negligent of
his Guards; he likewise sent his Seamen to Victual after the others Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
<hi>Polexenidas</hi> seeing his plot took, suddenly caused his men to return,
and privately sent <hi>Nicander,</hi> a famous Pyrate, with some armed Soldiers
into <hi>Samos,</hi> to charge the Enemy behind on the Land side; and he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barquing about midnight, came before day break, and fell upon the Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
and his Companians, who were yet asleep. <hi>Pausimachus</hi> frighted
at this unexpected assault, commanded his Soldiers to dismount from the
Ships, and defend themselves on the Beak: but when <hi>Nicander</hi> came to
charge him behind (perswaded by an errour ordinary in the night) he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the greatest Force had possest themselves of the Shore, and regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Vessels in great disorder, he was the first that made head against
the Enemies, and the first that valiantly fighting was slain; almost all the
rest were slain or cut in pieces: Only seven Ships which carried the Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots,
and which the Enemies durst not approach were saved; the other
twenty were towed, by so many Boats to <hi>Ephesus.</hi> The noise of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
made <hi>Phocea, Samos</hi> and <hi>Cuma</hi> declare for <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and obliged <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi>
who feared lest the Ships he had left in <hi>Aeolida,</hi> might be involved in
the same misfortunes, speedily to return. <hi>Eumenes</hi> came thither also; and
the Rhodians having sent twenty other Ships, in a short time all men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained
courage. To revenge this affront, they presented themselves before
<hi>Ephesus</hi> in order of Battel; but no person coming out to them, they left
one half of their Fleet at anchor, in sight of the City; and with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part, went and made a descent into the Enemies Country, spoiling
the Sea Coasts: but <hi>Nicander</hi> coming suddenly upon them, made them
quit their prize, and flee to their Ships, so that the time of <hi>Livius</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
being expired, they came and disembarqued at <hi>Samos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the same time <hi>Seleucus,</hi> Son of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> forraged the Lands of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,</hi>
and held <hi>Pergamus</hi> so closely besieged, that no person could get out,
so that <hi>Eumenes</hi> was constrained to make all haste possible to <hi>Elea,</hi> which
is the border of his Kingdom, together with <hi>L. Emilius Regulus,</hi> the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
of <hi>Livius.</hi> There came likewise from <hi>Achaia</hi> a thousand Auxiliary
Foot, and a hundred chosen Horse, under the Command of <hi>Diophanes,</hi> who
being entred into <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and perceiving from the Walls the people of
<hi>Seleucus</hi> feasting and making merry, and careless of their Guards, would
have perswaded the Inhabitants to make a Salley upon the Enemies; but
they not having courage enough to adventure it, he drew out what Horse
and Foot they had, and placed them in battalia before the Walls, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
not to move till they had Orders. The Enemy scoffed at the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their number, and their fearfulness: but when he saw them busie
at Dinner, he fell on, and giving the Alarm to their <hi>Corps de Guard,</hi> forced
them to turn their backs, and flee in disorder; some were killed taking up
their Arms, others bridling their Horses, others in running after their
Horses that were got loose, and others, as they strove in vain, to mount
them. Thus <hi>Diophanes</hi> gained a noble Victory in the sight of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
who incouraged him from the Walls, but yet durst not come
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65196:45"/>
forth to second him; and after having slain as many as he could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in so sudden an eruption, he returned into the City with Men and
Horses taken from the Enemy. On the morrow he posted himself in the
same station, without being followed by those of <hi>Pergamus</hi> any more than
the day before. <hi>Seleucus</hi> faced him with some Bodies of Horse, offering
him Battel; but he moved not thereat, kept firm his ground near the
Walls, waiting an opportunity; and when he perceived about noon <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus</hi>
Horsemen were returning to the Camp quite tyred, he furiously
charged them in the Rear, and after having put them to the rout, and
slain some of them, he retreated into the City, he made many such like
attempts, for they could neither go out to Forrage, nor to cut Wood, but
he was still at the backs of them; till at last he harrassed them in such
manner, that <hi>Seleucus</hi> was forced to withdraw his Camp out of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and at last was quite driven out of <hi>Eumenes</hi>'s King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
Sometimes after happened a Sea fight between <hi>Polexenidas</hi> and the
Romans near <hi>Myonesa. Polexenidas</hi> having fourscore and ten Ships of
War, and <hi>Regulus</hi> the Roman Admiral fourscore and three, of which five
and twenty were Rhodians commanded by <hi>Eudorus.</hi> He was appointed
to fight on the left hand; but perceiving that <hi>Polexenidas</hi> was stronger
on the right, and ready to encompass the Romans, he made head with
all his Ships, which were very nimble, and forthwith opposed him, with
those which carried Firebals, so that he durst advance no further for fear
of burning; but as he tack'd, he exposed the broadsides of his Ships to
the Rhodians, who charging upon them, sunk some of them, till such
time as one of the Rhodian Ships having run his Beakhead with such vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
against a Sidonian, that the Anchor fell into the Rhodian, they were
grappled fast together, and now they began a Fight as on firm Land, and
a great number of Vessels thronging in both of one side and the other to
the assistance of these grappled Ships, the Fight was very bloody; but
one half of the Kings Ships being divided from the rest of their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
were oppressed by the Romans before the others perceived it, and
as soon as they saw it, they betook themselves to flight. The King lost
nine and twenty Ships, of which thirteen were taken with all their crew.
The Romans lost only two besides one of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> which <hi>Polexenidas</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with him to <hi>Ephesus.</hi> Thus ended the Sea Fight which was fought near
<hi>Myonesa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> Mean while the King strengthened the <hi>Chersonesus,</hi> and fortified <hi>Lysima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,</hi>
judging well, as true it was, that the Romans would find it difficult
to pass into <hi>Thrace,</hi> without having a firm alliance with <hi>Philip.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of an inconstant Spirit, and variable on matters of no moment, as soon
as he heard of this loss, near <hi>Myonesa,</hi> he began to fear, and believed he had
some God to his Enemy, since all things succeded so ill, that the Romans
were become Masters of the Sea, where he thought he had the greatest
advantage; that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was blocked up in <hi>Pamphilia;</hi> and that <hi>Philip,</hi>
who he thought should have remembred the injuries he had received, did
himself conduct the Enemy through ways inaccessible. Frighted with
all these disorders; and God blinding his judgement, as it happens in
weighty calamities, he most imprudently abandons the <hi>Chersonesus,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
staying so much as for a sight of the Romans, or without either trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
or burning all those Provisions and Munitions he had heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
whether of Corn, Arms, Engines or Money, but leaving them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to the service of his Enemies. Nay, so senceless he was, that when
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65196:45"/>
those of <hi>Lysimachia</hi> went to him weeping with their Wives and Children,
he took no notice of it. He had now no other thoughts but how to hinder
the Romans from entring into <hi>Abidos,</hi> on which he hence forward placed
all his hopes; and yet, as if the Gods had more and more blinded him,
he never took care to guard that passage, nor so much as placed a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
in it, but made a swift retreat into the Inland, designing there to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
the Enemy. The <hi>Scipio's</hi> having intelligence of his departure, made
haste to possess themselves of <hi>Lysimachia;</hi> and having siesed on all the
Treasure and Provisions the King had left in <hi>Chersonesus,</hi> they forthwith
passed the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> which they found defenceless, and overtook <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
at <hi>Sardis,</hi> before he any thing doubted it. This diligence of theirs
so much astonished him, that beginning to torment himself, and making
Fortune a party in the faults he had committed, he presently dispatched
away <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>raclides</hi> the <hi>Bizantine</hi> to the <hi>Scipio's</hi> to treat of Peace, offering
them <hi>Smyrna, Alexandria</hi> upon the <hi>Granick, Lampsacus,</hi> which had been
the cause of their difference, with half the charge of the War. He had
likewise Orders to grant them all the Cities of <hi>Ionia,</hi> and <hi>Aeolia,</hi> which
had held of their party, and in short, whatever they demanded. These
Conditions he was to propose publickly; but in private he had Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to offer to <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> a great sum of Money, with promise to restore
him his Son without Ransom, for the King had taken him prisoner in
<hi>Greece,</hi> as he passed from <hi>Chalcis</hi> to <hi>Demetriade.</hi> This is that <hi>Scipio,</hi> who
afterwards took and demolished <hi>Carthage,</hi> and was the second that bore the
sirname of African. He was the Son of that <hi>Paulus,</hi> who took <hi>Perseus</hi> of
<hi>Macedon,</hi> Grand-child to <hi>Scipio</hi> by the Mother side, she being his Daughter,
and afterwards became his Son by Adoption. The <hi>Scipio</hi>'s made answer
to <hi>Heraclides</hi> in full assembly, <hi>That if</hi> Antiochus <hi>desired Peace, he must not
only quit all Ionique and Eolique Cities, but likewise all</hi> Asia <hi>on that side
Mount</hi> Taurus; <hi>and besides that, pay all the Expence of this War, which had
been begun through his fault;</hi> And in particular <hi>Publius</hi> told the <hi>Byzantine,
That if the King had offered these Conditions, whilst he held</hi> Lysimachia <hi>and
the</hi> Chersonesus; <hi>nay, it's possible before he had passed the</hi> Hellespont, <hi>the
Romans might have accepted them; but seeing he had suffered them to pass,
and that now they beheld themselves Masters, not only of the Bridle, but of
the Horseman, they knew not what else to say to him. However, he was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obliged to him for his kindness, and should be more when he sent him his
Son, but as Affairs at present stood, he advised him, as his friend, to receive
these Conditions e'er something worse befel him.</hi> After this he was carried
sick to <hi>Aelea,</hi> leaving <hi>Cn. Domitius,</hi> Lieutenant to his Brother. As for <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi>
he was of the same opinion <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> had formerly in the
like case been, that though he were absolutely defeated, they could not
demand more, and therefore applied himself to rally his Forces in the
Country of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> very near the Enemy. However, he sent <hi>Scipio</hi> his
Son to <hi>Aelea,</hi> in acknowledgement of which <hi>Scipio</hi> sent him word, by
those which brought him his Son, that he advised him not to give Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
till he was returned to the Army.</p>
               <p>The King perswaded by the Authority of that great Man, went and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/>
near Mount <hi>Sipyle,</hi> where he fortified his Camp with a strong
Wall, and was besides defended by the River <hi>Phrygia,</hi> which parted the
two Armies. This Post he made choice of, that he might not be obliged
to fight against his will. But <hi>Domitius,</hi> covetous of Glory, had a great
desire to fight, whilst he had the Command. He therefore couragiously
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65196:46"/>
passed the River, and came and encamped within<note n="*" place="margin">About two milesand a half.</note> twenty furlongs of the
Enemy, doing all he could for four days together to draw him to a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
he every day drew out his Army before his Trenches, and the other
did the like; but neither the one nor the other would begin the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The fifth day <hi>Domitius</hi> drew forth his Army, and took the Field,
hoping <hi>Antiochus</hi> would come to meet him; but seeing he moved not, he
came and encamped close by him, and having let pass one day more, he
caused it to be published throughout his Army, so loud that the Enemy
might hear it, that on the morrow he would fight, whether <hi>Antiochus</hi>
would or no: This King committed another mighty fault upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
for he might have stood upon the Ditch of his Camp, or have kept
himself within his Trenches, till <hi>Publius</hi> had been recovered: but he
thought it a shame for him to refuse Battel, when he was the strongest; he
therefore prepared himself, and about the last Watch, both Armies took
the Field, and drew up in Array. They were Marshalled in this Order:
<hi>Domitius</hi> placed his right wing, composed of about ten thousand Roman
Foot on the Bank of the River; on the side of them were ten thousand
other Italian Foot, both parties divided into<note n="*" place="margin">Hastati, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe; &amp; Triarii <hi>according to the Roman order.</hi>
                  </note> Vanguard, Battel and Rear. Next
the Italians stood <hi>Eumenes</hi> his Army, and three thousand Acheans armed
with Bucklers. The right Wing composed of the Latin, Roman and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>
his Cavalry, which amounted to about three thousand Horse; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
whose Ranks there were placed some light armed Foot and Archers,
and besides there were four Squadrons, which <hi>Domitius</hi> kept near his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and all these made not above thirty thousand Men; the right Wing
was commanded by <hi>Domitius,</hi> the Battel by the Consul, and the left Wing
by <hi>Eumenes.</hi> They had likewise some Elephants, which were come to
them from <hi>Lybia;</hi> but they believed they should not be able to make use
of them, because they were too few; and besides being small, as all the
Lybian Elephants are, they would be apt to be frightned, when they saw
greater, wherefore they placed them behind in the Rearguard: Such was
the order of the Roman Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antiochus</hi> had an Army of seventy thousand Men, whose main strength
consisted in the Macedonian Phalanx, composed of sixteen thousand Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
which according to the institution of the Ancient Kings, <hi>Philip</hi> and
<hi>Alexander,</hi> were divided into ten Battalia's, each of fifty Ranks, and in
each Rank two and thirty Men: Their Front represented the Walls of a
City, because between every Body stood an Elephant like a lofty Tower;
it was covered on the Flanks with two bodies of Horse, the one of Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
armed at all points, and the other of these chosen Macedonians, whom
they call <hi>Agenia:</hi> In the right Wing were the light armed Soldiers, the
<note n="*" place="margin">Or Horsemen with silver Shields.</note> 
                  <hi>Argyraspides,</hi> and two hundred Archers on Horse-back. In the left
Wing were the Gallograecian Foot, the Tectosages, the Trocmes, the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lostiboges,
some Cappidocians, whom <hi>Ariarathes</hi> had send to the King,
and a great multitude of Mercenaries, which were sustained by other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry,
armed Back and Brest, and by the Band called <hi>Soccale</hi> lightly armed.
Thus had <hi>Antiochus</hi> ordered his Forces, placing his principal confidence,
according to all appearance, in his Cavalry, which in part covered the
Front of his Battel: but he had committed an irreparable fault by having
too closely lock'd up his Phalanx, on which he should have placed his chief
reliance, being all old Soldiers. He had besides all these another Body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of Slingers, Archers, and Men with Darts and Targets of divers
Nations, Phrygians, Lydians, Pamphylians, Cretans, Triballians, Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
armed after the manner of <hi>Crete,</hi> together with Archers on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65196:46"/>
Dacians, Mysians, Elymans and Arabes, who mounted on Dromeda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
extremely swift, vexed the Enemy from above with the shot of their
Arrows, and when they were to fight nigh at hand, made use of long and
narrow Swords. There were some Chariots armed with Scythes, which
were placed in the head of this multitude with Orders to retire, after
having made the first charge. <hi>Antiochus</hi> Army appeared upon a view of
it, to be, as it were, two, the one to assail the Enemy, and the other to
stand their ground, as if they had been an Ambuscade, and certainly both
the one and the other were capable of striking terrour, both for their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and their order. The King was upon the right hand, he gave the left
to his Son, and <hi>Mendis, Zeuxis</hi> and <hi>Philip;</hi> Master of the Elephants, had
the charge of the middle Battel. The day was very misty, so that the
obscurity hindred the Enemies from discovering their Forces; and besides
the moistness slackned the Bow-strings, and made limber and slippery the
Thongs, with which they lanced their Darts; which <hi>Eumenes</hi> having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
found nothing else to be concerned at, his only care was now for the
Chariots, which he extremely feared. He therefore command the Slin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
Darters, and other light armed Soldiers to charge them, and on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
side to throw their Darts and Javelins only at the Horse; for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
once beaten down, the Chariot was useless, or would serve rather to
break the Ranks of their own party, than hurt the Enemy. And indeed
it happened so, for the Chariot-horses being wounded, turned towards
their own Cavalry, so that the Dromedaries that followed the Chariots
were the first broken, then the armed Horsemen who could not shun the
Encounters of the Scythes, by reason of the weight of their Armour: And
thus was the whole Army put into a greater disorder, then there was any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for, or the occasion merited; for it having begun in the middle of the
Field of Battel, spread it self to both ends, and the extent thereof being
large amidst the confu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion of different Voices, and a general fear, those
which were near the danger, sooner felt the blow than foresaw it; and all
the rest were terrified with the expectation of some great mishap. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>
seeing his first onset had succeeded so well, and that the place where
the Chariots and Dromedaries had stood was void, he pressed forward his
Horse, and those of <hi>Italy</hi> against the Galatians, Cappadocians, and other
Mercenaries, crying aloud to his people, that they should go fall upon those
unskilful people, whom their Protectors had forsaken. They obeyed and
charged with so much violence, that they put to flight both them and the
Men of Arms that were behind them, whom the defeat of the Chariots
had already put in disorder, and because the weight of their Arms hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
their saving themselves, they were almost all cut in pieces. Whilst
<hi>Eumenes</hi> thus bore down the Horse in this Wing, <hi>Antiochus</hi> having broke
and put to rout the Legions, gave them chase. Mean while the Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
Phalanx, which stood lock'd up together upon four Fronts in the midst
of the Cavalry, finding themselves opened on all sides, by the flight of the
Wings, opened to receive in the midst of them, some Companies of
light armed Men, who fought at the head of them, and presently closed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
And now <hi>Domitius</hi> easily encompassed the Macedonians, thus clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
together, with his Horse and light armed Foot, and shrewdly annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, for they could neither come to the charge, nor enlarge themselves,
and their experience stood them in no stead at this close order, but rather
exposed them to the Darts of their Enemies: All they could do was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
their Pike heads to the Romans, provoking them to come to the push,
otherwise threatning they would come to them; but being on foot, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65196:47"/>
heavily armed, they durst not go to assault Horsemen, for fear of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Order of their Phalanx, which they could very hardly recover. The
Romans pressed not too close upon these old Soldiers, thus lock'd together,
and exasperated by despair; but wheeling about them, they charged them
at distance with Arrows and Darts, of which not any fell without execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
because they being so hudled together, could not shun them: seeing
themselves harassed in this manner, and not knowing what course to take,
they gave ground, but still retreating, and not breaking their Order, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that the Romans durst not yet draw near, but were satisfied to
charge them at distance, till such time as the Elephants, which they had
placed between the Battalia's, began to break their Ranks, and refusing
any more to obey their Rulers, caused the whole multitude to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to flight in disorder. <hi>Domitius</hi> having routed the Phalanx, attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to force <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Camp, whilst he continued driving the Legions
that were opposed to him unto their very Camp, they not being support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by any Horse, nor any Darters, nor Slings; for <hi>Domitius</hi> had placed
none in this Wing, believing it sufficiently defended by the River. But the
King being repulsed by the Tribune, that had the charge of the Guard
of the Camp, who sallied out with some fresh Forces, and caused those
that fled to return to the charge, turned head, puffed up with an opinion
of the Victory, because he knew not what had passed elsewhere. <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talus,</hi>
Brother to <hi>Eumenes,</hi> advanced to encounter him with a Body of
Horse, of which the King made so light off, that he charged through and
through, without receiving any great damage. But when he came to
have knowledge of the defeat, by the slaughter of his people, with whom
all the Field of Battel was covered, seeing the vast heaps of Bodies, Men,
Horses and Elephants, confusedly mixed together, and that even his Camp
was in the Enemies power; he likewise betook himself to flight, and all
upon the spur made for <hi>Sardis,</hi> whither he reached about midnight. From
<hi>Sardis</hi> he presently took the way towards <hi>Celenes,</hi> which men call <hi>Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi>
whither he had understood his Son was escaped. On the morrow
he departed from <hi>Celenes</hi> towards <hi>Syria,</hi> leaving his Captains to rally the
ruines of his Army; and in the mean time sent Ambassadors into the Field
of Battel, to demand peace of the Consul, who was then burying the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of his dead, spoiling those of the Enemy, and gathering together the
Prisoners. Among the Dead, there were found about four and twenty
Roman Knights, and about three hundred Footmen, who had been slain
by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and of <hi>Eumenes</hi> Soldiers only fifteen Horsemen: As for
the Enemy, they lost fifty thousand men, comprizing the Prisoners, for
the number of the dead was so great, it could scarcely be counted. All the
Elephants fell upon the place, save only fifteen, which were taken alive.
After this Victory so great, that many could scarce believe it; for they
could not imagine that a handful of men fighting in an Enemies Country
could possibly defeat such a prodigious Army of the Kings, and especiall
of the Macedonian Phalanx, composed all of old Soldiers, now stronger in
men than ever, and believed invincible; after this Victory, I say, <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
his Friends blamed his rashness for having undertaken this War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Romans, and said that from the beginning he had made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that he was no great Captain, having so inconsiderately abandoned
<hi>Lysimachia,</hi> and the <hi>Chersonesus;</hi> and besides that, withdrawn the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
from the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> by means of which he might have hindred the
<hi>Scipio's</hi> from passing into <hi>Asia:</hi> And at last they condemned his impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for imprisoning, as it were, the choice Forces of his Army, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65196:47"/>
rendring them useless, and placing his hopes in a heap, and multitude
of new leavied Soldiers, rather then in men accustomed by long exercise
to the toils of War, and whose bodies and courages were both invincible.
Whilst all the world talked in this manner of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the Romans grown
more resolute then before, now began to think nothing impossible, founding
their thoughts, as well upon their native valor, as upon the assistance of
the Gods, and not being able sufficiently to admire their own good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
when they considered how being so infinitely unequal in number,
and in a strange Country, they had in one only battel, and in one day sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
so many Nations, made prize of so great Riches, overcome so many
Mercenary Troops, quell'd the glory of the Macedonians, and in short
ruined <hi>Antiochus,</hi> King of so many Kingdoms, and reduced him that had
gained the Surname of Great, to a by-word, and a Proverb of Antiochus
<hi>the Great has been.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whilst the Romans entertained themselves, with these pleasant thoughts,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/>
Publius <hi>brother to the Consul, finding himself in a condition to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
a journey, came to the Camp, where the Kings Deputies had Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
They now only desired to know what</hi> Antiochus <hi>must do, that he
might be received into the friendship of the Senate and People of</hi> Rome,
<hi>to which</hi> Publius <hi>answered.</hi> That this War was not begun, but through the
fault and covetousness of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who possessing a great Empire, of which
the Romans were not at all jealous, not therewith content, had despoiled <hi>Ptolemy</hi>
his kinsman, and friend to the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> of the lower <hi>Syria,</hi> had invaded
<hi>Europe</hi> without any right, subdued <hi>Thrace,</hi> fortified the <hi>Chersonesus,</hi> and
built <hi>Lysimachia.</hi> In conclusion having brought an Army into <hi>Greece,</hi> had
endeavored to reduce under servitude the Greeks whom the Roman People had
lately set at liberty and continued his enterprizes, till such time as he was
defeated at <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> That though he had been forced to save himself by
flight, he had abated nothing of his Ambition: but had renewed the War by
Sea, where he had been beaten in several Engagements, and had never made
any Overture of Peace till the Roman Army was come over into <hi>Asia.</hi> That
even then he had proudly refused their conditions, and setting on Foot a
mightier Army to make yet greater attempts was fallen into an Extremity of
Disgrace. But <hi>(said he)</hi> though with reason we may impose on him a
greater penalty, after so much obstinacy, we will not use our good fortune in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solently,
nor insult on others calamities. We offer you therefore the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
we did before, adding only some small matter advantagious to both,
and of importance to the common security. Renounce <hi>Europe,</hi> Quit to us all
<hi>Asia</hi> as far as <hi>Mount Taurus,</hi> Deliver into our hands all your Elephants,
and as many Ships as we shall order you to furnish. You shall henceforth
keep no Elephants, and only such a Number of Ships as we shall prescribe.
You shall give up twenty Hostages, such as the Consul shall choose, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Expence of the War you shall pay fifty Talents ready Mony, and
two thousand five hundred after the Senate shall have ratified the Peace, with a
thousand Talents to be for twelve years to come, yearly sent to <hi>Rome.</hi> You
shall likewise deliver to us all Prisoners and Runaways, and pay unto <hi>Eumenes</hi>
the Remainder of what was due to his Father. If <hi>Antiochus</hi> presently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
these Articles, we will grant him Peace, and promise him the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Roman People; Provided the Senate approve it. <hi>The Deputies
having accepted these conditions, part of the mony was soon brought, and
the Hostages delivered, among which was the Kings youngest Son called</hi>
Antiochus, <hi>which done the <hi>Scipio's</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> sent their Deputies to</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:65196:48"/>
Rome. <hi>The Senate ratified the Treaty, and the Articles were signed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to</hi> Scipio<hi>'s intentions, however somethings were added not before
expressed.</hi> That the bounds of <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Dominion should be the two
Promontories, called <hi>Calecadnon</hi> and <hi>Sarpedonion,</hi> beyond which he was not to
bear Arms. That he should have only twelve Ships of War to keep his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in awe, but that if he happened to have any War, he might then have
more, that he should not leavy any Mercenary Soldiers in the Lands under the
Roman obedience, nor receive any Runaways, and that from three years to
three years he should exchange the Hostages save only <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Son. <hi>This
League was Engraven on a Table of Copper, and set up in the Capitol as
other Articles of Peace with any Nation were used to be: an extract of
which was sent to</hi> Manius Volson, <hi>who being at</hi> Apamia <hi>a City of</hi> Phrygia
<hi>took before</hi> Antiochus <hi>Deputies the Oath of Alliance, as</hi> Antiochus <hi>on
his part swore to observe it in the presence of the Tribune</hi> Thermus, <hi>sent to
him for that purpose. Thus ended the War between</hi> Antiochus <hi>the Great,
and the People of</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>Some were of opinion it proceeded no farther, because of the favour
shewed by the King to <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Son, and indeed at his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> they
endeavored to trouble him about it, and the two Tribunes of the People
accused him of having been corrupted by presents to betray the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
But he made slight of his accusers, and his Tryal happening to be
assigned on the same day, that he had gained his Victory over the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,
he sent before hand to the Capitol, all things necessary for a
Pompous Sacrifice, and presented himself before the Judgment Seat, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificently
habited, and not in Mourning like others accused of any
crime, to move their Judges to compassion. This brave Man secured by
the Testimony of his own Conscience, amazed all the world by this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Conduct, for when he began his Discourse, he made no mention of
any crime, he spoke only of the Carriage of his Life past, the mighty
things he had done for the Commonwealth, and the many Victories he had
gained, and he uttered it with so good a grace as delighted the whole
Auditory, but when he came to speak of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which he had subdued,
he amplified the matter with so much heat, that he not only moved, but
warmed the People, by telling them, <hi>This is the day, Gentlemen, whereon
I defeated the Carthaginians whom once you so much feared: Wherefore I am
going from this place to sacrifice at the Capitol, whoever loves his Country, let
him follow, and go with me to return thanks to the Gods.</hi> Having said
these words he mounted to the Capitol, without concerning himself at the
Judgment. All the People followed him, and the Judges themselves ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
him, beseeching the Gods that his Sacrifice might prove accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
This proceedure left his accusers in a deep perplexity; for they durst
no more call to judgment or accuse of ambition or corruption a Man
whose whole behaviour was exempt from suspicion and above calumny.
Thus nobly did he scorn an accusation, had no agreement with his past
life; In which in my opinion he acted more prudently then <hi>Aristides</hi> accused
of Theft, or <hi>Socrates</hi> when imprisoned for the matters objected against them,
who suffered under the infamy without making defence for themselves. It
is true, <hi>Plato</hi> attributes a certain Plea to <hi>Socrates,</hi> which he had framed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own fansie. In my Judgment likewise he repelled Calumny
with more generosity then <hi>Epaminondas</hi> the Sovereign Magistrate of the
Boeotians with <hi>Pelopidas</hi> and another, his Colleagues. The Thebans ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sentthese Captains with their Forces to assist the Arcadians and Messe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65196:48"/>
against those of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and the War not being yet finished as
they would have had it, they recalled them because of some Calumnies:
but they kept for six Months more the Command of the Army, refusing to
surrender it into their hands were sent to succeed them, till such time as
they had driven out the Lacedemonian Garrisons, from the Cities they
held, and placed Arcadians in them. <hi>Epaminondas</hi> had been the sole cause
of this, having promised his Colleagues, that they should fall into no
danger. But as soon as they were returned to the City, their accusers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
them each apart to have them condemned to death; for by their
Laws it was a Capital Crime to hold by force the Command of the Army,
when another was sent to be General. The other two were discharged
not so much out of any compassion the Judges had for them, as because
they laid the whole fault upon <hi>Epaminondas</hi> who had advised them so to do,
and did consent to what they had said. He therefore being last of all called
in Judgement, <hi>I confess</hi> (said he) <hi>that I have kept the Command of the
Army beyond the time prescribed by the Law's, and have constrained my Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues,
whom you have absolved to do the same, I therefore beg no favor from
you: I only desire that for my past services it may be writ upon my Tomb.
Here lies he who having gained the Victory at</hi> Leuctra, <hi>led to the very Walls
of</hi> Sparta <hi>his fellow Citizens, in whom before the only sight of the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
Hats struck a terror: His Country condemned him to death, because he
had less consideration for the Laws then for the Publick good.</hi> After ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
said these words, he descended from the Tribunal offering his body
to any that would lead him to Execution, but the Judges touched with
this reproach, and admiring this manner of defence, changed their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of condemning him as Criminal into Respect, and without putting it to
Vote withdrew from the Assembly. Let every Man judge of these Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
as he pleases.</p>

to submit. They gathered together upon <hi>Olympus</hi> a Mountain of <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
whither he followed them with great labor, and having overtaken
them, put them to the Rout, kill'd an infinite number, and drove others
down the precipices insomuch that the slaughter was so great it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to reckon the dead, because of their Numbers: he took forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Prisoners, whose Arms he caused to be burnt, and because he could
not carry along with them so great a Number of Captives, he sold them to
the Neighboring Nations. The Tectosages, and the Trocmes to revenge
their Nation, laid an Ambush for him, and charged him so furiously that
with great difficulty he saved himself, but soon after finding them lying as
it were heaped upon one another, by reason of their great Numbers, he
caused them to be encompassed by his light Armed Soldiers, who at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
discharging at them a shower of Arrows, not one fell without Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
which made so horrible a Butchery, that after the death of eight

<hi>Ariarathes</hi> King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> who had taken part with <hi>Antiochus,</hi>

head towards the <hi>Hellespout</hi> with vast Riches, innumerable sums of Mony,
an infinite of Spoils and Plunder, and an Army loaden with great quantity
of Baggage. But now he committed a great fault, that he would not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

it was Summer time, take his passage by Sea, not considering the vast
weight of their Equipage; For it was not now his business to harden the
Soldiers by labor, since he was not going to War, but returning home
loaden with spoils. And yet he chose rather to lead his Army by the way
of <hi>Thrace</hi> which is long, crooked and craggy, and that in the violent heat
of Summer, and without giving any advice thereof to <hi>Philip,</hi> that he
might have come out to meet and be his Conductor, nor did he divide his
Forces into many Bodies, for the more commodiousness of the March, and
better supply of things necessary, nor distributed the baggage by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
that it might have been the better guarded, but he made all his Army
file off, in the midst of which came the Carriages, which neither the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
nor Rear could relieve, because the way was long and narrow, by
which means the Thracians falling in on all sides, and charging them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly
he lost a great part of his Prey, Mony and Soldiers, and hardly
saved the rest in <hi>Macedon,</hi> which made appear of what importance <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi>

the Government of <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Timarchus,</hi> and the Superintendancy
of his Revenues to <hi>Heraclides</hi> two brothers, whom he had abused. He
undertook likewise a War against <hi>Artaxias</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and having
taken him Prisoner, died, leaving for his Successor his Son <hi>Antiochus</hi> but
nine years old, to whom the Syrians gave the name of <hi>Eupator,</hi> because of
the Vertue of his Father, and appointed <hi>Lysias</hi> for his Tutor or Governor.
The Senate received with great satisfaction, the news, that <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:65196:49"/>
who had resigned some years gloriously, was so soon dead; and when <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi>
the Son of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> Brother to <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> Grandchild to
<hi>Antiochus</hi> the Great, and Cousin to the Infant, represented at <hi>Rome,</hi>
(where he yet remained as Hostage, being about twenty three years of
age) that he was next Heir to the Crown, they refused to let him
go, because they believed it more advantagious to the people of
<hi>Rome</hi> to have <hi>Syria</hi> governed by a Child than a Man. And having
understood likewise, that there were some Elephants in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and some Ships above the number agreed on with <hi>Antiochus;</hi>
they sent Commissioners to cause the Elephants to be killed, and the Ships
to be burnt; the sight of this Execution begot compassion in all the World,
who thought it cruelty to kill Beasts so tame and so rare, and to burn such
Ships, and so much spleen did it raise up in one <hi>Leptines,</hi> that meeting
<hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Octavius</hi> in a place of Exercises, as he was causing himself to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,
he killed that Commissioner, whom <hi>Lysias</hi> caused to be interred.
<hi>Demetrius</hi> having advice hereof, went to the Senate, and demanded that at
least they would discharge him from the conditions of a Hostage, since he
had been exchanged for <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who was dead; but not being able to
obtain any thing, he secretly escaped by a small Vessel into <hi>Syria,</hi> where
he was received with a general approbation of all the World. He present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put <hi>Lysias</hi> to death, and soon after the Infant, forced <hi>Heraclidos</hi> to flee,
and executed <hi>Timarchus</hi> as a Rebel, having accused him for ill manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Government of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Wherefore he was called <hi>Demetrius</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Or Saviour.</note> 
                  <hi>Soter,</hi> a name given him by the Babylonians. After this, seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
setled in the Kingdom, he sent to <hi>Rome</hi> a Crown of Gold worth ten
thousand Crowns, as an acknowledgement of his having been civily treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in quality of a Hostage; and moreover, delivered to them <hi>Leptines,</hi> who
had slain <hi>Octavius.</hi> The Senate accepted the Crown, but as if the crime
had concerned all the Syrians, they would not content themselves with the
punishment of <hi>Leptines.</hi> After this, <hi>Demetrius</hi> drove <hi>Ariarathes</hi> out of
the Kingdom of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and received a thousand Talents for setling in
it <hi>Holophernes,</hi> said to be his Brother, though it were the Romans inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that both Brothers should be Kings alike: but sometime after they
were both expelled, and <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> likewise by the Forces of <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> upon which cause with some others began the
War with <hi>Mithridates.</hi> Never was there a greater, nor in which there
were so many strange revolutions, or so many Nations concerned; besides
that it lasted forty years, during which time, the Palace of the Kings of
<hi>Syria</hi> oft-times changed its Master, though they were still of the same
Race. There happened likewise during that time, many broils and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
in divers Kingdoms. The Parthians, who for a long time had been
revolted from the Family of the <hi>Seleucides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> added to their Estates <hi>Mesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia,</hi>
which they cut off from the Kingdom of <hi>Syria<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tigranes,</hi> Son
of<note n="*" place="margin">This <hi>Tigranes</hi> had a Son also called Tigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> 
                  <hi>Tigranes,</hi> having subdued the neighbouring Nations, which had eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one their King, and causing himself to be called King of Kings, made
War upon the <hi>Seleucides,</hi> who would not submit. And <hi>Antiochus,</hi> sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
the Pious, being not able to resist him, he became Master of all the
Provinces of <hi>Syria</hi> on this side <hi>Euphrates,</hi> as far as <hi>Egypt,</hi> and of <hi>Cilicia</hi>
besides, which was likewise under the Dominion of the <hi>Seleucides. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabates</hi>
commanded in the name of the King his Master in all their Estates
newly conquered, with a powerful Army for fourteen years together; but
after that <hi>Mithridates</hi> overcome by <hi>Lucullus,</hi> sought refuge in the Court of
<hi>Tigranes. Magabates</hi> went with his Army to the assistance of his King,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65196:50"/>
and in the mean time <hi>Antiochus,</hi> Son of the Pious, retook Possession of
his Kingdom, with applause of all <hi>Syria. Lucullus,</hi> who waged the first
War with <hi>Tigranes,</hi> and drove him out of his new Conquests, disturbed
not the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> in the Possession of the Kingdom of his Fathers;
but <hi>Pompey,</hi> Successor to <hi>Lucullus,</hi> after having defeated <hi>Mithridates,</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
<hi>Tigranes</hi> to remain King of <hi>Armenia;</hi> but for <hi>Antiochus,</hi> though he
had never disobliged the Romans, yet he despoiled him of his Kingdom, and
indeed it was easie for a great Army to oppose a King unarmed: not but
that he had another pretence, for 'twas alledged, that it was not just that
<hi>Syria,</hi> whose Kings of the Seleucian Race were expelled by the Arms of
<hi>Tigranes,</hi> should rather return to them again, than to the Romans, who
were Conquerers of the same <hi>Tigranes</hi> himself. Thus were <hi>Cilicia, Syria</hi>
as well the higher as lower, <hi>Phaenicia</hi> and <hi>Palestine</hi> added to the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
without fighting, and with them all the Countries between <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi>
and <hi>Egypt.</hi> There remained only the Jews to be subdued by force,
and <hi>Pompey</hi> performed it, sent their King <hi>Aristobulus</hi> Prisoner to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and rased the Walls of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> a very great and a holy City in that
Country. <hi>Ptolemy</hi> the first King of <hi>Egypt</hi> had before done the same: <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasian</hi>
likewise took and pillaged it; and the last time it was taken, was by
<hi>Adrian</hi> in our days, wherefore the Jews pay more Tribute by the Pole,
than for the Goods which they posses, and for the Syrians and Cilicians
they pay the hundredth part <hi>Pompey</hi> having conquered all the Nations that
had been formerly under the <hi>Seleucides,</hi> gave to some particular Kings, as
also to the Gallogreeks of <hi>Asia;</hi> and for the others, he confirmed in their
Tetrarchies the Ancient Kings that had faithfully served the Romans in
the War against <hi>Mithridates.</hi> Some years after all these Estates were
reunited to the Roman Empire, every one in his time, but the principal
part under the Empire of <hi>Augustus Caesar.</hi> Now <hi>Pompey</hi> being departed
from <hi>Syria,</hi> left his Government to his <hi>Quaestor Scaurus,</hi> to whom the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
sent <hi>Marcus Philippius</hi> for Successor, and after him <hi>Marcellinus Lentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
both these Praetors, who during the two years that each had the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Province, were obliged several times to come to blows with
the neighbouring Arabs, who made incursions into the Province, wherefore
afterwards there were Proconsuls sent into <hi>Syria,</hi> who had the same power
with the Consuls in matters of War. <hi>Gabinius</hi> was the first that came with
an Army, when <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of <hi>Parthia,</hi> driven from his Kingdom by
<hi>Orodes</hi> his Brother, was re-established by the assistance of the Arabs. At
the same time <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> the Eleventh King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> being expelled like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by his Subjects, by force of Money prevailed with <hi>Gabinius</hi> to reset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and suspend the War with <hi>Parthia.</hi> He did it, and
by force constrained the Alexandrians to return to the obedience of their
King. But <hi>Gabinius</hi> was by the Senate condemned to banishment; for
having without express Orders passed into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and having undertaken
a War which was thought to be unfortunate, being forbid by the <hi>Sybills</hi>
Verses. To <hi>Gabinius</hi> succeeded (as I think) <hi>Crassus,</hi> who going to make
War with the Parthians was defeated by the loss of his whole Army. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him <hi>L. Bibulus</hi> had this Government, during whose time the Parthians
made an irruption into this Province, and in the time of <hi>Saxa,</hi> who was
his Successor, extended their Arms as far as <hi>Ionia,</hi> the Romans being then
diverted by the Civil Wars. But we shall more amply treat of all these
Matters in the Book of the Wars against the Parthians, this being only
designed for the Wars in <hi>Syria.</hi> What therefore I have said, is only to make
known in what manner <hi>Syria</hi> came under the Roman Dominion, and how it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65196:50"/>
was reduced under the form of a Province. Nor will it be much from the
purpose to insert something of what passed from the time of the Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
till it was brought under the Roman Rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> having overcome the Persians, was King of <hi>Syria<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/>
only of <hi>Syria,</hi> but also of all the Countries, whither he carried his Arms.
After the death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> who left two Sons, the one yet a little Infant,
and the other in the belly of his Mother. The Macedonians pressed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
by the love they bore to the Blood of <hi>Philip,</hi> chose for their King <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridaeus</hi>
the Brother of <hi>Alexander,</hi> who yet was not esteemed over wise,
changing the name of <hi>Aridaeus</hi> into that of <hi>Philip;</hi> but that only for the
that <hi>Alexanders</hi> Children were in their minority, for they gave Guards to
the Mother, whilst she was great with Child. Mean while the Captains
of the Macedonians, and principally <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> under the authority of this
<hi>Philip,</hi> divided the conquered Nations into Satrapies or Governments, and
the Brother and Children of <hi>Alexander,</hi> being sometime after dead, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trapes
or Governours, became Kings. <hi>Laomedon</hi> was the first that was
placed in the Government of <hi>Syria,</hi> by the favour of <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> and of
<hi>Antipater,</hi> who after <hi>Perdiccas</hi> had the Government of the Kingdom. As
soon as he had taken possession, <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> who was Governour of <hi>Egypt</hi> came
into <hi>Syria</hi> with a Fleet, and offered this Governour a great sum of Money to
put it into his hands, that it might serve as a Rampier to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that
from thence he might invade <hi>Cyprus.</hi> But not able to obtain any thing that
way, he took <hi>Laomedon</hi> himself Prisoner, who afterwards corrupting his
Guards, fled to <hi>Alcetas</hi> in <hi>Caria.</hi> Thus <hi>Ptolemy</hi> siesed upon <hi>Syria,</hi> where
having staid for some time, he left Garrisons, and returned into <hi>Egypt:</hi> As
for <hi>Antigonus,</hi> he was Governour of <hi>Phrygia, Lycia</hi> and <hi>Pamphilia;</hi> and
besides, when <hi>Antipater</hi> went into <hi>Europe,</hi> he left him superintendent
General of all <hi>Asia:</hi> So that <hi>Eumenes,</hi> Governour of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
Enemy of the Macedonians, he went and besieged him, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that he had made a private escape from the place, pursued him,
and slew him in the way to <hi>Media,</hi> whither he had designed to flee for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge:
from whence returning to <hi>Babylon,</hi> he was magnificently received
by <hi>Seleucus,</hi> then Governour there. But <hi>Seleucus</hi> having condemned to
death one of his Captains, without acquainting him with it, he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of him an account of the Publick Moneys, which so much perplexed <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus,</hi>
that not able to resist <hi>Antigonus,</hi> he retired to <hi>Ptolemy</hi> into <hi>Egypt.
Antigonus</hi> hereupon deposed <hi>Blitor,</hi> Lieutenant Governour of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi>
from his charge, because he had assisted <hi>Seleucus</hi> in his retreat. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he reduced under his obedience the Province of <hi>Babylon, Mesapotamia,</hi>
and all the Nations from <hi>Media</hi> to the <hi>Hellespont;</hi> insomuch, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Governours not enduring he should siese on so many Countries to
their prejudice, entred into a League against him. <hi>Seleucus</hi> was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Author of it; and <hi>Ptolemy; Lysimachus,</hi> Governour of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and
<hi>Cassander,</hi> who commanded in <hi>Macedon</hi> after the death of his Father,
signed to it. They forthwith sent Deputies to <hi>Antigonus</hi> to demand the
restoration of those Lands he had siesed on, and to produce the publick
Moneys to be divided amongst them: He made a mock of the Deputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whereupon the Confederates declared War against him. This no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
daunted him; but on the contrary, he beat out those Garrisons
<hi>Ptolemy</hi> had placed in <hi>Syria,</hi> and made himself Master of <hi>Phaenicia,</hi> and
lower <hi>Syria,</hi> till then under the obedience of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Thence he went to
the Cicilian Ports, leaving <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Son, only two and twenty years
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65196:51"/>
of age, in <hi>Gaza,</hi> with an Army to oppose the designs of <hi>Ptolemy:</hi> but
<hi>Ptolemy</hi> defeated him in a great Battel, and forced him to flee to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>Seleucus</hi> was presently sent by the Confederates to <hi>Babylon,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posses
himself of his Government: <hi>Ptolemy</hi> having to this effect given
him a thousand Foot, and three hundred Horse; this was a Body utterly
uncapable of forcing so great a City, but the inclinations the Babylonians
had for him, made him be received, and his Forces soon increased prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously.
<hi>Antigonus</hi> incensed against <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> overcame him in a Sea Fight,
which was fought near the Island of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where his Son <hi>Demetrius</hi>
commanding, the Army were so puft up with this Victory, that they
proclaimed both Father and Son Kings. It is true, there was no person left
of the Blood Royal, <hi>Aridaeus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Philip</hi> being dead, as were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>Olympia's,</hi> and the Children of <hi>Alexander. Ptolemy</hi>'s Army here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
gave him likewise the Title of King, lest his loss should make him
seem to yield to the Victor. Thus different success occasioned the like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.
The others presently followed the Example, and of Governours
made themselves Kings. Thus <hi>Seleucus</hi> became King of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
killing afterwards with his own hand in combat, <hi>Nicator,</hi> whom <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi>
had placed in the Government of that Province; he had afterwards
many Wars, as well against the Macedonians as the Barbarians, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the others two against the Macedonians. The last of which was
against <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> King of <hi>Thrace;</hi> and the first against <hi>Antiochus,</hi> then
fourscore years old, when the Battel was fought near <hi>Ipsa,</hi> a City of
<hi>Phrygia,</hi> where that brave old Man discharging the part of a General and
Soldier together, lost his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVIII"/> After his death the Confederate Kings divided amongst them his Estates,
of which <hi>Seleucus</hi> had for his share all those Lands that lie between <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi>
and the Sea, and from the Sea as far as <hi>Phrygia</hi> in the main Land,
which vastly augmented his Dominion. And he moreover losing no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of making himself greater, being equally powerful in Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and Arms, conquered <hi>Mesopotamia, Armenia,</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<hi>Seleucidia;</hi> and besides those became Master of the Persians, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
Bactrians, Arabs, Tapyrians, Sogdiens, Arachoses, Hyrcanians, and
other Nations, fronting upon the River <hi>Indus,</hi> which had been subdued by
<hi>Alexander.</hi> So that, except that King, no Prince ever possessed so great a
Country in <hi>Asia;</hi> for all the Lands, from the confines of <hi>Phrygia</hi> to the
River <hi>Indus,</hi> were under his obedience. He went likewise to make War
with <hi>Androcotes,</hi> King of the Indians, that inhabit beyond the River, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
not till an Alliance was contracted between them, which was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Peace. True it is, that whilst <hi>Antigonus</hi> lived, he possessed but some
part of this, for the greatest share came to him after his death. They
say that being in <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Army, in his expedition into <hi>Asia,</hi> and yet
but a private Soldier, he consulted the Oracle of <hi>Didymea,</hi> concerning his
return, to which he was answered, <hi>Take leave of</hi> Europe <hi>and possess</hi> Asia.
That in <hi>Macedon,</hi> there of a sudden appeared on his Fathers Hearth a
great flame, which no body was seen to kindle, and that his Mother was
advertised in a Dream, to give the first Ring she should find to <hi>Seleucus</hi>
to wear; for that he should Reign in that place, where by chance he let
it fall, and that she found one of Iron, with an Anchor engraven thereon,
which was lost about <hi>Euphrates.</hi> 'Tis said likewise, that as he walked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Babylon,</hi> he stumbled upon a stone, which having caused to be taken
up, there was found an Anchor underneath, which troubled much the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65196:51"/>
Southsayers, who would have had this Prodigy to be a presage of delay:
But <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> the Son of <hi>Lagus,</hi> who accompanied him, said it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a sign of stedfastness, wherefore when <hi>Seleucus</hi> attained to the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
he bore an Anchor engraven in his Ring. Some likewise have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
us that whilst <hi>Alexander</hi> was yet living, and in his presence there
happened another presage of the future greatness of <hi>Seleucus;</hi> for after
he was returned from the Indies, being embarqued upon the <hi>Euphrates</hi> to
go visit the Marshes of <hi>Babylon,</hi> with intent to make Channels to water the
Champion of <hi>Syria;</hi> his Diadem was by the wind carried of his Head,
and set upon a heap of Reeds, near the the Sepulcher of an Ancient
King, by a fatal presage of the death of that Prince, which happened soon
after. Whereupon a Mariner casting himself into the Water, and having
taken up the Diadem, put it on his Head, and brought it drie to <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
who for a reward gave him a Talent of Silver. The Divines told
him he should put this man to death, some say he did it, others deny it;
and others again say, it was not at all a Mariner, but <hi>Seleucus</hi> himself,
who cast himself into the Water, and put the Diadem on his Head for
fear of wetting it, and that the presage was fulfilled in the persons of
them both: <hi>Alexander</hi> dying at <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Seleucus</hi> succeeding in the
greatest part of his Empire. These are the signs I have met with, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saging
his greatness. To proceed, after the death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> he was
Captain of the Guards of the Kings Houshold, a command, which whilst
the King lived, had been possessed by <hi>Ephestion,</hi> and after him by <hi>Perdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas;</hi>
from thence rising by degrees, he came to the Government of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
and at last mounted the Throne; and because he had gained many
Victories, he was called<note n="*" place="margin">The Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note> 
                  <hi>Nicator,</hi> for I think that more probable than to
imagine that because he slew <hi>Nicator,</hi> he bore away that name as a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
spoil. He was tall of Stature, and so strong, that when <hi>Alexander</hi> once
sacrified, a Bull in fury breaking from its Cords, and escaping, he alone
stop'd it, laying fast hold on his Horns, which is the reason why they place
Horns with his Statues. He beautified the Country under his Dominion
with many fair Cities, which he built from one end to the other, of which
sixteen he caused to be called by the name of his Father <hi>Antiochia's,</hi> six af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Mothers name <hi>Laodicea's,</hi> nine after his own name <hi>Seleucia's,</hi> four
after his Wives names, three after the first <hi>Apamia's,</hi> and one after the
last <hi>Stratonicea,</hi> the fairest remaining to this day are five, two <hi>Seleucia's,</hi> one
on the Sea side, the other on the <hi>Tigris. Laodicea</hi> in <hi>Phaenicia, Antiochia</hi> in
Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> and <hi>Apamia</hi> in <hi>Syria:</hi> He likewise gave names to others,
either Grecian or Macedonian names, as <hi>Beraea, Edessa, Maronea, Perinta,
Callipolis, Achaia, Polla, Orope, Amphipolis, Arethusa, Astachia, Tegaea,
Chalcis, Larissa, Heraea, Apolonia,</hi> and in <hi>Parthia</hi> it self, <hi>Sotera, Calliope,
Charis, Hecatonpolis, Achaia,</hi> in <hi>India, Alexandropolis;</hi> and in <hi>Scythia, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrescatta:</hi>
His Victories gave a name to <hi>Nicepborea</hi> in <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi>
and to <hi>Nicopolis</hi> in <hi>Armenia,</hi> which confines on <hi>Cappadocia.</hi> 'Tis said like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
that when he was about to build <hi>Seleucia</hi> on the Sea side: It was
marked out by the Thunder, wherefore the Thunder is there adored as a
God, and to this day they sing Hymns to it, and use many particular Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.
And when he designed to lay the Foundations of that, which is
upon the River <hi>Tygris;</hi> the <hi>Magi</hi> or Southsayers, who had Orders to set
out the day and hour, when the Work was to begin, to the end it might
be built under a fortunate Constellation, pitched upon an unhappy hour,
because they were not well pleased, that a great City should be built
there to awe themselves. And that as the King in his Tent waited for
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65196:52"/>
the fatal hour, and all the Army stood ready to lay their hands to the
Work, as soon as the Signal should be given them. The hour of good
Augury being come, the Soldiers on a sudden, thinking they heard the
Command given, fell to the Work with so much alacrity, that no forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
whatsoever could stay them: at which <hi>Seleucus</hi> was much cast down;
but the Magicians seeing him disquieted about the fate of the City, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
only safety for their persons, and having obtained it, spoke to
him in this manner.</p>

may believe we deceive you not again; You were here in person, you commanded
they should stay for the signal, and your Army, which in other occasions, where
they were to throw themselves into dangers, and to endure toil and labour, has
always been perfectly obedient to you, could not now stand still, though you
commanded it; but all on a sudden with its Officers ran to the work, as if it
had been commanded; and so indeed it was, and therefore could not be staid
at your commands; but who in humane affairs can have more power than a
King, but a God? God, which this day grants you the full of your desires.
God, who a more faithful Counsellor than we, is the Author of the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this City. God, enemy of our Nation and Allies, since now we have no
more strength left, having neighbours more powerful than we so near us. In
short, rest assured, this City is founded under a fortunate Constellation, and
shall flourish a long time. And now we hope as our fault proceeded only from
the fear we had of the decay of our felicity, you will not repent your self of
the pardon you have granted us. <hi>The King mightily pleased with the
Magi's discourse, forgave them: And this is what I have found concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/> Now <hi>Seleucus</hi> willing, that whilst he was yet living, his Son might be
King, gave to him the greatest part of his Territory in the main Land:
but though this were an action worthy the magnanimity of a mighty
Prince; in my judgement, what he did in favour of this Son's love, and
of that modesty he strugled with in his sickness, declared more courage
and prudence. For this young Prince was passionately in love with
<hi>Stratonice</hi> his Fathers Wife, by whom <hi>Seleucus</hi> had already had a Child;
yet knowing his passion to be criminal, he never discovered it, nor gave
the least symptom of it to any person: but smothering his grief, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
in his bed, and desired death. <hi>Erasistratus</hi> himself, that famous
Physician, to whom the King gave such large allowance, could not at all
conjecture whence his distemper sprung, till such time as observing
that he had no corrupt humours in his body, he concluded the seat of his
malady must be in the mind, the contagion of which had past into the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65196:52"/>
Body. He knew his Grief, Anger, and other disturbances of Man's Spirit,
could not well be concealed, but that a Modest Person might well conceal
his Love; and founding himself upon this, he privately discoursed it
with <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and conjured him to tell him the cause of his Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
But not being able to draw any thing from him, he kept near
his Bed, had diligently observed those Changes happened to him, when
any Woman entred his Chamber, and having taken notice that
when others came about him; his Body continued without any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
but at all times, when the Queen came to visit him, his
spirit seemed strangely moved, and shame and remorse of Conscience
seem'd written in his Face, though he said never a word; but that as
soon as she was gone, his Body resumed a more lively colour, and
with a fresh heat returned to its former Estate. Upon which he told
<hi>Seleucus, that his Sons distemper was incurable;</hi> whereat the King sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised,
let his Grief break out with a Shriek; and the Physician added,
<hi>'Tis for Love, Sir, that he dies, and the Love of a Woman he can never
enjoy. Seleucus</hi> was astonished, that there should be a Woman in the
World, that would not let her self be perswaded by a King of <hi>Asia,</hi>
when he proposed to her the Marriage of his Son, and thereto added
Prayers, Gifts and Money; nay, a great Kingdom, to which the Prince
was Heir, and which he would be ready to part with presently in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of his cure, if any one demanded it, and thereupon pressing
the Physician to tell him, who this Woman was: He replyed, <hi>'Tis my
wife, Sir.</hi> To which the King returned: <hi>And how good man, you that are
our Friend, and tyed to our House, by so many reciprocal Testimonies of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and besides all that, a wise and honest man; will not you save the life
of this young Prince, the Son of a King, your Friend, fallen unhappily in
Love, and who out of Modesty has concealed his Grief, even unto Death?
Can you make so little account, not only of</hi> Antiochus, <hi>but of</hi> Seleucus <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?</hi>
He feigning to be moved with these Arguments, turned them thus
upon the Father. <hi>And if he were</hi> (said he) <hi>in love with the Queen, would
you quit her to him?</hi> Hereupon <hi>Seleucus</hi> began to <hi>swear by all the Gods,
Protectors of his Crown, that he would give her him freeely, and with all
his heart, that he might leave to Posterity a Noble Example of Paternal
Goodness towards a Modest Son, who in his Affliction had not made the least
Complaint, and was absolutely unworthy of this Misfortune.</hi> In conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
after much Discourse of this Nature he declared, <hi>he was extremely
troubled, that he himself could not be the Physician of his Unfortunate Son,
without being beholding to</hi> Erasistratus: Who seeing now the King was
in earnest, discovered to him the whole matter, and how he came to
know it, notwithstanding all his Sons resistance. <hi>Seleucus</hi> seemed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verjoyed
at what he heard, and now there remained only the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of perswading his Son and the Queen; which he did, and after
having gained their Consent to his Proposition, he assembled his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
who perhaps had already some inkling of the Matter, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to make an enumeration of the great Actions he had done, by
which he had extended the Bound of his Empire farther, than any of
the Successors of <hi>Alexander,</hi> he then remonstrated to them, how being
grown old, it was hard for him to govern so vast a Kingdom. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
(said he) <hi>I will divide this mighty Mass, and that I may provide
for your security for the future, I am resolved to discharge my self at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of one half of this burthen on him that I esteem most dear. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that you will obey me in all things, it being but just you should do so.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65196:53"/>
You, I say, that since the death of</hi> Alexander, <hi>fighting under my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spices,
are mounted to so high a degree of Power. Now that which I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
most dear, and most worthy of this Empire is this young Prince,
the Elect of my Children, and this Princess, who being in a flourishing age,
will soon give you Children to be the stay and support of this great Empire.
I marry them therefore together in your presence, and I give them all those
Kingdoms I possess in the main Land. As for the thing it self, do not you
consider in it, so much the Custom of the Persians, and other Nations, as
the general Law, common to all men, which requires that Subjects should
believe whatever their King Decrees is just.</hi> As soon as he had uttered
these words, the Army began to make their Acclamations, proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him the greatest King since <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the best of all Fathers.
Thus <hi>Seleucus</hi> married his Wife with his Son, and sent them to take
possession of their Kingdom. And surely this Action gained him more
Reputation than all the Victories he had won; for he conquered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
He had seventy two Governments, under his Dominton, so vast it
was, of which he gave the greatest part to his Son, receiving to himself
only the Country, lying between <hi>Euphrates</hi> and the Sea. After this,
having War with <hi>Lysimachus</hi> (which was the last he had) he gave him
Battel on the confines of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> near the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> where <hi>Lysimachus</hi>
was slain. And as he had passed the Strait to siese upon <hi>Lysimachia,</hi> he
was himself slain by <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Serranus,</hi> who was one of his
Train. He was the Son of <hi>Ptolemy Soter,</hi> and of <hi>Euridice,</hi> the Daughter,
of <hi>Antipater,</hi> and fear having driven him from <hi>Egypt,</hi> because his Father
had resolved to give the Kindom to his younger Brother; <hi>Seleucus</hi> took
pitty on him, received him, as the Son of his Friend, entertained him at
his Table, and carried him still along with him, in recompence of which
he became his Murderer. Such was <hi>Seleucus</hi> his end, who dyed in the
seventy third year of his Age, and fortieth of his Reign; for my part, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
we may likewise refer to his death the answer of the Oracle: <hi>Take
leave of</hi> Europe, <hi>and possess</hi> Asia; for <hi>Lysimachia</hi> is in <hi>Europe;</hi> and this
was the first time he had repassed into <hi>Europe:</hi> After having followed
<hi>Alexander</hi> to the Conquest of <hi>Asia:</hi> 'Tis said, demanding a Magician
where he should dye, he received this Answer.
<q>
                     <l>Keep far from <hi>Argos</hi> to prolong the date</l>
                     <l>Of Life, for else thou hastnest on thy Fate.</l>
                  </q>
After which he made an exact search of all places, called <hi>Argos,</hi> and
took special care not to go near the <hi>Argos</hi> of <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> of <hi>Amphilochia,</hi>
of <hi>Orestiade,</hi> from whence some Macedonians are called <hi>Argeades,</hi> or so
much as to a City of that name, which <hi>Diomedes,</hi> during his banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
had caused to be built beyond the Ionian Sea; but that as he
was going from the <hi>Hellespont</hi> to <hi>Lysimachia,</hi> he saw an Alter built upon
an Eminence, and having demanded the name of the place, they told
him it was called <hi>Argos,</hi> and that whilst he was informing himself of the
cause of that name, whether the Argonauts passing that way had not
given it, whether the Inhabitants of the Country had not called it so,
because of the Argians, that went to the Wars of <hi>Troy;</hi> or at last, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it might bear that name in memory of the Country of the <hi>Atrides.
Ptolemy</hi> thrust him with his Sword through the Body. <hi>Phileterus,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65196:53"/>
of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> redeemed his Body from <hi>Serranus,</hi> with a great sum
of Money; and when he had burnt it, sent the Ashes to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who
caused a magnificent Monument to be raised for him in <hi>Seleucia</hi> on the
Sea, and built a Temple in Honour of him, which was called <hi>Nicatorion.</hi>
As for <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> 'tis said that he was one of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Guard of the
Body; and that one day having a long time followed the King on foot,
who was on Horse-back, he grew so weary, that to ease himself, he laid
hand on the Horse tail, and by chance was pricked in a Vein of his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
by the point of <hi>Alexanders</hi> Javelin, which hung behind the Crup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
from whence there issued so much Blood, that that Prince having
nothing else, bound it up with his Diadem, which being afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to that Prince all bloody, <hi>Aristander,</hi> the South-sayer foretold,
that the wounded person should be a King, but should always Reign in
Wars and Troubles. And indeed he ruled forty years, comprising the
time, when he assumed but the quality of Governour, and at last was
slain at the age of seventy years, with his Arms in his Hand, his Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisher
<hi>Seleucus</hi> not long out living him. <hi>Lysimachus</hi> being slain, a Dog
he had loved, staid a long time by the Body, and defended it from the Birds and Beasts, till such time as <hi>Thorax</hi> of <hi>Pharsalia</hi> finding it, gave it Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
Though some there be that say, that he was buried by a Son of his, called <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom fear had made seek a refuge with <hi>Seleucus,</hi>
when <hi>Lysimachus</hi> put to death <hi>Agathocles</hi> his other Son; and that his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
having a long time been sought after, was at length found by means
of a Dog, quite putrefied, and was buried by the Inhabitants of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simachia</hi>
in a Temple, which was afterwards called <hi>Lysimachion.</hi> Thus
dyed also at the same time two Kings of equal stature, and of
an extraordinary strength of Body, one at the age of seventy years, and
the other three more, fighting in person to their very death.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Seleucus</hi> his death, his Sons succeeded in his Kingdom of <hi>Syria,</hi>
the first of which was <hi>Antiochus,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Soter,</hi> who fell in love with
his Mother-in-Law, and afterwards repulsed the Gauls, who had made
an irruption out of <hi>Europe</hi> into <hi>Asia.</hi> The second was another <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
born of the same Woman, he whom the Milesians called God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he had delivered them from <hi>Timarchus</hi> their Tyrant, but this God dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Poison, given him by his Wife. He had married two, whom
he equally loved, <hi>Laodice</hi> and <hi>Berenice,</hi> Daughters of <hi>Ptolemeus Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphus,</hi>
one of which two, to wit, <hi>Laodice</hi> gave him his death, as she
did soon after to her Sister <hi>Berenice,</hi> and her Child. <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> the Son
of <hi>Philadelphus</hi> revenged this crime by the death of <hi>Laodice,</hi> and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into <hi>Syria,</hi> as far as <hi>Babylon,</hi> which gave occasion to the Parthians,
seeing the House of the <hi>Seleucides</hi> in trouble, to shake off the Yoke of
their Dominion. To this Man, sirnamed God, succeeded in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Syria, Seleucus</hi> his Son by <hi>Laodice,</hi> who was called <hi>Callinicus,</hi>
and after <hi>Callinicus</hi> his two Sons, <hi>Seleucus</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> one after the
other: the Eldest of which having neither health nor strength enough to
keep his Army in awe, was poisoned by his Domesticks, having reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only two years; and for <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who was sirnamed the Great, it
was he who had War with the Romans, the History of which we have
now wrote. We have likewise spoke of his two Sons, who reigned
both one after the other, <hi>Seleucus</hi> twelve years, without
doing any thing
considerable, (nor indeed had the power, by reason of his Fathers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
losses) and <hi>Antiochus</hi> only two years, during which he took pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
<hi>Artaxias,</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and undertook an expedition into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:65196:54"/>
against <hi>Ptolemy</hi> the Sixth, one of those two Sons, whom their
Father lately dead, had left for his Successors. As he lay encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
near <hi>Alexandria, Popilius</hi> the Roman Deputy came into his Camp
with Letters, whereby he was commanded to depart the Kingdom of
the <hi>Ptolemies.</hi> After he had read them, and said he would consider of
them, <hi>Popilius</hi> made a Circle upon the Ground about him with a Rod he
had in his hand, bidding him, <hi>consider before he went out thence,</hi> which
so terrified him, that he presently departed the Realm; and because in
his way, he plundered the Temple of <hi>Venus</hi> in <hi>Elymais,</hi> he dyed of a
rottenness of the Lungs: He left a Son nine years old, called <hi>Antiochus
Eupator,</hi> of whom we have spoken, as also of <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Successor,
who being Hostage in <hi>Rome,</hi> escaped into <hi>Syria,</hi> where having taken
possession of the Kingdom, the Syrians gave him the name of <hi>Soter,</hi> which
the Sons of <hi>Nicator</hi> had before born. There was one <hi>Alexander</hi> raised
Arms against him falsely, saying he was of the Race of the <hi>Seleucides;</hi>
and being supported by <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of the hate he bore
to <hi>Demetrius,</hi> he drove him out of his Kingdom; he dying in Exile, his
Son, called likewise <hi>Demetrius,</hi> reconquered it, and because he had Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
this <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who was not of the Family of the <hi>Seleucides,</hi> he
was called by the Syrians <hi>Nicator,</hi> like the first <hi>Seleucus,</hi> from whom the
Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> were descended. And endeavouring to follow his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
he undertook an expedition against the Parthians, where being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Prisomer, he lived a long time in the Court of <hi>Phraates,</hi> and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<hi>Rhodogune,</hi> that Kings Sister. Mean while a Domestick of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
King's, called <hi>Diodotus,</hi> seeing the Throne of <hi>Syria</hi> without a King,
siesed on it to advance therein a Child, named <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Son of
that bastard <hi>Alexander,</hi> and a Daughter of <hi>Ptolemyes;</hi> and soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having made away his Pupil, had the boldness to make himself
King, changing the name of <hi>Diodotus</hi> into that of <hi>Tryphon. Antiochus,</hi>
Brother of the Prisoner <hi>Demetrius,</hi> hearing at <hi>Rhodes</hi> of his Brothers Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
and all the disorders succeeding it, returned into his Country,
where with much labour he reduced this <hi>Tryphon;</hi> and having put him
to death, advanced with his Army against <hi>Phraates,</hi> to oblige him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease
his Brother, whom he presently sent to him out of a fear, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,
at that time, had of War, yet this stopt him not from pursuing
his design, and engaging in Battel with the Parthian, wherein being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome,
he slew himself. <hi>Demetrius</hi> returned to his Kingdom was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by his Wife <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> enraged at the second Marriage with <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogune,</hi>
the news of which had before been the cause, that during the
Captivity of her Husband, she had married with her Brother <hi>Antiochus,</hi>
she had two Sons by <hi>Demetrius, Seleucus</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Grypus;</hi>
and by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> another <hi>Antiochus</hi> called the <hi>Cyzycenian,</hi> of whom
<hi>Grypus</hi> she caused to be brought up at <hi>Athens,</hi> and the <hi>Cyzycenian</hi> at
<hi>Cyzica.</hi> As for <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who had caused himself to be crowned immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after the death of his Father, she killed him her self with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
whether it were she were fearful, he should revenge his Fathers
death, or that she had conceived a hate against the whole Family. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus</hi>
being dead, the Kingdom descended to <hi>Grypus,</hi> who forced his
Mother to drink a Poison she had prepared for him. Thus she at last
was punished, and for him he degenerated nothing from <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> for
he having advice of it, declared War against his Brother, drove him
out of his Kingdom, and made himself King of <hi>Syria,</hi> he enjoyed it no
long time, being himself expelled by the Arms of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> Son to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65196:54"/>
Grypus,</hi> who respected not in him the Quality of Uncle; but he
became so violent, and lived with so much Tyranny, that being at <hi>Mopsa,</hi>
a City of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> he was burnt alive in the place of publick Exercise.
His Successor was <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the Son of the <hi>Cyzycenian,</hi> whom the Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
believed had escaped his Uncles traps, only for his Piety, wherefore
they sirnamed him the Pious; and yet he was only saved by a Curtezan
fell in love with him, because of his Beauty, which makes me think the
Syrians gave him that name, only out of a jeer; for this Pious man
married <hi>Selene,</hi> who had before been married to his Father the <hi>Cyzyoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
and to his Uncle <hi>Grypus.</hi> Therefore Divine Justice suffered him in
punishment of his Crime to be driven out of his Kingdom by <hi>Tigranes;</hi>
and the Son he had by <hi>Selene,</hi> who being bred in <hi>Asia</hi> was called <hi>Asia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>
to be deprived of his Kingdom by <hi>Pompey,</hi> as we have before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
having reigned only one year, during which that General was
elsewhere employ'd. He was the seventeenth King after <hi>Seleucus,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reckoning <hi>Alexander</hi> the Bastard, or his Son, who were not of the
Race, nor their Domestick <hi>Diodotus.</hi> To conclude, the Race of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucides</hi>
Reigned two hundred and seventy years, and if we account from
the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, till this Kingdom was reduced into the
form of a Province, we must likewise add those fourteen years which <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes</hi>
Reigned. Thus much I thought good to say, by the way, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Macedonians, that were Kings of <hi>Syria,</hi> though the Subject be
somewhat separate from our History.</p>

<hi>Ionia,</hi> the Romans being imbroiled in Civil Wars: yet did they nothing
memorable, besides spoiling the Country, rather like thieves then Men of
War, and all that was but the consequence of <hi>Crassus</hi> overthrow, which
had given them a boldness that <hi>Anthony</hi> was at last to give check to,
but to write the History of this Expedition we must begin our discourse
farther of.</p>
               <p>The day of Assembly for Election of Consuls being come. <hi>C. Caesar,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
Pompey</hi> the Great, and <hi>Marcus Crassus</hi> being found Competitors, the two
last (notwithstanding all the endeavors of <hi>Cicero, Cato</hi> and those of the
Contrary Faction) obtained the Consulate by force, and prolonged to
<hi>Caesar</hi> the Government of <hi>Gaul</hi> for five other years. Having drawn by lot
the Governments of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Spain. Syria</hi> fell to <hi>Crassus,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> to
<hi>Pompey,</hi> with which all Men were well satisfied. For the people were
pleased that <hi>Pompey</hi> should not go far from the City, and there was great
likelyhood because he extreamly loved his Wife, that he would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
absent himself for any long time. On the other side <hi>Crassus</hi> as soon
as he saw himself Governor of <hi>Syria,</hi> dissembled not his satisfaction. He
thought no greater happiness could have arrived him, and so far did his
Excess of Joy transport him, as to make him in his familiar conversation
with his friends, utter a thousand extravagancies, which savored of the
young Man, and seemed contrary to his nature, who had never been taken
for a Proud Man or a Boaster; but now exalting his thoughts above their due
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65196:56"/>
level, his judgment was perverted, insomuch that he not only promised
himself to subdue the Syrians and the Parthians, but as if the Victories
gained by <hi>Lucullus</hi> against <hi>Tigranes,</hi> and by <hi>Pompey</hi> against <hi>Mithridates</hi>
had been but sports, his depraved imaginations carried him as far as the
Bactrians, the Indians, and the Oriental Ocean. Though in his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
there was not any mention made of a War against the Parthians, yet
no Man doubted but he was resolved to undertake it. <hi>Caesar</hi> himself wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to him from <hi>Gaul</hi> commended his design, and exhorted him to pursue
it, but many good and understanding Men, thought it strange he should go
to make War against innocent people who only demanded peace. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Crassus,</hi> having intelligence that <hi>Atteius</hi> Tribune of the people had a
design to hinder his going out of the City, was afraid, and intreated <hi>Pompey</hi>
who had a great power over the spirits of the people, to be his Conductor,
they found in the Street a great number of Persons disposed to Arrest him,
but <hi>Pompey</hi> observing them, went to meet them, and with a smiling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
appeased them; so that they held their peace, and gave him pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.
<hi>Atteius</hi> only made opposition, first by forbidding <hi>Crassus</hi> to pass
any farther, and then by commanding the Usher to sieze his person, but
the other Tribunes not thinking it convenient, let him pass. Then <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teius</hi>
ran to the Gate, and filling a chafing dish with fire, as <hi>Crassus</hi> past by
made efusions thereon, pronouncing Execrations against the Consul, and
invoking Gods, whose names were new and dreadful. This manner of
cursing is very Ancient, and the Romans are of Opinion that these Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations
are so powerful, that whoever they are pronounced against
cannot escape, nor can any good happen to him that pronounces them,
wherefore they never use them rashly, and now many persons blamed
<hi>Alteius,</hi> in that by declaring himself Enemy to <hi>Crassus</hi> though in favor
of the Commonwealth, he had filled the minds of the whole City with
fear and Superstition. Yet all this hindered not the Consul from setting
forward to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> and though the Winter which was not yet near
past might have diverted him from adventuring to Sea, yet he would stay
no longer, so that he lost many of his Ships by Storm, and having rallied
the remainder of his forces, took his way by Land through <hi>Galatia,</hi> where
he found King <hi>Deiotarus,</hi> who was of a great age, building a New City
to whom he said in raillery. <hi>You begin to build at twelve a clock,</hi> to which
the other replyed smiling, <hi>and you I perceive go not against the Parthians
very early.</hi> For <hi>Crassus</hi> had already past sixty years of age, and look'd much
Elder then he was.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Being arrived in the Province, the first success of his affairs answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
very well to his hopes, for having caused a Bridge to be built, he with
ease and security passed his Army over the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and received under
his obedience many Cities of <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> which surrendred to him; One
he besieged called by the Greeks <hi>Zenodocia,</hi> which was defended by a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
named <hi>Apollonius,</hi> and because he had lost before it one hundred of
his Soldiers, he stormed it with his whole Army, took it, razed it, and
sold all the Inhabitants he could find by Outcry. After this he permitted
his Army to call him Emperor by which he lost much of his Reputation,
as if having gained this Victory, his hopes had reached no higher. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
he placed Garrisons in all the Cities had surrendred, whose num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
amounted to seven thousand Foot, and a thousand Horse, and with
the rest of his Army, came to take up his Winter-quarters in <hi>Syria,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his Son who had born Arms in <hi>Gaul</hi> under <hi>Caesar,</hi> from whom he had
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65196:56"/>
received many Military rewards, came to him with a thousand chosen
Horse. This was in my opinion the second fault <hi>Crassus</hi> committed, after
having rashly undertaken this Enterprise, for whilst he ought to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
as far as <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Seleucia,</hi> Cities in all times Enemy to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
by keeping at this distance he gave the Enemy time to make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations.
The stay he made in <hi>Syria</hi> gained him not more glory, for he
lived rather like a Tax-gatherer then a General. The time which should
have been employed in making provision of Arms, and exercising the
Soldiers, was spent in reckoning up the Revenue of the Cities, and in
weighing and measuring the Gold and Silver consecrated to the Goddess
of <hi>Hierapolis.</hi> And when he had Ordered the Lords and Commonalty of
the Country to set out a certain Number of Soldiers, he presently dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with them for Mony, whereby he drew upon himself the scorn of all
the World. It was at the Temple of the forementioned Goddess, whom
some will have to be <hi>Venus,</hi> others <hi>Iuno,</hi> others <hi>Nature,</hi> which contains
in her the seed of all things, there it was I say that he received the first
presage of his ill fortune. For as the Father and Son came out thence, the
young Man stumbled, and fell before the Gate of the Temple, and the old
Man fell upon his Son.</p>
               <p>Whilst he was drawing his Forces out of the Garrisons there came to
him Ambassadors from<note n="*" place="margin">The General name of the Kings of <hi>Parthia.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Arsaces</hi> who said but little to him, the sense of
which was this. <hi>That if the People of</hi> Rome <hi>had sent that Army, the War
would not end, but by the absolute ruine of one of the parties, but if it were
true (as was reported) that</hi> Crassus <hi>without his Countries consent, and for
his own particular interests had undertaken it,</hi> Arsaces <hi>would not then do his
utmost, but having compassion on the Consuls age, would let the Romans go,
whom he considered rather as men besieged then Conquerors,</hi> To which <hi>Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
having arrogantly replyed <hi>that he would give them an answer at</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucia,
<hi>Vagises</hi> chief of the deputation in a fit of laughter showing the
Palm of his hand; <hi>Crassus</hi> said he, <hi>there shall hair grow here before thou
see</hi> Seleucia, and therewith the Ambassadors departed to give advice to
<note n="*" place="margin">The Kings particular Name.</note> 
                  <hi>Orodes</hi> their King that he must resolve for War. Immediately after,
some of those who had been placed in Garrison in the <hi>Cities</hi> of <hi>Mesopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia,</hi>
having escaped through all the difficulties in the World, came to
the Camp, where they bred no small disturbance. They gave account of
the vast number of Enemies they had seen, the labors they had undergone
in defence of the Cities from whence they were driven, and aggravating
every thing, as is usual in such cases, they assured their fellows that it was
impossible to escape from the Parthians when they pursued, nor to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
them when they fled, that their Arrows wounded before they could
be perceived, and that nothing was proof against them, whilst they were
Armed with such strong Curasses that nothing could offend them. The
Roman Soldiers hearing these discourses were appalled, for being perswaded
that the Enemies differed nothing from the Armenians, and Cappadocians
whom <hi>Lucullus</hi> had beaten till he was weary, and believing that the most of
their labor would be the length of the way, and the trouble to pursue
Enemies that durst not stay for them, they saw that quite contrary to the
opinion they had entertained, this War would be both doubtful and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;
Insomuch that the Chief Officers of the Army were of opinion to
hinder <hi>Crassus</hi> from proceeding farther, till he had considered more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely
of an affair, which concerned the safety or loss of so many Men.
Moreover the Augures gave private notice that the Entrails of the Beasts
promised no good, and that <hi>Crassus</hi> his Sacrifices were not pleasing to the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65196:57"/>
Gods. But he would hearken to nothing from them or any other but
those who encouraged him generously to pursue his design; among which
the counsel of <hi>Artabasus</hi> King of <hi>Armenia</hi> made great impression on his
Spirit, for he came to the Roman Camp, with six thousand Horse
which they call the Kings guards with promise to furnish ten thousand
Horse more, and thirty thousand Foot at his own expence, perswading to
assault the Parthians, by the way of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and he would take care to
guide the Army a commodious way, and to furnish them with all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
and that thus <hi>Crassus</hi> would have continual Mountains to
March through, and places difficult for Horse Service, in which the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi>
strength chiefly consisted. The Consul highly applauded the Kings
good will, and praised the Magnificence of his Troops, but told him he
would take the way of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> where he had left a great quantity of
Valiant Men of the Roman name. After this conference the <hi>Armenian</hi>
returned into his Kingdom. As for <hi>Crassus,</hi> as he caused his Army to
pass over a Bridge, great Claps of Thunder began to make a dreadful noise,
and continual flashes of lightning darted in the Soldiers eyes, besides all on
the sudden an impetuous storm, raged against the Bridge, and carried
away a part of it. It happened likewise that the lightning fell twice in
the place whereon they were to encamp, and one of the Consuls Horses
in his most stately Trappings carried the Esquire that rode him, into the
River notwithstanding all endeavors to stop him, nor were either Horse
or Man ever seen afterwards; They say likewise that the Eagle that was
first taken up by the Standard-bearer, of it self sell backward, and that
when the Army having past the River sat down to eat, they by chance
gave the Soldiers nothing but Lentils and Broath, which is counted doleful
meat, because only served at Funerals. Afterwards as <hi>Crassus</hi> made an
Oration to his Army, there escaped from him a word which struck a
strange terror into the minds of the Soldiers. For he told them he had
caused the Bridge over the River to be broke down, that not one of
them might return; and though that absurdity might have been repaired
by explaining the words, and that the Consul ought to have interpreted it,
that he might not leave upon their Spirits an Impression of ill Presage, yet
he would not do it out of Stubbornness. After this having mustered his
Army, he offered a Sacrifice, and as the Priest put the Entrails of the beast
into his hands, he let them fall, at which the assistants being scandalized,
he laughing said, <hi>These are the inconveniences of old age, but our Armswill
never fall out of our hands.</hi> He then found that the Army which passed the
River consisted of seven Legions, about four thousand Horse, and as many
light Armed Foot.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Sometime after the Scouts brought in word that the whole Region was
desert, and that they had only discovered the track of a great Number of
Horses which seemed to fly before them, upon which intelligence <hi>Crassus</hi>
conceived some good hopes, and the Soldiers began to despise the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
believing they would never stand to fight them. However <hi>Crassus,</hi>
and some of the Consuls Friends, advised him to retire into some one of
those places he held in that Country, till such time as he had received
more certain advice of the Enemy, or at least that he would march them
towards <hi>Seleucia,</hi> along the Banks of the River, for so greater plenty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
might be brought him by water, and in case the Enemy came to
assail him, the River might serve as a Rampire, so that they could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compass
him about, and by that means he might fight them with equal
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65196:57"/>
Forces. As <hi>Crassus</hi> was consulting about the importance of this Counsel,
there arrived in the Camp an Arabian Gentleman called <hi>Agbarus,</hi> cunning
but treacherous, whom Fortune made use of as the Principal Instrument,
for destruction of the Army; some who had born Arms under <hi>Pompey,</hi>
knew him, and remembring that Great General had obliged him, thought
he might have an affection for the Romans. But indeed he was sent to
<hi>Crassus</hi> by those who Commanded the Kings Army, to draw him if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
from the River, and Foot of the Mountains, and make him take into
the Plain, where the Horse had more advantage. For they were resolved
on nothing less then to come to a pitcht battel with the Romans in that
place. <hi>Agbarus</hi> therefore coming to salute <hi>Crassus,</hi> and being well spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
began his discourse with the praises of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and the kindnesses he
had received from him, then he sell to discourse of the mighty power of
<hi>Crassus,</hi> setting forth that he wrong'd himself in spending time in consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
when he was but more than too strong, for there was not any need
of Arms, but only of nimble Feet and Hands, to deal with a People; who
had a long time been prepared to pack up their Mony and Choicest Riches,
and fly into <hi>Scythia</hi> or <hi>Hyrcania, But if you will fight,</hi> said he, <hi>you must make
hast lest the King resuming Courage Rally up likewise his Forces, for at present
you have only to deal with</hi> Surena <hi>who is the Rear-guard of those Forces that
make their Retreat, for as for the King, they know not where he is.</hi> Now all
this was false, for <hi>Orodes</hi> had upon the first of the War divided his Forces
into two Armies, with one of which he had invaded <hi>Armenia,</hi> where he
made strange Havock to Revenge himself of <hi>Artabasus,</hi> and had given the
other in charge to <hi>Surena</hi> to oppose the Romans. Not out of scorn as
some say, for there is no likelyhood that he should disdain to deal with
<hi>Crassus</hi> a Roman Consul or that he could think it more Honorable to wage
War with <hi>Artabasus</hi> or Plunder the Villages of <hi>Armenia,</hi> but for my part I
am of the opinion he retired thither for fear of the danger, or as into an
Ambuscado, to expect the success of the War. For <hi>Surena</hi> was no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Man, being both for Riches, Birth and Quality, the second to the
King, and for Valor and Vigor of Body, the Chief among all the Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
besides he was large of Stature, and of as Noble an Aspect as any Man
living could be. He had continually in his train a thousand Camels for
burthen, two hundred Coaches for his Women, and for his Guard a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Men at Arms, besides a greater Number of Light Horse, so that the
Ordinary Train of his Houshold, was ten thousand Horse, reckoning his
Vassals and Slaves, and by an Ancient Hereditary Right of his Family he
had the Honor first to set the Crown on the head of the new King of the
Parthians: He had brought back this same <hi>Orodes</hi> from Exile, and restored
him to the Throne, he had by Storm taken the Great <hi>Seleucia,</hi> being the
first that mounted on the walls, from whence himself drove the Guards
that defended them, and though he were not now above thirty years of
age, he was esteemed one of the most Politick Men of the time he lived
in, which he shewed by entrapping <hi>Crassus,</hi> who yet in truth was easie to
be deceived, first by reason of his pride and daring, and at last because of
his fear, and the distress to which he saw himself reduced. <hi>Agbarus</hi>
therefore having by fair words perswaded him to leave the River, caused
him to take his march through the midst of vast plains, naked of trees, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till'd,
and of which they saw no end, so that the Soldiers grew faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted,
not only for thirst, and the tediousness of the way, but because
they found no refreshment in their travel, they saw neither River nor
Mountain, nor any green thing, but as if they had been in the wide Sea,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65196:58"/>
they beheld nothing on all sides but an affrightful solitude. All this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
gave them some suspition of Treason which was confirmed, when
Ambassadors from <hi>Artabasus</hi> came to acquaint the Consul that their King
being engaged in a War against <hi>Orodes,</hi> who had invaded his Country
could not send him any assistance, but that he advised him to turn his
Arms that way, and to joyn with the Armenians to give battel to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,
or if that were not his judgment, at least so to order his march that
he took care not to engage in the plains, where the Horse should have too
much advantage, but that he should as much as he could draw towards
the Mountains. To all which <hi>Crassus</hi> who would not write a word in
Answer to the king, brutishly and like a Man in Choler made Answer,
<hi rend="margQuotes">That he was not now at leisure to think of the affairs of <hi>Armenin,</hi> but
that at his return he would Chastise <hi>Artabasus</hi> for his treachery.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Cassius</hi> and those that were of his mind grew angry, but without say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a word to <hi>Crassus,</hi> who would not listen to any good counsel
given him, they fell to reviling <hi>Agbarus</hi> with a thousand reproachful words.
<hi>What niischievous Devil brought thee hither, thou most villanous of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi>
(said they to him) <hi>by what Witchcraft or Inchantments hast thou been
able to perswade</hi> Crassus, <hi>to take his march through these vast Solitudes, a road
more proper for a</hi> Numidian <hi>Robber then a Roman General?</hi> But he being
cunning entertained them still with fair words, exhorting them to have a
little patience, and encourageing the tired Soldiers to march, and with
flattering smiles telling them: <hi>What do you think you are marching now
through</hi> Campania, <hi>or do you hope to find here Fountains, Rivers, Shades,
Baths, and continual Inns? Remember, pray remember that you pass now by
the confines of</hi> Arabia <hi>and</hi> Syria. Thus <hi>Agbarus</hi> treated the Romans as if
he had been their Paedagogue, and before his Treason was discovered he
left them, not by stealth but by consent of the Consul, whom he made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he went to give Orders about things necessary, and to create some
disorder in the Enemies Camp. 'Tis said that that day <hi>Crassus</hi> came forth
not in a Purple Robe, according to the manner of the Roman Generals,
but cloathed in Black, which yet he went and changed as soon as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it, and that some Ensigns pitcht in the ground stuck so fast, that those
who were to carry them, could scarcely pull them out, at all which <hi>Crassus</hi>
did but laugh.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> He Commanded presently to March, and earnestly urged the Legions to
follow the Horse, when some of his Scouts coming in, brought word that
others of their fellows had been slain by the Enemy, and they had hardly
escaped, and that there was a dreadful multitude following them at the
heels with resolution to fight. This news amazed the whole Army, but
especially <hi>Crassus,</hi> who began to draw his Army into Battel, but with a
great deal of Irresolution. First, according to <hi>Cassius</hi> advice, he drew up
his Legions at length, extending them as far as ever he could, that the
Enemy might not surround them, and placing his Horse on the wings,
but afterwards changing his mind, he formed his Legions into a Battel of
four Fronts, each of which he covered with twelve Cohorts, each Cohorts
strengthened by a squadron of Horse, that all four might be equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by the Horse. One of the wings he gave in charge to <hi>Cassius,</hi> the
other to his Son, and kept himself in the main battel. Marching in this
Order they gained a River called <hi>Balissa,</hi> which though neither deep nor
large was very welcome to the Soldiers, who had had so toilsome a March
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65196:58"/>
through heat and dust, most of the Officers advised not only the refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Soldiers, but resting that night there, to the intent, that making
the best discovery they possibly could of the number and posture of the
Enemy, they might be the better able to encounter the next Morning:
but young <hi>Crassus,</hi> and his Horsemen, calling out for the Battel, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul
again re-incouraged, commanded that those, who had a mind to take
any repast, should eat without stirring from their Ranks; and scarcely
had he allowed them to take what Food was necessary, but he marched
forward the Army, not slowly and often halting, as is usually done by
those, who would preserve their Men for the Fight; but upon the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop,
and all in a breath, till such time as the Enemy appeared sooner
than they looked for them; but neither in any great numbers, nor in a
posture to give any terrour to the Romans; for the main Body of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was hid by these Vant-curriers, who by <hi>Surena</hi>'s order had with loose
Coats covered their Armour.</p>
               <p>But when they drew nearer, and that the Enemies had given Signal of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/>
Battel, there was heard throughout the whole Plain a dreadful noise, for
the Parthians use in War neither Horns or Trumpets; but knowing
well that of all the Senses, the Ear is most capable of affecting the Mind;
and stirring up the Passions, they beat all at once through the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
certain Drums, whose hollowness makes dreadful roaring, which in
some measure imitates Thunder. This noise having begun to terrifie the
Romans, the Parthians threw off their loose Coats, and shewed their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of polished Steel, whose brightness dazled the eyes, and they were
discovered to be mounted on Horses, barbed and covered with plates of
Iron and Copper. <hi>Surena</hi> made a show above all the rest, the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of whose habit seemed somewhat effeminate, and disagreeable to
the high Reputation he had gained: but in this he followed the Custom
of the Medes, who go to Battel painted and curled, whereas the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
tuck up their Hair on their Foreheads, to make them appear more
formidable. At first they charged on the Spur with Lances in their Rests
against the Front of the Roman Battel, to try to break it: but having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the Legionary Bucklers joyned so close, and their Ranks fast locked
together, they retired, and as if they had disbanded, and quitting their
Ranks, wheeled about the Roman Army: <hi>Crassus</hi> sent against them his
light armed Men, who went not far; for the Soldiers soon finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
overwhelmed, and beaten down with showrs of Arrows, ran to
save themselves among the Ranks of the Legions, bringing amongst them
great confusion and disorder; especially when it was perceived, that those
were discharged with such a violence, that they equally wounded those that
were armed, and those that were not. And now the Parthians began
to fight at a distance with Flights of Arrows from all sides, which were
never shot in vain; for the Romans were so closed together, that though
the Parthians would, they could not well have mist them; and their
Bows being great and strong, and managed by vigorous Arms, made no
slight Wounds: Insomuch that the Romans were already hard put to it.
If they stood firm without quitting Ranks, they were wounded; and if
they pressed to assault the Enemy, they could not reach them, and yet
were wounded still; for the Parthians discharged their Arrows, as they
fled; and next the Scythians are certainly the most skilful Nation in the
World in this Exercise, invented doubtless to defend at once, both from
the Enemy, and from the shame of flight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:65196:59"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> However, the Romans had patience so long as they hoped, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
having once drained their Quivers, would either retire, or come
to fight hand to hand: but when they understood that they had in their
Army great numbers of Camels laden with Arrows, whither they went
by turns to fill again their Quivers, as fast as they had emptied, they
were utterly dismayed; <hi>Crassus</hi> seeing no end of this kind of fight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to afflict himself, and sent to tell his Son, that he should advance
to charge the Enemy, before they were inclosed; for they pressed hard
upon him, and wheeled about the Wing, which he commanded to fall on
in the Rear. This young Man having therefore taken thirteen hundred
Horse, of which <hi>Caesar</hi> had given him a thousand, and eight Cohorts of
Foot armed with Bucklers, which stood next him, drew off, and went fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
to charge the gross of the Enemy; but they (whether that place
were miry, as some say, or that by this stratagem, they had a mind to
draw the Consuls Son, as far as was possible, from the rest of the Army)
turned tail and fled. He presently with loud cryes declared the Enemies
flight, and addressed himself to pursue them, accompanied by <hi>Censorinus</hi>
and <hi>Megabachus;</hi> this last famous for strength of Body, and height of
Courage; the other a Senator, and besides a great Orator, both of the
same age with young <hi>Crassus,</hi> and his familiar Friends. The Horse fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and the Foot after them, all filled with joy and hope, believing
they gave chase to a Vanquished Enemy; but they had not gone far e're
they discovered the cheat, beholding those return to the charge, who had
made a show of flight, supported now and strengthned with great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
Whereupon those who were at the Head of the Romans stood
still, believing, because of their small number, the Enemies would come
and assault them at hand: but they opposed them only with their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciers,
whilst the rest scouting up and down the Plain, with their Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofs
broke the surface of the Earth, from whence arose such clouds of
Sand and Dust, that the Romans could neither see nor speak: So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus lock'd up close together in a croud, they were wounded, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not of a quick and easie death, but with strange pains and convulsions
caused by the Arrows sticking in their Bodies, which not being able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
they rolled themselves upon the ground to break them in their
wounds, or else striving to pull them out with the barbed heads, which
had pierced into the Veins and Nerves, they grievously tore themselves,
and added fresh anguish to the former. Thus most of all those Cohorts
that followed the Horse being slain, the rest remained useless, because
of their wounds; and when their Captains commanded them to go charge
the Parthian Men at Arms, they showed their hands nailed to their Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
or their Feet struck through and fastned to the ground; so that they
could neither fight nor flee. Hereupon young <hi>Crassus</hi> resolved to make
one brisk attempt with his Horse, but the strokes they gave with their
weak and slender Javelins, having but small effects on the others Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasses
of boild Leather, guarded with bands of Iron; whilst on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
their steel-headed Lances piercing through and through the Gauls
lightly armed, and almost naked, made the march very unequal. He had
great confidence in these Gauls, and indeed they did act wonders, they
siesed on these Lances with their naked hands, and in endeavouring to
wrest them away, tumbled the Men at Arms from off their Horses; who
being over-laden with Iron, could very hardly mount again: There were
likewise some of them, who quitting their own Horses, went and thrust
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65196:59"/>
their Swords in the bellies of those of the Enemy, who mounting at the
smart of the wound, tumbled back with their Riders, so that many were
by this means trampled to death under the Horse Feet, as well of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
as the Parthians: but nothing was more insufferable to the Gauls
than the heat and drowth, to which they were not accustomed; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
many had lost their Horses, which had been slain by the Pikes or
Lances. Wherefore they resolved to recover the Legions, having in the
midst of them the young <hi>Crassus,</hi> already tortured with many wounds:
but seeing nigh unto them a Hillock of Sand, which formed a kind of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence,
they retired thither, and tying in the midst those Horses they
had left; fortified themselves with their Bucklers, which they ranked
round about them, thinking by this means to defend themselves from the
Barbarians: but it fell out quite contrary; for though in a Level those
before do in some measure cover those behind, yet here, by reason of
the declining ground, one standing above another, no person could be in
security. They were all wounded alike, and dyed with the more vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that they could not revenge themselves, but must all perish without
Glory. There were along with the young <hi>Crassus</hi> two Greeks, Citizens of
of <hi>Carres,</hi> called <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Nicomachus,</hi> who would have perswaded him
to have saved himself with them in the City of <hi>Ichnes,</hi> which took part
with the Romans: but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he made answer, There were no death so cruel,
that for fear of it. <hi>Publius</hi> would forsake his Companions, who had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
themselves in that danger, but for his sake. And at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
gave leave to them, exhorting them to take care of themselves; but
for his own part, not being able to make use of his hand, because of a
wound he had received by an Arrow, he presented his brest to his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
commanding him to run him through. Some say <hi>Censorinus</hi> dyed
in the same manner, and that <hi>Megabachus,</hi> and most of the Nobility slew
themselves. The rest assailed by the Parthians, dyed generously defending
themselves, and 'tis reported five hundred only were taken alive. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
forthwith cut off the Heads of young <hi>Crassus,</hi> and his Companions,
and returned to seek out his Father, who in the mean time had acted, as
we shall now relate.</p>
               <p>After the Command given to his Son to charge, and that some came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/>
and told him, that the Enemy fled, and that he likewise found himself
not so hardly pressed upon, for indeed they had left him; he took a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
courage, and caused his Army to March into the lower Ground,
hoping his Son would soon return from the pursuit of the Enemy. Mean
while young <hi>Crassus</hi> perceiving himself in danger, dispatch'd away seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Messengers to his Father, to give him notice of it, of whom the first
were slain by the Enemies; and the next, who hardly escaped brought
word, that <hi>Publius</hi> was certainly lost, if not suddenly relieved. Upon
this news the Consul found himself tossed with sundry passions which
blinded his reason, so that he knew not what to resolve on: He was fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of loosing all, if he went to the succour of his Son; yet he loved him,
and therefore was in doubt whether he should go to his relief, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to save the rest. At last he caused the Army to March towards the
Enemy, who presently appeared to meet them; witnessing by their loud
and terrible shouts that they had gained the Victory; and letting the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
know, by the confused noise of their Drums, that they must again
prepare to fight. Thus they made their approach, bearing the Head of
<hi>Publius</hi> upon the end of a Lance, and asking by way of derision, who
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65196:60"/>
were the Parents of that young Man, and of what Family he was? for
they could not believe that <hi>Crassus</hi> the basest of all men could beget a Son
so Brave and Valiant. This sight cast down the spirits of the Romans
more than all the Calamities they had suffered; and instead of stirring up
in them that indignation and desire of revenge, which it ought, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
them with horror and fear. However, <hi>Crassus</hi> Valour appeared
upon this occasion extraordinarily, he cryed out, as he marched on Horse
back through the Ranks:</p>

               <p>After these words <hi>Crassus,</hi> perceiving that most of the Soldiers received
them but coldly, commanded to give a great shout all together, which
made but their inward grief the more known; for they shouted with
weak and discordant Voices, whilst the Barbarians answered them in a
Tone high and Harmonious. The Fight presently began, wherein the
Enemies light Horse wheeling about the Romans, galled them in Flank
with showrs of Arrows, whilst the Lanciers, who assailed them in Front,
made them recoyl and croud close together. However, some out of
fear of the Arrows, drew off from the gross to charge nearer at hand:
but they did their Enemies little<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hurt, and were presently killed by their
Lances, whose Iron head entring the Body, was followed by a thick Staff,
thrust forward with so great violence, that often times it went through
and through both Horse and Man. After the Battel had thus lasted till
night, the Parthians retreated, saying, <hi>That they gave that night to</hi> Crassus
<hi>to bewail his Son, unless he made choice of the better way, and had rather go
and present himself to</hi> Arsaces <hi>than be carried:</hi> And having said these words,
they went and lodged in a place hard by, with full hopes the next Morning
to put an absolute end the Victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> The Romans on the contrary had but an ill night of it, they had no
thoughts either of burying their dead, or dressing their wounded, of
which some lay dying, every one bewailed his own self, for there was no
hopes of safety, whether they staid in that place till day, or whether,
whilst it was dark, they set forward, cross those vast Plains; for the
wounded, if they carried them, would hinder their flight; and if they
forsook them, the cryes of those miserable Creatures would give notice
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65196:60"/>
to the Enemy of their departure: And though they imputed all their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to <hi>Crassus,</hi> they wished, notwithstanding, they might either see
or hear him; but he had withdrawn himself, and with his head bound
up, had cast himself on the ground in the dark. Whereby he became a great
Example of the inconstancy of Fortune to the Vulgar, and of rashness and
ambition to the Learned; having suffered himself to be so far transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by those two failings, that he could not content himself to be one of
the Prime among so many thousands of Citizens, but believed himself
miserable, because he was accounted but the third Man in <hi>Rome. Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
his Lieutenant, and <hi>Cassius</hi> his <hi>Quaestor,</hi> having found him in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
roused him up, and entreated him to take courage; but seeing
he was in utter despair, by advice of the<note n="*" place="margin">Colonels and Captains.</note> Tribunes and Centurions,
they themselves published the Deaf March, and began to discamp with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
noise: but when the sick and wounded perceived that they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to forsake them, with their cryes and roarings they spread a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
trouble throughout the Army, even those who were already got into
the Plain, took the Alarm, as if the Enemy had been ready to fall on:
wherefore they made many halts, putting themselves in order to fight,
and perplexed with the great numbers of the wounded that followed
them, of which they took up some, and left others, they made but little
way, save only three hundred Horse that fled away by themselves, with
whom <hi>Ignatius</hi> arrived about Midnight at <hi>Carres,</hi> where having called in
Latin to those were upon the Guards of the Walls, he bid them go and
tell <hi>Coponius,</hi> the Governour of the place, that there had been a great
Fight between <hi>Crassus</hi> and the Parthians; and without explaining himself
farther, or so much as telling his name, advanced towards the Bridge;
the truth is, he saved those Horse, but he was blamed by all the World
for forsaking his General, not but that <hi>Crassus</hi> had some benefit by <hi>Coponi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
having this advice; for the Governour conjecturing by the ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his words, and by the suddenness of his departure, that the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
brought no good news, immediately drew to Arms what Force he
had; and when he had advice that the General was upon the way, went
out to meet him, and gathering up as many of the Soldiers as he could,
conducted them to the City.</p>
               <p>As for the Parthians, though they knew well that the Romans were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/>
dislodged, yet they would not pursue them by night; but as soon as it
was day, they run to their Camp, and cut the throats of all those they
had left, which amounted to no less than four thousand, and then pursued
the rest, of whom they took great numbers, whom they found dispersed
in the plain; besides four Cohorts, under the conduct of the Lieutenant
<hi>Vargonteius,</hi> who having stragled in the March by night, fell into their
hands enclosed in a strait, where having valiantly defended themselves,
they were all cut in pieces, except only twenty Soldiers, who with their
Swords in their hands opened themselves a passage through the midst of
their Enemies; and whose courage the Enemies themselves admiring,
suffered them to pass at an easie rate to <hi>Carres,</hi> without pursuing them.
Mean while false intelligence was brought to <hi>Surena,</hi> that <hi>Crassus</hi> was
escaped with all the considerable Persons in the Army, and that those who
were retired into <hi>Carres,</hi> were only a company of wretches not worth any
consideration. Which was the reason that not thinking his Victory per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and desiring to have more certain news, he quitted his design of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
<hi>Crassus,</hi> and sent one of his people, who understood both Languages,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65196:61"/>
before the Walls of <hi>Carres,</hi> to ask in Latin either for <hi>Crassus</hi> himself, or
<hi>Cassius,</hi> as if <hi>Surena</hi> desired a conference with them, which being heard,
and told to <hi>Crassus</hi> and his Friends, displeased them not. A little while
after, came on the part of the Barbarians certain Arabs, who knew the
faces of <hi>Crassus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> having frequented their Camp before Battel.
These knowing <hi>Cassius</hi> upon the Wall, told him that <hi>Surena</hi> would grant
Peace to the Romans, provided they would be friends to the King, and
depart out of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> and that they believed they had better accept
of that condition, than reduce things to the last extremities; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Cassius</hi> demanded a time and place for a Conference betwixt the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
and they promising to let <hi>Surena</hi> know it, went their way; <hi>Surena</hi>
rejoying that he had now these two Men now shut up, sent next Morni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the City Walls some Parthians, who injuriously reviling <hi>Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
and <hi>Cassius,</hi> demanded them to be delivered up, if the Romans had
a mind to Peace. And now the Chiefs of the Roman Army knowing
that they were betrayed, fell into despair; but yet consulting what was
best to do, they resolved on a sudden flight, beseeching the Consul to
give over those vain and distant hopes he placed in the assistance of the
Armenians. This design was not to have been communicated to any of
the Inhabitants of <hi>Carres,</hi> before the time of its execution, and <hi>Crassus</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
it to the most per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>idious of them all, called <hi>Andromachus,</hi> to whose
Faith he committed himself, taking him for the Guide of the Army: So
that by the means of this Traytor, all the Roman designs were presently
known to the Parthians. And because these were not accustomed to fight
in the dark, as not easie for them to do, <hi>Andromachus</hi> to retard the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
March, and by that means give the Enemy time to overtake them,
placed himself at the Head of them, going sometimes on one side, and
sometimes on another, till such time as he had engaged them in deep Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
and places full of Ditches, whose high Banks sorely perplexed the
Army, who yet followed this Traytor; insomuch, that they were often
forced to go a great way about to find a passage. This begat a distrust in
some, who imagining by the many twinings and windings, that <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi>
had an ill intention, refused to follow him, of which number was
<hi>Cassius,</hi> who returned to <hi>Carres:</hi> And when his Guides, who were Arabs,
urged him to advance before the Moon had passed <hi>Scorpio: For my part,</hi>
said he to them, <hi>I am much more afraid of</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sagitarious</hi> signifies an Archer.</note> Sagittary. However, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from <hi>Carres,</hi> he took the way towards <hi>Syria,</hi> with five hundred
Horse; and having found faithful Guides, gained the Mountains, called
<hi>Synaces,</hi> where before day, there rallied together about five thousand
Soldiers, conducted by <hi>Octavius,</hi> an excellent Man. As for <hi>Crassus,</hi> day
surprised him, as he followed <hi>Andromachus</hi> with incredible labour. He
was accompanied with four Cohorts with Bucklers; some few Horse, and
five Lictors or Serjeants, with whom having with all the pain and labour
imaginable, overcome the difficulty of the way; the Enemies now drawing
near, he went and possessed himself of an Eminence, distant about<note n="*" place="margin">A Mile and half.</note> twelve
Furlongs from that, to which <hi>Octavius</hi> was retired, but nothing so strong
of situation, nor of so difficult approach for the Horse, but it lay under
the <hi>Synbaces,</hi> to which it was joyned with a long neck, that crossed the
Plain. So that <hi>Octavius</hi> could not be ignorant of the danger in which the
Consul was; wherefore himself ran first to his assistance with a few peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and soon after the rest of his Forces, reproaching each other with
cowardise, followed. They altogether drove the Enemy from the Hill,
and drawing up round about. <hi>Crassus,</hi> and lining their whole Body with
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65196:61"/>
their Bucklers, bravely protested, that no Arrow of the Parthians should
reach their General's Body, so long as one of them remained alive.
Wherefore <hi>Surena,</hi> who saw the Parthians gave ground, and that if night
came on, the Romans, who had already gained the Mountains, would
escape him, assaulted <hi>Crassus</hi> with cunning, he let go some Prisoners, who
had heard some of the Barbarians of purpose saying, <hi>That the King would
not be dissatisfied to have Peace with the Romans, but desired their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and that if he might obtain it by</hi> Crassus <hi>means, he would treat him
favourably.</hi> In the mean time, causing the fight to cease, he after by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little drew near to the Hill, and unbending his Bow, presented
his hand to <hi>Crassus,</hi> desiring him to consent to an accommodation, he told
him that the King having taken up Arms much against his will, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
had made tryal of his Strength and Power, and that now he would
make them taste of his Goodness and Clemency, by showing them his
Favour, and granting security for their Retreat. Not only the soldiers,
but the Leaders glad to hear these fine words of <hi>Surena</hi>'s, easily believed
them. <hi>Crassus</hi> was the only man was not deceived. Indeed he saw no
reason for so sudden a change, wherefore he would not presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
but stood thinking what answer to return, when the Soldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to cry out with one voice, that they would have Peace, and withal
to revile him, for exposing them to men, he durst not himself approach
disarmed, as they were; he endeavoured first to perswade them by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties
and reasons to have patience the rest of that day, since at night
they might easily make their retreat, by gaining the Mountains, he
showed them the way they should take, begging them not to loose all
hopes of safety, which was now so nigh; but when he saw that the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
enraged, threatned him, and smote upon their Bucklers, he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of them, and at parting said only these words to those about
him:</p>

               <p>However, <hi>Octavius</hi> and the rest staid not upon the Hill, but went
down with the Consul, who would not suffer the Lictors to follow him.
As they were going down, two Mongrels or half Greeks came to meet
him, and alighting, made their Reverence to <hi>Crassus,</hi> intreating him to
send some of his people before to view <hi>Surena</hi> and his Train, and espie
if they were not armed. To which the Consul made answer, That if he
had yet the least desire to live, he would not have come to put himself
into their hands. However, he sent the <hi>Riscones</hi> Brothers to spie into
their designs, and discover their number; but <hi>Surena</hi> caused them to be
arrested; and forthwith advancing with the Chief Men of his Army all
mounted on Horse-back towards <hi>Crassus: And how</hi> (said he, coming near
him) <hi>A Roman General on Foot, and we on Horse-back;</hi> and at the same

That neither one nor the other did amiss in that, since each came to
the Conference, after the manner of his Country. <hi>Surena</hi> said, That the
Peace was already concluded between <hi>Orodes</hi> and the people of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and that there wanted nothing but putting the Articles in Writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
they would do on the River side: <hi>For you Romans</hi> (said he) <hi>do not usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remember your Treaties very well;</hi> and at the same instant he gave him
his hand: Thereupon the Roman called out to bring his Horse: To which
<hi>Surena</hi> said, there was no need of it: <hi>For see,</hi> added he, <hi>one which the King
has sent you;</hi> and forthwith one was brought ready Bridled with a Bitt of
Gold, upon which the Footmen mounted him, and placed themselves on
both sides to make him advance forward: whereupon <hi>Octavius</hi> first of
all laid hands upon the Horse Bridle to stop him, and one of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
called <hi>Petronius,</hi> and after him all the rest placed themselves about
the Consul, to hinder his going farther, and to pull away from about him
those that would have led him forward: Insomuch, that thus pushing and
shoving one another, they came at last to blows, <hi>Octavius</hi> drawing his
Sword, slew one of the Barbarian Horsemen, but another slew him with
a blow behind. <hi>Petronius</hi> had no offensive Arms, but having received on
his Cuirass the thrusts made at him, withdrew himself from the bustle
without any wound. As for <hi>Crassus,</hi> he was slain by one <hi>Maxarthes</hi> a
Parthian, though some say it was done by another, and that <hi>Maxarthes,</hi>
as soon as he was down, cut off his head and his right hand: but all
these are conjectures, for of all those that were present, some were slain
upon the place, and the rest nimbly regained the Hill, before which the
Parthians appeared, and called out on the part of <hi>Surena,</hi> that since <hi>Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
was punished, all the rest might come down in safety: Some yielded
themselves, others fled away by night, of which few escaped, being

having beforehand caused a Rumour to be spread abroad at <hi>Seleucia</hi>
that he brought <hi>Crassus</hi> alive, he prepared a certain ridiculous Entry,

of the Prisoners, called <hi>Caius,</hi> who much resembled <hi>Crassus,</hi> and having
cloathed him in a Womans Robe, and taught him to answer to those,

Seleucians upon this took occasion to admire the Wisdom of <hi>Aesop</hi> in
his Fable of the Wallet, seeing that <hi>Surena</hi> carried open in the Pouch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Sensualities of the Milesians, and kept shup up in that behind
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65196:62"/>
the Sybaritick or Effeminate Wantonness of the Parthians, bringing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
himself in his Train, multitudes of Coaches full of Concubines; and
his first appearance being like that of Hydra, dreadful and terrible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
where nothing was to be seen but Horses, and Lances, and Bows, whilst
his tail ended in Cimbals, and Songs, and continual Debauches of Women;
not but that <hi>Rustius</hi> was to be condemned: but the Parthians are in the
wrong to blame what comes from <hi>Miletum;</hi> since most of the Family
of the <hi>Arsacides,</hi> who have been their Kings, were born of Milesian and
Ionian Curtisans. Whilst these things passed, <hi>Orodes</hi> was reconciled with
<hi>Artabasus,</hi> having married his Son <hi>Pacorus</hi> to the Armenians Daughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which was followed by Feastings, Rejoycing, and Debauches. They act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
likewise Greek Comedies, for <hi>Orodes</hi> was not ignorant of the Greek
Tongue, nor of Letters; and for <hi>Artabasus,</hi> he composed both Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
Orations and Histories, part of which have been preserved to our
times. When <hi>Crassus</hi> Head was brought to the entrance of the Court,
they were at Table, and a Comedian, called <hi>Iason</hi> the <hi>Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>llian</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
some Verses of the part of <hi>Agave</hi> in the <hi>Bacchides</hi> of <hi>Euripides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
which much delighted the Company. At the same instant <hi>Sillaces</hi> entred
the Room, where they were at Meat; and making a profound Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
threw down the Head in the middle of the Hall, which being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up by the Parthians with shouts and general rejoycing: the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Officers they should make room for <hi>Sillaces</hi> at the Table, which
they did: then <hi>Iason</hi> giving one of the Players upon the Flute his part
to play the Funerals of <hi>Pentheus;</hi> and himself taking the Head of <hi>Crassus,</hi>
as if he had entred in a fury, began as loud as his voice would reach to sing
these Verses:
<q>
                     <l>From the Chase we bring to you,</l>
                     <l>Tender Venison fat and good,</l>
                     <l>Which was taken in this Wood.</l>
                  </q>
All the Company were pleased at this Spectacle, but one accident
pleased them more; for when at every Couple the Choire answered
singing
<q>'Tis to me the Honour's due.</q>
and that one of the Actors danced to it; <hi>Maxarthes</hi> (for he likewise was
at the Feast) leaped from the Table, and took the Head out of his
hands that held it, as having more right to it than any other. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the King made him Presents according to the
Custom of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and gave <hi>Iason</hi> a Talent. Thus <hi>Crassus</hi> his Expedition ended in a
Tragedy. However, <hi>Orodes</hi> received soon after a punishment equal to
his cruelty, as <hi>Surena</hi> did first, what his so many violated Oaths de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served;
for the King soon after made him away out of the Envy he
bore to his Glory: and for <hi>Orodes,</hi> being fallen sick of the Dropsie,
after that his Son <hi>Pacorus</hi> had been slain in fight against the Romans,
<hi>Phraates</hi> his other Son gave him Poyson, which the force of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
expelled, so that the King grew better upon it, whereupon
<hi>Phraates</hi> would no more trust to Poyson, but taking a shorter way
strangled his Father.</p>
               <p>Sometime after the Parthian Army marched into <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> whither <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:65196:63"/>
their Captains sent for <hi>Labienus,</hi> and chose him General, resolved under
his conduct to invade <hi>Syria;</hi> and carry their Arms as far as <hi>Alexandria.</hi> He
accepted the Dignity, and at the head of that Army had already pillaged
and spoiled all that part of <hi>Asia,</hi> lying between <hi>Euphrates</hi> and the <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea,
when complaints thereof came to <hi>Anthony,</hi> who thereupon took a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to make War upon the Parthians. But being recalled by the prayers
and tears of his <hi>Fulvia,</hi> he returned into <hi>Italy,</hi> where having made an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
with <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> who was in <hi>Sicily,</hi> he sent <hi>Ventidius</hi> before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Asia</hi> to oppose the Parthians, and hinder their further Progress, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
for himself by the favor of his Friends, obtained the Dignity of high
Priest, which was held by the defunct <hi>Caesar,</hi> he stayed sometime in <hi>Rome,</hi>
managing in fellowship with them the Publick affairs with great Concord.
There was at this this time in <hi>Anthony</hi>'s train an Egyptian Astrologer who
(whether it were to gratifie <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> or that it were so indeed) took the
boldness to tell him, that his fortune was indeed very great and splendid,
but that it was obscured by <hi>Caesars,</hi> counselling him to keep as far off that
young Man as he could; <hi>for</hi> said he to him <hi>your Genius is over awed by his.</hi>
This discourse displeased <hi>Anthony,</hi> however he followed the Egyptians
Counsel, and having recommended his affairs to <hi>Caesar,</hi> came into <hi>Greece,</hi>
and stayd that Winter at <hi>Athens,</hi> where having advice of the first success
of <hi>Ventidius</hi> Arms, that not only <hi>Labienus</hi> but <hi>Phraates</hi> the greatest of <hi>Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
Captains were slain, he made a Solemn Feast for the Greeks, and gave
them the Divertisement of Plays and Exercises. And afterward being
ready to set forward to the War, he took a Crown of Sacred Olive, and to
satisfie a certain Oracle, carried along with him a Jar full of the Water of
the Fountain <hi>Clepsydra.</hi> Mean while <hi>Pacorus</hi> the Kings Son, being newly
entred <hi>Syria</hi> with a powerful Army, <hi>Ventidius</hi> defeated him at <hi>Cyrista.</hi> The
slaughter here was very great, and <hi>Pacorus</hi> himself was slain fighting in the
head of his Army, so that this great Victory revenged the loss the Romans
had suffered under <hi>Crassus,</hi> and the Parthians after having been thrice
more beaten, were forced to keep within the bounds of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Meso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia.
Ventidius</hi> would not pursue them farther, lest he should contract
<hi>Anthony</hi>'s envy, yet whilst he expected him, he reduced to obedience those
Cities, had revolted and held <hi>Antiochus Commagenes</hi> besieged in <hi>Samosata</hi> so
closely, that he offered a thousand Talents, and to refer himself to <hi>Anthony</hi>'s
discretion. He was not now far off, wherefore <hi>Ventidius</hi> thought it best
that he should send Deputies to him that he himself might conclude the
peace, being well content that <hi>Anthony</hi> should have the preheminence in
this affair, lest he should think <hi>Ventidius</hi> assumed to himself all the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but the Siege having lasted long, and the besieged out of despair re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
Courage, <hi>Anthony</hi> was satisfied to take up with three hundred Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,
and granted peace to <hi>Antiochus.</hi> Afterward having taken some
order in the Syrian affairs, he returned to <hi>Athens,</hi> giving <hi>Ventidius</hi> all those
testimonies of his Esteem, his Services had merited, and sent him to <hi>Rome</hi>
to receive the Honor of Triumph, and he is the only Roman, who till these
our times ever Triumphed over the Parthians. He was but of mean Birth,
and mounted not to that high degree of Glory, but by the Friendship of
<hi>Anthony,</hi> which he made such good use of, that he confirmed the opinion,
that <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> succeeded more happily by their Lieutenants then
by themselves, for <hi>Sosius</hi> one of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Captains had done Worthy Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in <hi>Syria,</hi> so had likewise <hi>Canidius</hi> in his Station on the Confines of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia,</hi>
having overcome the Kings of <hi>Armenia, Iberia, Albania,</hi> made his way
as far as <hi>Caucasus,</hi> and gained to the name of <hi>Anthony,</hi> Fame and Honor
among the Barbarians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:65196:63"/>
                  <hi>Phraates</hi> having possessed himself of the Estates of his Father <hi>Crodes</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/>
by the Parricide before spoken of, many Parthians left the Kingdom, one of
which called <hi>Moneses,</hi> a Man of Esteem, and Power, addressed himself to
<hi>Anthony,</hi> who comparing the Fortune of this Fugitive with that of <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocles,</hi>
and equalling himself to the Persian Kings both for Riches and
Largness of Mind, gave him three Cities, <hi>Larissa, Arethusa</hi> and <hi>Hierapolis,</hi>
formerly called <hi>Bambice.</hi> Afterwards the King having recalled and given
him security for his return; <hi>Anthony</hi> freely dismissed him, that he might
flatter <hi>Phraates</hi> with hopes of peace; whilst himself out of a passionate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
he had to recover the Ensigns <hi>Crassus</hi> had lost, and the Captives that
were yet living, sends back <hi>Cleopatra</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and by the way of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi>
sets forward towards <hi>Armenia</hi> where he had appointed the Rendevouz
of his Forces and those the Kings were to bring him, for there were many
Friends and Allies of the Romans of whom <hi>Artabasus</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> the
most considerable, furnished him with sixteen thousand Horse and seven
thousand Foot, so that at the Muster taken when his Army was drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
the Roman and Italian Foot, amounted to sixty thousand Men, the
Spanish and <hi>Gaul</hi> Horse to ten thousand, and the Auxiliary Forces to thirty
thousand, accounting the Light-armed Horse and Foot. 'Tis said that all
this great preparation, and all these Forces, which struck terror into the
Bactrians and farthest distant Indians, proved invalid, by the means of
<hi>Cleopatra</hi> only, That <hi>Anthony,</hi> that he might the sooner see her, began the
War without staying for a season proper for the Execution of his designs,
that having as it were his understanding infatuated, he did all things incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderately,
and was so deeply in love with this Woman that he thought
not so much of overcoming as of returning speedily to her. For whereas
he ought to have let his Army Winter in <hi>Armenia,</hi> the better to refresh it,
tyred as it was with a march of<note n="*" place="margin">A thousand M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>les.</note> eight thousand furlongs, and in the Spring
have fallen into <hi>Media,</hi> before the Parthians were in the Field, he could not
brook this delay, but setting forward with his Troops, and leaving <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
on the left hand, and entring into <hi>Atropacena,</hi> spoiled that whole Country,
besides having in his Train three hundred Waggons laden with Engines for
Sieges, among which there was one Ram of seventy Foot long, which
could by no means be repaired if once it were broken, because in those
Countries no Materials were to be found, there neither growing any trees
long enough, nor Wood hard enough: to the end he might march the
swifter, he left behind all these carriages under the Guard of one Officer
with some Forces. After which besieging a great City called <hi>Phraates</hi> in
which was the Wife of the King of the Medes, with his Children, he was
soon sensible what a fault he had committed in leaving behind those Engines;
yet he attempted to take the City by raising Tarasses against the Wall, but
this was a work of labor and advanced but slowly.</p>
               <p>Mean while <hi>Phraates</hi> took the Field with a powerful Army to come <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/>
against the Romans, and having intelligence that they had left behind the
Waggons and Engines, he sent a great Body of Horse, who cut in pieces
<hi>Stratianus</hi> and ten thousand Foot that he Commanded. And after having
taken the Engines slew a great quantity of others of which number was
the King <hi>Polemon,</hi> which disheartned, and not without reason, those who
had engaged in <hi>Anthony</hi>'s party, dismayed at so mournful a beginning;
Insomuch that <hi>Artabasus</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> who had been the Principal
cause of this War giving over all those hopes he had conceived of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65196:64"/>
retired with his Army into his own Country. And now the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
having sent relief into the City with a thousand injurious threats re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled
the Romans, so that <hi>Anthony,</hi> that he might not let the courages of
his Men cool in the Idleness of a Siege, took with him ten Legions, three
Praetorian Cohorts and all his Cavalry to go and gather in Provisions and
Forrage, hoping the Enemy would come to oppose him, and so he might
gain an opportunity to Fight. After his first days march the Parthians ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and he seeing that they began to enlarge their Battail round about
the Roman Camp with design to cut off his way of return, he Commanded
to Sound a March, and to pack up the Tents, as if he were preparing to
discamp, and not to Fight, which done he caused his Army to March be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Enemies in form of a Crescent with Orders to the Cavalry to
charge as soon as the Vanguard was advanced, that so the Legions at the
same time might come to the Charge. The Parthians mean while admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Excellent Order of the Roman Army, seeing the Soldiers pass
along, keeping their Ranks, and Brandishing their Piles without making
the least noise, but as soon as the Signal was given, and the first shout
made, the Roman Horse pressed forward to Charge the Parthians, and came
in so close to them, that they could no more make use of their Arrows.
Yet they stood their ground for some time till the Legionary Soldiers run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in with their shouts, and the noise of their Bucklers, so horribly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
the Horses of the Enemy, that they turned Tail without striking
blow. <hi>Anthony</hi> hoping that this battel would end the War, or at least
give a good stroke towards Victory, pursued them hard. But when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry
had driven them before them<note n="*" place="margin">Above six Miles.</note> fifty furlongs, and the Horse had
followed them, thrice as far<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they found but thirty Prisoners,
and not above fourscore slain, their courages fell at the consideration of
how few they had destroyed in this victory in comparison of the Numbers
they had lost at the defence of the Carriages. Next Morning they advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to go and force <hi>Phraates</hi> his Camp, but meeting in their march at first
with a few Parthians, after that with a greater Number, and at last with
the whole Army, who as if they had not been beaten the day before, came
to the charge and assailed them on all sides, they with much pains and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
recovered their Camp, where the <hi>Medes</hi> whom they besieged, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
stormed the Palisado, and driven off those that defended it, <hi>Anthony</hi>
fell into such a passion that he decimated all those had quitted their Posts,
he drew them off by Decuries or Tens, and making them draw Lots, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
the unfortunate to death, and instead of Wheat gave only Barley
Bread to the rest. This War was troublesome to both parties, and each
feared more grievous consequences. For <hi>Anthony</hi> could no longer go
abroad to seek Provision or Forrage without having some of his People
slain or wounded, and <hi>Phraates</hi> who knew well that the Parthians would
rather endure any thing than to keep the Field all Winter out of their own
Country, was afraid left if the Romans continued the War his People
would forsake him, the Air already growing cold by reason of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal
Equinox. Wherefore he made use of this Artifice. Some Parthians
known to the Romans, meeting them forraging treated them kindly, letting
them go away with their burthens and praising their valor which their
King himself admired, and that with reason, for indeed they were the most
valiant Men in the World, and then by degrees drawing nearer they bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Anthony,</hi> that he would not make peace with the King, and spare the
lives of so many brave people, whom he only suffered to lose time, and
without giving them opportunity of Fighting made them wait for two
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65196:64"/>
cruel Enemies, Famine and Winter, and that in such places as their
March would be difficult, though the Parthians themselves were their
Guides. This being several times reported to <hi>Anthony,</hi> he began to be
more tractable; yet he would not send to the Parthian, till he had caused
inquiry to be made of these honest Barbarians, whether it were by their
Kings Order they had spoke to the Roman Soldiers: which when they had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
it was, conjuring them not to have the least fear or jealousie, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
one of his Friends to the King, to demand the<note n="*" place="margin">Taken in <hi>Crassus</hi> War.</note> Ensigns and the
Captives, that he might not seem to be content with an honourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
only; to which answer was returned, That he should not speak of
that, but that Peace, and a safe Retreat should be granted him, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he would speedily depart, which he did few days after.</p>
               <p>Though he were very Eloquent in all Assemblies, whether Civil or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/>
Military, yet shame and sadness would not let him now speak to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
himself. He gave Commission to <hi>Domitius Aenobarbus</hi> to take his
place, and to exhort the Soldiers to be couragious; some took it ill, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he did it in scorn; but the greater part knowing the cause, the easilier
composed themselves to his thoughts. As he was designing with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to return the way he came through the naked Deserts, a certain Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,
of whose Courage and Fidelity the Romans had trial in the Fight
for defence of the Engines, and who knew the manner of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
living, came to him, and advised him to take his March by the
Foot of the Mountains, which lay on the right hand, and not to expose
his Army loaden with Arms, to such infinite numbers of Archers on
Horse-back in Plains so vast, and without any covert; for that <hi>Phraates</hi>
had no other design, but to fall upon him, when by fair words he had made
him leave his Trenches; and therefore he offered himself, both to lead
them a shorter way, and in which they should find abundance of whatever
was necessary for the Soldiers. <hi>Anthony</hi> proposed this in Council, not
seeming to distrust the Peace agreed on by the Parthians, but telling them
he should be well satisfied to take a shorter way, by which they should find
good Villages, and that nothing else was to be done, but to take good se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of the Mardian: And he of himself desired he might be bound till
they had reached <hi>Armenia;</hi> and thus bound, put himself at the Head of
the Army, and led them two days without any alarm: but on the third,
whilst <hi>Anthony</hi> thought of nothing less than the Parthians; and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the assurance of the Peace, the Army marched without standing on
their Guard, the Mardian espying the Bank of a River newly broken, and
the way, by which they were to pass, full of Water; he judged the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
had done it to put a stop to the Romans, by making difficult the
passage, and showing it to <hi>Anthony,</hi> advised him to prepare to receive the
Enemy. The Roman General presently Martialled his Army, leaving
between the Ranks spaces for the Darters and Slingers to make their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges.
At the same time the Parthians appeared, perswading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
they should now compass in the Army, and defeat them; but the
light-armed Foot drawing off to receive them, charged them so briskly,
that after many wounds given and taken they retreated; yet for several
times they renewed the skirmish, till the Gaul Horse marched against
them in a Body, and treated them so severely, that the remainder of that
day they durst attempt them no more. <hi>Anthony,</hi> by this assault, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what he had to do hereafter, made the Army March in Battalia on
four Fronts, linining not only the Rear, but likewise the Flanks with

Darters and Slingers, and giving Order to the Horse to repulse the Enemy, if
they came to attack them, but not to pursue them too far, after they had
chased them back; so that the Parthians, after having thus followed them
four days with equal loss, began to give it over, and making the ground
of their departure to be the approaching Winter, disposed themselves on
the morrow to leave off the pursuit.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/> The day before they were to be gone, one of <hi>Anthonies</hi> Captains, called
<hi>Flavius Gallus,</hi> a Valiant and Worthy Man, requested a greater number
of the Light-armed Foot, for defence of the Rearguard, and some part
of the Calvalry from the Wings, as if he had some brave exploit to put
in execution. Having obtained his desire, he set himself to chase back
the Enemies, that came to skirmish, not as before, retreating in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as soon as he had made them give ground; but charging them home,
and obstinately maintaining the Fight, which being observed by those who
maintained the Rearguard, they recalled him for fear lest being divided
from the Army, the Enemy should encompass him. 'Tis said farther,
that <hi>Titius</hi> the Questor staid the Ensigns to make him return, reproving
him for loosing so many brave Men; but that <hi>Gallus</hi> quarrelling with him,
and bidding him meddle with his own Affairs, he left him, and joyned with
the main Body. <hi>Gallus</hi> charging forward on the Enemy, with two
much heat, found himself beset in the Rear, and on all sides oppressed
with Showers of Arrows, so that he was forced to send for aid; in which
the Colonels of the Legions, and among the rest <hi>Canidius,</hi> who had much
power with <hi>Anthony,</hi> seem to have committed a great fault; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
they ought to have marched with all their Force thither, they sent
only some few Cohorts; and as those were defeated, others, not observing
that by this means the Army would by little and little be put to the rout,
and had been so, if <hi>Anthony</hi> himself had not speedily made in with all
the Vanguard; but now the third Legion advancing athwart the Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and standing the shock of the Enemy, stop'd them short, and hindred
their passing farther. There were no less than three thousand men slain
in this Engagement, and five thousand brought off wounded, among
whom was <hi>Gallus</hi> thrust through and through with four Arrows, of which
he dyed not long after. <hi>Anthony</hi> went among the Tents to visit the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
comforting them, and weeping himself out of grief and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
but they rejoycing to see him, took him by the hand, and pray'd
him to take care of his own health, and not afflict himself any more.
They called him their Emperour, and told him their wounds were all
healed, whilst they saw him well. And indeed, there appears not in all
that Age to have been any General that had an Army so vigorous, so
brave, and so patient; and if we have regard to the respect and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
they bore him, as well great as small, Officers as Soldiers, and the
high account they made of his favour, preferring it before their own
safety, or their very lives; certainly he yielded to none of the Ancient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
and surely they were disposed to it by many Motives, by his Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
his Eloquence, his Uprightness, his Liberality both frequent and
great; and by the sweetness of his familiar Conversation: but above all
his tenderness and compassion for the afflicted, and the care he took to
see them furnished with all things necessary, made the sick and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
almost as well satisfied, as if they had been well. Now this Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
had so raised the Enemies hearts, before almost tired and despairing,
that they passed that night near the Camp in hopes e'er long to be plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65196:67"/>
the Publick Treasure and find the Tents deserted. On the morrow
they assembled in far greater Numbers, so that it is thought they could not
be less then forty thousand Horse; for the King sent those of his own train
one after another, as to an evident and assured victory (for as for himself
he never engaged in person.) In the mean time <hi>Anthony</hi> designing to make
an Oration to his Soldiers would have put on a sad coloured habit to move
the more Compassion, but his Friends diswading him from it, he came to
the Assembly in the Habit of General, he praised those had behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
well, and declaimed against those that fled, of whom the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
him to be of good Courage, and the last having given reasons for
their flight offered themselves to be decimated or what other punishment
he pleased, so that he would forbear to afflict himself, and to look ill upon
them. Thereupon lifting up his eyes to heaven, he besought the Gods,
that if any Divinity were jealous of his past happiness, they they would let all
the miseries wherewith he was threatned to fall upon his own head, and
give Victory to the rest of the Army. The next day they again set forward
in better Order, so that the hopes of the Parthians who a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ailed them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to decay, for they thought they were come to Pillage and Plunder and
not to fight; but finding themselves stiffly beat back by the Roman Piles,
which the Soldiers now discharged with a wonderful Alacrity, they once
again were forced to give ground. Yet ceased they not from following the
Roman Army, and one day as they galled them with their Arrows, whilst
they were descending a little Hill, the Targetiers faced about, and after
having received the light Armed Foot into the Ranks, set their Knees to
the ground, and Ranging their Bucklers one above another, formed a
<note n="*" place="margin">So called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance to a Tortoise shell.</note> Testudo, where the Bucklers rising by degrees Resembled in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the Seats of a Theater. And indeed this was an Excellent Rampire
against the Arrows for they slid away on both sides the Testudo. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians
thinking the Romans were thus set down out of weariness, giving over
their Bow's came to charge them at Push of Pike, but they Rising all at once
and giving a great shout, with their Piles broke the foremost Ranks, and
forced the rest to Flight.</p>
               <p>But in the mean time Famine began sorely to oppress the Army, for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVIII"/>
Soldiers being continually in Fight, could not range abroad for Provisions,
besides there wanted Mills, the greatest part being left behind because either
Beasts of Carriage were dead, or imployed to carry the sick and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so that 'tis said a Bushel of Wheat, <hi>Athens</hi> Measure, was sold for fifty
Drams, and Barly Bread for its weight in Silver, they were forced at last
to eat Roots and Herbs, and because they found but few that were known
they were necessitated to make experiment of all they met with, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
fell upon an Herb that caused Madness, and in the conclusion
proved death, for as soon as any had eaten of it, they lost their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Memory, and fell to turning upside down, and removing all the
Stones they met with, believing they were at work upon some very serious
matter, so that all the Camp was filled with People rooting up, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Stones from one place to another, who at last died vomiting of
Cholor. Wine was the Cure for this Distemper, but it was not to be
had, insomuch that 'tis said <hi>Anthony</hi> seeing so many of his People die, and
the Parthians still at his heels, often cryed out, <hi>Oh the ten thousand!</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
those ten thousand Men who under the Conduct of <hi>Xenophon</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a much longer way making their retreat from the Plains of <hi>Babylon</hi> to
the Sea without loosing so much as one Man though in their way they
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65196:68"/>
were often assaulted by far greater Numbers of Enemies. The Parthians
seeing they could not hinder the Romans March, nor engage them to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
one from the other, and that they had been often beaten, began again
to talk civilly to those, went abroad for Corn and Forrage, showing them
their unbent Bows and telling them that now they might freely go, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there appeared only some <hi>Medes,</hi> who passed a day or two's march
farther, without committing any Act of Hostility, but only under pretence
to secure the Towns distant from the great Road. After these Civilities
and Fair words, the Romans were somewhat more hearty. <hi>Anthony</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
grew a little pleasant and began to have some inclination for the way
of the plain, because it was told him, that there was greater conveniency
of Water then in the Mountains. As he had resolved it, one of the Enemies
called <hi>Mithridates,</hi> Cousin to that <hi>Moneses</hi> who had fled for refuge to
<hi>Anthony,</hi> and to whom he had given three Cities, came to the Camp, and
asked for any one that could talk with him, either in the Syrian or Parthian
Tongue. <hi>Alexander</hi> of the City of <hi>Antioch</hi> a trusty Friend of <hi>Anthonies</hi>
presenting himself, the Parthian after having told him, that what he did
was for <hi>Moneses,</hi> sake, asked him if he saw far afore those high Mountains
that touched one another. He making Answer he saw them well. The
Parthians (said the other) lie there in Ambush with all their Forces (for
this Plain extends it self as far as those Mountains) and there they wait
for you out of hopes that giving credit to their fair words, you will leave
your Road to Cross the Plain. In the other way you have nothing to suffer
but Labor and Thirst to which you are already accustomed, but if you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in this, <hi>Anthony</hi> will scarce come better off then <hi>Crassus.</hi> And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
said thus much he departed. This being reported to <hi>Anthony</hi> he was
afraid, and conferred with his Friends, and with the <hi>Mardian,</hi> whom he
found of the same judgment, for he knew that the way of the Plain though
there were no Enemy to be feared, was hard to find, and many difficult
passes whilst all the inconvenience of the other was want of water only for
one days march. Determining therefore to take the way of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and to depart the same night, Orders were given to the Soldiers to
furnish themselves with water, and because the most part wanted Vessels,
they filled their Head-pieces and certain skins sewed together. The Army
was already set forward, when the Parthians having intelligence of it,
contrary to their custom followed them by night. About break of day they
came up with the Rearguard, and fell upon them, tired as they were with
Travel and want of sleep, for that night the Romans had marched<note n="*" place="margin">Thirty Miles, a thing almost incredible though so good an Historian write it.</note> two
hundred and forty Furlongs, and did not believe the Enemy could be so
soon upon them, which made them almost loose their Courage, besides
their thirst encreased with their Fight, being forced to fight and march
together. Mean while the Vanguard met with a River clear and cool,
but whose salt and venemous waters, ulcerated the bowels as soon as they
were drunk, and provoked an intolerable thirst. The <hi>Mardian</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
notice to the Soldiers of it, but that could not hinder them, though he
forbad it never so much from drinking. <hi>Anthony</hi> himself came amongst
them, and conjured them to have yet a little patience, shewing them
that they were not far from another River where they might drink, and
that henceforward the way was craggy and unaccessible for Horse, and
therefore the Enemy must of necessity retire; at the same time he caused
the Retreat to be Sounded, that at least the Soldiers might a little refresh
themselves in the shade.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:65196:68"/>
As they pitch'd their Tents, and that the Parth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to their Custom. <hi>Mithridates</hi> came again, and <hi>Alexander</hi> going
out to meet him, he advised him to raise the Camp, after the Army had
never so little refreshed themselves, and to march with all the speed they
could past the other River, for that was the bounds of the Parthians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
which they wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he sent to the Parthians by <hi>Alexander</hi> Cups and Vessels of Gold, of which
he took as much as his Coat would cover. The rest of this days March
was without any Alarm, but the night following was troubled by the
Romans themselves, who made it both hurtful and dangerous; for they
killed those who had any Gold or Silver to rob them, plundered the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Treasury loaden on the Beasts of Carriage, and at last, <hi>Anthony</hi>'s ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Equipage, even to his necessary Vessels and Tables of inestimable price,
which the Thieves broke in pieces, and divided amongst them, that
occasioned so great a tumult, and so strange an affright (for they thought
the Enemy already master of the Baggages) that <hi>Anthony</hi> having called
to him one of his Guards, named <hi>Ramnus,</hi> who was his freed Man, he
forced him to promise him upon Oath to run him through with his Sword,
as soon as he should command it, and to cut off his Head, lest he should
fall into the power of the Enemy, or be known when he was dead. This
discourse having drawn tears from <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Friends: The Mardian came
to intreat him to take Courage, by telling him, that by a certain moist and
fresh Wind very pleasant to the Nostrils, he knew well they were not
for from the River, which he guessed besides by the length of the way they
had gone; and the time (for the night was far spent) At the same time
they brought him word, that all the Tumult was occasioned by the ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
of the Soldiers, who had plundered one another; wherefore that he
might put in order this troubled and dispersed multitude, he made a halt;
about break of day, the Tumult being quite calmed, every one began to
fall into his Rank, when on a sudden the Rearguard felt the Parthian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows;
the Light-armed Foot was presently commanded out, and the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getiers,
as before, formed a Testudo against the Enemies shot, who durst
not approach them too nigh. At last, having fought in this manner for
some little way, the Vanguard perceived the River, where being arrived,
the Horse was sent out against the Parthians, and they began to pass over
the sick. The Fight by little and little grew colder, for the Parthians at
the sight of the River unbent their Bows, telling the Romans they might
pass without any fear, and highly commending their Courage: When
they were got on the other side, they reposed themselves at leisure, then
set forward on their March, not confiding too much in the words of the
Parthians; and six days after their last Fight, they arrived on the Banks
of <hi>Araxis,</hi> a River which divides <hi>Media</hi> from <hi>Armenia,</hi> they thought it
both deep and rapid; and there was a rumour spread, that the Enemy
was coming to encounter them at their passage: but after they had happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
crossed it, and saw themselves in security, in the Territories of <hi>Armenia,</hi>
as if they had gained a Port after a Storm; they adored the Earth, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
one another, and weeping for joy; yet it happened, that coming
into a Country abundant in all things, after so long a scarcity, they so
overcharged their Stomachs, that many of them fell sick, either of the
Dropsie or Colick. <hi>Anthony,</hi> out of danger, took a Muster of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and found that he had lost in this Expedition twenty thousand Foot,
and four thousand Horse, of which more than half dyed of sickness. Since
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65196:69"/>
his departure from about <hi>Phraates</hi> till this time, he had made seven and
twenty days March without resting, during which he had fought eighteen
times against the Parthians with advantage: But these Victories were to
no purpose; for not being able to pursue the Enemies far after he had
routed them, they remained imperfect. Now it is firmly believed, that
<hi>Artabasus,</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> was the cause that <hi>Anthony</hi> gained not an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Victory; for had he had with him the sixteen thousand Horse
armed after the manner of the Parthians, and accustomed to fight with
them, which that King led back out of <hi>Media,</hi> the Parthians so many
times overcome, could never have rallied, because that after the Romans
had routed them, the Armenians following the chase, had made it a perfect
Victory. Wherefore all men advised <hi>Anthony</hi> to punish <hi>Artabasus;</hi> but
he thought he did more prudently, not to reproach him with his perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
On the contrary, he remitted nothing of the Honour and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he usually shewed him, because he saw his Army weak, and in a tyred
condition: but making another Voyage into <hi>Armenia,</hi> he obliged him by
fair words to come and meet him; and having arrested him, led him
Captive to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whither he entred in Triumph, which much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
the Romans, who were vexed that he communicated the Honours
of their Cities to the Egyptians: but this happened in the time of the
Declination of the Republick. After this, the Kings of the Medes and
Parthians quarrelled about the Roman Spoils; wherefore the Median see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself the weakest, and fearing to loose his Kingdom, sent to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
to engage him to begin the War afresh, offering him to that effect
his Forces, and his Alliance. Upon these offers the Roman conceived
great hopes, because he believed that to have subdued the Parthians, he
wanted nothing but Archers and Horsemen, which now offered of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
he was therefore resolved to pass into <hi>Armenia,</hi> with design to

prevented by the dissentions of <hi>Octavius</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> he referred this
Expedition to another Season, though 'tis said the Parthians were at this
time divided among themselves. He notwithstanding once afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Media,</hi> where having contracted an Alliance and Friendship
with that King, he demanded one of his Daughters, whom he married
to one of his Sons he had by <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> and that done, he returned,
because of the Civil Wars, which now began to break out into a
flame.</p>

                  <hi>MIthridates</hi> being dead, after having maintained War against
the Romans for two and forty years; they added to their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<hi>Bithynia, Caappdocia,</hi> and all the Neighbouring Nations
bordering on the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea: and as the putting an end to
this War, raised their Courage; so they subdued, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fequence
to it, all the rest of <hi>Cilicia;</hi> the Provinces of <hi>Syria,</hi> which are
<hi>Phoenicia, Coelosyria</hi> and <hi>Palestine,</hi> with all the Upland nigh the <hi>Euphrates,</hi>
which were never possessed by <hi>Mithridates:</hi> They imposed Tributes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
on some of these people, but subjected not others to it, till some time
after. As for <hi>Paphlagonia, Galatia, Phrygia,</hi> the <hi>Mysia</hi> contiguous to it,
together with <hi>Lydia, Ionia, Caria,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> which depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the Kingdom of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> with the old <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Macedon,</hi> of
which <hi>Mithridates</hi> was seised, they reduced them under their obedience,
and imposed Tributes on several Nations, that had never before paid them
any. 'Tis for these Reasons (as I imagine) they esteemed this War of such
importance to them, that they termed this Victory so Magnificent; and
that they gave (which remains to this our age) that General, under whose
Conduct they had performed all these brave Actions, the sirname of Great,
because of the great numbers of Provinces, he either restored to their Empire,
or added by Conquest: besides, also for the length of this War, and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity
of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who was both powerful and indefatigable, (as he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
made appear) for he had more than four hundred Ships of his own,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65196:70"/>
and hath somteimes had in Arms fifty thousand Horse, and two hundred
and fifty thousand Foot, with all Engines of War, and Arms necessary for
so great a Multitude. He was likewise supported by the Kings and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns
of <hi>Armenia, Scythia,</hi> and all those Nations inhabiting from <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and the <hi>Palus Maeotis</hi> to the Thracian <hi>Bosphorus.</hi> He was sent
likewise to make Alliance with some of the principal men of <hi>Rome,</hi> who
were then engaged in a troublesome Civil War, and some of which had
siesed on <hi>Spain,</hi> he treated with the Gauls, that on that side he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
<hi>Italy.</hi> He likewise filled the Sea from <hi>Gallicia</hi> to the Pillars of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi>
with Pyrates, who disturbing Navigation, and hindring Traffick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Cities, caused for a long time great scarcity of Provisions. In
short, he did and attempted all that was possible. Insomuch, that all the
people, from the East to the West, found themselves, or sent Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Troops, or were tormented by the Corsaires, or by their Neighbours,
or else for their Neighbours sakes: So many different interests there were
in this War. The Romans alone gain'd advantage by it: For after it was
finished, they extended their Empire from the West, as far as <hi>Euphrates.</hi>
I could not possibly divide by Provinces what passed in each, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the most considerable Actions were done at the same time, and are
link'd one within another: But I have treated of them apart where ever
they would admit of a separation.</p>
               <p>The Greeks are of opinion, that the Thracians, who went to the Wars <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
of <hi>Troy</hi> under <hi>Rhaesus</hi> (their Captain being by night slain by <hi>Diomedes,</hi> as
<hi>Homer</hi> says) retired themselves to the Mouth of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, where
there is but a small strait to pass over into <hi>Thrace;</hi> but for want of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
a part of them staid there, and called the Country <hi>Bebrycia;</hi> and the
rest pass'd over above <hi>Byzantium,</hi> to the place where the Bithynian Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
inhabit, near the River <hi>Bithyas;</hi> from whence being forced by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
they returned to <hi>Bebricia,</hi> whose name they changed, and called it
<hi>Bithynia,</hi> from the name of the River they had left, and that name did
perpetuate in their Descendants, there not being very great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Bithynia</hi> and <hi>Bebricia.</hi> This is the opinion of some: Others say
that <hi>Bithys,</hi> the Son of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Thrace,</hi> was the first King of <hi>Thrace</hi>
and <hi>Bithynia,</hi> who gave names to these Regions. I was willing to say
thus much of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> by way of Preface; and I believe it likewise ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
being writing the Roman History, to say somewhat of the nine
and forty Kings that Reigned in this Kingdom, before the Romans became
Masters of it. <hi>Prusias,</hi> sirnamed the Hunter, had married the Sister of
<hi>Perseus,</hi> King of <hi>Macedon.</hi> However, when the War happened between the
Romans, and his Wives Brother, he remained Neuter; and yet after <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus</hi>
was taken Prisoner, he went and presented himself before the Roman
Captains, (in his Gown and Slippers, with a Hat on, and his Head shaven,
just like those Slaves, to whom their Masters had given liberty by will;
and to all this ridiculous dress, he had a villanous aspect, and was very low
of stature) when he came near the Captains, he told them in Latin, <hi>I am
the freed man of the people of</hi> Rome: at which they burst out in a laughter,
and sent him to the City, and he appearing the same ridiculous Creature
at <hi>Rome,</hi> obtained favour. Not long after, being fallen at variance with
<hi>Attalus,</hi> King of that part of <hi>Asia,</hi> which lyes about <hi>Pergamus,</hi> he in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile
manner invaded his Country; which being come to the Senates
knowledge, Deputies were sent to him, forbidding him to proceed any
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65196:71"/>
farther in a War against <hi>Attalus,</hi> Friend and Allie of the people of <hi>Rome;</hi>
and when he seemed somewhat unwilling to obey the Deputies, vigorously
charged him, either to comply with the Orders of the Senate, or come
only with a thousand Horse upon the Frontier, where <hi>Attalus</hi> expected
him with a like number to decide the difference by Combat; he despising
the small numbers that were with <hi>Attalus,</hi> and hoping by this means
easily to defeat him, sent some of his before to give notice, that he would
be suddenly at the place appointed with his thousand Horse: but he came
with his whole Army, as if he were to give Battel. <hi>Attalus,</hi> and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Commissaries, who had intelligence of it, escaping several ways, he
came and took their Baggage, which they were forced to leave behind,
and went and besieged a City, called <hi>Nicephoria,</hi> took it, rased it, and
set fire on their Temples. After which he pursued <hi>Attalus</hi> so close, that
he block'd him up in <hi>Pergamus.</hi> Hereupon the Senate sent other Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
who ordered him to pay all the damages <hi>Attalus</hi> had sustained in this
War, which so terrified him, that he obeyed, retired, and for interest
delivered up immediately to <hi>Attalus</hi> twenty Ships with Decks, and agreed
to pay him at a certain day, five hundred Talents of Silver, according
to the Order of the Commissaries. He was very cruel, and therefore
hated by his Subjects; but his Son <hi>Nicomede</hi> was extremely beloved, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Father growing jealous, sent him to sojourn at <hi>Rome;</hi> from
whence, hearing that he was there likewise in good esteem, he gave him
Commission to demand of the Senate a release of the money he still owed to
<hi>Attalus.</hi> He had sent <hi>Menas</hi> to assist him in the soliciting the Affair,
with private Order to say nothing to his Son, if it were granted; but if
it were denyed, to kill him in the City; and to favour his retreat, after
the Murder, he caused to lye ready near unto <hi>Rome</hi> some Ships with two
thousand Soldiers. <hi>Menas</hi> seeing the release would not be granted, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Andronicus</hi> sent by <hi>Attalus</hi> to oppose the Demand, had made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that the sum adjudged came far short of the damages he had sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
and that on the other side <hi>Nicomedes</hi> was much esteemed at <hi>Rome,</hi>
knew not what to resolve on. He durst neither undertake to kill him,
nor to return into <hi>Bithynia.</hi> In short, he staying at <hi>Rome</hi> after his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
was expired, the young Prince came to see him, at which he was
not at all displeased. They conspired against <hi>Prusias,</hi> and associated in
the conspiracy <hi>Andronicus,</hi> the Envoy of <hi>Attalus,</hi> to the end he might
perswade his Master to assist <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> and to put him in possession of
the Kingdom of <hi>Bithynia.</hi> They came to this end together to <hi>Bernice,</hi>
a little City of <hi>Epire,</hi> where meeting together on board by night to consult
what they had to do, after the Conference they parted every one to
his own Ship. Morning being come, <hi>Nicomede</hi> appeared on the Hatches,
in a Purple Robe, with a Diadem round his Head, after the manner of
Kings. <hi>Androni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns</hi> goes to him, and salutes him in the Quality of King,
and with five hundred Soldiers he had there, joyns himself to his Train.
<hi>Menas</hi> seems surprised, as if he had not known of <hi>Nicomedes</hi> being there,
and conferring with his two thousand Soldiers, seems at first extremely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged;
but after some discourse, <hi>Of two Kings which we have</hi> (said he) <hi>the
one is at home, the other is abroad, wherefore consider what you are to do for
the future, and consider well, since on this opportunity depends your safety. I am
of the opinion we ought to stick to him, who is likeliest to become Master; one
is old, the other young; one is hated by the Bithynians, they desire the other;
the most considerable persons of</hi> Rome <hi>love the young Man;</hi> Andronicus, <hi>who
has joyned with him, promises the assistance of King</hi> Attalus, <hi>the next Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65196:71"/>
to</hi> Bithynia, <hi>a powerful and ancient Enemy of</hi> Prusias. To this he
added the cruelty of the old King, the violence he had committed, the
indignities he had done to an infinite number of people: and in short, the
publick hatred. And perceiving that the Soldiers did, as well as himself,
abhorr his Crimes, he led them to <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> and was the next after <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus</hi>
that saluted him King, and submitted to him with his two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Men. <hi>Attalus</hi> gladly received this young Prince, who went forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to him, and sent to summon <hi>Prusias</hi> to give his Son some Cities for
his Residence, and some Lands for his Maintenance. He made answer,
That he would e'er long give him all <hi>Attalus</hi> his Kingdom, to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
of which, he was already come into <hi>Asia:</hi> And therewithal sends
to <hi>Rome,</hi> to make complaint of <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and <hi>Attalus,</hi> and to cite them
to judgement. But <hi>Attalus</hi> entred immediately into <hi>Bithynia,</hi> with those
Forces he had in readiness, where by little and little, all the people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
for <hi>Nicomedes.</hi> As for <hi>Prusias,</hi> not trusting in any person, and
hoping the Romans would disingage him of this Affair, he obtained from
<hi>Digilles</hi> the Thracian, his Father-in-law, five hundred Soldiers, with
whom he confided the guard of his person, and shut himself up in the
Fortress of <hi>Nicea.</hi> The Deputies of <hi>Prusias</hi> being come to <hi>Rome,</hi> the
Pretor of the City, for some time, delay'd their Audience, because he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<hi>Attalus</hi> his concerns. At length having introduced them into the
Senate, he had Orders to make choice of three Commissioners to put an
end to this War. He chose three, of which one having formerly received
a blow on the Head with a Stone, the Scars still remained, which made
his Visage deformed; the second was lame of his Feet; and the third was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
better than a Fool; which made <hi>Cato,</hi> scoffing at this Deputation, say,
That it had neither Head, Feet, nor Soul. The Commissaries being gone
to <hi>Bithynia,</hi> ordered the Kings to lay down their Arms, upon which <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedes</hi>
and <hi>Attalus</hi> made a shew of yielding to the Authority of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:
but the Bithynians, whom they had suborned, loudly declared, That
they should never be able to undergo the cruelty of <hi>Prusias,</hi> especially now
he had known their aversion to him: wherefore, because the Senate had
yet heard nothing of these complaints, and so the Commissaries could
have no Orders concerning them, they returned without doing any thing.
<hi>Prusias</hi> seeing himself frustrated of the Romans assistance, on the reliance
of which he had made no preparations, retired to <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> a very strong
place, where he resolved to sustain a Siege; but the Inhabitants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
their King, opening the Gates, and letting in <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and his
Army; and <hi>Prusias</hi> taking Sanctuary in the Temple of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> was slain
by orders of his Son. Thus <hi>Nicomedes</hi> began to Reign in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of his Father. After him his Son <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Philopator</hi>
succeeded, and was confirmed in his Kingdom by Decree of the Senate.
Such was the State of Affairs in <hi>Bithynia;</hi> and if any desire to know
more, the Grand-child of this last, called likewise <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> by his
last Will and Testament, appointed the people of <hi>Rome</hi> Heir to this
Kingdom.</p>
               <p>As for what concerns <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> I cannot certainly say upon whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
it depended before the time of the Macedonians, whether it had particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Kings, or were a Province of <hi>Darius</hi> his Kingdom: But it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that <hi>Alexander,</hi> going to War against <hi>Darius,</hi> left these people Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary
under their own Princes, because we find that he restored <hi>Amisa,</hi>
a City which had been a Colony of the Athenians, to a popular admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65196:72"/>
according to the Custom of the Ancestors. The Historian <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronymus</hi>
says, He did not so much as come near these Nations; and that
to encounter <hi>Darius,</hi> he took his March nearer the Sea by <hi>Pamphilia</hi> and
<hi>Cilicia. Perdiccas,</hi> who commanded the Macedonians after <hi>Alexander,</hi>
took <hi>Ariarathes,</hi> Governour of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and hanged him; whether it
were for revolting, or to reduce that Country under the Macedonian
Dominion, I know not. He gave to <hi>Eumenes</hi> of <hi>Crdis</hi> the Government
of the Province, who having been slain for shaking off the Macedonian
Yoke; <hi>Antipater,</hi> who had the Administration of the Affairs of <hi>Macedon</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Perdiccas,</hi> sent <hi>Nicanor Satrapas</hi> into <hi>Cappadocia.</hi> Some time after
dissension happening among the Macedonians themselves, <hi>Antigonus</hi>
drove <hi>Laomedon</hi> out of his Government of <hi>Syria,</hi> and seised it. Now he
had for his particular Friend, <hi>Mithridates</hi> of the Blood Royal of <hi>Persia,</hi> and
once sleeping, he dream'd that he sowed Gold in a Field, and <hi>Mithrida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
gathered it, and carryed it to <hi>Pontus,</hi> upon which he made him
Prisoner, and would have put him to death, but he escaped, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only with six Horsemen, and fortifying himself in a certain Village of <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia,</hi>
many others came in to him, and whilst the Macedonians were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in other Affairs, made himself Master of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
neighbouring on <hi>Pontus.</hi> At length having mightily extended his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
he left to his Children a great scope of Country, over which they
Reigned one after another, till this <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who had War with the
Romans. But both the Kingdoms of <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> having been
joyntly possessed by the Successors of the first <hi>Mithridates;</hi> it is of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to know how they came divided, and who were Kings of <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and who of <hi>Cappadocia.</hi> The first, under whom the change began, was
<hi>Mithridates Euergetes,</hi> who only stiled himself King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> hating
the Cappadocians, and treating them like a conquered Country. He had
made an Alliance with the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and did effectually send them
Auxiliary Shipping against the Carthaginians. There succeeded him his
Son of the same name, with two sirnames, <hi>Eupator</hi> and <hi>Dionysius,</hi> whom
the Romans commanded to quit <hi>Cappadocia</hi> to <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> who had put
himself under the protection of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and seemed to have
more right to that Kingdom than the other. It's possible too, that being
jealous of the greatness of <hi>Mithridates</hi> Monarchy, they were glad of this
pretence to divide it. However it were, the King obey'd. But <hi>Socrates,</hi>
sirnamed <hi>Chrestus</hi> (Brother of <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> the Son of the first <hi>Nicomedes,</hi>
and Grandchild to <hi>Prusias,</hi> the same that had been confirmed in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Bithynia</hi> by the Decree of the Senate) having some controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
with his Brother, was assisted by <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who sent him with an
Army into <hi>Bithynia,</hi> where he seised on the Kingdom, and at the same
time <hi>Mithraas</hi> and <hi>Bagoas,</hi> having driven <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> wherein the Romans had established him, placed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riarathes</hi>
in his stead. So that the Romans found themselves obliged to
restore <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> each to his Kingdom. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
they sent their Commissaries, of whom <hi>Manius Aquilius</hi> was the
Chief, and gave Orders to <hi>L. Cassius,</hi> who commanded in that part of <hi>Asia,</hi>
with a little Army to assist them; and likewise gave the same commands
to <hi>Eupator</hi> himself: but he, who had still a pretence to <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
that not long since the Romans had despoiled him of <hi>Phrygia</hi> (as
we have said in our History of the Affairs of <hi>Greece)</hi> would not concern
himself. However, <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Manius</hi> with those Forces <hi>Cassius</hi> had, and
what they could raise in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> re-established <hi>Nicomedes</hi> in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65196:72"/>
                  <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and afterwards counselled them both to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions
into <hi>Mithridates</hi> his Country, and to pick with him any occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of War, assuring them that the Romans assistance should not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
yet neither of them durst attempt so powerful an Enemy: but when the
Commissaries again pressed them to it; <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> who owed a great sum
of Money to the Commissaries, and the Captains, by the agreement made
for his re-establishment; and had likewise formerly taken up great sums
at interest from the Romans setled in <hi>Asia,</hi> who now called them in, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
(as it were whether he would or no) the Territories of <hi>Mithridates,</hi>
pillaging all as far as the Gates of the City of <hi>Amestris,</hi> without any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
For though the King of <hi>Pontus</hi> had very good Forces rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
yet he still gave ground, that he might make his tale the
better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> Nicomedes <hi>being returned with a booty of inestimable value,</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
                  <hi>sent</hi> Pelopidas <hi>to the Roman Captains and Commissaries, and
though he knew they wished for the War, and had been the cause of this
invasion, he took no notice of it, expecting greater and more worthy
causes of the War that was preparing. He gave him in charge only to
speak of that Friendship and Alliance he and his Father had with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of</hi> Rome. <hi>But (said</hi> Pelopidas) instead of Protecting him, you have
taken from him <hi>Phrygia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> of which this last was the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of his predecessors, and left to him by succession from his Father; and the
other the recompense of his Victory over <hi>Aristonicus,</hi> a recompense he received
from your General, or rather which he bought with his mony; and now you
suffer <hi>Nicomedes</hi> to stop up his passage from <hi>Pontus,</hi> and spoil all his Country
as far as the Gates of <hi>Amestris.</hi> Not but that the King was as you know suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
powerful, and too well prepared to resist him, but he would have you
eye witnesses of what has passed. And now you have seen it, <hi>Mithridates</hi> your
Friend and Allie, begs you in quality of his Friends and Allies (for those
are the Terms of the Treaty) to succour those <hi>Nicomedes</hi> thus wrongs, or at
least impeach his farther violence. <hi>To this the Deputies from</hi> Nicomedes
<hi>made Answer.</hi> That it was not at this instant only, that <hi>Mithridates</hi> had
laid Ambushes for him, that he had made <hi>Socrates</hi> his Brother to enter in
Hostile manner into his Kingdom, who but for him had been quiet, and yielded
to the right of Primogeniture in his Elder Brother. 'Tis most true Gentlemen
<hi>(said the Chief of this deputation) Mithridates</hi> alone stirr'd up that young
Man to make War against him, whom the Senate and People of <hi>Rome</hi> had
made King of <hi>Bithynia;</hi> To whom do you think this injury was meant more
than to you? and though by your Edict the Kings of <hi>Asia</hi> are forbid to meddle
with <hi>Europe,</hi> he with the same injustice has seised several places in the <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonesus;</hi>
all these Actions are but Signals of the violence he intends to you. You
may if you please wait for the effects; for what mean his great preparations
as if the War were already Declared? Why so many Auxiliary Troops of
Thracians, Scythians, and so many other Neighboring Nations? He allies
himself with the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> sends Agents into <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite
the Alliance of those Kings, has already three hundred Ships of War
fitted, and is still building more, having fetcht from <hi>Phoenicia</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi>
Mariners and Pilots; such mighty preparations are never made against
<hi>Nicomede,</hi> but against you. He is exceeding angry too, that having bought
<hi>Phrygia</hi> of one of your Generals, that suffered himself to be over-reacht, you
have commanded him to restore it as goods unjustly got. And as much vexed he
is that you have given <hi>Cappadocia</hi> to <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> and fearing lest your
power should encrease from day to day, the complaints he makes to you, serve
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65196:73"/>
him only for a pretence to Arm, and assault you as soon as he shall find an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but it will be your wisdom not to stay till he openly declares himself your
Enemy. Consider more his actions, than his words; and for pretences of feigned
friendship, do not forsake your true friends, nor suffer those ordinances you have
made concerning our Kingdoms to be scorned, and made invalid by one that is a
common Enemy to us both.</p>
               <p>After the Deputy had thus spoken, <hi>Pelopidas</hi> again desired the Romans to
be judges of the complaints made by <hi>Nicomedes. And for what remains</hi> (said
he) <hi>you see the present State of Affairs, how</hi> Mithridates <hi>Dominion is
lessened, the entrance of the Sea stopt against him, infinite Spoils carried off
his Lands. But we intreat you a second time Gentlemen, either hinder</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates <hi>from being thus wrong'd, either defend him from oppression, or suffer
him to defend himself without perplexing your affairs. Pelopidas</hi> spoke this
so sternly, that though before they had resolved to support <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> yet
now they would heark to them both as Judges, and because they had
some respect for <hi>Pelopidas</hi> words, and could not reproach <hi>Mithridates</hi>
with any breach of Alliance, they stuck at it a little, but after long Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
they at last Answered in these terms; <hi>We will neither have</hi>
Nicomedes <hi>to offend</hi> Mithridates, <hi>nor suffer any to make War upon</hi> Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,
<hi>for we judge it the interest of the Commonwealth not to suffer him to be
wronged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> After they had pronounced this sentence, <hi>Pelopidas</hi> would have rejoyned,
as not thinking it reasonable; but they made him depart the Assembly.
Wherefore <hi>Mithridates</hi> manifestly wrong'd by the Romans sent his Son
<hi>Ariarathes</hi> with a Powerful Army to seise upon the Kingdom of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi>
who presently drove thence <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> and setled himself in his place.
Whereupon <hi>Pelopidas</hi> going once more to the Commissaries, spoke to them
in this manner.</p>

                           <p>YOU have lately been told, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> with what patience <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>
suffered <hi>Phrygia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia</hi> to be taken from him contrary
to all Reason: You made no account of the injuries done by <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> even in

us rather like Men accused than Accusers, That your Republique would
not have any injury done to <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> as if any one had done it. You then
are the cause, if there hath lately passed any thing in <hi>Cappadocia</hi> to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
of your Republique; for the disdain wherewith you treated us, and your
scornful Answers obliged <hi>Mithridates</hi> to what he has done, and he is now send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Deputies to your Senate to complain of you. Therefore if you please, find
some body to plead your cause; but he conjures you not to attempt any thing
which is not resolved on by the common consent of the Senate and People of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and to think of the importance of this War. Consider that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
he holds by Succession from his Father, is<note n="*" place="margin">2500 miles.</note> twenty thousand Furlongs in
length, and that he hath added to it, many Neighboring Nations, and among
other <hi>Colchis</hi> full of Warlike People, of Greeks that inhabit on the <hi>Euxine</hi>
Sea, and of Barbarians confining on them. That he has Friends ready at his
Service, Scythians, Taures, Basternes, Thracians, Sarmatians, and in short
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65196:73"/>
all the people near <hi>Tanais, Ister,</hi> and the <hi>Palus Maeotis;</hi> that <hi>Tigranes</hi> King of

in conclusion, that he has a mighty power of Shipping, all either fitted or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
ready with all their Gang. Besides, the <hi>Bithynians</hi> told you no lie in what
they said of the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> for it's very likely if the War
once begin, they will declare for us, and not only they, but your Provinces of
<hi>Asia, Greece</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> As for <hi>Italy,</hi> the most part of it not able to suffer
your boundless Avarice is already revolted: and certainly it is matter of amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to all the World, that not being yet able to suppress that War, you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake <hi>Mithridates</hi> by setting on Foot intrigues, sometimes with <hi>Nicomedes,</hi>
sometimes with <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> whilst yet you make profession to be our Friends
and Allies; but it is only in appearance you are so, for in effect you treat us like
Enemies. And if what has past displease you, give better Orders for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
prevent <hi>Nicomedes</hi> from farther offending your Friends; which if you
do, I promise you on the behalf of King <hi>Mithridates,</hi> his Arms and Assistance
against your Allies in <hi>Italy</hi> which have revolted. If not, break off that speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

               <p>After <hi>Pelopidas</hi> had finished this Discourse, the Romans thinking it too
insolent, Replyed, <hi>That they forbad</hi> Mithridates <hi>from attempting any thing
against</hi> Nicomedes, <hi>and ordained him to quit</hi> Cappadocia <hi>in which they would
take care to reestablish</hi> Ariobarzanes. As for <hi>Pelopidas,</hi> they enjoyned him a

what they desired.</p>
               <p>With this Answer he was sent away, but under a good guard, that by
the way he might not corrupt any Person; and forthwith without expecting
from the Senate and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> their advice upon a War of such
Importance, the Romans assembled all the Forces they could draw toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>Bithynia, Cappadocia, Paphlagonia,</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">Galatia.</note>

being in a readiness, and all the Auxiliary Troops drawn to a head, they
divided themselves into three bodies. <hi>Cassius</hi> went and encamped on the
Confines of <hi>Bithynia</hi> and <hi>Galatia; Manius</hi> in the passage by which <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
might enter <hi>Bithynia;</hi> and <hi>Q. Oppius</hi> on the Frontiers of <hi>Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia:</hi>
being all together about forty thousand Men Foot and Horse. They
had likewise a Fleet commanded by <hi>Minucius Rufus</hi> and <hi>C. Populius</hi> to
guard the mouth of the <hi>Pontus.</hi> Besides, <hi>Nicomedes</hi> was likewise in Arms,
to second them with fifty thousand Foot, and six thousand Horse, all in
good order. As for <hi>Mithridates,</hi> his Army alone consisted of two hundred
and fifty thousand Foot, and forty thousand Horse. He had three hundred
Ships of War, and three hundred Gallies, with all Stores, and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
necessary for so great a Fleet and Army. Two brothers called <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>optolemus</hi>
and <hi>Archelaus</hi> had the Command of all these Forces in quality of
his Lieutenant Generals, but the King had his eye upon all, and did many
things himself. As for the Auxiliary Troops, <hi>Archathias</hi> his Son brought
him ten thousand Horse out of <hi>Armenia</hi> the Less. <hi>Dorilaus</hi> Commanded
the Phalanxes, and <hi>Craterus</hi> one hundred and thirty Chariots armed with
Scythes. Such were the preparations on both sides, when at first <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>
and the Romans Armed against each other, which was about the
hundred sixty sixth Olympiad. The first Engagement was near the River
<hi>Amniae,</hi> in a spacious plain, where <hi>Nicomedes,</hi> and <hi>Mithridates</hi> Generals
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65196:74"/>
met. As soon as they discovered one the other, they drew into Battalia.
<hi>Nicomedes</hi> had all his Forces; but <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> and <hi>Archelaus</hi> had only their
light Armed Souldiers, and <hi>Arcathias</hi> Horse, with some Chariots: for the
gross of the Army was a great way distant, wherefore they espying a Rock
in the middle of the plain, sent to possess it, that they might not be inclosed
by the Bithynians, who were much the greater number. Those they
sent being driven back, <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> was more then ever in fear of being
encompassed; wherefore he posted in with all speed possible making
<hi>Arcathias</hi> do the like. <hi>Nicomedes</hi> who knew him came to meet him, and
now began a bloody battel, wherein the Bithynians proved the stronger,
and put their Enemies to the Rout; but as they pressed home upon them,
<hi>Archelaus</hi> wheeling about from the left Wing, came and charged those in
the Rear, who thought they had been Victorious, and as soon as he had
made them face about, gave ground, that <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> might have time to
Rally, as soon as he knew he was again in a Posture, he renewed the
charge, and the Chariots Armed with Scythes being violently driven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Enemies squadrons, caused a strange disorder, some they cut through
the middle of the body, and tore others in quarters, which extreamly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
the Bithynians: for they saw the one half of Men still breathing, the
trunks of bodies and other members hooked fast, and drawn along by the
Chariots, so that the horrour of these spectacles daunting them more then
the fight it self, fear siesed them, and begot a wonderful hurly-burly in
the Ranks. However though <hi>Archelaus</hi> pressed upon them on one side, and
<hi>Neoptolemus</hi> and <hi>Arcathias</hi> were rallied on the other, they took heart, and
facing both ways defended themselves generously for a good space, till such
time as <hi>Nicomedes</hi> after a dreadful slaughter of his Men fled with the rest
to <hi>Paphlagonia.</hi> After this Victory (in which <hi>Mithridates</hi> Phala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

therein good store of Silver, and took a great Number of Prisoners, whom
the King treated kindly, sending them home to their houses, and giving
them Money to bear their charges that he might make his Clemency
known to his Enemies themselves. But if <hi>Mithridates</hi> rejoyced at this first
success, the Roman Generals were no less startled at it. They began to
perceive they had kindled this important War without the Senates Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
with more Rashness then Prudence; They observed how great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of their had been defeated by a handful of Men, who had neither
assistance from any advantage of ground, or any miscarriage in the
Bithynians, but only by the vertue of the Leaders and Valour of the
Soldiers.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> After this, <hi>Nicomedes</hi> retired into <hi>Manius</hi> Camp; and <hi>Mithridates</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
on Mount <hi>Scoroba,</hi> which separates <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Bithynia.</hi> One day
his Scouts which were a hundred <hi>Sarmatian</hi> Horse, met with eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

called <hi>Pachia,</hi> and forced him to fight: he had four thousand Horse, and ten
times as many Foot of whom they killed ten thousand, and took three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
prisoners whom <hi>Mithridates,</hi> caused to be brought before him, and
then dismissed as he had done the others, that he might gain the hearts of
his Enemies. <hi>Manius</hi> lost all his Baggage, and flying along the side of the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65196:74"/>
River <hi>Sangara</hi> passed over it by night, and escaped to <hi>Pergamus. Cassius,
Nicomedes,</hi> and all the Roman Commissaries, seeing themselves every
where thus ill-handled, went and posted themselves at <hi>Leontecephalus</hi> the
strongest place in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> where they began to make new Levies of
Souldiers, they Enrolled the Artificers, Laborers and Plough-men, and
all Men of what sort soever that could be found in <hi>Phrygïa</hi> capable to bear
Arms, whom for a while they began to exercise, but finding them so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handy
and improper for War, that they could never be made serviceable,
they forbore any longer tormenting those poor People, and after having
dismissed them, retired, <hi>Cassius</hi> to <hi>Apamea, Nicomedes</hi> to <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and
<hi>Manius</hi> towards <hi>Rhodes.</hi> Those who had the Guard of the mouth of
<hi>Pontus,</hi> hearing this News, not only quitted their Station, but likewise
<hi>Nicomedes</hi> his Ships as a prey to <hi>Mithridates.</hi> Thus the King of <hi>Pontus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by one only blow become Master of all <hi>Bithynia</hi> went through all the
Cities setling necessary Orders; from thence he passed into <hi>Phrygia,</hi> where
lodging his Army in the same place where <hi>Alexander</hi> had lodged; he took
it for a happy presage, to have spent one night in the place where that
Great Conqueror had once encamped. Proceeding forward he overrun
the rest of <hi>Phrygia, Mysia,</hi> and all the Provinces which the Romans had
newly Conquered in <hi>Asia,</hi> and sending abroad his Captains several ways
he subdued <hi>Lycia, Pamphilia,</hi> and all that stood in his way as far as <hi>Ionia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
There was only <hi>Laodicea</hi> near the River <hi>Licus</hi> that opposed him, because
that <hi>Q. Oppius</hi> was retired thither with his Horse, and the Mercenary
Soldiers. But when a Herald sent from the King told the inhabitants that
the King promised Indempnity to all those of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> provided they
would deliver <hi>Oppius</hi> into his hands, they sent away the Mercenary Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and carried <hi>Oppius</hi> to <hi>Mithridates</hi> with Lictors marching before him
in derision. The King did him no injury, but causing him to be unbound,
carried him every where along with him, well pleased to see a Roman Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
his Prisoner. Sometime after <hi>Manius Aquilius,</hi> Chief of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and Principal Author of the War, was taken, but he was not treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so kindly, they carried him about mounted on an Ass, from City to
City, and forced him to proclaim aloud as he went that he was <hi>Manius,</hi>
and at last at <hi>Pergamus,</hi> poured melted Gold into his mouth to reproach
the Romans of Corruption and Covetousness. <hi>Mithridates</hi> having placed
Governors in all places, as he went, passed along to <hi>Magnesia, Ephesus</hi> and
<hi>Mitylene,</hi> where he was received with so great applause, that the Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
threw down the Roman Statues that were in their City, for which they
were not long after chastized. Then returning into <hi>Ionia</hi> he took <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonicea,</hi>
where he made the inhabitants pay a great Sum of Money, and
placed a Garrison. Here he fell in love with a very beauteous Virgin whom
he took into the Number of his Wives, if any desire to know her name, she
was called <hi>Monima</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Philopoemen,</hi> he likewise by his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants
made War against the Magnesians, Paphlagonians and Lycians
who would not yet wholly submit.</p>
               <p>Whilst <hi>Mithridates</hi> was doing these things, the Senate and People of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> having intelligence of the first Irruption into <hi>Asia,</hi> decreed that an
Army should be sent against him, though they were embroiled with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine seditions, and had then a War with their Allies, which lay heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them by reason that almost all the People of <hi>Italy</hi> revolted against them
one after another. The Consuls drawing the Provinces by lot; <hi>Asia</hi> fell to
<hi>Cornelius Sylla,</hi> together with the Commission of the War against <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:65196:75"/>
and because there was no Mony in the Treasury, it was Decreed by
the Senate that all which <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> had consecrated to the Gods to
make Publick Sacrifices, should be sold. So much was the publick ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
considered in this necessity. However they sold but a part, from
which they raised nine thousand pound weight of Gold, which sufficed
for the expence of this War, for as great as it was they made use of no
more. <hi>Sylla</hi> was detained a long time by the seditious, as we have related
in the History of the Civil War. Mean while <hi>Mithridates</hi> slept not. He
made ready a great Number of Ships to send against those of <hi>Rhodes.</hi> He
wrote private Letters to all the Governours of his Provinces, and the
Magistrates of all his Cities, by which he ordained that on the thirtieth day
from the date the whole multitude should fall upon all the Italians they
could find, with their Wives, Children and Houshold-servants that were
Italians, and after having cut their throats, throw them out upon the
Dunghils without Burial, Confiscating their goods, one half for the King,
and the other for those that slew them. He likewise commanded at the
same time to publish by sound of Trumpet, strict prohibitions to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
under the penalty of a great fine, either to bury the dead or conceal the
living, with a recompence to such as should discover any that were hid, that
the slave who slew his Master should be free, and the Debtor that slew his
Creditor released of one half of his Debt. This Private Order being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatched
to all parts, and the day appointed come, all <hi>Asia</hi> was filled with
infinite Examples of horrible Cruelty, some of which we will relate, The
Ephesians after having pulled by force from the Statues on which they
hung those that had fled for Sanctuary into the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> slew them
upon the very Altars. Those of <hi>Pergamus</hi> when they could not make those
wretches, fled into the Temple of <hi>Esculapius,</hi> quit the place, shot them
with Arrows as they hung upon the Statues. The Adrumetans pursued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea, those who thought to save themselves by Swimming, and sent
those miserable people with their Children to the Bottom. The Caunians,
whom the Romans after having vanquished <hi>Antiochus</hi> had put under the
Dominion of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and whom the Senate soon after had released and
made free, pluckt from the Altars those Italians which had fled for refuge
into the Sacred Palace of their City, first cut the Childrens throats before
their Mothers Faces, then Massacred the Mothers in the sight of their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
and threw the Mens dead bodies upon those of their Wives and
Children. Those of <hi>Tralles</hi> that they might not defile themselves with the
blood of their Guests, employed a certain cruel fellow a Paphlagonian called
<hi>Theophilus,</hi> whom they hired to that purpose, who having shut up the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
in the Temple of <hi>Concord,</hi> made so cruel, and horrible a Butchery,
that he cut of the hands of those that hung upon the Images. In short, all
the Romans and Italians that could be found in <hi>Asia,</hi> Men, Women and
Children, even to the very Freedmen and Slaves were all involved in this
General Massacre; which was sufficient evidence that the People of <hi>Asia</hi>
were transported to these Cruelties, not out of fear of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> but
out of hate to the Romans; But however, they were doubly chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
first by <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who treated them with all sorts of indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and afterwards by <hi>Cornelius Sylla,</hi> who put them to exemplary
punishment.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> After this the King went into the Isle of <hi>Coos,</hi> where being willingly
received he found there the Son of that <hi>Alexander,</hi> who had reigned in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> him he took and caused to be Royally brought up, sending to the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65196:75"/>
Kingdom of <hi>Pontus,</hi> vast Riches taken out of the Treasures of <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s
precious moveables, Jewels and magnificent Habits, together with great
store of Silver Money. Mean while the Rhodians repaired their Walls
and Gates, fortifying them with Engines, by the Assistance of some Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missians,
Lycians, and all the Italians, who escaping out of <hi>Asia,</hi> had fled for
refuge to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> among whom was <hi>L. Cassius</hi> Proconsul of <hi>Asia. Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>
being come to besiege them, they destroyed their Suburbs for fear
the Enemy should possess them, they likewise drew up their Ships in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Battel, one part to Fight in Front, and the other to defend the
Flanks. Whereupon <hi>Mithridates</hi> Rowing round his Fleet in a Galley of
five Banks gave Orders to his Fleet to extend themselves as much as they
could in form of a Crescent, that so by force of Oars they might encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
in their Enemies Ships, who were much fewer in Number. The
Rhodians who were fearful of it, began by little and little to give way, and
at length turning their Prows fled and got into their Port, whose Booms
having shut, so that the King could not enter, he was forced to retreat
because of the Shot made at him from the Walls. He came to an Anchor
hard by, and after having several times in vain attempted the Port, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to stay till his Army came out of <hi>Asia.</hi> Mean while they were perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
skirmishing, in which the Rhodians always had the better, which
much heightned their Courage. On a time as all their Ships were in a
readiness, and they wanted but an opportunity to go and charge the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
a loaden Ship of the Kings passing by the Port was Boarded by a Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Gally of two Banks, which being on each side assisted by those of
their party who Rowed in, in great Numbers, there happened a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Engagement, <hi>Mithridates</hi> transported with anger, and pestered with
too great a Number of Ships, could not give Orders Necessary. But the
Rhodians more experienced in Sea affairs, made nimble turns about the
Kings Ships, whom charging on the broad-side, they bilg'd many of
them, and took and brought into the Port a Galley of three banks
(boarded on the quarter by one of theirs) with all the Gang, and great
quantity of Arms and Plunder. However they mist one of their Gallies of
five Banks, and not knowing any thing of it's being taken by the Enemies,
they sent their Admiral <hi>Demagoras</hi> with six of their nimblest Vessels out to
Sea in search of it. <hi>Mithridates</hi> sent five and twenty after him, <hi>Demagoras</hi>
got into the open Sea without their being able to reach him, but when
night drew on, seeing the Kings Galley's were about to make their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
he fell on and sinking two pursued two others into <hi>Lycia,</hi> and after
having spent that night at Sea, came and joyned the rest of the Fleet.
This was the success to that Sea-fight, as much unhoped for by the Rhodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
by reason of their few Ships, as unlooked for by <hi>Mithridates,</hi> because
of his great Numbers, and indeed it was all but a confusion. In the heat
of the Engagement, an Auxiliary Ship of the Isle of <hi>Chios,</hi> run so full on
Board the Ship the King Commanded, that it broke her to pieces, at
which he was so offended that he put the Pilot and the Mate to death, and
ever after bore a secret Malice to the Inhabitants of that Island. Sometime
after as <hi>Mithridates</hi> Land Army came upon Loaden Ships and Gallies, a
sudden Storm arose which brought all the Fleet towards <hi>Rhodes.</hi> The
Rhodians presently came out with their whole Force, and finding the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Ships, still in disorder, sunk some, burnt others, and brought in four
hundred Prisoners. Wherefore the King prepared once again to Fight
them by Sea, and withal to storm their City: causing to that intent a
<hi>Harpe</hi> to be built, which is a great Engine, raised upon two Ships. And
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65196:76"/>
having understood by the Runaways that it was easie to take the Town
on that side where stood the Temple of <hi>Iupiter Tabyri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</hi> by Scaling the
Wall, which was in that part very low, he caused some of his Soldiers to
Embarque on the Ships, and giving Scaling Ladders to others, ordered
them all to keep silence, till they saw a signal of fire given them from the
place, and that then raising as great a shout as they could, some should
fall in at the Port, others at the Wall. As they were going to put this
design in execution, without making the least noise, the Guards of the
City who had notice of it, shewed a fire, which they taking for the signal
to be given from the place called <hi>Tabyria</hi> broke silence; and both Soldiers
and Mariners began to make the Air ring with Shouts of Joy; but being
answered with the same Notes, by those of the City that stood upon the
Walls, the Royalists attempted nothing all that Night, and in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
were forced to retreat; It is true that the <hi>Harpe</hi> which they drew nigh
unto the Wall opposite to the Temple of <hi>Isis,</hi> extreamly terrified the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
for it cast at the same time mighty quantities of Darts and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
there were likewise upon it Rams which battered the Walls, and
besides multitudes of Soldiers ran out of the Ships with their Scaling Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to mount the Walls, but the Rhodians made a resolute resistance, till
the Engine broke with its own weight, and the Statue of the Goddess <hi>Isis,</hi>
was seen to dart flames of fire against it. Whereupon the King after this
last trial, losing all hopes of taking the Town, raised his Siege. After this
he went and besieged <hi>Patoria,</hi> where as he was about to cut down a Forest
(consecrated to <hi>Latona)</hi> for building of Machines, he was frightned by a
dream from touching those sacred trees. Whereupon leaving <hi>Pelopidas</hi>
in <hi>Lycia,</hi> to continue the War, he sent <hi>Archelaus</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> to draw
what Cities he could to his side either by good will or constraint. And
henceforward easing himself of the Labors and Toils of War, which he
committed to his Generals, he did nothing but leavy Soldiers, and make
provision of Arms, passing away his time with that Woman of <hi>Strato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and in giving judgment upon those who were accused of having
plotted against his life, done any thing against his Service, or favored in
any kind whatsoever the Roman party. Whilst he busied himself in these
matters, affairs in <hi>Greece</hi> passed in this manner. <hi>Archelaus</hi> going with a
Fleet, well appointed took by force the Island of <hi>Delos,</hi> which had revolted
from the Athenians, together with some places which he gave to that
Republick, after the slaughter of twenty thousand Men the most part Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,
and rendring by these Actions the Power of <hi>Mithridates</hi> formidable
in those parts, he gained him the Friendship and Alliance of that People;
he sent to them, likewise the consecrated Treasure at <hi>Delo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y, to whom he gave two thousand Men for a Guard of that
Mony; but he imploy'd them to another purpose, for seeing two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Men at his Command he lived like a Tyrant in his Country, putting
to death many of his Fellow Citizens, and delivering up others to <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
under pretence they were of the Roman Faction. Yet he made
Profession of being a Philosopher of the Sect of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> but he was not
the only Philosopher that has tyrannized in <hi>Athens, Critias</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
who professed the same Philosophy, plaid the Tyrants before
him. The followers of <hi>Pythagaras</hi> did the same in <hi>Italy.</hi> Nor were there
any of those who were called the seven Wise-men of <hi>Greece,</hi> and had any
hand in the Government of the Commonwealth but exercised their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
with more Tyranny then an unlearned Man would have done. So
that it is not without reason that some have doubted whether the other
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65196:76"/>
Philosophers followed the Study of Wisdom so much, out of the pure Love
of Virtue, as to be a comfort to their Poverty, and an excuse for their Sloath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Since even to this Day we see many leading a close and necessitous Life,
who cloak their Poverty under a pretence of Wisdom, furious by railing at
all rich men and Magistrates, which they do not so much out of contempt
of Riches, as out of envy to those which possess them, wherefore I think
those much wiser then, who know how to slight and contemn their Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives.
Thus much by the way against <hi>Aristion,</hi> who gave occasion to this
short digression. To proceed, <hi>Archelaus</hi> drew to his Party the Acheans, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians,
and Beotians, all but the City of <hi>Thespia,</hi> to which he laid Siege.
At the same time as <hi>Metrophanes</hi> whom <hi>Mithridates</hi> had likewise sent into
<hi>Greece</hi> with another Army, made havock in the Isle of <hi>Eubea, Demetriada</hi> and
<hi>Magnesia,</hi> who had refused to declare for the King, <hi>Brittius</hi> came out of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi>
and falling upon his Fleet, with a very small force beat them, sunk a
great Ship and a Foist, and slew all the Mariners, and this in the very face of
<hi>Metrophanes,</hi> which put him in such a fear that he fled. <hi>Brittius</hi> when he
could not overtake him, went and besieged <hi>Sciatha</hi> a nest of barbarous Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
and having taken it hanged the Slave, and cut of the Masters hands,
from thence he went to <hi>Boeotia,</hi> whither a recruit of a Thousand men, as
well Horse as Foot being come to him out of <hi>Macedon,</hi> he gave Battel to
<hi>Aristion</hi> and <hi>Archelaus,</hi> which lasted three days without knowing which
had the better, till such time as the Lacedemonians and Acheans having sent
relief to the Enemy finding himself then two weak he went and encamped

he advanced into <hi>Attica</hi> against <hi>Archelaus.</hi> He took his march

of <hi>Pyraeum</hi> where <hi>Archelaus</hi> had engarrisoned himself, confident in the
strength of the place, the Walls of which were near forty Cubits high and
all of hewn stone. It was indeed a mighty work which had been raised by
<hi>Pericles</hi> in the time of the War of <hi>Peloponnesus;</hi> who when all the hopes
of Victory consisted only in this Port, had fortifyed all he could. Yet the
height of the Walls amused not <hi>Sylla,</hi> who presently clapt to his scaling
Ladders; but the Cappadocians bravely defending themselves, after
giving and receiving many Wounds he gave over and retreated to <hi>Eleusina</hi>
and <hi>Megara,</hi> where he fell to building Engines, resolved to take the <hi>Pyraeum</hi> by
raising Platforms or Terrases higher then the Walls. <hi>Thebes</hi> furnished him
with Workmen and Materials, as Iron Instruments for Battery and such
like things, he cut down Timber in the Academy to frame his great Engines,
and beat down all those long Walls which joyned the Port with the City,
that their Ruins might serve to raise his Platforms. There were in <hi>Pyraeum</hi>
two Athenian Slaves, who whether they were affectionate to the Romans or
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65196:77"/>
to provide for their own security, in case they succeeded, writ on Bullets of
Lead what passed within, and threw then with Slings into the Roman Camp.
<hi>Sylla</hi> observing that they continually slung them, and examining the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
more narrowly, found writ one of the Bullets. <hi>Tomorrow the foot will
sally out on the Labourers in Front, while the Horse charge the Roman Army in
Flank.</hi> Whereupon he laid an Ambush for them and when they thought to
surprize the Romans they were themselves surprized by the Romans, who
after a great Slaughter drove the rest into the very Sea. <hi>Archelaus</hi> seeing
the Platforms advanced in height, caused towers to be erected directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to them, from whence with Darts he sorely vexed the Workmen, and
having caused Forces to come from <hi>Chalcis</hi> and other Isles, he arrived not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Marriners but the Galley-Slaves, seeing himself in such an extremity
of danger. Thus he who before much exceeded the Besiegers in Numbers,
seeing his Forces encreased by these new Recruits, made the Night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about the second Watch a vigorous Sally, wherein carrying lighted
Torches he burnt one of the Testudo's with all its Engines. The Consul
soon repaired the loss, and in ten day's rebuilt and planted others in their
stead, against which <hi>Archelaus</hi> opposed a Tower he erected on the Wall.
After this <hi>Dromichetes</hi> whom <hi>Mithridates</hi> had sent with new Recruits
being arrived, <hi>Archelaus</hi> drew out the Kings Army in Battel, intermixing
the Slingers and Archers and drawing them all up so close under the Wall,
that those who had Guard might from thence annoy the Enemies at distance
with their Bows and Slings, whilst a Party he had placed near the Gates sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed
out upon a signal given, with Torches in their hands, to set fire on the
Machins. The Fight was fierce and continued a long time doubtful, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
one giving Ground, and sometimes the other, the Barbarians were
the first that turned their Backs, but <hi>Archelaus</hi> soon forced them to stay and
return to the Charge, which so startled the Romans that they themselves
fled, till <hi>Murena</hi> coming to the head of them forced them to turn again up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Enemy. At length some Companies of Souldiers returning from
the Wood (to whom those who had been branded with Infamy for their
flight joyned themselves) and arriving in the heat of the Fight, they char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
so furiously upon <hi>Mithridates</hi> Battel, that after having slain two thousand,
they forced the rest to save themselves in the Port, in spite of all the resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of <hi>Archelaus,</hi> who did all he could to stop them, and was so obstinate
in it, that the Gates being shut before he could get in, they were forced to
draw him up the Walls with Ropes. Thus <hi>Sylla</hi> had the honour of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Field, who discharged of the Infamy those had been noted for it,
because of their good service upon this occasion, and honoured the other
with military Recompences. And because Winter was coming on, he went
and encamped near <hi>Eleusina,</hi> and that he might not be annoyed by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions
of the Enemys Horse, he caused a deep Trench to be dug from the
Mountains to the Sea. Whilst they wrought at it, there happened daily
Skirmishes, some or other continually either going from the Trench or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from the Wall, and throwing Darts or shooting Arrows, Stones or
Bullets of Led. This Work finished, <hi>Sylla</hi> who stood in need of Shipping,
sent to Rhodes to furnish himself, but the Rhodians who could not pass the
Seas, which were covered with <hi>Mithridates</hi> his Fleets, advised <hi>Lucullus</hi> a
man very considerable among the Romans and one of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Lieutenants,
to embarque privately for <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to demand of the Kings
and the Maritime Cities Ships to joyn with the Rhodian Fleet. He took
their advice, and fearless of any thing embarqued himself on a pittiful passage
Boat, and often changing Boats that he might not be known, came to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria.</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:65196:77"/>
About this time the two Slaves cast from the Walls Bullets of Lead
on which they had written, that the next Night <hi>Arc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elaus</hi> sent to <hi>Athens</hi>
(where the people were very much oppressed with Famine) some Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
laden with Corn, upon which advice <hi>Sylla</hi> laying an Ambush for them,
took both the men and the Corn. The same day <hi>Munatius</hi> engaging with
<hi>Neoptolemus</hi> the other of <hi>Mithridates</hi> his Generals, wounded him, killed him
fifteen hundred of his men and took a far greater number Prisoners: Some
time after, whilst the Guards of the Port yet slept, some Romans cast Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
from their Engines upon the Walls, and being got up slew the first
they met with, which so surprised the Barbarians, that some believing all was
taken by the Enemy, leaped from the Top of the Walls, but others more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
put themselves upon their defence, slew the Captain of those were
got up, and threw the rest headlong down. And some of them were so
bold as to sally out of the Gate with Torches in their hands, with intent to
set fire to one of the Romans Towers; And they had done it, had they not
been prevented by <hi>Sylla</hi> who after a Fight which lasted all Night and next
Day, forced them to retreat within their Walls. After this, <hi>Archelaus</hi> caused
to be raised on the Wall a great Tower opposite to the greatest of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
where they fought without intermission with shot from their Arba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
or Cross-bow's, till such time as <hi>Sylla</hi> discharging from his greatest Cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow's
twenty large leaden Blluets at a time against the Enemies, slew a great
Number of them, and shook the Tower in such manner, that it cleaving al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
asunder, they were forced to draw it under their Walls, that they
might not have the discouragement to see it tumble down in pieces. Mean
while Famine from day to day increasing in <hi>Athens, Archelaus</hi> was design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to send them Provisions by night, of which the leaden Bullets soon
gave notice. But that General doubting that some one advertised the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
of his designs gave order that at the time when the Corn was to be sent,
there should be a Party ready at the Gates to Sally out with Torches in their
hands upon the Romans at the same instant that <hi>Sylla</hi> assaulted those which
carried it, and indeed it happened that <hi>Sylla</hi> took the Souldiers that carried
the Corn, and <hi>Archelaus</hi> burnt some Engines. Whilst these things passed
<hi>Arcathias</hi> the Son of <hi>Mithridates</hi> being entred <hi>Macedon</hi> with another Army
defeated some Roman Forces, left for the Guard of that Province, became
Master of all <hi>Macedon,</hi> dividing it into Satrapies, and being on his March
towards <hi>Sylla,</hi> to cause him raise his Siege, dyed of Sickness near <hi>Tidea.</hi>
The news of his death being come to the Consuls he caused Forts to be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
quite round the City of <hi>Athens,</hi> which was heavily oppressed with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
to the end that no person being able to get out, the Famine should
encrease so much the more among so vast a Multitude. That done, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to batter the Walls of <hi>Pyraeum</hi> with his Engines, raised on the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms,
but <hi>Archelaus</hi> had with long labour privately undermined them, so
that they beginning to sink; the Romans discovering the Mine, readily drew
off their Engines, and filled up the Hollows with Earth and other Rubbish.
Then in imitation of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> they began to undermine the Wall, till
their Mines coming to meet, there happened a Skirmish between the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
underground, such a one as could be maintained in the Dark. All this
while they battered the Wall more then ever with their Rams planted on
the Terrasses, till such time as one part being beaten down, <hi>Sylla</hi> caused fire
to be cast into a Tower hard by, with intent to burn it, at the same time
commanding all the brave men he had to storm the place, both Parties
fought valiantly, but the Tower was at last burnt, and the Romans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Masters of one part of the Wall upon which they lodged themselves.

Almost at the same instant, another part of the Wall undermined by the
Romans, the Foundations of which they had underpropped as they went,
after that the stanchions which they had set on fire with store of Pitch,
Flax, and Brimstone, were burnt, began to tumble with all those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
it, making the Crash the more terrible, because so unexpected. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that those who had the Guard of the Walls were utterly daunted,
every one trembling for himself, as if he were presently to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rushed in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by a like ruine, wherefore those who where planted in any suspected
places, ran fearfully down in Crouds, taking more care to preserve
their own lives, then repulse the Enemy. <hi>Sylla</hi> the more fiercely pursued
the assault, relieving his wearied Souldiers with fresh men, continually
encouraging them and mingling Threats with Prayes, assuring them that
upon this Brunt which could not last long, depended the whole Victory.
<hi>Archelaus</hi> showed no less courage: He opposed <hi>Sylla</hi> with fresh men in the
place of those whose fears had made them useless, renewed the heat of the
fight, pressing forward and heartning all his people; by telling them they
had but this shock to sustain, and after it there was nothing to be feared.
Thus both Partyes returned to the Charge with wonderful Alacrity, they
fought and slew on both sides, with equal loss. Yet at last <hi>Sylla</hi> taking
Compassion of his Soldiers, so tyred that they were able to do no more, and
admiring their bravery caused the retreat to be sounded. The night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<hi>Archelaus</hi> set to work to repair the two ruined places, making re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments
within in form of a half Moon. <hi>Sylla</hi> thinking these fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
yet moist would easily be beaten down, went presently to assault
them with all his Forces, but he was soon forced to give it over, for being
look'd up in that half Circle very close together, his men could not fight, but
were both in Front and Flank exposed to the Enemys shot, which indeed
annoyed them on all sides.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> Therefore he resolved no more to attempt <hi>Pyraeum</hi> by storm, hoping at
last to reduce the besieged by Famine. But first understanding that the City
was at the last gasp, that they had eaten all their Horses, and after having boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the very Hides for sustenance, had been forced at last feed on dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases,
he caused a Trench to be drawn round about it, to the end that none
might previly escape. And having f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nished that work, he raised his Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
and planted his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>calnig Ladders, upon which the Souldiers mounted
with such a furious violence that those weak and feeble people betaking
themselves presently to flight he became master of the Walls. The whole
City was presently filled with Slaughter, for there was none had strength
enough to escape, and no quarter was given, nor either Sex or Age spared.
For <hi>Sylla</hi> incensed that so readily and without any cause they had taken part
with the Barbarians, and so obstinately defended themselves against him,
had given Orders to put all to the Sword, which made many who had heard
his voice, that proclaimed this Ordinance, come and offer themselves vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
to death. As many as could, made their retreat into the Castle,
among whom was <hi>Aristion,</hi> having first of all set on fire the Theatre for
Musick, for fear least <hi>Sylla</hi> should make use of the Wood, in the assault of
the Fortress. The Consul having taken the City, would not let it be set on
fire, but he gave the Plunder to the Souldiers, who ransaking every where,
found in many Houses Humane Flesh ready drest to eat. On the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
he sold all the Slaves at outcry, and declared that he left at liberty all
the free people, who had escaped the nights slaughter, of whom but few
were found, yet those he deprived of any<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65196:80"/>
Enemies, but promised to restore it to their posterity. This done
<hi>Sylla</hi> besieged the Fortress, wherein <hi>Aristion</hi> and those fled for Refuge
with him, were so sore oppressed with hunger and thirst that they were
constrained to surrender, of whom he put to death <hi>Aristion</hi> with his
Guards, and all that had born Commission under him during his Tyranny,
or in any manner whatsoever had acted contrary to the Ordinances left
them by the Romans since they first became Masters of <hi>Greece;</hi> He par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
all the rest, and left them under almost the same Laws they had
received from the Romans, and in conclusion carried out of the Citadel
forty pound weight of Gold, and six hundred of Silver. The City thus
taken, <hi>Sylla</hi> believed that holding only the Port of <hi>Pyraeum</hi> invested, it
would be a long time before he should starve the Barbarians. Wherefore
he again applied himself to his Batteries and Engines, and caused to be
made Galleries and Mantelets, to go under Covert up to the Walls, and
undermine them. But <hi>Archelaus</hi> had made provision against him, for he
had raised many Walls, one behind another, all after the same manner,
so that <hi>Sylla</hi> saw no end of his labor, having no sooner taken in one Wall,
but he found another of the same Fabrick, yet he indefatigably attempted
all the Walls he met with, causing his Soldiers to relieve each other by
turns, and going sometimes to one party, and sometimes to another en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
them to labor, and assuring them of the great recompences pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for them, when they had overcome these difficulties. And indeed
the Soldiers promised themselves an end of their labors, after this Victory,
and hoped to gain so much the more praise, the more they incountred with
danger and difficulty, wherefore they did all they could to gain these last
Walls, till such time as <hi>Archelaus</hi> astonished at their obstinacy deserting
them, retired into the strongest part of the <hi>Pyraeum,</hi> which being on all
sides begirt with the Sea, the Consul who had no Ships could attempt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
against him. From thence he took his march by <hi>Boeotia</hi> to go into
<hi>Thessaly,</hi> and being got to <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> he rallyed the remains as well of
those Troops which himself had brought into <hi>Greece,</hi> as of those which
came under the Conduct of <hi>Dromicheses,</hi> He sent likewise for all that Army
which had followed <hi>Arcathias</hi> the Kings Son into <hi>Macedon,</hi> which were
all fresh Men that wanted nothing, and besides all these <hi>Mithridates</hi> had
sent him some new Recruits, for he was continually sending. <hi>Sylla</hi> in
the mean time burnt the <hi>Pyraeum</hi> which had given him so much
more trouble then the City, sparing neither Arsenal nor Dock, nor in short
any thing that was considerable.</p>
               <p>This done he took the Field to follow <hi>Archelaus,</hi> taking as well as he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/>
the Road of <hi>Boeotia.</hi> As he was upon his March, those Troops lately assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at <hi>Thermopylae</hi> came forward to meet him as far as <hi>Phocida;</hi> Thraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Pontique Scythians, Cappadocians, Bithynians, Galatians, Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians
and others came from the Provinces, newly Conquered by <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates,</hi>
amounting in all to sixscore thousand Men, under several Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
over whom <hi>Archelaus</hi> was Generalissimo. <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Forces were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of Romans and Italian Allies, together with such Greeks and Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians
as had come over from <hi>Archelaus</hi> to him: And possibly some
Auxiliary Troops of the Neighboring Countries, but all these amounted
not to a third of his Enemies; when they were encamped close by each
other; <hi>Archelaus</hi> every day drew out his Army to invite <hi>Sylla</hi> to a battel,
but he considering the Nature of the place, and the great Number of his
Enemies, thought it best to temporize; At length they retreated towards
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65196:81"/>
                  <hi>Chalcis,</hi> whither he followed them waiting for a favorable opportunity,
and a convenient place. And at last perceiving that near to <hi>Cheronea,</hi>
they were encamped in a place environed with Cragged Rocks, which
were very difficult to pass, he posted himself hard by in a spacious plain,
and drawing up his Army resolved to force <hi>Archelaus</hi> to a Battel, whether
he would or no: He found the place was advantagious for him, either to
charge or retreat in, whereas <hi>Archelaus</hi> was shut up among the Rocks,
which would not permit him to fight with all his Forces together, nor
could he well form his Bodies or draw in Battel among those uneven Crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Stones, where if any misfortune happened, those Rocks themselves
would hinder his Escape. In short having according to his desire met
him in a place where Numbers would be useless, he advanced to engage
him; He who thought of nothing less then Fighting had fortified his Camp
with Negligence enough, nor had he taken notice of the disadvantage of
the place till the Romans furiously advanced to the Charge. He then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a party of his Horse to make head against them, but they being
defeated and driven into the Precipices, he sent next sixty Chariots to
endeavor to break the Ranks of the Legions, who opening to the Right
and Left, gave them way quite through, till they had past the Rearguard,
where before they could turn, the Horses and Drives were all slain by the
Darts thrown at them from all sides. <hi>Archelaus</hi> defended as he was by the
Rocks, might have staid in his Post, but receiving Intelligence that <hi>Sylla</hi>
was at hand, he chose rather with all speed possible to draw up those vast
Multitudes into Battel in those straits: and then pressing forward with the
Horse of his Vanguard he broke quite through the Battel of the Romans,
dividing it into two, and then easily surrounding each part because of their
small Number, these two half-bodies seeing themselves inclosed cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into an Orb and bravely defended themselves, but that where <hi>Galba</hi>
and <hi>Hortensius</hi> commanded was sorely put to it, because <hi>Archelaus</hi> himself
being at the head of his Men pressed on them extreamly, and all the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians
Fighting in his presence strove to show their General some signal
Marks of their Valor. At last <hi>Sylla</hi> coming with a Gross of Horse, <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>
who guessed by the Cornets, and by the dust arising from the Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feet,
that it was he, gave over this manner of Fighting to regain his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Battel, but the Roman Charging home (with all the Flower of his
Cavalry and two Regiments of Foot, which he had laid in Ambush)
amongst the thickest of the Enemies, yet astonished, and not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
any Order, over-pressed them, broke them, put them to the Rout,
and gave them Chase. The Victory thus begun on this part, <hi>Murena</hi> did
wonders to advance it on the Left, for after having pricked forward those
about him by reproaches, he violently led them on upon the Enemy, and
put them likewise to the Rout, Thus <hi>Archelaus</hi> two Wings being defeated
his Main Body stood not long, but all equally took their Flight, nor was
<hi>Sylla</hi> deceived in the Judgment made of the Success of this Enterprize, for
the Enemies intangled in those streits, could not fly, or if they did, threw
one another down the Precipices, and if they turned head fell into the
hands of the Romans, wherefore the wisest of them returned to their
Camp, but <hi>Archelaus</hi> who could not believe the discomfiture so great,
stopt their entrance, and sent them back upon the Enemy, which they
obeyed though they had no Captains to put them in order, nor saw no
Ensigns, which every one in the Rout had thrown here and there, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
they had neither Room to Fight, nor to Retreat. Thus in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
they were slaughtred like Sheep, either by their Enemies, on whom
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65196:81"/>
they could not revenge themselves, being too close crouded, or by their
own Comerades, as it often happens in a too close and disordered Battle,
wherefore they returned in throngs to the Gates of the Camp, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to those had shut them out and reviling them, that adoring the same
Gods, and being tyed by so many bonds one to the other they contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
more to their destruction, then the Enemies themselves. At last <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>
opened the Gates, but too late. They entred in confusion and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and the Romans encouraging one another threw themselves Pell Mell
among the Flyers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where they gave the last push to the Victory. <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi>
and all those that escaped from the Slaughter met together at <hi>Chalcis,</hi>
where of one hundred and twenty thousand Men, they found but ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.
The Romans believed they had lost fifteen Men, but two of them
afterwards returned. Thus ended this battel fought between <hi>Sylla</hi> and
<hi>Archelaus</hi> General under <hi>Mithridates</hi> near to <hi>Cheronea,</hi> the Success whereof
was as well deserving of the Prudence of <hi>Sylla,</hi> as of the foolish rashness of
<hi>Archelaus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> seeing himself Master of a great Number of Prisoners, of great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/>
Booty and vast quantity of Spoils, caused to be heaped together, all that
was useless in one place, and having made due preparation according to
the Custom of the Romans, offered them in Sacrifice to those Divinities
that preside ore War, he himself first kindling the fire. Soon after, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
refreshed his Forces with a little rest, he marched with his Light
Armed Foot towards <hi>Euripus,</hi> hoping, he might there meet with <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus;</hi>
But he had made no stay there, but because the Romans had no
Fleet at Sea, went about overrunning the Islands and plundring the Sea-coasts.
He was likewise so bold as to land upon <hi>Zant,</hi> and to besiege the
City, but some Romans that came against him, having set upon him in
an Ambush by Night, he hastily reembarked his Men, got out to Sea,
and returned to <hi>Chalcis,</hi> doing things all along rather becoming a Pyrate
then a Man of War. <hi>Mithridates</hi> hearing of this great defeat was ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
as indeed he had reason, however he began to make new Levies of
Soldiers in all the Countries under his obedience, and growing jealous,
that after his being thus beaten, there would be some People, that either
at present, or as soon as they had opportunity would make attempt upon
his Person, before he would renew the War he assembled all that he had
the least suspicion of, such were the Tetrarchs of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and all those

All these he put to death with their Wives and Children, some by
surprize, others at a feast by night, only three escaped and fled, for he
thought that if <hi>Sylla</hi> came nearer, none of them would continue faithful
to him. After this he siesed upon their goods, placed Garrisons in their
Cities, and sent <hi>Eumachus</hi> Satrap or Governor into <hi>Galatia,</hi> whom the
Tetrarchs that had escaped, assisted with some Forces of their Vassals
raised in the Country, drove thence with his Garrisons; so that of all the
Goods of that Nation, <hi>Mithridates</hi> enjoyed only the Mony. Having like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
born a secret hate to the Inhabitants of <hi>Chios,</hi> since one of their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies

all their Estates, who were gone into <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Army, then he sent
Commissioners to inform themselves of all those who were of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Faction, and at last <hi>Zenobius</hi> landing there as it were in his passage
for <hi>Greece</hi> siesed by night on the Walls, and most advantagious places of
the City, and after having placed Guards at the Gates he caused Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

to be made that all the Guests and Inmates should take their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and that all the Inhabitants should assemble themselves to know the
Kings Pleasure. That done, he told them that the King was Jealous of
their City, because some of their Inhabitants took part with the Romans,
and that there was no way to remove that suspicion, but by surrendring
up their Arms and delivering such Children, as should be chosen out of
their best Families for Hostages. They see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

without paying any Tribute to us. Your Galley likewise ran on Board mine in

sent the Chief Men of your City to <hi>Sylla,</hi> and have not discovered to
me any of those who without the consent of the whole City were guilty of this
crime, which you ought to have done, had you not all been complices. I might
according to the advice of my Friends punish you with death as Enemies to my

crimes to condemn you in a Fine of two thousand Talents.</p>

               <p>After having heard this Letter read, they desired <hi>Zenobius</hi>'s permission
to send Deputies to the King, which being refused them, disarmed as
they were, and tyed up by those Hostages they had given, and besides
seeing a great Army of Barbarians, ready to cut them in pieces, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to weep, and were forced to sell the Ornaments of their Temples, and
their Wives Jewels to raise the two thousand Talents. When they had
paid it in, <hi>Zenobius</hi> under pretence that it wanted weight, caused them
to Assemble in the Theater, and there encompassing them with Soldiers,
and lining the Streets leading to the Sea-side with Guards, all with drawn
Swords, he caused them to be led out of the Theater, one after another,
and put them on Shipboard, the Men on one side, and the Women and
Children, on the other, whilst the Barbarians, as they past affronted them
with a thousand indignities; thus he took them all out of their Country,
and sent them to <hi>Mithridates</hi> in the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea. Those of <hi>Chios</hi> being
treated in this manner, <hi>Zenobius</hi> came before <hi>Ephesus</hi> with all his Forces,
but the Ephesians made him leave his Arms at the Port, and would not let
him enter the City but with a very small train. He submitted to it, and
went and lodged at <hi>Philopoemens</hi> (Father of <hi>Monima, Mithridates</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
to whom the King had given the Government of that place) and
soon after proclaimed an Assembly off the City, but the Ephesians, who
expected nothing but mischief from him, put off the business till next
morning. Mean while they assembled in the night, and mutually encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging

At the same time they planted good Guards on their Walls, armed the

Those of <hi>Trulles, Hypapa</hi> and <hi>Mesopolis</hi> and others, whom the Calamity
of the Inhabitants of <hi>Chios</hi> had terrifyed, hearing the news, follow the
Example of the <hi>Ephesians:</hi> So that <hi>Mithridates</hi> was forced to send an Army
against these Rebels, severely punishing those who returned not to their
obedience till they were forced. And to hinder others from revolting, he
declared all the <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities free, and all Debtors released from their
Creditors, and gave the Inmates freedom of Burgesses in all places where
they inhabited, and set the Slaves at liberty. Hoping (as it happened)
that the Debtors, Inmates and Slaves engaged by these benefits, would
employ all their force to maintain the Royal Power. Mean while <hi>Mini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Philotirous,</hi> Natives of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and <hi>Clysthenes,</hi> and <hi>Asclepiodorus</hi> of
<hi>Lesbos,</hi> all well known to the King, <hi>Asclepiodorus</hi> himself having some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
commanded his Mercenary Troops, conspired against him, but the
conspiracy being discovered by <hi>Asclepiodorus,</hi> (who to give a manifest
Proof of it ordered matters, so that the King hid behind a bed heard it
from <hi>Minio's</hi> one mouth) the conspirators ended their lives in torments.
Many were afterwards suspected of the same crime, fourscore of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> being thereupon arrested, besides many others in
other Cities, the King sending Spies into all parts, under his obedience,
to find out the Criminals, every one of which making discovery of his
Enemy, there perished about sixteen hundred men; but the Accusers soon
received their Chastisement: for of them, some were punished by <hi>Sylla,</hi>
others slew themselves, and others fled with <hi>Mithridates,</hi> to the Kingdom
of <hi>Pontus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilst these things passed in <hi>Asia,</hi> the King had raised an Army of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/>
fourscore thousand men, which <hi>Dorilaus</hi> carried into <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Archelaus,</hi>
who had still ten thousand men, the remainder of his former Forces.
When <hi>Sylla</hi> who now lay encamped within sight of him, near to <hi>Orchome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi>
beheld so vast a Multitude of Horse arrive, he caused several Ditches to
be dug through the Plain, ten foot wide, and when <hi>Archelaus</hi> advanced
towards him, put his Army in a posture to receive him, but perceiving the
Romans fought but coldly, against such numbers of Horsemen, he rid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
through the Ranks, stirred them up, threatned them, and at length
not being able to provoke them, leaps from his Horse, takes a Colours in
his hands, and advancing with his Guards in the midst between two Battels,
cryes out. <hi>If any asked you fellow Soldiers, where you left your General</hi> Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,
<hi>tell them it was fighting near</hi> Orchomene. Hereupon the Officers mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the danger in which they saw him, advanced from their standing,
and ran to his assistance, the Soldiers urged with shame followed, and all
together made the Enemy give ground who before put them hard to it: <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
perceiving this entrance towards Victory, mounts again on Horse back,
shows himself every where, prayses his Soldiers, encourages them, and at
last remains Master of the Field; After having slain fifteen thousand men,
the most part Horsemen (among whom was <hi>Diogenes,</hi> the Son of <hi>Arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,)</hi>
and driven the Foot into the very Camp of the Barbarians: At the
same instant for fear left <hi>Archelaus</hi> should save himself at <hi>Chalcis,</hi> as he had
done the time before, he disposed Guards throughout the whole Plain, to
keep Watch that night, and in the morning caused to be drawn before the
Camp a Trench not above a Furlong distant from it. <hi>Archelaus</hi> in the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65196:83"/>
mean time kept within his Trenches, but <hi>Sylla</hi> after having exhorted his
Soldiers to make an end of the remain of this War, since the Enemies
durst not appear, undertook to force them, and marched directly to the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault.
Upon this great change, and in this pressing necessity, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
began by Speeches, to encourage their Troops: Each Captain show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Solders the danger they were in, if they did not defend themselves,
representing to them how cowardly a thing it would be, if they should not
have Heart enough, to drive from their Trenches an Enemy, they far sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
in number. Whereupon there presently arose a great noise, on both
sides, each Party was set on fire, and did actions wonderful. At last the
Romans leaped into the Ditch and stormed an Angle of the Camp, out of
which they plucked the Palisado's. The Barbarians who perceived it, lined
the Angle close, with their Swords drawn ready to fight nearer at hand, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
much that no person durst enter, till <hi>Basilius</hi> the first Tribune of a Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
leaped up and overturning him he first encountred with, the whole
Army thereupon followed, and made a mighty slaughter of the Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
Some they slew in the Chase, others they drove into a Lake hard by,
and some who could not swim, cryed out for Quarter, but in vain, for their
Language not being understood, they were cut in pieces, <hi>Archelaus</hi> hid
himself in a certain Marsh, and having there found a little Boat, escaped
to <hi>Chalcis,</hi> where he speedily drew together all the remains of <hi>Mithridates</hi>
Forces. Next Morning <hi>Sylla</hi> gave a Crown to the Tribune, and distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Military Recompences to the others. After which he went and spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Boeotia,</hi> because those people were perpetually changing Parties, and
from thence passed into <hi>Thessaly</hi> where he took up his Winter Quarters,
expecting <hi>Lucullus</hi> with the Shipping, of whom receiving no certain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
he set to building of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> Whilst he was doing all these things, <hi>Cornelius Cinna,</hi> and <hi>Cajus Marius</hi>
his particular Enemies declared him at <hi>Rome</hi> Enemy of the Common-Wealth,
pulled down his Houses, seised his Lands, and put to death his
Friends. Yet ceased not he to do all he could, having a most obedient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
composed all of valiant Soldiers. Now <hi>Cinna</hi> having drawn to his
Party, his Collegue <hi>Flaccus</hi> sent him into <hi>Asia,</hi> with two Legions, to
Command in the Province, and make War on <hi>Mithridates,</hi> in the place of
<hi>Sylla,</hi> who was declared Enemy, and because he was not very expert in
War, <hi>Fimbria</hi> one of the Senate in good esteem with the Soldiers, went
along with him. They embarked at <hi>Brundusium,</hi> to cross the Sea, a good
part of their Ships were lost by Storm, and those who gained the other side
were taken and burnt by the new Army, sent by <hi>Mithridates. Flaccus</hi>
was proud, covetous, cruel in punishing, and therefore hated by the
Soldiers, which made some Troops that were sent before into <hi>Thessaly,</hi> to
go over into <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Camp, and it was only <hi>Fimbria,</hi> (whom they esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the better Captain, and more merciful then <hi>Flaccus)</hi> that prevented the
others from doing the like. There happened by chance some difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Questor and he about encamping, wherein <hi>Flaccus</hi> who was
Judge, not having duly considered the Quality of <hi>Fimbria,</hi> he threatned
him to return to the City. <hi>Flaccus</hi> presently named a successor in his
charge, and forthwith embarked for <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> Whereupon <hi>Fimbria</hi> tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the opportunity of his absence, took away the Rods from <hi>Therinus,</hi>
whom he had made Propretor, saying the Army had given him that Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and <hi>Flaccus</hi> thereat offended, returning to punish him, he put him to
flight, and forced him to hide himself in a private House, from whence
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65196:83"/>
escaping by night over the Walls, he got to <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and from thence to
<hi>Nicomedia</hi> where he caused the Gates to be shut. But <hi>Fimbria</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
there, and drawing him out of a Well where he had hid himself,
slew him though a Roman Consul, and more then that his General, whilst
he was but a private man, who had followed his friend of greater Quality
then he, at his coming into the Province. He cut of his Head, which he
threw into the Sea, leaving the rest of the Body unburied, and having
made himself General of the Army, fought afterwards successfully, in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Engagements with <hi>Mithridates</hi> Son. At length having to deal with
the King himself, he drove him to the very Gates of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> whence he
flying to <hi>Pisane,</hi> had been there besieged had he not taken shipping and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped
to <hi>Mitylene.</hi> After this <hi>Fimbria</hi> going through the Province, ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
those who favoured the Party of the Cappadocians, and spoiled their
Lands, who refused to open their Gates to him. The City of <hi>Ilium</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged,
whose Inhabitants having recourse to <hi>Sylla</hi> he promised to come, and
sent to <hi>Fimbria</hi> not to do any injury to those who had yielded to him, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them for being returned into the friendship and alliance of the Roman
people. Notwithstanding he required to be likewise received into their
City, being likewise of <hi>Rome,</hi> and telling them I know not what of that
ancient Kindred of which the Ilians boast. At last he entred by force,
slew all he met with, set on fire the City, and particularly put to several
sorts of death, those who went to <hi>Sylla,</hi> on the behalf of the City. He
had neither respect to the sacred places nor to those had fled thither for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
but burnt the Temple of <hi>Minerva,</hi> with a great multitude of people,
who had retired thither, as to a Sanctuary. He rased the very Walls, which
he went round about next day, to see if any part were left standing. Thus
was that City worse treated, by a Man who took thence his Original, then
it had formerly been, by <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> for he left not a house, nor a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
nor a Statue standing. Some there are that believe, that the Image of
the Goddess, which is called <hi>Palladium,</hi> was now found whole, after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of the Rubbish, wherewith it was covered, but there is more reason
to believe it was taken away by <hi>Diomedes</hi> and <hi>Ulysses</hi> in the time of the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi>
War. This Massacre of the Ilians, happened about the end of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and third Olympaid, and it is thought to be about one thousand and
fifty Years between this sack of <hi>Troy</hi> and that of <hi>Agamemnon.</hi>

that, since his first sending an Army into</hi> Greece, <hi>he had lost
such vast Multitudes in so short a time, wrote to</hi> Archelaus, <hi>that he should

demanded a conference with</hi> Sylla, <hi>which being granted, he told him;</hi>
Sylla, the King <hi>Mithridates</hi> your Fathers friend, and yours, was forced by
the avarice of those who had the Command before you, to make the War: But
having now experienced your Valour, he demands a Peace, provided what you
shall desire of him, be just. <hi>Whereupon</hi> Sylla, <hi>who had neither Fleet nor

Temples of</hi> Pythia, Olympia <hi>and</hi>

Rebellions, and who besides all this, was impatient, to transport that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
fresh and every way compleat to</hi> Rome <hi>against his Enemies, consented
to his Peace, by telling him; Archelaus, Mithridates</hi> should have sent
Ambassadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> to complain of the injuries he had received, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65196:84"/>
of that he himself injured others, entring in hostile manner into their
Territories, plundring their Treasures as well Publick as Sacred, seising on the
Goods of those he had put to death, and showing no more faith nor goodness to
his own friends then to us, destroying many of them, and murdering the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarchs,
his familiars who had all their throats cut in one night, with their
Wives and Children, though they were not guilty so much as of a design. As
for what regards us, he rather made appear his inveterate hatred, then any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
he had to make War, when he let loose his rage against the Italians in <hi>Asia,</hi>
by a thousand sorts of Torments, sparing neither Age, Sex nor Quality. So much
hate does this man bear to the Latin Name, who calls himself my Fathers
Friend, but never remembred that friendship till I had slain him a hundred and
sixty thousand men. Wherefore we have no reason to trust you any more. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
for your sake I promise he shall obtain favour from the Senate and People
of <hi>Rome,</hi> if it be in good earnest that he ask it, but if he still feign, I advise
you <hi>Archelaus,</hi> to consider the present estate of his affairs and your own, how he
treats his Friends, and how we have dealt with <hi>Eumenes</hi> and <hi>Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissa.
At these words</hi> Archelaus <hi>interrupted him, angry that he should
tempt him, and telling him he was not a man to betray Forces intrusted to
his charge, but that he really hoped for peace if</hi> Sylla <hi>demanded only just
things. Whereupon</hi> Sylla, <hi>after some moments Silence:</hi> Provided <hi>(said he)
Archelaus,</hi> that <hi>Mithridates</hi> put into our hands all the Fleet he has, restore
the Generals Deputies, and other Prisoners, deliver up the Runaway's and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive
Slaves, send back to their Cities those of <hi>Chios,</hi> and others transported
to the Euxine Sea, withdraw his Garrisons from all places where he has planted
them, save only those he had before the Peace was broke, pay the Expence of this
War, which he has been the cause of, and content himself with the Kingdom of
his Ancestors. I hope to prevail so far that the Roman people shall forget the
Offences they have received. <hi>Archelaus hearing these conditions, began
presently to withdraw his Garrisons, and about the rest wrote to the King.</hi>
Sylla, <hi>that he might not in the mean while loose any time; went and spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Countries of the Henetians, Dardanians, and other Neighbouring
Nations, who made delay incursions into</hi> Macedon, <hi>by that means exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his Soldiers.</hi> Mithridates <hi>Deputies returning some time after, agreed
to all, save only about</hi> Paphlagonia, <hi>but added that they could have had
better terms from the other General</hi> Fimbria. <hi>Whereupon</hi> Sylla <hi>offended
at that comparison, made answer,</hi> that that word should cost <hi>Fimbria</hi> dear,
and that as soon as he came into <hi>Asia,</hi> he would see whether <hi>Mithridates</hi> stood
in need of Peace or War. <hi>Whereupon he caused his Army to take their
March through</hi> Thrace, <hi>that he might bring them to</hi> Cypsela, <hi>having sent</hi>
Lucullus <hi>before to</hi> Abydos, <hi>for he was now returned, having often very
narrowly escaped falling into the hands of Pyrates. However he had
brought with him a kind of Fleet of Ships, which he had been furnished
with at</hi> Cyprus, Phoenicia, Rhodes, <hi>and in</hi> Pamphilia, <hi>with which he had
pillaged all the Coast as he came along, and skirmished with</hi> Mithridates
<hi>his Fleet:</hi> Sylla <hi>therefore parting from</hi> Cypsela, <hi>and</hi> Mithridates <hi>from</hi> Perga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
<hi>met together, and began a new conference, being drawn out into the
Field, with few followers in the sight of both Armies.</hi> Mithridates <hi>began
his discourse with the alliance which he and his Father had with the people
of</hi> Rome, <hi>complained of the injuries he had received from the Roman Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
and Commissaries, who had established</hi> Ariobarzanes <hi>in</hi> Cappadocia,
<hi>taken from him</hi> Phrigia, <hi>and favored by their dissimulation the Violences of</hi>
Nicomedes. And all this <hi>(said he)</hi> for Money which they received sometimes
from me, and sometimes from my Enemies, for there is nothing, you Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65196:84"/>
of <hi>Rome</hi> may so justly be reproached with as love of Money. In short,
your Generals being come to make War against me, whatever I have done in my
own defence, ought rather to be attributed to necessity then to any deliberate pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
<hi>Mithridates having only said thus much,</hi> Sylla <hi>answered in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
Though this be not the business, we are met for, but only to conclude a
Peace on the conditions by me already proposed, yet I will likewise in few words
satisfy you in what you reproach us with. When I commanded in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> I
reestablished <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> by the Senates order, and I did it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you yielded to the Authority of the People, for you ought either to have
opposed it and shewed your reasons in Iudgments, or after having suffered it,
acquiesce in the Decree of the Senate. As for <hi>Phrygia, Manius</hi> gave it you,
corrupted by your gifts, which made it a common crime betwixt you, and by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you got it by corruption, you own the possession unlawful, and indeed <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
being convicted of having done many things of like nature for Money, the
Senate declared them all null. Wherefore <hi>Phrygia</hi> being granted to you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly,
they would not make it tributary to <hi>Rome,</hi> but set it at liberty. And
when we dispense with our dominion, over a Country which by right of War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to us, as Conquerours of it, what reason have you to siese on it? As for
<hi>Nicomedes,</hi> he complains that by your perswasion <hi>Alexander</hi> who designed to
kill him, wounded him, and <hi>Socrates Chrestus</hi> invaded his Kingdom. He
confesses that thus injured, he entered armed into your Territories, but if you
thought your self injured without cause you should have sent your Deputies to
<hi>Rome,</hi> and expected the answer of the Senate. Yet granting that in the assault
of <hi>Nicomede,</hi> you only repelled force by force, what had <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> done,
that you should drive him out of his Estates? Therefore the Roman Generals
that were upon the place, were obliged to reestablish him, and by resisting them,
you kindled a War long time premeditated, and to begin which, you sought only
an opportunity, out of the hopes to become Masters of all the World, if you
could overcome the Romans. We have manifest Proofs of this, since before
any War was begun, you entred into alliance with the Thracians, Scythians, and
Sarmatians, solicited the Kings your Neighbours by your Embassadors, caused
Shipping to be built, provided your self with Pilots and men of War; but above
all, the Time you chose for the Execution of your Designs is your conviction,
for as soon as you knew that our Allies in <hi>Italy</hi> were resolved against us, you
made use of that opportunity while we thus were embroyled to assail <hi>Nicomedes,</hi>
and <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> and one after another, <hi>Galatia, Paphlagonia,</hi> and our own
province of <hi>Asia.</hi> What cruelties have you not acted? Whether to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which you have submitted to Slaves and Debtors, the first of which
you freed from Servitude, and the last from the Power of their Creditors:
Whether to the <hi>Greeks</hi> of whom you put to death sixteen hundred for one sole
crime. Whether to the Tetrarchs of <hi>Gallogrecia,</hi> whom you murdered eating
at your table. Or whether to the Italians, whom in the same day you put all to
the Sword, or drowned them in Water with their Wives and Children, without
respect to the sacred places, or the Temples, whither they had fled for Sanctuary.
What Inhumanity did you not manifest in this occasion? What Impiety, what
furious hate against us? In conclusion, after having seised the Treasures of all
these people, you sent over great Armies into <hi>Europe,</hi> contrary to our Edict, by
which it is expresly forbid all Kings of <hi>Asia,</hi> to enter there. That done you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
<hi>Macedonia,</hi> one of our Provinces, deprived the <hi>Greeks</hi> of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and never repented of all this, nor made any use of the Intercession of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelaus</hi>
till after I had recovered <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and delivered the <hi>Greeks</hi> from
your violence by slaying one hundred and sixty thousand of your men, and taking
two of your Camps, with all their Munition. And now I cannot but wonder,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65196:85"/>
that you should excuse your self of the same matters for which you asked par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
by <hi>Archelaus,</hi> unless it be that when I was far off, you were afraid of me, and
now seeing me near, you think I am come to plead; but pleadings are in vain when
Arms are once taken in hand. We do make War upon you, and have defended
our selves bravely hitherto, and will defend our selves to the end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> pronouncing these words in Anger, the King was afraid, accepted
the conditions proposed to <hi>Archelaus,</hi> and after having surrendred up his
Shipping, and executed all that was contained in the Articles of Peace, he
returned into <hi>Pontus,</hi> reduced to the Kingdoms of his Father only. Thus
was the first War against <hi>Mithridates</hi> appeased.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> after this went and encamped within two Furlongs of <hi>Fimbria,</hi> and
sent to summon him to deliver into his hands, the Army which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
contrary to the Laws, to which he in raillery returned answer, that
<hi>Sylla</hi> himself had no very legitimate command. <hi>Sylla</hi> thereupon besieged
him in his Trenches, and many publickly forsaking him, he assembled
the rest to beseech them to stay, but they told him they would not fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Roman Citizens: He thereupon rent his Robe, addresses himself to
every one in particular, begging with Tears in his eyes, but they having
an aversion for such a meanness of Spirit, the greatest part went over into
<hi>Sylla</hi>'s Army. Then he ran from Tent to Tent to solicite the Tribunes, part
of whom having gained by Money, he once again assembles the Soldiers to
renew the Oath. Upon which the <hi>Henetians</hi> crying out all with one voice,
that the Soldiers should be called out and sworn man by man, he gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
first to call out those who had received kindnesses from him, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<hi>Nonius</hi> the Companion of all his Crimes, who refused to swear, he
drew his Sword, and had thrust it into his belly, had not a great shout sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
raised throughout the whole Army, stopt his proceeding farther. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this he suborned a Slave with Money and promises, to go into <hi>Sylla</hi>'s
Camp as a Runaway and to kill him, but he not having been able to bear up
with constancy enough, his trembling made him suspected, so that being
taken, he confessed the whole matter. This attempt inflamed all <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
with just anger, and made <hi>Fimbria</hi> so despisable, that the Soldiers
going to the Ditch of his Camp, reviled him, calling him <hi>Aristion,</hi> after the
name of one of those fugitive Slaves in <hi>Sicily,</hi> who for a few daies was
King. Wherefore <hi>Fimbria</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ost to all hopes, advanced to his Rampart, and
demanded to speak with <hi>Sylla,</hi> who sending <hi>Rutilius</hi> in his stead, put <hi>Fim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria</hi>
quite in despair, seeing a conference would not be granted to him,
which had not usually been denied even to Enemies. Yet he spoke to <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius,</hi>
and told him he desired pardon for the faults he might have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
through the imprudence of his Age. To which <hi>Rutilius</hi> answered,
that if he would depart out of <hi>Asia,</hi> where <hi>Sylla</hi> was Proconsul, he would
give him pass-port as far as the Sea, he replied he knew a way more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
and at the same time returning to <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and entring the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> he thrust himself quite through the body with his
Sword, but the wound not being mortal, he desired the assistance of one
of his Slaves, who dispatched him, and afterward slew himself. Thus
ended <hi>Fimbria,</hi> the second Plague of <hi>Asia,</hi> next to <hi>Mithridates. Sylla</hi> gave
his body to his freed men to bury it, saying he would not imitate <hi>Cinna</hi> and
<hi>Marius,</hi> who had deprived many in the City, not only of life, but Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als;
he received likewise the Army of the defunct, which came to yield
themselves up to him, and joyned them with his own. After this he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Curio</hi> to reconduct <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> into their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65196:85"/>
and wrote to the Senate of all that he had done, without taking
the least notice of his having heard that he was declared Enemy of the
State, then he proceeded to settle Necessary Orders in the Province, he
enfranchized and placed in the Number of the Allies of the people of <hi>Rome</hi>
those of <hi>Ilion, Chios, Lycia, Rhodes, Magnesia,</hi> and some other people in
acknowledgement of the good services they had done the Common-wealth
of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the better to comfort them for the miseries they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
for taking part with the Romans. And after having sent Parties of
Soldiers to all the other Cities, he caused an Ordinance to be proclaimed by
which all Slaves were enjoyned to return under the Power of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
but because that many would not obey, and that many Cities like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
revolted, the publishing of this ordinance caused a multitude of disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and was followed by strange Slaughters, as well of Slaves, as free
people, besides the ruine of several Cities whose Inhabitants were sold at
outcry. He likewise severely chastised all those who had taken part with
the Cappadocian as well in general as particular, especially the Ephesians,
who out of a base complacence for <hi>Mithridates,</hi> had shamefully taken out
of their Temple, the gifts presented by the Romans. After this Heralds
were sent to all the Cities, to give notice to the principal Inhabitans, to
appear upon a certain day before <hi>Sylla</hi> at <hi>Ephesus.</hi> Where being assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
he took his seat on the Tribunal, and spoke to them in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>

and the Rhodians, our Allies, rather as Subjects then as Tributaries, which is

them from their obedience. These benefits we have done, you observe now your
acknowledgment. After that <hi>Attalus Philometor</hi> had left us his Kingdom by

at private persons, that the repose and delights which you enjoyed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
in your Spirits your animosities and aversion against us, and taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
from the differences we had with our Allies, some invited <hi>Mithridates</hi> to
make War against us, and others joyned with him, as soon as they saw him in the
Field. But that which is most heynous, you conceived no horror to murder, by
his order on the same day all the Italians with their Wives and Children, not
sparing those who had fled for refuge into the Temples, consecrated to your
Gods. 'Tis true you have in some measure been chastised by <hi>Mithridates</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who violating the Promises he had made you, gave you over to the Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his Soldiers, and filling your Province with Blood and Slaughter, des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiled
you of your Lands, discharged your Creditors of the Money they ought
you, gave liberty to your Slaves, and set Tyrants in many places over you, and
encouraged the Retreats of Thieves, and Pyrates in all places, both by Sea and

Protectors you had cast off, and those you had chosen; We have likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
some punishment on the Persons of the Authors of these disorders, but
that is not enough; It is but just to impose some publick penalty that may be
agreeable to your crime; But fear not from the Roman Clemency Massacres,
rash confiscations, insurrections of slaves, or other barbarous actions of that
Nature. We allow something to the Graecian Name, to the glory of <hi>Asia,</hi>
and to our Ancient Friendship. I therefore condemn you only in the advance
of five years tribute which you owe, together with the mony expended in this War,
and a certain Sum to be imployed in the affairs of the Province. I my self
will appoint the contribution of each City, and the time of payment; and take

               <p>Having said these words he Assessed the several Sums, sent the Rolls
to the Deputies, and appointed Commissioners for Collecting of the
Moneys. Now they being Poor and already very much in Debt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
sorely oppressed with the quartering of Soldiers, were constrained to
Mortgage to the Usurers, some their Theaters, others their places for
Excercises, others their Forts or Gates or some Publick Building; Thus
great Sums of Mony were brought in to <hi>Sylla,</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> groaned under its
Calamities; for besides all this the Pyrates kept the Sea with such great
Fleets, that they might almost compose so many perfect Armies, with
which they publickly pillaged the Sea Coasts. <hi>Mithridates</hi> sent them
first to spoil those places, the Dominion of which he was like to loose,
but they were extreamly increased and grown formidable, not only to
those that sailed on the Sea, but likewise to the Ports, Castles and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Cities. So that <hi>Iassos, Samos, Clazomene</hi> and <hi>Samothracia</hi> were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and sackt before <hi>Sylla</hi>'s face, and 'tis said they took out of the Temple
of <hi>Samothrace,</hi> Riches to the value of a thousand Talents. He would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, whether he thought them unworthy because of their infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or because he hastned his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> by reason of the seditious,
wherefore he passed into <hi>Greece,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Italy,</hi> with the
greatest part of his Army. We have writ what he did there in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story

                  <hi>Murena</hi> whom <hi>Sylla</hi> had left with <hi>Fimbrias</hi> two Legions to settle the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
orders necessary in the province, sought only some occasion of war,
out of a Passion to obtain the Honor of Triumph, and <hi>Mithridates</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into his Kingdom made War upon the Colches, and the Bospho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans
who had revolted against him. As for the Colches they only demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Mithridates</hi> Son for their King, and having obtained it returned to
their obedience. But the King having a suspicion that what they had
done was by his Sons solicitation, sent for him, fettered him in chains of
Gold, and soon after made him away, though he had served him well in
<hi>Asia</hi> against <hi>Fimbria.</hi> As for those of <hi>Bosphorus, Mithridates</hi> set forth a
Fleet and raised so powerful an Army, that such great preparations gave
occasion to believe they were not made against the Bosphorans but against
the Romans. For the King had not yet so absolutely quitted the possession
of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> to <hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> but that it was with the reserve of some
places. He had moreover entertained a suspicion that <hi>Archelaus,</hi> when he
was in <hi>Greece</hi> had granted to <hi>Sylla</hi> conditions beyond what was reasonable
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65196:86"/>
which that Captain perceiving was afraid, and fled to <hi>Murena</hi> for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.
He animated him so far against <hi>Mithridates</hi> that he presently
took the field to be beforehand with him, and entring his Country by the
way of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> forraged as far as the Gates of <hi>Comanes</hi> the greatest
City of the Kingdom, Celebrated for a famous and rich Temple, where
having defeated some Horse of the Kings, the Deputies on his behalf
came to him, remonstrating that by this Action he broke the Articles of
Peace, to which he answered that he saw no Articles, and indeed, <hi>Sylla</hi>
had drawn no writings, but only contenting himself with the Execution of
the conditions, was departed out of the Province. <hi>Murena</hi> giving only this
short Answer, pursued his Enterprise, and after having pillaged even the
Consecrated Monies, returned to take his Winter quarters in <hi>Cappadocia.</hi>
The King sent Ambassadors to the Senate, and to <hi>Sylla</hi> to make his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of <hi>Murena,</hi> who in the mean time forbore not crossing the River
<hi>Halis</hi> (though very broad, and at that time extreamly swoln by reason of the
Rains) and sacking four hundred Villages of <hi>Mithridates</hi> Kingdom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
receiving any opposition from the King, who expected the return of
his Ambassadors. So that the Roman General returned into <hi>Phrygia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and
<hi>Galatia</hi> with a great booty, where <hi>Callidius</hi> sent from <hi>Rome</hi> because of
<hi>Mithridates</hi> complaints, came to meet him. He showed him no Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the Senate, but only told him before a great company there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
that the Senate forbad him to do any injury to a King, with whom
they had contracted a Peace, and after having said those words in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
he entertained him a good while in private. <hi>Murena</hi> forbore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of his former Violence, but on the contrary presently caused his
Army to March towards the Frontiers of <hi>Mithridates</hi> Kingdom, who seeing
now it must of force come to an open War, commanded <hi>Gordius</hi> to possess
himself of the Neighboring Villages. That General forthwith made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
of beasts for burthen and munitions, and gathering together all the
Country, and as many Soldiers as he could, went and encamped on the
River, directly opposite to <hi>Murena,</hi> but neither one nor the other put
themselves in a posture to fight, till such time as the King being come with
a more powerful Army, there hapned a great Engagement: For the King
having passed the River, notwithstanding all the Resistance of the Enemy
forced <hi>Murena</hi> to give ground, and to secure himself on an eminence na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
fortified, from whence taking the byways of the Mountains, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<hi>Phrygia,</hi> after having lost many of his people, either in the flight
or in the Battel. The Fame of this great Victory, gained so suddenly, and
as it were in passing, being soon spread abroad in all places drew Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of people to <hi>Mithridates.</hi> And he to return his thanks to <hi>Iupiter
Militaris,</hi> after having driven out all the Garrisons <hi>Murena</hi> had left in
<hi>Cappadocia,</hi> sacrificed to him according to the custom of the Country. The
place where this Sacrifice is made is on a high mountain, on the top of
which they raise a mighty pile for the Victims, to which the Kings bring
the first Wood, then they raise another smaller Pile on the top of that,
whereon they pour Milk, Hony, Oyl and Wine, and all sorts of Odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous
Drugs. At the foot of the Pile is a Feast made for the Assistants,
like to those the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> were accustomed to make at <hi>Pasargada,</hi>
and after all they set fire to the Pile, the flame of which rises so high that it
is ordinarily seen a<note n="*" place="margin">An hundred twenty and five Miles.</note> thousand Furlongs, and the fire so heats the Air
thereabout, that the place is not to be approached for some days after.
Thus Sacrificed <hi>Mithridates.</hi> But <hi>Sylla</hi> judging that it was a blemish to
his Honor to have the War still continued against a King, with whom he
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65196:87"/>
himself had concluded a peace, prevailed to have <hi>Gabinius</hi> sent to <hi>Murena,</hi>
to order him positively to give over this War, and to reconcile <hi>Mithridates</hi>
with <hi>Ariobarzanes.</hi> They met therefore together in a place where <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>
delivered to <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> in Hostage one of his Sons of four years
old, to the end, that part of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> where he had placed Garrisons,
might remain to him with some augmentation, and that being agreed he
made a feast for all the company, where he proposed a reward for those who
excelled either in Drinking, Eating, Jesting or Singing, and in short all
sorts of Divertisements, from which only <hi>Gabinius</hi> excused himself. Thus
ended the second War between <hi>Mithridates</hi> and the Romans, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
lasted three years. Sometime after the King finding himself at peace,
subdued the Bosphorans. And made King of that Nation one of his Sons
called <hi>Machares.</hi> After that, he invaded the Acheans, which are on the
Frontiers of the Colches, and who as some say, are the remainder of those
who returning from the Wars of <hi>Troy,</hi> were brought by chance to that
Coast. But having lost one half of his Army partly by Ambushes, partly
in set battel, or by the Extremity of the Cold, he returned into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
from whence he sent Ambassadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ratifie by writing the
Articles of the Peace. <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> for his part whether of his own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or set on by some other, sent likewise to complain against him, that
he had not restored to him <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> for <hi>Mithridates</hi> still withheld a good
part. Whereupon <hi>Sylla</hi> ordained that <hi>Mithridates</hi> should absolutely quit
<hi>Cappadocia,</hi> which he did, and then again sent Ambassadors to <hi>Rome</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a Ratification of the Treaties. But because <hi>Sylla</hi> being dead, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
would move it in the Senate, he underhand engaged his Son in Law
<hi>Tigranes</hi> to make an irruption into <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> as done of himself, which
yet was not so closely carried, but the Romans had knowledge of it. The
Armenian however entred violently into <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and carried away into
<hi>Armenia</hi> three hundred thousand men whom he imployed with other
Country People in Tilling the Land. He had not yet taken the title of
<hi>Armenia,</hi> but now he assumed it, and caused <hi>Tigranocerta</hi> to be
called by his own Name, that is to say the City of <hi>Tigranes,</hi> these things
passed in <hi>Asia.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/> But <hi>Sertorius</hi> having siesed upon <hi>Spain,</hi> not only made an insurrection
in that Province, but among all the Neighboring People, against the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
and composed a kind of Senate of those of his Faction; of the
Number of his Senators, there were two of the name of <hi>Lucius,</hi> the one
<hi>Manius</hi> the other <hi>Fanius,</hi> who gave advice to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> that if he
he made an Alliance with <hi>Sertorius,</hi> he might soon become Master of the
greatest part of <hi>Asia,</hi> and the Nations thereunto confining. The King
suffered himself to be perswaded, and sent Ambassadors to him, whom he
caused to be brought into his Senate to receive Audience, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
spoken advantagiously of his own glory, the regulation of which had
reached even to the Kingdom of <hi>Pontus,</hi> so that he beheld himself in a
Condition to make War upon the Romans, both in the East and West, he
made an Alliance with <hi>Mithridates</hi> in favor of which he gave him in <hi>Asia,
Bithynia, Paphlagonia, Cappadocia,</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> and sent <hi>M. Varius</hi> to be
his General, and the two <hi>Lucii</hi> to serve him as Counsellors. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they counselled him to undertake this third War, wherein he lost all
his Empire, <hi>Sertorius</hi> being dead in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Romans having sent
against him two Generals, first <hi>Lucullus,</hi> who commanded the fleet under
<hi>Sylla,</hi> and after him <hi>Pompey</hi> under whose Conduct all the Estates of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:65196:87"/>
fell under the Roman Power, and with them all the Neighboring
Nations as far as <hi>Euphrates, Pompey</hi> taking from this way opportunity to
reduce them. <hi>Mithridates</hi> then who had already made trial of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Arms, and hoped for no favor, began this War, with great Gaiety
and Courage, laboring might and main in his preparations, as one resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to overcome or perish. He employ'd the rest of that Summer, and
all Winter in cutting down Materials, and building of Shipping, and forging
of Arms, and sent into his Sea Ports two Millions of <hi>Mina</hi>'s of<note n="*" place="margin">An uncertain measure.</note> Wheat; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
his old Troops he had presently great Numbers of Auxiliaries. Those
he raised in <hi>Asia,</hi> were composed of Chalybes, Armenians, Scythians,
Taurians, Achaeans, Heniochiens, Leucosyrians and those people inhabiting
on the Banks of the River <hi>Thermodoom</hi> called <hi>Amazones.</hi> Those he leavied
in Europe were Sarmatians, Basilides, Jaziges, Coralles, of all the People
of <hi>Thrace,</hi> near the River <hi>Ister,</hi> and the Mountains <hi>Rhodope</hi> and <hi>Haemus,</hi>
and likewise the Basternes the most Valiant Nation of all. Thus compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
the <hi>Europeans,</hi> his whole force was found to amount to one hundred
and forty thousand Foot, and sixteen thousand Horse, besides Multitudes of
Pioneers, Sutlers, and Merchants that followed the Army: Spring being
come he took a review of his Fleet, sacrificed to <hi>Iupiter Militaris</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Custom, and caused to be cast into the Sea a set of white
Horses Harnassed, as an offering to <hi>Neptune,</hi> and after all that marched
into <hi>Paphlagonia</hi> with his Forces, under the command of <hi>Taxiles</hi> and
<hi>Eumocrates</hi> his Lieutenant Generals; being arrived there, he made an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his Army, speaking proudly of his Predecessors and of himself, how
from a little Kingdom he had made it a mighty Empire, without ever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been overcome by the Romans, where himself was in Person. In
conclusion he declared against their unsatiable and unlimitted ambition,
which had even reduced <hi>Italy</hi> it self, their Native Country to Slavery.
Then he began to speak of their Infidelity towards him, refusing to ratifie
the Peace by writing, that they might be at liberty upon the first oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to renew the War; and then after having laid down the reasons
that induced him to the War, he began to talk wonders of his own prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations,
and to speak with contempt of the Roman affairs, whom <hi>Serto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
overpressed in <hi>Spain,</hi> and which in <hi>Italy</hi> were become deplorable by
domestick Seditions. <hi>'Tis for these reasons,</hi> said he, <hi>that though the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
have so long reigned at Sea, they have not been able to take any Course
with them, for they have no Allies that assist them, nor no Subjects but those
they keep in awe by force of Arms. See you not here said he</hi> (pointing to the
two <hi>Lucii) their most considerable Citizens, who have declared themselves
Enemies of their Country to make an Alliance with us.</hi> Having encouraged
his Army by these words, he made an Irruption into <hi>Bithynia,</hi> which <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedes</hi> lately deceased without Issue had given by will to the Roman peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<hi>Cotta</hi> was at present Governor, but being a heartless Man he fled
to <hi>Chalcedon</hi> with all his Forces. Thus <hi>Bithynia</hi> fell once more under the
power of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> the Romans being all retired with <hi>Cotta</hi> to <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
The King advancing to assault that City, <hi>Cotta</hi> who was nothing of
a Soldier durst not come to an incounter with him, but his Admiral cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Nudus,</hi> drew into the field with one half of the Army, and posted
himself in an advantagious place; yet he was driven thence, and forced
to fly towards one of the Gates of the City, where every one pressing to
enter, the Enemies that pursued them, threw no dart in vain upon a
Multitude so crouded together, those which guarded the Walls being in
fear for themselves, let down the Portcullis, and drawing up <hi>Nudus</hi> and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65196:88"/>
some other Officers by ropes, left the rest to mercy, who were slain in the
midst, between Friends and Enemies, stretching out their hands in vain to
one and the other. <hi>Mithridates</hi> thinking it best to pursue his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
caused his Fleet the same day to come about to the mouth of the Port,
and having broken the Iron Chain, that crossed it, burnt four of the
Enemies Ships, and Tow'd out the rest, about sixty in Number, at their
Sterns, whilst neither <hi>Nudus</hi> nor <hi>Cotta</hi> endeavored to prevent them,
not daring to stir out of the Circuit of their Walls. There died three
thousand Romans amongst whom was <hi>L. Manlius</hi> a Senator, <hi>Mithridates</hi>
lost only twenty Soldiers of his Basternes, who were most forward in the
assault of the Port.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XX"/> Soon after <hi>Lucius Lucullus</hi> sent to this War, brought with him one Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
from the City, to which those two of <hi>Fimbria</hi>'s, and two others
being joyned, so that he might have about thirty thousand Foot, and six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hundred Horse, he went and encamped near <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
<hi>Cysica,</hi> where having understood by the Runaway's that the King
had about three hundred thousand Men, and that what Provisions he had
were partly brought by Sea, and the remainder by those that went out on
Forrage, he turned himself to his people, and said he would soon have his
Enemies at discretion, bidding them remember what he now told them.
He observed after this a mountain very proper to encamp on, of which if
he could possess himself he might have abundance of Victuals, and on the
contrary the Enemy would want. Wherefore he designed to post himself
there, thinking it of infinite importance to overcome without danger.
There was only one very narrow avenue to it, of which <hi>Mithridates</hi> was
siesed and had placed there a strong guard, according to the advice of
<hi>Taxiles,</hi> and his other Captains, but <hi>Lucius Manius,</hi> who had been Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrator
of the Alliance betwixt <hi>Mithridates</hi> and <hi>Sertorius</hi> after the last was
dead, sent privately a man to <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and having got his word for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
perswaded the King to let the Romans pass, and incamp where they
pleased, because <hi>Fimbria</hi>'s Legions who had fought under <hi>Sertorius</hi> had a
design to yield themselves to him, and would do it in few days, and that
there was no need of the expence of blood or sweat, when they might van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
without fighting. Whereupon <hi>Mithridates</hi> doubting nothing, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
very imprudently to this advice, suffering the Romans to pass in all
security by the strait, and fortifie against himself a high mountain, of which
being once Masters, provisions might freely be brought to them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
whilst a Lake, Mountains and Rivers hindring the bringing of any
by Land to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> it soon began to grow scarce; besides he had no
way left to make a retreat by, nor could he by force draw <hi>Lucullus</hi> from
his post, having let go his advantage, and to all this Winter approached,
when no more Provision could come by Sea. Now <hi>Lucullus</hi> remembred
his friends of the promise he had made them, showing them the thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most done.
Not but that <hi>Mithridates</hi> possibly might, having such a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Men, have forced his passage through the midst of his Enemies:
but he chose rather to employ his power against <hi>Cysica,</hi> believing that the
taking of that City would prove a remedy both against the difficulty of the
way out, and the scarcity of Provision; And because his Army was so
vastly numerous he undertook at the same time all manner of ways to storm
it. He inclosed the Port where Ships were with a double Wall, drew
Lines of Circumvallation about the rest of the City, raised a great Number
of Platforms, Built Towers of Wood, and Batteries covered with Testudoes
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65196:88"/>
and other Engins, of which one which was the greatest was called <hi>Hellepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
one hundred Cubits large, on which was a tower furnished with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
to cast stones, and darts of all sorts. He likewise drew up close
to the Port, two Gallies joyned together, which bore a tower from which
they might lay a bridge to the wall. Things thus prepared he caused three
thousand Cysicenian prisoners, to be imbarked upon Vessels, and sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the walls, who when they came near, stretched forth their hands to
their fellow Citizens, beseeching them to have compassion of them in the
danger wherein they were. But <hi>Pisistratus</hi> Governor of the place caused
them to be told from the wall, that being now reduced under anothers
power, they ought to resolve with themselves, and with constancy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
their misfortune. This way not succeeding, <hi>Mithridates</hi> caused to
advance towards the wall, the Engine built on the two Gallies, and having
presently let fall the Bridge; four Soldiers leaped upon it and gained the
wall. The Cysicenians surprised at this Novelty, seemed at first to give a
little ground, but seeing no more hastned to follow them, they took heart,
and made those four leap from the top to the bottom. Then pouring pitch
on the Gallies, and casting fire on it, they forced the besiegers to retire;
and get off their Engine. Thus the assault from the Seaward proved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successful.
The same day a third attempt was made, they brought at the
same time, all the Batteries up to the Wall on the Land side, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
bravely defended themselves running from side to side, and from
one place to another, so wherever the Assault was most violent, they crash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in pieces the Engines with great Stones which they let fall upon them,
or turned off their blow with Cords, wherewith they intangled them, or
rendred them ineffectual by placing before them Sacks of Wool hung over
the wall, quenching their flaming Darts with Water and Vinegar, and
breaking off the force of the others by placing before them bundles of
Cloths, and Coverlids. In short, they put in practice all that the wit of
Man could invent to defend themselves; yet all the pains they took could
not prevent one part of the Wall, to which the besiegers had applied fire,
from falling before night, but the fury of the flame being then so great
that they durst not attempt to enter, and the besieged the same night built
up another Rampart from which they defended themselves, till such time
as there arose a mighty tempest, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> utterly broke to pieces all the Kings
Engins, and made them useless. 'Tis said that <hi>Iupiter</hi> gave this City in
Dower to <hi>Proserpina,</hi> whom the Cysicenians adore above all other Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
and that during the siege, her Feast day on which they used to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to her a Black Cow being come, and they having none of that hair
had made one of Paste to offer in Sacrifice to her, when behold at the
same time a Black Cow coming from the Sea, and cutting through the
waters, passed over the booms that were drawn cross the Port, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into it, ran through the City directly to the Temple, and stopt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Altar, on which the Inhabitants sacrificed it with hopes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.
<hi>Mithridates</hi> Friends upon this, advised him to raise his siege from
before this Sacred City, but he would not be moved. He got up to
Mount <hi>Dindymus</hi> which is above the City, from whence he caused to be
continued a Terrass or Platform directly to the Walls, upon which he
made Towers to be erected, he likewise wrought hard to undermine the
Walls, and having many useless Horses, some too lean for want of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and others lame for want of Shoo's, he sent them back to <hi>Bithynia,
Lucullus</hi> pursued them, and overtaking them at a passage of the River
<hi>Rhyndace</hi> made a great slaughter, took fifteen thousand Prisoners, six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65196:89"/>
Horses for Service, and a great Number of Beasts for Burthen.
Whilst these things passed at <hi>Cisica, Eumachus</hi> one of <hi>Mithridates</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
making inroads into <hi>Phrygia,</hi> with a flying Army, slew a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Romans with their Wives and Children, subdued the Pisidians the
Isaurians and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> till such time as <hi>Deiotarus</hi> one of the Tetrarchs of
<hi>Galatia</hi> drawing into the Field to pursue him, at last overtook him, defeated
him, and slew a great quantity of his people. Mean while Winter being
come, <hi>Mithridates</hi> found himself deprived of those few Provisions that
came by Sea, so that Famine surprised his Army, some dyed, and others
lived on dead Carkases, after the manner of the Barbarians, others again
feeding on nothing but Herbs, contracted mortal distempers, besides the
stink of the Corps that lay in the Fields unburied brought the Plague a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them. Yet for all this <hi>Mithridates</hi> courage failed not, for he hoped
at last to take the City by the Terrass he was raysing from Mount <hi>Dindy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
But when the Inhabitants had undermined that and burnt all his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines,
and that knowing his Soldiers were weakned by Famine, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to vex him with continual Sallies, he resolved to raise his Siege, he
therefore embarqued by night to go with his Fleet to <hi>Para,</hi> and his Land
Army took their march towards <hi>Lampsacus,</hi> but because the River <hi>Aesopus</hi>
was more swoln then ordinary, <hi>Lucullus</hi> overtook them at the Passage, slew
a great Number, and pursued the rest as far as that Town, to which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
laid Siege, <hi>Mithridates</hi> sent Shipping thither, and brought away both
Soldiers and Inhabitants by Sea. After this he left in one part of his Ships,
ten thousand chosen men, commanded by that <hi>Varius</hi> whom <hi>Sertorius</hi>
had sent to him. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Paphlagonian, and <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Eunuch, and
himself went towards <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> with the rest which where the greatest
Number, but the greatest part of the one and other, perished by storm:
Thus the Cisicenians so powerfully assailed saved themselves, by their
own Valour, and by the assistance of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> who starved the Enemies
Army. Wherefore to this day they exhibit solemn Plays in memory of him
which they call Lucullians.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXI"/> Now the Consul after having so well succeeded by Land, by means of the
Famine, distributed those Ships he had caused to come from <hi>Asia,</hi> to his
Lieutenants, of whom one called <hi>Triarius</hi> made a descent at <hi>Apamia,</hi> forced
the City, and made a horrible Slaughter of the Inhabitants who had taken
Sanctuary in the Temples. The other called <hi>Barba</hi> made himself Master of
<hi>Nicea,</hi> and <hi>Prutiade</hi> seated on a Mountain, both deserted by <hi>Mithridates</hi>
Garrisons, and then keeping the Sea, went and took thirteen of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Ships out of the very port of the <hi>Achaeans.</hi> And having met near <hi>Lemnos</hi>
with <hi>Varius, Alexander</hi> and <hi>Dionysius</hi> in a desert Isle, where is to be seen the
Altar of <hi>Philoctetes,</hi> tyed about with a brazen Serpent, a Bow and a Cors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
tyed about with Bands, which are the Monuments of his misfortune.
He made directly towards them, without knowing who they were, but
seeing they stood firm, he sent off only two Ships to draw the Enemies to
a Battel, who would not quit the road, but were content to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from the Land, he therefore sent other Ships about, who putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shore
some foot on the other side of the Island, he by that means forced
them again to betake themselves to their Ships, but they not daring to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
out to Sea, for fear of <hi>Lucullus,</hi> but coasting along, were beaten both by
Sea and Land, with a great slaughter, and a strange discomfiture. The
three Commanders were taken, hid in a Cave. <hi>Dionysius</hi> having drunk
poison he had with him dyed instantly. <hi>Varius</hi> was slain by <hi>Lucullus</hi> his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65196:89"/>
order, who thought it improper to lead a Roman Senator in Triumph, but
<hi>Alexander</hi> was reserved for that Pomp. This done <hi>Lucullus</hi> gave advice to
the Senate by letter, which he sent with Laurels, according to the custome
of the Victorious, and took his march towards <hi>Bithynia.</hi> As for <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ddates</hi>
as he sailed towards <hi>Pontus,</hi> he was twice battered by Tempest,
whereby he lost ten thousand men, and sixty Ships, the rest being dispers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as the Wind carried them, and he, the Admiral being split, contrary
to the advice of his Friends, embarked in a Pyrates Vessel, which brought
him to <hi>Sinope,</hi> from thence he went to <hi>Amisa,</hi> and there dispatched away
into <hi>Armenia</hi> to his Son in law <hi>Tigranes</hi> and into <hi>Bosphorus</hi> to <hi>Machares,</hi> his
Son, to leavy speedily Auxiliary Forces; and deputed <hi>Diocles</hi> to the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Scythians with presents and a great Sum of Money. But he
went both with Presents and Money, and surrendred himself to <hi>Lucullus;</hi>
who in the mean time pursuing his Victory still, advanced with his Army,
subduing and plundring all as he went<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that being entred into a rich
Country, and which for a long time had known no War, he found every
thing so extraordinary cheap, that a Slave was sold for four Drachms, an
Ox for a Drachm, and Goats, Sheep and Cloths at a proportionable rate.
At length he besieged <hi>Amisa</hi> and <hi>Eupatoria,</hi> which <hi>Mithridates</hi> caused to be
built near <hi>Amisa,</hi> calling it by his own Name, and designing it for the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Kings. He assaulted it with Towers, Terrasses, and Mines so
vast, that they oftimes fought underground, besides the besieged having
met with their Works, and opened them from the City side, did with
Hives of Bees drive against the Labourers, Bears, and other Wild Beasts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But yet he found more difficulty at the siege of <hi>Amisa,</hi> for the Inhabitants
defended themselves gallantly, making frequent Sallies, and provoking the
Besiegers to fight man to man. Besides <hi>Mithridates</hi> supplied them with as
much Provision, Arms and Soldiers as he pleased, which he sent from <hi>Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
where he spent the Winter, in gathering together another Army,
which he soon found to amount to forty thousand foot and four thousand
Horse. About the beginning of the Spring <hi>Lucullus</hi> took the Field, and
took up towards the Mountains to march against the King, who to hinder
the Consuls passage had placed there very good Troops, with orders to
give him notice by fires of whatever passed. They were commanded by
<hi>Phoenix,</hi> a man of reputation, and of the Blood Royal, who soon gave the
Signal of <hi>Lucullus</hi> coming according to appointment, but went and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erd
up himself and his Forces to him, so that having securely passed the
Mountains he descended to <hi>Cabires,</hi> where being defeated in a Battel of
the Horse, he again recovered the Mountain, <hi>Pompey</hi> Colonel of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry
was wounded and brought before the King, who asking him what he
would do for him, if he gave him his life. <hi>Much</hi> (said he) <hi>provided you
become a Friend to</hi> Lucullus, <hi>but as long as you are his Enemy, I have nothing
to say.</hi> Upon this answer the Barbarians would have killed him: but the
King prevented them saying he would never injure Valour forsaken by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
After this he several times drew up his Army in Battel in the
Plain, and seeing that <hi>Lucullus</hi> would not descend, he observed on all sides
how he might gain the Mountain. Mean while a certain Scythian called
<hi>Olcaba,</hi> who had sometime before fled out of the Kings Army to <hi>Lucullus,</hi>
and had saved a great part of his Forces in the last Battel of the Horse, and
therefore eat at the Generals Table, and was of his Counsel, and had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his secrets, came to his Tent, as he reposed in the heat of the
day, and would needs enter, having no Arms about him, but a little Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
which he usually wore; But when the Guards stopped him he grew
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65196:90"/>
angry telling them that there was a necessity to wake <hi>Lucullus,</hi> but they
told him again, that nothing was more necessary for <hi>Lucullus</hi> as life.
Whereupon he mounted on horseback, and went and surrendred himself
to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> whether it were that he believed himself suspected, or
that he was angry at the injury he imagined he had received, he presently
discovered to the King another Scythian called <hi>Sobadacus,</hi> who being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested,
was accused of a design of going over to <hi>Lucullus,</hi> who stayed still
on the Mountain; for he would not descend into the plain, because the
Enemies were stronger in Horse, so that seeing no other way to go to
<hi>Mithridates</hi> he found in a Cave a Huntsman, who knew all the ways, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whose Conduct he came, by unknown passages just over the head of
<hi>Mithridates,</hi> from whence he descended, and without entring the plain
where the Enemies Horse lay, he went and pitched his Camp, behind a
certain Channel full of Water; being there encamped he would soon have
been in want of Provision; but he sent for Corn as far as <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and
was continually skirmishing with the Enemy, till <hi>Mithridates</hi> one day, as
those of his party fled issuing out of his Camp, ran to meet them, and after
having reviled them with reproachful words, forced them to turn head
again, which struck such a terror into the Romans that they fled, and all in
a breath run up to the Mountain, continuing their flight a long time after
the Kings party had given over the chase of them, for every one took the
companion of his flight for an Enemy, so much had fear distracted them.
<hi>Mithridates</hi> puft up with this success sent through all the Territories un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Dominion, news of that Victory, and drew off the greatest and
best part of his Horse, giving them Order to Ransack <hi>Lucullus</hi> his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragers,
as they brought Corn from <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> hoping to reduce him to as
great necessity of Victuals as himself had been at <hi>Cysica.</hi> And indeed it
was a plausible Design to cut of <hi>Lucullus</hi> Provisions which could be brought
to him from no other part but <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> but the Kings Horsemen meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Vanguard of the Forragers in certain straits, where their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
could hardly do any service, had not the patience to stay till they were
come into the open plain. The Romans presently put themselves into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and favored as they were by the advantage of the place, killed a great
many of their Enemies, drove others down the Precipices, and put all the
rest to the Rout. Some saved themselves by night in the Camp, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
they only were escaped made the noise of this defeat, though truly
it were great, much greater then indeed it was. And because this news
came sooner to <hi>Mithridates</hi> then to <hi>Lucullus,</hi> the King judging that after
the loss of his Cavalry, the Enemy would not fail to fall upon him, grew
fearful, and disposed himself to remove thence, of which at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
he gave notice to his friends, that were in his Tent; But they
without staying till he published the march, sent every one out of the
Camp before day, his Equipage, with such hast that at the Gate the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage-horses
overthrew one another. This being observed by the Soldiers
who knew those that led the Horses, their fear increased their suspicion,
and the whole Army thinking themselves wronged, that they had not
all notice of it, in a fury flew to the Palisade, broke it down, and spread
themselves in disorder through the Plain, every one flying what way he
thought best, notwithstanding all their Generals and Officers could do
to prevent it. The King himself could not appease this Tumult and
Rage; for when he perceived it, he went out of his Tent to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but not being listned to by any one, he threw himself on the ground
in the midst of the croud, from whence being taken up, and set on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65196:90"/>
he fled by the way of the Mountains, with very few in his Train.
<hi>Lucullus</hi> having intelligence of the Victory of the Forragers, and seeing
the flight of his Enemies, sent the greatest part of his Horse to give them
chase, and incompassed with his Foot those who remained in the Camp
prepared to receive the assault. He had before strictly forbid the Soldiers
to plunder, till the Enemy were utterly defeated: but when they beheld
so many Vessels of Gold and Silver, and so much costly Rayment, they
quite forgot his Orders. <hi>Mithridates</hi> himself had been taken, had they
not cut open, and straw'd abroad some Males full of Gold, wherewith a
Mule was loaden, which while those that followed him, busied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to gather up; he escaped to <hi>Comanes,</hi> from whence he went with
two thousand Horse towards <hi>Tigranes,</hi> who would not see him, but gave
him some Castles for his abode, and caused him to be treated and served
like a King. Insomuch, that despairing of ever entring again into his
Kingdom, he sent an Eunuch, called <hi>Bacchus,</hi> to his Seraglio, to put to
death in any manner whatever, his Sisters, his Wives, and his Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines.
They became their own Executioners, and either by Steel, Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or a Halter ended their Lives, of which the Governours of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons
left by <hi>Mithridates</hi> having advice, surrendred (all but a very few)
to <hi>Lucullus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucullus</hi> after this seeing himself Master of the Province, went about to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXII"/>
all the Cities setling his orders. And causing his Fleet to come before the
maritime places, he soon took <hi>Amastris, Heraclea,</hi> and all the rest except
<hi>Sinope,</hi> which for some time generously defended it self, and got the better
of him in a Sea f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight. But when the Inhabitants saw they must be taken,
they set on fire their largest Ships, and going on board their lighter Vessels,
fled. Sometime after he restored them their liberty, being thereto advertised
by his Dream. 'Tis said that <hi>Autolycus</hi> the Companion of <hi>Hercules,</hi> in his
expedition against the <hi>Amazones</hi> being driven by tempest into <hi>Sinope,</hi> reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there, and that after his death, his Statue was reverenced as a God, and
uttered Oracles. Those of <hi>Sinope</hi> willing to have their God along with
them, when they fled, wrapt it up in Linnen, and tyed it round with Cords,
to carry it away the more secretly, but though <hi>Lucullus</hi> knew nothing of
it, nor no one living had given him notice, he thought he saw that God
calling to him, and on the morrow as some passed by him, carrying that
<hi>Statua</hi> so bound up, he commanded them to unfold the Linnen that cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it, and beheld the same Image that had appeared to him. So this
Dream proved advantagious to the Cittizens of <hi>Sinope. Lucullus</hi> likewise
restored to liberty the Citizens of <hi>Amisa,</hi> who like the others had escaped
away by Sea. He had heard tell that in the same time when the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
were Masters of the Sea, they had sent thither a Colony, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
a Government of which the people had the Administration, that
afterwards that City falling under the Dominion of the Kings of <hi>Persia,
Alexander</hi> first restored them to that liberty which afterwards the Kings of
<hi>Pontus</hi> had deprived them of. Whereupon he took pity on them and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
the goodness of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and in favour of the <hi>Attick</hi> people, he
made it free, and gave order that the Inhabitants as well of <hi>Amisa</hi> as <hi>Sino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,</hi>
should forthwith return to their dwellings. After these two places were
thus taken by <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and restored to liberty, one of the Sons of <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi>
called <hi>Machares</hi> King of the <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> having sent him a Crown of
Gold, he received him into the friendship of the people of <hi>Rome.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
he dispatched Messengers to <hi>Tigranes,</hi> to demand <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65196:91"/>
then marching towards <hi>Asia,</hi> which still owed one fourth part of their fruits
of the fine adjudged by <hi>Sylla,</hi> he imposed a Tribute upon them according to
the Value of their houses, and the number of their Slaves, withal sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
to the Gods of Victory, as if his Enemies had been already totally
overcome. The Sacrifices performed, he marched forward with two
chosen Legions, and five hundred Horse, to make War upon <hi>Tigranes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he would not deliver up <hi>Mithridates</hi> to him. As soon as his Army had
passed the <hi>Euphrates</hi> he went on without doing any injury to the <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
save only making them pay contribution, for the people of these
Countries were Enemies to War, and would not engage themselves in the
differences between <hi>Tigranes</hi> and <hi>Lucullus.</hi> No one durst give advice to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes</hi>
of <hi>Lucullus</hi> design, for one unhappy man that adventured but to
speak of it, was hanged up as a disturber of the publick Peace, but at last
when he saw he came on, he sent <hi>Mithrobarzanes</hi> before with two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horse, to oppose his march, and gave orders to <hi>Manceus</hi> to make
hast to <hi>Tigranocerta</hi> to defend that place. This King (as we have said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
had caused this City to be built for the Glory of his Name, and to the
intent that he might people it with Persons of Quality and Condition, had
by Edict declared that all moveables were not brought thither, should be
confiscated. The Walls were fifty Cubits high, at the foot of which there
were Stables quite round. He had likewise in the Suburbs built a most stately
Palace, with magnificent Gardens, and a great number of Channels full
of Fish, with Parks for Beasts, and some distance from thence a strong
and beautiful Citadel: All these things he committed to <hi>Manceus</hi> Guards,
whilst he on all sides levyed Forces to compose an Army. Mean while
<hi>Lucullus</hi> meeting with <hi>Mithrobarzanes,</hi> soon defeated him,
and gave him
chase; and <hi>Sextilius</hi> having shut up <hi>Manceus</hi> in <hi>Tigranocerta,</hi> pillaged the
Royal Palace without the Walls, besieged the City, planted his Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and set the Miners to work. Whilst <hi>Sextilius</hi> was busied at this
siege, <hi>Tigranes</hi> had gathered together two hundred and fifty thousand
Foot, and fifty thousand Horse; about six thousand of which he sent to
<hi>Tigranocerta,</hi> who opening a passage through the midst of the Roman
Army, rescued from thence the Kings Concubines, and carried them
away with them. For his part he marched against <hi>Lucullus,</hi> with the
rest of his Forces, where <hi>Mithridates</hi> came to him, and advised him not
to come to a set battel with the Romans, but to keep the Field with his
Horse, and wast all the Country round about their Army: so that, if
possible he might serve him in the same manner, as <hi>Lucullus</hi> had done
his Army before <hi>Cysica,</hi> and destroy them without fighting. But the
Barbarian laughing at this advice, continued his March always in order
of Battel, and seeing the small number of the Romans, said in a Jeer:
<hi>If they be Ambassadors, they are a great many, but if they be Enemies they
are very few. Lucullus</hi> having taken notice of a Hill behind <hi>Tigranes</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
gave order to his Cavalry to go charge the Enemy in Front, and to
betake themselves to flight, as soon as they had drawn them on to a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
to the end, the Barbarians might break their Ranks to pursue them,
whilst he with the Infantry, taking a compass, went and gained the Hill,
without being perceived by the Enemy: When he saw them scattered
and in disorder, in chase of his Horse, as if they had already been victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;
and their Baggage remaining at the foot of the Hill, he crying out
<hi>the Victory is ours fellow Soldiers,</hi> went down, and first of all charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Train and Baggage Horses, who forthwith betaking themselves to
flight, pressed upon the Foot, and the Foot did the like upon the Horse;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65196:91"/>
so that the whole Army was immediately in a rout; for on one side the
Roman Horse turning head against those, who had separated themselves
from the main Body to pursue them, cut them in pieces; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, the Baggage Horses, as if they had been thrust forward, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
all they met with; and the whole multitude pressing one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by reason of their great number, without knowing the reason of
the disorder, the Romans made a wonderful slaughter. Not a man stopt
now to plunder, for <hi>Lucullus</hi> had expresly forbid it, with severe threats
on the transgressors. Wherefore trampling under foot Collars and Chains
of Gold, they followed the Massacre for the space of<note n="*" place="margin">Fifteen miles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> sixscore Furlongs,
till night coming on, they returned back, and spoiled the dead, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
then given them by <hi>Lucullus.</hi> After this defeat, <hi>Manceus,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Tigranocerta,</hi> disarmed all the Mercenary Greek Soldiers in the
City, having entertained some suspicion of them: Wherefore they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be likewise made Prisoners, got them Clubs, and trooped together;
so that they parted not one from another, either marching or standing still.
And when <hi>Manceus</hi> came to charge them with some armed Barbarians,
they wrapt their left Arm in their Coats instead of Bucklers; and running
desperately into the midst of their Enemies, slew a great number, whose
Arms they divided amongst them; when they thought they had Arms
enough to serve their turn, they went and seised upon some Towers that
flanked the Walls, from whence they called to the besiegers, and helping
them to mount upon the Wall, made them Masters of the City. Thus
<hi>Tigranocerta</hi> newly built, whither out of meer vanity Inhabitants were
forced to come form all parts, became a prize, and enriched the Army
with a most prodigious booty. <hi>Tigranes</hi> and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> in the mean
time, gave orders to set on foot another Army, of which <hi>Mithridates</hi> had
the command, because the other thought him more capable, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
by the experience of so many losses; they sent likewise to demand
assistance from the Parthians; but <hi>Lucullus</hi> having likewise dispatched to
that King, to request him to assist him with his Forces, rather than the
others, or at least to be but a looker on; he in particular promised both
parties, but kept his word neither with one nor the other. There was
no City but <hi>Mithridates</hi> set on work to forge Arms, nor scarce a person
in <hi>Armenia</hi> capable to bear them, but came and enrolled himself in these
new Levies. But he thought it not best to employ such a multitude, he
chose only seventy thousand Foot, and half as many Horse of the ablest
Men, and dismissed the rest: And after having distributed them into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
and Regiments, almost according to the Italian Discipline; he gave
it in charge to the old Pontick Soldiers to exercise them. They were no
sooner in the Field, but <hi>Lucullus</hi> appeared resolved to fight: but <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>
kept firm upon an Eminence, where he had posted himself with all
his Foot; and the greatest part of his Horse; and <hi>Tigranes</hi> being gone
with the rest to charge the Romans, who were forraging abroad was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated,
which gave liberty to the Romans, for the future, to fetch Corn
without any fear, to forrage in the very face of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and to draw
nearer to his Camp. At last the Kings were resolved to block up <hi>Lucullus</hi>
in the midst between them; to this end <hi>Tigranes</hi> took the Field, but the
dust discovering his March, the General, who knew their design, drew off
the flower of his Horse, with Orders to go as far as they could to meet the
Armenian, and to charge him before he could put his people in order.
Mean while he did all he could to draw <hi>Mithridates</hi> to a battel, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
the making a Ditch round about the Hill, but he could not oblige.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65196:92"/>
him to descend, till Famine beginning to afflict both Armies, they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
without doing any thing. <hi>Tigranes</hi> into the heart of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and
<hi>Mithridates</hi> into what was left him of the Kingdom of <hi>Pontus,</hi> with four
thousand Men of his own, and as many of <hi>Tigranes. Lucullus</hi> followed
them in the Rear; but being himself oppressed with want of Provision,
he returned back again: and <hi>Mithridates</hi> having made a swifter March
than could be imagined, surprised <hi>Fabius,</hi> whom the Consul had left to
command there, and forced him to betake himself to flight, after having
five hundred of his Men slain; yet he returned to the charge, strengthed
with the assistance of all the Slaves that followed the Army, to whom he
gave their liberty, and held out the fight all that day, till such time as
<hi>Mithridates</hi> wounded with the blow of a Stone on the Knee, and with an
Arrow below the Eye, was suddenly carried out of the Battel. This oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
the passing away of some days without fighting, whether the
Enemies were in pain for the Kings health, or whether their wounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
rest. However it were, the King was soon cured, being drest with
medicaments composed of the Poyson of Serpents, by the <hi>Agbares,</hi> Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
by Nation, who for this purpose always followed the Court. To <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
succeeded <hi>Triarius,</hi> who brought a new Army of <hi>Lucullus</hi> his Forces,
with which he presently marched against <hi>Mithridates;</hi> but as they were
ready to engage, both sides were forced to part, there arising such a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Tempest, as had never being seen in the memory of man; it threw
down the Tents of both Camps, carryed the Beasts of Burthen out of the
way, and likewise took up some Soldiers and threw them among the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices.
Upon the Rumour of <hi>Lucullus</hi> his coming, <hi>Triarius</hi> desirous to do
some memorable action whilst he commanded, went about break of day to
make an assault upon <hi>Mithridates</hi> Out-guards. They sought a long time
with equal Fortune, but at last the King making an onset with the Wing in
which he was, began to overcome, broke the Romans and drove their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry
into a miry Valley, where the Soldiers not able to stand upright, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
themselves to be killed without any resistance. After which pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his advantage he fell into the Rear of the Cavalry, to whom he gave
chase with much eagerness, when a Roman<note n="*" place="margin">Captain of an hundred m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n.</note> Centurion Galloping by his
side as if he had been one of his Train, gave him a great wound with his
Sword in the thigh, for he was doubtful if he should have struck him in the
Reins he should not have pierced his Armour. The Roman was present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cut in pieces by the Guards, and <hi>Mithridates</hi> carried into the Rear of his
Army. However they ceased not pursuing the Victory, which had been
much greater, had not those who were about the King, caused the retreat
to be sounded. This surprised those who followed the Chase, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
them strangely; for they were fearful, left some misfortune were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
elsewere, till such time as the thing being known, they came and
gathered in Throngs about the wounded King, in the midst of the Plain,
where <hi>Timotheus</hi> his Chirurgion having stopt the blood, showed them
him standing, as <hi>Alexander</hi> was in the <hi>Indies</hi> shown to the Macedonians, who
were in fear for his safety. <hi>Mithridates</hi> himself would needs be drest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Arlop of a Ship, to the end every one might see him, where being
somewhat recovered, he reproved those who had caused the Retreat to be
sounded, and the same day caused his Army to march towards the Roman
Camp, which they for fear had already deserted, there were found among
the dead, four and twenty Tribunes, and one hundred and fifty Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
nor ever did the Romans in one only defeat loose so many Officers.
After this Victory, the King retired into <hi>Armenia</hi> called the less, carrying
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65196:92"/>
along with him all Provisions that he could transport, and corrupting what
he left, left if <hi>Lucullus</hi> came into that Country, he should make use of
them. At the same time a certain Roman Senator called <hi>Attilius</hi> who for
fear left process should be made against him, had escaped to <hi>Mithridates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
and had by him been received with all possible demonstrations of friendship,
was convict of a plot against his person. Yet he would not out of respect
to his former Dignity, let him be put to the Torture, but was content to
let him suffer an ordinary death: but his accomplices were cruelly torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
save only those of his freed man, to whom he had communicated his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
whom the King let go because they had only obeyed their Master. As
for <hi>Lucullus</hi> he soon was come up to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and was now upon the
point to engage with him, when the Proconsul of <hi>Asia</hi> sent to proclaim
through all the Province, that the Senate blamed <hi>Lucullus</hi> for having spun
out the War so long and therefore dismissed the Army, injoyning the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
not to stay any longer upon pain of confiscation of their Goods. The
news of this Ordinance being come to the Camp, most began to file off,
there remaining only with <hi>Lucullus</hi> some poor Wretches who having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to loose, feared no confiscations. Thus <hi>Lucullus</hi> no more then those
before him, could not make an end of this War, for the Allies being revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the City afflicted with Famine, by reason that the Pyrates
were Masters of the Sea, it was not thought proper to embroyl themselves
in so great a War, till they were delivered from the present Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mithridates</hi> having advice hereof entred into <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and began to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIII"/>
reestablish himself in his own Kingdom, which the Romans dissembled till
such time as the Sea was cleared of Pyrates: but after the Pyrates were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
by <hi>Pompey,</hi> and that he was come into <hi>Asia,</hi> they renewed the War
against <hi>Mithridates,</hi> giving that great Captain Commission to be their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
Wherefore what this great man acted on the Sea before he bore
Arms against <hi>Mithridates,</hi> making a part of that expedition, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to another History, I am of the mind to make a Summary recital of
it in the place. <hi>Mithridates</hi> at the beginning of his first War against the
Romans having made himself Master of <hi>Asia,</hi> because <hi>Sylla</hi> was then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in <hi>Greece</hi> about Affairs of importance, believing that his Dominion
there would be of no long durance, spoiled all that Country, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all those Cruelties we have related. He likewise at the same time sent
forth Pyrates who at first coasting up and down with a few small Barques,
only got some booty, but the War growing hot, they encreased in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and fitted out great Ships, and afterwards finding a sweetness in the
vastness of their gain, whether the King were overcome, or whether he
had made Peace, or whether the were in flight, they continued their Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
for they said that having lost their Goods, and abandoned their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
by reason of the War, necessity had driven them from the Land, to
seek their Fortune for the future by Sea. They elected among themselves
Arch-pyrates, who commanded a certain Number, as if it had been a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
War. They assaulted weak Cities, and sometimes very strong ones too,
whose Walls they either scaled or threw down. They pillaged them after
they had taken them, carrying to their places of retreat all the rich men
they took, to make them pay their ransome, and giving their Crimes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
names they shook off the name of Pyrates, and called themselves
Soldiers adventurers. They had likewise Artificers whom they kept in Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and continually stored up Wood, Iron, Brass, and other Materials.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:65196:93"/>
For their vast booty had so heightned their courages, that preferring that
kind of life before any other, they imagined themselves Soveraigns, and
Kings, comparing their Power to that of Armies, and esteeming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
invincible, when ever they pleased to unite together, they built Ships
and forged Arms especially in <hi>Cilicia</hi> called the Rough, which was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
retreat of all these Corsairs, or as we may saw the principal Seat of
War. Not but that they had in other places Castles and Forts in desart Islands
and cunning Harbours, but they usually retired to that Coast of <hi>Cilicia</hi> the
Rough, which was inaccessible, and bounded with Rocks reaching almost
out of sight, and therefore all the World commonly called them Cilicians.
This mischief which was begun in <hi>Cilicia</hi> infected likewise the Syrians,
Ciprians, Pamphilians, Pontick Nations, and almost all the Oriental peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who tyred with the length of the <hi>Mithridatick</hi> War, and choosing
rather to do ill then suffer it, changed their dwellings on Land for the Sea,
so that in a short time they amounted to many thousands, and not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Masters of the Sea that wets the Oriental Coasts, but spread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
throughout all the Seas as far as the Pillars of <hi>Hercules,</hi> for they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
some Roman Pretors in Sea Fights, and among others the Pretor of
<hi>Sicily.</hi> No Ship durst appear about that Island, the very Husband-man had
abandoned the Fields, because of the continual descents they made, which
very much annoyed he Romans, for besides that they beheld their Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
pillaged, want of Corn brought a Famine into the Citie. Besides it was
not easie to defeat such great Forces, that spread themselves over all parts
both of the Sea and Land. Who were alwaies ready either to fly or fight,
whilst none knew their Country or place of retreat, nor indeed had they
any residence or propriety, but what fell in their hands. Wherefore these
extraordinary kind of Enemies who gave themselves a dispensation against
all the Laws of War, of whom nothing clear or certain could be made
out, were very formidable, and few would have accepted a Commission
for this War. For <hi>Murena</hi> having undertaken these Pyrates did nothing
memorable, no more did after him <hi>Servilius Isauricus.</hi> They were grown
so bold as to Land upon the Coasts of <hi>Brundusium</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">Tuscany.</note> 
                  <hi>Hetruria,</hi> from
whence they carried away some Women of Quality whom they found in
the Country. And defeated two Bodies of an Army, whose Eagles they
carried away. The Romans no longer able to suffer these Losses and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts,
by Decree of the Senate, gave to <hi>Pompey</hi> the greatest man of that
time Command of their Armies for three Years, with Authority over all
the Seas, as far as the Pillars of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and within all the Maritime
Provinces for<note n="*" place="margin">Fifty Miles.</note> four hundred Furlongs from the Sea, and to Command all
Kings, Governours and Cities, to furnish him with necessaries. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him likewise to make new Leavies, both of men and Monies, and
in the mean time gave him an Army composed of standing Legions, all
the Ships they had, and six thousand Attick Talents in ready Money. So
difficult a thing they believed it to overcome so many Naval Armies, to
pursue them in so vast an extent of Seas, and to seek them out in so many
holes, having to do with Enemies, they could not get within reach of
except they pleased, and who were ready to fall on, when they were least
thought of. Nor indeed did ever any Roman General go to War with so
large a Commission as <hi>Pompey</hi>'s. Soon after they furnished him with six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
thousand foot, four thousand Horse, and two hundred and seventy
Ships, comprizing the Brigantines, and for his Lieutenants, they gave
him five and twenty Senators, among whom he divided the Seas, giving
them Horse and Foot and Shipping, with the Ensigns of Pretor. Every
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65196:93"/>
Lieutenant had absolute power in the Quarter he Commanded, and he
like a King of Kings, went from one part to another, to disperse his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and to see that every one kept in his Post without quitting it, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
the Enemy far from it, if he could not gain the Victory upon the
place, to the end that there being alwaies people in a readiness in all places,
to take up what others had not fully done, the Pyrates might find<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in flying from place to place. After having disposed things in this
manner, he gave the Commission of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Streit to <hi>Tib. Nero</hi>
and <hi>Manlius Torquatus</hi> joyntly, of the<note n="*" place="margin">Gaul.</note> Celtrick and<note n="*" place="margin">Genoua.</note> Ligustique Sea, to
<hi>Marius Pomponius;</hi> of <hi>Affrica</hi> with <hi>Sardinia, Corsica</hi> and the Circumadia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Islands to <hi>Lentulus Marcellinus,</hi> and <hi>P. Attilius;</hi> of the Coast of <hi>Italy</hi>
from <hi>Sicily</hi> to <hi>Acarnania</hi> to <hi>L. Gellius</hi> and <hi>Cn. Lentulus;</hi> of the <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea
to <hi>Plotius Varus</hi> and <hi>Terentius Varro;</hi> of <hi>Peloponesus, Attica, Euboea, Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saly,
Macedon</hi> and <hi>Boeotia</hi> to <hi>L. Cinna;</hi> of all the <hi>Aegaean</hi> Sea, and the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lespont</hi>
to <hi>L. Cullius.</hi> Of <hi>Bithynia, Thrace</hi> the <hi>Propontick,</hi> and the mouth of
<hi>Pontus</hi> to <hi>L. Piso,</hi> of <hi>Lycia, Pamphilia; Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Phoenicia</hi> to <hi>Metellus
Nepos.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Note, there were 25 Lieutenants, and here are Commissions but for 1. 3.</note> These were the Quarters he assigned every Lieutenant, where
they were to fight, and to give them their Chase; so that saving themselves
from one, they might fall into the hands of another, forbidding them to
pursue beyond their Bounds, for fear lest those long Chases might be a
means to delay the War, for his own part he flew (if one may so say)
from one part to another, to see what passed, and having in forty days
gone the Circuit of the Western part of the Sea, he returned to <hi>Rome</hi>
from whence he went to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> where again taking Shipping, and
running over all those vast Oriental Seas, he brought every where a dread
of his Name, by the swiftness of his motion, the greatness of his Force
and Power, and the opinion had of a Captain of such high reputation. So
that the Pyrates who as it was thought would have assaulted him, or at
least would have found ways to have made his Victory difficult, presently
raised their Siege, before those Towns they had blocked up, and out of
the fear they had of him, retired into their Forts, and sheltring places.
Thus <hi>Pompey</hi> cleared the Seas without fighting, and his Lieutenants every
one in their Quarter took all the Corsairs that haunted there. After this
he went into <hi>Cilicia</hi> with a great number of Soldiers and Workmen, and
store of Engines, believing he should be put to the assaulting after sundry
manners those Forts built upon such high Rocks. But the renown of his
name alone and the vastness of his preparations struck such a terror into the
Pyrates, that they believed they should make the better composition if
they yielded without fighting. Those who were in the two largest Forts,
called <hi>Crague</hi> and <hi>Anticrague</hi> were the first who submitted at discretion, and
after them all those who held the Mountains of <hi>Cilicia</hi> one after another,
yielded themselves with great quantities of Arms, either already furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or else only begun in the Shops, besides a great number of Ships, some
half built, others ready to sail, with Copper, Iron, Canvas, Cordage, and
divers others Materials, which they had gathered together for their use.
There were found also many Captives which they kept there, some for
Ransome, others to labour in their works. <hi>Pompey</hi> burnt all their unwrought
Materials, carried the Ships along with him and sent the Captives home<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
many of whom found that their Funerals had been performed, their friends
believing them dead. As for the Pyrates who appeared not to have enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
themselves in this kind of life, but because they had lost their substance
by the War, he assigned them for their dwellings, <hi>Malle, Adane, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phania</hi>
and such other Cities as were but thinly inhabited in the upper <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia,</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:65196:94"/>
some of them likewise he sent to <hi>Dima</hi> in <hi>Achaia.</hi> Thus the War
against the Pyrates, which all Men thought would have been long, was
ended in a few days by <hi>Pompey.</hi> There were seventy two Ships taken, three
hundred yielded up, with sixscore Towers, Forts and others places of
retreat, and about ten thousand slain of those who stood out upon their
Defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIV"/> After this so expeditious victory, the success of which exceeded all Mens
hopes, the Senate and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> in acknowledgement of the
great Service done by <hi>Pompey</hi> conferred on him signal Honors. They gave
him the Commission of the War against <hi>Mithridates,</hi> continued to him the
same Power to make Peace and War, and at his own Arbitrement to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
Friends and Enemies to the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> those whom he should
think Worthy, and over and above all this made him Generalissimo of all
their Forces out of <hi>Italy.</hi> Never before had the People of <hi>Rome</hi> given so
much Power to one Man at once, which possibly was the Reason, why
they called him GREAT, for as to any thing else, the other Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
had before left but little to do in this War. <hi>Pompey</hi> then having
Assembled the Forces of <hi>Asia,</hi> went and encamped on the Frontiers of
<hi>Mithridates</hi> Estates, who had at present a very gallant Army, composed
of thirty thousand Foot, and three thousand Horse all chosen Men, raised
upon his own Lands for the defence of his Kingdom. <hi>Lucullus</hi> had not
long before spoiled all that Country, so that victuals were still scarce,
which made many of <hi>Mithridates</hi> Soldiers run into the Roman Army, and
though the King inflicted cruel punishment upon those, were surprised in
the attempt, throwing some headlong down the Rocks, squeezing out
others eyes, and burning some alive, so that fear kept many of them in
their duty; yet did his Army by little and little wast, by reason of the
scarcity. Which occasioned his sending Ambassadors to <hi>Pompey,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
upon what conditions he might have peace, to which the Roman
answered; <hi>by delivering up the Runaways and yielding himself at discretion.</hi>
The King having reported this answer to the Revolters, and seeing them
terrified at it, swore he never would have peace with the Romans, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their cruelty, Nor would consent to any thing but what should be
for the Common good of those had done him Service. Whereupon <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
having laid a party of Horse in Ambush, sent the rest to skirmish with
<hi>Mithridates</hi> Camp, with Orders to give ground after the first charge, as if
they had been surprised with fear, till such time as having drawn the Enemy
into the Ambush they charged them both together. And indeed the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
put them to the Rout, and might possibly have entred the Camp in
the Rear of those that fled, if <hi>Mithridates</hi> fearing the disorder had not
drawn out his Foot, and placed them in Order before the Camp which
forced them to a retreat. This was the first Engagement of Horse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two parties. At length the King oppressed for want of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
returned into the heart of his Kingdom, in hopes that the Enemy
could not subsist in that ruined Country, at least without much inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency.
But <hi>Pompey</hi> presently discamped, and bringing in provisions
along with him marched as far as the Eastern parts of the Kingdom where
he caused a Line to be drawn of<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>.</note> one hundred and fifty furlongs in length
fortified with many Forts, to inclose the King and cut of his passage to fetch
in Corn and Forrage. <hi>Mithridates</hi> gave no hindrance to this work, either
out of fear or out of imprudence which ordinarily precedes Calamity, and
soon found himself once more reduced to such want that he was forced to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65196:94"/>
kill all the beasts of burthen, to sustain his Army, keeping only the Horses
of Service. With infinite trouble he made a shift to subsist thus for fifty
days, and afterwards with great silence made his escape by night through
difficult ways. On the morrow <hi>Pompey</hi> overtaking him fell upon his Rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard,
but the King notwithstanding all the Counsel of Friends, would
not give Battel, but contenting himself to oppose the Romans, with some
Horse to keep him off, gained towards Evening, the Forrests which ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him for Retreat. The next day he possessed himself of a Village for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with Rocks on all sides, to which there was but one Avenue in
which he placed four Regiments for Guard, directly opposite to which the
Romans went and pitched their Camp, that so the King might have no
way to escape. On the morrow the two Armies betook themselves to
their Arms very early, and those which had the Guard on one Party and
the other, began the skirmish. Some of the Kings Horsemen alighting
from their Horses, without Command went to assist their Infantry, but
seeing a great party of the Roman Cavalry, come forward to the charge,
they all at once set a running towards the Camp to take their Horses, that
they might return to fight against the Romans on equal terms. But those
who were still above, and ready to descend in a posture of fighting, seeing
these People run with great cries and in disorder, and not knowing the
reason, believing that the Camp being taken on the other side, they fled;
themselves likewise threw down their Arms, and betook themselves to
flight, and because the way was narrow, the croud was so great, that they
overthrew, and tumbled one another down the Precipices. Thus the Army
of <hi>Mithridates</hi> was defeated by those who going to assist their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
without any Orders, occasioned the Rout. It was an easiy Victory
to <hi>Pompey,</hi> for he had nothing to do but to kill, or to take Prisoners those
unhappy disarmed wretches, engaged among the Rocks, there were about
ten thousand slain, the Camp was taken, and all <hi>Mithridates</hi> Baggage and
Munitions, who escaping himself behind his Camp accompanied only
with his Guards, found by chance some Mercenary Horse, and about three
thousand Foot, with whom with all speed he got to the Fort of <hi>Synorega</hi>
where he had abundance of Mony. And having given both a largess,
and a whole years Pay to the Companions of his flight, he carried with
him about six thousand talents, taking his way towards the springs of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi>
that from thence he might get to <hi>Colchis;</hi> he made such hast that
in four day march he passed the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> where he stayed three days to
refresh his Men, and Arm those other Troops he had gathered together,
he thence entred into the Country of <hi>Cotenea,</hi> which is a Province of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi>
where he defeated the Coteneans and Iberians who would have stopt
his passage, and from thence gained the River <hi>Aspara.</hi> Some say that the
Asiatick Iberians, are descended from the European, that is to say, the
Spaniards, others on the contrary, say the Spaniatds came from these
Asiatiques, others again, that there is nothing common between the one
and the other but the name, there not being the least conformity either in
their Language or Manners. Now <hi>Mithridates</hi> having taken up his Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
quarters at<note n="*" place="margin">A City of Colchis built by <hi>Castor</hi> and Pollux, who are said to be Sons of <hi>Jupiter, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuri</hi> in Greek signifying Son of <hi>Jupiter.</hi>

mean thoughts, nor that savored of the fugitive, he laid a design to march
along the banks of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, and by the Scythians, neighboring on
that Sea, and the <hi>Palus Moeotis,</hi> that so he might this way arrive at <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphorus,</hi>

and scarce credible <hi>Mithridates</hi> attempted to put them in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
he marched through all the Scythian Nations, whether Enemies or
unknown, partly by force and partly by sufferance: He was still both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
and feared, fugitive and miserable though he were. The Henio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians
willingly gave him passage, but the Acheans endeavoring to oppose
his march he forced it. It is said that these people being cast by Tempest
on the Coasts of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, as they returned from <hi>Troy,</hi> were ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Barbarians, because they were Greeks, and that having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
some Ships from the Cities of their Country and being refused
them, they conceived such an indignation or rather such a rage, that all the
Greeks they could catch they made Sacrifice off, at first, without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
sometime after chusing out the fairest, and at last drawing them
by lot. But let thus much suffice concerning the Scythian Achaeans. Now
<hi>Mithridates</hi> being entred into the Country bordering upon the <hi>Palus Maeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>
which is divided among many petty Kings, there was not one but out
of respect to the great reputation of his actions, and of his Kingdom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him favorably, and gave him passage through their Lands, they
likewise made him presents, and he ordered things so, that having drawn
them into alliance with him, and given some of his Daughters in Marriage to
the most powerful of them there entred into his thoughts a wonderful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.
He formed a design to March through <hi>Thrace</hi> and so through
<hi>Macedon,</hi> and thence by the way of <hi>Pannonia</hi> to pass the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and enter
into <hi>Italy. Machares</hi> his Son understanding that in so short a time he had
traversed all those Salvage Nations, and those which are called the Straits
of <hi>Scythia,</hi> where never Man before him had passed, sent Ambassadors to
make his excuse, that out of fear he had made an accommodation with the
Romans, but knowing him implacable, he fled towards the <hi>Pontique Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonesus,</hi>
after having burnt all the Ships he had to hinder his Father from
pursuing him, but his Father sending a Fleet after him he slew himself.
As for <hi>Pompey</hi> he pursued <hi>Mithridates</hi> as far as <hi>Colchis,</hi> but never imagining
that he would take the way we have spoken of, or that a fugitive Prince
would attempt any thing Great, he went through all that Province well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
to see the Country whither the Argonautes, and <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi>
had made their Voyage; and particularly the Rock, where they say <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus</hi>
was chained on Mount <hi>Caucasus.</hi> There are in this Mountain seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
springs, that cast forth Grains of Gold, but so small, that they are
scarce perceivable. Wherefore those of the Country, put into the streams
skins covered with wooll, by which means they get the golden sands,
which gather in the fleece. And possibly that famous golden fleece of
<hi>Aaete</hi> is nothing else. As <hi>Pompey</hi> passed through the Country to see these
rarities, all the neighboring Nations came to wait on him, and be his
Conductors. Only <hi>Oreses</hi> and <hi>Artocus</hi> Kings of the Albanians, and Ibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
laid an Ambush for him with seventy thousand men near the River
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> which discharges it self into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea by nine Navigable
Channels, and into which a Multitude of other Rivers loose themselves
among which the <hi>Araxes</hi> is the greatest of all. The Roman General ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
intelligence hereof caused a Bridge to be laid over the River, crossed it,
and drove the Barbarians into the Wood, from whence they being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
to fight sallying out as from a fortress, and when they were least
thought of renewing the charge, <hi>Pompey</hi> having placed People round
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:65196:95"/>
about the wood, set fire to it, and as they came forth gave them chase, till
such time as coming to give him presents and hostages, they served likewise
as matter for his Triumph. He found among the Hostages and Prisoners
many Women who had received no less wounds then the Men. They deemed
them to be Amazons, whether the Nation of the Amazons, who are not
far off, had sent assistance to those Kings, or whether the Barbarians by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
name call all Warlike Women Amazons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> returning after this Victory marched his Army into <hi>Armenia</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXV"/>
against <hi>Tigranes,</hi> as the Allie of <hi>Mithridates</hi> taking the way of <hi>Artaxata</hi>
the ordinary Residence of those Kings. But <hi>Tigranes</hi> was not for War.
He had had three Sons by <hi>Mithridates</hi> Daughter, two of which he had
slain with his own hand, one for turning his back in the fight, and the
other as he was hunting, because he happening to fall, his Son had not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
to help him up, but on the contrary had taken off his Diadem as he
lay upon the ground, and put it on his own head. As for his third Son <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes,</hi>
because he seemed grieved for his fathers fall, he gave him the
Crown, yet he soon after raised War against <hi>Tigranes,</hi> but being defeated
in a Battel escaped to <hi>Phraates</hi> King of the Parthians, who had newly
succeeded in that Kingdom to his Father <hi>Syntricus.</hi> Upon <hi>Pompey</hi>'s ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the Fugitive <hi>Armenian</hi> by the Advice of his Host; who for his own
particular sought the favor of the General, came and submitted himself
to the Romans in the posture of a Suppliant, though he were Grandchild
to <hi>Mithridates,</hi> being the Son of his Daughter, but the reputation of the
Justice, and uprightness of <hi>Pompey</hi> was so great among the Barbarians,
that <hi>Tigranes</hi> himself relying upon it, without so much as sending a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld
before came to meet him, to put his cause into his hands and to
complain of his Son as to a Judge. <hi>Pompey</hi> having sent some Officers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to receive the King in Honor of him, those who accompanied him
not thinking themselves in security, because he had not sent a Herauld be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
turned tail, but <hi>Tigranes</hi> continued on his way, and being come near
unto <hi>Pompey,</hi> paid him his respects as to his Superior, after the manner of
the Barbarians. Yet there are some say the Lictors brought him to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
by his Command. However it were, he came, gave an account of his
Actions, made a present to <hi>Pompey</hi> of six thousand Talents, fifty drams to
every Soldier, a thousand to every Centurion, and ten thousand to every
Tribune. <hi>Pompey</hi> pardoned what was past, reconciled the Son with the
Father, ordained that the Son should enjoy as King the Province of <hi>Sophena</hi>
and <hi>Gordiana,</hi> which are at this day comprised under the name of <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
the less, and adjudged to the Father the rest of <hi>Armenia,</hi> on condition
that he left it by succession to his Son, and that he quitted to the Romans
the Provinces he had conquered, and indeed he quitted all <hi>Syria,</hi> from the
<hi>Euphrates</hi> to the Sea, with part of <hi>Cilicia</hi> which he had possessed himself
of, after having driven out <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Pious. The two Kings were not
yet parted from the Roman Camp, when the Son by perswasion of those
Armenians, who for fear had abandoned his Father, when he came to
meet <hi>Pompey,</hi> designed an attempt on his life, but he was discovered and
Arrested, and being afterwards Convicted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that though Prisoner as he
was, he had solicited the Parthians to make War upon the Romans, he
was led in Triumph, and afterwards put to death in Prison. <hi>Pompey</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
the War was ended built a City in <hi>Armenia</hi> the less, in the same
place where he had overcome <hi>Mithridates,</hi> which because of his Victory
he called <hi>Nicopolis.</hi> He gave likewise the Kingdom of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> to <hi>Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barzanes</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:65196:96"/>
and joyned to it <hi>Sophena</hi> and <hi>Gordiana</hi> which he had before given
to the young <hi>Tigranes,</hi> and which at present belong to the Province of
<hi>Cappadocia.</hi> He gave him likewise <hi>Cabala</hi> a City of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and some
others, so that <hi>Ariobarzanes</hi> left to a Son that succeded him all that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
subject to many changes, till the time of <hi>Augustus Caesar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> under whose
Empire it was, with many others, reduced into the form of a Province.
<hi>Pompey</hi> after this passed Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> and went to make War upon <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus
Commagenes,</hi> to whom he afterwards granted Peace with the Title
of Friend to the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> he defeated likewise the <hi>Mede Darius,</hi>
because he had assisted <hi>Antiochus,</hi> or possibly <hi>Tigranes</hi> before him. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he led his Army against <hi>Areta</hi> King of the Arabian Nabathaean, and
at length against the <hi>Iews,</hi> who were revolted against their King <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus,</hi>
from whom he took by force their holy City <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> besides all
this he reduced under the Roman obedience without fighting, and as it
were only in passing by, the remainder of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> which yet acknowledged
not the Roman Empire, together with all the habitable <hi>Syria</hi> on this side
<hi>Euphrates, Coelosyria, Phoenicia, Palestine, Idumea, Ituria</hi> and all the
other members of <hi>Syria.</hi> Not that the Romans had any cause of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
against <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Pious, who was present at all this, endeavoring
to obtain the Kingdom of his Fathers by force of Prayers; but the Roman
General believed that having driven <hi>Tigranes</hi> out of these Provinces which
he had conquered, they by right of War belonged to the People of <hi>Rome.</hi>
As he was setling necessary Orders in his Conquests, there came to him
Ambassadors on the behalf of <hi>Phraates</hi> and <hi>Tigranes</hi> who began to make
War on each other. The <hi>Armenian</hi> demanded his assistance as his friend,
and the Parthians desired to be received into the friendship of the People
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and he unwilling to enter upon a War with the Parthians, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a particular Order of the Senate, sent Commissioners who made Peace
between the two Kings.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVI"/> Whilst he was employed in all these affairs, <hi>Mithridates</hi> had taken the
whole compass of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, and having siesed upon <hi>Panticapea</hi> a
Merchant City situate in <hi>Europe</hi> on the mouth of <hi>Pontus,</hi> very near the
Strait, he slew his Son <hi>Xiphares</hi> for a fault committed by his Mother, in
this manner. <hi>Mithridates</hi> had great quantity of Vessels of Brass bound
about with Iron, and filled with Silver, hid under ground in a certain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
the Guard of which he had entrusted to <hi>stratonice</hi> one of his Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines
or of his Wives. She only knew of it, and yet whilst the King
was making the Circuit of <hi>Pontus,</hi> she delivered to <hi>Pompey</hi> the Castle, and
all the Treasures, only on this condition, that if her Son <hi>Xiphares</hi> fell into
his power he should save his life in favor of his Mother, he took the Mony,
promised to preserve her Son, and permitted him to retire whither he
pleased with his Equipage. The King coming to know this, slew <hi>Xipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi>
on the Sea-side in the sight of his Mother, who stood on the other side
the Strait, and threw the body into the water, not permitting it burial, so
small account he made of paternal piety, that he might revenge himself
of the Mother, who had committed the fault. After this he sent Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
to <hi>Pompey</hi> who was in <hi>Syria,</hi> and knew not that he was yet living,
offering to pay Tribute to the Romans if he would leave him the Kingdom
of his Fathers, to which <hi>Pompey</hi> sending him word that he should come
and meet him as <hi>Tigranes</hi> had done, he answered that he could not do it,
for that it would be unbecoming the Person of <hi>Mithridates;</hi> yet offering
to send his Sons, and some of his Friends. Upon this answer he began to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65196:96"/>
make new Leavies of all Men of all sorts and conditions indifferently, to
cause to be made great quantity of Arms, Bows and Engins, without spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
any thing whatsoever, the very Oxen used to Labour, being killed
only for their Nerves, he imposed likewise new Tributes from which
the very poorest were not exempt, whilst those who had the charge of
Collecting them, committed a thousand Extortions unknown to <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates.</hi>
For he had got an Ulcer in his face, which so disfigured him that
he let no person see him but three Eunuchs that dressed him; being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
he found all his Forces in a condition to march being composed of
sixty Regiments of six hundred Men each, besides multitudes of all sorts of
People with quantity of Ships, and strong places which his Captains had
sieised upon during his distemper. He therefore passed over a part of his
Army to <hi>Phanagoria,</hi> another Merchant City situate on the other side of
the Strait, to the end he might on both sides be Master of the passage.
<hi>Pompey</hi> was still in <hi>Syria,</hi> but a certain Inhabitant of <hi>Phanagoria</hi> called <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,</hi>
whom <hi>Tryphon</hi> the Kings Eunuch had formerly put to the Torture,
killed the Eunuch as he entred, and began to cry out Liberty. The people
presently rose upon it, and though the Fortress was guarded by <hi>Artaphernes</hi>
and other Children of <hi>Mithridates;</hi> yet they brought Wood round about
it, and set it on fire, which so affrighted <hi>Artaphernes, Darius, Xerxes, Oxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thres</hi>
and <hi>Eupator</hi> the Kings Sons, that they yielded themselves. They
were all very beautiful, but they were all but Children, except only <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphernes,</hi>
who might be forty years old; there staid in the Fortress only
one of their Sisters called <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who would not go out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whose ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity
so much pleased the King that he sent Brigantines which brought
her off. All the Castles thereabouts, which <hi>Mithridates</hi> had lately sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
followed the Example of <hi>Phanagoria, Chersoneses, Theodozia.
Nymphaea,</hi> and other fortified Cities above in the Pontick Sea, did the like,
insomuch that the King seeing so many revolts, and not placing any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in the Fidelity of an Army, most of whom went to the War by
Constraint, besides the great Exactions he had made to bring this Army
on foot, and his own unfortunate condition, in which Estate a Prince can
have no reliance on the Faith of his Subjects, he sent some Eunuchs into
<hi>Scythia</hi> with his daughters to give them in Marriage to the Kings of that
Country, entreating them to come to his succour with all the Force they
had. He had appointed these Eunuchs a guard of five hundred Soldiers,
for the Conduct of these Princesses, but scarce had they lost sight of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
but they slew the Eunuchs, who by virtue of the power they had
over the Kings Spirit, had always tyrannized over them, and carried the
Ladies to <hi>Pompey.</hi> The King though he had lost so many Children, so
many strong places, nay indeed his whole Kingdom, nor had now any
hopes of aid from the Scythians, abated not at all the fierceness of his
courage, nor entertained any thoughts that were mean or suitable to his
present Calamity; He formed a design to march into <hi>Gaul</hi> and stir up that
people to Arms, with whom he had to that purpose before hand made a
league and entred into alliance, thinking with them to cross the <hi>Alps,</hi> and
fall upon <hi>Italy,</hi> where he had hopes many people would joyn with him, out
of the hate they bore the Romans; for he had heard tell how <hi>Hannibal</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Wars within <hi>Spain</hi> had laid the same design and succeeded, and after
so daring an attempt made himself formidable to his Enemies; besides he
had intelligence that almost all their allies in <hi>Italy</hi> were revolted against
them, out of a general hate, and had a long time bore Arms against
them, and likewise favored to their prejudice the Gladiator <hi>Spartacus</hi> a
vile fellow. Upon these hopes he was ready to take his march towards
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65196:97"/>
                  <hi>Gaul,</hi> if the Army terrifyed with such prodigious boldness, had not made
abortive these magnificent Designs. The Soldiers seeing he had a mind
to lead them so far off, to encounter people, they could not defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from, in their own Countrey, thought that <hi>Mithridates</hi> despairing
of his own Affairs, thought it more honourable to die generously like a
King, then to lie idle and do nothing. However they said nothing but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his orders without any murmuring, for this King was a man of no
mean Soul, nor despisable in the very midst of Calamity.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVII"/> Things being in this Estate, <hi>Pharnaces</hi> the most beloved of all his Sons
and whom he had often designed his Successor in the Kingdom, laid a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
against his life; whether it were that he thought this expedition might
prove prejudicial to his Affairs, and blast the hopes he yet had, the Romans
would grant him pardon, which he was sure they would absolutely refuse,
if his Father went to ravage <hi>Italy,</hi> or whether it were for other reasons, or
else out of an impatient desire to reign. His Complices being taken and
put to torture, <hi>Monophanes</hi> perswaded <hi>Mithridates</hi> that being ready to
march, it was not convenient to put to death a Son he had so tenderly loved,
that such disorders would happen during the War, and would end with
the War, insomuch that he suffered himself to yield and pardoned his Son.
But <hi>Pharnaces</hi> being affrighted with some private intelligence given him,
and knowing that the Army had an aversion for this Expedition, went by
night, and conferred with the Principal of the Roman Fugitives, whose
Tents were not far from the Kings, aggravating to them the danger they
ran into (which was not unknown to them) if they went into <hi>Italy;</hi> and
making them great Promises if they would stay with him, he prevailed
with them to forsake <hi>Mithridates.</hi> At the same time he sent some of his
people to the neighbouring Tents to make the same Proposition to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
who likewise gave him their word. Morning being come, the Runa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
began to shout all together, to which those who were encamped
next them, answered in the same tone, after them all the Army, even to
the very Fleet did the like. It's possible they were not all of the Conspiracy,
but those who were not engaged followed the others, out of a natural faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
men have to despise the miserable, and to affect Novelty. And some
too not knowing the number of the Conspirators, believed the whole Army
concerned, and believing themselves alone unable to resist such a Multitude,
shouted with the rest more for fear then good will. <hi>Mithridates</hi> wakened
by these cries, sent some to them to know what they desired, to whom
they returned answer, they demanded his Son for their King, a young man
for an old one, overswayed by his Eunuchs, and a Murderer of many of his
Children, Captains and Friends. Having heard this return, He came out
to speak to them, and in the mean time a Troop of his Guards going to
joyn with the Runa wayes, they told them they would not receive them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to gain belief amongst them, they would do some notable action, and
at the same time showed them the King. They then killed his Horse, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him dispose himself to flight, and then as if they had done what was
desired of them, called <hi>Pharnaces</hi> King, and some one having taken out of
a Temple a certain Band of Parchment tyed it about his head instead of a
Diadem; the Old man seeing all this from a high Gallery whither he had
escaped, sent several Messengers one after another, to his Son, to desire se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
for his retreat, but none returning, he was afraid lest they would
deliver him up to the Romans. Wherefore having given orders to his
Friends and those of his Guards, who had not yet forsaken him, to go and
submit themselves to the new King, after having extolled their fidelity, he
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65196:97"/>
took out some Poison which he alwaies carried hid in the Belt of his Sword,
and began to dissolve it, but two of his Daughters lately brought to him,
<hi>Mithridatis</hi> and <hi>Nissa,</hi> promised in marriage to the Kings of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi>
earnestly besought him to permit them to drink before him, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
him from taking it, till they had first swallowed it. The violence of the
Poison soon gave them their death, but on <hi>Mithridates,</hi> though he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up and down a great place on purpose to heat himself, the Poyson
had no effect, because of the Preservative he had used dayly to take for
fear of being poisoned, which to this day is called <hi>Mithridate,</hi> seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
near him a certain Captain of the Gauls, called <hi>Bituitus. Your hand</hi>
(said he) <hi>has done me many excellent Services in War, but the most excellent
of all would be to kill me now, lest I should be led in Triumph, after having
so long reigned in so great a Kingdom. I cannot die by Poyson, because I have
been too cautious against it, insensible that I was to have taken so much care of
what I eat, and not to foresee that cruel and domestick Venome to all Kings,
the Treason of my Children, my Friends and my Armies. Bituitus</hi> moved with
this discourse performed for the King this last Office he desired of him.
Thus dyed the sixteenth Descendant from <hi>Darius</hi> the last King of the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and the eighth Successor to that <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who shaking of the
Macedonian Yoak, made himself King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> the sixty eighth or sixty
ninth Year of his Age, and the fifty seventh of his Reign, for he was but
an Infant when he took Possession of the Kingdom. He subdued all the
neighbouring Barbarians, and a great part of <hi>Scythia,</hi> he maintained War
against the Romans forty Years space, during which he several times made
himself Master of <hi>Bithynia</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> made several Inroads into <hi>Asia,
Phrygia, Paphlagonis, Galatia, Macedon,</hi> besides many memorable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in <hi>Greece.</hi> He had likewise the Empire of the Sea from <hi>Cilicia</hi> as far as
<hi>Ionia,</hi> but he quitted it when <hi>Sylla</hi> forced him to confine himself with the
Bounds of the Kingdom of his Father, after the loss of one hundred
and sixty thousand men. Yet after that mighty loss, he forbore not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the War, and did it without much difficulty, having besides always
had to do with great Captains. 'Tis true that <hi>Sylla, Lucullus</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercame
him, but he had likewise the advantage ore them in many Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and withal he took Prisoners <hi>L. Cassius, Q. Oppius</hi> and <hi>Manius Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
carrying them about Captives with him, till he put one of them to
death, as the Principal Author of the War, and delivered up the others to
<hi>Sylla.</hi> He defeated likewise <hi>Fimbria, Murena, Cotta</hi> Proconful, <hi>Fabius</hi> and
<hi>Triarius.</hi> He appeared always great, always constant, even in the midst
of Calamities, and vanquished though he were, omitted nothing that might
be attempted against the Romans, even to the allying himself with the
<hi>Maeotiques</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> sending Ambassadors to <hi>Sertorius</hi> into <hi>Spain.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all the wounds he received from Enemies or from Traytors,
he never gave himself any rest, no not in his Age, nor ever was there any
conspiracy against him, but was discovered, save only the last, and possibly
he now perished for suffering himself willingly to be deceived; so ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
is the malice of those to whom we grant pardon. He was yet so cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
and bloody that he slew his Mother, his Brother, three of his Sons and
as many Daughters, he was of great Stature, as his Arms sent to <hi>Delphos,</hi>
and <hi>Nemaea</hi> make appear, and so strong that even to his last end, he was one
of the lustiest Horsemen and most vigorous thrower of a Javelin in his
whole Kingdom, he had travelled in one day a<note n="*" place="margin">One hundred twenty and five Miles.</note> thousand Furlongs drawn
by a Chariot with eight Horses, and having fresh ones led. He had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the Greek Tongue, and was well instructed in the Ceremonies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65196:98"/>
of the <hi>Greeks.</hi> He was likewise a lover of Musick, was patient in
labour, sober in diet, but intemperate in the love of Women. Such was
the end of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> surnamed <hi>Eupator Dyonsiuis,</hi> whose death delivered
the Romans from a troublesome War, which they testifyed by their joy
when they heard the News.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Pharnaces</hi> sent to <hi>Pompey</hi> to <hi>Sinope Mithridates</hi> body in a Galley, and
with it those who had arrested <hi>Manius,</hi> with a great number of Hostages,
as well <hi>Greeks</hi> as Barbarians, supplicating him to continue him in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of his Father, or at least in that of <hi>Bosphorus</hi> which <hi>Mithridates</hi> had
given to his Brother <hi>Machares. Pompey</hi> delivered the Kings body to those
that brought it to be Royally interred and would himself be at the expence,
giving orders it should be laid in the usual Sepulcre of the Kings at <hi>Sinope,</hi>
praysing him as the greatest King of his time, and who had done the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest
actions. As for <hi>Pharnaces</hi> in acknowledgement of his having freed
<hi>Italy</hi> from many difficulties, he gave him the Kingdom of <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
only <hi>Phanagoria</hi> whose Citizens he would have remain free, because
they first forsaking <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who again levied Forces, and had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
a Fleet and Army, and strong places of retreat, had put a stop to him,
and by the Example they had given others, been the cause of his death;
As for <hi>Pompey</hi> himself having in this War alone cleared the Sea of Pyrates,
overcome the greatest of Kings, waged War succesfully (besides the
<hi>Pontick</hi> Nations) with the Colches, Albanians, Iberians, Armenians,
Medes, Arabs, Jews, and all other Oriental People, he extended the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire from the East as far as <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whither he would not go,
though <hi>Ptolemy</hi> called him to his assistance against his seditious people, and
to that end sent him Presents of Silver, and Cloths for all his Army, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he feared to give occasion of envy to his Enemies, by attempting
what the Oracle had forbid, or for other reasons, we shall specify when we
come to treat of the affairs of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> As for what concerns the Nations
which he had subdued, he gave some their liberty, because they had sent
him Succors, others he reduced into the form of a Province, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
gave Kings. To <hi>Tigranes Armenia,</hi> to <hi>Pharnaces Bosphorus,</hi> to <hi>Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barzanes

the Title of Friend of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in short gratifyed a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of other Persons with Governments, and likewise with great Sums of
Money. He built also Cities, <hi>Nicopolis</hi> in <hi>Armenia</hi> the less, as a Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Victory. <hi>Eupatoria</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Pontus,</hi> which <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates
Eupator</hi> had called by his name, when he founded it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
had rased it for opening its Gates to the Romans, which <hi>Pompey</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
rebuilding from the ground called <hi>Magnopolis.</hi> He reedifyed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>Mazaca,</hi> a Citie of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> which had been demolished during the
War, and repaired divers others which were ruined or decaying in divers
places of <hi>Pontus, Palestine</hi> the lower, <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> in which last is scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
that City formerly called <hi>Soly,</hi> and at present <hi>Pompeiopolis,</hi> which he
peopled for the most part with Pyrates. He found in the City of <hi>Talauris</hi>
where <hi>Mithridates</hi> Magazines were, two thousand Vessels of<note n="*" place="margin">A certain kind of Marble.</note> 
                  <hi>Onichit is</hi>

bound about with Gold, quantity of Flagons, Cups,<note n="*" place="margin">Or beds, for they then eat on beds.</note> Tables, and Seats,
all perfectly beautiful. There were likewise such vast numbers of Bridles
and Saddles, enriched with Gold and precious Stons, that the Questor was
thirty daies in receiving and counting them. One part of these precious
moveables came to <hi>Mithridates</hi> by succession from <hi>Darius</hi> the Son of <hi>Hista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spes</hi>
having passed from hand to hand, to the several Successors of the Kings
of <hi>Persia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> unto him; <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had taken another part out of the Treasures
of the <hi>Ptolemies,</hi> and given them in keeping to the Inhabitants of the Isle
of <hi>Coos,</hi> from whence <hi>Mithridates</hi> had brought them, and the rest that
King had bought and stored together himself, being very curious of rich
moveables. Towards the end of Winter <hi>Pompey</hi> distributed rewards to
his Victorious Soldiers, fifteen hundred <hi>Attick</hi> Drams to every Soldier. And
to the Tribunes and Centurions proportionably, so that it is said the whole
Sum of this distribution amounted to sixteen thousand Talents. After this
he went from <hi>Ephesus</hi> to <hi>Italy</hi> by Sea, and dismissing his Army at <hi>Brundusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
returned to <hi>Rome.</hi> And by this popular action, astonished the Romans
as if they had seen a Miracle. The whole City went forth to meet him,
the youngest a great way, and others according to their Age; and after
all came the Senate themselves admiring the prodigious greatness of the
actions he had done. For never before him had any person defeated so
powerful an Enemy, nor added so many Provinces to the Roman Empire,
or extended their Dominion to the <hi>Euphrates.</hi> And in like manner he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
in Triumph in in a more Magnificent manner then ever any had done
before in the five and thirtieth year of his age. The Pomp lasted two days,
for it required a great deal of time for the passing by of so many different
People, Ponticks, Armenians, Cappadocians, Cilicians, the several Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of all <hi>Syria,</hi> Albanians, Heniochians, Acheans, Scythians, and Ibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.
He brought likewise into the Ports seven hundred Ships compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fitted, and sent into the City Chariots laden with Gold, and Rarities of
inestimable price, among which was the<note n="*" place="margin">Or beds, for they then eat on beds.</note> Table of <hi>Darius</hi> the Son of <hi>His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taspes,</hi>
the Chair and Scepter of <hi>Eupator,</hi> with his Figure of Massie Gold
eight foot high, and yet was only the Breast and Head, and seven hundred
thousand five hundred and ten Talents of Silver Money. There were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
a great number of Waggons laden with Arms, and some with Ship
Beaks. After followed a multitude of Captives and Pyrates, chained and
habited every one according to the fashion of his Country, before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphal
Chariot marched the Satrapes, Captains, and Sons of Kings, some
Captives, others Hostages, to the number of four hundred twenty four.
Among whom was <hi>Tigranes</hi> the Son of <hi>Tigranes,</hi> five Sons of <hi>Mithridates,
Artaphernes, Cyrus, Oxathres, Darius</hi> and <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and two Daughters <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sabaris</hi>
and <hi>Eupatra,</hi> and among the rest <hi>Olthalces,</hi> and <hi>Aristobulus</hi> King of
<hi>Colchis</hi> and the Jews, the Tyrants of <hi>Cilicia</hi> and the Queens of <hi>Scythia.</hi>
Three <hi>Iberian</hi> Generals, two of the <hi>Albanians,</hi> with <hi>Menander</hi> of <hi>Laodicea</hi>

besieged, his secret flight by night, his death and with him his two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
companions of his misfortune, there were shown likewise the Pictures
of his Children of both Sexes that dyed before him, and the Figures of the
Gods adored by the Barbarians adorned after the manner of their Country,
and neer to them a fair Table with this Inscription. Ships of War taken,
eight hundred; Cities built in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> eight; in <hi>Cilicia</hi> and <hi>Caelosyria,</hi>
twenty; in <hi>Palestine Seleucia.</hi> Kings overcome, <hi>Tigranes</hi> of <hi>Armenia, Arto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of <hi>Iberia, Oreses</hi> of <hi>Abania, Darius</hi> of the Medes. <hi>Areta</hi> of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathaeans,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65196:99"/>
and <hi>Antiochus Commagenes.</hi> Then appeared <hi>Pompey</hi> on a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
all glittering with precious Stones, clad (as some say) in the Coat of
<hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> but if that may be believed, 'tis likely it was found
among <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s Movables, which the Inhabitants of the Isle of <hi>Coos</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
to <hi>Mithridates.</hi> At last after the Chariot marched the Officers of
the Army who had served him in this expedition some on Horseback others
on foot, who all together conducted their General to the Capitol. When
he was arrived there, he put not to death any of the Captives, as all who
triumphed before him had done, but sent them back into their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
at the publique charge, except only the Kings and Kings Children, of
whom he not long after put to death <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> and after him <hi>Tigranes.</hi>
As for <hi>Pharnaces</hi> he in the mean time kept the Inhabitants of <hi>Phanagoria</hi>
blockt up, till such time as Famine made them resolve to give him Battel,
however the King granted their pardon, and without injuring any of them
was content to take Hostages. Sometime after he took <hi>Sinope,</hi> and desirous
to make himself Master of <hi>Amisa,</hi> he made War upon <hi>Calvisius,</hi> who then
Commanded the Roman Forces in the Country, in the time that <hi>Caesar</hi> and
<hi>Pompey</hi> were engaged against each other, and at last the Romans being else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
busied he was driven out of <hi>Asia</hi> by <hi>Asander</hi> upon a particular Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel.
He had likewise to do with <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> as he returned from <hi>Aegypt</hi>
after the Rout of <hi>Pompey</hi> (which happened about that Mount where his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had beaten <hi>Triarius)</hi> and being beaten escaped to <hi>Sinope,</hi> with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horse, whither <hi>Caesar</hi> wanting leasure to follow him, sent <hi>Domitius</hi> to
whom he yielded the City, who after he was come out with his Cavalry ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Articles of Peace, agreed between them, caused all the
Horses to be killed, which did not well please the Horsmen, with whom
Shipping himself he retired by Sea to the Kingdom of <hi>Pontus.</hi> As soon as
he came there he assembled a great number of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ythians, and Sarmatians
and made himself Master of <hi>Theodotia</hi> and <hi>Panticapea,</hi> but <hi>Asander</hi> renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the War with him, his Horsemen being dismounted and not used to fight
on foot, were beaten, and <hi>Pharnaces</hi> showing himself the only man of Valour
was slain, after having received many wounds, the fiftieth year of his Age,
and fifteenth of his Reign in <hi>Bosphorus. C. Caesar</hi> gave his Kingdom to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi>
of <hi>Pergamus</hi> who had served him well in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but at this day
all those people are free, and there are yearly Praetors sent into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Bithynia, Caesar</hi> confirmed all those who had received
favours from <hi>Pompey</hi> in the Estates and Governments he had given them,
though he complained they had taken part with their Benefactor to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
save only the priest-hood of <hi>Commanes,</hi> which he took from <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelaus</hi>
to give to <hi>Nicomedes.</hi> But some time after not only these Estates,
but also all that <hi>C. Caesar</hi> and <hi>M. Anthony</hi> had given to others, were reuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Roman Empire, after that <hi>Augustus</hi> became Master of <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
for the Romans let slip no opportunity to enlarge their Empire. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

the sandy Desarts of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and from the Pillars of <hi>Hercules,</hi> which are

that <hi>Polyphemus</hi> the <hi>Cyclops</hi> had three Sons by <hi>Galatea; Celtus, Illyrius</hi>
and <hi>Gallus,</hi> who going out of <hi>Sicily</hi> gave their Names to the<note n="*" place="margin">Gauls.</note> Celtes,
Illyrians and Galatians, of which Nation they made themselves Kings; and
indeed this opinion seems to me the most probable of all. They say like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
that <hi>Illyrius</hi> had sons <hi>Achilles, Autarius, Dardanus, Medus, Taulantius</hi>
and <hi>Perhebius,</hi> and Daughters <hi>Partha, Daorta, Dazera</hi> and others, from

<hi>Paeonius</hi> and <hi>Scordiscus,</hi> from which <hi>Paeonius</hi> came <hi>Triballius,</hi> who all
three gave their names to three Nations as we learn in Ancient Records.
<hi>Illyria</hi> therefore (as we find to this day by several Publick Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
in that great Countrey) was formerly possessed by the
Scordisks and Triballians, who continually made War, till such time as
those that remained of the Triballians went away to the Getes above the
<hi>Ister.</hi> And this Nation which to the time of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> had a
great reputation is at this day so utterly decayed that there scarce remains to
us the memory of its name. The Scordicks are likewise much weakned,
for being subdued by the Romans they retreated within the Isles of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Ister.</hi> However sometime after a party returned and inhabited a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Paeonia.</hi> Wherefore the Scordisks are to this day reckoned among
the Paeonians. The Autarians who likewise possessed a good tract on the
Sea Coast, were likewise driven out by the Ardians. After that the

                  </note> Liburnians who were esteemed excellent Seamen, came and setled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a part of <hi>Illyria,</hi> from whence they scoured all the <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea,
plundring all the Ships they met with, and because they had Ships very

<hi>Liburnicks.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>'Tis said that <hi>Apollo</hi>'s anger was the cause of the utter destruction of
the Autarians, and that they going with those <hi>Celtes</hi> that are called Cim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brians
to besiege the City of <hi>Delphos,</hi> were forthwith defeated and took
their flight in disorder, some of them not staying till the battel began, by
reason of the Rain, Tempest and Thunder which terrified them. Those
who returned found their whole Country covered with infinite multitudes
of Frogs who stinking poisoned the Rivers with their putrefaction, and
that at last the Earth casting forth Malignant Vapors, bred a cruel Plague
in <hi>Illyria.</hi> This Malady siesed chiefly on the Autarians, who leaving their
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:65196:100"/>
Country carried the Contagion along with them, so that no person durst
receive them, after three and twenty days travel they stopt in a marshy
and unhabited Country, and built Cities on the Confines of the Basternes.
As for the Celtes <hi>Apollo</hi> sent into their Country such Earthquakes as swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up whole Cities at once, and that this Calamity ceased not till they
as well as the others had quitted their habitations and come into <hi>Illyria,</hi>
where finding the Associates of their crime extreamly weakned by the
Plague, which had swept away the greatest part of them, they easily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
them, but the Contagion siesing likewise upon them by their touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of infected Cloths, they departed thence, and for change of air went as
far as the Pyrenaeans. Afterwards taking their way towards the East, the
Romans who were fearful lest the Celtes with whom they had several
times been engaged should once more pass the <hi>Alps</hi> and fall into <hi>Italy,</hi> sent
against them their Consuls, who were defeated, with their whole Army.
This defeat of the Consuls, and the dreadful name of the Celtes struck a
terror throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> till such time as having chosen <hi>Marius</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
who had lately gained a great Victory against the Lybians, Numidians
and Marusians, they overcame the Cimbrians, and afterwards had the
better of them in several Engagements (as we have set down in the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
of the Roman Wars against the Gauls.) So that weakned by such vast
effusion of blood, and grown hopeless of settling themselves in any other
place, they again recovered their Ancient Seat after having done much
mischief, and suffered innumerable losses. And here ended <hi>Apollo</hi>'s pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of the impiety of the Illyrians and Celtes. Yet this deterred
them not from afterwards committing other Sacriledges, for at another
time part of those two<note n="*" place="margin">Illyrians <hi>and</hi> Celtes.</note> Nations, and especially the Scordisks, Medes
and Dardanians made inroads into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and likewise into <hi>Greece,</hi>
robbing many Temples and assaulting that of <hi>Delphos,</hi> where they again
lost a great Number of their People. Two and thirty years after the first
Battel between the Romans and the Celtes, during which they had seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Engagements, the Romans who had already conquered <hi>Greece</hi> and
<hi>Macedon,</hi> declared War against them for the like Sacriledge, and gave
<hi>L. Scipio</hi> the Command of their Armies. The Fame has reached even to
our times that their Neighbors were the Companions of their Impiety, but
remembring the punishment of the Autarians of whom not one was left
alive in <hi>Illyria,</hi> left them to <hi>Scipio</hi>'s mercy without giving them any
assistance. And that <hi>Scipio</hi> having cut in pieces all the Scordisks, except
a small Number who saved themselves on the other side of <hi>Ister,</hi> and on
the Isles of that River, suffered himself to be bribed with the Sacred
Gold, and for it made an Alliance with the Medes and Dardanians, which
gave occasion to some Historians of <hi>Italy,</hi> to write that this corruption
was the cause of all the Civil Wars, wherewith the Romans were tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
from <hi>Scipio</hi>'s time till the Establishing of the Monarchy. These
were the Greeks opinions of the Illyrians, on which I was willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
my self. As for the Romans they reckon with them not only the
People we have spoken of but likewise the<note n="*" place="margin">Austria <hi>and</hi> Hungaria.</note> Paeonians which are beyond
them, and the Rhetians, the Naricks, and the<note n="*" place="margin">The Northern <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
                  </note> Mysians which inhabit in
<hi>Europe;</hi> and also all the Neighboring People which lie on the right hand
of <hi>Ister,</hi> whom they distinguish (as the Hellens and the Greeks) by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Names, but in General call them all Illyrians: This opinion
which they have held from the beginning, and persist in it till our times,
hath been the cause that they have not yet found out the limits of those
Nations, and that they set the bounds of <hi>Illyria</hi> from the Springs of <hi>Ister</hi>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:65196:101"/>
far as the people upon the <hi>Pontick</hi> Sea, where they levy Tribute. I know
not well in what manner the Romans subdued them. So in writing the
affairs of <hi>Gaul</hi> I have declared that I could not gain a sufficient and ample
knowledge of the beginnings and occasions of these Wars; wherefore I
have exhorted those who had the better knowledge of the Affairs of <hi>Illyria</hi>
to write the History of them. In the mean time I shall present the publick
with such things as are come to my knowledge.</p>

                  <hi>Agron,</hi> King of that part of <hi>Illyria</hi> situate on the Gulf of the <hi>Ionian</hi>
Sea, once possessed by <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> and his Successors, became likewise Master
of a Corner of <hi>Epyrus,</hi> and with that of <hi>Corcyra, Epidamnum,</hi> and <hi>Pharos,</hi>
under pretence of protecting them. And being at Sea to sieze upon the
rest of <hi>Ionia,</hi> a certain Island called <hi>Issa,</hi> revolted from him, to submit to
the Romans, and at the same time sent Deputies to <hi>Rome</hi> to complain of
the oppressions they had suffered under <hi>Agron.</hi> As they returned they
were assaulted by the Illyrians, who slew their Deputy called <hi>Calemporus,</hi>
and a Roman Commissary, who according to the opinion of some was
<hi>Carnicanus,</hi> which struck such despair into the rest of their Company that
they all slew themselves. The Romans (as it said) took this occasion to
declare War against the Illyrians, and assaulted the Illyrians both by Sea
and Land. Mean while <hi>Agron</hi> died leaving only a Son; yet under age
called <hi>Pina,</hi> and to oblige his Wife to take care of the Child though she
were not his Mother, left her Regent of the Kingdom. <hi>Demetrius</hi> to whom
<hi>Agron</hi> had given the Government of <hi>Pharos</hi> having likewise siezed upon

                  <hi>Corcyra</hi> delivered both to the Romans, who then kept the Sea with a

                  <hi>Epidamnum</hi> to their party, and the Issians
and Epidamnians being besieged by the Illyrians, they sent an Army to
their relief who made the Illyrian forces raise their sieges and return home,
but some of them called the Atintanes, went and submitted to the Romans.
This occasioned <hi>Agrons</hi> Wife to send Ambassadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> restoring the
Captives and Fugitives, and demanding pardon, by remonstrating that
what was past, ought to be imputed to <hi>Agron</hi> and not to her, to which the
Senate answered, that <hi>Corcyra, Pharos, Issa,</hi> and <hi>Epidamnum,</hi> as also those
Illyrians called Atintanes, belonged now to the Roman Empire. That
they would leave to <hi>Pina</hi> all the remainder of that Country possessed by
his Father, and receive him into the Alliance of the Roman People, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
he medled not with any of the rest, nor suffered the Illyrians to sail
to the Island of <hi>Issa,</hi> save only with two boats unarmed. These conditions
the Ambassadors accepted, and this was the first War, and the first Peace
between the Romans and those of <hi>Illyria.</hi>

they had made Peace with the Celtes, set out a Fleet to Sea, and took the

As for <hi>Demetrius</hi> he at first escaping to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
retreating into the Country, and committing Pyracies on the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65196:101"/>
Ionian Sea's with some few Ships, they slew him at last, and utterly ruined
<hi>Pharos</hi> his Country as an Abettor of his mischiefs. But for the Illyrians
they pardoned them for <hi>Pina</hi>'s sake, who had kindly received them.
This was the second War and second Peace with the Illyrians. Now in
the pursuit of this History I shall neither respect time nor order, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
my self to write the affairs of every particular Illyrian Nation, as far
as I have learnt them. The Romans having sent their Armies into <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
against <hi>Perseus,</hi> who then possessed that Kingdom by succession from
<hi>Philip, Genthius</hi> another King of <hi>Illyria,</hi> prevailed with by the Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
Money entred into an Alliance with him, and engaged himself in
this War. He forthwith stirred up the Illyrians against the Romans, and
laid in Irons those Ambassadors they sent, under pretence they were not
come within his Lands as Ambassadors but as Spies. Wherefore <hi>Anitius</hi>
the Roman Praetor being then at Sea, took some of that Kings Ships, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
Landing in his Country, defeated him and afterwards so closely
besieged in a place that he only asked for quarter. Upon which the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
returning answer that he could grant him no other terms then surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
at discretion, he desired three days to consider of it, which being
granted, and the mean while finding that his Subjects ran away to <hi>Anitius,</hi>
he only desired security to come to him himself. When he came before
him he fell upon his knees, and with abasance insupportable in a man of
courage besought the Roman to grant him his life. <hi>Anitius</hi> seeing him
tremble, bid him take courage, raised him up with his own hand, and
made him eat at his Table, but when Dinner was done, gave Order to his
Officers to keep him Prisoner, and afterwards led him and his Son in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
to <hi>Rome.</hi> The War with <hi>Genthius</hi> was ended in twenty days, after
which, <hi>Aemulius Paulus</hi> pillaged seventy Cities in this manner. After ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
defeated King <hi>Perseus,</hi> whom he sent to the Senate going himself
privately to <hi>Rome,</hi> and returning with all speed, he caused it to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
in the name of the Senate, throughout all the Cities, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
pardon for all the faults yet committed, on condition they brought
in what Gold and Silver they had, which being agreed to, he sent his Army
divided into so many parties, into every City, and gave Order to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
to cause it to be proclaimed upon the break of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
day, that every Burgess should within three hours, bring
his Mony into the Publick place, which being performed he gave
up the rest of the City to plunder. Thus <hi>Paulus</hi> despoiled seventy Cities
of all their goods.</p>
               <p>Another time the Ardians, and another of the Neighboring Nations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
called the Palarians, being entred in hostile manner into the Lands pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
by the Romans in <hi>Illyria,</hi> because they were busied elsewhere, they
sent Ambassadors to forbid them to pass any farther, whom when they
would not obey they took a resolution to send an Army of ten thousand
Foot, and six hundred Horse. The Illyrians who were yet scarce suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
prepared for such a War, dispatched to <hi>Rome,</hi> and as if they had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
repented of what they had done, demanded Pardon. Upon
which the Senate condemned them to pay to them that they had oppressed,
the full value of the damage they had sustained, but when yet they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
not this Decree, <hi>Flaccus</hi> was sent with a powerful Army. Yet
all this exploits amounted to no more then some Inrodes and Skirmishes, for
he could not so suddenly end this War. I find likewise in History, that
<hi>Sempronius</hi> surnamed <hi>Tuditamus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius Pandusius</hi> defeated the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65196:102"/>
Japodes which inhabit the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and that they submitted to both at a time,
in the same manner, as the Sagistains yielded to <hi>L. Cotta</hi> and to <hi>Metellus.</hi>
As for the Dalmatians who are likewise a Nation of <hi>Illyria,</hi> but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, it is certain that they made War upon the Illyrians, subject to
the Romans, and that they would not receive the Deputies that came from
<hi>Rome</hi> to confer about this Affair. Wherefore there is some likely<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hood that
the Romans sent Forces against them. They dispatched (say some) an Army
Commanded by <hi>Marcus Figulus</hi> then Consul, but as soon as he was entred
the Country they fell upon his Vanguard, put the whole Army to a rout,
and pursued them as far as the River <hi>Naro,</hi> from whence they returned home
because of the approaching Winter. Then <hi>Figulus</hi> judging he might sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
them as they retired in disorder, followed them in the Rear, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
and pursued them as far as the City of <hi>Dalminium</hi> which gives
Name to the Dalmatians, and that not being able to take this City, so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was it fortifyed, by assault, nor to make use of any Engines by reason of
the vast height of the Wall, and besides wanting many things and not being
secure because of the frequent Sallies made by the Besieged, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to another Artifice: He took Stakes two foot long and wrapping
them about with Tow dipt in Pitch and Brimstone, and setting them on
fire, shot them from his Engines into the Town, the violence wherewith
they were darted, making them burn more vehemently, they flew through
the Air like so many flaming Torches, setting on fire all that they fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in somuch that the greatest part of the City being burnt, <hi>Figulus</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Rome</hi> Victorious. Some time after <hi>Cecilius Metellus</hi> having obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Consulate, went by Decree of the Senate to make War upon the
Dalmatians, who had given no occasion, but he had only set this design on
Foot, out of a desire to Triumph. But those people receiving him as a
Friend, he spent the Winter at <hi>Salone</hi> one of their Cities, and at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Rome</hi> in Triumph, though he had done nothing to deserve it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> Afterwards <hi>Caesar</hi> marching against the <hi>Gauls</hi> who lay not far distant
from <hi>Illyria,</hi> found that the Dalmatians with other people of <hi>Illyria</hi> had some
advantage over the Liburnians, another Nation of the same Country, and
took from them the City of <hi>Promona,</hi> wherefore the Liburnians submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themselves to the Romans, fled towards <hi>Caesar,</hi> then not far off, and
<hi>Caesar</hi> sent to those who had taken <hi>Promona,</hi> to exhort them to restore it, but
they having no respect to this advertisement he sent a great Army which
being defeated by the Illyrians, <hi>Caesar</hi> diverted by other Affairs, for <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s
Party was now forming, and he who saw it of necessity to come to
Arms with him, would attempt nothing more at that time against them:
But though the Season was troublesome and inconvenient, passed from <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusium</hi> into <hi>Ionia,</hi> with the greatest part of his Army to go thence into <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia</hi>
to War with <hi>Pompey,</hi> leaving <hi>Anthony</hi> to bring the remainder. But
afterwards <hi>Gabinius</hi> having likewise fifteen Cohorts and three thousand
Horse to carry to him, attempted to go through <hi>Illyria,</hi> at which the Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
being allarm'd because of those things lately happened, and judging that
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s Victory would be their Ruine, slew them all; except only <hi>Gabinius</hi>
and some Horsemen of his Guard, who escaped with him, gaining by this
defeat vast Spoils and Treasure. The Importance of this War wherein <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
was engaged with <hi>Pompey,</hi> obliged him at present to dissemble this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front.
But after that <hi>Pompey</hi> was defeated, and that <hi>Caesar</hi> had pursued the
remains of his Party into divers places, and setled all things in good order
and returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> he made preparations for an expedition he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:65196:102"/>
against the Getes and Parthians. Whereupon the Illyrians fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
lest <hi>Caesar</hi> in his way should revenge himself of the injury he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
sent Deputies to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ask pardon for what they had done, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>Caesar</hi> their allyance and Friendship, which might be of great concern
to him in his expedition against the Parthians, because of the valour of
the Illyrians, the reputation of which was spread through the whole Earth,
but he answered them very sharply that he would not entertain any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
or friendship with people had so highly offended him, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he was content to pardon them if they submitted to pay Tribute, and
deliver up Hostages. After they had promised both the one and the other,
he sent <hi>Atinius</hi> with three Legions to impose some small Tribute, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the promised Hostages. But <hi>Caesar</hi> being in the mean time murdered,
they thought the Roman Power must by his death, that was its chief sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
fall to ruine, wherefore they would no more obey <hi>Atinius</hi>'s orders
nor either pay Tribute, or deliver up Hostages, and as he wasted the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
with five Cohorts, they surprized them, put them to rout, and slew
<hi>Bebius</hi> who commanded the Party, and <hi>Atinius</hi> himself escaped hardly to
<hi>Epidamnum,</hi> with his scattered Forces. After which the Senate gave
that Army with all <hi>Macedon</hi> and <hi>Illyria,</hi> of which he was Governour, to
<hi>Marcus Brutus</hi> who slew <hi>Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Cassius</hi> an associate in that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
action, so that during the War they maintained against <hi>Anthony</hi>
and <hi>Caesar</hi> surnamed <hi>Augustus,</hi> the Illyrians enjoyed not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>As for the Peonians they are a great Nation inhabiting along the<note n="*" place="margin">Danube<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and extending themselves from the Japodes to the Dardanians. The Greeks
call them Peonians, but the Romans name them<note n="*" place="margin">Huns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> Pannonians, and reckon
them among the people of <hi>Illyria.</hi> Wherefore being writing the History
of <hi>Illyria,</hi> I think it now very apposite to speak of their Affairs. They
were already grown famous by the mighty actions done by the Agrians
under <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> for the Agrians were Peonians, and inhabited
the lower part of <hi>Peonia,</hi> but after they had so shamefully driven back
<hi>Cornelius,</hi> who came with an Army to make War upon them, the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
reputation of the Peonians filled all <hi>Italy</hi> with fear, and for a long time
there was not any Roman Consul found so brave as to attack them. And
this is all I can find, great or memorable, concerning the Peonians and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyrians,
in any History after diligent search made, nor have in perusal of
the Commentaries of <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> seen any thing of more Antiquity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>Peonian</hi> Nation. Indeed I find there was a certain other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Illyria,</hi> besides those by me mentioned that paid obedience to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
but I can neither tell where it is scituate or how it is called, for <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
writ not the Actions of others, but those properly his own. In what
manner he made the revolted Nations pay Tribute, subdued those that
were independent, and at last by force of Arms brought under subjection
those warlike people, who dwelling on the the tops of the <hi>Alps,</hi> because of
their bordering upon <hi>Italy,</hi> committed often Robberies, and made frequent
inroads. And really it somewhat amazes me, that so many Roman Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
having passed the <hi>Alpes,</hi> to make War in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> should
take no notice of these people; and that <hi>Caesar</hi> himself, who was so succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in War, and who for almost ten years together wintred about this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
whilst he was reducing the <hi>Gauls,</hi> should make so small account of those
that lay behind him. But I believe these Generals principally intent upon
those places, whither they were designed, thought no farther then of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65196:103"/>
the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and that <hi>Caesar</hi> whilst he was lodged on the Frontiers of <hi>Gaul,</hi>
applyed himself wholly to the ruine of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Party, who would have
made his Conquests his own; besides 'tis probable that when he took the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Illyria</hi> and the <hi>Gauls;</hi> it was meant only of what depended on
the Romans. But <hi>Augustus</hi> at last made himself Master of all. Though
not without great labour; for he that had formerly said in the Senate that
<hi>Anthonies</hi> easiness had made the Illyrians tame and supple (though so war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
they were, they had often put him hard to it,) was forced to make
use of all the experience he had, to bring under the Oxeans, the Perthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netes,
the Bathiares, the Taulantians, the Cambians, the Cinambres, the
Merromenians and the Pyrissians: and found yet more difficulty in reducing
the Docleates, the Carinians, the Interfrurians, the Narisians, the Clintidiones
and the Taurisques, and obliging them by force to pay that Tribute they had
for sometime been exempted from. It's true the Victories he gained served
for Example to their Neighbours, and that the Hippassians and the Bessians,
fearful of his power submitted. But the Melitinians and the Corcyrians,
which inhabited the Isles being revolted, he was constrained to imploy a
great part of his Forces to reduce them, for they made Courses, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Robberies on the Sea with their Ships, of which they had a great number.
Wherefore <hi>Caesar</hi> put to the Sword all he took above fourteen years of Age,
and sold the rest at Outry; he also took from the Liburnians their Ships,
because they likewise drove a trade of Pyracy. Of the Nation of the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes
which inhabit in the <hi>Alpes,</hi> the Moentines and Edeates yielded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon the news of his coming, but the Aurupins who are esteemed the
most warlike of those people as well as the most numerous, retired out of
the Country into the City, and hearing he was at hand quitted it, and fled
to the Woods for shelter. <hi>Caesar</hi> having taken the City, would not let it be
burnt, judging they would submit themselves to him as well as the others,
and therefore not long after left it and permitted their return. But they of
all these people that most perplexed <hi>Caesar</hi> were the Salassians, the Japodes
dwelling beyond the <hi>Alpes,</hi> the Segestains, the Dalmatians, the Daissans
and the Peonians, who voluntarily engaged on the Salassians Party. These
last inhabited on the tops of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> in a place almost inaccessible, and
not to be approached but by one difficult and narrow passage. <hi>Veterius</hi>
falling on them unawares, seised upon the Avenue, and besieged them. The
Siege lasted two Years, at the end of which for want of Salt, of which they
stood most in need of, they received a Garrison. At last being revolted
they demolished those Fortifications raised by <hi>Veterius</hi> to keep them in awe,
and possessing themselves of the Crags and Streits, made a mock of
those sent by <hi>Caesar</hi> against them, who could not come to do them any hurt.
Wherefore <hi>Caesar</hi> being then upon the point to make War against <hi>Anthony,</hi>
let them live at liberty, pardoning the attempt they had made upon <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius.</hi>
But they conceiving a wrong opinion of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s facility, began to
draw other Cities to their Party, and to spoil the Lands under the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
obedience, till <hi>Messala Carvinus</hi> sent by the Emperour to besiege them,
reduced them by Famine, and thus the Salassians fell under the Roman
Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> As for the Japodes beyond the <hi>Alps,</hi> who are a fierce and almost Salvage
people, they repulsed twice in twenty years, the Romans that came to
make War upon them, made inroads as far as <hi>Aquileia,</hi> and sackt <hi>Targia</hi> a
Roman Colony. <hi>Caesar</hi> going in person against them, by rough and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Passages, they grew but the more furious, and to hinder his Passage,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65196:103"/>
cut down the Trees that grew by the way side, so as they fell across the
way. After which <hi>Augustus</hi> taking his march through another Forrest they
seemed to fly, but went and lay in Ambush for him, but he being doubtful
of it, sent some of his people over the tops of the Mountains to come and
fall upon them on all sides, and continued his march by the <hi>Vallies,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Wood to be cut down before him. The Japodes all upon a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
sallyed out of their Ambush, and wounded many of his men, but
the most part of their Forces were cut in pieces by the Romans, who came
down from the Mountains, and the rest chose rather to retreat in the Woods,
than into one of their Cities called <hi>Terpona,</hi> which they had abandoned.
<hi>Caesar</hi> having taken it, would not burn it, for he thought as he had made
trial in others, that would engage them to submit, which they did; after
which he marched towards another of their Cities called by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<hi>Metulia,</hi> and is esteemed the Capital of the Country of the Japodes.
It is scituate on a high Mountain covered with Wood, and built upon two
Eminencies divided by a small Valley. The best armed and bravest young men
that any one can imagine ever to have seen defended it, and with ease re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed
the Romans, as often as they approached the Wall. The Besiegers
would have raised Terrasses, but the Metulians day and night fallying out
on all sides upon the Labourers, hindred the Work, and by the means of
certain Engines which they had taken, in the Battel fought not far from
thence by <hi>Brutus</hi> against <hi>Anthony,</hi> and the same <hi>Caesar,</hi> and now planted
upon the Walls, forced the Besiegers to fall off, yet the Romans made a
breach in the Wall, but whilst they fought, the Besieged had raised other
Fortifications within, over which they, though tyred with defending the
breach, leaped into the City. The Besiegers thus become Masters
of the Wall which the Inhabitants had quitted, set<note n="*" place="margin">These Walls were part of Wood, and part of Stone.</note> fire on it, and to gain
the rest raised two Terrases from which they laid over four Planks to the
Rampart newly raised. Things thus disposed, <hi>Caesar</hi> gave order to one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his men to assault the other side of the City to draw the Inhabitants
that way, whilst the others forced their entrance over the Planks, and he
in the mean time took a view of the Action from a high Tower. The Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians
ran upon the Wall to oppose those that passed, whilst another Party
behind them strove to heave up the Planks with their Pikes, which much
heightned their courage, for one Plank being overturned, and then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and after it a third, fear so seised on the Romans that not a man durst
engage upon the fourth. <hi>Caesar</hi> from the Tower sharply reproves them,
but seeing that all he could say, would not move them, he takes his Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
and began himself to run upon the Plank. <hi>Agrippa, Hieron</hi> and <hi>Lucius,</hi>
three of his Captains and <hi>Iolas</hi> one of his Guards followed him with some
Targetiers and got likewise on the Plank. <hi>Caesar</hi> thus deeply engaged,
shame made the Soldiers run on in such Crouds that the Plank overcharged
broke in the middle, and a great Number of people that were upon it fell
one upon another, some were slain, other brought of sorely bruised, and
the Emperour himself was wounded in the Thigh and both the Arms. He
again ascended the Tower with some followers of Consular dignity, that
all might see he was well, lest a rumour of his death might beget some
Tumult, or the Enemy should think he fled, and at the same instant set on
work the laying of another Plank. This more daunted the Metulians then
any thing before, seeing they had undertaken War against a man whose
courage was invincible, whereupon on the morrow they sent Deputies
to treat with him, delivered him the fifty Hostages he demanded, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to receive a Garrison, to whom they left the higher Eminence, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65196:104"/>
themselves into the other. But when the Garrison being entred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
them to yield up their Arms, they entred into such a fury, that shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up their Wives and Children in the Town-house, and having likewise
caused the Officers of the Garrison to enter there, they told them that if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they were so hardy to attempt against them any thing extraordinary, they
would set fire on that building, and by one act of dispair endeavor to
wreak themselves on the Romans. After this discourse they drew toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at the foot of the higher eminence, as if they had a design to mount
up. The Garrison set the Town-house on fire, many of the women kill'd
themselves with their Children, and some threw themselves alive into the
flames. Thus almost all the youth of <hi>Metulia</hi> being slain in the conflict,
and most of the useless persons burnt, all the buildings were likewise
consumed in the flames, so that there scarcely remained any mark of so
great a City. The Metulians thus totally ruined, all the rest of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
submitted to <hi>Caesar</hi> for fear of a like misfortune, and thus fell the
Japodes under the Roman power. <hi>Caesar</hi> being gone, the Possenians shook
off their yoak: but <hi>Marcus Elbius</hi> being sent against them, reduced them
by force, punished with death the authors of the Rebellion, and sold the rest
by Outcry.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> The Romans having already made two Voyages into the Country of the
Segestains, without taking Hostages or doing ought else to subject them,
they grew insolent and presumptuous; Wherefore <hi>Caesar</hi> resolved to make
war upon them, and to take his passage through the Territories of the
Peonians not depending on the Roman Empire. <hi>Peonia</hi> is a woody Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
whose length extends from the Japodes to the Dardanians. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
inhabiting it have no Cities, but live in the Fields, and have Villages
separate, according to their Families; They have not among them either
Judge or Prince that has Superiority over others. They had at present a
hundred thousand Men, but because they knew no Command, could never
form a Body. So when <hi>Caesar</hi> came amongst them they presently fled into
the woods, where if they found any Roman stragling from the rest they cut
him in pieces. As long as <hi>Caesar</hi> thought they would could come in, he
neither touched their Villages nor Towns, but when he saw they kept
themselves close in the woods, he set all on fire making an inestimable
spoil for eight days together, as he cross'd the Country of the Segestains
and Peonians as far as the <hi>Sava. Caesar</hi> on the banks of this River found a
City fortified on one side with the River which was very broad, and on the
rest with a large Ditch, deep and dug downright, so that it was as broad
at bottom as top. Wherefore he made an attempt upon it as a place very
convenient for his stores in the War he designed against the Dacians and
Basternes, which inhabit beyond the <hi>Ister,</hi> which in these places is called
the <hi>Danube.</hi> But when a little lower it is enlarged with great quantity of
waters, it takes the name of <hi>Ister,</hi> instead of that of <hi>Danube.</hi> Now the
<hi>Sava</hi> discharges it self into the <hi>Ister,</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> had Vessels upon that River,
which might bring provisions up the <hi>Danube,</hi> for the subsistance of his
Army. He therefore invested this City, but scarce had made his first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
when the inhabitants of <hi>Segesta,</hi> for that was the name of the
place, sent Messengers to him to know what he demanded of them.
Whereupon he ordered them to receive a Garrison, and to deliver him one
hundred Hostages for security of such Provision and Ammunition as he
should store up in that City for his Service in the War against the Dacians;
and that they should bring him in so much Corn; The Chief Men of the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65196:104"/>
Town thought not these conditions unreasonable, and had certainly gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them had not the People hindred them. The Commons were not
troubled about the delivering the Hostages, for they were well assured
none of their Children would be accepted but only those of the best Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of the City; but when they saw the Garrison approach, they could
not endure to look on them, but in a fury ran to the Gates, shut them, and
mounted afresh upon the Walls to defend them. Wherefore <hi>Caesar</hi> caused
a Bridge to be built over the River, and began his Lines of Circumvalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
After which keeping the inhabitants inclosed, he began to raise two
terrasses, to hinder which the besieged made several Sallies, which not
succeeding they threw down abundance of firebrands; Exspecting relief to
come from <hi>Peonia.</hi> And indeed the Peonians came; but <hi>Caesar</hi> having
laid an Ambush in their way, kill'd a great party of them, and put the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st
to flight, so that they no more concerned themselves in the relief of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesta.</hi>
However the Segestains bravely sustained the siege till the thirtieth
day; but at length after a long and obstinate resistance their hearts failed,
and they learnt to ask pardon. <hi>Caesar</hi> admiring their Valour and moved
to compassion at their Prayers, would not put them to death, nor make
them suffer any thing in their Persons, but contenting himself to make
them pay a sum of Mony, ordered them to retire into one quarter of the
City and placed there five and twenty Cohorts in Garrison.</p>
               <p>That done he went back to <hi>Rome</hi> with design to return into <hi>Illyria,</hi> And <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/>
accordingly upon a Rumor that the Segestains had already defeated the
Garrison that was in their City, made hast thither, though it was the
Winter season: he found the report was false, but that indeed something
had passed which gave occasion to this discourse, that the Garrison had
been in danger, having been assaulted at unawares by the Inhabitants, and
some of them slain, but that the Roman Soldiers falling the next day upon
the Citizens had made themselves secure of the City. Wherefore he
thence marched his Army against the Dalmatians another Nation Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring
on the Taulantians; For since that in the time of <hi>Gabinius</hi> they had
defeated five Roman Cohorts, whose Ensigns they had taken, their hearts
were so puft up, that for ten years together they had not laid down Arms,
but were resolved to come with the Segestains to Encounter <hi>Caesar.</hi> They
were in Number more then twelve thousand, all men of courage, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by a chosen General called <hi>Versus,</hi> who assaulting once more the
City of <hi>Promona</hi> in <hi>Liburnia,</hi> had Entrenched himself with a large ditch
and a good Palisado, and had siesed likewise on some places very strongly
situate, for it is a Mountainous Country full of sharp and pointed Rocks.
He therefore continued his siege of that City with the greater part of his
Forces, the rest he posted on the Mountain tops, from whence they might
with ease discover the Roman Camp. <hi>Caesar</hi> made a show as if he would
inclose them with a wall, but indeed sent privately the most daring of his
men to discover the paths that led up to the mountain tops. They marched
through the woods and having without any noise gained the top of the
Rocks, they fell upon those that guarded them by night, while they yet
slept, and made a great slaughter. At the same time they sent to tell
<hi>Caesar</hi> that they had found the end of the way, but wanted more forces to
perfect the rest. In the mean time they let go from those Rocks they had
surprised by force, some Prisoners one after another, whose report so
terrified those were posted on the other heights that they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
inclosed on all sides, and especially some who wanting water, in
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65196:105"/>
some of the highest places fearing lest all the retreats should be siesed on,
that they forthwith descended to <hi>Promona, Caesar</hi> caused the City and two
hills which the Enemy yet held to be environed with a wall of forty fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
about, and in the mean time went to encounter <hi>Teutinius</hi> who was
coming with another Army, to relieve the besieged, defeats him, chases
him among the Mountains, and in the very teeth of him takes <hi>Promona;</hi>
for before the Circumvallation was finished, the besieged making a Salley
were so vigorously beaten back by the Romans, that they entred Pell Mell
with them into the City, where having slain one part of the Inhabitants, the
rest saved themselves in the Cittadel, he presently siezed on the Town
Gates, and gave the Guard of one to a Roman Cohort, which was the
fourth night assailed by the Barbarians and surprised with the sudden fright
quitted their Post, but <hi>Caesar</hi> coming in enclosed the besieged, who the
next morning yielded to discretion, he pardoned them, but for the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that had quitted their Post, he made them draw Lots, and put to
death every tenth Soldier with two Captains, and for the rest of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
gave them only Barly, while the others had Wheat. Thus was
<hi>Promona</hi> taken. As for <hi>Teutinius</hi> he had in his flight dispersed his Army
into several parties, wherefore the Romans pursued him not very far, for
not knowing the Country, and seeing in the woods so many different paths,
which answered not one to the other, they were fearful of dividing their
Army into so many several bodies. There was in this wood a deep valley
of a long extent between two Mountains, where formerly the Dalmatians
had lain hid to surprise <hi>Gabinius.</hi> Here likewise they laid an Ambush for
<hi>Caesar,</hi> but he set the wood on fire, where the ways met, and dividing his
Army into three parts, of which two took their march on both sides, along
the skirts of the Mountains, that they might at any time come in to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
and he with the third marched through the valley, causing the wood
to be cut down before him, or setting all on fire, and storming the Towns.
He besieged one called <hi>Setovia,</hi> whither the Barbarians flocked in great
Numbers to cast in some relief, but he being ready to receive them routed
them, so that none could get into the City. Yet he was wounded in the
Knee with a blow of a Stone, which made him for some time keep his Bed.
Being somewhat recovered he returned to <hi>Rome</hi> to make himself Consul
with <hi>Barbatius Tullus,</hi> whom he took for Colleague, and in the mean time
left <hi>Statilius Taurus</hi> to command the Army. After he had taken possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Consulate in the beginning of the Month, he quitted the same
day the Government of the Commonwealth to <hi>Anthony,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
to <hi>Dalmatia</hi> assuming again the quality of Triumvir though the
last five years time was expired since <hi>Augustus, Anthony</hi> and <hi>Lepidus</hi> had
usurped the Sovereign Authority which was afterwards confirmed to them
by the People. The Dalmatians therefore oppressed with famine, because
all passages for bringing them Provision were cut off, yielded at discretion,
and delivered seven hundred Hostages of their own Children. He deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of them the Roman Ensigns which <hi>Gabinius</hi> had lost, and ordered them
to pay the tributes formerly agreed upon by <hi>C. Caesar,</hi> of which till
now they had defer'd the payment. Thus for the future they became
more obedient, and <hi>Caesar</hi> sent away the Ensigns in the Galley called the
<hi>Octavian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> The Dalmatians brought under subjection. The Derbains upon the
News that <hi>Caesar</hi> marched towards them, sent him likewise Deputies to
implore his favor with offers to give Hostages, and pay those tributes, they
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65196:105"/>
had for some time neglected, so that when he came nearer they delivered
up their Hostages, and confirmed the Ancient Treaty, which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to do whilst he was farther from them, by reason of his wound. It
seems to me that of all the people of <hi>Illyria<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> they were the last reduced by
<hi>Caesar</hi> under his obedience, either of those revolted against the Romans or
which had never been under their Dominion. Wherefore the Senate
granted him the Honor of Triumph over the Illyrians, though he triumphed
not till after the Defeat of <hi>Anthony.</hi> The rest of the People of <hi>Illyria</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the opinion of the Romans, are the Rhetians situate before the
Peonians, and after the Peonians the Noricks and the Mysians, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
themselves to the Euxine Sea, and I am of opinion that the Rhetians
and the Noricks were either subdued by <hi>C. Caesar,</hi> when he made War
upon the Celtes, or by <hi>Augustus</hi> in his Expedition against the Peonians, for
I find not that any Roman did particularly make War upon these Nations,
which makes me the rather think they were made subject at the same time
with their Neighbors. True it is that <hi>Marcus Lucullus</hi> brother to <hi>Lucius
Lucullus</hi> that defeated <hi>Mithridates,</hi> overran all <hi>Mysia</hi> as far as the <hi>Ister,</hi>
near which there are four Greek Cities <hi>Istros, Dionysopolis, Odyssa</hi> and
<hi>Mesembria,</hi> and that he brought out of <hi>Gaul</hi> that great Statue of <hi>Apollo</hi>
which is to be seen in the Palace; but I do not remember to have read, that
ever any Roman that had Command in the Commonwealth, ever had any
thing farther to do with the Mysians, or ever forced them to pay tribute, no
not <hi>Augustus</hi> himself. As for <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who was Emperor after <hi>Augustus,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is that the Mysians were under his obedience, but I have spoken of all
these things in writing the actions of the Roman People before the Conquest
of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> And as for the Countries possessed by the Emperors after the
subduing of <hi>Aegypt</hi> as they relate to their particular Actions, so after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
treated of general Affairs, I have wrote a particular Book wherein
mention is made of the Mysians in divers places. But since the Romans
reckon the Mysians among the people of <hi>Illyria,</hi> I was willing to make this
mention of them in this Volume, Entitled the wars of <hi>Illyria,</hi> which I should
not have thought perfect, if I had not set down, that a long time before
<hi>Lucullus</hi> commanding under the authority of the People, had made
incursions into <hi>Mysia,</hi> and that <hi>Tiberius</hi> had re-united it to the
Empire.</p>

THE Gauls were the first of any people in the World, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
came to make War upon the Romans, they set the whole
City on fire after they had taken it, saving only the Capitol.
<hi>Camillus</hi> defeated them, and chased them from <hi>Rome,</hi> and
sometime after being returned in Arms to the Gates of the
City, the same <hi>Camillus</hi> again defeated them, and triumphed at the age
of fourscore Years. They undertook a third expedition into <hi>Italy,</hi> but
the Roman Army commanded by <hi>T. Quintus,</hi> enclosed them round, and
made a horrible slaughter. After that the<note n="*" place="margin">Burbon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> Boiens the most valiant of all
the Gauls, being entred in Arms into the Roman Territories, <hi>Sulpitius</hi> the
Dictator, went against them and overcame them, by this way of fighting,
he divided his Forces into four Battalions, of which the first went and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
their piles upon the Enemy, and presently retired; the second did
the like, and so the third, and fourth in their order, avoyding by this means
the Darts thrown at them by the Enemy. And after they had all discharged
they joyned their Bodies, and with terrible shouts ran desperately with
their Swords in their hands upon the gross of their Enemies, for they
thought the Gauls already maimed with showers of Piles, would be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
daunted, when they saw themselves so furiously charged, by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men together. And indeed all the Army of the Boiens were cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by the Romans, who with much bravery, put the Orders into Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
now the Pile is a sort of Arms differing from the Javelin; for the
Shaft is square, and the Iron of the same length with the Shaft, square in
like manner and only sharp at the point. <hi>Popilius</hi> defeated likewise ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Army of the Gauls, and after him <hi>Camillus,</hi> the Son of the first <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
another. <hi>Aemilius Probus</hi> likewise erected Trophies for a Victory gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ore the same Nation, but sometime before the consulate of <hi>Marius,</hi> a
prodigious multitude of Gauls, all valiant men, and in the Flower of their
Age, made an Irruption into <hi>Italy,</hi> and into the Narbonese Province; where
having beaten some Roman Consuls, and pillaged their very Camps, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
was sent against them, who cut them all in pieces.</p>
               <p>The last and greatest of all the Wars the Romans had against the Gauls,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
was under <hi>Caesar,</hi> for in ten Years that he commanded in <hi>Gallia,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
four Millions of men, of which one Million were taken Prisoners in
Fight, and as many slain, he reduced under his obedience four hundred
Nations, and eight hundred Cities, reckoning as well those who being
revolted he forced to return to their duty, as those he conquered. It is
true that before <hi>Marius, Fabius Maximus Aemilianus,</hi> having with a
small Power assailed a vast Army of Gauls, killed sixscore thousand of them,
in one only Battel; and though he was then afflicted with a Wound new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
received, yet he performed this noble Action by going through the
Ranks sometimes in his Litter, and sometimes on foot, sustained only by
two men on each side of him, encouraging his men, and teaching them
how to deal with the Barbarians.</p>
               <p>To proceed. <hi>Caesar</hi> having began his War by the<note n="*" place="margin">Suisses.</note> Helvetians and<note n="*" place="margin">Canton of <hi>Zurick.</hi>
                  </note> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurians
put two hundred thousand of them to the Rout; of whom the
first were defeated by <hi>Labienus</hi> his Lieutenant, and the other with the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courians
that assisted them, by himself (these were the same Tigurians
who formerly had caused the Army of <hi>Piso</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> to pass under the
Yoak, as we read in the Chronicle of <hi>Claudius Paulus</hi>) After which he
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:65196:107"/>
made War upon <hi>Ariovistus</hi> and the <hi>Germans,</hi> the lowest of whom was tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
then the tallest Roman. They were fierce and salvage, despisers of
death (being perswaded they should one day rise again) equally patient of
heat and cold, and upon a need could live themselves on raw Herbs, and
feed their Horses with the green Sprouts of Trees. Yet they seemed
to be people not addicted to labour, and who fought not so much with
Reason and Discipline, as with fierce and brutish Violence, in which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
had the advantage of them, for they for their parts ran on all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with such a fury that they made whole Legions recoyl, whilst the
Romans easily giving ground without breaking their Ranks, got the day
by their Conduct, and at last cut in pieces fourscore thousand of them.
After this Victory <hi>Caesar</hi> having assailed the<note n="*" place="margin">Hollanders.</note> Belgians at the Passage of a
certain River, and killed such numbers, that the heaps of dead Bodies
served for a Bridge to pass over his Army, but he was hard put to
it by the<note n="*" place="margin">Those of the Diocess of <hi>Cambray.</hi>
                  </note> Nervians who surprising him in his March, before he could put
his Army in order, made a horrible slaughter. Most of his Tribunes and
Centurions were slain in this conflict, and himself forced to retreat to a
Hill with his Guards, where the Enemies kept him besieged, till the tenth
Legion falling into the Besiegers Rear cut them all in pieces, though they
were no less then sixty thousand men descended of the Cimbrians and the
Teutons. The same <hi>Caesar</hi> defeated the<note n="*" place="margin">Savoyards.</note> 
                  <hi>Allobroges,</hi> and slew four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand<note n="*" place="margin">Dutchies of <hi>Zupthen Cleves</hi> and <hi>Berg.</hi>
                  </note> Usipetes and Tencterians, as well armed as disarmed,
but the Sicambres assaulting at unawares five thousand of his Horse only
with five hundred put them to flight, yet they were afterwards defeated,
and paid dear for their boldness. <hi>Caesar</hi> was likewise the first of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
that crossed the <hi>Rhine,</hi> or passed over into <hi>Brittain,</hi> an Island so great
that it seems another Continent, and of which till then the Romans had no
knowledge, He took his time when the Sea was low to embarque his
men, and the Flood coming in, his Fleet was raysed up by the Waves, at
first insensibly, then a little faster, till at last having Wind and Tide, he
came over into <hi>Brittain.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> THE Pyrenaean hills extend themselves from the Tyrrhene Sea,
to the Northern Ocean. On the East of which inhabit the
<hi>Celtae</hi> surnamed Galatians, or Gauls, and to the West the
<hi>Celtiberi,</hi> possessing all that circuit of ground, which is
washed by the Tyrrhene Sea, and so round about by the Pillars
of <hi>Hercules</hi> to the vast Septentrional Ocean; for all <hi>Spain</hi> save only what is
inclosed by the Pyrenaean Mountains, which with a mighty and almost
streight line separate it from the rest of <hi>Europe,</hi> is embraced by the Sea.
But though it may be sailed round, yet the inhabitants only navigate the
Tyrrhene Sea, as far as <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillars, forbearing the West and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern
parts, unless when they are carried to <hi>Brittain</hi> with the tide which
sets that way only half the day. Beyond, neither the Romans, nor any of
the Romans Subjects ever adventured. But <hi>Iberia,</hi> or (as some call it)
<hi>Spain,</hi> is of too vast an extent to be imagined only one Region, for as
well in length as breadth it reaches near<note n="*" place="margin">One thousand two hundred and fifty miles.</note> ten thousand Furlongs, abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with divers and sundry Nations, and many Navigable Rivers. Who
were the first and most ancient Inhabitants of <hi>Spain</hi> (being only to write
a Roman History) I think not very necessary to make any strict inquiry
into, but certainly the <hi>Celtae</hi> at some time or other climbing over the Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeans,
and mixing their habitations with the Iberians, from thence gave
them the Name of Celtiberians. 'Tis my Opinion likewise, that from
very Ancient time, the Phenicians for Traffick sake sailing to and fro,
possessed themselves of some parts of <hi>Spain.</hi> As also some Greeks brought
to <hi>Tartessus,</hi> to King <hi>Arganthonius</hi> by Sea, might very probably seat
themselves in those places (for <hi>Arganthonius</hi> then Reigned in <hi>Spain,</hi> and
<hi>Tartessus</hi> was a Maritime Town which is now called <hi>Carpessus).</hi> But that
Temple of <hi>Hercules</hi> which at this day stands near the Pillars, seems to be
built by the <hi>Phenicians;</hi> from this sole Argument, that even with in our
memory, that God was there worshipped with Phenician Ceremonies,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65196:108"/>
and called the Tyrian, and not the Theban <hi>Hercules.</hi> But I willingly forbear
writing of those Antiquities. This fruitful Country abundant in all good
things, the Carthaginians before the Romans attempted and invaded, and
already were possessed of some parts, and spoiled and robbed others, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the Romans driving them out, soon became Masters of all they possessed,
and the Remainder likewise, after long time, much labour and frequent
revolts, being by them brought under, they divided into three parts, to
each of which they sent Pretors. Now how they subdued them, and how
first with the Carthaginians, and afterwards with the Celtiberians they
waged War, shall be the subject of this Book; the first Part of which contains
the Carthaginian Affairs: For their concerns in <hi>Spain,</hi> it was necessary
for me to transfer to the Spanish History, for the same Reasons as I have
in the Sicilian History treated of such things, as were acted between the
Romans and Carthaginians in <hi>Sicily,</hi> from the time that the Romans first
crossed over into that Island, and began to usurp the Dominion of it; for
the Romans first waged a tedious War with the Carthaginians, in <hi>Sicily</hi>
for <hi>Sicily</hi> it self, and another in <hi>Spain</hi> for <hi>Spain,</hi> whilst at the same both led
mighty Forces into other of their Enemies Territories, and these wasted
<hi>Italy</hi> and those <hi>Lybia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this War began in the hundred and fortieth Olympiad, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
after the breach of the League, made in the Sicilian War, upon this
occasion. <hi>Amilcar,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Barcas,</hi> at such time when he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as General the Carthaginian Army, had made promise of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to the Mercenary Gauls, and Auxiliary Africans, which when they
at his return into <hi>Lybia</hi> laid claim to kindled the African War. In which
besides many damages suffered by the Carthaginians from the Africans
themselves, they yielded up <hi>Sardinia</hi> to the Romans, as a reprizal of those
losses the Roman Merchants had in this African War sustained. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Barcas</hi> summoned by his Adversaries to Judgement, as the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of inflicting all these calamities upon his Country, having drawn to
his party the Heads of the Commonwealth (by the means especially of
<hi>Asdrub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l</hi> his Son-in-law, who was very popular) not only evaded a Trial,
but a War then happening with the Numidians, prevailed to be chosen
General with <hi>Hanno,</hi> sirnamed the Great, before he had given any account
of former administration. This War ended, and <hi>Hanno</hi> for some Crimes
recalled, he remaining sole Commander of the Army, with his Son-in-Law
<hi>Asdrubal,</hi> crossing the Strait, comes to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and though he had
received no injury from the Spaniards, wasts their Confines, seeking on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an opportunity to continue abroad, do some great Actions, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to exercise his liberality to the people: For whatever he took by War
he so divided, that the Soldier had one part, to oblige them to be the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stier
Associates of his Rapines, one part he sent to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and another
distributed into Gifts, to such of the Heads of the Commonwealth as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
him; and this course he held till several petty Spanish Kings, and
other powerful men, conspiring against him by this means, cut him off.
They yoked Oxen into Carts loaden with Wood, and driving them towards
the Enemy, marched themselves armed behind, which when the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans
perceived, not dreaming of any such daring deceitful design, they
burst out into a laughter; but when they came so near as to engage, the
Spaniards setting fire to the Wood, drove their Carts amongst the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and the flame growing violent, the Oxen hurrying them hither and
thither, disordered the Africans, and breaking their main Body, the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65196:109"/>
Spaniards slew <hi>Barcas</hi> himself, and many others coming in to their relief.
But the Carthaginians having already tasted the sweetness of Spanish plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
would not so give over, but sent again fresh Forces into <hi>Spain,</hi> whom
they gave Commission to <hi>Asdrubal, Amilcars</hi> Son-in-Law, to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
And he chose <hi>Hannibal</hi> (soon after famous for warlike exploits)
though now but a young man, yet very daring, and well beloved by the
Soldiery, for his Lieutenant General. By whose labour and diligence in
Warlike Affairs, together with his Curtesie and Eloquence (in which he
excelled) he added to his Command a great part of <hi>Spain,</hi> extending the
power of his Arms from the Western Ocean to the River <hi>Ib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rus,</hi> which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
<hi>Spain</hi> in the midst, and about five days journey from the Pyrenean
Mountains runs into the Septentrional Ocean. But the Saguntines, which were
a Colony of the people of <hi>Zant,</hi> and other Greeks, who inhabited the
Mart-towns, and other places of <hi>Spain,</hi> growing jealous of their own safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
sent Ambassadors to <hi>Rome.</hi> The Senate, who were unwilling to have
the power of the Carthaginians advanced or enlarged, dispatched an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassie
to <hi>Carthage,</hi> where it was agreed, that the limits of the Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Empire should be the River <hi>Iberus,</hi> beyond which neither should it be
lawful for the Carthaginians by Arms to provoke their Allies, nor for them
to pass over to make War upon the Carthaginians, but the Saguntines,
and other Greeks should enjoy their liberty. And to this end a solemn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
was signed on both sides. In the mean time, while <hi>Asdrubal</hi>
governed that part of <hi>Spain,</hi> subject to the Carthaginians, a Slave (that he
might offer an acceptable Sacrifice to the Ghost of his dead Master, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly
murdered by <hi>Asdrubal</hi>'s command) suddenly and privately assaulting
him, as he was carelesly hunting, slew him, and being soon after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
of the Fact, was with dreadful Torments put to death by <hi>Hannibal;</hi>
who forthwith, though very young, yet dearly beloved by the Soldiers,
was by the Army saluted General, and their Military Grant confirmed
by consent of the Senate. When the death of <hi>Amilcar</hi> and <hi>Asdrubal</hi> was
known among those, who in several parts of the Commonwealth stood in
fear of their Power, they began to despise <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s youth, and to transport
the crimes of the dead on their Clients and Friends; the people consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the Accusers, and mindful of past injuries, making others guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the sorrows they had under <hi>Amilcar</hi> and <hi>Asdrubal</hi> patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured:
even to the compelling those that from them had received great
presents to restore them to the Publick, as part of the Prey gotten from
the Enemy. They therefore sent Letters to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> desiring his assistance
and support, and warily advising him, that if he neglected those, who
should be his assistants as home, he would become contemptible to all his
Fathers Enemies: But he of himself fore-seeing all these things, and not
being ignorant, but that by endangering his Friends, they laid Snares for
him, as formerly they had done for his Father and Brother-in-Law,
though it behoved him to be very careful of his Conduct, lest always fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
delaying and dissembling his hate, he should be tormented with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
debate, and perpetually exposed to the lust and will of the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian
people, light and inconstant, and ever ingrateful to those deserved
best of them. Besides Fame reported, that when yet a Boy, his Father
had at the flaming Altars made him swear, That when ever he should be
called to Office in the Commonwealth, he should be an eternal Enemy to
the Romans. For this reason he imagined, that if he could involve his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in lasting and difficult troubles, and distract them with high and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
undertakings, his Friends would be safe: He now beheld not only <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:65196:109"/>
in Peace, but likewise the Carthaginian Dominion in <hi>Spain;</hi> but if
he could stir up War with <hi>Rome</hi> (which he vehemently desired) he thougt
his fellow Citizens would have their Heads filled with cares and fears,
whilst he, if this War had happy success, should gain immortal glory, having
added to his Country the Empire of the World, which if taken from the
Romans there were no other Competitors for it: Or if his hopes failed
him, future Ages would at least applaud his noble attempts.</p>
               <p>To give a brave beginning to these Designs, he consulted how to cross <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
the <hi>Iberus;</hi> and having commanded the <hi>Torboletae,</hi> Neighbours to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntines;
whose Fields the Saguntines had wasted to come to him, sends
them to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and among other secrets, writes that the Roman Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
sollicited the Carthaginian allies to revolt, charging herewith those
of <hi>Saguntum,</hi> and weaving all he did with craft, so often writes this, that at
length the Senate decreed he should deal with the Saguntines, as he thought
fit. Laying hold on this occasion, he contrived that the <hi>Torboletae</hi> should
again come to him to complain against the Saguntines, who summoned
to send to him their Deputies; when they were come, he commanding
all matters of Controversie, between both parties, should be disputed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, they answered, That they referred all things to the Romans;
whereat <hi>Hannibal</hi> enraged, commanded them forthwith to depart the
Camp, and himself the same night, with all his Forces, crossing the <hi>Iberus,</hi>
began to waste their Territories, and to bring his Engines before the City,
which because he saw he could not take by force, he begirt with a Trench
and Pallisado, raising Towers at convenient distances, and resolving to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it by Siege. The Saguntines oppressed with this sudden and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
invasion, sent Ambassadors to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Senate with them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
away others: First, to admonish <hi>Hannibal</hi> of the League; and if
he would not obey, then to go to <hi>Carthage</hi> to complain of him. These
arriving in <hi>Spain</hi> by Sea, were coming towards the Camp, when <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
forbid them to advance any farther. Wherefore they bent their
course directly towards <hi>Carthage,</hi> where being arrived, and pleading the
Solemn League and Contract, the Carthaginians accused the Saguntines
of having wronged their Subjects: the Ambassadors proposed, That the
difference should be decided by Roman Judges: they replyed, They used
not to refer wrongs to judgement, which they could revenge themselves of.
This being reported at <hi>Rome,</hi> some voted the sending present assistance to
the Saguntines, but others judged it better to delay it, because in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Peace they were not written Allies to the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> but
free, and to enjoy their Liberty. This last opinion carried it: So that the
Saguntines despairing of the Roman aid, all things growing scarce, by
reason of the long Siege (for <hi>Hannibal</hi> finding it at first well stored, and
abounding in all things, was the more industrious to straiten them)
they by Publick Proclamation commanded all the Gold and Silver, both
Publick and Private, to be brought into the Market place, and there that
it might be of no use of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> melted it down with Lead, Brass, and
other baser Metals. Then thinking it more honourable to dye fighting,
than be starved with hunger; made a Sally by night, and with great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fell into the Africans Quarters, yet sleeping, and suspecting no such
thing, killing some, as they rose out of their Beds, and trembling, snatch'd
at their Arms, and others, as they opposed them: but after a tedious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
many Africans, and all the Saguntines were slain. The Women
from the Walls beholding the death of their Husbands, some threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:65196:110"/>
from the Roofs of their Houses, others hanged themselves, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
cut their Childrens Throats. This was the sad end of a City, once
rich and potent. <hi>Hannibal</hi> finding how they had cheated him of his Gold,
in a rage caused all the Captives, and Youth remaining, to be slain. But
the City being seated near the Sea, and not far from <hi>Carthage,</hi> in a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Soil, he restored and replenished with new Inhabitants, making it
a Carthaginian Colony, which is now, as I think the same called<note n="*" place="margin">Car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to deliver up <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as having broken the League, unless they
would by publick assent own whatever he had done, and if they refused
to deliver him, forthwith to declare War. The Demand being made,
because they would not deliver up <hi>Hannibal,</hi> the War was in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
denounced. The Ambassador smiling, and putting his hand into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
told them, <hi>I bring you here, O Carthaginians, either War or Peace,
chuse which you will have:</hi> They cryed out, <hi>Do thou then give us which
thou please:</hi> Whereupon he profering War, they all said they accepted
it, and forthwith sent commands to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that freely the League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now broken, he should now overcome all <hi>Spain.</hi> He marching to
the neighbouring people, either by perswasions, force or fear gained them;
gathered together mighty Forces, but revealing to none the design he had,
though his strength were bent to the War in <hi>Italy,</hi> he had already sent
Agents into <hi>Gaul,</hi> and some to make discovery of the passages of the <hi>Alpes,</hi>
and how he might best carry his Forces to <hi>Italy,</hi> leaving his Brother <hi>Asdru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
in <hi>Spain,</hi> whilst the Romans supposed they had only a War to manage
against the Carthaginians in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> without the least suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that ever they would enter <hi>Italy:</hi> For they had sent <hi>Tiberius Semproni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Longus</hi> with one hundred and sixty Ships, and two Legions into <hi>Africa.</hi>
But what <hi>Longus,</hi> or other Roman Generals did in <hi>Africa,</hi> is set down in
the Punick War. Moreover, into <hi>Spain</hi> they sent <hi>P. Cornelius Scipio</hi> with

                  <hi>Cneus</hi> did nothing memorable in <hi>Spain,</hi> before his Brothers coming;
But the time of his Magistracy expired, the Romans gave Commission to
the new Consuls to prosecute the War in <hi>Italy,</hi> and against <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the
room of <hi>Publius;</hi> and commanded him to go Proconsul into <hi>Spain:</hi> from
which time both of the Brothers joyntly maintained the War against <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal,</hi>
the African General till such time as <hi>Syphax</hi> King of the Numidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
making War upon the Carthaginians, they called him home with the
greatest part of his Forces, and in his absence they easily overpowred the
rest, and as they were no less expert in the Duty of Generals then skilful
in alluring, and pacifying the minds of men, they drew many Cities to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65196:110"/>
their Party. But after Peace concluded with the Numidian King, the
Carthaginians sending <hi>Asdrubal</hi> with a more powerful Army and thirty E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants,
joyning in Commission with him two Colleagues, <hi>Mago,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<hi>Asdrubal</hi> the Son of <hi>Gilco,</hi> War lay heavier upon the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, who
yet oftentimes retired victorious with the slaughter of many <hi>Africans</hi> and
Elephants. Till Winter coming on, the Africans retired among the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditani</hi>
and for the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, <hi>Cneus</hi> went and wintred among the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonenses,
and <hi>Publius</hi> among the Castulovenses; which last having advice
of <hi>Asdrubal</hi>'s advancing that way, going out of the City with a small Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
only to discover the Enemies Camp, imprudently fell in with <hi>Asdru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
and his Horse, by whom both he and all that were with him were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred
and cut in pieces. In the mean time <hi>Gneus</hi> Ignorant of this Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
had sent some Soldiers to his Brother to receive Corn, who joyning
Battel with another Party of Africans they unexpectedly met upon the way:
news of it being brought to <hi>Cneus,</hi> he made hast to their relief, with such
Soldiers as he had in readiness, but the Carthaginians having before cut in
pieces the other Party, fell upon <hi>Cneus</hi> likewise, and forced him to fly for
shelter to a certain Tower, which setting on fire they burnt him and all his
people. This misfortunate end had those two brave men the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Spaniards, especially those gained by their Conduct, to the Roman
alliance, in no small regret for their loss.</p>
               <p>The Fathers at <hi>Rome</hi> grievously afflicted at this distaster, sent <hi>Marcellus</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/>
(newly come from <hi>Sicily)</hi> and with him <hi>Claudius</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi> with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horse, ten thousand Foot, and store of Provision, who whilst they
sloathfully manage Affairs, the Carthaginian Power mightily increased in
<hi>Spain,</hi> almost all the Province being possessed by them, and the Romans shut
in the Pyrenean Mountains, which reported at <hi>Rome,</hi> more sadly disquieted
the Fathers, fearful lest whilst <hi>Hannibal</hi> wasted those parts of <hi>Italy</hi> next
the <hi>Alpes,</hi> the Africans should make a descent at the other end, wherefore
though they willingly would have given over this Spanish War, yet they
thought it not safe, apprehensive lest it likewise might be transferred to <hi>Italy,</hi>
and therefore appointed a day of assembly, for the nominating a Proconsul for
<hi>Spain,</hi> but when no man then stood for it, their fears revived, and a sad si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
seized all the assembly. Till <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> (the Son of <hi>Publius</hi> slain
in <hi>Spain)</hi> a very young man (being not yet twenty four years of Age) but
prudent and valiant, and of a strong constitution, stept forth in the midst of
the people, and with a brave and noble boldness, discoursing first of his
Father, and then of his Uncle, deploring both their misfortune, added
that he alone was left of that Family to be the revenger of his Father, his
Uncle, and his Country, and copiously and magnificently subjoyning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other things, as if inspired by some Divine Spirit promising not only
the recovery of <hi>Spain,</hi> but the Conquest of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> it self, so
that his discourse seemed to some to proceed only from youthful Levity, but
because he cheared the peoples fainting minds with hope (for promises
are Cordials to any that are in fear) thinking he had a heart fit for these
great things, they chose him General for <hi>Spain,</hi> but the Old men interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this rather a confident rashness in him, then a setled bravery of mind;
which when <hi>Scipio</hi> perceived he recalled the people to the Assembly, and
with the same Gravity as before, speaking of his Age, said that it ought to
be no objection to his undertakings, yet if any one of riper Years, would
accept the command, he was ready to yield it to him. But none taking up
the offer, he went with greater admiration and applause to this War, with
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thousand Foot, and five hundred Horse (for he was not permitted to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:65196:111"/>
carry greater Forces, whilst <hi>Hannibal</hi> wasted <hi>Italy)</hi> with Mony and other
warlike Provision, and twenty eight Ships, which carried him into <hi>Spain,</hi>
where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oyning the Remain of the old <hi>Spanish</hi> Army to those he brought,
and calling a Counsel, he confirmed the Soldiers minds, with a noble and
eloquent Oration. And already the Fame was spread throughout all
<hi>Spain,</hi> weary of the Carthaginian Government, and desirous of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s
Vertue, that <hi>Scipio</hi> the Son of <hi>Scipio</hi> was come, a General sent to them by
the Counsel of the Gods. And <hi>Scipio</hi> himself knowing the opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of him, much improved it, by pretending to do nothing but by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
from above. But when he had certain knowledge that the Enemy
had four standing Camps, at good distance from each other, and that
their numbers were five and twenty thousand Foot, and two thousand five
hundred Horse, and that all their Stores, Money, Corn, Arms, Darts,
Ships, Captives and Hostages for all <hi>Spain,</hi> were laid up in the City, called
formerly <hi>Saguntum;</hi> but now <hi>Carthagena,</hi> where <hi>Mago</hi> commanded with
ten thousand Carthaginians; he resolved, as thinking the Garrison of no
great strength, first to invest this place, both because he was desirous to
possess himself of such Stores, and because he understood, if he took this
City, abounding in Silver, Gold, and all Riches, and whence it was but a
short passage into <hi>Africa,</hi> it would be a secure retreat for him both from
Sea and Land. Encouraged by these hopes, all men knowing whither he
designed, about Sun-set he Discamped, and all night long marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Carthagena,</hi> and about break of day, began to open his Trenches,
to the great terrour of the Enemy, who dream'd not of his coming; the
next day he prepared for the assault, and disposed his Engines and Scaling
Ladders, about all parts of the Town, save only in that place, where the
Walls are low, by reason of the Seas washing them; for which reason
likewise they are the less vigilantly defended. Then at night, when all
were armed with Darts and Stones, the Fleet likewise lying before the
Haven, lest the Enemies Ships should slip out (for this brave spirited
man had conceived a certain hope of taking the Town) before day he
advanced with his Machines, commanding those on the Machines to
charge: <hi>Mago</hi> at the Gates instructs his ten thousand, that when they saw
it convenient, they should rush forth only with their Swords, for that
Spears would be of little use in those narrow places; the rest of his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
he posted upon Towers, disposing many Engines, Stones, Darts, and
Catapults upon the Walls, and with great diligence attending the Affair:
At length the shot being given, the charge was stoutly made and received,
Stones, Darts, and other sorts of missile Arms, flew about with great
violence, some from hands, some from Machines, and some from Slings;
and if there were any other device, it was made use off. But <hi>Scipio</hi>'s men
were hard put to it, for those ten thousand men that were at the Gates,
rushing out with their Swords in their hands, upon those that thrust for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Engines, and giving and taking many wounds, the dispute was
a long time equal: till at length by unwearied courage, and fixed reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
the Romans got the the better; and then Fortune changing, those
who stood upon the Walls began to be afflicted: but when the Scaling
Ladders were applied; the Carthaginians, who had sallied only with their
short Swords speedily returning into the City, shut the Gates, and leap'd
upon the Walls: So that now new work and labour was cut out for the
Romans. Whilst these things were doing, <hi>Scipio,</hi> who was no where
absent, encouraging and chearing up his men; observing about noon that
the water was fallen away, from that part where the Bay washed the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65196:111"/>
ower Wall (for at certain hours the Sea Eb'd and Flow'd) and was now so
shoal, some places it was not above brest, and in others scarce midleg
high; and knowing the Nature of the Bay, that it would continue thus
shallow all the remainder of the day, until the accustomed return of the
Tide, he cryed out with a loud voice, <hi>Now Soldiers, now is the time, now
God our helper comes, now storm that Wall, where the Sea of its own accord
withdrawing opens you a way: Now with speed bring your Ladders, I my self
will show you the way.</hi> This said, snatching a Ladder, he sets it to the Wall,
and would himself first have mounted, if his Esquires and other Soldiers
had not hindred him; but they therewith clapping many Ladders at once
to the Wall, and both sides meeting with great noise and fury, made a
mighty slaughter of each other, till the Romans having possessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of some of the higher Towers. <hi>Scipio</hi> filling them with Trumpets
and Cornets, commanded them to sound as loud as possibly they could, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the custom when a City is taken; whilst in the mean time others
running about, fill'd all places with tumult and confusion; and some in
this disorder of their Enemies leaping over the Walls, and let in <hi>Scipio</hi>'s
whole Army, whereupon the Townsmen run to their Houses, and <hi>Mago</hi>
with his ten thousand drew up into the Market place, where being most
at the first charge slain, and he only with a few fled to the Castle; <hi>Scipio</hi>
presently following, and <hi>Mago</hi> perceiving no hopes of safety left, his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
being all utterly dismay'd and astonished, yielded himself. Thus by
his Gallantry and good Fortune, a rich and powerful City in one day (the
fourth of his setting down before it) reduced under <hi>Scipio</hi>'s power; he
began to conceive hopes of mighty things, and now the common Fame
spread concerning him, that he acted nothing but by Divine Counsel,
was more and more confirmed, and himself had the same opinion, believing
henceforward all his undertakings directed from above; and whenever
he went into the Capitol, having caused the Gates to be shut, he often
staid there a long time, as if he had been conferring with some God; whence
now in solemn Pomps a Statue of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s is only brought out of the Capitol,
and all the rest out of the place of Assemblies. This City thus taken, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with all things necessary for Peace or War: <hi>Scipio</hi> found there vast
quantities of all sorts of spoil, store of Arms, Darts, Engines, Rigging,
and thirty three Gallies, Corn and sundry sorts of Provisions; Ivory, Gold
and Silver, as well wrought into Vessels and coined, as uncoined in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,
together with all the Spanish Hostages and Prisoners, and
such as had before been taken from the Romans. The next day having
sacrificed, celebrated the Victory, and applauded the Soldiers Valour;
he likewise assembled the Townsmen, and in an Oration admonished them
to keep in memory the Name of the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s. Then he sent the Captives
every one to their homes, hoping by this kindness to bring over their Cities
to his party. He likewise distributed rewards to the Soldiers; to him who
first mounted the Walls, a very large one, to the second half so much,
to the third a third part, and to the rest according to their Deserts and
Valour. What Gold, Silver or Ivory he found, he sent upon the Enemies
Ships to <hi>Rome,</hi> where they decreed three days Supplication, because af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so many Miseries the Publick Happiness began to take breath: but the
greatness and celerity of this bold attempt, sorely terrified both the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,
and the Carthaginians that were in <hi>Spain. Scipio</hi> leaving a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in <hi>Carthagena,</hi> and giving orders for raising higher the Wall to the Sea
side, went himself about the rest of the Province, or sent Friends into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts to renew an alliance with them, and those who would not
comply, he reduced by force of Arms.</p>

the Son of <hi>Gisco,</hi> sending Agents to those Cities, who had hitherto
continued faithful to the Carthaginians, to perswade them still to continue
their fidelity, in a short time hoped to see innumerable Forces in <hi>Spain;</hi>
and <hi>Mago</hi> he sent into all the adjacent parts to list men under pay, whilst
in the mean time himself in <hi>Lersa</hi> entring in hostile manner into their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
who had fallen off; prepared to lay Siege to some Towns, but
frightned with <hi>Scipio</hi>'s sudden approach, he retreated to <hi>Baetica,</hi> and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
both the City and his Camp, where few days after he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by <hi>Scipio,</hi> who possessed himself both of Camp and City: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he issued out Orders for all the Carthaginian Forces through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Spain,</hi> to come to the City of <hi>Careo,</hi> resolving with his whole united
Power to fall upon <hi>Scipio.</hi> And already, there were come in to him no
small number of Spaniards under <hi>Mago</hi>'s Conduct, and Numidians under
the Command of <hi>Massanissa. Asdrubal</hi> with his Foot lay entrenched,
<hi>Massanissa</hi> and <hi>Mago</hi> with his Horse in Quarters: <hi>Scipio</hi> had so divided
his Foot as to send <hi>Laelius</hi> with one part against <hi>Mago,</hi> whilst himself with
the other fell upon <hi>Massanissa.</hi> This fight was somewhat doubtful and
dangerous to the Romans; for the Numidians at a distance threw their
Darts, and so wheeling off, returned again to the charge at pleasure; but
when <hi>Scipio</hi> commanded his men, that after throwing their Piles with all
their force, they should press in as hard as they could upon the Enemy, then
the Numidians not having room to wheel, were worsted, and fled away to
their Camp: <hi>Scipio</hi> in a strong and safe place, as he could wish for, pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Camp, within ten furlongs of his Enemy. In the Carthaginian
Army were seventy thousand Foot, fifteen hundred Horse, and thirty six
Elephants. <hi>Scipio</hi> had not a part of that number, wherefore he for some
time forbore fighting, save only for some light skirmishes; but when through
want of Provisions, hunger began to afflict his Army, thinking it disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
to retreat, having first sacrificed; suddenly (though otherwise
his Army were both willing and ready enough) he affirmed, God had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to custom appeared to him, and exhorted him to engage the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
that they should rather relye upon the Divine Conduct, then upon
force and multitude; for the greatest Victories were not gained by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Men, but by the grace and favour of the Gods. And whilst they
gave credit to his words, he commanded the Diviners to bring forth the
Entrails; and as he was speaking, seeing some Birds fly to and again
with great rejoycing and earnestness he showed them, as a certain sign
of Victory, given him from above; and as if at the sight of them, he had
been possessed by some spirit, now viewing them, and now crying out,
turned about after them, the whole Army imitating their General in his
several postures; and he turning this and that way towards the Soldiers,
stirred them up as to a Victory already prepared for them, till now having
wrought them up to his wishes, he thought not convenient to let their
Courage cool by any delay; but whilst they were perswaded, all he yet
spoke was by Divine Instinct, not in the heat of that perswasion, after such
lucky signs, protract the fight: Wherefore, as soon as they had eaten, he
commanded his Soldiers to Arms, and giving the charge of the Horse to
<hi>Syllanus,</hi> and of the Foot to <hi>Laelius</hi> and <hi>Martius</hi> rushed unexspectedly
upon the Enemy, for the Camps being but ten furlongs distant from each
other, <hi>Scipio</hi> was upon them before <hi>Asdrubal</hi>'s, <hi>Mago</hi>'s or <hi>Massanissa</hi>'s
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65196:112"/>
men could take any food to refresh them, forcing them hastily to snatch
up their Arms, not without great Consternation and Tumult. Both Horse
and Foot being then engaged, the Roman Horse got the better; for as
they had done in the former fight, charging home, and with great fury
upon the Numidians, so that they could not make a retreat, and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
wheel about upon the Enemy, they soon made their Darts ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
But the Foot much inferiour in number, were oppressed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricans,
and were now yielding up the honour of the day, nor would by
any of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s encouragements or exhortations be perswaded to stand, till
the General himself giving his Horse to his Boy, and snatching a Shield,
runs alone between both Battels, and with a loud voice crying out, <hi>Now
or never Romans rescue your</hi> Scipio <hi>from danger.</hi> At that voice, both those
those who stood next and saw, and those farther off who heard what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
he was in, altogether moved, as well with respect as fear for their
General, with great outcrys ran violently upon the Enemy, whose charge
the Africans not able to sustain, (for towards evening their strength failed
them for want of Food) began to give ground. Then in a short time
was made a most horrible slaughter; such success had <hi>Scipio</hi> at the Battel
of <hi>Careo,</hi> which long time seemed doubtful and dangerous, there were
slain about eight hundred of the Romans, and about fifteen thousand of
the Enemy. <hi>Scipio</hi> pursued the Africans, who made a hasty retreat, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing
and charging them in Flank or Rear, where-ever he could reach
them, till they having gained a certain Post, fortified by Nature, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
for Water and Provisions, and inexpugnable by any means, but
a tedious Siege, called upon by other Affairs, he left <hi>Syllanus</hi> to block them
up, and went himself through the rest of <hi>Spain,</hi> reducing the Cities to
obedience. The Africans besieged by <hi>Syllanus,</hi> by little and little made
their retreat towards the Sea side, that they might get over into <hi>Cadiz,</hi>
followed in their March by <hi>Syllanus,</hi> who incommoded them to the utmost
of his power, and returned to <hi>Scipio</hi> to <hi>Carthagena.</hi>

               <p>Now <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> the Son of <hi>Amilcar,</hi> having towards the Northern <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/>
Ocean leavied new Forces, being called by his Brother <hi>Hannibal</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi>
taking his March along the Coasts of the North Sea, that he might secure
himself from <hi>Scipio;</hi> and crossing over the Pyrenean Mountains, he got
down in <hi>Gaul</hi> with a numerous Army of Celtiberian Mercenaries; and
thus unknown to the Romans made haste into <hi>Italy.</hi> Mean while <hi>Lucius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
from <hi>Rome,</hi> told <hi>Scipio</hi> that the Romans had some thoughts of send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to command in <hi>Africa;</hi> which being what he himself had often
before hoped and wished for, he dispatched away <hi>Laelius</hi> in five Ships to
<hi>Africa,</hi> with presents to King <hi>Syphax,</hi> to put him in mind of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and to entreat him to enter into a League offensive and defensive
with him, if the Romans should send any Forces into <hi>Africa: Syphax</hi>
having accepted the presents, and returned others, promised to do as he
desired; which when the Carthaginians heard, they likewise sent Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
to <hi>Syphax,</hi> to treat an Alliance with him, whereof <hi>Scipio</hi> having
certain intelligence, and judging wisely, that if the Carthaginians should
rob him of <hi>Syphax</hi> friendship, it would be a thing of no small importance,
he resolved to go in person to him, and accompanied with <hi>Lelius,</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked
on two Gallies, and steered his course towards <hi>Africa,</hi> when he
came nigh the shore, and was upon the point of entring the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
the Carthaginian Ambassadors (unknown to the King) armed
out those long Ships they had, and in hostile manner went to meet him,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65196:113"/>
but <hi>Scipio</hi> setting his Sails was too swift for them, and got safely into Port.
<hi>Syphax</hi> invited both parties to be his guests but privately made a league
with <hi>Scipio,</hi> and having engaged himself by faithful promise dismissed
him, and lest the Carthaginians should have any design to intercept him,

to Sea, that he was out of danger, this hazard <hi>Scipio</hi> run both in the

besides having driven another body of an Army commanded by <hi>Hanno,</hi>
consisting of seven hundred Horse and six thousand Foot, to a certain
eminence, he reduced them to such scarcity, that they sent Agents to him
for peace, he commanded them to deliver up <hi>Hanno</hi> and the Fugitives,
and then he would treat with them; Whereupon presently laying hold
upon <hi>Hanno</hi> (who stood by and heard all this) they delivered him up
with all the Fugitives. <hi>Martius</hi> then demands the Prisoners, whom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

Hereat the Celtiberians grievously incensed cryed all out with one voice
they would not lay down their Arms, whereupon followed a sharp engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:

<hi>Scipio</hi>'s who being slain, the Romans that escaped the slaughter flying hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

spared neither Sex nor age, not suffering their rage to cool till they levelled
the whole City with the ground. <hi>Scipio</hi> being from thence come to <hi>Castace,</hi>

himself to <hi>Carthagena,</hi> sending <hi>Syllanus</hi> and <hi>Martius</hi> towards the Sea-coasts,
that as far as they could they might wast and spoil the whole Country.
There was a certain town called <hi>Astapa,</hi> which had ever sided with the
Carthaginians, the inhabitants whereof being besieged by <hi>Martius,</hi> and
well forseeing if they were overcome by the Romans they should be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to perpetual slavery, brought all things they had of value into the
Market-place, and piling up wood about them, placed their Wives and
Children on the top of all, then fifty of their stoutest men compelled by
oath promised, that when they saw the City in such distress, that it must
needs be taken, they would first kill the Women and Children, and then
setting fire to the pile slay themselves. And so invoking the Gods against
<hi>Martius,</hi> with great Noise and Clamor they sallied out, when nothing was
less feared by the Enemy, then that they durst appear without their
Walls, wherefore they easily repulsed the light Armed Foot, and Horse,
which first engaged them, and when an Armed Legion advanced, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
Astapians still fought most couragiously, but at length were forced
to fall under their multitudes, whom they did yield to in valor; being
all slain with their Arms in their hands, those fifty left in the City slew the
Women and Children, and then setting fire to the Pile cast themselves into
it, leaving no fruits of the Victory to the Conquerors. <hi>Martius</hi> admiring
the Astapians, spared the buildings.</p>
               <p>After these things <hi>Scipio</hi> fell sick, and while <hi>Martius</hi> commanded the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/>
Army, some Soldiers who had spent their means in luxury and riot, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
because they had nothing, they should have no rewards, for all their
labors, but both the Advantage and Honor of all was done, would redound
to <hi>Scipio,</hi> openly deserted <hi>Martius,</hi> and encamped by themselves, to
whom many in like manner flocked from the Garrisons, <hi>Mago</hi> hereupon
sent some with Mony to encourage them to a revolt: the Mony they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and created among themselves new Leaders and Centurions, who
managed all things as they pleased, and had their own Councils; when
<hi>Scipio</hi> heard hereof, he sent Letters apart to these deserters telling them,
that being prevented by sickness he could not yet reward them. Others
he sent to those not yet infected with this Contagion, advising them to
recal their mad fellow Souldiers to their duty, and others again, to all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as if they were reconciled, wherein he wrote that he should be
ready to pardon any that had slipt aside, commanding them all to come to
<hi>Carthagena,</hi> and receive their pay; while these letters were reading, some
thought they were not to be trusted, others gave full credit to them, At
last they agreed among themselves to go all together to <hi>Carthagena.</hi> In
the mean time <hi>Scipio</hi> gives directions to those Senators, that were with
him, that as soon as any of the heads of this conspiracy came, they should
accost them in a friendly manner, pleasantly admonishing them, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them to be their guests, privately secure them: he likewise gave
Order to his Tribunes, that at dawn of day they should get together the
most faithful of their Souldiers, with their Swords by their sides, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
them in the most convenient places of the Assembly, if any tumult
should begin they should presently fall on, and kill without expecting a
signal. Not long after day light, the General getting up was brought to
the Tribunal, and the Cryers were commanded to call the Soldiers to the
Assembly. They not expecting the Cryers call, thinking it would be very
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:65196:114"/>
rude if they should make their General, who had not yet fully recovered
his strength, wait longer for them (imagining withal that they were called
to come and receive rewards) ran in hast from all parts, some without
Swords and others for hast, only with a loose Coat about them, not staying
to put on other Cloaths, <hi>Scipio</hi> (the appointed guards keeping close) first
reproved them sharply for their Villanous Action, but <hi>Yet,</hi> said he, <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
is only to be inflicted on those were Authors of the crime, in doing
which I will use your help;</hi> Scarce had he spoke these words but the
Croud dividing as if he had given them a sign to do it, the heads of the
mutiny were by the Senators set forth in the midst, exclaming as they were
led along, and imploring their fellow Soldiers help, but whoever at their
Outcrys did but murmur, were presently slain by the Tribunes. The rest
of the Croud perceiving the whole place of Assembly beset with Armed
Men in a sad silence hung down their heads, whilst those brought into the
midst of them, were by <hi>Scipio</hi>'s command first scourged with Rods, and
then fastned to the stake, had their heads struck off with Axes; which
done he made the Cryers to proclaim pardon to the rest. In this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
stood <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Army. There was one <hi>Indibilis</hi> a little King, and one of
those who had made a League and Confederacy with <hi>Scipio,</hi> who at the same
time that the mutiny was in <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Army, in hostile maner invaded the
Territories of some of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Allies, and when <hi>Scipio</hi> led the Army against
him, maintained so stout a fight, that he slew twelve hundred of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
but having lost twenty thousand of his own, he sent Ambassadors
to <hi>Scipio</hi> to crave peace, which for a considerable sum of Mony was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him. <hi>Massanissa</hi> likewise crossing the Sea unknown to <hi>Asdrubal,</hi>
came to a conference with <hi>Scipio,</hi> and giving him his right hand promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that if he could come over into <hi>Africa,</hi> he would give him all the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
he could. This was a man in all things constant to his Faith, but
he for this reason fell off from the Carthaginians, <hi>Massanissa</hi> was betrothed
to the Daughter of <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> the General under whom he now made
War, and <hi>Syphax</hi> almost died for this Ladies Love, wherefore the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians
judging of what importance it would be to them, in this present
War if they could joyn to their party against the Romans so Potent a King,
without consulting the Father, gave him the Daughter in Marriage, and
and this <hi>Asdrubal</hi> out of respect to him, kept secret from <hi>Massanissa,</hi> but he
finding it out some other way, sought thereupon <hi>Scipio</hi>'s friendship. <hi>Mago,</hi>
having still a fleet to command, seeing the affairs of <hi>Spain</hi> grown despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
sailed among the Ligurians and Gauls, there to raise Mercenary Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
After his departure those of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> as if betrayed by <hi>Mago,</hi> yielded
themselves to the <hi>Romans,</hi> from which time first began the Roman Custom
to send Annual Magistrates into <hi>Spain</hi> as to a Conquered People, to keep in
Peace and Govern the Province, which hapned in the hundred forty fourth
Olympiad. But <hi>Scipio</hi> leaving the whole Country in Peace, with no very
strong Garrisons (placed all the Soldiers weakned with wounds, together
in one City, which from <hi>Italy</hi> he called the Italian, famous for the birth
of <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Adrian,</hi> who after in succeeding times came to be Roman
Emperors) and himself building a Magnificent Fleet, with a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Captives, and loaden with Mony, Arms and other spoils, returned
to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was received with mighty Pomp to his great and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
glory, as well because of his youth, as because of the Expedition
wherewith he had done so many Noble exploits, insomuch that those who
envyed him, confessed that his actions had far exceeded his Rich Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
wherefore to the admiration of all Men he received the Honor of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:65196:114"/>
                  <hi>Indibilis</hi> who as soon as <hi>Scipio</hi> was gone rebelled, was by those

and Auxiliaries from their Allies, fought with and slain, the stirrers up of
the Rebellion were brought to tryal, their goods confiscate, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignly

greater<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Cato,</hi> with larger Forces was sent for Successor, a young Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
but solid, patient in labor, and so fam'd for Prudence and Eloquence,
that he was among the Romans called <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> by way of comparing
him with that most Excellent of all the Graecian Orators, He arriving in
<hi>Spain,</hi> when he came among the Mart Towns, there gathered about him
from all parts above forty thousand Enemies. Having taken a little time
to Exercise his Soldiers, when the signals on both sides were hung out, and
the Armies ready to Engage, he sent away his fleet to <hi>Marsilia,</hi> telling the
Soldiers the present danger was not so great, in their Enemies being su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
to them in Numbers (for that nothing was difficult which stedfast
courage could not overcome) as in their want of shipping, so that they
had no way of refuge or safety left but in being victorious, And having
thus spoken led his Soldiers to the fight, not filled with hopes according to
the custom of other Generals, but with the terror of their danger. The
Battels being joyned he went every where intreating, pressing forward,
and incouraging his Men, and when the fight had continued doubtful till
evening, not a few falling on both sides, he with three Cohorts of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
went to the top of a high hill, from whence he had a clear prospect
of the whole Action, where observing his Main Body much oppressed, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
down with great shouts and fury upon the Enemy, and first exposing
himself to danger, he gave a beginning to the Victory. All Night he gave
the Enemy chase slaying Multitudes, and possessing himself of their
Camp: at his return he congratulated his Soldiers embracing them as the
Authors of the Victory, then giving them that time to refresh their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
by repose, which their labors required, he afterwards sold the prey.
But when Deputies came to him from all parts to crave Peace, he first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Hostages, and afterwards signing Letters, sent them to all the
People severally, giving order to those that carried them, to take care,
that they might be delivered in one day, which he had appointed, having
before computed in how long time a Messenger might be going to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest
City, and accordingly to the rest. By these Letters he Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Magistrates of every particular City, that the same day on which
they received his Orders, they should demolish the Walls of their City,
which if they delayed, he denounced their slavery. They newly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
in battel, and ignorant, whether these Commands were sent to the
rest, or to them only, were tormented with great fears, for if this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
were to them alone, they knew themselves not able to withstand the
Romans, and if the Command were general, they were no less fearful
lest they should be the only City delay'd it's execution. Therefore, and
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65196:115"/>
because they had not time to send mutual Messengers to each other, and
were likewise urged to dispatch by those who brought the Orders, every
one having their own safety only in prospect, they all diligently set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
about throwing down their Walls, for when they had once decreed
obedience, they thought their Celerity would prove to their advantage,
and those whose Walls were first demolished should have the Honor of it.
Thus all the Cities about the River <hi>Iberus</hi> by the policy of the General, in
one day levelled their own Walls, the consequence of which was, that by
reason of their weakness, they continued longer in Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> Some years after, about the hundred and fiftieth Olympiad the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
about the River <hi>Iberus,</hi> and the Lusones with many Spanish Exiles
and Fugitives revolted from the Romans. These being defeated by <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius
Flaccus</hi> fled to their several Cities, but the greatest part having no
land, and only laboring for their bread, chose <hi>Complega</hi> for their habitation,
a City newly built, and strangely and suddenly become powerful; from

many of those Cloaks, <hi>Flaccus</hi> with the Army following their Deputies,
pitcht his Camp before the City. But they having Souls too mean to
maintain so lofty a Command, betook themselves to flight wasting the
lands of the Barbarians their Neighbors. Now the Spaniards went doubly
clad, their upper garment being loose and fastned together with buttons
which they called a Saga, or Cloak.</p>

same time when twenty thousand Celtiberians besieged <hi>Carabis</hi> a City in
Alliance with the Romans. Which because strong reports were raised of
it's being taken, <hi>Gracchus</hi> hastned the more to relieve. But when he found
it so encompassed with Enemies that he could not give the besieged any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of his coming. <hi>Cominius</hi> Captain of a Troop of Horse having first
well weighed the matter, and acquainted <hi>Gracchus</hi> with it, puts himself in the
Spanish dress, and cunningly mixing with the Enemies Forragers, passed
through their Camp for a Spaniard, and thence by running reached the
City, telling the Townsmen, that <hi>Gracchus</hi> was at hand, whereupon they
with courage underwent all difficulties till the third day, when the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
retreating at <hi>Gracchus</hi> approach, they were delivered from the siege.
About the same time near twenty thousand Men coming out of <hi>Complega</hi>
towards <hi>Gracchus</hi> Camp, with boughs in their hands after the manner of
suppliants, when they drew near, as if upon a sudden they had changed
their minds they made an assault, filling the whole Army with fear and
terror, but <hi>Gracchus</hi> by singular policy dessembling a flight, deserted his
Tents and presently after facing about, and setting upon them intent on
the Plunder, slew a great number, and taking the City subdued likewise
the Confines. After which dividing the Lands among those wanted, and
giving them seats to inhabit in he made a League with all the People that
inhabited those quarters, chiefly on condition that they should be friends
to the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to that end mutual Oaths being given and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
they in future Wars proved very serviceable to the Romans, for these
things <hi>Gracchus</hi> name grew famous both in <hi>Spain</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> which he
Magnificently entred in Triumph.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:65196:115"/>
Not many years after, a new and general War was kindled in <hi>Spain</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/>
upon this occasion: <hi>Segada,</hi> a large and powerful City of those Celtiberians
called <hi>Belli,</hi> received into the League by <hi>Sempronius Gracchus,</hi> inviting the
Citizens of lesser Towns to joyn with them, began to build a Wall four
hundred furlongs about; and compelling the <hi>Titthi,</hi> a neighbouring peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to do the same. The Senate having certain intelligence hereof; first
forbid the building of the Wall, next demanded the Tribute imposed by
<hi>Gracchus:</hi> And lastly, (for this was an Article in <hi>Gracchus</hi> League) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
they should attend the Romans in War. As to what concerned
the Wall, the Celtiberians answered, That indeed they were forbid by
<hi>Gracchus</hi> to build any new Cities, but about restoring or fortifying old
ones, there was not a word spoken; and for the Tribute, and Service,
it was since <hi>Gracchus</hi> time, remitted by the Romans themselves. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed so it was; but when the Senate dispenses with any such priviledges,
they always add this exception, so long as it shall be to theirs, and the
people of <hi>Romes</hi> good liking. <hi>Nobilior</hi> was therefore sent against them
with an Army of near thirty thousand; whose coming the Segedians
foreseeing, because their Wall was not yet perfect, fled with their Wives
and Children to the <hi>Arvacci,</hi> beseeching them to receive them, who not
only entertained them, but chose likewise <hi>Carus</hi> a Segedian, a man quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for War, for General; who the third day after entrance into his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
with twenty thousand Foot, and five thousand Horse, takes his
Post in a place fit for Ambushes, being quite covered over with Trees. There
as the Romans passed by, he charged them, and fought a long time without
advantage: but at length, with the death of six thousand Roman Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
(as that time no small loss to the City) he bravely overcame them;
but after the Victory, with too much eagerness and disorder, pursuing
those that fled; the Roman Horse left in guard of the Carriage, falling on,
first slew <hi>Carus,</hi> bravely opposing them, and with him no fewer than six
thousand men. Night coming on, ended this dispute. This slaughter hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
on a day by the Romans consecrated to <hi>Vulcan,</hi> wherefore unless
forced to it, they will not on this day engage an Enemy. The very same
night the <hi>Arvacci</hi> met together at <hi>Numantia,</hi> a very strong City; and created
two new Generals, <hi>Ambo</hi> and <hi>Leuco.</hi> Three days after <hi>Nobilior</hi> following
them, encamps within four and twenty Furlongs of the City, whither came
to him three hundred Horse, and ten Elephants sent from <hi>Massanissa,</hi> with
which he advances towards the Enemy, placing the Elephnts behind the
first Battel, that they might not at first be discovered by the Enemy. The
Fight beginning, his Front falling off, the suddain sight of those Beasts so
terrified both the Celtiberians and their Horses, who never before had seen
Elephants, that turning their backs they fled to the Town. The Roman
General pursuing, the Flyers turns the Elephants to the Wall, there main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a sharp conflict, one of the Elephants wounded in the head with
a great Stone, grew angry, and setting up a horrible roaring, turns upon
his own Party, and without distinguishing Friend from Enemy, began to
rage against all he met. The rest set on by his roaring began to do the
same, and in all places to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for it is usual for Elephants when they are once vexed, to take all
they meet for Enemies; for which perfidiousness, they are by some call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the common Enemy. A general flight hereupon began among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
which the Numantines from the Walls beholding, made a sally,
and falling in upon them, dispersed and trampled down, slew four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65196:116"/>
of them, and three Elephants, and took many Arms, and some En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs:
Of the Celtiberians there were about two thousand slain: <hi>Nobilior</hi>
a little recruited after the loss, endeavouring in vain to force the City of
<hi>Auxenium,</hi> where the Enemy had stored up their Provisions, with the loss
of no few men retreated into his Camp. Thence he sent <hi>Biasius,</hi> who
commanded his Horse, to certain neighbouring people, that joyning friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with him, they might assist him with some Horsemen. He return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and bringing some Horse with him, the Celtiberians lay in Ambush
for him, who being discovered, his associates fled; but <hi>Biasius,</hi> and many
of the Romans with him were slain: So many losses and disasters began to
turn their Allies hearts from them. <hi>Ocylis,</hi> a City in which were the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines
of Provisions and Treasure, revolted to the Celtiberians. <hi>Nobilior</hi>
distrusting all things in the present necessity, wintred in his Tents, covered
and close stopped: but his want of Corn (for he had his store with him)
was very great; besides the violent hail, and bitter cold cruelly afflicted the
Soldiers, so that many of them going to fetch in Wood, and others in their
hard Winter Lodgings dyed with Distempers, caused by the extremity of
the weather.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/> The next year <hi>Claudius Marcellus</hi> succeded <hi>Nobilior</hi> in his command,
bringing with him eight thousand Foot, and five hundred Horse. At his
first coming the Enemy in vain laid ambushes for him, for proceeding
circumspectly and cautiously, he brought the Army in safety, and pitch'd
Camp before <hi>Ocylis,</hi> which City (being a General fortunate in War) he
presently subdued, and taking Hostages, and thirty Talents of Silver,
pardoned them. The Nergobriges hearing of this clemency, asked what
they should do to obtain Peace likewise with him, he demanded a hundred
Horse to go to the War with him. Those they promised, but in the mean
time, some of them falling in the skirts of the Roman Army, plundered
some of the Baggage; soon after the Horse they had covenanted to send
coming, and being demanded concerning the Baggage, they made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that some ignorant of the agreement made had done it; but <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi>
commanded them to be dismounted, and their Horses sold; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
dividing among his Soldiers the prey he had gathered, wasting
their Fields, he besieged the City. The Nergobriges, when they saw
that the Engines brought close to the Trench, had shaken their Walls,
sent a Herald, who instead of a <hi>Caduceus,</hi> was cloathed in a Wolves skin,
to ask pardon for their faults: the General refused it, unless with them
all the <hi>Arvani, Belli</hi> and <hi>Titthi</hi> would ask it likewise, which when they
signified to them, they forthwith sent all of them Deputies to <hi>Marcellus,</hi>
to entreat him that content with a moderate punishment, he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
receive them into the Conditions of <hi>Gracchus</hi> League. This Petition
some people a little before by them provoked to War opposed; wherefore
<hi>Marcellus</hi> commanded the Legates of both parties to dispute it before the
Senate; but by private Letters he advised the Fathers to decide all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies;
for he was very desirous in the time of his Government, to put
an end to this War, supposing he should thereby get Renown and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Now Ambassadors sent from confederate and associate Cities, were
wont to be admitted into the City, and treated as Guests; but these, as
coming from Enemies, were according to Custom commanded to lodge
in the Suburbs; the Senate taking it ill that they, though <hi>Nobilior,</hi> who
was in <hi>Spain,</hi> before <hi>Marcellus</hi> had given his opinion for them, had not
permitted it to the Romans, so they disallowed the Peace, and gave the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65196:116"/>
Legates no other answer, then that <hi>Marcellus</hi> should declare to them the
Senates pleasure. Then decreeing an Army for <hi>Spain,</hi> they chose the
Soldiers by Lot, which formerly they used to enrol by Centuries; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
many had complained to the Consuls, that they had hard measure,
while others were employed and taken up for easier service, they thought
it best to chuse the Army by Lot. <hi>Licinius Lucullus</hi> Consul was made Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and <hi>Cornelins Scipio</hi> his Lieutenant. Whilst he is going to this
War, <hi>Marcellus</hi> advises the Celtiberians of the approaching War, and
restores the Hostages to those redemanded them. After which privately
sending for the Chief of the Ambassadors, sent to <hi>Rome</hi> in the name of the
Celtiberians, and keeping him a long time with him, he gave occasion to
a suspicion (which he afterwards much more increased) that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to perswade the Celtiberians to leave all things to his Arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he endeavouring by all means possible to put an end to the War, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Lucullus</hi> coming: For presently after this Conference, five thousand
<hi>Arvacci</hi> got into the City of <hi>Nertobriga.</hi> And <hi>Marcellus</hi> leading his Army
against <hi>Numantia,</hi> and their Camps lying within five furlongs of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when he drove the Numantines into their Walls, <hi>Litennus</hi> their Prince
stopping their course, cryed out he desired conference with <hi>Marcellus.</hi>
This <hi>Marcellus</hi> heard with joyful ears, and receiving the Hostages and
Money he demanded, sent them all home in peace. By this means, before
<hi>Lucullus</hi> came, the War with the <hi>Belli, Arvacci</hi> and <hi>Titthi</hi> was brought to
an end.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Lucullus,</hi> as covetous of Glory, as of adding to his private For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/>
which was but very slender, presently with his Army enters the
Confines of the <hi>Vaccaei,</hi> a Nation of the Celtiberians, bordering upon the
<hi>Arvacci,</hi> though he neither had command from the Senate, nor had they
made any War upon the Romans, or any other way offended him; and
crossing the River, called <hi>Tagus,</hi> comes to the City <hi>Cauca,</hi> and sets down
before it: The Citizens inquiring wherefore he came, and what occasion
there was for War; he answered, He came to the assistance of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitani,</hi>
whom they had wronged, whereupon they retreated into their
City; from whence, not long after, making a sally upon <hi>Lucullus</hi> men,
gone to provide Wood and Corn, they slew many, and drove the rest to
their Tents. And whenever they came to an Engagement, the <hi>Caucaei,</hi>
who were almost all Light Armed Men, were at the first for a while su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours;
but when their Darts were spent, then they turned their backs,
unskilful, and unaccustomed to a standing Fight; so that once flying to
their City, by reason of the croud at their Gates, near three thousand of
them perished. The next day all the gravest of the Citizens came out to
<hi>Lucullus,</hi> with Crowns and Olive Branches to know of him upon what
Conditions they might buy his friendship; they were answered by Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages,
an hundred Talents in Silver, and their Horsemen going to the
Wars with the Romans; which being presently agreed to, <hi>Lucullus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
he might place a Garrison in the City, which the <hi>Caucaei</hi> likewise
yielded to; he brings in two thousand of his chosen men, whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
as soon as they were got in to possess themselves of the Wall.
This done, he lets in all his Army, and at the Signal given by sound of
Trumpet, commands them to fall on, and kill all the <hi>Caucaei,</hi> without any
distinction; who invoking the Gods, presiding over Oaths and Covenants,
and bitterly cursing the Roman perfidiousness, were cruelly murdered, of
twenty thousand very few escaped, by breaking open the Gates: <hi>Lucullus</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:65196:117"/>
having sack'd the City, cast thereby a great infamy on the Roman Name.
The rest of the Barbarians flying out of the plain Country, fled among the
Precipices and places inaccessible, others carried all they could into for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
Towns, and what they were forced to leave they burnt, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
might be left for <hi>Lucullus</hi> to plunder. He therefore having wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
long enough in that Desert Country, came to the Town of <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catia,</hi>
where were drawn together twenty thousand Foot, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horse; whom when <hi>Lucullus,</hi> with imprudence enough, would have
perswaded to enter into a treaty of Peace, they reproached him with the
slaughter of the <hi>Caucaei,</hi> asking whether it were not with the same Right
Hand, and the same Faith he had already pawned to the <hi>Caucaei:</hi> With
which revilings (as it is ordinary for those whose consciences accuse them
of guilt) being extreamly galled, he laid waste their Country. And
then besieging the City, and intrenching himself, he often drew out his
Army in Battel, to try if by any means he could draw the Enemy to a
Battel: but as they, by all means avoided a set Fight, so by continual skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
of Light Armed Foot they annoyed him. But among the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
there was often seen a man remarkable, for the brightness of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
who often coming on horseback between the two parties, dared any
of the Romans to engage him in single Combat, and when none offered
themselves, scoffing at the Romans with many postures of scorn and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
he returned among his own people. When he had often done this,
<hi>Scipio,</hi> though yet but young, much afflicted at it, himself advancing out,
and undertaking the Duel, though but a middly siz'd man, overcame this
Barbarian of a Gigantick stature. This Victory much raised the Spirits of
the Romans; but the next night sundry terrours seised them, which
sprung from this occasion. The Barbarian Horse before <hi>Lucullus</hi> approach,
being gone to Forrage, at their return, finding the City besieged, went
about, calling out, and filling all the places with their clamours, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
answered by those within the Town, the Romans were possessed with
doubtful fears, knowing their posts not over strong, and the Soldiers by
continual watchings, and unusual food extremely weakned, and feeding
only on Wheat and Barly, with the Flesh of Stags and Hares, boiled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Salt, they fell into Fluxes, which swept many of them away. At
length having filled the Ditch, and by often playing their Engines, shook
the Wall, so that part of it fell, they broke into the City; whence vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
repulsed, they upon their retreat, not knowing the ground, fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Common Sewer, where many of them perished. The next night
the Barbarians repaired their Walls. After which neither party able any
longer to dissemble their miseries and losses, the famine growing violent
upon them; <hi>Scipio</hi> freely promised the Barbarians, that if they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into League, they should be treated without any Fraud or Treachery.
The opinion of this mans Virtue was so great among the Barbarians, that
to his Faith they committed themselves, and the War upon these conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
was removed, that the Intercations should give <hi>Lucullus</hi> six thousand
Sagas or Cloaks, a certain number of Cattel, and fifty Hostages, for as
for Gold and Silver, (the thirst after which, believing <hi>Spain</hi> every where
abounded with it, had begot this War) none was given, for it not being
of any esteem among these people, they had it not. From hence <hi>Lucul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
went to <hi>Palantia,</hi> a City much renowned for the Valour of its people,
and whither many others were fled. Wherefore some advised the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to pass by without making any attempt upon it; but a covetous man
could not be drawn away from a City he had been told was rich; till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65196:117"/>
being by many Excursions of the Palantine Horse, cut off from going to
Forrage, through want of Provisions he was forced to divide his Army into
four Bodies, and so make his retreat, pursued by the Palantines in the Rear, till
he came to the River <hi>Dorium,</hi> where they gave over following him. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus</hi>
wintred in <hi>Turdetania:</hi> These were the Actions of the War with the
<hi>Vaccaei,</hi> which though <hi>Lucullus</hi> undertook, and carried on without any
command from the people of <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> yet he was never called to question
for it.</p>
               <p>Much about the same time the Lusitanians (another people of <hi>Spain,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/>
and living under the same Laws) commanded by a Carthaginian, wasted
the Lands of the Romans associates; and putting to flight the Roman Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
<hi>Manlius</hi> and <hi>Calphurnius,</hi> slew six thousand men, and among them
<hi>Terentius Varro</hi> the Questor; with which Victory the Carthaginians puft
up, marched as far as the Ocean, and taking with them the Vetones,
besieged the Roman Subjects, called the <hi>Blastophaenicae.</hi> These as fame goes,
were brought out of <hi>Lybia</hi> by <hi>Hannibal</hi> the Carthaginian, and from thence
took that name. Here the Punick General wounded in the head with a
stone dyed. In his place they substituted a man, called <hi>Caesaras,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in fight with <hi>Mummius</hi> (lately come from <hi>Rome</hi> with an Army)
was routed and fled; but when <hi>Mummius</hi>'s men scattered and dispersed
pursued the Victory, rallying, he slew nine thousand of them, recovered
all the plunder of his Camp, and got all that of the Romans, with many
Colours and Arms, which the Barbarians in derision carried throughout
all <hi>Celtiberia. Mummius</hi> with the five thousand he had left intrenched
himself, not daring to take the Field, till he had somewhat confirmed the
minds of his Soldiers, terrified with the last slaughter. Whence obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Barbarians, carrying by part of their Booty, setting upon them
unawares, they slew many, and recovered the Spoil and the Ensigns. The
Lusitanians inhabiting the other Banks of the <hi>Tagus,</hi> incensed against the
Romans, of their own accord declared War, and under the Conduct of
<hi>Caucaenus</hi> their General, invaded the <hi>Cunaei,</hi> a people subject to the Romans,
taking from them the large City of <hi>Conistergis;</hi> and thence crossing over
the Straits at the Pillars of <hi>Hercules,</hi> some of them went to people <hi>Africa,</hi>
others went and besieged the City of <hi>Ocylis.</hi> These <hi>Mummius</hi> following with
nine thousand Foot, and five hundred Horse, slew fifteen thousand of them,
that were over-running the Country, and as many more at raising the
Siege of <hi>Ocylis,</hi> meeting likewise those who were conveying away the
Spoil, he cut them off so clearly, that there was not a Messenger to tell the
news. Now all the prey that he could carry along with him, he divided
among the Soldiers, and the rest, (consecrated to the Deities, presiding
over the War) he burnt, and for these things at his return to <hi>Rome</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. Attilius,</hi> Successor to <hi>Mummius</hi> making an inrode into <hi>Lusitania<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/>
killed seven hundred men, and taking from them a great City, called <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thracas,</hi>
so terrified all the neigbouring places, that they surrendred on
conditions, among which were some of the Vetones, the farthest people
of <hi>Lusitania.</hi> But <hi>Attilius</hi> being gone, in Winter they all revolted, and
besieged some of the Roman Subjects, whom, whilst he was hasting to
receive <hi>Seroclius Galba</hi> (who came to succeed <hi>Attilius)</hi> marching in a day
and a night five hundred furlongs, comes within sight of the Enemy, and
without any stay, or giving the Soldiers any time to refresh themselves,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65196:118"/>
after such tedious travel, falls on, and after having fourtunately broken
and put them to flight, he very imprudently pursued them; for his men
through weariness following sloathfully, and in disorder: The Barbarians
perceiving them thus dispersed to lye down by the way side to rest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
gathering again into a Body, fell upon them, and slew seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.
<hi>Galba,</hi> with the Horse whom he had kept about his person, got by
flight to the City of <hi>Carmelis,</hi> whither many others likewise fled for safety,
whom drawing into a Body, and raising twenty thousand men among the
Associates, he went among the <hi>Cunaei,</hi> and there wintred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucullus,</hi> who without any orders from the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> had made
War upon the <hi>Vaccaei,</hi> wintring in <hi>Turdetania,</hi> having intelligence that
the Lustitanians had invaded the Neighbours, sending out some of his best
Captains, slew about four thousand of them; and they making a new ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
with other Forces, he about <hi>Cadiz</hi> killed fifteen hundred more,
and pursuing the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t to a Hill, where they had posted themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
them, and took a mutitude of men, and at last entring <hi>Lusitania,</hi>
he by parcels depopulated the Country. The same did <hi>Galba</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side; and when Deputies came to him and desired they might again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the League, which agreed upon before with <hi>Attilius,</hi> then General,
had been violated, he received them kindly, and gave them his word,
seeming grieved for them, that through meer want, they had been forced
to use Robbery, make War, and break Articles of Peace: <hi>But under me,</hi>
said he, <hi>be no longer in doubt, that your poverty, and the barrenness of your
Country shall force you to these things; for if you will henceforward be friends,
I will give to such of you, as are in want, good Land, and dividing you into
three parts, appoint you fruitful seats to dwell in.</hi> Allured by these promises,
they forsook their old Seat, and assembled in great numbers where <hi>Galba</hi>
had commanded, whom dividing into three parties, he ordered each to
march down into the Plains he assigned them, and there for a while wait
till he returned to them. Then coming to the first, as already friends,
he commanded them to lay down their Arms, and thus disarmed, drew
a Ditch about them, and then sending in some with Swords, slew them
all, crying out, and invoking the Faith of Gods and Men. Thus with all
imaginable speed, he served the second and third party, before they could
have any notice of their Companions Calamity. Thus was Treachery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged,
not as became Romans or Roman Clemency, but incitating the
Barbarians savegness and cruelty: yet some of them escaped, among
whom was <hi>Viriatus,</hi> who not long after commanded the Lusitanians, and
performing many worthy Exploits, killed a multitude of Romans; but of
those things, as done afterwards, we shall speak in due time. <hi>Galba</hi> sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
<hi>Lucullus</hi> for covetousness, distributed but little of the prey to the
Soldiers, less to his Friends, and the rest converted to his own use. And
though he were one of the richest of all the Romans, yet as is reported in
time of Peace, he never scrupled at lye nor perjury, so it turned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
hated therefore by all, and cited to judgement; yet by force of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
he got off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not long after those that remained after <hi>Lucullus</hi> and <hi>Galba</hi>'s
Treachery, being gathered together to about ten thousand men, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions
wasted the Country of the <hi>Turd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

come from <hi>Rome</hi> with new Forces, and joyning with those before in <hi>Spain,</hi>
marched with about ten thousand men, who first falling in among their
Forragers slew many of them, and forced the rest to a certain place, where
if they staid, they perished by Famine, and if they removed, were in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
danger of falling under the Romans Swords. So great a strait
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65196:118"/>
they were in, wherefore sending Legates to <hi>Vetilius</hi> with Olive Branches,
they desired a place to dwell in, promising thenceforward to live under the
Roman Power. <hi>Vetilius</hi> gave his word to perform their request, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Conditions were agreed on, when <hi>Viriatus</hi> (who escaped from
<hi>Galba</hi>'s wicked cruelty, and by chance at that time sojourned among them)
began to admonish them of all the Romans Treachery, who after having so
often pawned their Faith to them, had perfidiously assaulted them, telling
them their present Army was only the Relicks of <hi>Lucullus</hi> and <hi>Galba</hi>'s
perjury. Adding, if they would obey him, he would show them a safe
way to retreat out of that place. By which words forewarned, and their
hearts quickned by some hope, they chose him General, whereupon he
first of all draws them up, as if preparing them to fight, then gave orders,
that as soon as they saw him mount his Horse, dispersing themselves all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Country, they should by divers ways get to the City of <hi>Tribola,</hi>
and there staid for him. In the mean time a thousand chosen Horse he
kept with him in a Body: and things thus disposed, at one instant <hi>Viriatus</hi>
mounts his Horse, and they all took their flight. <hi>Vertilius</hi> afraid to pursue
men so dispersed; seeing <hi>Viriatus</hi> standing, turned towards him, thinking
to provoke him to fight, who seemed to offer the occasion: but <hi>Viriatus</hi> by
the swiftness of his Horse, eluding all his endeavours, sometimes retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and sometimes advancing, but keeping in continual motion, spent all
that day, and the next upon the same ground. Till conjecturing that by
this time, his fellows fled before might be in safety; he set forward by
night, and through by-ways, and on nimble Horse soon got to <hi>Tribola.</hi>
The Romans, both because of their heavy Armour, ignorance of the ways,
and withal being mounted on other kind of Horses, not being able to
follow him. Thus <hi>Viriatus</hi> saved the Army, when themselves were in
utter despair, and lost to all hopes. The bravery of which Exploit being
spred among the Barbarians, added to him both Honour and Power,
many joyning with him, by whose assistance he held out three whole years
against the Romans. I have therefore designed to write here at once
all this Viriatick War, which gave no small trouble to the Romans; and
if any thing happened in the mean time in <hi>Spain,</hi> to relate it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vetilius</hi> therefore pursuing <hi>Viriatus,</hi> came to <hi>Tribola,</hi> but in the way as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVIII"/>
he was passing over a certain woody Hill, <hi>Viriatus</hi> having got behind
with his Horse, and an Ambush rising in Front both at once, set upon
the Romans, whereof they slew many, threw others down into the
Vallies, and many fell into their hands alive, among whom was <hi>Vetilius</hi>
whom he that took, seeing old and fat, thinking him good for nothing,
slew him. Of ten thousand Romans scarce six thousand escaped to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pessus,</hi>
which I suppose was once by the Greeks called <hi>Tartessus,</hi> where
King <hi>Arganthonius</hi> (who is reported to have lived one hundred and fifty
years) once reigned. The Soldiers escape by flight, and yet trembling,
<hi>Vetilius</hi> his Questor dispose upon the Walls, and five thouand associates,
which he had desired from the <hi>Belli</hi> and <hi>Titthi;</hi> he sent out to meet <hi>Viria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
who made such a slaughter of them, that not a Messenger was le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t
to bring back the news. So thenceforward the Questor lay quiet in the
City, expecting assistance from <hi>Rome.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Viriatus,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
controul, wastes the Country of the <hi>Carpeti,</hi> which was sufficiently
fertile, till <hi>C. Pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tius</hi> sent four
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65196:119"/>
thousand men to pursue him, whom turning upon, he cut off all but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few; and crossing the <hi>Taegus,</hi> went and incamped among the Olive
Mountains, upon that which is called <hi>Venus</hi> Hill, whither <hi>Plautius</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
out of an earnest desire to repair his former loss, fights a set Battel
with him, and being with a mighty slaughter overcome, flees without any
order to the Towns for refuge, and in the midst of Summer takes up his
Winter Quarters, not daring look abroad. Wherefore <hi>Viriatus</hi> freely
ranged over the whole Country, forcing the owners of the Ground to pay
a value for the Crop, then almost ready for their Sickle, or else he destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or burnt it. These things being understood at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Fathers sent
<hi>Fabius Aemilianus Maximus</hi> (Son to <hi>Aemilius Paulus,</hi> who subdued <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus,</hi>
King of <hi>Macedon)</hi> with Power to raise an Army; who because the
strength of the City was in a manner exhausted, first by the subversion of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> then by subduing the Greeks, and lastly by bringing to a happy
issue the Macedonian War, that he might spare those had out-lived so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Engagements, enrolled two Legions of raw young Men; and having
procured some further assistance from the Associates, with an Army of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
fifteen thousand Foot, and two thousand Horse, came to <hi>Orso,</hi> a City
of <hi>Spain;</hi> from thence that he might not throw himself upon the Enemy,
with an undisciplined and unexperienced Force that had never yet seen any
fighting, he crossed over into <hi>Cadiz,</hi> to sacrifice to <hi>Hercules. Viriatus</hi>
met with a party of his men going to wood, slew a great many, and put
the rest to flight; and his Lieutenant again bringing them out to engage,
<hi>Viriatus</hi> again defeated them, and took a great booty; but when <hi>Maximus</hi>
himself came, bringing armed Soldiers to try if he could entice him to a
Battel, and daily provoking him, seeing <hi>Viriatus</hi> avoided a general En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
sending out parties by frequent skirmishes, he made trial of
the Enemies strength, and increased his own mens courage and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
aed whenever he sent out to Forrage, he gave a Convoy of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionary
Soldiers and Horse to the light armed Foot, for this Discipline he
had learn'd from his Father in the Macedonian War. Winter being past,
and his Army well exercised and confirmed, he made a sharp War upon <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatus,</hi>
and putting himself to flight, took two of his Cities, and burnt another.
<hi>Viriatus</hi> himself flying to a place called <hi>Baecor,</hi> he followed, and slew many
of his men, and then went and wintred at <hi>Corduba. Viriatus</hi> being now
no longer secure as formerly, drew off from the Roman Alliance the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacci,
Titthi</hi> and <hi>Belli,</hi> warlike people, who waged another long and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
War by themselves, which from <hi>Numantia,</hi> one of their Cities, was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Numantine,</hi> which immediately after the Viriatick, we shall proceed
to treat of. <hi>Viriatus</hi> therefore, in another part of <hi>Spain,</hi> coming to a set
Battel with <hi>Quintius,</hi> another Roman General, and being overcome, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to the Mountains of <hi>Venus;</hi> from whence turning again upon the
Enemy, he slew some of <hi>Quintius</hi> men, took some Colours, and forced the
rest into their Camp. He likewise by force drove out the Garrison at
<hi>Ituca,</hi> and wasted the Country of the <hi>Basitani,</hi> whilst <hi>Quintius,</hi> out of
weakness, and want of Military knowledge, lay shut up in <hi>Corduba</hi> (where
in the midst of Autumn, he took up his Winter Quarters) and only now
and then sent out <hi>C. Martius,</hi> a Spaniard of the Italian City against the
Enemy. That year being expired so, <hi>Quintius Aemilianus</hi> succeeded his
Brother <hi>Fabius Maximus Aemilianus,</hi> bringing with him two Roman
Legions, and some Allies, so that all his Forces might be about sixteen
thousand Foot, and sixteen hundred Horse. He wrote likewise to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipsa,</hi>
King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> to send him with all speed some Elephants: but
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65196:119"/>
hastning to <hi>Ituca,</hi> and leading with him only part of his Army; <hi>Viria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
met with six thousand men, coming on with great noise and clamour,
and with long hair, which the Barbarians used to wear and shake in time
of fight to terrifie their Enemies; yet he bore his charge with so much
courage, that the Enemy was repulsed without effecting any thing. But
when the other part of the Army, with ten thousand Elephants, and three
hundred Horse from <hi>Lybia</hi> were come to him, enlarging his Camp, he
first drew out his Army against <hi>Viriatus,</hi> and over-powring him, routed
and put him to flight: but when breaking their Ranks in the pursuit, <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatus</hi>
observed the confusion, rallying, he slew about three thousand men,
and drove the rest to the Camp: He likewise assaulted their Camp, while
scarce any would shut the Gates again the invading Enemy, but most
struck with pannick fear, hid themselves in their Huts, and neither by
the General nor Military Tribunes could be got out to fight, yet above all
<hi>Fannius,</hi> the Brother-in-Law of <hi>Laelius,</hi> did in this Battel, in a singular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
make his courage manifest. Night coming on, favoured and saved
the Romans. But <hi>Viriatus</hi> night and day omitted no opportunity, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with light armed Foot, and sometimes with nimble Horse to weary
out the Romans, till at last he forced <hi>Servilianus</hi> to raise his Siege from <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuca.</hi>
And himself beginning to be pinched with hunger, and having but
slender Forces, setting on fire his Tents by night, marched towards <hi>Lusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania,
Servilianus</hi> in his going off, not being followed, translated the seat
of War into <hi>Baeturia,</hi> where he seised upon five Cities, that bore good
will to <hi>Viriatus:</hi> Thence led his Forces among the <hi>Cunei,</hi> from whence
he again marched into <hi>Lusitania</hi> against <hi>Viriatus</hi> himself. In this way
meeting with two Captains of Thieves, <hi>Curius</hi> and <hi>Apuleius,</hi> with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men, they very much vexed the Romans, acd joyning Battel wherein
<hi>Curius</hi> was killed, they yet got some booty, all which <hi>Servilianus</hi> not long
after recovered, and likewise took by force the Cities <hi>Escadia, Gemella</hi> and
<hi>Obolcola,</hi> in all which <hi>Viriatus</hi> had placed Garrisons, some of which he
made Captains, and others he let go. Of ten thousand Prisoners he had,
five hundred he made pass under the Ax, and sold the rest. After this he
went to Winter Quarters, leaving the War to him that was to Command
next year, and these things done, returned to <hi>Rome. Quintius Pompeius
Aulus</hi> succeeded him in Command.</p>
               <p>Mean while his Brother <hi>Maximus Aemilianus,</hi> having received upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/>
submission one <hi>Connoba,</hi> a Captain of Thieves, did indeed pardon him,
but cut of all his Companions hands: but when pursuing <hi>Viriatus,</hi> he was
about to inclose <hi>Erisane,</hi> one of his Cities, with a Trench and Palisado.
<hi>Viriatus</hi> entring the City by night, and making a Sally by break of day,
not only drove those that were working upon the Lines from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
making them throw away their Spades and Mattocks, but likewise
forced all the rest of <hi>Aemilianus</hi> Forces ready drawn up, and in a posture
to engage him, to flee among the Rocks and Precipices, from whence there
was no way to escape; yet here succes made not <hi>Viriatus</hi> insolent;
but supposing he now might upon fair Conditions lay down Arms, and
enter into friendship with the Romans; he contracted a League, which
the people of <hi>Rome</hi> afterwards confirmed, and called <hi>Viriatus</hi> friend, giving
Orders his Associates should enjoy the Lands they possessed. Thus a War
heavy to the Romans seemed on easie Conditions quite extinct; but this
Peace proved not lasting, for <hi>Cepio,</hi> brother to <hi>Aemilianus,</hi> Author of this
League, and his Successor in Command, finding fault with the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65196:120"/>
as dishonourable to the Roman people, prevailed with the Senate to
have leave privately to incommode <hi>Viriatus,</hi> as he thought fit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
urging them, and plying them with Letters, at length procured a
Decree to declare open War against <hi>Viriatus,</hi> fortified with which Decree
he received upon surrender the City of <hi>Arsa, Viriatus</hi> looking on; and
pursued <hi>Viriatus</hi> himself, flying and wasting all as he went to <hi>Carpetane,</hi>
bringing with him greater Forces than <hi>Viriatus,</hi> who by reason of the
paucity of his men, not thinking fit to engage, sending away the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part of his Forces, by an obscure Valley, drew up the rest upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Hill, making a show, as if he were willing to fight the Enemy, but
when he thought those sent before were out of danger, he flew after
with so much scorn of the Enemy, and so much celerity, that those who
followed him, knew not which way to take. <hi>Cepio</hi> turning his Arms
against the Vetones and Callaici wasted their Country: but now follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Viriatus</hi> Example, many other Bands of Rovers, by their incursions
wasted <hi>Lusitania.</hi> Against whom <hi>Sex. Iunius Brutus</hi> being sent, he consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the distance of places (being all that ground between the four Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable
Rivers of <hi>Tagus,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Oblivio <hi>or</hi> Limia.</note> 
                  <hi>Lethe, Dorius</hi> and <hi>Boetis</hi>) gave them a hard chase,
they running hither and thither, after the manner of Thieves, and now
following, and then flying, dispairing to catch them, and yet thinking
the not taking of them would be dishonourable, though on the other side
the taking of them would be no great Triumph; he led his Army into
the Thieves own Country, thinking with the same trouble to take revenge
of them (for he thought they would all come home to defend their own)
and withal enrich his Soldiers by the spoil. Led on with these thoughts
and imaginations, he seised upon all stood in his way. The Barbarians
coming out to oppose him, and the Women assisting and bearing Arms
with such courage and eagerness, that even in the midst of slaughter their
voices were not to be heard. Some indeed there were, who taking what
they could, fled up to the Mountains, to whom, because they asked par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<hi>Brutus</hi> gave whatever remained of theirs. Thence crossing the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Dorius,</hi> carrying Fire and Sword through all parts far and near, and
receiving Hostages of all that yielded, at length he came to the River of
<note n="*" place="margin">Lethe <hi>or</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia.</note> 
                  <hi>Oblivion,</hi> and first of any Roman crossed it. Thence going to <hi>Nimis</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
River, he made War upon the <hi>Bracari,</hi> because they had stopped,
and taken the Provisions, bringing to the Roman Camp. 'Twas the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
likewise of these people to bring their Women armed into the Field,
who would rather die than turn their backs, or utter any unworthy cry;
nay, these very Women, when led away Captives, would some kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and others cut their Childrens Throats, thinking Death much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than Slavery, yet some Towns yielded to <hi>Brutus,</hi> who not long after
revolting, he again reduced to obedience; among others <hi>Talabriga</hi> often
accepting Conditions, often rebelled. Thither <hi>Brutus</hi> coming, the Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
imploring mercy, and referring themselves to discretion, he first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to deliver all Roman Fugitives, Captives and Arms, then
that with their Wives and Children they should leave the City, which
when readily they submitted to, inclosing them with his Army, he began
to let them understand how often they had revolted, and how often renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the War; possessing them with an extreme fear and opinion, how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
he was offended with them, and ending all in reproaches of their
Treachery; but yet taking away their Horses, Provisions, and publick
Money, beyond their own hopes, he restored them their Town to dwell
in. After doing all these things, <hi>Brutus</hi> returned to <hi>Rome.</hi> These at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65196:120"/>
of other Bands of Thieves happening in the same time, and after
the Example of <hi>Viriatus,</hi> I thought convenient to place with that War.
But now <hi>Viriatus</hi> sent <hi>Audax Ditalco,</hi> and <hi>Minurus,</hi> the most faithful of his
Friends to <hi>Cepio</hi> to make Peace. These <hi>Cepio</hi> engaged by great Gifts, and
large hopes, to make him a promise to kill <hi>Viriatus,</hi> which at length they
in this manner performed: <hi>Viriatus</hi> was a man given little to sleep, as
well because of the sundry cares distracted him, as because of his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
employs, wherefore likewise he often slept in Armour, that he might
be ready upon all services, and to that end by night the entrance to him
was always open to his Friends, being by this means free to be called at
all seasons. <hi>Audax,</hi> and the Consorts of his villany, observing his first
lying down, as if they had some earnest business, went into his Tent,
and wounding him in his Throat, for that part only of his Body was naked,
slew him as he lay; then without any noise, no one thinking they had
given him his deadly wound, they went out and fled to <hi>Cepio,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
their reward. He only granted them the enjoyment of what then
they had, and referred them to the Senate for rewards. The Day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on, <hi>Viriatus</hi> Clients, and indeed the whole Army thinking him still
at rest, wondered what should make him sleep more than ordinary, till
some going in, let them understand he lay slain in his Arms. Then
presently a general lamentation and mourning was heard throughout the
whole Camp, all afflicting themselves for his death; and beginning to be
doubtful of their own safety, for so they reputed themselves, having lost
a General, who had been conversant in, and had freed them from so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dangers. But that which most of all tormented them was, that they
could not find the Authors of this Villany. Therefore covering the Body
with most magnificent Habits, they burnt it upon a very high Pile, then
Horse and Foot marching in Troops, and Companies round about in Arms,
after a barbarous manner, celebrated <hi>Viriatus</hi> Memory; nor departed
they from the Pile, till the fire of it self went out. The Funeral Rites
performed, they set forth rewards for <hi>Gladiators.</hi> So great a desire of
him did <hi>Viriatus</hi> leave behind him, a man (as among the Barbarians)
most worthy of Command, behind none in encountring dangers, and the
most exact man living in dividing the Prey, for he never took nor offered
his friends more than their share, and himself distributed it to the Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
whereof this was the consequence (which is very rare, and I know
not whether ever it happened to any other General) that though he had
an Army composed of many divers Nations; yet in eight years, which
he waged War, no Mutiny every happened amongst them, but he had
always his Soldiers in a ready obedience, and forward in the encountring
of danger. Having created <hi>Tantalus</hi> General in the room of <hi>Viriatus,</hi>
they undertook the Expedition against <hi>Saguntum.</hi> This City <hi>Hannibal</hi>
having subversed, restored, and from his Countries name, called <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena.</hi>
The Spaniards repulsed thence, as they crossed over the River
<hi>Baetis, Cepio</hi> following pressed so hard upon them, that <hi>Tantalus</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusting
his Affairs, delivered up himself and his Army, upon Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they should be treated no worse than Subjects. So being disarmed,
that they might no more live like Thieves, they had sufficient Lands set
out to them: And thus ended the Viriatick War.</p>
               <p>Now let us return to the War with the <hi>Vacc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ei,</hi> or Numantines, whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XX"/>
                  <hi>Viriatus</hi> had engaged to a revolt, <hi>Caecilius Metell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> sent against these
with larger Forces, terrified and oppressed by his Expedition (for in the
height of their fear, he set upon them unawares) they were soon reduced.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65196:121"/>
There remained only two Towns, <hi>Termantia</hi> and <hi>Numantia,</hi> of which the
latter, by reason of its being surrounded, as it were, with two Rivers,
Valleys and extreme thick Woods, was of very difficult approach, there
was only one way to it by the Plain, and that fortified with Ditches
and Turn-pikes. The Numantines themselves excellent Soldiers, both on
Horseback and Foot, but not more than eight thousand, with which
number, though small, yet by reason of their signal Valour, they for a
long time vexed and tired the Romans. But Winter being past, <hi>Metellus</hi>
delivered over the Army admirably well exercised to <hi>Q. Pompeius Aulus,</hi>
being then thirty thousand Foot, and two thousand Horse. <hi>Pompey</hi> raising
his Camp from <hi>Numantia,</hi> whither to go I know not; the Numantines
making a Sally, oppressed some of his stragling Horse, whereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning,
drew up his Army in the Plain; the Numantines half flying, by
little and little retreated. At length <hi>Pompey</hi> seeing, that by reason of the
difficulties of the Turn-pikes, and Ditches, and the continual Execution of
light armed Numantines, his Army began to diminish, and waste insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
removed his Camp to <hi>Termantia,</hi> where he thought there was less to
do. Here likewise engaging with the Enemy, he lost seven hundred Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and the Military Tribunes bringing Provisions to the Camp, were by
the Numantines put flight, the same day in a third conflict, many Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Footmen and Horsemen, with their Horses being driven into rough
and craggy places, the rest stood in Arms all night without any sleep,
then at break of day the Enemy sallying out, they fought all day with
equal Fortune till night coming on parted them. Thence <hi>Pompey</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
towards a little Town, called <hi>Malia,</hi> held by a Garrison of the Numan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.
The Malians having by treachery slain the Garrison, delivered the
Town to <hi>Pompey,</hi> who disarming them, and taking their Hostages, he
marched to <hi>Sedetania,</hi> to deliver those people from the robberies of <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus,</hi>
a Captain of Thieves, him he overcame, and took many of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but so much gallantry of Spirit was found among Thieves, that none
of the Captains would submit to slavery, but some slew themselves, others,
those that bought, and some sunk the Ships, in which they were tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported:
<hi>Pompey</hi> returning to the Siege of <hi>Numantia,</hi> endeavoured to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the course of a certain River, that so he might subdue the City by
Famine; the Inhabitants making a silent Sally without Trumpets, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the work, and forcing the River upon those would have turned its
course, effectually did their business, repulsing all that came without
their Lines; and in short, confining the Romans to their Tents, whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
engaging as they went out to Forrage, they slew many, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
others <hi>Oppius,</hi> a Tribune of the Soldiers. And another party of the
Romans being throwing up a certain Ditch, they set upon them, and slew
forty with their Over-seer. About the same time came certain Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
from <hi>Rome,</hi> and a fresh Army of new raised men, who the old being
dismissed (for they had served six years in this War) supplyed their places.
<hi>Pompey</hi> ashamed of so many defeats, desirous to wash away the stain, lay
all Winter in his Tents. The Soldiers thus quartered under the open Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,
in a bitter cold Season, and having never before experienceed
inclemency of Air and Water, fell into Fluxes, of which several dyed.
And another part going out to Forrage, the Numantines having laid an
Ambush close to the Roman Camp, provoked the Romans to skirmish,
who not enduring to be dared, threw themselves without the Lines.
Then those in Ambush suddenly rising, many both of the Commons and
Nobility fell, and the Forragers coming in at the same time, they laid a
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:65196:121"/>
good parcel of them on the ground. <hi>Pompey</hi> grieved at so many losses,
retreats with his Counsellors into Towns, there to pass away the rest of
the Winter, till his Successor expected with the first of the Spring came:
but fearing to be called to account for the ill management of the War, he
had some private Conferences with the Numantines about putting an end
to it: The Numantines being themselves broken by the death of many
gallant Men, by their Fields lying fallow, by want of Provision, and the
unexpected durance of the War, were easily perswaded to send Agents to
<hi>Pompey</hi> to treat of Peace. He indeed publickly advised them to submit
themselves to the Romans discretion, (nor could he contrive any other
Conditions Honourable for the Roman People) but privately he taught
them what was to be done; when they were come to terms, and they
had yielded to the Romans, he demanded Hostages, Captives and Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways,
and had them delivered, and of thirty Talents of Silver, which
was agreed to be paid, the Numantines counted part to him, and part he
was to give time for. But it happened that when they had got together
the rest of the Money, and brought it to <hi>Pompey,</hi> his Successor <hi>M. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius
Laena</hi> was come. Wherefore being no more in fear of War now,
he had one to succeed him, knowing well that he had made a dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Peace, and that without any Orders from the People, he began to
deny he had any dealings with the Numantines; but they by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of many Senators, Commanders of Horse, and Military Tribunes;
easily convinced him. <hi>Popilius</hi> referred them to <hi>Rome,</hi> there to come to
a Trial with <hi>Pompey;</hi> the report being made to the Senate, they left
<hi>Pompey</hi> and the Numantines to contest with each other. Mean while the
Senate gave Orders to continue the War, and <hi>Popilius</hi> having done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else (till the coming of his Successor <hi>Attilius Mancinus)</hi> save lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Army into the Territory of the Lusones, neighbours to the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantines,
returned to <hi>Rome. Mancinus</hi> often engaging with the Numan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,
was always overcome; at length, with the loss of many, flying
into his Camp, upon a false rumour cast abroad, that the <hi>Cantabri</hi> and
<hi>Vaccaei</hi> were coming to the relief of the Numantines; growing fearful
in the dead of the night (all which he had spent without any Fires) flees
into a Desert place, where once was a Trench of <hi>Nobilior</hi>'s, in which
place, neither prepared nor fortified, being inclosed by break of day by
the Numantines, standing round about, and threatning death to all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he made Peace, he granted Conditions equal to the Numantines and
Romans, and bound himself to the performance, which when it was
brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> all men were exceedingly enraged at so base and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
a League, and sent one of the Consuls, <hi>Aemilius Lepidus</hi> into
<hi>Spain,</hi> recalling <hi>Mancinus</hi> (whom likewise the Numantine Legates fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed)
to show reasons for his Conduct. <hi>Aemilius</hi> while he stays for
an answer from the City, impatient of idleness, (for in these times men
sought not after Command for the Publick good, but either out of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Glory, or private gains, or hopes of the Honour of Triumph) he
falsly accused the <hi>Vaccaei,</hi> that in this War they had supplyed the Numan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
with Provisions. Whereupon he spoiled their Country, and laid
Siege to <hi>Palantia</hi> their chief City, which had not in the least title violated
their Covenants. Calling to him, and joyning with him in this work,
<hi>Brutus</hi> his Son-in-Law, who, as we have before mentioned, was sent into
the other part of <hi>Spain.</hi> To them <hi>Cinna</hi> and <hi>Caecilius</hi> coming Legates from
<hi>Rome,</hi> declared that the Senate was doubtful, whether after so many losses
it was convenient for <hi>Aemilius</hi> to engage in a new War, and to that end
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:65196:122"/>
they produced a Decree of the Senate, whereby <hi>Aemilius</hi> was forewarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not to make War with the <hi>Vaccaei.</hi> But he having already begun the
War, thinking the Senate were ignorant of many things, as first, that he
had joyned Forces with <hi>Brutus,</hi> then that the <hi>Vaccaei</hi> had assisted the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantines
with Men, Money and Provision, besides his retreat now might
make a strange alteration in Affairs, there being danger, lest thereupon
the Enemy contemning the Romans as fearful, all <hi>Spain</hi> should rebel. So
<hi>Cinna</hi> returned without doing any thing, only wrote thus much to <hi>Rome.</hi>
After these things, <hi>Aemilius</hi> took care in a well-fortified place, to cause
Machines to be built, and to lay in stores of Corn. <hi>Flaccus,</hi> who was
for that year Commissary General of Provisions, as he brought Victuals
to the Camp, fell into a manifest Ambush; from whence he freed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by this cunning, he spread a rumour among the Soldiers, that <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius</hi>
had taken <hi>Palantia;</hi> at the news of which his party beginning to
shout and rejoyce, the Barbarians hearing them, and believing it to be so
indeed, of their own accord drew off: by this policy <hi>Flaccus</hi> saved his
Provision from the Enemy. But the Siege of <hi>Palantia</hi> being still prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and food failing, Famine began sorely to afflict the Romans, for not
only all the Cattel, but many men died. Indeed the Generals, <hi>Aemilius</hi>
and <hi>Brutus</hi> long bore out against these misfortunes, bravely and constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but at length compelled to yield to them, about the last watch of the
night, they gave Orders to Discamp; and the Military Tribunes and
Primipiles running up and down, urged every one to get ready to march
by the first Light, so that doing all things in a hurry, they forsook their
sick and wounded men, hanging upon them, and beseeching them not to
betray them: In such confusion they marched away, that it could only
be said, they did not flee; the Palantines several times falling on them,
and keeping close up to them from morning till it was night, and doing
them much detriment. As soon as it was dark, the Romans spent by
hunger and travel, dispersed themselves by Companies about the Fields,
and the Palantines, some Deity turning them back, went home. The
Romans, for this ill management, depriving <hi>Aemilius</hi> of his Consulate
and Command, fined him besides in a sum of Money. The cause likewise
between <hi>Mancinus,</hi> and the Numantine Legates was heard in Senate;
these alledging their League with <hi>Mancinus,</hi> he transferring the fault
upon <hi>Pompey,</hi> the former General, who had delivered over to him a
vicious and unwarlike Army, which was therefore often overcome, and
that he himself had likewise made Peace with the Numantines; he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
added, that it was no wonder, if this War had no good success,
which they had against all Justice decreed. Though the Fathers were
equally angry with them both, yet <hi>Pompey,</hi> against whom there had
been a former sentence given, came off: But <hi>Mancinus,</hi> for being Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of so base a Peace without their Orders, they condemned to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
up to the Numantines, after the Example of those Fathers, who
once gave up naked to the Samnites twenty Generals, who without
their Command had concluded a League. <hi>Mancinus</hi> being brought to
<hi>Spain,</hi> was by <hi>Furius,</hi> in like manner, yielded up naked to the Numan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,
but they refused to accept him. Against them <hi>Calphurnius Piso</hi>
was next chosen General, who brought not his Army against <hi>Numantia;</hi>
but entring the confines of the Palantines, returned thence with an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
booty, and the rest of the time of his Government, spent in
Winters Quarters in <hi>Capertania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:65196:122"/>
The People of <hi>Rome</hi> offended at this Numantine War, which in all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXI"/>
Mens judgement was yet like to be more tedious, and difficult, decreed
the other Consulate to <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> newly come from <hi>Carthage,</hi> for
they believed him the only Man by whom the Numantines could be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.
But being under the Consulary Age, appointed by the Law made
in the Carthaginian War, by the Tribunes of the People, they now repealed
that Law, and the next year again confirmed it. Thus <hi>Scipio</hi> being
again declared Consul hastned to <hi>Numantia</hi> with no Army, the City
Forces being wasted by so many Wars, and there being strength enough
in <hi>Spain.</hi> Yet by the Senates permission he carried some Voluntiers from
other Cities, and Kings, who out of particular Friendship went with
him, to whom he added about five hundred Clients and Friends out of
the City, whom listing in one Band he called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, the
Band of Friends, all these amounting to about four thousand he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the leading of <hi>Buteo</hi> his Nephew, he himself slenderly accompanied
went before to the Army in <hi>Spain,</hi> whom he was informed were debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with all manner of Idleness, Discord and Luxury. Wherefore
knowing well enough he could never overcome his Enemies, unless he
first throughly purged and suppressed the Vices of his Army, as soon
as he came to the Camp, he thought nothing more fitting then to expel
thence all Hucksters, Whores, and Southsaying Priests, to which last the
Soldiers, dismayed with so many unfortunate Engagements, were but too
much addicted, forbidding for the future, the bringing any thing not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary into the Camp, and strictly prohibiting all Sacrifices for
Divination, sending away all Waggons of useless Baggage, and all Cattle,
but such as they could by no means be without. Nor was any one to have
more Utensils for dressing meat then a Spit, a Brass Pot, and one Cup.
Meats likewise were prescribed Boild and Roasted, Beds forbidden, and
for Example himself first lay in a Hamock, he forbid the Riding upon
Mules upon a March, for what hopes was there of their service in War
who could not walk on Foot; he likewise reproved those had servants to
anoint and bath them, jestingly telling them Mules which had no
hands wanted others to scrub and scratch them: by these means he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
them all to temperance. He accustomed them likewise to a Fear
and Reverence of his Person, making the access to him, difficult in any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
Petitions, having always these sayings in his mouth, <hi>That those Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
who were strict and severe observers of Laws, were serviceable to their
friends, but those who were easie and greedy of gain, only profitable to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
That the Armies of these might indeed be more merry, but ignorant of
order and obedience; but those more grave, and withal more dutiful and ready upon
all occasion of service.</hi> Nor would he at all engage the Enemy till he had
first excerised his Soldiers in a thousand sundry labors, daily removing about
the Country, he caused to be fortified new Camps, and then demolished
them, deep ditches to be dug, and then filled up, mighty Walls to be
Built, and then pulled down again, himself from Morning till Evening,
going about and overseeing what was done. And that none upon a march
(as had formerly been used) might straggle from the Army, he alway
drew up in a square body, and when it moved, kept himself in continual
motion from Front to Rear, nor was it lawful for any to shift the place as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
him by the General. In the midst, as in the most proper place, he
posted the sick and weak, commanding the Horsemen to dismount, and
set them upon their Horses: the beasts of burthen that were heaviest la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
he divided among the Foot: And where he intended to lodge those
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65196:123"/>
designed for the guard of the Lines that night he commanded to stay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
at their Arms, and kept a party of Horse scouting abroad for disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
but to the rest of the Soldiers he appointed every one their task,
these to dig in the Tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pitch the Tents, and set a certain and definitive space of time, in which
every thing was to be done. And when he had brought his Army into
a due posture of obedience, and made them patient of labor, then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
his Camp nearer to <hi>Numantia.</hi> Where, according as some had
used to do, he posted them not in Castles, for he would not presently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
his Army, nor run the hazard of a loss at first, thereby to make them
run more into Contempt, with the Enemy, who contemned them enough
already. Nor did he think it convenient to engage them in Battel, till he
saw both good reason and opportunity for the doing it, and had throughly
searched into the Numantines Counsels and Designs. In the mean time
he wasted all the fields behind his Camp, and from thence fetcht in all
his Forrage and cut down the standing Corn, which done, and that he
was in a readiness to proceed farther, his Friends advising him, that by a
nearer way through the Field he might go forward to <hi>Numantia, but I,</hi>
said he, <hi>fear my return, the Enemy naked, and nimble Sallying out of the
City have again into the City a retreat, but ours returning from forrage are
laden with prey, and tyred, besides they bring with them Loaden Cattle, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
and Baggage; and that would be a hard and unequal fight, where being
overcome they must run much danger and being Victorious yet, but little praise
or profit, it being the height of madness to run into danger, for things of no
moment. Nor was he worth the Name of a General, who unless compelled
would throw the Dice of War, but he on the contrary who when necessity required
and opportunity offered, would undantedly throw himself upon all dangers;</hi> Adding
hereunto this similitude, <hi>that Chirurgions used not to incise or cauterize be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they applyed Medicaments.</hi> These things said, he Commanded his
Colonels to lead the Army the farther way about, then making some
Excursions beyond the Camp, he came among the <hi>Vaccaei,</hi> from whom
the Numantines bought their Provisions, there preying upon all whatever
was useful for the subsistence of the Camp, they gathered and brought
away, the rest heaped together and burnt. In the Country of the Palan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines
was a place called <hi>Caplanium;</hi> there the <hi>Palatini,</hi> upon a certain hill
laid Ambush, and with another party openly provoked <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Forragers.
<hi>Scipio</hi> Commands <hi>Rutilius Rufus,</hi> who was then Military Tribune (and
hath likewise writ a History of these things) that taking four Troops of
Horse he should break the Enemies charge. <hi>Rufus,</hi> they giving ground,
pressed on too immoderately, so that mixing with the flyers, they were got
together to the hill, where when he discovered the Ambush, he gave ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to his Horsemen not to think of following or pressing forward, but
keeping their ground and order with their Lances at full length to keep off
the Enemy: But <hi>Scipio</hi> who yet a great way off, had perceived that <hi>Rufus</hi>
had already run beyond his Orders, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ollicitous of the event, immediately
followed and found himself likewise taken in the snare; wherefore he
commanded they should both ways charge the Enemy, and having thrown
their Javelins, make their retreat not all in a huddle, but by degrees and
keeping their Ranks, and by this means he brought his Horse off safely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the plain. Afterwards knowing for certain that near the passage of a
River whose Ford was troublesome and Muddy they had laid another trap
for him, he drew off, by a way farther indeed about, but not so fit for
Ambushes. And because of the heat of the weather marching by night,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65196:123"/>
sinking several Wells, he found the waters of many of them bitter, so
that thence though very hardly the Men got safely off, but some of the
Horses and Cattel died with thirst. As he passed through the Country of
the <hi>Caucaei,</hi> whom <hi>Lucullus</hi> had with so much treachery abused, he caused
Proclamation to be made that the <hi>Caucaei</hi> might with al safety return to
their habitations, thence he went and wintred on the Confines of the
Numantines, whither <hi>Iugurtha</hi> Nephew to <hi>Massanissa</hi> came to him out
of <hi>Africa</hi> with twelve Elephants, fitted with Archers and Slingers to gaul
the Enemy in Front. In these places by frequent incursions, wasting and
forraging the Country the Enemy laid close Ambush for him. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
of the place prompted them to the design. There was a Town
almost quite encompassed round with a slimy Marsh, but only on one side
where there was a Valley, and in that Valley the Ambush lay hid; <hi>Scipio's</hi>
Soldiers were so divided that part entred the Town, began to Plunder,
others kept about on horse back, whom those from the Ambush rising up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
easily routed. <hi>Scipio</hi> who by chance stood without the Village near
the Colours, commanded back by sound of Trumpet those got into the
houses, and first with about a thousand running in to the relief of the
baggage horses, and many out of the Town coming to joyn with him,
he forced the Enemy to turn their backs but not following at all
the chase, retreated himself into his Trenches with the loss but of few on
both sides.</p>
               <p>Not long after having pitched two Camps near <hi>Numantia</hi> (one of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXII"/>
which he committed to the care of his brother <hi>Maximus,</hi> and the other
commanded himself) when the Numantines drawing out, often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
the Romans to fight, he scorned and laughed at them, saying, it
would redound much to his dishonor if he should chuse rather to fight
then reduce by famine men made furious by utter despair, therefore to
besiege them the closer he drew seven Ditches round the City, and sent
Letters to his Friends signifying how many and what forces they should
send to him, which when they came he divided into several parts, and
soon after divided his whole Forces into several bodies, appointing each
their Leaders, and Commanding them to inclose the City with a Trench
and Pallisadoes. The Circuit of <hi>Numantia</hi> was twenty four Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs,
but that of his Trench above twice as much. Now every
party had their distinct work set out to them, with orders that if
the Enemy made any onset, they should give the signal by day a red cloth
hanging on a long spear, and by night fire, that forthwith he or <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
his brother might run in to their help. The work being brought to
that forwardness that if the Enemy attempted any thing they might repulse
him, he dug another ditch without that, and fastning thereon Palisadoes,
built a Wall eight foot thick, and ten foot high below the battlements
round which he raised Towers, at one hundred and twenty foot distance
from each other, and because he could not run the Wall over the marsh, he
threw up a bank in height and breadth equal to it, which served instead
of a Wall, and <hi>Scipio</hi> is in my Judgment, the first that ever begirt a City,
not refusing to fight him, with a Wall. But besides all this the River
<hi>Durius</hi> running through his Fortifications was very convenient for the
Townsmen, as well to bring them what they wanted, as for the transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Men, whether by swimming, or in little Boats, in which they pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
stole by the Romans, either with Sails, the wind blowing fresh;
or which Oars down the Stream. When therefore by reason of the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65196:124"/>
and violence of the Waters no way could be found to make a Bridge
over, instead thereof he built two Castles, from which he drew over
<note n="*" place="margin">Scipio's <hi>Boom.</hi>
                  </note> Beams of Timber fastned together with Cordage, quite athwart the
River, there were likewise very thick upon the Timbers, fastned very
sharp Irons like Spear-heads, which move about by the force of the Water
suffered none to pass, who either by Swimming or Diving, or Boat had
design to deceive the Enemy: For it was <hi>Scipio</hi>'s chief desire that none co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to them from abroad they might be ignorant of all was done, and
want both intelligence and supplies. After all the works were perfected,
and the Catapults, Crossbows and other Engins raised upon the Towers
and the Bulwarks, well stored with Stones, Darts and Javelins, and the
Archers and Slingers placed in the Towers, he disposed messengers quite
round the Lines, who taking the word from one another might give it
about, as any thing hapned, he gave order likewise, that the first Tower
that was assaulted by the Enemy should first show their Colours, and then
others by the same Example do the like, that by the moving of this sign,
and the word going about by the messengers he might know the certain
cause of every thing; Then Mustring his forces and finding he had sixty
thousand men, he so divided them, that one half had charge of the guard
of the wall, and if need were might be ready for other service, twenty
thousand upon occasion to fight for the wall, and ten thousand for their
reserve, who had likewise their post assigned them; but none without
the Generals Command was to change his Post, so that upon any signal
given, every man was ready at his stand: with so much diligence did <hi>Scipio</hi>
order all things. In the mean time the Numantines made several assaults
upon the guards of the Wall, but then immediately, not without horror,
they beheld assistance come from all parts, the signals made, the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
running, those appointed for defence of the Walls leaping up, the
Trumpets from the Towers sounding a charge, so that in an instant, all
that whole circuit of fifty furlongs was put into a formidable posture.
The whole round of which <hi>Scipio</hi> continually went both day and night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
his Enemies thus inclosed and wanting both Provisions, Arms and
Men, could not very long make opposition. In the mean time <hi>Retogenes</hi> a most
valiant Numantine, whose Surname was <hi>Cauraunius,</hi> taking with him five
friends whom he had wrought his parties in the enterprise, as many ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and a like number of Horses in a cloudy and very dark night pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
closely over the space between the Town and the Trenches, with a
little Bridge to be set together, that he brought with him, gets with his
friends upon the Enemies Works, and having slain the Sentinels, drew over
the Horses by the same Bridge, and sending back the servants, they forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
dispersed themselves among the Towns of the <hi>Arvacci,</hi> and in the
manner of suppliants with Olive-branches in their hands, besought them
to assist their kinsfolks the Numantines; but many out of fear of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
without hearing them commanded them to depart their Territories.
But the youth of <hi>Lutia</hi> (a rich Town about three hundred furlongs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from <hi>Numantia)</hi> pittying the Numantines condition, urged their
City to send them aid, whereof <hi>Scipio</hi> having certain intelligence from the
Seniors of the City, taking with him a nimble party, in eight hours time
flies to <hi>Lutia,</hi> and by break of day begirting the City commanded the
heads and ringleaders of the youth to be delivered up to him, and when
they made answer, that they were broken out and fled, threatned by a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald
to Sack the City unless they were delivered up, wherewith terrified
they brought out about forty to him, whose hands having cut off he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65196:124"/>
away with his Forces, and by the next morning again recovered his
Camp.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Numantines oppressed with hunger, sent five men to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIII"/>
                  <hi>Scipio,</hi> to try whether if they yielded, they might be received with favour
and clemency; the chief of this Deputation called <hi>Avarus,</hi> began to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
in a brave and lofty manner, of the Institutions and Valour of the
Numantines; adding, they had not been guilty of any delinquency, since
only for their Wives and Childrens sakes, and the Liberty of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
they were fallen into these miseries. <hi>Wherefore it would be an action
worthy thee, O</hi> Scipio (said he) <hi>who art famed for a man of admirable gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity,
to spare a brave and worthy people like ours, and not impose harder
Conditions than humanity is able to bear on men, who sadly experienced the
change of Fortune; for it is no more in our powers, but thine, by proposing
moderate Conditions to save our City, by accepting our surrender, or else by
fighting to suffer us utterly to perish. Avarus</hi> having thus spoken, <hi>Scipio</hi>
(before well assured of the Cities distress by the Captives) made no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
answer, but that they must deliver up the City and their Arms;
which being told to the Numantines, the Citizens already enough enraged
(as men that were resolute to enjoy their Liberty, and submit to no others
Empire) now by these provoking miseries made more violent and fierce,
slew <hi>Avarus,</hi> and his fellow Deputies, as the Messengers of ill News,
and perhaps, as suspecting them to have made some private bargain for
their own safety. Not long after all manner of food being spent, and
neither Corn, nor Cattell, nor Herbs left, first (as in close sieges has often
happened) they fed upon boiled Hides; which being likewise consumed,
they minced small the flesh of dying men, and devoured it, but their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
soon loathing the flesh of these sick men, the stronger began to lay
hands upon the weaker. In short, there was no misery to be imagined
which they did not endure; their minds made fierce and bloody by this
food, and their bodies oppressed with hunger and plague; having long
time neglected themselves, they grew rough and shaggy, and in all points
resembled wild Beasts. In this lamentable condition they delivered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up to <hi>Scipio;</hi> by whose Command they one day brought all their
Arms into one place, and were appointed on the next day to assemble
themselves in another; but they thought that day long; many yet out of
desire of Liberty, professing they wished for death, and on that day only ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for some kind of death to be appointed them; so much Love of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
was there in a small and a barbarous City; for when before the
War they were but eight thousand, with how frequent slaughters did they
afflict the Romans? How often upon good terms did they enter into
Leagues, which the Romans would not afterwards ratifie or maintain? How
often did they provoke to Battel this last Roman General, besieging them
with threescore thousand men? But he had so much knowledge in Military
Affairs, that he would not engage in fight with wild Beasts, but chose
rather to reduce them by Famine, the only way to tame those creatures,
and by which they at last were tamed and broken. Wherefore when I
considered, that the Numantines with so few Soldiers, so constantly held
out so lasting a Siege, I thought it would have been a crime to have past
by the particulars of it in silence. Surrendry being therefore made, many
of them slew themselves in what manner they best thought fit; the rest
assembled on the third day in the place appointed, with Bodies like Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cases,
a bruitish kind of Countenance, their Bodies covered with filth and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65196:125"/>
nastiness, their Hair shaggy, their Garments foul, tattered and loathsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stinking; so that in that condition they appeared miserable to their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Enemies, though the sick struck horror into all that looked upon them;
for with anger, grief and labour, and a mutual consciousness of having
fed on Humane Flesh, their very Eyes looked fiery and bloody. Fifty
of them only reserved for his Triumph, <hi>Scipio</hi> sold the rest under the yoke.
The Town he levelled with the ground. Thus this Roman General sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
two famous Cities. <hi>Carthage</hi> by Decree of the Senate (lest the
power and strength of the City and Empire, and conveniency of its Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
should invite them to War) and <hi>Numantia,</hi> a small one, and not
very populous, without so much as the peoples knowledge; whether he
believed it the sense of the Commonwealth, whether out of a sudden rage
and anger against those people; or rather (as many think) to gain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
two Illustrious Sirnames from the ruines of the two Cities; for even
to this day the Romans call him, the African and the Numantine, from the
destruction and ruine of those two Cities. Having divided the Lands of
the Numantines among the Neighbours, and gone a progress through
the other Cities to administer Justice, and threatned or fined those
which had any way been their Associates, he returned home.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIV"/> The Romans according to Custom sent ten Senators to those people,
whom either <hi>Scipio</hi> now, or <hi>Brutus</hi> before, had subdued either by sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendry,
or force of Arms, to establish Order, and settle all Affairs in
Peace. In succeeding times, new stirs arising, <hi>Calphurnius Piso</hi> was sent
thither General, whom <hi>Servilius Galba</hi> succeeded. But when <hi>Italy</hi> was
oppressed with the Cimbrian War, and <hi>Sicily</hi> again with that of the
Slaves; they sent no Forces into <hi>Spain,</hi> but only Lieutenants, who as far
as they were able, kept all things in quiet. The Cimbrians being driven
out of <hi>Italy, T. Didius</hi> coming thither, slew twenty thousand of the
<hi>Vaccaei,</hi> and transplanted the Town of <hi>Tremisum,</hi> always unfaithful to the
Romans, from a strong situation unto the Plain, commanding the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
to live without any Fortifications. Then after seven Months Siege
he took the City <hi>Colenda</hi> by surrendry, and sold all the Citizens with their
Wives and Children. Not far from <hi>Colenda</hi> dwelt a mixture of several
people of the Celtiberians, whom <hi>Marius,</hi> five years before, when he had
made use of them against the Lusitanians, had by consent of the Senate
there appointed Habitations. These through want, living on thievery,
<hi>Didius,</hi> by consent of the ten Commissioners, who were not yet gone,
approved the settlement and signified to their Leaders, that he would to
those wanted, assign the Lands of the Inhabitants of <hi>Colenda,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
they eagerly accepting, he presently commanded them with
their Wives and Children to come to the division of the Land: when they
were come, he commanded his Soldiers to come out of his Camp, and
them to go in, the men apart from the Women and Children, for that
he would take a Roll of their Names, to compute how much Land was to
be divided. They being all gone within the Lines; the Soldiers surround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them, put them all to the Sword, for which things he likewise tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed.
The Celtiberians again rebelling: <hi>Flaccus</hi> was sent against
them, who with the slaughter of twenty thousand suppressed them. But
in the City of <hi>Belgeda,</hi> the people inclining to a defection, and the Senate
demurring upon it, and refusing, the people burnt them all in their
Seats, of which Villany, <hi>Flaccus</hi> at his coming finding out the Authors pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
them. These are the Actions of the Romans against the Spaniards,
which I have found most worthy of Memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:65196:125"/>
In latter time when <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Cinna,</hi> being at variance raised Arms
and conspired aginst their Country, <hi>Q. Sertorius</hi> being of <hi>Cinna</hi>'s party
and chosen General of <hi>Spain,</hi> stirred up that whole Province against the
Romans, and having got together a mighty Army, and formed a kind of
a Senate out of his Friends, with great courage and confidence was about
to march towards the City. At which the Fathers terrified, they sent two
Excellent and famous Generals of their own order <hi>Caecilius Metellus,</hi> with
one strong Army, and <hi>Cn. Pompey</hi> with another, to divert him from <hi>Italy;</hi>
yet laboring for strength after the late Civil War. But <hi>Perpenna</hi> one of
<hi>Sertorius</hi> party slew him and made himself General of the Faction, who
being by <hi>Pompey</hi> overcome in battel and slain, that War which had struck
a great terror among the Romans, was ended: but of this we have written
more accurately in <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Civil Wars. After <hi>Sylla</hi>'s death, <hi>C. Caesar</hi> was
created General in <hi>Spain</hi> with power to make War as he should think fit
against any that seemed to stagger, or were never yet subdued to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Power. After him <hi>Octavius Caesar</hi> Son of <hi>Caius,</hi> Surnamed <hi>Augustus,</hi>
reduced some people which had again rebelled, from which time the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
(as I suppose) divided <hi>Iberia</hi> which they now call <hi>Spain</hi> into
<note n="*" place="margin">Terraconen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, Boetica, Lusitania.</note> three parts, sending Praetors into each of them, two of which are nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
by the Senate, and the third appointed by the Emperor.</p>

of <hi>Spain</hi> he led his Forces into <hi>Italy,</hi> during the full sixteen
years that he there continued in Arms, acting, and in his
turn suffering all the extremities of War; till by his fellow
Citizens (his own Country being in jeopardy) he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called,
and by the Romans driven out of <hi>Italy,</hi> shall be the Subject of this
Book; and though the causes, both of the breaking out, and of the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on this War into <hi>Italy,</hi> as well what in reality they were, as what was
openly pretended, be in the Spanish History most accurately declared;
yet it will not be amiss for the refreshing the Readers Memory, to make
some short rehearsal. <hi>Amilcar,</hi> sirnamed <hi>Barcas,</hi> Father of this <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
in that War waged between the Romans and Carthaginians in <hi>Sicily,</hi> was
General of the Carthaginian Forces; and being for his ill Conduct accused
by his Enemies, and thereof doubtful, he so managed Affairs, that before
rendring any account of his former charge, he was created General a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Numidians. In which War, because he much advanced the
Commonwealth, and by Gifts and Rapines pleased that Army, he was
first sent by the Carthaginian people to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> whence crossing over
that Strait into <hi>Spain,</hi> by sending many rich Presents out of the Spoil of
that Country into <hi>Carthage,</hi> he reconciled himself to the people, striving
by all means to wipe off the Memory of the Sicilian Ignominy. At
length having subdued many People, and got great Glory, he drew on
the Carthaginians, with a hope and desire of possessing all <hi>Spain,</hi> as a
thing easily effected; whereupon the Saguntines, and other Greeks, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting
<hi>Spain,</hi> sought for refuge to the Romans: Whereupon it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
between the Romans and Carthaginians, and ratified by Writings,
that the Bounds of the Carthaginian Dominion should be the River <hi>Ibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus.</hi>
After which <hi>Barcas</hi> setling in <hi>Spain</hi> the Affairs of the subdued Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
was in a certain Battel slain; and <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> the Son-in-Law of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi>
substituted in his place, who being likewise (as he was hunting)
killed by a Slave, whose Master he had put to death; the third from
them, who for his skill in, and love of warlike Affairs, was chosen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
by the Army; was this <hi>Hannibal,</hi> the Son of <hi>Barcas,</hi> and Brother
to <hi>Asdrubal's</hi> Wife, a young man indeed: but who had lived all his time
with his Father or Brother-in-Law; and having now the Command gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by the Soldiery, the Carthaginian people approved it; and so this
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> of whom I am about to write, was declared General for the
Carthaginians against the Spaniards; who perceiving his Fathers friends
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65196:127"/>
exposed to the designs and malice of their Enemies, who despising his
Youth, began to set things on foot against them, not being ignorant, but
their dangers would one day fall upon his own head. That out of the
publick fear he might acquire and establish freedom and security for
himself; he devised how to embroil his Country in a War, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
none more fit for his purpose, more lasting, nor likely to be more
for his Glory, than a War with the Romans; the very attempting which,
though he succeeded ill, would get him no small Renown (to omit the
report spread abroad, that when a Boy, his Father made him swear at
the Altar, never to be at peace with the Romans) he resolved, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the League, to cross over the <hi>Iberus,</hi> which he thus found oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to effect: He set on some to accuse the Saguntines, and plied the
Senate with frequent Letters; alledging that the Romans solicited all <hi>Spain</hi>
to revolt; till at length he obtained leave to deal with the Saguntines, as
he himself thought fit: so he crossed the <hi>Iberus,</hi> and utterly rased the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Saguntines. Thus were all the Leagues made between the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
and Carthaginians, since the Sicilian War, utterly broken.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> But what <hi>Hannibal</hi> and others, either Carthaginian or Roman Generals,
did in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Spanish History declares: He gathering together vast
multitudes of Africans, Celtiberians, and many other Nations, delivering
over <hi>Spain</hi> to his Brother <hi>Asdrubal,</hi> and climbing over the Pyrenean Hills,
came into <hi>Celtica,</hi> which is now called <hi>Gallica,</hi> leading with him ninety
thousand Footmen, twelve thousand Horse, and seven and thirty Elephants,
and joyning to him some Gauls, partly gained by Gold, partly by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and partly by Force, lead them along with him: whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
on his March, when he came to the <hi>Alpes,</hi> though he saw no
ascent nor passage (for all before him seemed craggy and inaccessible)
yet with a strange confidence of mind, which no labour could make
bend, he setled himself to go forward; and finding all the passages stop'd
with deep Snow, and Ice congealed together, thawing it by kindling mighty
Fires, and quenching the Ashes with Water and Vinegar, and then break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the scorched and cleaving Rocks with Iron Hammers and Wedges,
by little and little lessened them, and opened himself a way, which to
this day lyes so, and is called <hi>Hannibals</hi> passage. But when hunger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to afflict his Army, he with more speed lead them on, whilst none
yet knew of his coming into <hi>Italy.</hi> After six Months spent after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from <hi>Spain,</hi> with great difficulty and the loss of many men, he
in the end got down from the Mountains into the Plain; where giving his
Army some short rest, he went and took <hi>Turine,</hi> a City of the Gauls, which
being gained by storm, and the Captives (to strike a terrour into the rest
of the Gauls) all slain, he marched his Army to the <hi>Eridanus</hi> (now called
<hi>Po)</hi> whereabouts the Romans, at that time waged War against the Boian
Gauls. <hi>P. Cornelius Scipio,</hi> the Roman Consul, then sent to wage War
against the Carthaginians in <hi>Spain,</hi> hearing of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s being gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Italy;</hi> leaving <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Command of that Army to his Brother
<hi>Cn. Scipio,</hi> sailed into<note n="*" place="margin">Tuscany.</note> 
                  <hi>Hetruria;</hi> from whence making haste, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
together all the force he could, he got to the <hi>Po</hi> before <hi>Hannibal</hi>
passed it; and sending <hi>Manlius</hi> and <hi>Attilius,</hi> who commanded in the War
against the Boians to <hi>Rome</hi> (for the Consuls being present, their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was at an end) and joyning their Forces with his, drew up his Army
to give Battel to <hi>Hannibal.</hi> The Fight being begun by the light armed
Darters and Horsemen, the Romans circumvented by the Africans, fled
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65196:127"/>
to their Tents, and next night having first broke down the Bridge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the <hi>Po,</hi> retreated to <hi>Placentia,</hi> a place well fortified; but <hi>Hannibal</hi>
making a new Bridge, brought his Army likewise over. These brave
Exploits, after his coming down from the <hi>Alpes</hi> into the Plain, stood him
not in little stead among the Transalpine Gauls, who thought him an
invincible Leader, and a man to all whose attempts Fortune showed her
self favourable and propitious; which Renown to increase among these
Barbarians already astonished, with admiration of him, and therefore
easily to be deceived; he often changed his Habit and Hair, which dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was by some new Artifice prepared and coloured, so that passing
through their Country, he sometimes appeared like an old, sometimes
like a young, and sometimes like a middle aged man; so that seeing
him continually varying from himself, they forthwith judged Divine
Nature to be in him. <hi>Sempronius,</hi> the other Consul, who was then in
<hi>Sicily,</hi> having certain intelligence of these things, came to <hi>Scipio</hi> by Sea,
and sets down within forty Furlongs of his Colleague; and now all
things were prepared for the next days Battel. Only the River <hi>Trebia</hi>
ran between, which the Romans before it was light on a cold and mizling
Winters Morning, passed over almost up to the breast in Water, whilst
<hi>Hannibal</hi> till the second hour refreshed his Solders in their Tents. The
two Consuls so drew up their Army, that they might be on the Wings,
placing the stoutest of their Foot in the main Body. <hi>Hannibal</hi> opposed
his Elephants to the Horse, and his Foot to the Phalanx, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Horse to stand still behind the Elephants, till he gave them the
Signal. The Battels being joyned, the Romans Horse affrighted with the
sight and smell of the Elephants, to which they were unaccustomed,
dispersed all abroad and fled; but the Foot, though stiff with cold, soak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Water, and tired and broken with continual watchings, yet with
couragious hearts flew upon those Monsters, and cutting them cross the
Nerves, wounded them, and had doubtless put to flight his Foot, had
not <hi>Hannibal,</hi> giving his Signal to his Horsemen, sent them to flank
the Enemy: For then the Roman Foot left naked by their Horse, whom
the terrour of the Elephants had scattered, and oppressed by multitudes,
fearing to be inclosed by their Enemies, took a speedy flight towards
their Camp. Then were many of the Foot intercepted by the Horse,
and others that reached the River, (which was not a little swell'd with
the Snow melted by the heat of the Sun) were swallowed in the
Stream, the depth of the Water not giving them foothold, nor their
heavy Armour suffering them to swim. <hi>Scipio</hi> following them, and
still encouraging his Soldiers, was very near slain, and desperately
wounded, brought with much difficulty to <hi>Cremona.</hi> Near <hi>Placentia</hi>
was a little Castle, which <hi>Hannibal</hi> going to storm, with the loss of
forty of his men, went off himself wounded. After which both Armies
betook themselves to Winter Quarters, <hi>Scipio</hi> in <hi>Cremona</hi> and <hi>Palantia,</hi>
and <hi>Hannibal</hi> about the <hi>Po.</hi> The Romans hearing of this defeat given
near the <hi>Po</hi> (for before <hi>Hannibals</hi> coming they had been worsted by the
Boians) enrolled a new Army in the City, which accounting those at the
<hi>Po,</hi> compleated thirteen Legions, and twice as many they commanded
from their Allies. Some of these they thought fit to send into <hi>Spain,</hi>
fome to <hi>Sardinia</hi> (for there they were at War too) and fome into <hi>Sicily</hi>
the greater part which were left behind the Consuls <hi>Cn. Servilius,</hi> and
<hi>Flaminius</hi> (who succeeded <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Sempronius)</hi> led against <hi>Hannibal,</hi>
and <hi>Scipio</hi> as Proconsul sailed into <hi>Spain. Flaminius</hi> with thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65196:128"/>
Foot, and three thousand Horse had the Guard of <hi>Italy,</hi> within the
<hi>Appennine,</hi> which alone is properly called <hi>Italy;</hi> for the <hi>Appennine</hi> from
the middle of the <hi>Alpes</hi> stretches it self to the Sea; on the right hand of
which lyes that part, which is truly called <hi>Italy;</hi> that on the left hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Ionian Sea now indeed is <hi>Italy</hi> (for <hi>Hetruria</hi> is now likewise
<hi>Italy)</hi> but part of it towards the Ionian Sea Coasts is inhabited by Greeks,
and part by Gauls, who once making War upon the Romans, burnt the
City; and whom <hi>Camillus</hi> pursuing to the <hi>Appennine;</hi> I am of the opinion,
that crossing those Hills, they then seated themselves upon the Ionian Sea,
and made that their Country, whence part of that Region is to this day
called the Italian Gaul. But to proceed, the Romans having now at
the same time many powerful Armies in several places, <hi>Hannibal</hi>
having thereof intelligence, very secretly upon the first approach of the
Spring, entred <hi>Hetruria,</hi> wasting that whole Country, and drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the City, struck a mighty terrour in the Romans, who had now
no Army there to oppose him; yet of those that remained, they levyed
eight thousand men, whom for want of other Magistrates, they gave
<hi>Centenius</hi> the Command of, a private man indeed, but of the Patritian
Race, and sent him into <hi>Umbria</hi> to the <hi>Plestine</hi> Marsh to guard that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
which was the nearest way to the City. In the mean time <hi>Flami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
who with thirty thousand men kept the interior <hi>Italy,</hi> hearing
of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s celcrity; and being afraid of the City, forthwith removes
his Camp; and giving his Army no rest, being a man ignorant of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Affairs; and who by pride and popular boasting came to be chosen
to this Command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by great journies hastens towards <hi>Hannibal,</hi> with
resolution to fight him as soon as possible. <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who knew the
mans furious temper, and unskilfulness in War, pitch'd his Tents
behind a certain Mountain and Marsh, and hid all his Horse and
Light Armed Men in the Valley. In the Morning at break of day,
<hi>Flaminius</hi> seeing the Enemies Tents, stayed there a small while to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
his Army, and threw up a Trench; which done, he drew up his
Army in Battel, before they had yet recovered strength, after so much
labour and watching: but when the Ambushes rose upon them on all
sides,
then penn'd in between the Mountains and the Lake, and on both
sides charged by their Enemies; the Consul himself, and twenty thousand
with him were slain. The remaining ten thousand, who had fled to a
certain Village, fortified by Nature, <hi>Maharbal,</hi> one of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
who had himself gained great Renown in War, seeing he
could not easily vanquish them by force, and thinking it not prudence to
engage with desperate men, perswaded them to lay down their Arms,
engaging upon his Honour, they should all have free leave to go whither
they pleased. They having thereupon laid down their Arms, he carried
them naked to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who denying that <hi>Maharbal</hi> had any power
without his Orders to promise any thing, such of the Associates as he
found, he treated with all kindness, and dismissed without any ransom,
by this Clemency, enticing and alluring the Cities to his party,
but all the Romans he kept Prisoners. Among the Auxiliary Gauls,
that by gain he might sweeten them, he likewise divided part of the prey,
and then began to march on.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> The Fame of these things coming to <hi>Servilius</hi> the Consul, who lay in
his standing Camp near the <hi>Po,</hi> he with forty thousand men made haste
towards <hi>Hetruria. Centenius</hi> still with his eight thousand men kept his
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65196:128"/>
Post. <hi>Hannibal</hi> viewing the Plestine Marsh, and the Mountain hanging
over it, and <hi>Centenius</hi> guarding the Passage, diligently enquired of the
Chief of his Guards, if there were any way to go about the Mountain;
and though they told him they were no way passible, but all was rough
and craggy; yet he commanded <hi>Maharbal,</hi> with some Light Armed
Men to fetch a compass about the Mountain, and about the same time
that he conjectured he might have recovered the tops of the Hills, charged
<hi>Centenius</hi> in Front; and whilst they were disputing it, <hi>Maharbal</hi> having
stoutly recovered the tops of the Hills, with great shouts and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
shows himself. Then the flight of the Romans, and the
slaughter of them was great, three thousand were slain, and eight
hundred taken Prisoners, the rest hardly escaping. The news of this
slaughter being brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> they were in a dreadful fear left <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
should now march directly to the City, wherefore they mann'd
their Walls, and furnished them with Darts, and the Old Men armed,
and for want of Arms, they took out of the Temples such, as being
taken in former Wars, had been there hung up for Trophies; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Custom in all extremities, they created <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi>
Dictator. But <hi>Hannibal,</hi> God averting him, turned off toward the Ioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Sea, and wasting all their Coasts, got a vast prey. <hi>Servilius</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul
opposing himself to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> came to <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>minium,</hi> and that he might
keep those Gauls, not yet alienated in their fidelity, staid with his Army
one days march from thence, till <hi>Fabius</hi> the Dictator coming, sent <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilius,</hi>
who after the creation of a Dictator, had no more power either
as Consul or General, to <hi>Rome;</hi> and himself followed <hi>Hannibal</hi> close at
the heels: but yet forbearing to engage him, though often provoked to
it, thinking it enough, if warily watching him, he prevented him from
besieging any Towns. <hi>Hannibal,</hi> the whole Country being wasted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be in want, wherefore ranging it over once more, and for many
days drawing up his Forces, he endeavoured to tempt <hi>Fabius</hi> to fight. But
the Dictator made no show of having any thoughts to engage him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
though <hi>Minutius Rufus,</hi> General of his Horse, disallowed this proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and wrote to his Friends at <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Fabius</hi> through fear and
cowardise declined Battel. But it happened that <hi>Fabius</hi> going to <hi>Rome</hi>
to perform the usual Sacrifices, <hi>Minutius</hi> fought a set Battel with <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi>
wherein he seemed to have the better; whereupon grown more
furious, he wrote to the Senate, accusing <hi>Fabius,</hi> that he had no mind to
overcome. The Senate at <hi>Fabius</hi> return to the Army, thereupon made
the Power equal between the Dictator and Master of the Horse: So they
divided the Forces between them, and pitch'd their Camps apart, each
stedfast in his own opinion. <hi>Fabius,</hi> that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was to be dealt with
by temporizing, still vexing him, and taking care that he did no mischief
<hi>Minutius,</hi> that he was presently to be fought with: But when he a while
after engaging <hi>Hannibal, Fabius,</hi> who lay still with his Forces, well fore-seeing
what after hapned, received <hi>Minutius</hi>'s Soldiers put to flight and
repulsed, <hi>Hannibal</hi> pursuing them, thereby securing <hi>Minutius</hi> from a
very great slaughter; and being nothing less kind to him, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all his false accusations; then, I say, <hi>Minutius</hi> of his own accord
condemning his own want of knowledge, resigning his Command, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
his part of the Army up to <hi>Fabius:</hi> Which passages <hi>Augustus</hi> in
after times often remembred, who was himself wary of fighting, and
chose rather to prevail by Policy than Power. <hi>Fabius</hi> no less diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than before watch'd <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s motions, hindring him from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:65196:129"/>
and though declining a general Engagement, still falling upon
all stragling parties, not doubting in a short time to reduce <hi>Hannibal</hi> to
want of Provisions. Till both Armies drawing nigh to certain straits,
which <hi>Hannibal</hi> foresaw not, <hi>Fabius</hi> sent before four thousand men, who
forthwith possessing themselves of the straits, he himself pitch'd his
Camp upon a certain Hill on the other side, where he lay secure. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
seeing himself thus besieged, being shut in one side by <hi>Fabius</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and on the other by those guarded the passes, was struck with such
a violent fear, as he never had been before; for he could perceive no
way of escape, all other places being craggy and inaccessible: So that
despairing
how to get loose from <hi>Fabius,</hi> being so close block'd up, in
this fear and trouble of mind, he caused five thousand Prisoners (left
taking the opportunity of this present danger, they might raise some Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
and disorder) to be killed in cold blood. Then he commanded
Torches to be tyed to the Horns of all the Cattle he had in the Camp,
whereof there were abundance; and the next night setting on flame
the Torches, and putting out all other Fires in the Camp, committed it
to the care of the stoutest young men in his Army, to drive them up
the craggy ways, between the straits and <hi>Fabius</hi>'s Camp, with all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
they could. The Oxen pricked forward by their Drivers, and
scorched with the Flame of the Torches, run up with great fury among
the Craggs and Precipices, and when any of them fell down, with
greater violence they strove to clamber up again. The Romans, who were
on both sides, when they saw a general silence and darkness in <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s
Camp, and perceived many lights shining in several places among the
Mountains, could not plainly, especially being in the night, discover what
the business should be. <hi>Fabius</hi> indeed suspected some device of <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals,</hi>
but being certain of nothing, kept within his Trenches. But those
set for the Guard of the straits, thinking (which was all he wished they
would do) that <hi>Hannibal</hi> sled, and was making his escape over the tops
of the Mountains, ran to the places whither the lights guided them, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
to oppress <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s men, labouring to get up. They were scarce
moved from their Post, when <hi>Hannibal</hi> with deep silence, and without
any light to keep the closer, runs in with his swiftest men, and possessing
himself of, and placing a good Guard in the straits, by sound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
gave notice thereof to the rest; at the sound of which the whole Camp
answered them with acclamations, and forthwith blew up their Fires.
Then the Romans knew the cheat; so the rest of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Army, and
those that drove the Cattel, got safe to the passage; and he with his whole
Army having thus beyond his own hopes got the Victory, and brought all
his men safe off; he marched forward till he came to <hi>Gerione,</hi> a City
of <hi>Apulia,</hi> stored with Corn, which making himself Master of, he spent
the Winter in the midst of plenty and abundance. <hi>Fabius</hi> with the same
resolutions and constancy still following him, pitch'd his Camp within
ten Furlongs of <hi>Gerione,</hi> the River <hi>Aufidus</hi> running between both Armies,
but the six Months being expired (which is the time established for the
Dictatorship at <hi>Rome)</hi> the Consuls <hi>Servilius Attilius,</hi> again entring into
their Magistracy, came to the Army, and <hi>Fabius</hi> returned to <hi>Rome.</hi> This
Winter many skirmishes and engagements of Parties happened betwixt
both Armies, in which always the Romans came off with the greater
Honour and Glory; wherefore <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who till that time writing to
his friends, used to adorn and set out his Letters with his own praises,
now began to distrust his Affairs, and require Supplies of Men and Money.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65196:129"/>
But his Enemies who from the very first condemned his undertakings, then
especially feigned not to understand him, for Conquerors, said they, did not
use to ask, but freely to send Mony to their own Country, which <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
proud with so many victories yet demands. At which words the
Carthaginians moved sent him neither men nor money, which <hi>Hannibal</hi>
deploring sent Letters into <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Asdrubal</hi> his brother commanding
him, that with the first of the Summer with all the force he had, and what
quantity of gold he could raise, he should make an irruption into <hi>Italy,</hi>
and wast the utter parts thereof, that both sides burning, the Romans
might be afflicted with a doubtful War: in this Posture stood <hi>Hannibals</hi>
affairs.</p>
               <p>The Fathers sorely grieved for the defeat of <hi>Flaminius</hi> and <hi>Centenius</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
and so many other cruel mischiefs, which they daily, as they thought
dishonorably suffered, not being able to endure the War to continue so
long at their own doors, and as it were in their very Seats, once more
raised and sent an Army into <hi>Apulia</hi> consisting of four Legions, enrolled
not without great regret in the City, and a mighty power of their Allies.
Withal they created two Consuls one famous for Warlike Prowess
<hi>L. Aemilius,</hi> who had made War in <hi>Illyria,</hi> the other of the Popular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<hi>Terentius Varro,</hi> a man who only with lofty promises soothed the
minds of the Common people, whom when they sent out armed to the
War, they besought as soon as they could to engage the Enemy, and not
by longer Protracting the War exhaust the City by so many recruits, of
Men, Mony, and Provisions, and through Idleness suffer the Country to
burn. The Consuls receiving the Army that was in <hi>Apulia,</hi> and being
now in all seventy thousand Foot and six thousand Horse, pitch their Camp
in <hi>Cannae</hi> a Town of <hi>Apulia</hi> directly opposite to the Carthaginians. <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
who had always been desirous to fight, and impatient of lying idle, at
this time more especially did not decline an Engagement, being pressed
to it by his own necessities, and a fear le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t the Mercenary Soldiers not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their wages paid, should either run away from him or be scattered
about the Country to get in Forrage. Wherefore he daily provoked the
Enemy, whilst the Consuls were of quite different, and disagreeing judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Aemilius</hi> thought that <hi>Hannibal</hi> was to be defeated by Tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
and patience, for that having only such Provisions as he day by day
fetcht in, he could not long subsist; whilst it was hazardous fighting an
Army and a General so long versed in Battels and accustomed to Victory:
but <hi>Terentius</hi> (raised by the people and therefore remembring the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Commands) was for present fight. None save only <hi>Servilius</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul
the year preceding were of <hi>Aemilius</hi> mind, but all the Senators and
those of the Order of Knights, who had any Office in the Army, were of
<hi>Terentius</hi> opinion. Whilst the Romans lay in this manner, <hi>Hannibal</hi> who
having a party sent out either to Wood or Forrage, set upon by them;
first overcome, about the last watch of the night discamped, and feigned
a flight as if he had fought to return to his own Country; which <hi>Varro</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
he drew out the Army as if he had been to pursue a flying Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<hi>Aemilius</hi> in the mean time earnestly forbidding it, and calling them
back, which when he saw did nothing avail, he went himself according to
the Roman Custome, to take the usual signs, and he seing the Chicken peckt
not, Commanded to let <hi>Varro</hi> know the ill Auspices. He indeed yielded
to Religion, but being returned into the Camp before all the Army tore
his Hair, crying out, that his Colleague had out of envy rob'd
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65196:130"/>
him of the victory, the whole croud assenting to what he said, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the like complaints. But when <hi>Hannibal</hi> saw his deceit had little
profited him, he forthwith returned into his Camp, and discovered his
dissembled flight, yet all this would not prevail with <hi>Varro,</hi> thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to suspect <hi>Hannibal,</hi> but on the Contrary going into the <hi>Praetorium</hi>
before all the Senators, Centurions, and Military Tribunes, he grievously
inveighed against <hi>Aemilius,</hi> who either by falsely representing the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
auspices, had rob'd the City of a Certain Victory, or through Fear
and Cowardise, not daring to fight himself, had envyed him the glory
of the day; in Raving manner uttering these speeches, the Soldiers who
stood about the Tent greedily receiving, and gladly hearing these words
with bitter reproaches blasted <hi>Aemilius,</hi> who yet forbore not though in
vain to advise many useful things, but when all save only <hi>Servilius</hi> were
furiously carried away by <hi>Varro</hi>'s perswasion, the next day which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
the last of his Command (for he after yielded it to <hi>Varro)</hi> he drew
out his Army to fight: <hi>Hannibal</hi> perceived it, but because he was not that
day sufficiently prepared, drew not out his Army. The next day both Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
drew into the field. The Romans in a triple Battel, so as that the main
body consisted of Armed Foot and the two Wings of light Armed Foot
and Horse. <hi>Aemilius</hi> commanded the main body, <hi>Servilius</hi> the left
Wing, and <hi>Varro</hi> the Right, and each had with them a body of about a
thousand chosen Horse to run up and down upon all occasions, and give
assistance where it was needful. This was the Order of the Roman battel.
<hi>Hannibal</hi> not ignorant, that a certain stormy wind (which they call
<hi>Vulturnus,</hi> and is the North East) blew usually about Noon in those parts,
made it his first care to take possession of the ground so, that he might
have the wind upon his back, Then upon a certain hill covered over with
trees, and broken in sunder by several close Valleys, he placed some Horse
and nimble Soldiers in Ambush, to whom he gave orders, that in the heat
of the battel, and when the wind was risen they should charge the Enemy
in the Rear, to these he added five hundred Celtiberians, who besides
their long Swords, wherewith they were girt, had under their Coat Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
or Jacks, short Daggers, to stand in a readiness till he had occasion
for them, and quietly to wait for the signal to be given them. Then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
likewise drawn his Army into a Triple Battel, and extended his Horse
as far as he could upon the Wings, to inclose the Enemy, he gave the
right Wing to <hi>Mago</hi> his brother, the left to <hi>Hanno</hi> his Nephew, and kept
the main Battel himself to be opposite to <hi>Aemilius,</hi> who had the greatest
Fame and knowledge in War, he had likewise two thousand Horse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
a thousand commanded by <hi>Maharbal</hi> whom he appointed to keep
continually moving, with orders upon occasion to assist any that were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.
And doing these things delay'd the battel till the second hour, at
what time the wind began to rise, when all things were put in good order,
the Generals began to incourage their respective Soldiers, the Romans by
putting them in mind of their Parents, Wives and Children, and withal
by remembring them of former defeats, let them know they fought this
battel for the last stake, and their own general and particular preservation.
<hi>Hannibal</hi> on the other side remembring his Men of their many famous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits,
and the several Victories they had already gained against this very
Enemy, told them dishonorable it would be, should they now be vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by those they had so often overcome. And now the Trumpets sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a charge and the Foot giving a shout, the light Armed Men first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
and then forthwith the Legions advanced to the Battel, then the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65196:130"/>
slaughter was great, and the labour mighty, both sides couragiously
maintaining the ground. In the mean time <hi>Hannibal</hi> gave Orders to his
Horse to inclose the Enemies Wings, whom the Roman Horse, though
far inferiour in number, yet being drawn out in length, and extended as
far as possible, with noble and undaunted courage received, especially
those in the left Wing toward the Sea. Wherefore <hi>Hannibal</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harbal</hi>
taking along those Horse they had with them, with a violent shock,
and a savage and barbarous howling, fell in upon the Romans, as if by
one fierce onset they would break through, and overset them; but the
Romans received their charge without amazement, or giving the least
ground. <hi>Hannibal</hi> seeing all these endeavours fruitless, lifted up the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
for those five hundred Celtiberians, who soon after going out of the
Body, as if they had deserted their party, delivered up to the Enemy
their Shields, Darts and Swords, which were all the Arms that appeared
about them. <hi>Servilius</hi> praising them, and soon disarming them, having, as
he thought no other Armour but their Coats of Male, commanded them
to set down behind the Army, not thinking it honourable in the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
sight to cast Revolters into Bonds; and seeing them disarmed all to
their Coats, he feared no hurt from them; besides the Army being in
all parts ingaged, it was a time very unseasonable to do any thing more
to them. About the same instant, some Regiments of the Africans dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
a flight, began with great cryes to run towards the Mountains,
that warned by the Signal (for so it was agreed on) those who lay in the
clefts of the Hill, might fall upon such as pursued them. So at one instant
all the Horse and light armed Foot rising out of their Ambushes, and at
the same time a great and violent storm of wind blowing the dust into the
Romans faces, and blinding them, besides the force of the wind driving
back the Roman Darts, and making them flee faintly and uncertain, whilst
the Carthaginians coming with it, flew more sure and strong; the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
not able any way to avoid these things, fell foul of one another, and
the whole Army began to stagger; when those Celtiberians laying hold
of this occasion to act their design, unsheathing their Daggers, first slew
those at whose backs they stood; and siesing on their Shields, Darts and
Swords, fell more freely upon the whole Body, and being behind them,
made a horrible slaughter. The Romans, (having their Enemies before
them, and being inclosed by Ambushes, and withal slain by these mixed
amongst them, upon whom they could not turn, being so pressed by the
Carthaginians in Front, and being likewise deceived by the likeness of
the Arms, for the Celtiberians having got Roman Shields, they were
scarce to be distinguished from their own men) were distracted with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and doubtful dangers; but among these misfortunes, the dust raised
by the wind, did most of all afflict the Romans, for they could neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
their own loss; but (as is usual in all frights and tumults) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
every thing worse than it was, and thought the Ambushes greater,
and those five hundred much more numerous; wherefore at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
their Camps already encompassed by the Horse and Fugitives,
they began to make a disorderly flight, first on the right Wing, <hi>Varro</hi>
himself leading the way, and afterwards on the left, whose Commander
<hi>Servilius</hi> running in to <hi>Aemilius,</hi> and about ten thousaud stout Horse and
Foot gathering about these two Commanders, they first, and by their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
the rest of the Horsemen soon after alighting, though they were
on all sides encompassed round, yet on foot renewed the fight against
<hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Horse. There might be beheld all that men skilful in War,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65196:131"/>
and reduced to utter despair, could in that rage and fury act against an
Enemy; yet they were slain on all sides, and now <hi>Hannibal</hi> himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closing
them, encouraged his men, sometimes with exhortations to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
the relicks of the Victory, and sometimes reproaching their cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardise,
that when the whole Army was scattered and fled, they could not
overcome so small a number: Yet the Romans, as long as <hi>Servilius</hi> and
<hi>Aemilius</hi> stood, kept their Orders, giving and receiving multitudes of
wounds: but when those two Generals fell, stoutly forcing their way
through the midst of their Enemies, and then dispersing themselves, they
fled, and many of them escaped to several Quarters. There were about
fifteen thousand, who at the beginning of the rout, had fled into the two
Camps, these <hi>Hannibal</hi> forthwith besieged: two thousand that had fled
into the Town of <hi>Cannae,</hi> yeilded themselves to him, a few got safe to
to <hi>Canusium,</hi> and the rest were dispersed through the Woods. This was
the event of the Battel at <hi>Cannae,</hi> begun the second hour of the day, and
continuing till two hours within night, till this very time famous for the
great slaughter, there being in few hours no less than fifty thousand kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
great numbers taken alive, many Senators slain, with all the Centurions
and Primipiles, and the two bravest of three Generals; for as to the third
he most cowardly (though the Author of this Calamity) ran away at the
beginning of the rout. Thus the Romans in two years War with <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
had lost of their own, and their Allies, no less than two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
                  <hi>Hannibal</hi> having gained this famous and signal Victory, in which by
four several Actions he demonstrated the Excellency of his Conduct,
when he gained the wind of the Enemy, when he made the Celtiberians
feign a revolt, when he dissembled a Flight, and when he placed his
Ambushes. The next thing he did was to take a view of the dead, among
whom when he beheld many of the bravest of his Friends; 'tis said
that sighting he cryed out, <hi>He stood not in need of more such Victories:</hi> Much
like to which is reported to have in the former Age been said by <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi>
King of <hi>Epire,</hi> That by such defeats he should hardly vanquish the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.
Those who were fled into the greater Camp, under the leading
of <hi>Publius Sempronius,</hi> broke through <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Watches, tired for
want of sleep, and fighting resolutely, and got about ten thousand of them
to <hi>Canusium,</hi> but the five thousand that staid in the lesser Camp, were
the next day taken by <hi>Hannibal.</hi> The Consul <hi>Terentius,</hi> gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the relicks of the Army, and comforting them (sad, and quite cast
down as they were) in the best manner he could, and leaving the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of them to <hi>Scipio,</hi> Tribune of the Soldiers, went his way towards
<hi>Rome;</hi> whither when this news was brought, great multitudes promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
flocked to the Gates, lamenting their Friends, and calling them by
name, and deploring their own misfortunes, as if the Enemy were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
come to seise upon themselves; Mothers with their Children ran
up and down to the Temples, imploring the Gods, that at length they
would by some means put a stop to all these Miseries. The Magistrates
likewise seeing the City thus oppressed by the Divine Anger, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to appease the Gods with Prayers and Sacrifices, beseeching them to
rest satisfied with the past slaughter. The Senate sent <hi>Q. Fabius</hi> (who
likewise wrote a History of these things) to the Oracle at <hi>Delphos</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
about the present state of things, and manumitted eight thousand
slaves, strong young men, freely given by their Masters; gave Orders
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65196:131"/>
throughout the City, for preparing Bows and Shields; and <hi>Claudius Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi>
who was about to fail into <hi>Sicily,</hi> changing their minds, they decreed
to go against <hi>Hannibal.</hi> He dividing his Fleet with <hi>Furius</hi> his Colleague,
and sending part of his Forces into <hi>Sicily,</hi> with the rest consisting of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens,
Associates and Slaves to the numbers of about ten thousand Foot,
and two thousand Horse went to <hi>Theanum,</hi> that he might discover what
<hi>Hannibal</hi> designed. But <hi>Hannibal</hi> permitted some of the Captives to go
as Deputies to <hi>Rome,</hi> to see if the Citizens would at his price redeem any
of them, and three among all the rest being chosen to this office, of whom
<hi>Cn. Sempronius</hi> was chief, taking no other pledge but their Oath to return,
he let them go. Then the Neighbours of the Captives, standing round
about the place, offered with their own private Money to redeem who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they had a kindness for, beseeching the Senate to give them leave so
to do, the people all weeping, and approving their motion; some of the
Senators were of the opinion, that after so many Battels, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
was not to suffer the loss of so many men; and the Slaves were
not to be preferred before Free-men: but others argued that such indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
would accustom men to flight, who were rather to be taught how
to overcome or die. Nor was it just that those, who fled, should experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
any of their Clemency or Mercy. After many Examples produced
for and against it, the Senate at length forbid the Neighbours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
the Captives, as judging whilst they were still beset with so many
dangers, their present Clemency would be converted into furute damage,
and that though this at present seemed a doleful severity, and inhumani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
yet it would turn to future advantage; and indeed at that very time
the strange boldness of this resolution appeared dreadful to <hi>Hannibal</hi>
himself. Wherefore <hi>Sempronius,</hi> and the other two Captives, returned to
the Enemy. <hi>Hannibal</hi> hereupon sold some of the Prisoners, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
others to be slain, of whose dead Bodies he made a Bridge,
whereon his Army marched over the River; such of the Senate and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
as he had in his Camp, he set Father against Child, and Brother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Brother, compelling them to fight against each other for a divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his Africans; in a word, he omitted no insulting cruelty that the
pride of man could invent.</p>
               <p>Thence he turned his Arms to the wasting the Territories of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/>
Associates, and brought the Engines against <hi>Petelia.</hi> The Petelians,
though few in number, yet stout of heart, bravely resisted him, and the
Women assisting (who in courage yielded little to the Men) often sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying,
and stoutly fighting burnt his Engines; but at length, being wasted
by often skirmishes, and Famine creeping upon them, as soon as <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
had advice of it, he begirt the City with a circumvallation, and left
<hi>Hanno</hi> to prosecute the Siege. The Townsmens miseries increasing upon
them, they thrust out all the croud useless for War, between the Wall and
Trench, looking on with stedfast countenances, whilst <hi>Hanno</hi> caused them
to be slain, as envying their better manners of dying; yet almost all the
rest fell not long after under the same fate; for being oppressed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
want, they made a sally upon the Enemy, where after having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
many noble exploits, not caring to return to the City there to
starve, or wanting strength through hunger, they were almost all slain,
and <hi>Hanno</hi> possessed himself of the Town: some of the strongest, who
were able to flee, escaped, whom the Romans, when this War was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for their singular fidelity and good will towards them, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:65196:132"/>
Valour, caused to be diligently sought out (being in all about
eight hundred) and restored them to their Country. But when the Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiberian
Horse, who were Auxiliaries in <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Army were observed
to fight stoutly. The Roman Generals commanding in <hi>Spain,</hi> desired of
their Subjects a like number of such Horsemen, whom they sent into <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
to oppose the other. These by reason of the neighbourhood of the
Camps, found opportunities of free converse, and every one invited his
fellow Citizen or Country man, to come over to them; whence it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
that part of them fled over to the Romans, and other part slip'd
away, so that <hi>Hannibal</hi> now thinking nothing safe, grew jealous of them,
whilst they on the other side grew no less jealous of the fall of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian
Affairs: yet in <hi>Arpis,</hi> a City of <hi>Apulia,</hi> built as some say by
<hi>Diomedes</hi> the Argive, one <hi>Dasias,</hi> reported to be descended from the same
<hi>Diomede,</hi> though but upon uncertain gounds, however no way worthy
of so noble a Stock; after that signal slaughter at <hi>Cannae,</hi> revolted from
the Romans to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and drew his Country into the same defection;
but when, after <hi>Hannibal</hi> began to grow less successful, coming privately
to <hi>Rome;</hi> and being brought into the Senate, he offered as an amends for
his fault, to bring the City again under the Roman Power, he hardly
escaped being slain by the Romans, but most certainly they presently cast
him out of their City, so that now fearing both them and <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he
wandred like a vagabond about the Country, whilst <hi>Hannibal</hi> burn'd his
Wife and Children alive. The <hi>Arpi</hi> betrayed by others, were taken by
<hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> who slaying all the Carthaginians he found, placed there
a Garrison. But <hi>Tarentum,</hi> which was at the same time kept by a Roman
Garrison, was by this means betrayed to one <hi>Cononeus.</hi> This man being
much addicted to Hunting, and usually presenting some of his Game to
<hi>Iunius,</hi> Governour of the Garrison, began to grow very familiar with
him; but because in a Country not free from War, he pretended it much
better for the taking more Game, to go out by night, he brought it to
a Custom, that what time of the night he pleased, the Gates were to be
opened to him; then meeting with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and receiving Soldiers from
him (some whereof he hid in a Wood, not far from the Town, others
he commanded to follow him at a certain small distance, and others car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with him clad outwardly like Huntsmen, but underneath with
Coats of Male and Swords) he came to the Gates, having sent some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
who carried a huge Bore upon a Pole. The Gates being opened
according to Custom, those that entred with him presently slew the Guards,
then those that followed presently rushed in, receiving with them their
Companions that were in the Wood, then they all broke open the Gates,
and let in <hi>Hannibal;</hi> he being entred, easily possessed himself of all the
City; and granting Conditions to the Tarentines, set himself to the
besieging of the Cittadel, held out by the Romans. Thus was <hi>Tarentum</hi>
betrayed by <hi>Cononeus:</hi> but five thousand Romans were still in the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel,
and with them a good number of the Tarentines, and to these the
Governour of <hi>Metapontum,</hi> brought half his Soldiers, and a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Darts, and all manner of Engines, with which they easily drove
<hi>Hannibal</hi> from the Wall: but he abounding in all those things, brought
up his Testudo's and Catapultas to the Towers, and shook some of them,
and with Hooks fastned to Ropes, pull'd down the Battlements, and
laid the Wall naked. The Romans throwing down Stones broke the
Engines, and with Nooses pulled away the Hooks, and with frequent
Sallies issuing out upon the Enemy, seldom returned without putting them
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65196:132"/>
to disorder, and doing good execution. And when upon a clear day a
sudden wind arose, the Romans laying hold upon the opportunity, whilst
some of them from the Wall threw Fire-brands, tied about with Flax
and Pitch upon the Carthaginian Engines, others made a sally and put
Fire under them; so that <hi>Hannibal</hi> despairing to take it by force, drew
Lines of Circumvallation quite round, save only towards the Sea, which
was not to be done, so leaving the care of the Siege to <hi>Hanno,</hi> returned
into <hi>Apulia.</hi> The Port of the Tarentines looks towards the North, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sail in by the <hi>Isthmus;</hi> but they cut off the <hi>Isthmus</hi> by Bridges, which
when the Romans held, they easily had Corn brought to them by Sea,
and hindred any from being brought to the Tarentines: so that the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines
were reduced to extreme want; wherefore <hi>Hannibal</hi> at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
advised that digging through the publick way, which leads from
the Port towards the other Sea to the Southward, they should make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<hi>Isthmus,</hi> which being performed, the want of Corn was soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied,
and they with their Brigantines much incommoded the Roman
Garrison, who had no Fleet, especially in a smooth Sea, intercepting all
Provisions brought to the Romans. The Romans therefore strugling with
the want of all necessities, the <hi>Thurini</hi> sent them by night some Ships
laden with Corn, accompained with some <hi>Triremes,</hi> whom the Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,
who now were all one with the Carthaginians, having notice of, laid
wait for, and took with all their Corn and Men, but they sending often
about redeeming the Captives, the Tarentines enticed their Deputies to
<hi>Hannibals</hi> party, so <hi>Hannibal</hi> released all the <hi>Thurini</hi> that were taken, who
returning home against the will of the rest, opened their Gates to <hi>Hanno,</hi>
so the <hi>Thurini</hi> endeavouring to preserve <hi>Tarentum</hi> for the Romans, most
imprudently fell themselves under the Carthaginian power. The Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that was in the City, retreated privately to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> The Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontines,
after part of their Garrison was drawn off to <hi>Tarentum,</hi> slaying
those few that remained, delivered themselves up to <hi>Hannibal;</hi> whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
out of fear rather than good will, <hi>Heraclea,</hi> which is situate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Metapontum</hi> and <hi>Tarentum</hi> followed; and now <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Affairs
appeared again very glorious. The year following, some Lucanians, who
had fallen off from the Romans, <hi>Gracchus</hi> chastised by War. But one <hi>Flac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
a Lucanian of that party, which yet stood for the Romans, a friend
and host to <hi>Gracchus,</hi> proved a Traytor to him. This man perswaded him
to come to a certain place, where the Lucanian Pretors (who repenting
their fault, desired to be again received into the Roman friendship) would
mutually give and receive their Faith, he not imagining any deceit in the
matter, followed only with thirty Horse: But when the Numidian Enemy
rose and encompassed him about, and <hi>Flaccus</hi> joyned himself with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>Gracchus</hi> discovering the Treason, with many others leap'd from their
Horses, and bravely fighting in the midst of his Enemies, was with all
his men slain. Three only <hi>Hannibal</hi> could take alive, though he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
all he could to make the Roman Proconsul his Prisoner; whom
though thus basely overcome by treachery, yet admiring him for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
valour showed at his death, he honoured with Funeral Rites, and
sent his bones to <hi>Rome.</hi> Thence marching into <hi>Apulia,</hi> made it his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to fetch in Corn from all parts.</p>
               <p>But when the Romans had determined to march towards <hi>Capua, Hanno</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:65196:133"/>
being sent before by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> with a thousand Foot, and as many Horse,
he unknown to the Enemy, got into the City; day breaking, when the
Romans beheld many of them upon the Walls, and knew the matter, they
forthwith drew off their Army from thence, and set themselves to reaping
all the Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ans, and the rest of the Corn of <hi>Campania,</hi> which the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panians
being much troubled at, <hi>Hannibal</hi> sent them word he had Corn
enough in <hi>Apulia,</hi> whither they might send for it, as often as they pleased<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they sent not only their Men and Cattle, but even their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to fetch in Corn, fearing no danger in the journey; <hi>Hannibal</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon return out of <hi>Apulia</hi> into <hi>Campania,</hi> and lying encamped near
the River <hi>Alor,</hi> not far from the Beneventines, whom only because they
continued faithful to the Romans, they were afraid of; but now because
of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s presence they despised. But it happened that about the
same time <hi>Hannibal</hi> being called by <hi>Hanno</hi> among the Lucanians went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
leaving the most troublesome part of his Baggage in the Camp, near
<hi>Beneventum,</hi> with an indifferent Guard, of which the Roman Generals
(for they were two, <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Annius)</hi> having certain advice, fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Campanians, that were gone to fetch Corn, and finding them a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
and undisciplined multitude, slew many, and gave their Corn to
the Beneventines, then plundering <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Camp took thence all that
he had there left. Then the two Roman Generals joyning together,
whilst <hi>Hannibal</hi> staid in <hi>Lucania,</hi> begirt <hi>Capua,</hi> with a Trench and a Wall;
and drawing other Lines without, pitch'd their Camp between both, raising
Bulwarks both towards the City, and towards the Country, to oppose the
assaults of the Enemy: so that the face of their Camp was like a great
Town, inclosing a little City, and the space between their Lines and the
Town, being about two Furlongs like a Theater, where daily Combats
were to be seen (the stoutest men on both sides continually challenging
and provoking one another) among which, that of <hi>Claudius Atellus</hi> was
very memorable, he was challenged by one <hi>Taureas,</hi> a Campanian, whom
having overcome, the vanquished fled towards the City: <hi>Claudius</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
him to the very Walls, not being able to turn his Horse, the Gate
standing to receive his Enemy, he was carried in, and running through
the whole Town, got out at the other Gate, and came safe to his own
party, a strange success of undesigned boldness. <hi>Hannibal</hi> without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the business, which he was sent for into <hi>Lucania</hi> returned to <hi>Capua,</hi> to
undertake the defence of that City, which he knew for so many, and so
great things commodious for the Romans, wherefore he assaulted their
Works: but when he could by no manner of means prevail to send in any
supply of Men, or Provisions into the Town, (for the Siege was so close,
that he could neither send in, nor get any intelligence out of the City) he
with all his Army marched directly towards <hi>Rome,</hi> moved thereunto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he heard that Famine was in the City, and out of hopes, either to
draw the Romans from the Siege of <hi>Capua,</hi> or act something greater
than the relief of that place. Wherefore continuing his March with a
great confluence of Warlike People (wherefore some perswaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that for want of strength, they would not so much as stop his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage;
others thought they should not so much as fight for it) he came and
encamped by the River <hi>Anien</hi> within thirty Furlongs of the City. Never
was <hi>Rome</hi> struck with such Fear and Tumult: They wanted all manner of
Forces (those they had being in <hi>Campania)</hi> and unexpectedly a mighty
Army was coming towards them, led by a General, whose Valor and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:65196:133"/>
made him unconquerable; yet with such Forces as they had, who
were able to bear Arms, they set Guards at the Gates: The Old Men
leaped up on the Walls, and the Women and Children brought Darts
and Stones, great multitudes flocked to them out of the Country, the
whole City rung with Howlings, Lamentations, Prayers, and mutual
Exhortations, some going out of the City broke down the Bride that was
over the <hi>Anien.</hi> The Romans had built a very little Town among the <hi>Aequi</hi>
and called it <hi>Alba,</hi> after the name of their Metropolis or mother City; but
in Process of time whether by lengthning or corrupting the word, or to
distinguish them from the <hi>Albans,</hi> they were called <hi>Albenies,</hi> two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of these coming to participate in the danger of <hi>Rome</hi> were presently
armed, and placed at the guard of the Gates. So much faith and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
at that time one only Colony among so many showed towards the
Romans, imitating the Example of the Plateans, who with a small Number
joyned with the Athenians at the fight at <hi>Marathon,</hi> that by united force
they might repulse the present danger. The Roman General <hi>Annius</hi>
stay'd at <hi>Capua</hi> not doubting to reduce that City, the other <hi>Claudius
Flaccus</hi> by another way, with incredible expedition came and pitcht his
Camp opposite to <hi>Hannibal</hi> on the other side of the <hi>Anien.</hi> Who when
<hi>Hannibal</hi> saw the bridge broken down, and found <hi>Claudius</hi> encamped on
the other side, he resolved to march round by the springs of the River,
and <hi>Claudius</hi> likewise thereupon removed his Camp. Here <hi>Hannibal</hi>
made use of his wonted stratagems he left some Horse, who when the
Armies were retired, Fording the River wasted the Roman Territory, and
when they had terrified the City, according to orders returned to <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal.</hi>
When he had got round the springs, 'tis reported that he came by
night with three spies to the City not far distant, and privately taking a view
of the site of it, observed the great fear and solitude within the walls, yet
after all this he returned to <hi>Capua,</hi> whether some God or any other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
at that time averted him, whether he dreaded the Valor and Fortune
of the City, or whether (as he used often to say to his Friends exhorting
him to the Conquest of it) that he would not ruine it, least when that was
done the Carthaginians should take from him the Command, and reduce
him to the quality of a private Man; for as for the Claudian Army it was
no way to be compared with <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s. Yet <hi>Claudius</hi> at <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
followed him at the heels, thinking he did enough if he hindred him
from Forraging, and took care that by Ambushes he did not damnifie
him.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Hannibal</hi> in a dark and moonless night having discovered the place <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/>
whither <hi>Claudius</hi> Army tended, built indeed no wall, but throwing up a
trench, and leaving some intervals for Gates, and lastly raising a Rampire
(which might serve instead of a Wall) opposite to it, there continued
himself, and sending his Horse to a certain eminence fortified by Nature
charged them there to stand quiet, and not move from the place till the
Romans should possess themselves of that place he hoped they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to be void. Then he gave Command to his Indians that getting upon
their Elephants, they should by any means between the intervals or over
the Rampire get into <hi>Claudius</hi> Camp. At a little distance from these he
commanded some Trumpets and Cornets to follow, with Orders as they
entred to make the greatest noise they could possible, that their Numbers
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65196:134"/>
might seem the greater; sending along with them some that could speak
the Latine Tongue, who were to call out aloud to the Soldiers by <hi>Claudius</hi>
Orders to desert their Tents, and escape to the next hill. This stratagem
of <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s succeeded at first to his mind, and according as he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
it, for Elephants trod down the Rampire, and the Trumpets fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them, whose noise filling the ears of the Roman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Soldiers starting
out of their beds in a dark night, and so unexpectedly, struck a mighty
terror into them. Besides hearing in the Latine Tongue, Command gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
about possessing the other Hill; they already addressed themselves to
flight. But <hi>Claudius</hi> to whom all <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s devices (as full of deceit and
treachery) were suspected, immediately out of his own prudence, or by
instinct from some God, or else being by some Captive informed of the
whole project, dispatched away the Military Tribunes into the way leading
to the hill, to stop such as rushed out, and tell them, that those Orders
were Proclaimed not by their Generals Command, but by <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s, and
therewithal himself drawing first strong guards to the Rampire, to repulse
the Enemy if perhaps any assault should be made, ran through the tents,
crying out, that there was no danger, that only a few were broke in with
the Elephants, whose small Number indeed when it appeared (for by this
time by <hi>Claudius</hi> command Torches were lighted, and fires blown up)
the Romans fear was turned into anger, and falling upon them being but
light armed men they easily slew them. As for the Elephants there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
room to receive them, they ran confusedly among the Tents and
Huts, and no Darts (because of the narrowness of the place and the vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their bodies being thrown in vain) they were every where wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
till with anguish they grew so enraged, that tumbling down and tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under foot their riders (for they could not govern nor turn them upon
the Enemy) with rage and horrid yellings they broke out of the Camp.
Thus <hi>Claudius Flaccus</hi> by stedfast courage and diligence circumvented
<hi>Hannibal</hi> in an unexpected stratagem, and by defeating him of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
both overcame him, and by his prudence preserved his trembling
Army. <hi>Hannibal</hi> failing in this enterprise drew his forces into <hi>Lucania</hi> to
their Winter quarters, where this fierce man never before accustomed to
delights gave himself over to Lust and Luxury. By which means by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
and not long after he brought a strange change upon all his affairs.
<hi>Claudius</hi> returned to his Colleague to <hi>Capua,</hi> and now both of them strove
their utmost to reduce this Town, hoping to force it whilst <hi>Hannibal</hi> lay
quiet in his Winter-quarters. The Campanians in want of all things (for
nothing could be brought them from abroad) and ready to perish for
hunger yielded themselves up to the Roman Generals. And with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>Hanno</hi> and <hi>Bostar,</hi> who commanded the Carthaginian Garrison
with all their Soldiers, and the Romans placing a Garrison in the City, cut
off the hands of all the Fugitives they there found, the <hi>African</hi> Nobility
they sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> the rest they sold. Then turning upon the Campanians,
the Authors of the Defection they punished with death, the rest only with
fines upon their Lands. The Country of <hi>Campania,</hi> because a Champian,
is very Fertile. <hi>Capua</hi> thus restored to the Romans, the Carthaginians
were deprived of a very considerable place for the conveniency of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in <hi>Italy.</hi>

Among the Brutians (who are a part of <hi>Italy</hi>) a Man of the City of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/>
                  <hi>Sisia,</hi> a Man addicted to Hunting, and accustomed to bring part of his
game to the Governor of the <hi>Punick</hi> garrison had so wrought himself into
his friendship, that he was in a manner his Consort in Command, who
grieved in mind to see the Soldiers insolencies and abuses of his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
made a contract with the Roman General, to which they both
pledged their Faiths, and by degrees brought into the Cittadel as Prisoners
many Roman Soldiers, whose Arms himself siesed on as his spoils, when
he thought his Number sufficient, he loosed their Bonds, and arming
them, overpowring the Punick Garrison, brought in a Roman; but not
long after <hi>Hannibal</hi> passing that way, the Garrison affrighted fled to <hi>Rhegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi>
the <hi>Tisiatae</hi> delivered themselves to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who burning the chiefs of
the Revolts, placed there another garrison. At <hi>Salatia</hi> in <hi>Apulia,</hi> which
was then under the Punick power, there were two kinsmen, who both for
their Riches and Power, might well be esteemed Princes, but between whom
there was perpetual discord. <hi>Dasius</hi> favored the Carthaginian, and <hi>Blasi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</hi>
the Roman affairs. As long as <hi>Hannibal</hi> was prosperous <hi>Blasius</hi> lay still,
when the Roman Power by recovery of most part of it's Empire began
to revive, <hi>Blasius</hi> had the confidence to move his Enemy, at least to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with him for the safety of his Countrey, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t if the Romans should
take the place by storm, he should become engaged in an irrecoverable
misfortune. <hi>Dasius</hi> dissembling a consent betray'd the matter to <hi>Hannibal,
Hannibal</hi> was Arbitrator and Judge, <hi>Dasius</hi> the accuser. <hi>Blasius</hi> being
guilty had only this one thing to say in his defence, that out of private
enmity, he laid false crimes to his charge, and indeed the knowledge that
his accuser had long been his enemy, and bore him a secret grudge, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him the more freedome to argue in his own defence. <hi>Hannibal</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
contemning the thing, nor giving too much Credit to an Enemy,
Commanded them both to withdraw, as if he would consider of it by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
But the place as they went out being very narrow, and none being
nigh enough to bear witness, <hi>Blasius</hi> thus whipped <hi>Dasius. And will not
you good man yet save your Country, Dasius</hi> crying out immediately, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats
it to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> upon which <hi>Blasius</hi> making his complaint, <hi>Now, now</hi>
(said he) <hi>there is no man but will believe snares laid for my life by the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of my Enemy, but this trick of his if I before lay under any suspicion will
perfectly clear me of it, for who pray that is not mad would trust such a thing to
an Enemy? But you may object, it may be at first I was deceived in him, but I
beseech you what man that is brought to his Tryal, and denying the Fact before
the Tribunal in the hearing of many, his accuser present who may reveal it will
afresh communicate such a thing to him, who has already shewed his mind to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
him? But if he were a faithful friend indeed what help could he bring to
me towards the safety of his Country? or why should I implore his help who
has no power to give any? These words Blasius</hi> pronounced aloud, and as I
believe foreseeing the event, and then making way to whisper <hi>Dasius</hi> in
the ear, told him that he would lessen his future Credit and Authority,
and so work <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that he should not believe any crime he objected
against him. Nor did <hi>Blasius</hi> after he was dismissed forbear to ply his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
in this manner, as a man whom now he contemned, having taken
off all belief of what he said. Therefore <hi>Dasius</hi> at length feigned himself
moved by his solicitations with intent to get from him all the manner how
he had formed his design which he nothing demurring upon; <hi>I will said
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65196:135"/>
he, go to the Roman Camp</hi> (which the other knew to be then very remote)
<hi>and thence receiving some forces from the Praetor, who is my very good friend,
bring them hither. Thou shalt work for me here and stay to keep the City,</hi> and
having thus said presently without <hi>Dasius</hi> being privy to it he went from
the City directly to <hi>Rome,</hi> and not to the Camp, where leaving his Son
for Hostage, and receiving from the Senate a thousand Horse, makes a
speedy return, already in his mind presaging the event. <hi>Dasius</hi> for some
days after not seeing his adversary, strait way conjectured that having
now his word, he was gone to perfect the business, and whilst he medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
upon the great distance he was to find the Camp at, slowly and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
he goes to <hi>Hannibal</hi> not doubting but to return time enough to be
there before the other. And being come to the speech of <hi>Hannibal, Now,</hi>
said he, <hi>whilst he is bringing an Armed Power into the City, I will in the
very Action deliver</hi> Blasius <hi>into thy hands,</hi> and so telling the whole matter
and receiving some Soldiers from <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he flies towards his Country
which he imagined <hi>Blasius</hi> could not yet be come nigh to. But he having
already slain the Punick Garrison which was but small, took diligent care
that none should go out of the City, and shutting all the rest of the Gates,
left that only open by which <hi>Dasius</hi> was to return, he likewise to avoid all
suspicion left the Walls every where naked; but the way within was so
broken, and block't up with Ditches, that there was no way of breaking
out. <hi>Dasius</hi> coming and finding the Gates open, rejoycing, and thinking
he was got thither before his Enemy, entred the City triumphing, but
he and all that came in with him being inclosed, and because of the Ditches,
having no way of retreat <hi>Blasius</hi> easily slew them, except only a few that
leaping over the Walls escaped. So <hi>Blasius</hi> catching <hi>Dasius</hi> in the snare at
last overcame him.</p>
               <p>Now whilst <hi>Fulvius</hi> the Roman Consul besieged <hi>Herdonia, Hannibal</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to him pitcht his Camp close by him, putting out (the better to lie
hid) all fires, and Commanding a strict silence through all the Camp.
And the morning hapning likewise to be very cloudy, he sent before some
Horse to provoke the Romans, they indeed with some trembling at first
(as being raised out of their beds) but soon with better confidence (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they believed them only a few pickt up here and there) repulsed the
Enemy, but <hi>Hannibal</hi> fetching a Compass about the other part of the
Town, that he might take a view of it, and put the Townsmen in hopes,
at length whether because they had spied him, or else by chance falls in
upon the Romans and incloses them. Then set upon on both sides they
rush'd on in disorder, so that the Consul <hi>Fulvius</hi> with eight thousand men
were slain, the rest making a speedy retreat within a Trench before their
Camp, and bravely fighting preserved both that and their Tents from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken by <hi>Hannibal.</hi> After this whilst the Romans wasted the lands of
the Apulians, because they had revolted, <hi>Hannibal</hi> did the like to the
Campanians who were all but the <hi>Attellani</hi> returned to the Romans obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
whom (because they should not be vexed with the Wars of the
<hi>Brutii,</hi> Lucanians and Apulians) he brought to <hi>Thurium,</hi> and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
sent the Exiles of <hi>Nuceria</hi> to inhabit <hi>Attella,</hi> and with their Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing
<hi>Hannibals</hi> associates, came to <hi>Antonia</hi> which they took, and laid wast
all the Brutians Fields, and at the same time besieged <hi>Tarentum</hi> by Sea and
Land, which then was kept by a Punick Garrison under <hi>Carpalo</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65196:135"/>
who because the Carthaginians were few, had taken the Brutians
into association with him; the Commander of whose Forces loved a
Wench, whose brother was a Soldier among the Romans, who by his
sisters means wrought the Brutian officer to betray that part of the Wall
he had the Charge of, so the Romans recovered <hi>Tarentum</hi> a Town very
convenient for them both to Sea and Landward. <hi>Hannibal</hi> made all the
hast he could to <hi>Tarentum,</hi> but on his march having certain intelligence of
it's being taken, being much troubled he retreated to <hi>Thurium,</hi> from
whence he went to <hi>Venusium,</hi> where <hi>Claudius Marcellus</hi> who had subdued
<hi>Sicily,</hi> now the fifth time Consul, and <hi>T. Crispinus</hi> had their Camp: yet
they forbore fighting. But <hi>Marcellus</hi> by chance espying a party of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians,
going out upon the spoil, and thinking them but few, with
three hundred Horse securely charged them, being a man of a daring
courage, and in all dangers too rashly forward, but when the Africans
coming in from all parts fell upon him, the Rear of the Romans first began
to fly, but <hi>Marcellus</hi> who still thought they followed him, fought valiantly
till struck through with a Dart he fell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his body being brought to <hi>Hannibal</hi>
when he saw it wounded on all sides, he commended him as a Soldier, but
much condemned him as a General, but taking off his Ring, he Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
burnt it, and sent the bones to his Son into the Camp. And then
before the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame of his death should spread too far, being deadly mad with
the Salatians he dispatched away a Roman fugitive to <hi>Salatia</hi> with letters
sealed with <hi>Marcellus</hi> Ring, signifying that <hi>Marcellus</hi> with his Army was
coming thither, and commanding them to open their Gates. The Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
having a little before received letters from <hi>Crispinus</hi> (for he sent to
all the Cities Messengers to acquaint them that <hi>Hannibal</hi> had got <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
Ring) lest if they stayd the messenger any time they should betray
their own Counsels, sent him away with promise to obey the Commands.
Mean while arming and disposing themselves upon the Walls, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
the issue of the deceit, <hi>Hannibal</hi> coming with his Numidians wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Roman Arms, the Port-cullis being drawn up, and the Gate opened,
they with great joy and Alacrity received them, as if it had been <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus,</hi>
but when as many were come in as they thought they were hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely
able to deal with, they let fall the Port-cullis, and slew all those
were got within the City. <hi>Hannibal</hi> thus frustrated of his hopes at <hi>Salatia</hi>
retreated.</p>
               <p>Whilst these things were doing, <hi>Asdr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>bal</hi> brother to <hi>Hannibal</hi> had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/>
brought into <hi>Italy</hi> that mercenary Army leavyed by him in <hi>Spain,</hi> being
in his march kindly received by the Gauls, and in two months passing the
<hi>Alpes</hi> (before laid open by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and which he very hardly effected
in six) he falls down into <hi>Hetruria</hi> with thirty eight thousand Foot, eight
thousand Horse, and fifteen Elephants; thence he wrote letters to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his coming, which being intercepted by the Romans, who thereby
understood his strength, <hi>Salinator</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> gathering together all the Force
they could make, met with him at <hi>Siena,</hi> he who did not yet design fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but to joyn as soon as he could with his brother by night, removes his
Camp, and wandring through marshy places, and along the Banks of
Rivers that were not fordable, made no great progress. At the break of
day the Romans having discovered them, and following hard upon them
tyred with labor and watching, many Centuries being drawn up together
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:65196:136"/>
in a body, and coming up with them, fell all at once upon <hi>Asdrubal</hi>'s
Army, and taking many alive, routed his whole Army (which had it been
joyned with <hi>Hannibal</hi> would have made him appear invincible) thereby
freeing <hi>Italy</hi> from an unexpressible fear and terror. And 'tis my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that Providence thought fit to give the Romans this victory by way of
reprizal for the loss sustained at <hi>Cannae,</hi> for this was equal and parallel to
that both in the death of the Commander, and the utter ruine of the whole
Army. It hapned likewise that in both many Captives were taken, and
the next Morning the Conquerors in both became Masters of the spoil of
the vanquished Camp. Of such various fortune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sometimes adverse and
sometimes prosperous, did the Romans now make experience. The Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiberians
who escaped from the slaughter, returned some of them to their
own Country, and some got to <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who not a little tormented for
this loss of his brother, and so great an Army, through too much hast
and ignorance of the ways, slighting all the rest that in full fourteen
years he had with vast labours been getting in <hi>Italy,</hi> retreated among
the Brutians, who were the only people that continued in association
with him, and there quietly expected new recruits from <hi>Carthage.</hi>
And the Carthaginians did send him an hundred Ships laden with Corn,
and supplies of Men and Mony, which being conveyed by three hundred
<hi>Triremes,</hi> the Praetor of <hi>Sardinia</hi> set upon with his Gallies, and sinking
sixty, the rest got back to <hi>Carthage;</hi> From hence the penury of all things
in <hi>Hannibals</hi> Camp much increased, but especially the despair of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any help from <hi>Carthage;</hi> And to all these misfortunes this was
annexed that <hi>Mago,</hi> who was sent into <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Liguria</hi> to hire Soldiers,
sent no aid, but lay idle expecting the Event of things. Wherefore <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>
plainly foreseeing that he could not long continue in those parts, began
to contemn the Brutians themselves, as men that would ere long be stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to him, and to oppress them with heavier taxes, several towns fortified
by nature as if they practised a revolt he forced to remove into the plain,
and many persons whose Estates he had a desire to siese upon he condemned
upon false accusations.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> In the mean time there entred into the Consulate <hi>Licinius Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
and <hi>P. Scipio,</hi> famous for his Conquests in <hi>Spain. Crassus</hi> went
into <hi>Apulia</hi> against <hi>Hannibal. Scipio</hi> advised the people that <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi>
and the Carthaginians, could not possibly be driven out of
<hi>Italy,</hi> till an Army were transported into <hi>Africa,</hi> and they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
with Domestick danger. And assiduously insisting upon it,
and daily urging them all to it, he at length got <hi>Africa</hi> decreed
for his province. Then without any delay trasporting his Army into

                  </gap>rcising
his Soldiers, he was first carried to <hi>Locrisa</hi> a City of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
(where <hi>Hannibal</hi> had placed a <hi>Punick</hi> Garrison) whom having
overpowred, leaving <hi>Pleminius</hi> as his Lieutenant in that City, he
passed over into <hi>Africa,</hi> but <hi>Pleminius</hi> forbore not to treat the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crians
with all manner of villanous and contumelious usage and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
insomuch that he rob'd the very Temple of <hi>Proserpine.</hi>
Wherefore the Romans for these horrible dealings with their
Friends and Kindred put him to death in Prison, and confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his goods delivered them to the Locrians to be laid up in
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65196:136"/>
the Treasures of the Goddess, and of the Mony taken away by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge
they recovered as much as they could, and what remained
it pleased them to supply out of the publick Exchequer. At the
same time <hi>Crassus</hi> drew away from <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s party, <hi>Consentia</hi> a
great City of the Brutians and many other Towns; but when at
<hi>Rome.</hi> the dismal prodigies had filled the minds of men with super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition,
the Decemvirs commanded to bring the Sibyls Books re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
that few days before in <hi>Pessinuntium</hi> a City of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> where
the Mother of the Gods is Worshipped, something was fallen from
heaven which should be brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> and not long after the
news of its falling came, and the image of the Goddess was
brought to <hi>Rome,</hi> and on the same day that it happened to come
thither was celebrated the Feast of the Mother of the Gods. There
is a report that the Ship which brought it struck upon a Shoal in
the River <hi>Tiber,</hi> and that when by no means possible it could be
removed, the Southsayers foretold that it would follow, if drawn by
a woman that was pure and chast from any strange bed. <hi>Claudia
Quintia</hi> suspected but not guilty of Adultery (but her too loose and
free way of living had got her that ill report) first earnestly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon the Goddess to witness her innocency of that crime, and
then tying her Girdle to the Ship was followed by the Goddess.
So <hi>Claudia</hi> from an evil fame which she before lay under, got a
most glorious name. But before this exploit of <hi>Claudia</hi>'s, the Romans
admonished by the Sibyls books, that by the best man of all the
City they should send for the image out of <hi>Phrygia,</hi> presently sent
thither a man judged to be the best of those times, <hi>Scipio</hi> Surna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Nasica</hi> Son of <hi>Cn. Scipio,</hi> who died General in <hi>Spain,</hi> and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sin
Germain to that <hi>Scipio,</hi> who abating the Carthaginian pride
first bore the Surname of <hi>African.</hi> Thus was the Goddess brought
to <hi>Rome</hi> by the best of Men and Women. But when the Brutians
had intelligence that the Carthaginians in <hi>Africa</hi> had in several
Battels been defeated by <hi>Scipio,</hi> they seemed to be at strife who
first should desert <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and some of them slew the <hi>Punick</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons,
and others thrust them out of their Cities. Those who could
do neither, privately sent Deputies to <hi>Rome,</hi> to declare their good
Will, though they wanted Power. <hi>Hannibal</hi> came with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to <hi>Petelia,</hi> which City was given by him to the Brutians af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having expelled the former inhabitants. When therefore he
expostulated with them that they had sent Deputies to <hi>Rome,</hi> and
they earnestly denied it, he seemed to believe them, but that he
might prevent any occasion of suspicion, he gave up their Great
Men separately into the keeping of his Numidians, and disarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Citizens gave their Arms to the Slaves, and to them
committed the Charge of the City. Nor did he deal less se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
with other Cities to which he went in progress, for the <hi>Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi>'s
goods he exhibited to his Soldiers Rapine, and besides three
thousand Citizens whom he knew great lovers of the Carthaginians,
and five hundred Country people he carried away, and leaving the City
under the guard of the Prefidionary Soldiers, brought them all to <hi>Crotona,</hi>
which because of it's convenient Situation, he chose both for his Granary
and Seat of War.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:65196:137"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> But when by his Citizens (who to hasten him sent for him <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal</hi>
their Admiral) he was sent for to come home, and bringre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to his Country then in danger by <hi>Scipio</hi>'s many victories, he grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
complained of the Carthaginians, who had always been ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and perfidious to their Generals, as he had sufficiently and for a
long time experienced, and because he had given the first beginning
to this War in <hi>Spain,</hi> he began to be apprehensive of himself; Yet
he resolved since 'twas fit he obeyed to go, and forthwith caused a
great Number of Ships to be built, <hi>Italy</hi> furnishing him abundantly
with all Materials; But before his departure he exposed all the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociate,
and subjected Cities, whom now he looked upon as Enemies
to the Spoil and Plunder of his Army, that thereby enriching
them, he might by their kindness be secure from his Citizens Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies.
Yet ashamed himself, against Faith and Equity, to wrong in
this manner the Associates, he sent <hi>Asdrubal</hi> the Admiral under a
feigned pretence of visiting the Garrisons to do it, who going into
every City and Commanding the Citizens and their Slaves to pack
up what they could carry, and march elsewhere, he gave all that
remained up to be plundered; Which usage being divulged, many
before <hi>Asdrubal</hi> came to them, rose in Arms against the Garrison
Soldiers, and with various fortune, sometimes the Townsmen, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Soldiers had the better, hence followed mighty slaughters, with
the Rapes of Matrons, and Virgins, and other villanies usually committed
at the Sack of Towns. As for those Italian Soldiers who had deserved well
under him. <hi>Hannibal</hi> knowing them to be stout and well excercised Men,
with magnificent promises tried to draw them over with him into <hi>Africa.</hi>
Such as for any villanies committed were afraid to return into their own
Country condemning themselves to voluntary banishment; followed him,
but those who had no guilt upon their consciences refused to go. Those
therefore who chose rather to stay, then go, having commanded to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
all in one place (as if he either designed to speak to them or to
reward them for past services or command them somewhat for the future)
he encompassed with his Army, and commanded his men to chuse out
among them as many as they listed for Slaves. Some there were that those,
others were ashamed to take into such base servitude, those who as fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Soldiers had done so many brave things with them. Those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
that they might never be useful to the Romans he caused to be
thrust through with Darts; Likewise of four thousand Horses and Oxen,
no small Number, he caused the throats to be cut, because he had not the
Conveniency to carry them into <hi>Africa.</hi> After which embarking his
Army leaving only a few for a show of a Garrison in the Country of the
Brutians he stay'd only for a wind; but the <hi>Petelini</hi> and other Italians
rising upon them at their departure slew some and so retreated. Thus
<hi>Hannibal</hi> returning to <hi>Africa</hi> left <hi>Italy,</hi> which for sixteen whole years he
had wasted, and by a thousand miseries often reduced the desolate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
to the last Extremities, treating the Roman Subjects and Associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
with all contumelious Cruelty, and for those whose service, not so
much out of good will as necessity, he had formerly made use of, now
they could yield him no more help or advantage, he treated them likewise
as Enemies. <hi>Hannibal</hi> being gone, the Senate pardoned all those <hi>Italian</hi>
people had revolted to the Carthaginians, granting a perfect act of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65196:137"/>
for all things past. But the Brutians because they had continued his
ready Associates to the last, they condemned in part of their Land, and
took away all their Arms if they had any left after <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s plundring
them. All Service in the Militia (as people who had lost their right of
Freedom) was likewise forbidden them, and when the Roman Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
went into the Provinces to oversee any publick works, they Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to follow them like Servants. This was the Conclusion of
<hi>Hannibal</hi>'s Expedition into <hi>Italy</hi> in the two and fiftieth year of the
<hi>Punick</hi> Wars.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe Roman People often fell into Dissentions with the Senate,
upon the account of the Publication of Laws, the Abolition
of Debts, the Division of Lands, and the Election of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
but yet they came not to Blows; for these Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
were decided by the ways of Justice, because both
Orders bore to each other a mutual respect; so that though the people of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
saw themselves already armed against some Foreign Enemy, yet they
abused not that power to make any Sedition. And then when they drew
up to the<note n="*" place="margin">Aventine.</note> Mount, which therefore is called Sacred, they restrained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from committing any extraordinary violence, contenting themselves
only to create for the maintenance of their Rights a new Magistrate,
whom they called Tribune of the people. The creation of this Office was
designed only to counterpoise the Power of the Consuls, whose Election
then depended only on the Senates, and to keep them from exercising the
whole authority in the Administration of their Republique: yet this bred
abundance of Hate and Quarrels amonst these Magistrates, the one seeing
themselves supported by the Senate, and the other by the favour of the
people; and each party thought themselves robbed of that which was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the other. These same Contentions were the cause that <hi>Marcus
Coriolanus,</hi> being condemn'd without any desert of his, went into Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
among the <hi>Volsces,</hi> and soon after made War upon his Country; and
this was the first Civil Division wherein Arms were made use of, and which
only began by a Fugitive: yet after this they never bore Arms in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembliess
nor began any Massacre of their Fellow Citizens, till such time
as <hi>Tiberius Gracchus</hi> raised a Sedition, wherein he perished, and with him
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65196:139"/>
some others, who being fled to the Capitol, were slain near the Temple.
But after this Sacrilege, the Seditions were almost continual; the people
mutinying upon the least occasion, the Assassins ran up and down the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
sometimes on the one side, and sometimes on the other, Persons of
Quality were slain, either in some Temple, or in the Assembly, or in the
Palace, and that by order of the Tribunes, Praetors, Consuls, or other Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
Powers; insomuch that these Reciprocal Offences increased by little
and little the contempt of Justice and the Laws. This infection at last
spreading it self through all parts, open Conspiracies were made against
the Common-wealth, great Armies brought into the Field, sometimes those
had been banished and condemned, attempting some Novelties, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the principal men of the City fighting among themselves, as well
without as within for the Government of the State. There were likewise
some powerful and ambitious Citizens who aspired to the Government, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by keeping the Command of Armies entrusted to them by the people,
or levying fresh Soldiers by their own authority, to defend themselves, as
they said, against their Enemies: but under pretence of making War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Enemies, they made War against their Country, each party
striving who should first seise upon the City; so that whilst they treated
each other as Enemies, all places were filled with Assassinations, Proscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions,
Banishments, Executions and Tortures. In short, there was no
cruelty left uncommitted, especially then when about fifty years after the
death of <hi>Gracchus,</hi> one of the Factions driving away one mischief with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
became absolute Master of the Common-wealth, and for some time
governed it alone under the Title of Dictator, a certain Magistrate among
the Romans whom they never created but in extreme danger, for six
Months only, and whose use seemed to be abolished when <hi>Sylla</hi> obtained
that Dignity by force. Nevertheless, though all men believed that he was
created Dictator to perpetuity, yet having glutted himself, as one may say,
with power, he deposed himself; and certainly he was the first (at least that
ever I could gain knowledge of) that was so bold as to change a Tyranny
for a private life. He added to this action a discourse no less worthy of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.
He declared he was ready to give an account of his Administration
to whoever should demand it; and some time after came and walked in the
place in the habit of a private man, in the face of all the world, from
whence he returned to his House without having received the least affront
from any person; so much was that respect to the Sovereign Authority he
had possessed, engrafted in the minds of men, whether that they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished
at his laying of it down, or that they were ashamed to demand
an account of that man who offered himself to give it, or that they thought
it an inhumanity to hate that Power, how tyrannical soever it were, that
was joyned with the publick good. Thus the Seditions ceased for a time,
<hi>Sylla</hi> having applyed Remedies to the present Distempers, but they were
only fallen asleep; for they awakened again, and continued till such time
as <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> after having for some years made War in <hi>Gaul,</hi> would not
dismiss his Army, though the Senate decreed it; saying, it was not the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
desire, but <hi>Pompey</hi>'s, who being at present at the Head of the Army
in <hi>Italy,</hi> and his Enemy, had designed to reduce him under his power as
well as others. Yet he proposed these Conditions of Accommodation, that
either both should keep their Armies, or that <hi>Pompey,</hi> disarming as well as
he, should live like a private man under the authority of the Laws. But
not obtaining either the one or the other, he departed from <hi>Gaul,</hi> marched
against <hi>Pompey</hi> and his Country, entred the City, drove thence his Enemy,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65196:140"/>
overtook him in <hi>Thessaly,</hi> defeated him in a memorable Battel, and pursued
him as far as <hi>Egypt.</hi> Finding <hi>Pompey</hi> slain by the Egyptians, he returned to
<hi>Rome,</hi> after having settled the Egyptian Affairs, and settled their
<note n="*" place="margin">Ptolomy <hi>and</hi> Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Sister.</hi>
                  </note> Kings in that Kingdom; so that beholding himself secure by the death of
so powerful an Enemy, the mightiness of whose Actions had gained him
the Title of Great; and no person having thenceforth the boldness to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his will, he was created perpetual Dictator the next after <hi>Sylla.</hi> And
now again the Seditious were quieted, till such time as <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi>
either out of envy to his Power, or out of a desire they had to settle again the
Common-wealth in it's ancient form, slew in open Senate this man, so che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
by the people, and so knowing in the Art of Reigning. He was so
generally lamented, that they sought out for his Murderers, to put them
to death, that they solemnized his Funerals in the publick place, and there
where they had burnt his Body, erected a Temple, and offered Sacrifices to
him as a God. But now the Civil Discords began again, and in a short
time grew to that height, that they were followed by the Murders, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
and Banishments of many as well of the Order of Senators as
Knights, the Faction interchangeably delivering up the Enemies of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
so that to gain their own satisfaction, they spared neither Friends
nor their own Brothers, so much were men hurried on by their passion to
the prejudice of natural Piety. At last by a horrible boldness the Roman
Empire, as if it had been the Stock of some private Citizen, was divided
between <hi>Anthony, Lepidus,</hi> and he who at first was called <hi>Octavius,</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
took the name of <hi>Caesar,</hi> having been adopted by his Uncle. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this division they made War on each other, as it was but just they should,
and <hi>Caesar</hi> more prudent and politick than the other, first despoiled <hi>Lepidus</hi>
of <hi>Africa,</hi> which had fallen to this share. And in conclusion, after the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
of <hi>Actium,</hi> which he gained over <hi>Anthony,</hi> drove him out of all the
Provinces, extending from <hi>Syria</hi> to the Adriatick Gulf. The whole world
astonished at these prodigious Successes, he made himself likewise Master
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the most ancient and richest Kingdom possessed by any of the
Successors of <hi>Alexander,</hi> which only was wanting to complete the Roman
Empire to that height we now behold it. That done, he was placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the number of the Gods, whilst he was yet living, and beheld it;
and being called <hi>Augustus</hi> by the people, he assumed an authority over his
Country, and the subjected Nations, greater than ever was attributed to
his Father <hi>Caius,</hi> not so much as in the least appearance asking the votes of
the people: so that having secured his power by length of time, always
happy, and feared by all the world, he left his Successors capable of sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the weight of that great Empire, and the Sovereign Power being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united
in a single person, Concordance once more took place of Sedition.
This will be the subject of this work, which will contain the wonderful
Adventures of these People who aimed at Honour and Dominion through
all sorts of Calamities: and I shall write it the more willingly, because I
am obliged to treat of all these things before I write the Affairs of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
which are but a consequence of them; for those divisions wherein <hi>Cleopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra</hi>
took the part of <hi>Anthony,</hi> were the cause of the Reduction of <hi>Egypt</hi>
under the Roman Empire. And that I may settle some order in so great a
confusion of things, I will first speak of what passed from the <hi>Gracchi</hi> to
<hi>Sylla</hi>'s time, then what was done until the death of <hi>Caius Caesar,</hi> the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Books shall treat of the Wars of the <hi>Triumvirs</hi> with the Roman Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and against one another, until the last and greatest of these Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes;
I mean the Battle fought by <hi>Caesar</hi> at <hi>Actium</hi> against <hi>Anthony</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:65196:140"/>
and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> where I intend to begin the History of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Romans, as they now subdued one, and then another of the people <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
of <hi>Italy</hi> were accustomed to make seisure of a part of their Lands, to which
they sent Colonies, or otherwise gave Cities already built, to be inhabited
by their own Nation. These Colonies were placed in the conquered Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
in the nature of Garrisons, and they either set out by shares to these
new Inhabitants such Lands as were fit for Tillage, or otherwise sold them
to them, or let them out to Farm. As for the unprofitable ground (as War
often makes places desert) it not being qualified to bear a part in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidend,
it was proclaimed and given to the first that made offer to manure
it, on condition to pay an annual Tribute, the fifth part of the increase of
Trees, and the Tithe of the Corn, with an Impost upon all sorts of Cattel,
as well Flocks as Herds. Thus strove they to preserve the Italian Nation,
esteemed very laborious, that they might always have in a readiness Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
of their own people to serve them upon occasion; but the success
proved contrary to their expectations; for the rich undertaking at first the
unprofitable or desert Lands, and by prescription of time, not only assuring
to themselves the possession of them, but likewise joyning to them the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidend
of their poor Neighbours, either by force, or by money, became
possessed not of Villages, but of whole Countries, which their Slaves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
and manured for them, that they might not take Freemen from the
profession of Arms. Thus they receiving vast Revenues, and their Slaves
still multiplying, because they were not obliged to go to War: the most
powerful among them grew prodigiously rich, and the Country was filled
with Slaves, whereas there remained but very few of the Italian Nation,
and those few too were oppressed with poverty, by reason of the continual
Expeditions, in which they were forced to bear Arms, and the cruel
Exactions of the Tax-gatherers: and if at any time they had some respite
from their Sufferings, then Idleness corrupted them, having no Land of
their own to manure, nor finding any work from others, by reason of the
multitude of Slaves. This extremity troubled and perplexed both the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> who with grief beheld that they could not as
heretofore, upon any sudden occasion, draw together a considerable Force
of Italians, and they began to fear their Government unsecure, by reason
of the Countries being filled with such multitudes of Slaves. They sought
long time for a remedy to these inconveniencies; for they neither judged
it easie, nor indeed just to dislodge men, after so long a possession, from
those Lands where they had habituated themselves, and been at great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.
In conclusion, after much debate the Tribunes made a Law where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
all persons were prohibited from keeping more than five hundred Acres
of Land, one hundred Head of Cattle, and five hundred Sheep; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
they designed a certain number of free people to have the oversight
of the Tillage, and care of the Corn. This Law was confirmed by solemn
Oaths, and punishments decreed against the infringers of it: it was design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
likewise, that all those Lands possessed by any above the proportion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by the Law, should be equally distributed among the poor, but
neither Oaths nor Law prevailed. Those who appeared most zealous in
the observation of it, underhand made Contracts, conveying over their
advance to their Friends, and others publickly laughed at it, till such time
as <hi>Tiberius Gracchus</hi> of Noble Race, covetous of Glory, very eloquent, and
well known in the City for all these qualities, having obtained the Dignity
of Tribune, made a grave speech in favour of the Italian People, much
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65196:141"/>
lamenting that a Nation so warlike, and allyed to the Roman People,
should be reduced to so small numbers, and to such an oppressive poverty,
that there scarce appeared any remedy, but that they must be utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct.
Then he declared against the vast numbers of Slaves, useless in
War, and treacherous to their Masters, a fresh example of which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
of the Slaves, rebelling against their Patrons in <hi>Sicily,</hi> where the
Slaves being grown numerous by reason of their being employed in Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,
had raised such a War against the Romans, as was not suppressed
without much danger, and many bloody Engagements. This Speech did
the work, and gained a new publication of the Law concerning Lands,
whereby it was forbid any one to be possessed of more than five hundred
Acres, adding to it, that the Children of the Family might be possessed
of two hundred and fifty; and that after reduction made, the remaining
Land should be divided among the poor by Triumvirs, who were to be
changed every year, which sorely grieved the rich men, who durst no
more attempt any thing against the Law, nor for the future buy other mens
proportions; for <hi>Gracchus,</hi> to prevent frauds, had by the same Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
all such kind of Contracts, which occasioned, that in every corner
might be seen people got together, reproaching the poor with the pains
they had taken in manuring their Ground, and the charge they had been
at in building, crying out, that it was not just to make them lose, not only
their Lands, but likewise the money they had payed to their Neigbours,
and withal deprive them of the Sepulchres of their Predecessors, interred
in those grounds left to them by Succession. Others demanded the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of their Wives Dowry, which they had thus employed, or that their
Children might have leave to enjoy those Farms they had settled upon them
at their Marriage: others again shewed the Contracts and Statutes they
had entred into, taking up moneys at great interests to purchase those
Lands. In a word, all places were filled with murmuring and complaint.
On the other side, were heard the lamentings of the poor, that from rich,
that they once were, now they had reduced them to extreme poverty:
nay, even to despair, having nothing left to feed their Children, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the many Expeditions wherein they had served the Common-wealth,
to the end, they might maintain themselves in the possession of
these Lands, and vowed never to serve more, if they were not restored to
what belonged to them. They likewise accused the rich men, that they
disdained to employ them in their Tillage, but rather made choice of Slaves
their Enemies, faithless people, and useless in War. During these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
and mutual laments, the contagion of this Distemper spread it
it self among the Colonies, the Municipal Cities, and in all places where
Lands were possessed by what Title soever: every one feared to lose, and
there as well as in the City the multitude was divided into two parties, and
each relying on the number of their Faction, stirred them up against the
other; and all people being concerned in the execution of this Law: one
party disposing themselves to hinder it, and the other being ready to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any thing to maintain it, mens minds were strangely inclined to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
So neither one nor the other party resolving to yield, they waited
only the day appointed for the passing the Law in the Assembly.</p>

                  <hi>Gracchus</hi>'s Design was not so much to relieve the poverty of particular
men, as to repeople the Country, because he believed it the interest of the
Common-wealth, and that hereupon depended the fortune of all <hi>Italy:</hi>
nor doubted he of the success of the Enterprise, though it were as difficult
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65196:141"/>
as it was important. When the Assembly was met, after having a long
time discoursed the business in Question, he asked the Auditors, if they
believed it not just, that what belonged to the Publick should be shared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the People, if a Citizen were not to be preferred befor a Slave, if a
Soldier were no more serviceable to the State than a Ploughman, and if a
natural Inhabitant were not more affectionate to the Common-wealth than
a Stranger: and without insisting long upon these comparisons, as absurd,
he began to discourse of the hopes and fears of the City. That the Romans
had conqueeed many Countries, and been in hopes to extend their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
to the most distant Climates: but that as things now stood, there
was cause enough to doubt whether they should be able to complete the
Conquest of the rest, with that small number of Soldiers wherewith <hi>Italy</hi>
was peopled, or should not rather lose their own Country, by reason of the
weakness of their Armies, and the powerfulness of their Enemies, and
withal exaggerating the Glory and Riches on one side, and the danger and
fear on the other; he exhorted the rich men to consider with themselves
if it were not much more to the purpose willingly to quit to the unfortunate
poor who had great charge of Children the possession of some Lands, out
of hopes of those great advantages might thereby accrue, than to neglect
things of most import, by disputing Trifles. That besides five hundred
Acres of good Land well secured, and for those had Children, half as
much for every Head, was no contemptible recompence of their past Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.
After having largely discoursed on this subject; and the minds of
the poor people, and of all such as suffered themselves to be rather led by
reason than passion remaining suspended, he gave command to the Serjean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
to read the Law, when <hi>M. Octavius</hi> his Colleague, who was suborned by
the rich men to prevent the passing of the Law, imposed silence upon the
Serjeant. Whereupon <hi>Gracchus</hi> publickly reproaching him, adjourned the
Assembly till the morrow; when having caused some Armed Men to be
there, as if by force he would have constrained <hi>Octavius</hi> to yield to him,
whether he would or no; he with threats commanded the Serjeant to read
the Law, and <hi>Octavius</hi> on the contrary forbad him. Whereupon the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues
quarrelling, and it being impossible to read the Law by reason of the
Tumult, the most Considerate of the Assembly besought the Tribunes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Difference to the Senate's judgment. <hi>Gracchus</hi> consented; and out
of hopes that this Law would displease no reasonable man, went straight to
the Palace; but not being received there with so great applause as among
the Vulgar; nay, on the contrary, having reviling words cast at him by the
Rich Men, he returns to the Assembly, and promises that on the morrow he
would gather their Voices both concerning the Law, and the dismission of
his Colleague, who opposed the good of the People. He accordingly did
it: And as <hi>Octavius</hi> presented himself unconcerned, he first put it to the
Vote concerning him, The first Tribe having given their Vote against <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctavius,
Gracchus</hi> turned to him, and desired him to desist from his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize;
but seeing him obstinate, he persisted to demand the advice of the
rest; for at this time there were five and thirty, of which seventeen all in a
fury having voted with the first, if the eighteenth were joyned with them
the Law became ratified. Wherefore <hi>Gracchus</hi> once more publickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
his Colleague, now upon the very point of being deposed, not so
stubbornly to disturb a Work so holy and so beneficial to all Italians, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more oppose a thing which the people so ardently desired, the Execution
whereof his Office of Tribune obliged him to; and in fine, not to suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be deposed. After which Entreaties he called the Gods to witness,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65196:142"/>
that it was with regret he thus acted against the honour of his Colleague:
but then seeing nothing would perswade him, he began again to gather the
Votes. Thus <hi>Octavius</hi> being deprived of his Office and Charge, and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of the Assembly, they substituted <hi>Mummius</hi> in his stead; and at the
same time the Law was ratifyed. They created Triumvirs for dividing
the Land, <hi>Gracchus</hi> himself, <hi>Caius</hi> his Brother, and <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Law; for the people were fearful the Law might remain without
Execution, unless he that made it and his Alliance had the Support of it in
their own hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> As for <hi>Gracchus,</hi> ravished with joy that this Law had passed, he was
carried back by the people to his House, as if he had been the restorer not
of one City or one people, but of all the Nations of <hi>Italy.</hi> After which
the victorious Party went into the Countries from whence they were come
to this contention; and the other in despair for being overcome, staid still
in the City, publickly declaring that <hi>Gracchus</hi> should repent, as soon as he
was out of employment, the daring to violate an authority so holy and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
and be the mover of such a Sedition in <hi>Italy.</hi> Summer being alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
come, the time of the Assembly for the Creation of Tribunes drew nigh,
and it was very likely the rich men would so contrive it, that the dignity
might fall upon <hi>Gracchus</hi>'s enemies, which somewhat terrified him, and
fearful lest any thing might pass in the Assembly to his prejudice, he did his
endeavours to recal the people out of the Country. But all people being
now employed in their Tillage, as is usual in Harvest; and the day of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
approaching, he was forced to have recourse to the people of the
City; and with kindnesses and submissions solicite every one in particular,
to continue him in the Tribuneship, in acknowledgment of the dangers to
which he had exposed himself for their service. When it came to the
Vote, <hi>Gracchus</hi> had those of the two first Tribes: Whereupon the rich men
cryed out, that it was not allowed by Law to continue the same dignity in
the same Person: and <hi>Rubrius,</hi> Tribune of the people, whom Lot made
President of the Assembly, making a demur upon it, <hi>Mummius</hi> the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
of <hi>Octavius,</hi> obliged him to resign his place, and suffer him to gather
the Votes; but the rest of the Tribunes maintained that Lots ought again to
be drawn for the Preheminence, and that <hi>Rubrius</hi> Resignation could not be
made, but in equal favour of all the Tribunes. In this Contest <hi>Gracchus</hi>
seeing his Party the weakest, adjourned the Assembly till the morrow; and
finding his Affairs grow desperate, before he was dismissed of his Charge,
he spent the rest of that day in the place in mourning, having his Son with
him, whom he recommended to all he met, as foreseeing himself likely to
perish by the violence of his Enemies. The Rabble moved to compassion
for the man, and withal judging that there must be no more talk of Equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
between them and the other Citizens, but they must resolve to suffer the
Tyrannick Rule of the Rich if they forsook their Protector in the danger he
was in for their sakes, they carryed him to his house in the evening, and
wished him to be couragious next morning. Hereupon he took heart; and
assembling before it was day those of his Faction, gives them a word in
case there should be occasion to fight, and so seizes on the Capitol and place
of Assembly. The rich men, by the joyning of some Tribunes with them,
having hindred Votes to be taken about his Continuation, he gave to his
Party the Signal agreed upon between them: whereupon they rose with
great clamour, and straightway fell to blows; some gathering about his
Person as his Guards, and others tucking up their Robes, snatching the Rods
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65196:142"/>
out of the Lictors hands, and untying them, drave all the rich Men out of
the Assembly with many blows and wounds; in so much, that the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
affrighted fled, and the Priests shut up the Temple. The terror of
those who ran flying up and down, filled all the City with disorder and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
rumors. Some said <hi>Gracchus</hi> had taken the Tribuneship from his
Colleagues; which seemed the more credible, because none of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in publick: And others, that without expecting the people's Votes,
he had created himself Tribune. Mean while the Senate assembled in the
Temple of Faith. And surely it is to me a wonder, that neither now nor
afterwards it entred into the thoughts of any of the Fathers, to propose the
saving way of a Dictator, so often tryed in the like Commotions. After a
short Consultation they ascended the Capitol, led by <hi>Cornelius Scipio Nasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
High Priest; who having cryed aloud, that all who loved the safety of
the Commonwealth should follow him, cast one of the Skirts of his Robe
over his shoulder and over his head; whether for a sign to assemble the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
or to give them Signal of Battel, or to testifie his respect to the
Gods, in concealing from them the design he had in his heart. Being come
to the Capitol, and <hi>Gracchus</hi> people having made way for that great Man
at the head of the Senate; those that followed him snatcht the Clubs out of
their Enemies hands; and getting pieces of Forms which they broke, or
any thing that might serve for offence, they fell upon the others with so
much fury, that they drove the greatest part of them down the Precipices,
and slew <hi>Gracchus</hi> himself near the Temple Gates before the Statues of their
Kings, with a great number of his followers; whose bodies were in the
night cast into <hi>Tyber.</hi> Thus ended <hi>Gracchus,</hi> Son to a Father that had been
twice Consul; and to <hi>Cornelia,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Scipio</hi> the Affrican. He was
slain being Tribune, and in the Capitol, serving his Country but with too
much violence. And this Riot, the most infamous we have upon Record,
was committed in the sacred place where Magistrates are chosen. His
death wrought two different effects in men's minds; some rejoyced, and
others mourned, for many lamented not less their own condition than his;
calling the present State not the Republick, but the Insolence of the victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Party; whilst others, believing they had nothing more to fear, found
themselves at the top of their wishes. All this happened in the time of that
War, when <hi>Aristonicus</hi> fought with the people of <hi>Rome</hi> for the Empire of
<hi>Asia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After <hi>Gracchus</hi> death, <hi>Appius</hi> being likewise deceased, <hi>Fulvius Flaccus</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
and <hi>Papirius Carbo,</hi> together with the young <hi>Gracchus,</hi> undertook to cause
the Law about Lands to be put in Execution. And when the ancient Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors
stood off what they could to hinder the Arpentage or Division of
Lands, they caused Proclamation to be made, that whosoever would might
summon them before them, which gave Rise to numberless difficult Law-Suits;
for all contiguous Lands that either had been sold or divided, fell into
dispute, to know how they were sold or divided: no Writing of Sale ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
and many having lost the Possession of what was let out to them by
Division; and besides, whatever did appear done by contract, was very
doubtful. And moreover, in making a general Survey, in order to a new
Division, some who had sowed or otherwise improved their Farms, were
transplanted to a corner that at present lay Fallow; and others from Arable,
to a Wast, Clay or Marshy Ground. For from the first, there had been no
very exact Division made of the Lands gained from the Enemy. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was enacted that Lands so set out should be tilled by the Possessors,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65196:143"/>
some that were more diligent had advanced upon their Neighbours, and so
confounded the Bounds: Besides, time having changed the face of places,
it was no easie matter to discover the Incroachments of the rich Men, though
they were very great. In a word, by the often change of Dwellings, all
things were in confusion and disorder. The Italians, tired with their Law-Suits,
and feeling themselves oppressed with the Execution of Judgments;
that they might be no longer subject to these Injustices, besought <hi>Cornelius
Scipio</hi> the African to undertake their Protection. They had served him so
well in many occasions of War, that he could not refuse them his Assistance:
He therefore went to the Senate; where at first dash he struck not directly
at the Law for fear to offend the people; but having touched somewhat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the difficulty of the Affair, he moved that the cognizance of such Causes
as should happen might be taken from the Tribunes as Men suspected, and
others be sent in their stead. His Opinion being found very just, the Senate
confirmed it by Decree; and gave the Commission to <hi>Tuditanus,</hi> then Consul.
But he having undertaken a business which he found very difficult, taking
for a pretence the War of <hi>Illyria,</hi> went into that Province; and no man
longer acknowledging the Triumvirs for Judges, all matters were at a stand.
This lost <hi>Scipio</hi> in the hearts of the Common People; who believed that this
Man, for whose sake they had often offended the prime Men of the City, and
without consideration of the Law, twice made Consul; now served the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian
Allies to their prejudice. Which coming to the knowledge of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s
Enemies, they ran up and down the Streets, exclaiming that he was resolved
to abolish the Law by Arms, and by the Massacre of the Citizens; and thus
they terrified the multitude. In short, <hi>Scipio</hi> being one evening retired into
his Chamber, with Table-Books to write, during the night, an Oration he
was to make to the Assembly, was found dead without the appearance of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Wound: Whether he were poysoned by <hi>Cornelia,</hi> the Mother of the
<hi>Gracchi</hi> (who feared lest this Law should be abrogated) having for an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complice <hi>Sempronia</hi> her Daughter, <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Wife; who being ugly and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
was neither beloved, nor loved him: Or whether (as some believed)
he gave himself this death, because he saw he could not perform what he
promised. Though there be others say that his Slaves under Torment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
that some unknown men they had let in at the back door, had strangl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him; and that they durst not discover the Murther, because they knew
the people hating <hi>Scipio,</hi> rejoyced at his death. Thus died that man, so ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to the Roman Empire, for whom no publick Funerals were celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
so much did present Indignation transcend the power of those Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments
the people owed to his past Services. And this gave occasion of
encrease to the Seditions about the Law concerning Lands.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> Mean while the Division of Lands was delayed by reason of several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues
practised by those in Possession: And some were of opinion that
the Freedom of the City should be given to all those Allies principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
to make them by that favour quit all other pretences. The Italians
were herewith well content; and much rather would have chose the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
offered, than the new Division they demanded. <hi>Fulvius Flaccus,</hi> now
Consul, and likewise Triumvir for the Execution of the Law, stood stiffly
to this Proposition. But the Senate could not endure that the Subjects of
<hi>Rome</hi> should be made equal to her Citizens: So there it stopped to the great
displeasure of those people, troubled to see their hopes frustrate. Matters
standing thus; <hi>Caius,</hi> Brother to the Elder <hi>Gracchus,</hi> and heretofore his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league
in the Triumvirate, offered himself very seasonably to be Tribune.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65196:143"/>
He had layen still some time after his Brother's death, contemned by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
against whom he could not defend his Authority. But having put
himself in the number of those who stood for the Tribuneship, he carried it
roundly to the general satisfaction of the people; and forthwith began to
put in practice all ways possible to revenge himself of the Senate: For he
made a Law, that every Month a certain quantity of Wheat should be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to the people by head, at the publick Expence. This had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
been practised. So that having suddainly gained the people by this
new Establishment; and withal, being supported by <hi>Fulvius Flaccus,</hi> he
was again chosen Tribune for the Year following. For it was already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
by an express Law, that if it were necessary for a Tribune to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in order to the perfecting of something begun, he ought to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before any of the Competitors in the next Assembly. This Dignity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then prolonged to him for the following Year, and the people already
engaged to him for the fore-cited favour, he cast about, how to gratifie the
Knights the next Order after the Supreme, and proposed the Transferring
to this Order, the Cognizance of all Concussion, publick Extortion, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Management of Offices and Charges; reproaching them with the fresh
Examples of <hi>Aurelius, Cotta, Salinator</hi> and <hi>Manlius Aquilius,</hi> Conqueror of
<hi>Asia:</hi> All which being accused of mis-employing the publick Treasure, had
been cleared by the Corruption of their Judges; which was likewise attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Deputies of the Provinces still in the City, and loudly complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Injustice done them. The Senators were so ashamed to hear these
discourses, that they never opposed the publick Decree; so that the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of those Crimes was consigned over to the Knights: And it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that at the ratifying this Law <hi>Gracchus</hi> was heard say, <hi>That the power of
the Senate was throughly quashed.</hi> And indeed the consequences proved the
saying true: for another Order being henceforward Judges, both of the
Affairs of the City, and of <hi>Italy;</hi> nay, even of the Senators themselves:
whether the Question were concerning a Pecuniary Fine, or Condemning
to Banishment or Infamy, the whole power seemed to be in the hands of
the Knights, and the Senate reduced to depend on them. Besides, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Knights contributing to the Election of the Tribunes of the people,
and the Tribunes being ready to return them kindness for kindness, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
began to be started; and there wanted very little but by overturning
the whole Frame of the Commonwealth, the Knights had had all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in effect, leaving the Senate only the Honour and Shew: For some
time after not only this Supreme Order was submitted to the Knights, but
the Senators daily received Injustices from their Judges; who tickled with
the sweetness of the profit they had now tasted, abused their Power with
all sorts of infamy and disorder. They suborned Accusers against the Rich;
and entring into a Cabal, eluded those Laws made against corrupt Judges,
or with scorn contemned them. Hence came it, that because no account
was required of their Proceedings, a new Sedition was raised, because of
Judiciary Laws, which proved not less than others, and likewise lasted some
time. <hi>Gracchus</hi> likewise set on work the Levelling, Paving and Repairing
the High ways of all <hi>Italy,</hi> wherein he employed Multitudes of people liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only by Day-labour; whom by this means he perfectly gained to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
any thing for his Service. He founded several Colonies; and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Latines to demand a Right of Freedom of the City; alledging it
was an unworthy thing for the Senate to hinder what people, their Allies,
desired with so much passion; and at last he gave to other Allies a Right to
give in their Votes, contrary to ancient Custom, because he hoped to make
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65196:144"/>
use of them in the Publication of Laws he designed to prefer. This more
allarmed the Senate than all had passed before. Wherefore after a Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
the Consuls published their Defences, forbidding all persons not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Right to vote to stay in the City, or to come within the<note n="*" place="margin">Five Miles</note> fifth Stone.
They likewise drew in <hi>Livius Drusus</hi> to oppose all Laws proposed by <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
his Colleague, without giving any reason of his Opposition before the
people; which liberty they likewise gave to all Opposers whatsoever. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to sweeten the Multitude, they granted them twelve Colonies; which
Concession so charmed their minds, that they began to disgust the new Laws.
So that <hi>Gracchus</hi> frustrated of the people; and <hi>Fulvius Flaccus,</hi> a Consular,
who had been made <hi>Gracchus</hi> his Colleague, went over for the same reason
into <hi>Africa;</hi> where by reason of the fertility of the Soyl, a Colony was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to be established, and Inhabitants expresly sent thither, that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
being disburthened, the Senate might in some measure be delivered from
popular Seditions. The Tribunes set out the place of their Habitation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Ruins of <hi>Carthage;</hi> without consideration that <hi>Scipio,</hi> when he
demolished it, had decreed it to remain eternally desert, with Imprecations
against all those who should attempt to rebuild it. They likewise made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to bring over six thousand Inhabitants more than were appointed by
Ordinance of the Senate, to gain so much the more the people's good grace.
From thence they returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> with design to gather together from all
parts of <hi>Italy</hi> those six thousand persons destined for <hi>Carthage.</hi> But those
who stayed in <hi>Africa,</hi> to lay the first Foundations to that Colony; having
writ to the City that the Wolves had tore away the Mark set by the Tribunes,
the Augurs declared it Sacrilege to send Inhabitants thither, and the Senate
published an Assembly to consult of the Abrogation of the Law in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to that Colony. Whereupon <hi>Gracchus</hi> and <hi>Fulvius</hi> having likewise
lost this hope, ran like mad men through the Streets, crying out that the
Prodigy of the Wolves was a lye of the Senate's. The most resolute of the
people took their parts; and armed, they came to the Capitol, where the
Tribes were in Convocation to give their Votes, touching the Colony. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the people were assembled, and <hi>Fulvius</hi> had begun to speak, <hi>Gracchus,</hi>
who to that end had ordered his people to follow, attempted to go up to the
Temple of <hi>Iupiter;</hi> but being hindred by those who knew he had some ill
design, he returned no more into the Assembly, but retreated into the Porch,
waiting an opportunity to engage the adverse Party. Mean while a certain
man of the people called <hi>Attilius,</hi> who sacrificed under the same Porch, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him moved, went to accost him: and whether knowing any thing, or
having some suspition, or else only by way of entertainment, besought him
to have compassion of his Country: Whereupon seeming troubled as if he
had been discovered; and looking awry upon the man, one of his followers,
without receiving any Command, or staying for a Signal; but judging by
his Master's Countenance that it was time to strike, and that by beginning
first, he would be the more obliged to him; drew his Sword, and run <hi>Atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
into the Belly. Whereupon, a great cry being raised, when the dead
body was seen upon the Pavement, all the people were affrighted, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man fled from the Temple as fast as he could. <hi>Gracchus</hi> went into the
Assembly, to give an account of this Action; but when none would hear his
Justification, but all looked upon him as impious and irreligious. <hi>Flaccus</hi>
and he, troubled to have lost the opportunity of executing their design, went
to their several Homes, whither others of the same Faction retired to them.
The rest of the people, as it happens in a publick Tumult, being about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
got together in Arms in the place, <hi>Opimius,</hi> one of the Consuls, who
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65196:144"/>
was left in the City, at break of day places Guards in the Capital, gives or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to call together the Senate, and himself seizes on the Temple of <hi>Castor</hi>
ano <hi>Pollux,</hi> which stood in the heart of the City; that he might be in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
whatever should happen. Things disposed in this order, the Senate
sent to summon <hi>Gracchus</hi> and <hi>Flaccus,</hi> to come and give an account of their
Actions: but they having betaken themselves to Arms, hastned to seize on
the Mount <hi>Aventine;</hi> hoping if they made themselves Masters of that place,
the Senate would not refuse some conditions of Peace. They endeavoured
likewise to raise the Slaves under promise of Liberty, but in vain. So they
fortifyed themselves in <hi>Diana</hi>'s Temple with those people they had; from
whence they sent <hi>Quintus</hi> the Son of <hi>Flaccus</hi> to the Senate, to treat of an
Accommodation. Answer was given, they should lay down their Arms
and come themselves, and then they should be heard; but that upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
terms they should send no more. But <hi>Quintus</hi> again returning, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to this Declaration made him by the Senate, <hi>Opimius</hi> no more considering
him as a Deputy, commands him to be Arrested, and at the same instant
gave Order to march against <hi>Gracchus;</hi> who fled over the wooden Bridge,
to the other side of <hi>Tiber,</hi> into a certain Thicket, followed only by one
Slave; to whom, because he would not fall alive into his Enemies hands, he
presented his throat. <hi>Flaccus</hi> escaped into a Shop of one of his Friends,
where his Pursuers lost him; but because they knew not which House he
was run into, they threatned to burn the whole Street: Whereupon, he
who had received him not having the heart to deliver him up himself, gave
notice to another, who discovered him. So he was taken, and slain upon
the place. The two heads were brought to <hi>Opimius,</hi> who pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed for them
their weight in Gold. Their Houses were pillaged by the people, and their
Fellow-Confederates strangled in the Prison by the Consul's Order. As for
<hi>Quintus</hi> the Son of <hi>Flaccus,</hi> they gave him leave to chuse his death. After
which, the usual Ceremonies for purging the City, polluted by these Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacres,
were performed; and by Decree of the Senate, the Temple of
Concord was built in the place.</p>
               <p>The second Sedition of the <hi>Gracchi</hi> ending in this manner, soon after a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/>
Law was made, by which it was permitted to any to sell their Lands, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the defence made by the elder <hi>Gracchus;</hi> so that the Poor were soon
thrust out by the Rich of all that they possessed in the Country, either by
Power or Money; till such time as <hi>Spurius Borius</hi> absolutely abolished the
Law of Lands; leaving the Country in possession of the ancient Masters, on
condition of paying a Tribute to the People, and the Money arising thereby
to be divided by head; which was a great comfort to the Poor, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
against unpeopling the Country. Thus <hi>Gracchus</hi> Laws, very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
to the Commonwealth if they could have been executed, being
once shaken, another Tribune of the People took off the Tribute; so that
there remained nothing to the poor People. Hence proceeded it that the
Country became depopulated, Soldiers grew scarce, the Revenue of the
Roman People diminished, Military Establishments were reduced, the
Laws lost their Authority, ano Men ceased to do Justice. And this was fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
years after the Publication of the Law concerning Lands. About the
same time the Consul <hi>Scipio</hi> caused the Theatre begun by <hi>L. Cassius,</hi> to be
demolished, though almost brought to perfection, (whether he thought it
might breed new matter of Sedition, or whether he thought it not for the
Commonwealths good to accustom the People to the Grecians Voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.)
And the Censor <hi>Q. Cecilius Metellus</hi> did all he could to expel <hi>Glaucia</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65196:145"/>
and <hi>Apuleius Saturninus,</hi> who had been Tribune, out of the Senate, for their
debauched life; but his Colleague opposing it, he could not succeed in the
Attempt. For this reason <hi>Apuleius,</hi> to revenge this Affront of <hi>Metellus,</hi>
once more demanded the Tribuneship; and took the opportunity when
<hi>Glaucia,</hi> then Praetor, presided in the Assembly. Notwithstanding, <hi>Noni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
of Noble Race, having with bloody Reproaches declaimed against <hi>Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leius</hi>
and <hi>Glaucia,</hi> was designed Tribune. But they fearing lest he having
obtained that Dignity, should handle them roughly, broke up the Assembly;
and presently slipped after him a Troop of Murtherers, who reached him as
he was escaping into a certain House, and slew him. And because this Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
struck all the World both with horrour and compassion, those of <hi>Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi>'s
Faction being got very early in the morning about him in the place of
the Assembly, before the people were come, gave the Tribuneship to <hi>Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leius:</hi>
So no more Inquest was made after <hi>Nonius</hi> death, none daring to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
the Tribune of such a Riot. <hi>Metellus</hi> was likewise sent into Banishment
by a Cabal of his Enemies, upheld by <hi>Marius,</hi> now the sixth time Consul,
who bare him a private Grudge. And this was the Trap they layd for
him: <hi>Apuleius</hi> made a Law touching the Division of Lands in the Province
of the Gauls, out of which <hi>Marius</hi> had lately driven the Cimbrians; so
that now it was under dependence of the Romans, and not of the Gauls: By
this Law it was enacted, that if the People passed it, the Senate should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it in ten days, and by Oath oblige themselves to stand to it; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
would not swear, to be expelled the Senate, with twenty Talents
Fine. Thus an opportunity of Revenge presented of it self; for there was
not any likelihood that many of the Senators, but especially <hi>Metellus,</hi> Noble
minded as he was, would endure to be forced to swear. <hi>Apuleius</hi> appointed
a day of Assembly; and mean time sent Messengers from himself, to give
notice to the Tribes in the Country, in whom he had great confidence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the greater part of them had born Arms under <hi>Marius.</hi> This Law
which seemed made in favour of the Allies, was not very pleasing to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
People. So that no Order was kept in this Assembly; and whosoever
stood up against it, was thrown headlong down by <hi>Apuleius.</hi> Hereupon
the People of the City began to cry out that they heard thunder, as often as
which happens, it is Sacrilege to enact any thing. But when <hi>Apuleius</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
gave not yet over their Violences, the Citizens trussing up their Gowns,
and seizing on the Arms of all they met, dispersed the Country-men; who,
notwithstanding, being recalled by <hi>Apuleius,</hi> Rallyed, and returning to the
Charge with Clubs likewise in their hands, made such a bustle, that at length
the Law past. That done, <hi>Marius</hi> assembled the Senate to consult about
the Oath demanded from the Senators; and because he knew <hi>Metellus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and steady in his Resolutions, he spoke his opinion first, and assured
them he would never willingly swear; <hi>Metellus</hi> did the like: and the rest
of the Senate praising both one and the other, the Consul dismissed the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly:
but on the fifth day, the time prescribed by the Law to swear on,
<hi>Marius</hi> having about ten of the Clock assembled the Senate in great haste,
told them he was afraid of the People, eager for the Execution of the Law;
but that he had found a device to secure them: That they ought to swear to
that Law so far as it was legitimate; with which the Country People, whom
they had most cause to apprehend, being satisfied, would be gone; and
then it would be very easie to make it appear to be no Law, being published
by force, and whilst it thundred, contrary to the Customs of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.
And having thus said, without staying to ask any one's opinion, or
so much as giving time to think of it; whilst all kept silence through fear
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65196:145"/>
and surprize, he rises up and goes to the Temple of <hi>Saturn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> where the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers
of the Exchequer were to swear them; and first of all himself and
Friends oblige themselves by Oath to the Observation of the Law. All the
rest of the Senators, every one in fear for himself, swore likewise, save only
<hi>Metellus,</hi> who remained stedfast and fearless in his Resolution. So <hi>Apuleius</hi>
next morning caused in Usher to lay hold of him, to make him go out of the
Palace; and when the other Tribunes of the People commanded the Usher
to let him go, he ran to the Country Men, and told them they could have no
Lands, nor would the Law be of force unless <hi>Metellus</hi> were driven out of the
City. In so much that it was decreed in the Assembly of the people that he
should be banished, and that the Consuls should forbid him Fire and Water;
and they allowed one day to the Senate, to consider of the matter. The Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
enraged at this Action, assembled with Arms under their Gowns, to
conduct him through the City. But he thanking them for their good will,
with all the Civilities imaginable, told them he would never suffer his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
to run any hazard for his sake. Then <hi>Apuleius</hi> published the Ordinance
for his Banishment, which <hi>Marius</hi> soon confirmed by Decree. And thus
this man, esteemed by all the World, went into Exile.</p>
               <p>After this <hi>Apuleius</hi> was again nominated Tribune of the people for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/>
third year, and they chose for his Colleague one, who most said, was a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive
Slave, and who boasted himself to be Son to the elder <hi>Gracchus,</hi> for
whom all the rabble gave their votes with much eagerness, out of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
they had to the said <hi>Gracchus.</hi> After this, was held an Assembly for
the election of Consuls, where <hi>Anthony,</hi> by general consent of all the
world was nominated to this Dignity. 'Twas not yet known who of <hi>Glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi>
or <hi>Memmius</hi> that strove for it, should be his Colleague; but because
<hi>Memmius</hi> was of much the better House, <hi>Glaucia</hi> and <hi>Apuleius</hi> fearful he
should carry it, caused him to be set upon in the very assembly of the People,
by certain Murtherers, who in the face of the whole world slew him with
Clubs; so that by reason of this disorder, the Assembly broke up, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
beheld the violation of all that respect due to the authority of the Laws,
to Justice, to Men and to God. On the morrow the people incensed with
the horrour of the Action, gathered together to punish it in the person of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puleius,</hi> but he assisted by great numbers of the Country people, whom
he had caused to come of purpose, and taking along with him <hi>Glaucia</hi> and
<hi>C. Sanfeius</hi> Quaestor went to seise the Capitol. The Senate declares them
Enemies, and <hi>Marius</hi> with regret arms against them; but so few people,
and so slowly, that the people tired with his delays, cut the Pipes which
carried water to the Temple, till <hi>Sanfeius</hi> no longer able to endure thirst,
gave advice to fire the Capitol, but <hi>Glaucia</hi> and <hi>Apuleius,</hi> out of the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
they had in <hi>Marius,</hi> yielded first, and <hi>Sanfeius</hi> after them: but
when the people cryed out with one voice to put them presently to death,
the Consul shut them up in the Palace, under pretence to punish them by
form of Justice: the multitude thinking it a Fiction, climbing up on the
Roof of the Palace, and pulling off the covering, never left throwing
down Tyles on the Heads of those within, till the Quaestor, Tribune and
Praetor lost their lives, having yet on the Habits and Badges of their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy.
All the rest of their party perished likewise in the same tumult,
and among others, the Tribune who said he was Son to <hi>Gracchus</hi> on the first
day of his Tribuneship. No person could any longer promise himself to
preserve his liberty, there was now only the shadow of a Common-wealth,
no regard being had to Laws or Dignity, or Magistracy, since the holy
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65196:146"/>
and sacred power of the Tribunes, which was established to oppose Riots
and Murders, and to protect the people, was become polluted with the
crimes of those which exercised it, and violated by the outrages which
they received from others. After they were thus rid of the Tribunes, all
the Senate and People of <hi>Rome</hi> began to demand the repeal of <hi>Metellus,</hi>
save only <hi>P. Furius,</hi> whose Father was but a Freed-man, who
opposed it with boldness, and would never be moved from this opposition,
though <hi>Metellus</hi> the Son of him banished, besought him on his Knees, with
tears in his Eyes, which was the cause that this Son whom all men saw in
that condition, so worthy of compassion, got the Sirname of <hi>Pious,</hi> and
that <hi>C. Canuleius</hi> the Tribune, offended at <hi>Furius</hi> his obstinacy, undertook
to cause him to be condemned to death by the people, and pleaded his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
so vehemently, that without hearing the Accused's defence, the
incensed multitude tore him in pieces: so ordinary it was now grown, day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to commit some new murder, in the place designed to do justice: at
length they agreed to <hi>Metellus</hi>'s return; and it is said, that when he entred
the City, the whole day was not sufficient to receive the Complements of
those went to meet him at the Gate. Thus the stirs made by <hi>Apuleius</hi> in
<hi>Rome,</hi> were the third in order after those Tempests raised under the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buneship
of the two <hi>Gracchi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> Mean while began the Social War, by the conspiracy of all the Nations
of <hi>Italy,</hi> which not being foreseen, and increasing prodigiously in a short
time, put some stop to Domestick Seditions, by the fresh terrour it brought.
After it was ended, other flames of Division were kindled between the
chief Heads of the Common-wealth, which were not quenched by making
new Laws, or raising sudden tumults; for they charged each other at the
Head of mighty Armies. I have especially thought fit to insert this War
in this History, as well because it took birth from a popular tumult, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was followed by another Dissention, much more pernicious to the
Common-wealth than any of the former. It began then in this manner,
<hi>Fulvius Flaccus</hi> being Consul, was the first that ever blew up the desires of
Freedom in the minds of the Allies, out of hopes to be no longer subject to
the Romans. but to share with them the Honours and Dignities of the
City; and because he was obstinate in this proposition, the Senate sent him
to a certain War, where the time of his Consulate being expired, he came to
demand the Tribuneship, and prevailed so, that they gave him young
<hi>Gracchus</hi> for his Colleague. Both one and the other being slain for making
Laws of that kind in favour of the Italians, as we have already related, the
spirits of the Allies were imbittered more and more, incensed, that they
were treated rather like Vassals than Allies, and that <hi>Fulvius</hi> and <hi>Gracchus</hi>
had perished so miserably, for declaring themselves their Protectors. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them <hi>Livius Drusus</hi> Tribune of the People, of Noble Race, upon the
request of the Allies, promised, to pass the Law they desired,
touching the right of Freedom: for it was all they longed for, having no
other way to become Masters as well as the others, to whom now they
were but Subjects. Mean while, the Tribune, to gain the favour of the
People, settled many Colonies in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> in pursuance of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Decree which had till that time lain dormant. He undertook like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to reconcile the Senate and Knights, mightily imbroiled about the
cognizance of crimes of concussion assigned to the Knights. He could not
openly restore it to the Senators, wherefore he devised this stratagem,
whereby he thought to content both one and the other. The number of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65196:146"/>
the Senators not amounting to above three hundred, by reason of all the
past Seditions, he made a Law, ordaining the taking a like number of
Knights of the worthiest men to fill up the Senate, and that all these toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should for the future chuse Judges, before whom all that were suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Corruption or Concussion, should appear to give account of their
Actions; for that mischief was now so common, that men forbore to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it a crime, so boundless was impudence grown. But this design suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
quite contrary to his imaginations; for the Senators thought it
strange, that in a moment so many Knights should be mounted with them
to the supreme Order, who probably seeing themselves raised to a new
Dignity, would never well accord with the ancient Standers. And the
Knights, who had tasted of profit and power, feared, (and that surely with
reason) lest by this means all the authority should be restored to the Senate, to
their detriment. Besides, it raised a jealousie between the Knights them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
for no man could resolve to yield that to another (as more worthy)
which he thought himself well deserved; and most certain it is, no one
could be preferred, but with the Envy and Hate of all the rest. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
disturbed them more than the Prosecutions which ought to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
against those who had suffered themselves to be corrupted by Bribes, the
practice of which seemed quite abrogated. So that though the two Orders
were at no good accord among themselves, yet they agreed in this point,
equally to hate <hi>Drusus;</hi> and there were none but the People satisfied with
him, and that because of the Colonies. For the Allies themselves, though
the Tribune had done all these things with design to serve them, had an
aversion to the Law of Colonies, because if the Lands were not divided,
the rich men seised them partly by force, and partly by cunning, framing
Intreagu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s with their Neigbours to enlarge their own bounds, by driving
them from their proper Inheritances. The contagion of these Disorders
had spread it self even to<note n="*" place="margin">Tuscany.</note> 
                  <hi>Hetruria</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">Dutchy of <hi>Spoletto.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Umbria,</hi> whose people whom the
Consuls had caused to come into the City, (in appearance to oppose the
publication of the Law, but indeed to rid themselves of <hi>Drusus</hi>) cryed
out publickly, that they waited for the Assembly, which being come to
the Tribunes knowledge, he went very seldom abroad in publick, but held
his ordinary audiences at his House in a kind of a dark Gallery, where one
Evening, as he dismissed the multitude, he cryed out he was wounded,
and at the same instant falling, was found struck in the Thigh, and a Shooe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
Knife in the Wound. Thus <hi>Drusus</hi> as well as others was slain in
his Tribuneship.</p>
               <p>The Knights were not wanting to draw advantages against their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/>
out of <hi>Drusus</hi> his Designs, and to find out matter of Calumny, and
to this effect they perswaded <hi>Q. Valerius</hi> Tribune of the People to make a
Law, declaring all such Criminals, who openly or underhand favoured the
Allies, in their design to enter into the Government of the Republick, out
of hopes soon to expose to their Accusers the Head Men of the City, to
become the Judges of this crime<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so odious to all Citizens, to destroy their
Enemies, and make themselves almighty; wherefore when the other Tribunes
opposed the publication of this Law, the Knights all drew their Swords,
and presenting the points to the Throats of the Opposers, made them pass it
by force. That done, they presently suborned Accusers against the most
considerable of the Senate. <hi>Bestia,</hi> one of the first accused, would not come
at their Summons, but went of himself into exile, rather than submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the power of his Enemies. <hi>Cotta,</hi> called next to judgment after him,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65196:147"/>
appeared, but after he had given a brave account of the Employments he
had undergone in the Republick, and declared against the Knights, he left
the City without staying for their Sentence. <hi>Mummius</hi> sirnamed the <hi>Achaick,</hi>
after having been fooled by his Judges, who promised to absolve him, was
banished to <hi>Delos,</hi> where he ended his days. This mischief falling upon
the worthiest and best men, the People began to be afflicted to see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in so short time robbed of the presence of so many great persons,
and the Allies when they knew of <hi>Drusus</hi>'s Death, and the cause of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of so many illustrious men, thought it was no longer time to suffer
their Protectors to be so unworthily treated; and seeing no other way to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in their hopes, resolved to revolt against the Roman People, and to
make War upon them with all their power. To this purpose they sent se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Deputations to each other, signed an Union, and gave reciprocal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages,
of all which they had but late notice in the City, now wholly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
in trials and tumults. At last when they had advice of it, they sent
into all corners the properest people they could find out, to discover the
truth of this news, under pretence of doing something else; one of which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spying
a Child of <hi>Ascoly</hi> in another City, whither he had been sent for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stage,
advised <hi>Servilius</hi> thereof, who governed as Proconsul in those
Quarters: from whence we may gather that even from those times the
Countries of <hi>Italy</hi> were distributed to Proconsuls, a custom which many
ages after the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> revived, though not to last long after his
death. <hi>Servilius</hi> came forthwith to <hi>Ascoly,</hi> when the Inhabitants happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to celebrate a Solemn Festival, where whilst he thought to frighten them
with his threats, when they perceived the League was discovered, they
slew him, and with him <hi>Fonteius</hi> his Lieutenant. After having begun
with them they spared no Roman, but put all to the Sword, and plundered
their Goods. Thus they proceeded to an open Revolt, and all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
People took Arms, the Marsians, the Pelignians, the Vestins and
the Marucians, who were followed by the<note n="*" place="margin">The Marches of <hi>Ancoma.</hi>
                  </note> Picenians, the Ferentins, the
Hirpins, the Pompeians, the Venusines, the Apulians, the<note n="*" place="margin">Those of the <hi>Basili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</hi>
                  </note> Lucanians
and the<note n="*" place="margin">Abruzzo.</note> Samnites, all Nations long time Enemies to the Roman Name.
And in short, all the people from the River<note n="*" place="margin">Gariglia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.</note> 
                  <hi>Liris,</hi> which I believe is at
this day called <hi>Literva,</hi> to the bottom of the Adriatick Gulf, as well within
Land, as on the Sea-Coasts. Their Deputies going to <hi>Rome</hi> to complain
that the right of Freedom was not granted them, though by their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
and Services they had highly contributed to the increase of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
The Senate answered them very roughly, that when they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to their duty, they would hear their Deputations, but otherwise
they would give them no audience; so fallen from all hopes, they prepared
for War, raised Forces, and set out a hundred thousand men as well Horse
as Foot. The Roman Army was not less numerous, comprizing those Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
continued faithful to them: <hi>Sext. Iulius Caesar</hi> and <hi>P. Rutilius Lapus</hi>
Consuls, commanded for the Romans; for this Intestine War was thought
so important, that they put them both in Commission. They began to
keep Guards at the Gates for the security of the City, and likewise of the
Neighbours; for since these Novelties were sent on foot, they knew not
whom to trust. There was great likelyhood of division, even in the City
it self. To the Consuls they appointed Lieutenants, the greatest men of
the Age, <hi>A. Rabirius, Cn. Pompey</hi> Father to him gained the Sirname of
<hi>Great, Q. Cepio, C. Perpenna, C. Marius, Valerius Messala, A. Sextus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,
P. Lentulus</hi> his Brother, <hi>T. Didius, Licinius Crassus, Cornelius Sylla</hi> and
<hi>Marcus Marcellus.</hi> To each they assigned his Quarter with the authority
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65196:147"/>
of Proconsul, and from time to time sent them Recruits, so dangerous did
this War appear: as for the Allies, besides particular Captains chosen by
every City, they gave command to <hi>T. Afranius, P. Ventridius, M. Egna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
Q. Popedius, C. Papius, M. Lamponius, C. Iudacilius, Hirius Asinius,</hi>
and <hi>Vetius Cato</hi> who likewise divided the Forces among them, and took e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one his portion to make Head against the Roman Forces. There hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
several Defeats on both sides, which I will succincty relate. <hi>Vetius
Cato</hi> killed two thousand of <hi>Sextus Iulius</hi> his Men, and forced him to shut
himself up in <hi>Isernia,</hi> (which remained firm to the Roman Alliance)
with the remainder of his Forces, of whom <hi>L. Acilius</hi> and <hi>L. Scipio</hi> got
thence in Slaves Habit, the rest pressed with hunger, yielded at discretion.
<hi>Marius Egnatius</hi> took <hi>Venafra</hi> by treason, and cut in pieces two Roman
Cohorts. <hi>P. Presenteius</hi> encountring <hi>Perpenna</hi> with ten thousand Men, put
him to flight with the slaughter of four thousand, and taking most of the
others Arms, who threw them away to hasten their Flight. Wherefore
the Consul <hi>Rutilius</hi> took the Command from <hi>Perpenna,</hi> and gave the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of his Army to <hi>C. Marius; M. Lamponius</hi> engaging <hi>Licinius Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
killed eight hundred of his men upon the place, and pursued the rest
fighting, as far as<note n="*" place="margin">Clarimont<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Grumentum; C. Papius</hi> possessed himself of <hi>Nola,</hi> which
was delivered up, and made offer to two thousand Romans that were there
in Garrison, to receive them into his Army if they would joyn party with
him, which they accepted all, save the Officers, whom he put in prison
where they died by Famine. The same took <hi>Stabia, Minterna</hi> and <hi>Salerna,</hi>
which were a Colony of the Romans, and gave employment in his Army
to all the Inhabitants of those Towns, and likewise to their Slaves, after
which, having spoiled all the Country of <hi>Nocera,</hi> the Neighbouring Cities
yielded to him for fear of the spoil, and sent him ten thousand Footmen,
and one thousand Horse, which he had demanded of them, with which
Recruits he went and besieged <hi>Acerra: Sextus Caesar</hi> came with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Gaul Foot, and the Numidian Horse, and encamped near unto <hi>Papius,</hi>
who, to debauch the Numidians from the Roman Party, took <hi>Oxinta</hi> Son
of <hi>Iugurtha,</hi> formerly King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> out of the Prisons of <hi>Venusa,</hi>
where he was kept, caused him to be cloathed in Purple, and to shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to his Subjects; insomuch that the Consul perceiving that some of the
Numidians were dayly running away to their King, sent the rest into <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
as suspected, After this, <hi>Papius</hi> was so rash as to attempt to force the
Roman Camp, and was already pulling down the Palisade, when a great
Body of Horse sallying out of the Postern Gate, charged him, and slew six
thousand of his men. However, this Victory prevented not the Consul's
quitting that Post, and marching elsewhere with his Army. In <hi>Povilla</hi> the
Canusians together with the Venusians and several other People, yielded to
<hi>Iudacilius,</hi> and those who would not submit he subdued by force, slew all
the Noble Romans, that he found, and made the Citizens and Slaves serve
in his Army. Mean while the other Consul <hi>Rutilius,</hi> together with <hi>C. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
having built two Bridges over the <hi>Liris,</hi> not far distant from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with intent to pass over their Armies, <hi>Vetius Cato,</hi> who was encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the other side with his Army directly opposite to <hi>Marius</hi> his Bridge,
to dispute their passage, laid by night an ambush in a Valley near <hi>Rutilius</hi>
his Bridge; and after having let him (heedless as he did) pass, on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fell upon him with his Ambush, who cut in pieces great numbers of the
Romans, and drove multitudes into the River. The Consul himself was
wounded in the Head, and sometime after died. But when <hi>Marius,</hi> who
was still at the lower Bridge, understood the misfortune by the number of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65196:148"/>
Bodies brought down by the Current, he presently passed with all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and forced the Enemy's Camp, which had but a slender Guard; so
that <hi>Cato</hi> was forced to stay that night on the place where he had gained the
Victory, and on the morrow to march away for want of Provisions. The
Bodies of the slain Consul and other Persons of Quality, which were no
small number, being carried to the City to give them Burial, occasioned an
universal sadness in Men's minds which was not soon shook off, so grieved
they were to behold the loss of so many Citizens. Wherefore the Senate
upon Consultation enacted, that hereafter the Bodies of all such as died in
Battel should be buried in the same place where they were slain, lest the
sight of them should daunt the Courages of others, and dishearten men from
going to the War. Of which as soon as the Enemies had advice, they made
a like Ordinance. No person succeeded <hi>Rutilius</hi> in the Consulate for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of the year, <hi>Caesar</hi> not having leisure to go to the City to hold the
Assembly: What remained of his Army was divided between <hi>C. Marius</hi>
and <hi>Q. Cepion.</hi> But <hi>Cepion</hi> suffered himself to be deceived by <hi>Q. Popedius,</hi>
who Commanded a Body of the Enemy's Forces. He came to him as a Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away,
bringing along with him as Hostages two young Slaves, clad in the
<note n="*" place="margin">Praetexta.</note> Robe worn by the Sons of Persons Free and Noble; and the better to gain
his Confidence, brought him some Bars or Pigs of Lead, covered with Gold
and Silver. After which, he perswaded him to go and charge the Enemy's
Army, whither he would conduct him, and that instantly, while there was
no one to command them. So he placed himself at the head of <hi>Cepion</hi>'s For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
and when he was come to the place where he had laid his Ambush, he
put on his Horse towards a rising Ground, as if he would discover where the
Enemies were, and from thence gave the Signal to his Men; who falling
upon <hi>Cepion</hi>'s, slew him with many others; those that escaped were
by the Senate's Order joyned with <hi>Marius.</hi> About the same time <hi>Sextus
Caesar,</hi> whose Army was composed of thirty thousand Foot and five thousand
Horse, having marched among certain difficult Streits, was unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fallen upon by <hi>Marius Egnatius;</hi> who drove him into a Valley, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him to run away in his Litter (because he was sick) towards a certain Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
passable only by one Bridge; where, after having lost the greatest
part of his Army, and the Remainder at every step throwing away their
Arms, with much difficulty he at length secured himself in <hi>Theana.</hi> He ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
again as well as he could those men he had left; and with a Recruit
sent him, took the Field to go and relieve <hi>Acerra,</hi> which <hi>Papius</hi> still besieged;
where encamping near the Besiegers, they lay a long time without eithers
daring to assault the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> For <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> he bravely repulsed the Marsians who came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
him, and gave them chase to the very Hedges of their Vineyards;
which seeing they had clambered over with much difficulty, he would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
them no farther. But <hi>Sylla,</hi> who was encamped on the other side the
Vineyards, encountring the Flyers, slew likewise a great number of them.
So that that day the Marsians lost six thousand Men, besides great quantity of
Arms, which the Victors got. Yet this Victory did but the more increase
the fierceness of the Marsians. They gathered new Forces, and had the
boldness to come and offer Battel to the Romans; who, for fear of being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpowered,
kept within their Trenches: For this Nation is very Warlike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and as report goes, never lost the Day before; and indeed to this very day
never any triumphed in <hi>Rome</hi> over the Marsians, or without the Marsians.
On another side of the Country about Mount <hi>Falernus, Iudacilius, T. Afra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nius</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65196:148"/>
and <hi>P. Ventidius,</hi> with all their Forces joyned together, engaged the
Army of <hi>Cn. Pompey;</hi> routed him, and pursued him to the very Gates of
<hi>Firmo,</hi> where he shut himself up: And leaving <hi>Afranius</hi> to besiege the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the other two went each a several way about other Affairs. <hi>Pompey</hi>
presently gave new Arms to such as were preserved from the Defeat, but
he durst not adventure a Shock till such time as a fresh Army being come to
him, he caused <hi>Sulpitius</hi> to take a Compass by unfrequented ways, and gain
the Backs of the Enemy; giving him Orders to fall on in the Rear, whilst
he charged them in Front. They fought so well on both sides, that the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
remained a long time in equal Ballance; but when the Enemies saw
their Camp burning, which <hi>Sulpitius</hi> had set on fire, and that <hi>Afranius</hi> was
slain upon the place, their hearts failed them, and they fled away in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order;
and as many as could, escaped to <hi>Ascoly. Pompey</hi> forthwith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
the Town; which <hi>Iudacilius,</hi> who was a Native of it (fearing for
his Country) strove to succour with eight Cohorts. He gave advice hereof
to the Besieged, with Orders to make a Sally upon the Besiegers so soon as
they should discover him coming at a distance, that the Enemy might not
know on which side to defend themselves: But the Inhabitants were so
cowardly, that they never stirred foot; which yet hindred not <hi>Iudacilius</hi>
from forcing a Passage through his Enemies, and with as many as could fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him entring the place, where he reproached them with their Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
and Disobedience. After which, despairing of the safety of his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Citizens,
he caused all his Enemies to be slain, as well out of former
hate as because of the fault lately committed in despising his Orders, and
giving by their Example occasion to others to do the like. Then he caused
a Pile to be raised in the Temple; upon which setting up a Bed, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been very merry at a Feast, to which he invited his Friends, he took a
draught of Poyson; and laying himself upon the Bed, desired them to se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
fire to the Pile, and so died, that he might not survive his Country. Mean
while the time of <hi>Sex. Caesar</hi>'s Consulate was expired, but the Senate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
his Command for the year following, with the Authority of Consul.
As soon as he had his new Commission, he fell upon twenty thousand of his
Enemies as they discamped; killed eight thousand upon the place, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
off the Field an infinite number of Bucklers which the rest that fled had
left. But his Sickness having forced him to stay some time about <hi>Ascoly,</hi> at
length carried him off; and according to his desire, <hi>C. Bebius</hi> succeeded in
his Charge. Whilst these things passed on the Coast of the Ionian Sea, on the
other side the Hetrurians and the Umbrians with some of their Neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
People, drawn on by the Example of others, inclined to a Revolt. It
was soon known at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the advice of it put them in new fears:
Wherefore the Senate, apprehensive of seeing themselves encompassed by
Enemies on all sides, caused the Coasts between <hi>Cuma</hi> and the City to be
guarded by new Forces, in which for want of men, they entertained the
Freed Men, a thing never before done; and granted to those Allies who had
continued faithful the Freedom of their City, which was the only thing in
the World they desired. This Decree being published by all the People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Hetruria,</hi> was received with general satisfaction. By this Act of
Grace they engaged more firmly the true Friends of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi>
setled in their duty such as were wavering, and made the Enemy more mild,
in hopes of the same favour. They distributed not these new Citizens into
the Tribes, which were already five and thirty, for fear they should out-number
the old ones; but they formed new Tribes, wherein they were put
by Decuries; so that they gave last of all their Voices, which were often
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65196:149"/>
superfluous, because the five and thirty Ancient were more than half the
number of the Tribes. This design was not at first observed; or perhaps
the Allies contenting themselves at present herewith, demanded no more.
Notwithstanding, being afterwards considered, it gave fresh occasion to Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults.
The people above the Coasts of the Ionian Sea, who yet knew not
that the <hi>Hetrurians</hi> had changed their minds, had sent fifteen thousand Men
to their Assistance, whom they had ordered to march through all the by
ways imaginable. <hi>Cn. Pompey,</hi> lately made Consul, surprized them, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
about five thousand of them, and the rest dispersed, endeavouring to
recover their Countries through rough and craggy ways, and in all the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gors
of a sharp Winter; having nothing but Acorns to eat, perished almost
all with Cold and Hunger. During the same Winter <hi>Portius Cato,</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league
to <hi>Pompey,</hi> going to War upon the Marsians, was slain. After
which <hi>L. Cluentius,</hi> to brave <hi>Sylla,</hi> who lay encamped on the Pompeian
Hills, went and encamped within three Furlongs of him: And <hi>Sylla,</hi> not
able to brook the affront, without staying for those that were gone to Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
went out and charged him; but he was beaten and forced to retreat.
The Foragers being returned, he once more fell on, put <hi>Cluentius</hi> hard to
it, and forced him to remove his Camp further off; whither there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him a Recruit of <hi>Gauls,</hi> he returned once more to try the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of the Field. As the two Armies were drawn up; a <hi>Gaul</hi> of very large
Stature advanced, and dared any Roman to a single Combat; but he being
slain by a very small Numidian, struck all the rest of the Gauls into such a
Panick, that they turned their backs; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd by the disorder of their Flight,
caused all the rest of <hi>Cluentius</hi> Army to do the like, and fly by the way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Nola. Sylla</hi> pursued them so eagerly, that he slew thirty thousand of
them by the way; and because they would not open more than one of the
Gates of <hi>Nola,</hi> to let them in, the Inhabitants fearing lest the Enemy should
press in with them, there were twenty thousand more slain under the Walls;
among whom was <hi>Cluentius,</hi> performing to the last all the Offices of a brave
and gallant Leader. The General going, marched against the Hirtians,
and began to besiege<note n="*" place="margin">Boiona.</note> 
                  <hi>Equilania.</hi> Whereupon, the Inhabitants expecting the
Assistance of the <hi>Lucanians,</hi> who were to come the same day, demanded
time to consider about their Surrendry. He who knew their Cunning, gave
them an hours time; during which he caused to be brought great quantity
of Bavins of Vine-twigs to the Foot of the Wall, which was only of Beams
of Timber; and the hour being past, set fire to them. So they surrendring
only for fear, he gave the Plunder of the Town to the Soldiers as if it had
been taken by Storm; which Example made other Cities of the Hirpins wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
submit themselves to the Romans. Those being yielded, he carried
the War to the<note n="*" place="margin">Abruzzo.</note> Samnites; not by those Avenues which were guarded by
<hi>Mutilus</hi> their Chief, but by fetching a Compass through Ways by which
they never thought an Enemy could come. So that falling in among them,
at unawares, he slew great numbers, the rest flying every way they best
could; and <hi>Mutilus</hi> himself being wounded, escaping with very few into
<hi>Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ja.</note> 
                  <hi>Boviana,</hi>
where was held an Assembly of the Rebel People; where because there
were three Forts, whilst the Inhabitants thought only of defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from him, he caused some Cohorts to march about, with Order to
strom each of these Forts on the other side, and signifie to him by the smoak
when they were Masters of them: Which succeeding happily, he approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Walls; and after three hours Assault, took the Town. This was
what past under <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Conduct during this War; after which he went to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65196:149"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> to demand the Consulate. As for <hi>Cn. Pompey,</hi> he reduced the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,
the Marcinians and the Vestins. On the other side <hi>C. Cosconius,</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
burnt<note n="*" place="margin">Salpe.</note> 
                  <hi>Salapia</hi> after having taken it by force, reduced <hi>Cannes</hi> under
the Obedience of the Romans; and having besieged<note n="*" place="margin">Canosa.</note> 
                  <hi>Canusa,</hi> which the Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites
came to relieve, after a stout and rugged Fight; with great loss of men
on both sides, he was repulsed, and forced to retire into <hi>Cuma:</hi> But he soon
got a Revenge; for as the Army of the Samnites lay only parted from the
Roman by a River, <hi>Trebatius</hi> their General sent to <hi>Cosconius,</hi> that he should
either pass the River, and he would retire; or that he should retire, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
would pass the River, that they might come to a Battel. <hi>Cosconius</hi>
chose rather to retire; and as soon as <hi>Trebatius</hi> was passed, defeated him;
pursuing his routed Men to the River side, where most of them were
drowned: So that the Enemy lost fifteen thousand men, and the rest with
<hi>Trebatius</hi> escaped into <hi>Canusa. Cosconius</hi> after this Victory, went to spoil
the Countries of <hi>Larinate, Venusa</hi> and <hi>Pouilla;</hi> and assaulting the <hi>Pediculi,</hi>
in two days became Master of all the Nation, who came and submitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
His Successor <hi>Cecilius Metellus,</hi> to whom he delivered up the Army,
defeated those of <hi>Pouilla</hi> in a Battel, where <hi>Popedius,</hi> one of the Authors of
the Rebellion, being killed, the Remainder of his Forces came by Bands to
submit to the Conqueror. Thus the War of the Allies continued with much
heat until in the end all <hi>Italy</hi> obtained the Right of free Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi>
save only the Lucanians and the Samnites; who notwithstanding, soon after
were admitted as well as the rest, and distributed by Tribes, as we have said
before, for fear they should have more Votes than the ancient Citizens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indeed more numerous.</p>
               <p>About the same time there arose another Tumult in the City about Debts,
for some exacted the Interest of money lent with more rigor than was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the ancient Laws. For it seems the Romans, as well as the Greeks,
abhorred Usury as a Trade ruinous to the Poor, and an occasion of Law-Suits
and Enmities. The Persians themselves had no better opinion of it;
and made the difference but very small between the practice of it, and
cheating and lying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Notwithstanding, because Usury was now permitted
by a Custom introduced some years past, the Creditors had some Right to
demand it, but the Debtors delayed Payment under pretence of Wars and
Tumults: Some there were likewise, that seeing themselves oppressed by the
Usurers, threatned to have them condemned in a Fine. <hi>Asellio</hi> the Pretor,
Judge of these matters, did all he could to compose all Differences; but not
being able to compass it, he left them to the Law, after having explained to
the other Judges, as in a difficult matter, what was Right, and what was
Custom. Whereupon the Usurers, who could not endure mention should
be made of the old Laws; got rid of the Pretor in this manner: One day, as
he sacrificed in the Temple of <hi>Castor,</hi> surrounded with a great Croud of
people, as is ordinary, some one having thrown a Stone at him he set down
the Cup, and began to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly towards the Temple of <hi>Vesta;</hi> but being preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by others who stopt his passage, he ran into a Tavern to hide himself,
where they cut his throat. In this Confusion many who thought he had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped
into the Cloister of the <hi>Vestals,</hi> pursuing him with too much heat of
passion, ran into those places where men cannot enter without Sacrilege.
Thus was <hi>Asellio</hi> the Praetor killed in exercising his Office, clad in the holy
Habit of Cloth of Gold, worn only on solemn Festivals, about two of the
Clock, in the middle of the place, and offering a Sacrifice. The Senate cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be published by sound of Trumpet, that they would give to whoever
should discover the Authors of this Murder a Reward in Money, if a Free
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65196:150"/>
Man, his Liberty, if a Slave, and Pardon, if one of the Accomplices: Yet
they could never gain any intelligence of it; for the Usurers took a course
to stifle even the Memory of this Riot, which we may likewise reckon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Tumults of the City. It was followed by those Differences which
happened between the Chiefs of the Factions, who as in open War assailed
each other with formed Armies, each proposing no less price of his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
than his Country, of which he pretended to become Master. It was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after the War of the Allies that these Dissentions took Birth, and
thus they began.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/> After that <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and other Countries had seized
on <hi>Bythinia, Phrygia,</hi> and the neighbouring <hi>Asia,</hi> as we have said in one of
our former Books; <hi>Sylla,</hi> then Consul, obtained for his part of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the Province of <hi>Asia,</hi> with Commission for the War against <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates.</hi>
Before his departure from the City, <hi>Marius,</hi> who thought there
would be more profit than danger in this War; and besides, spurred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with a desire to Command; engaged by a World of Promises <hi>P. Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius,</hi>
Tribune of the People, to serve him in this Affair; and at the same
time put the new Citizens in hopes to raise them to an Equality with the old
ones in their Votes, and cause them to be distributed among the ancient
Tribes. By doing them this kindness, he laboured for himself; of which,
though he made no shew, yet was it only for his own ends he sought their
favour. <hi>Sulpitius</hi> presently made a Law, which if it had passed, had given
<hi>Marius</hi> the whole Authority in the Commonwealth, so much would the
New Citizens have out-voted the Old by reason of their numbers. The old
ones who perceived it, opposed it with all their might; and at last, upon
this difference they grew to so much heat, as to come to handy Strokes and
Stones. The mischiefs increasing, the Consuls fearing lest in the Assembly,
which was nigh at hand, they should come to the last Extremities, ordained
Feasts for several days like to the solemn ones, with intent to prolong the time
of the Assembly, and the danger wherewith the City was threatned: But
<hi>Sulpitius,</hi> without having regard to the Feasts, gave order to those of his
Faction to meet forthwith upon the place, with Arms under their Gowns,
to make use of upon occasion, even against the Consuls themselves: And
prepared in this manner, he began to declare against these Feasts, as unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
commanding <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Q. Pompey</hi> to revoke them at that very moment,
that the People might pass their Suffrages concerning the Laws. This dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
raised a great Tumult; Swords were drawn as before was agreed on,
and the Points presented to the Consuls, who would not yet give way to it,
till such time as <hi>Pompey</hi> luckily and nimbly getting away, <hi>Sylla</hi> withdrew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence to go and consider of it. Mean while <hi>Pompey,</hi> Son to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
and Son in Law to <hi>Sylla,</hi> for having spoken something (I know not what)
too freely, was slain by <hi>Sulpitius</hi> Faction; and <hi>Sylla</hi> returning in a small time
after, revoked the Feasts; and at the same instant went away for <hi>Capua,</hi>
where his Army lay, with design to march from thence into <hi>Asia,</hi> against
<hi>Mithridates;</hi> for as yet he knew not the Plot laid against him. The Feasts
being revoked, and <hi>Sylla</hi> gone, <hi>Sulpitius</hi> passed the Law about which so much
stir had been made; and withal, instead of <hi>Sylla,</hi> gave Commission to <hi>Marius</hi>
to make War against <hi>Mithridates. Sylla</hi> having advice hereof, resolved to
defend his Commission with Arms: And to this end draws together his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
who hoped as well as he every man to do his own business in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidition
against <hi>Mithridates;</hi> and judged if <hi>Marius</hi> went he would employ
others. After having recounted to them all the causes of Complaint he had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65196:150"/>
against <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> without explaining himself farther (for he
durst not openly declare himself in this matter) he exhorted them to be in a
readiness to receive his Commands. They who knew his design, and feared
to lose the Booty of the Asian Expedition, discover'd to him what he kept se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret;
and besought him to take courage, and lead them to the City. He
received this discourse with infinite joy, and forthwith caused six Legions to
march; whose Officers not daring to resolve to bear Arms against their
Country, drew off, to present themselves at <hi>Rome;</hi> so that there remained
not in this Army any Person of Quality but the Questor. Upon advice of
this brought to the City, Deputies were sent to meet him, to demand of
him, for what reason he came thus armed into his Country: To whom he
answered, that it was with intent to deliver it from Tyranny. He made the
same Answer to all those whom they sent one after another. Yet in the end,
he promised, that if the Senate would assemble in the Field of <hi>Mars,</hi> and
cause <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sulpitius</hi> to be there, he would come likewise, and do all
things that should be agreed on by all the World. As he drew nearer, his
Colleague <hi>Pompey</hi> came to meet him; and having applauded his Action,
promised his Assistance. As for <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> who had not had time
enough to prepare themselves, they sent other Deputies in the Senate's
name, who proposed to him not to advance nearer the City than the fifth
Stone till this Affair were more fully considered of. The Consuls, who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the Cheat, granted the Deputies what they demanded; but scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
were they gone but they followed them, and siesed on the <hi>Celimontane</hi>
Gate, and the Contiguous Wall with one Legion; <hi>Pompey</hi> commanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
siesed on the Little Hill, the third gained the Wooden Bridge, and
the fourth drew up in Battel before the Wall, whilst <hi>Sylla</hi> entred the City in
a fighting Posture. He was recieved as an Enemy, for at first they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
him with hurling of Darts out of their Windows; but when he had
threatned those in the Houses to set fire to the next Streets, they threw no
more. <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> and the rest of their Faction, having present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
armed themselves, encountred them in the place called the <hi>Esquiline;</hi>
where was fought the first Battel ever seen in the City between two Contrary
Parties; not in disorder, as formerly in their Tumults; but in open War,
with Ensigns displayed, and Trumpets sounding: For their Animosities had
urged things to these Extremities, because no person had endeavoured to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
a Remedy in the beginning. <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Party had at first the worst of it,
and began to give ground; when himself took an Ensign, and ran to carry
it into the Gross of his Enemies. Then the Soldiers, either out of respect
they bore their General, or fear of that Infamy wherewith those are brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that forsake their Colours, quitted all thoughts of Flight, and returned to
the Charge. There was brought to them likewise from the Camp another
Body of fresh Men, and another was sent about by the way of the <hi>Suburra,</hi>
to charge their Enemies in the Rear. Whereupon <hi>Marius</hi> Soldiers, who,
already tired, defended themselves but faintly against fresh Men; and who
besides, feared lest they should inclose them behind, invited those Citizens
who still fought from their Houses to come down to them, and pronounced
Liberty to such Slaves as would come to their Assistance. But when they
saw that no one stirred to help them they lost all hope, and went out of the
City, and with them all the Persons of Quality of their Party. <hi>Sylla</hi> being
gone into the <hi>Via Sacra,</hi> (or the Holy Way) where the Soldiers had the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to take something by force, he caused them to be punished in the sight
of all the people: And after having placed Courts of Guard through all the
principal places in the City, he divided with his Colleague the labour of that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65196:151"/>
night, which they spent without any sleeping, still going from Quarter to
Quarter to take care lest the Citizens should receive some injury from the
victorious Soldier.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/> Next day in the Morning they called an Assembly of the people, where
they bemoaned the deplorable estate of the Common-wealth, abandoned
for long time to the passion of Seditious People, saying, they had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to do what they had done; and that it was their advice, that for
the future nothing should be brought to the people, without having been
first debated in the Senate; and that to that purpose the ancient custom
which they had abrogated should be revived. They proposed likewise the
holding no more Assemblies for the creation of Officers by Tribes, but by
Centuries, according to the institution of <hi>Servius Tullius.</hi> That thus the
first deliberation of Affairs depending on the Senate, and being no longer
committed to the suffrage of the people, who having nothing to lose,
feared nothing, violence would give place, and good order be established,
nor would there remain any more matter for Sedition. Having by this
means and many others retrenched the authority of the Tribunes, which
was mounted even to excess, because the Body of the Senate was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
despised, by reason of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mall number of the Senators, they added
to them three hundred of the greatest and most worthy men of all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
but before all other things they cancelled as void and contrary to the
Laws all that <hi>Sulpitius</hi> had done since the Feasts ordained by the Consuls.
Thus from Tumults they came to Murders, and from Murders to Wars;
and never before did any Roman Army enter their Country to commit
acts of Hostility: but after this time all the Differences that happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their Citizens, were determined by Arms: sometimes one party be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Masters of the City, sometimes the other, which yet was no hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
that in the mean time other places were not besieged and sack'd, or
that they felt not elsewhere those calamities usually attendant upon War:
for in summ, there was no longer any Honour or Conscience, Love to the
Common-wealth or their Country, which they violated not by number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Crimes. After all this, <hi>Sulpitius</hi> Tribune of the People, <hi>Marius</hi> who
had been six times Consul, his Son, <hi>P. Cethegus, Iunius Brutus, Cn.</hi> and
<hi>Q. Granius, P. Albinovanus. M. Lectorius</hi> and other Senators, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of twelve, who were gone out of the City, accused to be the Authors
of Sedition, and to have called the Slaves to liberty, were declared Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to the Roman People, with permission to the first that met them, to
kill them unpunished, or to bring them to the Consuls; besides which they
confiscated their Goods, and sent Men into all parts to search for them,
some of which found <hi>Sulpitius,</hi> and slew him. As for <hi>Marias,</hi> he escaped
without Usher, or without so much as a Servant to <hi>Minturnum,</hi> where, as he
slept in a Room into which there came not a spark of light, the Magistrate
of the City fearing the Decree of the Roman People, whilst on the other
side he himself could not resolve to kill a man who had been six times Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul,
and done such great things, gave it in commission to a certain Gaul he
met by chance, whom he furnished with a Sword to that purpose. But
this man (as report goes) drawing near <hi>Marius</hi>'s Bed in the dark, grew
fearful, because he imagined he saw a flame dart out of his eyes; and when
he raising himself up, cryed out, <hi>Darest thou kill</hi> Caius Marius? The
Gaul astonished, fled hastily out of the Chamber, roaring with a loud voice,
that he could not kill <hi>Marius.</hi> Whereupon the Magistrate, who before
with much inward trouble had resolved upon the action, was now touched
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65196:151"/>
with a sense of Religion; besides, he remembred the presage which when
<hi>Marius</hi> was yet an Infant, promised him the seventh Consulship. For 'tis
said there fell upon his Bosom seven Eaglets, whereupon the Divines fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,
that he should seven times obtain supreme Honour. Those of <hi>Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnium</hi>
seriously weighing this, and judging what had happened to the
Gaul, came from above, forthwith led <hi>Marius</hi> out of the Town to a place
where he might be in greater safety, who knowing that <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Horsemen
sought after him, left that place, and went towards the Sea-side through
By-ways, till he found a small Cabbin, into which he entred, and laid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
down among the Leaves to repose himself a little; he had not lain there
long, but he heard a noise which made him creep closer under the leaves,
but then the noise increasing, he leaped into a Fisher-boat which lay there
by chance, out of which he put an old Fellow that was the Master of it, and
then cutting the Boat-rope which fastened it, and hoisting Sail left himself
to Fortune, he was carried to a certain Isle where he saw by accident pass
by a Ship in which he knew some of his Friends, with whom he went into
<hi>Africa,</hi> yet he could not land, being hindred by <hi>Sextus</hi> Governour of that
Province, because of his being declared Enemy; so he was forced to spend
that Winter on the Numidian Sea. The news whereof being come to
<hi>Cethegus, Granius, Albinovanus, Lectorius,</hi> and those others condemned by
the same Judgment, and who leaving the City with <hi>Marius</hi> the Son had
taken Sanctuary in the Court of <hi>Mandrestal</hi> King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued
and came to <hi>Marius,</hi> being themselves likewise jealous lest that
King should deliver them to the Enemy. They wanted neither good will
nor courage to assault their Country after <hi>Sylla</hi>'s example, but because they
had yet no Army they waited only an opportunity. Mean while, <hi>Sylla,</hi> who
was the first ever made himself Master of the City by Arms, contenting
himself with being revenged on his Enemies, without doing any violence
to the other Citizens, sent his Army before to <hi>Capua,</hi> and resumed the
charge of Consul. But the Faction of the Fugitives, and principally the
rich, with some well monied women no longer standing in fear of Arms,
desired the return of their Citizens; so that they spared neither pains nor
cost, nor the attempting the lives of the Consuls themselves; for they
thought their design would never take effect so long as they lived. As for
<hi>Sylla,</hi> he might be safe in the midst of that Army granted him by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to make War upon <hi>Mithridates,</hi> who would not forsake him, though
his Consulate were expired; but for <hi>Pompey</hi> his Colleague he was in great
danger, so the people took compassion of him, and gave him the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Italy</hi> with the Army then commanded by <hi>Cn. Pompey.</hi> This
mightily troubled <hi>Cneus,</hi> yet when <hi>Quintus</hi> was come to the Army, and on
the morrow began to exercise his Command, the other submitted to him as a
private man; but a short time after all the Soldiery being crowded about
the Consul, under pretence of hearing what he said, he was slain, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the action every one flying a several way, <hi>Cn.</hi> came in, feigning to be
mightily troubled, as at a Villany committed against all Right and Justice.
However, his anger lasted not long, but he presently resumed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of the Army. When the Consuls death was known in the City, <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
began to be fearful of himself, and after walked not the Streets without a
good company of Friends, who deserted him not by night, but not staying
long after, he departed for <hi>Capua,</hi> and thence took his march towards
<hi>Asia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, the Friends of those Banished, supported by the authority of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:65196:152"/>
                  <hi>Cinna,</hi> Successor to <hi>Sylla</hi> in the Dignity of Consul, began to let the new
Citizens know the design <hi>Marius</hi> had to mingle them among the ancient
Tribes, to the intent, that not giving their Votes last, they might have as
much power in the Common-wealth as others, which was the first cause of
<hi>Marius</hi> and the other Exiles return. The ancient Citizens opposed it all
they could, upheld by <hi>Octavius</hi> the other Consul, while <hi>Cinna</hi> stood for
the new, suspected to have been corrupted by three hundred Talents he
had received. Now those of <hi>Cinna</hi>'s Party came to the place armed with
Swords under their Gowns, where with loud cries they began to demand
their being mixed among the other Tribes, but the best part of the people
came in like manner armed about <hi>Octavius,</hi> who attended in his House,
what would be the issue of this Tumult. They brought him word, that
the greatest part of the Tribunes opposing the Demand, the new Citizens
had with Swords driven them from the<note n="*" place="margin">A place so called from the Beaks of Ships called <hi>Rostra,</hi> taken from the Enemies, and set up here.</note> 
                  <hi>Rostrum,</hi> upon report of which he
hastens by the <hi>Via Sacra,</hi> followed by a good company of men of Valour,
and like a Torrent falls in upon the Assembly, passes over the Bodies of
those that first encountred him, disperses the multitude, and after having
terrified the contrary Party, returns to the Temple of <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi>
without doing any more, for his Colleagues sake, to whom he bore respect.
But those which followed him without staying for his command, threw
themselves upon the new Citizens, and after the killing of many pursued
the rest to the City Gates. <hi>Cinna,</hi> who confident in the multitudes of the
Countrymen, had promised himself Victory when he perceived courage
had made the lesser number victorious, he ran through the City, and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Slaves to liberty; but when he saw no person joyn with him, he
went out to the Neighbouring Cities to whom the Right of Freedom had
been granted, as<note n="†" place="margin">Tivoly.</note> 
                  <hi>Tibur, Praeneste,</hi> and others as far as <hi>Nola;</hi> and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
solicited them to revolt, began to raise money to defray the Expence
of the War. Whilst he made preparation for the execution of his Designs,
<hi>C. Milonius, Q. Sertorius,</hi> and another <hi>C. Marius</hi> Senators of the same
Faction came to him. But the Senate declared <hi>Cinna,</hi> for having forsaken
the Common-wealth in imminent danger and called the Slaves to Liberty,
to have forfeited his Freedom of the City, and Dignity of Consul, and
substituted in his stead <hi>L. Merula</hi> then Priest of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> who is the only
Priest that goes continually with a Mitre; for the others wear it only when
they sacrifice. Mean while, <hi>Cinna</hi> went his way towards <hi>Capua,</hi> where
lay another Army for the Roman People, being arrived he laboured all he
could to gain the good will of the Officers and<note n="*" place="margin">Military.</note> Tribunes, and such Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
as were there, going to this purpose to the Assembly in the habit of a
private man, without Rods, and tears in his eyes, he spake to them in
this manner:</p>
               <q>
                  <floatingText xml:lang="unk">
                     <body>

                           <head>The Oration of Cinna.</head>
                           <p>YOu behold me here, (Gentlemen) despoiled of an Honour I received from
you. The People gave it me by their Votes; and yet the Senate have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
me of it, without asking the consent of the People. Though this Affront
be done to my person, I complain less of my own interest than yours: for to what
purpose now should we court the favour of the Tribes? In what can you be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to us? or to what end are your Assemblies or your Votes, since they
can cancel what you do; and you your selves so easily change your minds?</p>
                        </div>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:65196:152"/>
After having spoke thus to provoke them to anger, and made many
complaints of the misery of his condition, he rent his Robe, and leaping
from the Tribunal, threw himself upon the ground, where he lay extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a long time, till out of pure compassion they raised him up, returned
him into the Tribunal-Seat, and having restored him the Rods in Quality
of Consul, desired him to take heart, and lead them where-ever he had
occasion for their Service. He accepted their offers, and improving the
opportunity, received the Oath of Officers and Soldiers. Being in this
manner confirmed, he went through the Cities of the Allies, exciting
them as the causers of his present calamity, and for that reason drew from
each good sums of money. There were likewise many principal men of
the City, which came to joyn with him, only because it troubled them at
any time to see the Common-wealth at quiet. Whilst <hi>Cinna</hi> was thus
wholly employed in making his preparations, the Consuls <hi>Octavius</hi> and
<hi>Merula,</hi> fortified the City, raised Engines on the Walls, and levied Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
as well among those Allies continued faithful to them, as among the
Gauls; they likewise gave order to <hi>Cn. Pompey,</hi> who was with an Army
on the Ionian Sea, to come speedily to the relief of his Country, which
he forthwith did, and encamped before the Collatine Gate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cinna</hi> coming about the same time, pitched his Camp very near, and as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/>
soon as <hi>Marius</hi> had notice of it he came with the companions of his Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and landed in <hi>Etruria,</hi> whither about five hundred of his Friends
out of the City went to meet him. He appeared in a slovenly dress, his
Beard and Hair long, untrimmed and unkembed, to beget the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion:
thus went he from City to City, talking of his Fights and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
against the Cimbrians, and (which they hearkened to with more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light)
promising them to employ his utmost power and credit to procure
the passing of the Law in favour of the new Citizens. Having by these
means assembled six thousand Etrurians, he comes and joyns with <hi>Cinna,</hi>
who was joyful to have this great man his companion in the War. All
the Forces of that Faction being come up, they encamped in three
Camps on the Banks of the <hi>Tiber, Cinna</hi> and <hi>Carbo</hi> directly against the
City, <hi>Sertorius</hi> above it, and <hi>Marius</hi> to the Sea-ward: they likewise
made Bridges over the River to cut off the City from Provisions. <hi>Marius</hi>
took <hi>Ostia</hi> by storm, which he pillaged, and <hi>Cinna</hi> took <hi>Rimini,</hi> whither he
sent part of his Forces, that no relief might come to the Besieged from the
Province of <hi>Gaul.</hi> Mean while, the Consuls were extremely disquieted,
because they still stood in need of an Army; and since they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<hi>Sylla,</hi> who was already gon over into <hi>Asia,</hi> they sent to <hi>Metellus</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the Remains of the Social War against the Samnites, to put an
end to that Affair upon the best conditions he could, and come to relieve his
besieged Country; but whilst he delayed granting their Demands, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
having advice of it, prevented him, and promised them all they desired:
so the Samnites took <hi>Marius</hi>'s Party. He had likewise intelligence in the
City with <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> the Tribune, who had the command of the
Guard at the <hi>Ianicula,</hi> who in the acknowledgment of favour formerly
received from <hi>Marius,</hi> opened him one morning the Gate, and gave him
entrance into the City, whither <hi>Cinna</hi> came likewise with him, but they
were soon repulsed by <hi>Octavius</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> who came speedily in. Soon
after fell many Thunderbolts into <hi>Pompeys</hi> Camp, which slew sundry per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Quality, and among the rest the Proconsul himself. And now that
<hi>Marius</hi> had taken order that no Provision could come to the City neither by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65196:153"/>
the River nor by Sea, he assaulted the Neighbouring Cities, where lay the
Granaries of the Roman People: He took by Stratagem <hi>Antium,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Laricia.</note> 
                  <hi>Aricia,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">City of <hi>Lavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Lanuvia,</hi> and several others; and became Master of some by Treason. So
that having now likewise cut them off from Provision to the Land-ward, he
was so bold as to design going to <hi>Rome</hi> by the Appian Way, before the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
could get any Provision from elsewhere; and to this end he with <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
Carbo</hi> and <hi>Sertorius</hi> went and encamped at the<note n="*" place="margin">Abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t twelve Miles and an half.</note>
twelfth Stone from the
City. <hi>Octavius, Crassus</hi> and <hi>Metellus</hi> went and encamped right against them
on the Alban Hill, to oppose their Enterprises; and though they were the
stronger both in the Valour of their Soldiers and their Number, yet they
would not engage them, not thinking it convenient to commit the safety
of their Country to the hazard of one sole Battel. But when <hi>Cinna</hi> had sent
Cryers about the City, to proclaim that he gave liberty to all Slaves that
would come list themselves in his Service, and that they saw they went away
by whole Bands; the Senate fearing lest by too long want of Victuals the
People should grow mad, changed their mind, and sent Deputies to <hi>Cinna,</hi>
to treat of Peace. He first of all demanded if they came to him as Consul,
or as a private Person; but they finding themselves perplexed with this
Question, could answer nothing, and so returned: Soon after a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Free Persons left the City, and came and yielded to <hi>Cinna;</hi> some
for fear of Famine, and others as having no Aversion to his Party, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Occasion favourable. Wherefore now, no more fearing any thing,
he advanced with his Forces, and came and encamped within Flight-shot of
the Walls, which put <hi>Octavius</hi> Party into great perplexity: Besides, they
durst no more attempt any thing, seeing continually Run-aways and Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
going and coming from one side to the other. Mean while the Senate
knew not what to resolve on; they looked upon it as an unworthy thing to
depose <hi>Merula,</hi> whom they had made Consul in the place of <hi>Cinna;</hi> a man
who was Priest to <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and never deserved any Reproach: Yet in the
end they were constrained to send Deputies to <hi>Cinna,</hi> to treat with him for
Peace, and to Complement him in the Quality of Consul. They were not
to propose him any Conditions, but only to request him to swear he would
not slay any in the City: He would not take an Oath in those terms; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
he gave his Word, that by his good will, or by his consent, there should
not be a Person put to death in the City; and sent word to <hi>Octavius,</hi> who
was entred the City by the Gate on the other side, that he should depart,
lest something might happen to him which he could not prevent. He gave
this Answer to the Deputies, seated in the Tribunal like a Consul. But <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>
who stood up by him, kept silence; and by the sternness of his Looks
made it sufficiently appear what a Slaughter he did intend. After this Word
given, the Senate having recalled <hi>Cinna</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> (for they well perceived
this last was the Author, and that the other did but subscribe) <hi>Marius</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
in a scoffing manner, that it was not lawful for banished Men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into the City: So the Tribunes of the People immediately cancelled the
Sentence of Banishment, given against him and the rest, under the Consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
of <hi>Sylla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/> Thus they were received into <hi>Rome</hi> with a publick Consternation, and
presently they began to plunder the Goods of all such as seemed but any way
enclined to the contrary Party, without any persons forbidding them. <hi>Cinna</hi>
and <hi>Marius</hi> had upon Oath promised Security to <hi>Octavius.</hi> The Divines as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
him he need fear nothing, yet his Friends advised him to leave the City;
but he answering them that he would never forsake his Country, especially
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65196:153"/>
as long as he was Consul, retired to the <hi>Ianiculum,</hi> with the most Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of the City, and a part of the Army, mounting the Tribunal habited
like a Consul, and accompanied by Lictors with Rods and Axes. And just
when <hi>Censorinus</hi> was coming with his Horse-Men, and that his Friends yet
offered him a Horse to make his Escape on, he vouchsafed not to stir, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
his death with an admirable Constancy. <hi>Censorinus</hi> carried his head
to <hi>Cinna,</hi> who caused it to be fixed on the Tribunal for Orations; and this
was the first Consul's head that ever was fixed there. Soon after the heads
of others, who dyed in this raging fury, were likewise exposed as Spectacles
in the same place: And this horrible Custom endured long after in all Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacres
committed at <hi>Rome</hi> between the Enemy Factions. Every one of the
Victors sought out his Enemy to destroy him; no person was defended from
the cruelty of these Murtherers neither by the Dignity of Senator, nor that
of Knight; and as many Senators as they killed, they brought their heads
to the Tribunal. There was no longer any respect either towards Gods or
Men; and after having committed such dreadful Crimes, they sought to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
themselves with Spectacles yet more shameful, cutting off the heads of
the Slain, and making a show of their misfortune, whether to strike terror
into, or to give a Criminal satisfaction to the eyes of the Vulgar. Among
those that perished, the two <hi>Iulius</hi>'s, <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>Lucius; Serranus,</hi> Cousin to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius;
P. Lentulus, C. Numitorius,</hi> and <hi>M. Bebius,</hi> were found dead in the
Streets. <hi>Crassus</hi> flying, killed his Son, for fear he should fall into the hands
of those pursued him, from whom himself could not escape. <hi>M. Anthony,</hi>
the Orator, escaped to a certain Farm-House, where the Farmer gave him a
Retreat, and kept him some time concealed; but the Farmer's Servant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of this Guest, going to the Tavern for Wine oftner than he was wont;
the Vintner enquiring the reason, he privately told him; who, as soon as he
had given him his Wine, gave present advice to <hi>Marius.</hi> Upon the News
of it <hi>Marius</hi> was so transported with joy, that he would have come himself
to have been his Executioner; but his Friends disswading him, he sent a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune
with Soldiers. <hi>Anthony</hi> discoursed them with so good a Grace, and
perswaded them with so many Reasons, that he gain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d their Compassion;
till such time as the Tribune, who had stayed below, wondring at this delay,
came himself into the Chamber; and whilst he was yet talking, thrust his
Sword into his Belly; and cutting off his head, sent it to <hi>Marius. Cornutus</hi>
being hid under the Tiles, was saved by the Cunning of his Slaves; who
having found a dead Body, cast it on a Pile; and when they saw those that
came to search for him, putting fire to it, said, they burnt the Body of their
Master, who was strangled. <hi>Q. Acharius</hi> waited an opportunity till <hi>Marius</hi>
went to the Capitol to sacrifice, out of hopes that out of Religion to the
place he would grant him Pardon: But as he was coming to do his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to <hi>Marius;</hi> as soon as he perceived him, he commanded his People
forthwith to cut his Throat, and that in the very Temple; and his Head ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for a Spectacle as well as that of the Orator <hi>Anthony,</hi> and so many other
Pretorians and Consulars. Nor was it permitted to give Sepulture to their
Bodies, the conquering Party would have them exposed to be devoured by
Dogs and Fowls of the Air. The Seditious themselves did, unpunished, kill
one another at every turn. Some they drove from their House, others they
spoiled of their Goods, others deprived of their Dignities, <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Laws they
cancelled, slew his Friends; and after having pulled down his House, and
confiscated his Goods, declared him Enemy of the State. They sought like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
for his Wife and Children, to put them to death; and they escaped but
very narrowly. Thus was the City oppressed with all sort of Mischiefs and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65196:154"/>
Calamities. At length, after so many Executions of Persons without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
they thought it convenient under pretence of observing Forms
of Justice, to bring <hi>Merula,</hi> the Priest of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> to his Tryal; and to that
end suborned Accusers. He was not guilty of any Crime; but <hi>Cinna</hi> hated
him, because he had been named his Successor, though it was never his seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
At the same time they gave a Summons to <hi>Lutatius Catulus,</hi> who had
been Colleague with <hi>Marius</hi> in the Cimbrian War, and was obliged to him
for saving his life; but forgetting that good turn, had been his cruel Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutor
during his Banishment. They appointed Guards, which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
not, to watch their Motions, till the day assigned; which being come,
they were called four several times by the Usher, with the Interval of some
hours between each Call: And when they should have come to have plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Cause, Word was brought that <hi>Merula</hi> had cut his own Veins;
having writ one Tablet, which he left, that he had first laid aside the Mitre,
for it is Sacrilege for a Priest to die with the Mitre on. As for <hi>Catulus,</hi> he
had shut himself up in a close Room, newly plaistered over, and still moist;
where causing Charcoal to be kindled, he voluntarily smothered himself.
What remains concerns the Slaves called to Liberty by <hi>Cinna,</hi> and now ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the Militia; they broke open House, carrying away all they found,
and killing the first they met; and some of them were found abusing their
own Masters. He had tryed several ways to correct them; but seeing he
lost his labour, he caused them all one night, as they slept, to be encompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the Gaul Infantry, who cut them in pieces. Thus were they punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for their Perfidiousness, as they deserved. The Consuls named for the
year following were <hi>Cinna</hi> for the Second Time, and <hi>Marius</hi> for his Seventh;
so that in spite of his Banishment and Proscription, the Augury of the seven
Eaglets was accomplished. But whilst he was contriving ways to ruin <hi>Sylla,</hi>
he was carried away by a Distemper in the first Month of his seventh Consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.
<hi>Cinna</hi> caused <hi>Valerius Flaccus</hi> to be substituted in his place, whom he
sent into <hi>Asia;</hi> where he dying, he took <hi>Carbo</hi> for his Colleague.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVIII"/> Mean while <hi>Sylla</hi> hastning his Return, to be revenged upon his Enemies;
after (having in a short time vanquished <hi>Mithridates</hi> (as we have before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated)
killed one hundred and sixty thousand Men in less than three Years;
re-conquered <hi>Greece, Macedon, Ionia</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> and the other Countries
which <hi>Mithridates</hi> had siesed upon; despoiled that King of his Fleet, and
reduced him to the Kingdom of his Predecessors) he begun his Journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Italy</hi> with an Army that loved him, accustomed to Labour, and height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the happy Success of his Arms. He had likewise store of Ships
and Money; and was, in short, in a Power capable of undertaking the
greatest things; so that his Enemies began to be terrified: And for fear of
him <hi>Carbo</hi> and <hi>Cinna</hi> sent Men through all <hi>Italy,</hi> to raise Money and Soldiers,
and lay up Stores of Corn for their Service in the Depending War. They
endeavoured likewise to engage on their side all Persons of Riches and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and to gain the People, particularly the new Citizens; perswading
them they had not fallen into the present danger, but for espousing their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests.
They fitted out a Fleet, and gave Orders to guard the Coasts with
Ships they had caused to be brought from <hi>Sicily.</hi> In short, they forgot no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that could be done to make speedy Preparations for their Defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such an Allarm. As for <hi>Sylla,</hi> he wrote to the Senate a Letter full of
Anger; wherein after having made an Enumeration of all the Labours he
had undergone for the Commonwealth; in <hi>Numidia</hi> against <hi>Iugurtha,</hi> Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor;
in the <hi>Cimbrian</hi> War, Lieutenant; in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> Pretor; and in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65196:154"/>
War with the Allies, Consul; besides those great things he came from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against <hi>Mithridates:</hi> Amplifying each Action in particular, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
the great number of Provinces he had reconquered from <hi>Mithridates,</hi>
and reduced under the obedience of the Roman People: But above all, he
put a value upon the Obligation they had to him, for having been the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
of those Roman Citizens driven from the City by the violence of <hi>Cinna,</hi>
and for having comforted and assisted them in their Calamities and Distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
Adding that for a full Acknowledgment of so many good deeds his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
had proscribed and set a price upon his Head, demolished his House,
killed his Friends, and driven away his Wife and Children, who with much
difficulty escaped to him; but he should now suddainly be in the City, where
he would revenge both private and publick Injuries, and punish the Authors
of these Disorders, which notwithstanding, he did not impute to any of the
Citizens, either Ancient or New. This Letter read in the Senate struck a
terror into all the World; wherefore they sent to him Deputies to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>econcile
him with his Enemies; with Order to tell him, that if he desired any Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
the Senate would become bound for what they agreed on, provided he
would forthwith declare his Intentions. And in the mean time they forbad
<hi>Cinna</hi> from making any new Levies, until <hi>Sylla</hi> had returned an Answer.
Hereupon <hi>Cinna</hi> said, that he would put all his Concerns into the hands of
the Senate. But scarce were the Deputies gone, but he designed himself
with his Colleague Consuls for the following Year, that he might not be
obliged to return to the City to hold the Assembly. That done, they both
left <hi>Rome;</hi> and coasting all <hi>Italy,</hi> enrolled some Legions, and sent over se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Troops, one after another, to <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> with which they pretended
to go and meet <hi>Sylla.</hi> The first arrived safely at those Ports where they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
landing, but those who embarked afterwards were by Storms cast
back on the Coast of <hi>Italy:</hi> where the Soldiers coming again to their Homes,
protested that never by their good will would they bear Arms against their
Citizens: Which coming to the knowledge of others that were ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
they refused to pass into <hi>Dalmatia. Cinna</hi> enraged at this Refusal,
gave them order to come to the Assembly, thinking to oblige them to obey
by force of threats. They came thither as angry as he; not sticking to say,
that if they were too much pressed upon, they knew how to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
But as he was going away, the Lictor, who marched before to
make way for him, having pushed one of them to that purpose, a certain
Soldier returned him a Blow; whereupon, the Consul commanding the
Soldier to be arrested, a great noise suddainly arose, which was followed by
throwing of Stones; and some that stood next to <hi>Cinna</hi> drawing their
Swords, ran him through and through. <hi>Cinna</hi> thus slain in his Consulate,
<hi>Carbo</hi> caused those Troops carried over into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> to be brought back;
and so doubtful he was what to do in this Conjuncture, that he durst not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the City, though the Tribunes of the People had summoned him
to come, to the end he might in a lawful Assembly substitute another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul
in the place of him that was slain. At last however, when they threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to reduce him to the Rank of private Men, he went and appeared at the
day appointed for the Nomination of a Consul; but because the Birds gave
ill Omens of that day, he adjourned the Assembly to a farther day, on which
the Thunder falling on the Temples of <hi>Luna</hi> and <hi>Ceres,</hi> the Augurs were
the occasion that the Nomination of a Consul was deferred till after the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and that till then <hi>Carbo</hi> remained singly in that Dignity. Mean while
<hi>Sylla</hi> had returned in Answer to the Senate's Deputation, That he would
not contract Friendship with Men blackned with such horrible Crimes.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65196:155"/>
However he would not hinder the People of <hi>Rome</hi> from giving them secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
but there would be much more for those who would joyn with him,
being Master of an Army affectionate to his interests. This word alone
was sufficient to make them believe he was resolved to keep his Command,
and that he had a design to seise on the absolute Dominion; for he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
likewise that they should entirely restore his first Dignity, his Goods,
his Priesthoods: and in short, all the Honours that he had; and indeed he
had sent with the Deputies of the Senate some to demand all these things,
but when they heard at <hi>Brundusium</hi> that <hi>Cinna</hi> was dead, and the Common-wealth
in trouble, they returned to find <hi>Sylla</hi> without proceeding farther.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/> Upon this report brought to him, he left <hi>Pyraeum</hi> with five Italian Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
six thousand Horse, and the Auxiliary Forces of <hi>Macedon</hi> and <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponnesus,</hi>
which amounted to about sixty thousand Men: from <hi>Pyraeum</hi> he
came to <hi>Patras,</hi> from whence he passed over to <hi>Brundusium</hi> on a Fleet of
six hundred Ships. He was received into the Port without any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
and in acknowledgment of that seasonable kindness, he granted
to the City an exemption from all kind of Imposts for the future, which
they enjoy to this day. That done, he set forward with all his Forces, and
by the way met with <hi>Metellus Pius,</hi> who some years before had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Body of an Army in the War with the Allies; but not being
willing to return to the City, for fear of <hi>Cinna</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> was retired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<note n="*" place="margin">Genoua.</note> 
                  <hi>Liguria</hi> expecting some change. Now therefore he came to offer <hi>Sylla</hi>
what Forces he had, having still the Title of Proconsul; for when once
that Honour is attained, it lasts till he enjoys it returns to his Country.
Some time after <hi>Cn. Pompey,</hi> who afterwards gained the Title of Great,
Son of that <hi>Pompey</hi> who was killed with a Thunderbolt, came to him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
In former appearance he was no Friend to <hi>Sylla,</hi> but now he made
him lay aside all suspicion of him, by bringing with him a Legion out of
the Country of<note n="†" place="margin">Marches of <hi>Ancona.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Picene,</hi> where he was well beloved in memory of his
Father's name, he raised two other Voluntier Legions soon after; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all those that took <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Party none did him more important Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
and though yet very young, <hi>Sylla</hi> had so high a value for him, that
whoever arrived he was the only person for whom he rose up from his Seat;
that he sent him into <hi>Africa</hi> to put an end to the Remains of the War, quell
<hi>Carbo</hi>'s Party, and reestablish <hi>Hyempsal</hi> in his Kingdom, who had been
driven out by the Numidians; and that for the Actions he there did, he
granted him the Honour of Triumph, though he had not yet arrived to
the age prescribed by the Laws, and was then but a plain Knight. In so
much, that after so fair beginnings, being advanced in age as well as repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
he was sent against <hi>Sertorius</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and afterwards to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Pontus</hi> against <hi>Mithridates. Cethegus</hi> likewise came to meet <hi>Sylla,</hi>
though he had been the greatest Enemy he had, and was therefore banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>Cinna</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> but now he presented himself before <hi>Sylla</hi> in
the condition of a Suppliant, offering him to serve him in all he should be
pleased to employ him. Thus beholding himself fortified with a great
number of Soldiers and store of illustrious Friends whom he made his
Lieutenants, he placed himself at the Head of his Army with <hi>Metellus,</hi>
both being Proconsuls; for <hi>Sylla</hi> going to the War against <hi>Mithridates</hi> in
Quality of Proconsul, had not yet quitted that Dignity, though <hi>Cinna</hi> had
declared him Enemy to the State. He mortally hated those that had offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, but he kept his hatred close, for which reason those which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
in the City knowing his temper, were sorely terrified. They had
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65196:155"/>
not forgot what passed the first time he entred in Arms, they knew he was
incensed at the Sentences given against him, they saw his House pulled
down, his Goods confiscate, his Friends killed, and his Family in flight, who
very hardly escaped; and therefore thought they must resolve to overcome,
or utterly to perish, so that in this common fear they threw themselves into
the Consuls Party, and began to fetch from all parts of <hi>Italy</hi> Soldiers, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
and Money with all the diligence necessary in extreme danger. The
Consuls <hi>C. Norbanus</hi> and <hi>L. Scipio,</hi> and with them <hi>Carbo</hi> Consul the year
precedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g (who hated <hi>Sylla</hi> as much as the others, but feared him more,
out of a remorse for the injuries he had done him) after having levyed
Soldiers throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> took the Field with each his Body of an Army.
They had at first but two hundred and fifty Men in each Cohort, but soon
after they found many more; for all people had a far greater inclination for
the Consuls than for <hi>Sylla,</hi> because <hi>Sylla</hi> seemed to come against the City
like an Enemy, whilst the Consuls fought for their Country: but this was
only in appearance, for in truth they laboured only for themselves. Besides
the vulgar sensible they were sharers in the fault, were carried on to defend
it by the same fear, and no person was ignorant that <hi>Sylla</hi> had not simply
the thought of chastising, reforming, or striking terrour, but that he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated
upon Sackings, Burnings, Massacres, and in a word, the general
ruine of the City. And surely, they were not deceived: all places they
soon found sacked and filled with slaughter by the continual Fights, in which
there perished sometimes ten thousand, sometimes twenty thousand in one
only Engagement, and at once in and about the City fifty thousand, where
yet the Conquerour forgot no cruelty he could exercise on the Remainder
as well in general as particular, till in the end he reduced the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
under his Dominion, and disposed of it at pleasure. They received
from on High presages of these miseries by a great number of Prodigies,
Ghosts presented themselves to an infinite many people throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi>
as well alone as in company; they set themselves to examine ancient Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
where they still found matter of greater fear and distraction: a Mule
engendred, a Woman was delivered of a Serpent, a great Earthquake o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew
some Temples in the City. And though the Senate and People
of <hi>Rome</hi> keep constant watch against such Accidents, the Capitol built by
the Kings above four hundred years before was set on fire, none could tell
how. And indeed these were all Signs which threatened <hi>Italy</hi> with Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Desolations, and the Roman People with Servitude, and that
Change which was to happen in the Common-wealth. The beginning of
this War, accounting from the time that <hi>Sylla</hi> landed at <hi>Brundusium,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in the hundred seventy fourth Olympiad. The Actions of it were
much greater, than the time of its continuance long; for each party run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with fury to the ruine of the other, the losses they sustained were so
much the greater and more quick; yet it lasted three years, till such time
as <hi>Sylla</hi> made himself Master of the State; and even after <hi>Sylla</hi>'s death it
yet continued a long time in <hi>Spain.</hi> There was through all <hi>Italy</hi> many
Fights and Skirmishes, Sieges and other Exploits of War in great number,
and very remarkable, as well in Pitch'd Battels as in Rencounters. We
will only relate those Actions are most considerable, and best worthy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and that the most succinctly we can.</p>
               <p>The first Battel fought was about <hi>Canusa</hi> between the Consul <hi>Norbanus</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XX"/>
and the Proconsuls, wherein the Consul lost six thousand men, and those
of the other Party only seventy, but they had many wounded, and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:65196:156"/>
retreated to <hi>Capua.</hi> After which, the Proconsuls being encamped
near <hi>Theana, L. Scipio</hi> led against them another Army, more disposed to
Peace than War, which being observed by the Chiefs of the contrary Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
they sent Deputies to the Consul to treat of an Accommodation, not
that they hoped to succeed, or that they stood in need of it, but with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to sow Dissention among Troops not very fiercely set on, as indeed it
happened; for <hi>Scipio,</hi> after having received Hostages, went into the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
Fields to confer with the others, whom he found there likewise,
They were but three of a side, so that it was not known what passed in the
Conference, save only that they remained of accord, that <hi>Sertorius</hi> by the
Consul's order should go and find his Colleague to communicate with him,
and that while they staid for an answer, there should be a Cessation of Arms.
But <hi>Sertorius</hi> having seised upon <hi>Suessa</hi> that held for <hi>Sylla,</hi> and he making
complaint to <hi>Scipio,</hi> whether he had consented to it, or knew not what to
answer, surprised as he was with the unexpected news, he resigned up the
Hostagesto <hi>Sylla;</hi> whereupon the Army offended at the Action <hi>Sertorius</hi>
had so unseasonably done, and at the redelivery of the Hostages, began to
blame the Consuls, and caused <hi>Sylla</hi> to be privately informed, that if he
would draw a little nearer, they would all come over to him. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
made, the Consul found himself so forsaken, that he knew not
what to resolve, he was taken alone in his Tent by <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Men, having no
body with him out <hi>Lucius,</hi> his Son. But certainly it seems to me a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of a General not to have the foresight to perceive so great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy
of a whole Army. <hi>Sylla</hi> not being able, whatever he could plead to
them, to make the Consul or his Son take his part, dismissed them both
without any injury done; and at the same time sent other Deputies to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pua,</hi>
to treat the peace with <hi>Norbanus,</hi> whether he indeed feared, seeing
the most part of <hi>Italy</hi> took the Consuls part, or whether he laid the same
snares for him he had done for <hi>Scipio;</hi> but seeing no one came to him, nor
that any answer was returned him (for it's probable the Consul took care
not to give his Army occasion of like scandal) he took the Field to march
against <hi>Norbanus,</hi> wasting all the Country as he went; <hi>Norbanus</hi> on the
other side did the like, and <hi>Carbo</hi> went before to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and all the other Senators who were joyned to <hi>Sylla,</hi> Enemies to the
Senate and People of <hi>Rome.</hi> 'Twas at this time that the Capitol took fire,
about which ran divers reports, some accused <hi>Carbo,</hi> others suspected the
Consuls, others said <hi>Sylla</hi> had caused it to be done. But it being hard to
discover the truth of so uncertain a thing, we will leave it in its incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
For <hi>Sertorius,</hi> who sometime before had obtained the Government of
<hi>Spain,</hi> after having taken <hi>Suessa,</hi> he went into his Province, where refusal
being made him of quitting the Command, the Roman Armies had enough
to suffer. Mean while the Consuls Forces increased dayly by the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Soldiers that came from the farthest parts of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> about
the <hi>Po:</hi> and <hi>Sylla</hi> on his side did not sleep, he continually sent Messengers
to all the People of <hi>Italy</hi> to draw them to his Party, either by inclination,
or fear, or money, or by the power of promises, insomuch that the rest
of the Summer was consumed in these Affairs. In the beginning of the
next year were named for Consuls <hi>Papirius Carbo</hi> for the second time, and
<hi>Marius</hi> Son to the Brother of the illustrious <hi>Marius,</hi> of but seven and
twenty years old; and because in this Season the Colds were too great,
each Party drew into Garrisons, but as soon as the Spring was come on,
there was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wherein the Lieutenant being defeated, with a great loss of Men, the
Neighbouring Places that held for the Romans yielded to <hi>Metellus:</hi> but

and little, when he came to <hi>Sacriport</hi> he drew up in order of Battel; <hi>Sylla</hi>
having done the like, they fought bravely, till <hi>Marius</hi>'s Left Wing begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to stagger, five Cohorts and two Squadrons, who had turned their
backs of set purpose, threw down their Colours, and went all and yielded
to <hi>Sylla;</hi> which was the sole occasion of the Rout; for all the rest presently
took their flight towards <hi>Praeneste, Sylla</hi> still following them close at the
Heels. The Praenestines let the first that presented themselves enter, but
because the Enemy was so close in the Rear of them, they shut their Gates,
and drew up <hi>Marius</hi> over the Wall with Ropes; and now there was a great
Slaughter before the Walls, and many Prisoners taken, among which all
that were found to be Samnites were by <hi>Sylla</hi>'s command cut in pieces, as
obstinate Enemies of the Roman Name. About the same time <hi>Metellus</hi>
defeated another Army of <hi>Carbo</hi>'s, five Cohorts having come over to his
Party in the heat of the Fight, which much advanced the Victory. <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
likewise beat <hi>Marius</hi> about <hi>Siena,</hi> and took and sacked the City. As for
<hi>Sylla,</hi> after having shut up <hi>Marius</hi> in <hi>Praeneste,</hi> he caused the place to be
encompassed with a very large Circumvallation, which he gave in charge
to <hi>Lucretius Offella,</hi> that he might take the Consul by Famine, there being
no necessity of Fighting. He seeing his Affairs desperate, and unwilling
his Enemies should survive him, wrote to <hi>Brutus</hi> Praetor of the City, that
he should call the Senate upon any other pretence, and then cause <hi>Antistius,</hi>
the other <hi>Carbo,</hi> with <hi>Lucius Domitius</hi> and <hi>Mutius Scaevola</hi> the High Priests
to be slain. The two first according to <hi>Marius</hi>'s order were killed in the
Senate by Murderers sent thither, <hi>Domitius</hi> flying, was slain at the Door,
and <hi>Scaevola</hi> at some distance from the Palace. Their Bodies were cast into
the River; for the custom was now grown ripe, not to suffer Burial to be
given to those were slain, Mean time, <hi>Sylla</hi> drew off his Forces towards
<hi>Rome</hi> by several ways, with order to seise on the Gates, and if they were
repulsed to retire to <hi>Ostia,</hi> which way soever they marched the terrour of
their Arms made the Cities receive them, and <hi>Rome</hi> it self shut not her
Gates; for the Citizens were straitened with Famine, and already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
no more with stubborness to resist Calamities at hand. As soon
as <hi>Sylla</hi> had this intelligence he immediately advanced, and drawing up his
Army in Battalia in the Field of <hi>Mars</hi> before the Gate, entred the City,
where not finding one of the contrary Faction, he forthwith confiscated
their Goods, and publickly sold them; and assembling the people, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
that he had been forced by the malice of his Enemies to come to
these Extremities, exhorting the Citizens to take courage, with promise
they should in a few days behold the end of their miseries, and the re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment

                  <hi>Clusa,</hi> where there
was yet a Remain of War not to be neglected. Whilst he was at <hi>Rome</hi>
some Celtiberian Horse sent from the Praetors of <hi>Spain</hi> were joyned with the
Consul's Army, which occasioned a Fight betwixt the Horsemen near the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65196:157"/>
River <hi>Glanis,</hi> where <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Horsemen had the better, he killed about five
hundred of the Enemy, and two hundred and seventy Celtiberians came
over to his side; all the rest <hi>Carbo</hi> caused to be cut in pieces, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the treachery of their Countrymen, or for fear his Men should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
their example. At the very instant of this Victory, <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Party fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against their Enemies about <hi>Saturnia,</hi> defeated them; and <hi>Metellus</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by Sea to the Borders of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> reduced under his obedience the
Country of the Uritanians, which is a vast Champain very fruitful in Corn.
Another Body of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Men entring by night into <hi>Naples</hi> by treason put all
to the Sword (save a few that escaped by flight) and made themselves
Masters of all those People's Galleys. As for what passed at <hi>Clusa, Sylla</hi>
fought a whole day together against <hi>Carbo,</hi> and the Field was so resolutely
maintained, that only night parted them, Victory inclining neither to one
side nor the other. But in the Country of <hi>Spoletto Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi> both
Lieutenants to <hi>Sylla</hi> cut in pieces about three thousand of <hi>Carbo</hi>'s Men, and
kept <hi>Carinas,</hi> who commanded them, blocked up, till <hi>Carbo</hi> sent another
Army to relieve him, of whose March <hi>Sylla</hi> having intelligence, crossed their
way, and charged so briskly, that he left about two thousand in the place.
but yet <hi>Carinas</hi> taking the opportunity of a dark and rainy night, escaped
from the Besiegers hands, who though they knew it well enough, yet let him
pass because of the cruel weather. The same <hi>Carbo,</hi> to rescue his Colleague
<hi>Marius</hi> besieged in <hi>Praeneste,</hi> and ready to perish with Famine, sent <hi>Marcius</hi>
with eight Legions, whom <hi>Pompey,</hi> that lay in ambush for him, so vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
assaulted, that he slew the greatest part, and forced the rest to retreat
to a rising ground, where he invested them; but <hi>Marcius</hi> causing great
Fires to be kindled, to make the Enemy believe he still was there, marched
off closely in the dark, but his Army imputing to him the fault committed
in falling into the Ambuscade, mutinyed, and whether he would or no
took their march towards <hi>Rimini,</hi> where the greatest part disbanding
themselves, went home; so that <hi>Marius</hi> had but seven Cohorts left, with
which after all these misfortunes he went to find out <hi>Carbo.</hi> After this
<hi>M. Lamponius, Pontus Telesinus</hi> and <hi>Gutta</hi> of <hi>Capua</hi> being upon their
March with seventy thousand Men, as well Lucanians as Samnites, to go
and disengage <hi>Marius; Sylla</hi> seised of a certain Strait, by which only they
could pass to go to <hi>Praeneste,</hi> so that they were forced to return without
doing any thing. And now the Consul falling from all hopes of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
caused a Fort to be raised in a spacious place between the City and
Trenches, whither he brought Engines, and drew together all his Forces
with intention to make <hi>Lucretius</hi> retire, and open himself a passage by Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
but after divers continued endeavours for many days he shut himself
up again within the Walls of <hi>Praeneste.</hi> About the same time <hi>Carbo</hi> and
<hi>Norbanus</hi> after a long hard March perceived themselves towards Evening
to be near <hi>Metellus</hi> his Camp, and though there were but an hour more of
daylight, and that they saw all about the Vineyards lay very thick, yet
they drew up their Army in Battalia with more passion than prudence.
They thought to fright <hi>Metellus</hi> by this surprize, but both time and place
being disadvantageous to them, they fell one upon another, and were so
cruelly defeated, that they left six thousand upon the place, six thousand
yielded to <hi>Metellus,</hi> and the rest fled every man his way, so that a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
only retreated in order to <hi>Arezzo.</hi> Upon the news of this defeat a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of Lucanians commanded by <hi>Albinovanus,</hi> joyned with <hi>Metellus</hi>'s
Party, and that in despite, as it were, of their General, who yet not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
courage, went to find out <hi>Norbanus;</hi> and yet after all this, having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65196:157"/>
treated with <hi>Sylla,</hi> upon condition to do some memorable service,
he invited <hi>Norbanus</hi> to a Treat with his Lieutenants <hi>C. Apustius</hi> and <hi>Flavius
Fimbria</hi> Brother to that <hi>Fimbria</hi> who killed himself in <hi>Asia,</hi> together with
all the Officers of <hi>Carbo</hi>'s Party, who being all met save only <hi>Norbanus,</hi> he
caused them to be slain in the midst of the Feast, and yielded himself to
<hi>Sylla.</hi> After this Treachery <hi>Norbanus</hi> hearing that <hi>Rimini</hi> because of this
accident, and of some Armies that lay nigh to it had likewise fallen off to
<hi>Sylla</hi>'s Party, and believing (as it generally happens to all men in declining
fortune) that he could no longer confide in the friendship of any man, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued
on a Vessel belonging to a private man, and got safe to <hi>Rhodes,</hi>
whither <hi>Sylla</hi> having sent to demand him, whilst the Rhodians were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
about it he slew himself in the midst of the place: <hi>Carbo</hi> yet sent
two Legions under the command of <hi>Damasippus</hi> to <hi>Praeneste,</hi> to raise that
Siege with all speed possible, but they could no more than the others force
<hi>Sylla</hi>'s Men posted in the Strait. Beside all this, all the Cisalpine Gauls
yielded to <hi>Metellus;</hi> and <hi>Lucullus</hi> encountring another Army of <hi>Carbo</hi>'s
near <hi>Placentia,</hi> gained the Victory; so that this General after so many
losses, though he had still thirty thousand Men about <hi>Clusa,</hi> the two Legions
with <hi>Damasippus,</hi> and two others commanded by <hi>Carinas</hi> and <hi>Marcius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
a great number of Samnites continually engaging with <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Men to
drive them from the Strait where they were posted, lost all hopes, and fled
to <hi>Africa</hi> with his Friends, in which he certainly committed a great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to leave <hi>Italy</hi> being Consul, as if after having lost it, he could make
himself Master of <hi>Africa.</hi> The Army which he left at <hi>Clusa</hi> engaging
with <hi>Pompey,</hi> after the loss of twenty thousand Men, dispersed, and every
man returned home. As for <hi>Carinas, Marcius</hi> and <hi>Damasippus</hi> having joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Forces they marched towards the Strait of which we have so often spoke,
hoping with the assistance of the Samnites to come to a good issue, but not
succeeding better than others before them, they advanced towards <hi>Rome,</hi>
which they thought might easily be taken, wanting both Men and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and went and pitched their Camp upon the Alban Hill at the<note n="*" place="margin">Ten Miles off.</note> tenth
Stone. But now <hi>Sylla,</hi> who was afraid for the City, caused the Vanguard
of his Horse to advance first to retard the Enemies March, and himself
following with the rest of his Forces by great journies arrived about noon at
the Colline Gate, and went and encamped near the Temple of <hi>Venus.</hi> The
Enemies were likewise encamped on the Skirts of the City, so that though
the Sun were declining, the two Armies came to a Pitched Battel, <hi>Sylla</hi>'s
Right Wing had the better of it, but his Left Wing being over-born, fled
towards the Gates, where the old men that were upon the Walls seeing
that the Conquerors and Conquered ran pell-mell together, let fall the
Portcullis, which by it's fall crushed in pieces many Soldiers, and likewise
some Senators. Then the greater Party forced through fear and necessity
turned head upon the Enemies, and having continued the Fight all night
cut in pieces a great number, among whom were found <hi>Tel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sinus</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus.</hi>
Their Camp was taken, and <hi>Lamponius, Lucanius, Marcius, Cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>
and all those Officers of <hi>Carbo</hi>'s side that escaped took their flight seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ways. The number of the dead on both sides was adjudged to amount
to fifty thousand, and that of the Prisoners more than eight thousand: of
which the greatest part being Samnites, <hi>Sylla</hi> caused them all to be slain by
his Bowmen. On the morrow, <hi>Marcius</hi> and <hi>Carinas</hi> being taken in their
flight, <hi>Sylla</hi> pardoned them not, though his Fellow Citizens, but causing
their Heads to be cut off, sent them to <hi>Lucretius</hi> to be carried about the
Walls of <hi>Praeneste.</hi> When the Besieged saw them, and understood that all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65196:158"/>
                  <hi>Carbo</hi>'s Forces were lost, that <hi>Norbanus</hi> was fled from <hi>Italy;</hi> and in a
word, that the City it self was in <hi>Sylla</hi>'s power, they yielded up the place.
<hi>Marius</hi> run into a Mine to hide, but there soon after slew himself. His
Head was carried to <hi>Sylla,</hi> who set it up before the Tribunal for Orations,
with some Railleries about the Consuls Age, who ought to have exercised
himself at the Oar before he took the Helm. <hi>Lucretius</hi> become Master of
<hi>Praeneste,</hi> found there many Senators; some of which he caused to be slain,
others he put in Prison, till <hi>Sylla</hi> coming upon the place, put them likewise
to death: For the Soldiers, he caused them to march into the Field unarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and after having picked out some that had served him, he divided the
others into three Bands; the Romans were set in one place, the Samnites
in another, and the Praenestines in a third: Then he caused the Romans to
be told by Cryers, that they had deserved death, but however he pardoned
them; the rest were all slain, only the Women and Children were saved;
and the City, which was one of the richest of those times, was plundered.
<hi>Praeneste</hi> being treated in this manner, yet the City of <hi>Norba</hi> held out stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
till such time as <hi>Emilius Lepidus</hi> getting in one night by Treason, the
Inhabitants mad with rage and despight, found a way to die; some by
their own Swords, others mutually killed each other, others died by
strangling, and some, after having shut fast the Doors of their houses, set
fire to them; which inflamed by a suddain Wind, at once devoured them
and all that should have been the Soldiers Prey. The taking of <hi>Norba</hi> put
an end to this War, which had been the occasion of so many miseries to
both sides, and by Fire and Sword to all <hi>Italy.</hi> And now, the better to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Victorious Party, <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Lieutenants went through all the Towns,
and placed Garrisons in such as were suspected; and <hi>Pompey</hi> had Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to go and pursue the Remainder of the War in <hi>Africa</hi> against <hi>Carbo,</hi>
and in <hi>Sicily</hi> against those still held his Party.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXII"/>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> now become Master of <hi>Rome,</hi> called an Assembly of the People;
where having spoken haughtily of his Actions, and said a great many things
to strike terror into the People, he concluded his Discourse with saying he
would make the people's condition better than it was, so they would obey
him, but he would pardon none of his Enemies; on the contrary, there
should be no Punishment nor Calamity which he would not make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo:
And since <hi>Scipio</hi> had broke his Word with him, would likewise do all
he could to destroy those had favoured the contrary Party, without sparing
Pretors, Quaestors or Tribunes. The Assembly was scarce broke up, but he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
forty Senators and sixteen hundred Knights; for it is said that he was
the first Inventor of the Proscription of Heads, and the first that proposed
Rewards to Murderers and Discoverers of those Unfortunate Wretches
that hid themselves, and decreed Penalties against those who discovered
them not. Some time after he added likewise other Senators to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Proscribed; some of which were slain before they heard any
thing of it, in whatsoever place they were found; in the Streets, in their
Houses, in the Temples. They hanged several whom they came and threw
dead at <hi>Sylla</hi>'s feet; they dragged along others, set their feet upon their
Throats, whilst at all these horrible Spectacles no one durst say a word.
Some they drove from the City, despoiled others of their Goods: And
those sent into the Country to search for them that fled, ran up and down
every where, searched in every hole, and murdered as many as they could
find. The Allies who had obeyed the Orders of <hi>Carbo, Norbanus</hi> or <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
or their Lieutenants, fared no better; all places were filled with Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65196:158"/>
Plundring and Banishment. Throughout all <hi>Italy</hi> they set themselves
to inform of these things, as of greate crimes, to be severely punished,
who had born Arms, commanded Troops, furnished Money, or done any
Service against <hi>Sylla,</hi> though it were but giving Counsel to his Enemies; so
that Men accused their Hosts, their Friends, their Creditors and their
Debtors. Some were made criminal for only having given some relief to
those of the contrary Faction, and some for but travelling upon the Road
with them. But above all, the rich Men were in greatest danger. After
the Accusations against particular Persons were over, <hi>Sylla</hi> undertook to
punish whole Bodies of People, which he did in divers manners; he demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
the Forts and rased the Walls of some, layed great Fines upon others,
tormented others with cruel Exactions, transplanted others to another
Country, that he might give their Lands to his Soldiers who had served him
in the War; to the end, that they being planted in the most commodious
places of <hi>Italy,</hi> might reduce all people under his Obedience; which fixed
the Soldiery to his Interest for the whole Course of their life: For they knew
they could not maintain themselves in those Inheritances, unless all that <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
had done stood good; and therefore were always ready to maintain his
Authority, even after his death. Whilst these things passed in <hi>Italy, Carbo,</hi>
who had escaped out of <hi>Africa</hi> into <hi>Sicily,</hi> with many Persons of Quality,
was taken flying from thence to <hi>Corcyra</hi> by people sent after him by <hi>Pompey,</hi>
with Orders to kill all the rest, without permitting them to see him; but for
<hi>Carbo,</hi> though he had been three times Consul, he suffered him to lie bound at
his feet; where, after he had said a thousand cruel things, he caused him to
be put to death, and sent his head to <hi>Sylla.</hi> After he had thus treated his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to his hearts content, so that there remained none of the contrary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
but <hi>Sertorius,</hi> and he a great way off, he sent <hi>Metellus</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, and began to dispose of the Affairs of the City at his pleasure.
There being now no regard to the Laws, or Votes, or any of the ancient
Formalities; all people hiding themselves for fear, or at least holding their
peace, the People and Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> ratifyed all that <hi>Sylla</hi> had done, as
well in his Charge of Consul as in the Quality of Pro-Consul; and caused
to be erected for him in the place for Orations a guilt Statue on Horse-back,
with this Inscription.</p>
               <q>To CORNELIUS SYLLA, Emperor
the Happy.</q>
               <p>For his Flatterers called him happy, because of the continual Success of his
Arms against his Enemies; and it was only Flattery gave him that Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name.
I my self found in certain Memoirs, that in the same Sessions of the
Senate, they gave him the Title of THE GRACIOUS; which I the
easier believe because himself afterwards took the name of FOELIX, not
much different in signification from that of GRACIOUS. There was
likewise found an Oracle which confirmed him in the Resolution of underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
all these things; and ran thus,
<q>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:65196:159"/>
                     <l>Believe, brave Roman, <hi>Venus</hi> guides thy Fate,</l>

                     <l>By mighty Actions then advance thy State,</l>
                     <l>Sure of Assistance from the Powers Divine.</l>
                     <l>But let not Gods their Favours cast away;</l>
                     <l>Delphian <hi>Apollo</hi> waits for Gifts of thine.</l>
                     <l>And when War brings thee to Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> pay</l>
                     <l>A Golden Axe to <hi>Carian, Venus</hi> Shrine.</l>

               </p>
               <p>However it were or whoever it was that wrote either of these two Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites
on his Statue, in my Opinion good Raillery might be made of either.
But they stopped not here to gain the good Grace of the Conqueror; they
sent to that place an Axe with a Crown of Gold, and put on it this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.
<q>
                     <l>Great <hi>Venus,</hi> let this Gift Acceptance meet,</l>
                     <l>Which <hi>Sylla,</hi> head of <hi>Rome,</hi> lays at thy Feet,</l>
                     <l>Dreaming he saw thee ready for the Fight:</l>
                     <l>Provoke his Soldiers to maintain his Right.</l>
                  </q>
Being then in Effect King or Tyrant, since he mounted not to this Supreme
Power by the consent of the People, or the Authority of the Senate, but
by force; yet standing in need of some pretence, that he might seem lawfully
elected, he made use of this Artifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIII"/> Formerly in <hi>Rome</hi> the most vertuous were Kings; and when any King di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Senators by turns from five days to five days presided over the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Commonwealth, till such time as another, elected by the
Votes of the people, succeeded in the Kingdom; and this Five Days-Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
was called <hi>Inter-rex.</hi> Afterwards when the Republick was governed
by Consuls, instead of Kings; only those Consuls going out of Office, had
Right to call an Assembly for the naming new; and if by any Accident they
happened to be wanting, they created an <hi>Inter-rex</hi> to preside in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
According to this custom <hi>Sylla</hi> took the occasion now there were no
Consuls in the Commonwealth, <hi>Carbo</hi> being cut off in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi>
in <hi>Praeneste;</hi> and retiring for some time out of the City, sent word to the
Senate, they should create an <hi>Inter-rex.</hi> The Senate having received his
Orders, gave that Dignity to <hi>Valerius Flaccus;</hi> hoping that by this means
they should soon have an Assembly for the Election of new Consuls. But
<hi>Sylla</hi> writ to <hi>Flaccus,</hi> to acquaint the Senate from him, that the present E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of Affairs required they should name a Dictator; not for a certain time,
as the ancient Custom which had lasted four hundred years required; but
till the Affairs of the City, of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of the whole Empire, which till
now had been shaken with continual Wars, were settled and put in better
order. There is no doubt this new Proposition meant only himself, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he was not shy in shewing the desired it; for in the end of the Letter he
wrote, that if the Fathers thought good, he offered himself to render that
Service to the Commonwealth. When this Letter was read in the City,
the Senate and people of <hi>Rome</hi> were grievously perplexed: They saw now
they must no more hope for a lawful Assembly, and that they were no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Masters; wherefore under the Mask of an Assembly, they willingly
accepted of this false Appearance of Liberty granted them, and created
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65196:159"/>
                  <hi>Sylla</hi> Tyrant, with an absolute Power for as long time as he pleased; for
formerly the Dictatorship was a bounded Tyranny, for a certain time of
short continuance: But having taken away these Bounds, there wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to make it an accomplished Tyranny. Yet they gave him a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
name; saying, that he was created Dictator to make such Laws as he
should judge profitable to the Commonwealth, and to apply necessary Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
Thus the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had been under the Dominion of
Kings about a hundred <hi>Olympiads;</hi> and almost as long under Popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
where Consuls presided, and changed every Year; returned
under a Form of Royalty in the Seventy fifth <hi>Olympiad</hi> of the Greeks:
there was now no fighting at the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games, nor any other Exercise
but running: For <hi>Sylla,</hi> after the War with <hi>Mithridates</hi> was ended, and
the Intestine Disorders appeased, sent for all the Combatants, and whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
else could give any pleasure to the City, under pretence to recreate the
people, wearied with so many Toyls. And that he might not seem to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach
upon the ancient form of Government, he permitted the People to
chuse Consuls. They gave that Dignity to <hi>M. Tullius</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Dolobel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
but he, in Quality of Dictator, reigned absolutely, even over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
themselves; for they carried before him four and twenty Axes, as they
did before the other Dictators, and as formerly before the Kings; and he
always went encompassed with Guards: Besides, he cancelled Laws, and
made new ones. Among others he made one, by which he enacted, that
none for the future should receive the Office of Praetor till he had been
Quaestor, nor be Consul till he had been Praetor, nor obtain one Dignity
twice until ten years after he had exercised it. As for the Tribuneship, he
so en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eebled it, that it seemed quite under foot; making a Law, by which
it was enacted, that after being Tribune, no Man should be admitted to any
other Dignity; so that no Person either of Quality, or desirous of Honour,
would accept that Charge. Yet it is not positively certain whether it was
he that transferred it from the People's Choice to the Senate's, as it is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
However it were, seeing the Senators reduced to a small number by
reason of the Tumults and Wars, he added three hundred, whom he took
from the principal Cavaliers; yet not till having first demanded the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage
of the Assembly for each of them. He augmented likewise the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the People with all the Slaves of the Proscripts, whom he found well
made, and in the Flower of their Age, to the number of ten thousand; first
giving them their Liberty, then the Right of Freedom, with the name of
Cornelians, as their Benefactor. Thus he had always ten thousand Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
ready at the first beck. And to make himself Creatures throughout all
<hi>Italy,</hi> he divided, as hath been said, among twenty three Legions great
Parcels of Land, part Publick, and part confiscated from the Cities who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
the contrary Party. But he was so terrible hasty and cholerick upon
the least occasion, that he caused <hi>Lucretius Offella,</hi> who took <hi>Praeneste,</hi> and
gave the last stroke to the War, to be slain in the midst of the place, because
being only of the Order of Knights, and having never past the Degrees of
Quaestor or Praetor, against the new Law, he stood for the Consulate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Dictator's mind, and in despight of those warnings he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him to desist the pursuit of it; grounding himself upon this, that he
had served him well in his War. After this Action, he thus spoke in full
Assembly.</p>

they had granted Ports and Lands, were not exempt. We have elsewhere

Now this <hi>Alexander</hi> flying for Refuge to <hi>Sylla,</hi> and gaining his

out of hope to draw good store of Money out of so rich a Kingdom. But

himself voluntarily from his Dictatorship, without any Man's propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it to him: Which certainly appears to me a thing worthy of all Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
that this man, the most powerful of the Age he lived in, should of
his own accord quit so great an Empire; not to his Son, as <hi>Ptolemy</hi> in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
Ariobarzanes</hi> in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> and <hi>Seleucus</hi> in <hi>Syria;</hi> but in favour of
those over whom he had exercised an insupportoble Tyranny, and indeed
it seems quite contrary to Reason; for why so much Toyl and Labour?
Why expose himself to so many dangers, to raise him to this high Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
Only to lay it down by his own Free Will. And I wonder no less at
this; that <hi>Rome</hi> being still peopled, after having lost more than a hundred
thousand Men in this War, of whom ninety were Senators of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
faction, fifteen Consulars, two thousand six hundred Knights, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
those banished of that Order, whose Goods had been confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and many of their Bodies left without Burial. <hi>Sylla,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
finding himself in Security both at home and abroad; without fearing
those whose Forts he had demolished, whose Walls he had thrown down,
whose Goods he had pillaged, whose Immunities he had deprived them
of, returns of himself to the Condition of a Private Man, such was his Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or his good Fortune. It is said, that when he deposed himself from
his Dictatorship, in the middle of the place he cryed aloud, that he was
ready to render an Account of his Actions to any one that demanded it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and at the same time sending away his Lictors with their Axes, dismissed
his Guards, and walked yet a long time with some few of his friends only,
before all the Multitude, astonished at this Change as at a prodigy. In
the Evening he returned to his house, none presenting themselves to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
against him; save one young Fellow, who not being hindred by any,
had the Impudence to revile him with words: And he who had poured
out his Anger against so great men, and against whole Cities, suffered
with patience the reproaches of this Correction, by saying as he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his house, either by natural Foresight or Inspiration from above; <hi>This
Boy will be the occasion, that if any after me obtains the like Dignity, they will
never lay it down.</hi> The Event of which Prediction soon after happened:
For <hi>Caesar</hi> mounted to a like Estate, would not descend. <hi>Sylla</hi> then immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
(at least in my Opinion) in all he desired, being by the favour
of Fortune, from a private man become a Monarch; would from a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
become a private man, and spend the rest of his life in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
So retiring to an Estate near <hi>Cuma,</hi> he divertized himself with Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Hunting, not that he was weary of a private life in the City, or
need be troubled for want of Armies to Command, if he had a desire to
undertake any thing, for he was yet young and vigorous, and had
throughout all <hi>Italy</hi> about Sixscore Thousand Men bred up in Fighting
under his Banners, and who possessed Lands and great Estates by his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality;
besides the Ten Thousand <hi>Cornelians</hi> of the City fixed to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
with those of his Faction who all together hated and feared by
the contrary Party, and could no way hope to avoid the revenge of those
mischiefs they had done to others, but by his preservation. But I believe
that finding himself glutted with Wars, and Dominion, and City Affairs,
he began to love a Country life. After that he had laid down the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Power, the people seeing themselves delivered from Tyranny, and
from the fear wherein they lived, suffered themselves by little and little to
be carried on to new seditious, matter to which was furnished by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls
themselves, <hi>Catulus</hi> one of them was of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s faction, and his Colleague
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65196:161"/>
                  <hi>Emilius Lepidus</hi> on the contrary party, they mortally hated each other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
and from the beginning of their Consulate, so little concord was perceived
between them then, that no man doubted but their division would cause
new miseries in the Common-wealth. Mean while <hi>Sylla</hi> retired in his soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
dream'd one night that Destiny called him; wherefore as soon as it
was light he rose, and after having told his Friends his Dream, that day
made his Will, which was no sooner sealed, but the Fever seised him, so
that the night following was the last of his life. His death immediately
gave occasion of new troubles; for one side were of opinion, that his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
should be carried in Funeral Pomp through <hi>Italy,</hi> and so being brought
to the City, they should give him Burial in the place at the publick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence:
which <hi>Lepidus</hi> and those of his Faction opposed: however <hi>Catulus</hi>
and <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Party carried it. So his Body was brought through <hi>Italy</hi> upon a
Litter all covered with Gold, and adorned with Royal Ornaments, before
which marched at the sound of a great many Trumpets Men carrying
Axes and other Ensigns of the Dictatorship: the Light Horse, and Men
at Arms armed Cap-a-pee followed next all about the Litter, which was
followed by his Lieutenants and Tribunes in Arms, all following each other
in their Order and Degree to honour his Funerals. The People likewise
ran in from all parts in such vast numbers, that never were such crowds
seen; but when the Corps entred the City, the Pomp augmented much,
before were carried above two thousand Crowns of Gold, which the Cities
and Legions which he had commanded, and his own particular Friends had
caused to be made to present him with: besides there were many other
Magnificencies not to be expressed; and because there was some reason to
fear for the great concourse of Soldiery which were in the City, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
were used to bring things in order. The Corps then being conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Priests and Vestals, each in their degree, after them marched
all the Senate with the Officers, adorned with marks of their Dignity, next
a Troop of Roman Knights, and at last a multitude of Soldiers that had
served under him; for upon the report of his death they made all the haste
they could to come to his Funerals, with gilt Ensigns and Bucklers inlaid
with Silver, as the fashion is at this day. There were likewise between di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and distance Trumpets that sounded some mournful air. There was
nothing heard but fortunate acclamations of the Senate, Knights, Soldiers
and People. Some lamented <hi>Sylla,</hi> others feared him yet, though dead,
and the present spectacle did not terrifie them less than the remembrance of
his past actions; so that his Friends and Enemies remained of accord in this,
that to the last day of his life he was useful to the one, and dreadful to the
other: his Corps being set down in the place for Orations, the most elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Orator of the Age, mounting the Tribunal, made his Funeral Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
because his Son <hi>Faustus</hi> was not yet of age to pay him that Office.
After the Oration, some of the strongest Senators took the Litter upon
their Shoulders, and carried it to the Field of <hi>Mars,</hi> where they had been
accustomed to give Rights of Sepulture to none but Kings, and whilst the
Corps burnt, the Knights and all the Soldiery kept marching round about
the Pile.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXV"/> Scarce were <hi>Sylla's</hi> Funeral Ceremonies finished, but the Consuls, as
they returned began to quarrel with each other, and the people of the City
were divided in their favour. <hi>Lepidus,</hi> to curry favour with the people of
<hi>Italy,</hi> having said, That he would restore them the Lands <hi>Sylla</hi> had taken
away; whereupon the Senate, who feared them both, obliged them to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65196:161"/>
promise upon oath they would not take up Arms. Mean while, <hi>Lepidus,</hi>
to whom <hi>Gallia Cisalpina</hi> fell, in dividing the Provinces, staid till after the
Assembly for election of Magistrates, as if the year of his Consulate being
past, he had been discharged from his Oath, and free to make War upon
<hi>Sylla</hi>'s Party. But his Designs being known to all the world, the Fathers
sent him command to return to the City, and he knowing the cause of his
revocation, sets forward with all his Forces, with a resolution to enter
<hi>Rome</hi> with them, which being forbid him, he causes his command to be
proclaimed in the City for all those of his Party to take up Arms. <hi>Catulus</hi>
on his part does the like, so there was a Battel fought between them, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
distance from the Field of <hi>Mars. Lepidus</hi> was defeated, and forced to
fly into <hi>Sardinia,</hi> where he died of Sickness; and his Army, after having
troubled and over-run some places of <hi>Italy,</hi> mouldred away by little and
little, what remained of it was carried by <hi>Perpenna</hi> to <hi>Sertorins</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi>
who being the only General remaining of all <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Enemies, made yet
eight years War upon the Romans; they had a vast trouble to put an end
to this War, having not only the Spaniards to deal with, but likewise their
own Citizens under the conduct of <hi>Sertorius,</hi> who having obtained the
Government of that Province in the time he commanded <hi>Carbo</hi>'s Forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Sylla,</hi> had retired into <hi>Spain</hi> in Quality of Praetor, after having taken
<hi>Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssa</hi> during the Truce. This Government was disputed with him by those
that commanded, for they were of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Party, but he having joyned with
those Forces he led out of <hi>Italy</hi> some Auxiliaries of the Celtiberians drove
them out, and <hi>Metellus</hi> himself being by <hi>Sylla</hi> sent against him, he defended
himself generously. At length his valour having gained him a fair reputation,
he formed a Council of three hundred of his Friends, which he called a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
in derision to that at <hi>Rome. Sylla</hi> being dead, and some time after
him <hi>Lepidus, Sertorius</hi> recruited with the Forces brought him by <hi>Perpenna,</hi>
thought himself in a condition to mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h into <hi>Italy,</hi> and possibly he had done
it, if the Senate, who were fearful of it, had not sent <hi>Pompey</hi> with a new
Army to joyn the first: <hi>Pompey</hi> was yet but a young man, but already in
high esteem for those brave things he had done under <hi>Sylla</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> and
likewise in <hi>Italy:</hi> so he undertook this Expedition with great courage, and
to pass the <hi>Alpes</hi> after the example of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> he made a new way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Springs of the <hi>Po</hi> and the <hi>Rhosne,</hi> which are separated one from
the other only by some small Mountains, from whence these two Rivers go
to discharge themselves in two different Seas, the <hi>Rhosne</hi> into the Tyrhene
Sea, taking its course through the Transalpine Gaul, and <hi>Po</hi> into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Adriatick Gulf, gliding along the Cisalpine Gaul. As soon as
he got to <hi>Spain</hi> he lost a Legion, which he had sent to convoy his Foragers
Beasts of Loading, and Boys; nor could he hinder <hi>Sertorius</hi> from taking and
pillaging the Town of <hi>Aurona</hi> in the sight of him. In the taking of this
Town a certain Woman, exceeding the ordinary strength of her Sex, with
her Fingers thrust out the eyes of a man that would have ravished her,
which coming to <hi>Sertorius</hi>'s knowledge, he put the whole Cohort to death,
though they were all Romans, because they had already committed the like
crimes. Hereupon, Winter being come, the two Armies separated; but
at the beginning of the Spring they again took the Field. <hi>Metellus</hi> and
<hi>Pompey</hi> setting forth from the Pyraenean Hills where they kept their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Quarters, and <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Lusitania,</hi> they met near
<hi>Sucrona,</hi> and gave Battel; where as they were hotly engaged, there not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Cloud to be seen just before, on a sudden the Air was full of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Lightning, which would have passed for a Prodigy with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65196:162"/>
Armies; but these being all old Soldiers minded it not, nor did it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them from making a great Butchery on one side and the other: <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus</hi>
having defeated <hi>Perpenna,</hi> pillaged his Camp; but on the other Wing
<hi>Sertorius</hi> having wounded <hi>Pompey</hi> on the Thigh with a Javelin, routed
him, so that it is incertain which side had the better. <hi>Sertorius</hi> had a tame
white Hind which had used to go at liberty in the Fields, she having been
some days wanting, he counted it an ill presage, and as long as he thought
her lost, would not fight with the Enemy, who scoffed at him; but seeing
her come running to him, he took the Field, and rejoycing at her return as
a good Augur, began himself the Skirmish. Short time after there was
another great Battel fought near<note n="†" place="margin">Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

to Evening, without advantage on one part or the other: but at last <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
was fain to yield, after having lost six thousand Men, and <hi>Sertorius</hi> three
thousand; and for <hi>Metellus,</hi> he likewise cut in pieces five thousand of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penna</hi>'s
Men. The next day <hi>Sertorius</hi> taking along with him a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Barbarians, went in the Evening to assault <hi>Metellus</hi> his Camp, who
doubted of no such thing; and he had certainly forced it, if <hi>Pompey</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
timely relief had not put him by his Enterprise. Mean while, the
Summer being slipped away, both Armies parted, and went to their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Quarters. The year following, which agrees with the hundred se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
sixth Olympiad, the Roman Empire encreased two Provinces by the
last Testament of two Kings, <hi>Nicomedes</hi> having left to the Romans <hi>Bythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
and <hi>Ptolemy</hi> sirnamed <hi>Apion,</hi> of the Race of the <hi>Lagides,</hi> the Province
of <hi>Cyrene:</hi> but they had likewise great Wars; in <hi>Spain</hi> this we are now
speaking of; in the East with <hi>Mithridates;</hi> over all the Sea with the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates;
about <hi>Crete</hi> with the Inhabitants of the Island, and in <hi>Italy</hi> against
the Gladiators, who rose all upon a sudden, and gave them a great deal of
trouble. Though they had so many Affairs upon their Hands, yet they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
not to send to the Army they had in <hi>Spain</hi> two Legions, which being
arrived, <hi>Metellus</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> came down from the Pyraenean Mountains;
and <hi>Sertorius</hi> and <hi>Perpenna</hi> left <hi>Portugal</hi> to go meet them; when they drew
near, a great number of <hi>Sertorius's</hi> Soldiers went and yielded to <hi>Metellus,</hi>
which so angred <hi>Sertorius,</hi> that he treated many others with great cruelty,
and by his ill conduct got the hate of all the rest. But the greatest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
his Army made against him, was, that instead of Romans he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Celtiberians for his Guard, and chose rather to trust his person with
Strangers than those of his own Nation. They could not endure to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of infidelity, though they bore Arms under an Enemy of the Roman
People; and that which troubled them the more, was, that he, for whose
sake they had been perfidious to their Country, would not trust them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
they thought it very unjust, that they should be punished for Runa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
they who had kept constant to their duty. Moreover, this gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to the Celtiberians to tell them upon all occasions, that they doubted
of their fidelity. However, <hi>Sertorius</hi> was not quite forsaken, the Soldiers
standing in need of such a General; for indeed there was not any in this age
more successful, nor that better understood War: wherefore the Celtibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
because of his activity and diligence, called him <hi>Hannibal,</hi> whom
they esteemed the most hardy and most prudent General of all the Earth.
Upon these wavering inclinations of <hi>Sertor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us</hi>'s Army, <hi>Metellus</hi> went day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out in parties, and never returned without bringing in whole Troops of
Prisoners: and <hi>Pompey</hi> besieging <hi>Palenza</hi> had undermined the Walls, so
that they were only supported by Stanchions of Timber; but <hi>Sertorius</hi>
coming on, he was forced to raise his Siege, and the besiegers having set
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65196:162"/>
fire to the Stanchions, retreated with <hi>Metellus. Sertorius</hi> having repaired
that part of the Wall that was fallen, set himself to pursue the Enemies,
and overtook them on the Borders of <hi>Calagyra,</hi> and slew three thousand
Men, and this was all passed in <hi>Spain</hi> this year. In the beginning of the
next the Roman Generals finding themselves the stronger, assailed without
fear those Cities that held on <hi>Sertorius</hi>'s Party, whose Affairs were now in
an ill condition, and their first successes having heightened their courage,
they made great progress, yet there was no set Battel; but having conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
the War till the next year, they began to despise <hi>Sertorius</hi> in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that they wasted all his Province. For when he saw fortune had turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her back to him he gave ground too, and abandoned himself in such
manner to the pleasure of Wine and Women, that he never afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
the Enemy but he was beaten. He grew likewise extremely chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
his passion took fire on the least suspicion, punishing with cruelty, and
confiding in no man; so that <hi>Perpenna,</hi> who after <hi>Lepidus</hi>'s Death was
come of his own accord to joyn him with considerable Forces, began to fear,
and having suborned ten Soldiers, took a resolution to destroy him, but the
conspiracy was discovered, some of the Conspirators punished with death,
and others escaped by flight, <hi>Perpenna</hi> was so fortunate beyond his own
hopes, as not to be comprised in the accusation, which hastened so much the
more the loss of <hi>Sertorius;</hi> for seeing he never went unguarded, he invited
him to a Feast, where, after having made him drunk, and his Guards too,
he executed his enterprise. The Soldiers at the first knowledge of it detest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Parricide, and changed into good will all the hatred they bore <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torius,</hi>
as ordinarily all anger is appeased by the death of him from whom
we believe we have received an offence, they now stood no longer in fear
of him, and compassion recalled into their minds the memory of his virtue:
besides, they considered the danger to which they were now exposed to,
<hi>Perpenna</hi> was despised by them as a vulgar man; whereas they believed,
that on <hi>Sertorius</hi>'s valour only depended the safety of the whole Army. In
this general hate of <hi>Perpenna</hi> the Barbarians were most violent, especially
the Portugals, for whom the dead General had always a particular esteem.
But when after opening his Will they found his Murderer amongst his
Heirs, it is scarce possible to believe, how much it added to their horrour
of this Villany, committed upon the person, not only of his General, but
likewise of his Friend and Benefactor. And possibly they had done him
some violence, if he had not appeased them, some with gifts, and some
with promises, and killed some with his own hands to strike terrour into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
He went likewise from City to City, making Orations to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and to gain their good Will set at liberty those <hi>Sertorius</hi> had laid in
Irons, and returned the Hostages he had taken from the Spaniards. These
good deeds sweetened in some measure the minds of men; so that they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
him in quality of Praetor, and Successor to <hi>Sertorius;</hi> but yet they
were not quite appeased: for as soon as he saw himself settled, he grew
extraordinary cruel, killing three Roman Gentlemen had fled to him for
Refuge, and putting to death his Brother's Son. After <hi>Sertorius</hi>'s death,
<hi>Metellus</hi> withdrew to the other side of <hi>Spain,</hi> thinking there was no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in leaving <hi>Pompey</hi> alone to deal with <hi>Perpenna.</hi> They several times en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
and for divers days skirmished together to try their Men, but the
two Armies stirred not till on the tenth day, when they had a Battel: both
one Party and the other thinking it convenient to come to an end of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness;
for <hi>Pomp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y</hi> slighted <hi>Perpenna,</hi> whom he thought no great Captain;
and <hi>Perpenna</hi> fearing lest his men would not long continue in good order and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65196:163"/>
duty, made as much haste as he could to try the fortune of Arms. The
Fight was not long, <hi>Pompey</hi> having to deal with an ordinary Captain, and
an Army weak and discontented, soon got the advantage: so that scarce
any Stand being made, <hi>Perpenna</hi> took his flight in disorder, and fearing to
fall either into his Enemies, or his own mens hands, he hid himself in a
Thicket, from whence he was pulled out by some Horsemen that found him.
The Soldiers began to revile him, calling him the Murderer of <hi>Sertorius;</hi>
and he began to cry out aloud, that he had many things to discover to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi>
touching the Seditions of the City, whether it were true, or only an
invention to make them carry him alive before <hi>Pompey.</hi> But <hi>Pompey</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to dispatch him before he saw him; for fear left if he told
them any new thing it might occasion fresh calamities in the City; and
surely he did prudently; and all men praised his discretion. Thus the
death of <hi>Sertorius</hi> put an end to the Wars of <hi>Spain,</hi> which certainly had
lasted longer, and not been so easily determined, had he longer lived.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVI"/> About the same time <hi>Spartacus</hi> a Thracian by Nation, who had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
born Arms in the Roman Militia, and was now a Captive in <hi>Capua</hi> to serve
as a Gladiator, perswaded about seventy of his Comrades to fight rather for
their own liberty, than to please the spectators, and breaking Prison he gave
them such Arms as he took from Passengers, and went and posted himself
on Mount <hi>Vesuvius.</hi> Store of fugitive Slaves, and likewise some free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Country flocking to him upon the news of his Revolt, he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, and began to make Incursions and Robberies in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Places, he made <hi>Oenomaus</hi> and <hi>Crixus</hi> two Gladiators his Lieutenants,
and because he equally divided the Prey among his Companions, in a short
time he gathered together so great Forces, that first <hi>Varinius Glaber</hi> and
then <hi>P. Valerius</hi> being sent against him not with formed Bodies, but such
men as they could get together as they passed along, were beaten: for the
Roman People esteemed these only a concourse of Thieves, and not worth
the name of a War. <hi>Spartacus</hi> in the Fight took <hi>Varinius</hi>'s Horse, and
there mist little but that the Gladiator had taken the Pretor. After these
Victories such multitudes came in to him, that he soon beheld seventy thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Men under his Command. He then set himself to provide Arms, and
to make great Preparations; so that the Consuls were sent against him with
two Legions, one of which engaging with <hi>Crixus</hi> near Mount<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mount</hi> S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo.</note> 
                  <hi>Gorganus,</hi>
the Gladiator was killed with thirty thousand of his Men, scarce a third
part of his Army escaping: <hi>Spartacus</hi> having taken his March by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventine</hi> to gain the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and thence pass into <hi>Gaul,</hi> one of the Consuls
got before him to stop his passage, and the other Consul followed him at
the Heels. He fell upon them one after the other, and made them give
ground, and indeed put them to flight, in which the Vanquisher having
taken three hundred Roman Prisoners, he cut their Throats, and offered
them in sacrifice to <hi>Crixus</hi>'s Ghost, his forces being afterwards swelled to
sixscore thousand Men, he marched directly towards the City, and to make
the quicker way, caused all the Baggages to be burnt, his Prisoners mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
and his Beasts of Loading slain. Upon the way several Runaways
offered themselves to him, but he would accept of none. And when the
Consuls to stop his March, engaged him once more in the Country of<note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Marches of</hi> Ancona.</note> 
                  <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene,</hi>
he defeated them with a great loss of their Men. However, he
changed his design of going to the City, because he found himself too weak,
his Army not being sufficiently furnished with all things necessary for War:
for he was not aided by any Commonalty; and all his Forces were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65196:163"/>
of fugitive Slaves and Runnagate People. He went therefore and
seised upon the Mountains, and likewise of the City of <hi>Turine,</hi> and caused
Proclamation to be made, that he forbid all sorts of Merchants to bring any
Gold or Silver into the Camp, and all Soldiers to keep any: so with what
they had they bought Iron and Copper, without doing any wrong to those
which brought it; and by this means they got together abundance of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials,
with which they fixed themselves up Arms of all sorts. Mean
while they went dayly out a skirmishing, and having once more encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the Romans, gained the Victory, together with a good store of Spoil
and Booty. It was now three years that this formidable War had lasted,
which only for having contemned it at first, because of the meanness of the
Authors of it, was so prodigiously augmented, and withal the ancient Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Valour was so bastardifed, that when the Assembly was held for naming
of Praetors, there was none found that demanded that Dignity, till <hi>Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Crassus</hi> a man of Quality, and mighty rich, resolved to accept of the
Pretorship offered; and with six other Legions marched against <hi>Spartacus,</hi>
there were joyned to him the other two Legions which the Consuls had,
but he first decimated them as a punishment of those shameful losses they
had suffered: though some say, that going to assault the Enemies with all
the Legions together, and being beaten by their fault, he then decimated
them without considering the great number of Men, amounting to no less
than four thousand by which he weakened his Army. However it were,
after having managed so his Affairs, that his own men were more afraid of
him, than of the Enemy: ten thousand of <hi>Spartacus</hi>'s Army being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
severally, he fell suddenly upon them, and made so great a slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that scarce a third part escaped into the Gross, commanded by their
Captain. Soon after he undertook <hi>Spartacus</hi> himself, defeated him, and
drove him to the Sea side, where, as he laid a design to get over into <hi>Sicily,</hi>
to hinder him, he shut him up with a Circumvallation he drew round his
Camp, with a Ditch and Palisade. <hi>Spartacus</hi> seeing himself invested, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to break his way out, to get into the Country of the * Samnites,
but <hi>Crassus</hi> made him turn in again, after having killed him six thousand
Men in a Morning, and as many in the Evening, with the lose of only three
of his own, and seven wounded, so much did the recent memory of their
chastisement contribute to the Victory. After which <hi>Spartacus,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
some Horse which were to come to him from elsewhere, durst no
more engage with all his Forces, but contented himself to incommode
the Besiegers with frequent sallies, which he made sometimes on one side,
and sometimes on another, and with throwing flaming Faggots into the
Ditch, to burn the Palisade, and hinder the Work. Mean while he caused
one of the Roman Prisoners to be hanged up in the middle of the Place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Camp and <hi>Crassus</hi>'s Trenches, to let his men know what they
were to trust to, if they did not gain the Victory. The news of this cruelty
coming to the City, moved their spirits to indignation, that a War should
last so long against Gladiators. So that judging the Remains of it were not
despiseable, they gave order to <hi>Pompey,</hi> newly returned from <hi>Spain,</hi> to go
thither. But <hi>Crassus</hi> fearing lest <hi>Pompey</hi> should carry away all the Glory
of the end of this War, did all that he could possible to draw <hi>Spartacus</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to a Fight. On the other side, <hi>Spartacus,</hi> who thought it not convenient
to stay <hi>Pompey</hi>'s coming, sent to demand peace from <hi>Crassus,</hi> which being
refused him as a thing unworthy the Grandeur of <hi>Rome,</hi> and some Horse
being come to him, he resolved to try the fortune of a Battel, and having
with all his Army froced the Circumvallation, he took his way towards
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65196:164"/>
                  <hi>Brundusium,</hi> pursued by <hi>Crassus:</hi> but when he understood that <hi>Lucullus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to <hi>Rome</hi> after his Victory against <hi>Mithridates,</hi> was landed, he lost
all hopes of Retreat, and drew his Forces (which were yet numerous) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Battalia. The Fight was very fierce, <hi>Crassus</hi> having to deal with so many
thousand desperate people, till such time as <hi>Spartacus</hi> wounded in the Thigh
with a Javelin; fell upon his Knees, where still he defended himself for a
while, covered with his Buckler, but at last was killed with all that were
fighting about him, all the rest were presently routed, and there was
so great a Butchery, that the dead could hardly be counted, nor could they
find the body of <hi>Spartacus.</hi> The Romans lost scarce a thousand men. Those
that remained of <hi>Spartacus</hi>'s Men fled to the Mountains, whither <hi>Crassus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
followed them, to give the last stroke to the Victory, they formed of
what were left forty Battalions, and in that posture yet defended themselves
valiantly, till they were all killed, save six thousand, who were afterwards
hanged along the way between <hi>Capua</hi> and <hi>Rome. Crassus</hi> having done all this
in six Mouths, thought now he yielded nothing to <hi>Pompey</hi> in Glory, and
kept his Army as well as he. They both demanded the Consulate, <hi>Crassus</hi>
having passed the charge of Pretor according to <hi>Sylla</hi>'s Law, whereas <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
had neither been Pretor nor so much as Questor, and not above four
and thirty years old, but he promised the Tribunes to re-establish their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
power. Thus these two Generals designed Consuls, did not dismiss
their Armies, but kept them near the City, and shewed their reasons for it,
<hi>Pompey</hi> that he waited for <hi>Metellus,</hi> who ought to triumph at his return
from <hi>Spain;</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi> that <hi>Pompey</hi> ought first to dismiss his Forces. Now
the people seeing this difference tended to new Dissentions, and that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was besieged by two Armies, besought the Consuls who were eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
feated in the view of all in the great place, to be reconciled, at first both
the one and the other rejected their Prayers; but when the Divines told
them that the City was threatened with great miseries if the Consuls did not
agree, the people weeping, and casting themselves upon their Knees, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
the same entreaties, for they had not yet lost the memory of those
miseries caused by the Dissentions of <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Crassus</hi>
beginning first to be moved, rises from his Seat, and goes to present his hand
to his Colleague, as a sign of reconciliation: the other rising likewise went
to meet him, and having joyned hands, all the people made acclamations of
joy, wishing them all happiness; so that before the Assembly broke up,
both Consuls dismissed their Armies. Thus was the Common-wealth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
delivered from the fear of a Civil War. And this happened sixty
years after the death of <hi>Tiberius Gracchus</hi> the first mover of Seditions.</p>

THe Dominion of <hi>Sylla,</hi> and all those things which passed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
in <hi>Spain</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Sertorius</hi> and <hi>Perpenna<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
were followed by divers Commotions, till the Civil War of
<hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> which ended by the death of <hi>Pompey;</hi> after
which <hi>Caesar</hi> himself was slain in the Senate, as may be seen in
this Second Book of the Civil Wars. Now when <hi>Pompey</hi> had cleared all
the Seas of Pyrates, than whom a greater Number was never seen in the
Memory of Man; brought to his end <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
his Kingdom and those other Countries he had conquered into what
Form he pleased. <hi>Caeser</hi> was yet but a very young Man; he was Eloquent,
Capable of great things, Hardy, Presumptuous, Ambitious beyond his
Power; and being yet but Aedile and Praetor, was run prodigiously in debt
to gain the favour of the People, which is usually given to the most prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal.
<hi>Catiline</hi> now likewise appeared at <hi>Rome,</hi> being of one of the best Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
of the City, but of no sound Wisdom; and besides, of an ill Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being suspected to have committed a Parricide on his own Son, that
he might espouse <hi>Aurelia Oristilla,</hi> whom he was in Love with, and who
would not contract Marriage with him as long as he had Children. He was
with all this, a great Friend of <hi>Sylla</hi>'s, and very affectionate to his Party.
Being fallen into Poverty by his ambitious Profuseness, and yet considerable
among many powerful Persons, as well Men as Women, he set himself to
demand the Consulate, as a Step to raise him to the Tyranny: But he fell
from his hopes; most Men having conceived an ill Opinion of him, because
they perceived him affect an Authority not fit to be suffered in a Free City.
Being then refused the Consulate, which was given to <hi>Cicero,</hi> a Man well
spoken of, and very eloquent, he began to mock at the Suffrages of the
People who had chosen this Consul, whom out of Raillery he called New
Man (for they had got a custom to give that name to those who rendred
themselves Illustrious, not by the Glory of their Ancestors, but their own
proper Vertue) and because that he was not born in the City, they said that
he was an Inmate, like those that lie in hired Lodgings. After that time
he medled no more with the Government of the Commonwealth; judging
that it exposes Men to Trouble and Envy, and sets them not a Round high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
towards mounting to the Tyranny. Notwithstanding, he drew great
Summs of Money from many of those Women, who, weary of their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
hoped to get rid of them if any Change happened in the State: and
with some Senators, a quantity of Roman Knights, Plebeians, Slaves,
nay, very Strangers, formed a Conspiracy to seize on the Commonwealth:
But his greatest Confidents in this Affair were <hi>Cornelius Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Cethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi>
at that present Proetors of the City. He sent likewise throughout all
<hi>Italy</hi> people to solicite those who being enriched in <hi>Sylla</hi>'s time, had ill spent
what they had ill got, and would be very well content to reach at such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fortune. He sent <hi>C. Manlius</hi> to <hi>Fesulae,</hi> and others to the Marches of
<hi>Ancona,</hi> and into <hi>Pouilla,</hi> secretly to levy Soldiers. The first advice of all
these secret Preparations was given to <hi>Cicero</hi> by <hi>Fulvia,</hi> a Woman of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
with whom <hi>Q. Curius</hi> (one of the Conspirators, expelled the Senate
for his scandalous life) was deeply in Love: He boasted to his Mistress, that
in a short time she should see him a great Lord. Already the noise of the
Attempts of those who had been sent throughout all <hi>Italy</hi> increased, when
the Consul set Guards in the City, and sent certain Persons of Quality to
the suspected Places. But <hi>Catiline,</hi> though no one durst yet arrest him,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65196:166"/>
because the business was not absolutely discovered, was fearful lest Delay
should increase the Suspition; and hoping that the greatest diligence would
be most advantageous to him, sent Money before to <hi>Fesulae,</hi> gave Order to
the Conspirators to kill <hi>Cicero,</hi> and be night to set fire on divers Quarters of
the City; and he causing Rods and Axes to be bore before him as a Pro-Consul,
and raising Soldiers all the way he passed, goes to find out <hi>Caius
Manlius,</hi> with design to fall upon the City as soon as it should be set on fire
with all the Forces he could get together. As for <hi>Lentulus,</hi> after having
given to the Conspirators every one his Quarter, <hi>Cethegus</hi> and he agreed that
as soon as they should have advice that <hi>Catiline</hi> was arrived at <hi>Fesulae,</hi> they
should go with Daggers under their Robes very early in the morning to
<hi>Cicero</hi>'s House, where by reason of their Offices they might without diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
get entrance; and drawing him into a private place under pretence of
some secret Conference, stab him. That at the same time<note n="*" place="margin">Tribune of the People.</note> 
                  <hi>Lucius Sextus</hi>
should assemble the People, and accuse <hi>Cicero,</hi> that being fearful by Nature,
and suspitious without cause, he unseasonably and to ill purpose troubled the
City; and that the night following with a Band of Conspirators they should
set fire in twelve places, pillage the City, and kill all the honest people they
met with. Whilst <hi>Lentulus, Cethegus, Statilius</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> who were the
Heads of the Conspiracy, formed these Designs, and waited only for Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to execute them, the Deputies of the<note n="†" place="margin">Savoy <hi>and the</hi> Dauphinate</note> Allobroges being come to
<hi>Rome</hi> to complain of their Magistrates, were drawn into this Conspiracy
out of hopes they would cause the Gauls to rise against the Republick. <hi>Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidus</hi>
being about to send them to <hi>Catiline,</hi> accompanied with <hi>Vulturtius</hi> of
<hi>Crotona,</hi> who carried Letters without Superscription: The Allobroges, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolute
what they had to do, discoursed the matter with <hi>Fabius Sanga,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
of their City; for it is the custom of the Provincials, that each Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath his Protector at <hi>Rome. Cicero</hi> having received this advice from
<hi>Sanga,</hi> gave Order to arrest the Deputies as they were upon their Return,
and with them <hi>Vulturtius;</hi> who being brought into full Senate, confessed
all that they had negotiated with <hi>Lentulus,</hi> and attested that they had often
heard him say, that the Destinies had promised the Dominion of the City
to three <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s; of which <hi>Cinna</hi> and <hi>Sylla</hi> had been the two first, and
he should be the third. Hereupon the Senate degraded <hi>Lentulus</hi> of his Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Senator, and <hi>Cicero</hi> went to cause the Conspirators to be arrested;
whom having placed under sure Guards in the Praetors Houses, he returned
to the Senate to deliberate. Mean while the knowledge of this Affair not
being yet publick, a great Tumult was raised about the Palace; and all the
Accomplices of the Conspirators took the Alarm; in so much, that the
Slaves and Freed Men of <hi>Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Cethegus</hi> having raised a great number
of Artisans, used their endeavours to break open the Back Doors of the
Praetors, to take thence their Masters by force: Which being told <hi>Cicero,</hi>
he came hastily out of the Senate; and having placed Courts of Guard eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where, returns and presses the Senate to give their Judgments. The
first whose Advice was demanded was <hi>Sillanus,</hi> designed Consul; for it is
the Custom to being to demand Opinions by those nominated to that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
because, as I imagine, the Execution of the Senate's Decrees regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
them, they ought to utter their mind with more Circumspection and
Prudence. His Advice was, the Conspirators should be punished with
death; in which many others followed him. <hi>Nero</hi> speaking in his trun,
was of opinion they should for some time be kept Prisoners, till <hi>Catiline</hi> was
defeated, and they more fully informed of the matter; which was also the
Opinion of <hi>C. Caesar,</hi> who was in some kind suspected as if a Partner in their
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65196:166"/>
designs, or at least to have had knowledge of them: of which however,
the Consul spoke not a word; not daring to cope with a Man so beloved of
the People. He added to <hi>Nero</hi>'s advice, that they should be distributed in
the Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> such as <hi>Cicero</hi> should chuse; and after the War was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
be called to Judgment; for it was not reasonable to condemn Persons
of that Quality, without granting them a formal Tryal. This seemed just,
and many returned to this Opinion, till <hi>Cato</hi> openly declaring his suspition
of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and the Consul fearing that the night following a multitude of
Conspirators which were now in the Palace, and in fear for themselves,
should attempt some desperate Action, brought back the greatest part of the
Senators to the Opinion, that the Conspirators being taken in a Flagrant Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
ought to suffer without being allowed the Formality of a Process. In
so much, that before the Senate rose, <hi>Cicero</hi> himself caused the Accused to
be brought from the particular Houses where they were guarded, to the
Prison; where, without the knowledge of the People, he caused the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of death to be executed in his presence; then going to the place, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
to all the World, they were no longer among the Living. Hereupon
the rest of the Conspirators dispersed, every one contenting himself that he
had escaped; and the City was that day delivered from great Inquietude.
<hi>Catiline</hi> had already assembled twenty thousand men, about the fourth part
of which were armed; with which he took his March towards <hi>Gaul,</hi> where
he hoped to compleat his Preparations: But <hi>Anthony,</hi> the other Consul, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaking
him near the <hi>Alps,</hi> defeated him without much pains; for as he
had laid this Design with little Prudence, so he as imprudently managed it,
and was forced to fight before he was prepared. Notwithstanding, most
true it is, that neither <hi>Catiline</hi> nor any of those Persons of Quality with him
would fly, but were all slain fighting in the midst of their Enemies. The
death of <hi>Catiline</hi> was the end of this Conspiracy, from which <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
secured the Commonwealth: So that being before known only for
his Eloquence, he in this Occasion made himself famous for his Actions;
and no Person doubted but he had saved his Country from the Ruin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it was threatned. Wherefore publick thanks were given him: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
many Acclamations, <hi>Cato</hi> saluting him, called him <hi>The Father of his
Country:</hi> Which is indeed an Appellation so glorious, that <hi>Cicero</hi> having
been the first to whom it was given for his Merit, it is the Custom to this
day to honour only such Emperors with it as are worthy: For as soon as any
come to the Monarchy they joyn not this Title with their other Sirnames,
nor is it granted but by a publick Decree, and as a Testimony of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
Vertue.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Caesar,</hi> being ready to go for <hi>Spain,</hi> the Government of which he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
had obtained, he was arrested by his Creditors, whom he could not pay,
having dreined himself by Ambitious Expences; and he was heard at that
time to say, that he wanted<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>According to</hi> Buda<hi>'s Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, this will not amount to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Pounds.</hi> Plutarch <hi>says he owed one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty Talents; which according to the same Compatation of</hi> Buda, <hi>will be one hundred ninety five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Pounds.</hi>
                  </note> two Millions and five hundred Thousand De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers
to be worth nothing. He agreed with them as well as he could; and
being entred into his Government, he amused not himself to go from City
to City to hear talk of Affairs, or to administer Justice; such things had no
Correspondency with the Greatness of his Designs: But he began to raise
Soldiers, and to make War with the rest of the People of <hi>Spain;</hi> whom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having plundred their Territories, he made Tributary to the Romans:
In so much, that having sent a great Summ of Money to the Treasury, the
Senate granted him the Honour of Triumph. As they were making in the
Suburbs Magnificent Preparation for his Entry, the day designed for the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65196:167"/>
Election of Consuls drawing nigh, of necessity those who demanded that
Dignity must be present; and it was not permitted after entring the City
without Pomp, to make another Entry in Triumph. He had a long time
passionately desired the Consulate, and the things necessary for his Triumph
were not yet ready: Wherefore he presented a Request to the Senate, that
he might have permission to demand that Dignity by his Friends, which he
knew had been granted others, though it were forbid by the Law. The
last day being come whereon those that pretend to the Consulate must give
in their Names, and <hi>Cato</hi> continually opposing <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Request, he renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
his Triumph, entred into the City, and made his Declaration, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the day of the Assembly. Mean time <hi>Pompey,</hi> Illustrious and Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
because of the great Actions he had done against <hi>Mithridates,</hi> deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the Senate the Ratification of many things he had granted to Kings,
Tetrarchs and Cities, which many opposed out of the Envy they bore this
Great Man: But especially <hi>Lucullus;</hi> who being recalled out of <hi>Asia</hi> when
he had quite weakned the Forces of that King, having left the same <hi>Pompey</hi>
that War easie to terminate, vaunted that the Honour of that Victory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to him; and had drawn <hi>Crassus</hi> to his side. <hi>Pompey</hi> vexed that his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
were opposed, makes Alliance with <hi>Caesar,</hi> promising him upon Oath
that he would serve him to get the Consulship; and soon after by <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
means <hi>Crassus</hi> was reconciled to <hi>Pompey.</hi> Thus these three great Men served
one another, to obtain what they desired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the Historian <hi>Varro,</hi> who writ
a Book of their Union, calls it the Three-headed Conspiracy. Wherefore
the Senate beginning to suspect their Power, gave to <hi>Caesar, L. Bibulus</hi> his
Enemy for his Colleague; between whom there soon happened such a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
as made them take up Arms, one agaist the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> But <hi>Caesar</hi> knowing the Art of Dissembling, made in full Senate an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Bibulus</hi> upon the Subject of Concord, as if he would prevent their
Dissentions from causing any Inconveniency to the Commonwealth. Now,
whilst it seemed in all outward appearance that he endeavoured seriously for
Peace, and that the other, who doubted nothing, stood not upon his Guard,
all on a suddain he comes to the Senate accompanied with a great Multitude
of People, and proposes a Law in favour of the Poor: He distributed Lands
to them; gave to them that were Fathers of three Children <hi>Campania,</hi> the
most fertile Territory belonging to <hi>Italy;</hi> and by this means got the Love
and favour of the People, for there were twenty thousand found under that
Qualification. And when many of the Senate opposed the Publication of
these Laws, he withdrew from the Palace, as if not able to endure their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice;
and all that Year there was no more Session of the Senate. But he
went to the place for Orations; and mounting the Tribunal, demanded of
<hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus,</hi> who still assisted him, if those Laws did not to them
seem reasonable, and after having received their approbation, demanded
the suffrages of the people, who came to that Assembly with Arms under
their Gowns. As for the Fathers (for the Senate could not Assemble but
by the order of both Consuls) they held some private meetings in <hi>Bibulus</hi>
house, but all that did nothing against the Power and Interest of <hi>Caesar,</hi>
yet they ceased not to provoke <hi>Bibulus</hi> to oppose the Laws of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league,
whatever should happen by it: That it might rather be said
he was overcome by the Malice of another, than by his own remiss<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
He ventured therefore upon the place one day as <hi>Caesar</hi> was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an Oration to the people, and a Tumult arising about some words
they had together, they came to blows. <hi>Bibulus</hi> his Rods were broken,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65196:167"/>
and some Tribunes that took his part wounded, but he without being
daunted, presented his naked Neck to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Faction, with these words;
<hi>If I cannot perswade my Colleague what is just, I will at least by my death make
him Criminal and Execrable.</hi> However, his Friends pulled him thence,
and caused him to enter the Temple of <hi>Iupiter Stator,</hi> which is nigh the
place. Then <hi>Cato</hi> being strong and vigorous, overthrew all those stood in
his way, got up into an eminent place, and began to speak; but those of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s
Party drew him out of the place: which yet made him not give over;
for he returned again by another way, crying out continually against <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar;</hi>
till being again carried away by force, the Consul got the Laws past.
The People having sworn to observe them, they would have the Senators
take the same Oath; which some by <hi>Cato</hi>'s perswasion having refused to do,
he proposed to the People, to declare Criminal whoever would not swear:
And this Declaration being passed, they all took the Oath for fear; even
the Tribunes themselves, who had opposed in vain, since the Law was rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
Mean while a certain man of the People called <hi>Vetius</hi> ran into the
middle of the place, crying out he was sent by <hi>Bibulus, Cicero</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> to
kill <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey;</hi> and that Dagger was to that purpose put in his hand
by <hi>Posthumius,</hi> Lictor to <hi>Bibulus.</hi> Though this matter were much suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Caesar</hi> made use of it to embitter the Multitude, and referred the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
till the next day; but <hi>Vetius</hi> was the night following killed in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
This Accident admitted of divers Interpretations; but <hi>Caesar</hi> cast the
fault on some who had a sense of their being guilty; and managed things so,
that the People permitted him to take Guards, to secure him from such At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
as might be made upon his Person. And now <hi>Bibulus</hi> quitted abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
the Government of the Commonwealth, and remained in his house
as a private Person all the Remainder of his Consulate. But his Colleague
seeing himself Master of all, without troubling himself to make any Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
about <hi>Vetius</hi> business, laboured to make more Laws in favour of the
People; and according to his promise, made all that <hi>Pompey</hi> had done to be
approved. In these times the Knights, who were the middle Order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Senate and the People; powerful, both by reason of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Riches, and the Profits which they made of the Imposts which they far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from the People, highly courted <hi>Caesar;</hi> in so much, that supported by
his favour, they presented their Request to the Senate for an Abatement of
the Rent of their Farms: And when the Fathers demurred upon, and
withstood it, without taking notice of their Oppositions, by the sole consent
of the People he abated them a third part. Whereupon the Knights ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received a greater favour than they demanded or durst hope for, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up to the Skies him from whom they had received it: And now <hi>Caesar</hi>
grew stronger than he was before in the favour of the People, for by this
only benefit he gained a great number of interessed Persons to sustain his
Dignity. Besides all this, to gain so much the more the good Grace of the
Citizens, he gave them often the Divertisements of Shows and Chases; by
which he ran in debt every where, much beyond what he was worth, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day surpassing himself in the Magnificence of his Gifts, and the Profuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Largesses. At last he brought Matters so about, that they gave
him the Government of the Gauls, as well on this side as beyond the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
for five Years, with fonr Legions. After having obtained it, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he must be a long time absent from the City, and that Envy has
more power than Favour, he gave his Daughter in Marriage to <hi>Pompey;</hi>
not but that they were already very good Friends, but he was fearful left the
too great Success of his Arms might stir up Envy even in a Friend. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65196:168"/>
he designed for Consuls the Year following the stoutest of his Faction,
<hi>A. Gabinius,</hi> one of his greatest Confidents; and <hi>L. Piso,</hi> his Father in
Law, with whom he had lately Allyed himself (<hi>Cato</hi> perpetually crying out
that these Marriages tended to a Tyranny) and for Tribunes of the People
he nominated <hi>Vatinius</hi> and <hi>Clodius Pulcher.</hi> This <hi>Clodius</hi> was infamous for
having slipped into the Sacrifices of the good Goddess, where none but
Women ought to enter: in which place he had layed a Blemish upon the
Chastity of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s own Wife; who yet never expressed any Resentment,
because this Man was beloved by the People; but however he repudiated
his Wife, there were some who afterwards made him come to a Tryal as a
Prophaner of Sacred Things. <hi>Cicero</hi> pleaded his Accusation, and <hi>Caesar</hi>
himself was called in as a Witness; but he deposed nothing against him:
On the contrary, he advanced him to this Office of Tribune in hate to <hi>Cicero,</hi>
who frequently used to blame the Union of<note n="*" place="margin">Pompey, Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, Caesar.</note> these three Men, as tending to
the Ruin of the Publick Liberty. Nor thought he much to pardon one of
his Enemies the Affront he had received, so he might be revenged of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who had only offended him in suspecting he had an ill Design; so
much was his Ambition more violent than his Love. And yet there is some
appearance that <hi>Caesar</hi> received the first Obligation from <hi>Clodius,</hi> who served
him with all his Credit and Interest when he demanded the Government of
the Gauls. However it were, this is what passed in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Consulate;
which being expired, he went into the Province in Quality of Pro-Consul.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> After his departure from the City, <hi>Clodius</hi> caused <hi>Cicero</hi> to be called to
Judgment, for having contrary to Law put to death <hi>Cethegus</hi> and <hi>Lentulus</hi>
before they were condemned. But he bore this Accusation with as much
Cowardice, as he had shewed Courage in the Noble Action he did; for he
went through the Streets with his Beard grown, his Hair unkembed, clad
in a sad Colour, and begging of every one he met to assist him, he was not
ashamed to be importunate with People that were utterly unknown to him;
in so much, that having no regard to Decency, whilst he would have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Compassion, he made himself ridiculous; and that Man who all his
life had managed others Affairs with so much Courage, suffered himself to
fall into the Excess of Fear in his own Cause. It is reported, the like hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to <hi>Demosthenes</hi> in <hi>Athens;</hi> and that Orator who had so bravely defended
so many accused, being accused himself, chose rather to fly than to defend
himself before the Judges. In like manner <hi>Cicero</hi> seeing that <hi>Clodius,</hi> whom
he followed through the Streets in the posture of a Suppliant, derided his
Prayers and Submissions, and reviled him with words, lost all hope, and
resolved to go into a Voluntary Exile, whither many of his Friends follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, the Senate having given him Letters of Recommendation to all
Kings and Sovereigns where he designed to make his Retreat. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Clodius</hi> demolished his Houses as well in the City as the Country; and
became so fierce and arrogant, that he esteemed himself equal to <hi>Pompey,</hi>
the most powerful Man of that time in the City. Wherefore <hi>Pompey</hi> made
an Agreement with <hi>Milo</hi> his Colleague, a Man of Enterprize; to whom
he promised the Consulate, to serve him against <hi>Clodius,</hi> and obliged him
to propose to the People the Return of <hi>Cicero;</hi> believing that being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
he could talk no more of the present Estate of the Commonwealth,
that he would have in mind the benefit newly received, and be always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to oppose the designs of <hi>Clodius.</hi> Thus <hi>Cicero</hi> banished by <hi>Pompey</hi>'s means,
was by the favour of the same <hi>Pompey</hi> again recalled to his Country, about
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65196:168"/>
sixteen Months after his departure, and his Houses both in City and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
were rebuilt at the Publick Charge. When he returned there went such
a Concourse to meet him at the Gates, that the whole Day was scarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for their Complements; which happened also to <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> when
after his Exile he was received into <hi>Athens.</hi> Mean while <hi>Caesar,</hi> glorious
for the great things he had done in <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Brittany</hi> (as we have said,
speaking of the Affairs of <hi>Gaul</hi>) and loaden with vast Riches, repassed into
<hi>Cisalpine Gaul,</hi> that he might a little refresh his Army, wearied with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
War. As soon as he was arrived there, and that he had sent store of
Silver to a great many Persons in the City, the Officers of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
for that Year, together with all the other Governors of Provinces,
and Generals of other Armies, came to salute him; so that there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
sixscore Rods about his Person. There came likewise more than two
hundred Senators; some to thank him for Favours received, some to get
Money of him, or something else of that kind. For now he alone could do
all things, having so many Forces at his Service, and so much Money in his
Coffers; and besides, he was always ready to oblige all the World. <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
and <hi>Crassus,</hi> the Companions of his Power, being come as well as others
to see him, they consulted together about their Affairs; and agreed, that
<hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi> should take the Consulate, and should prolong to <hi>Caesar</hi>
the Government of <hi>Gaul</hi> for other five Years; after which they parted. At
the time for Election of Consuls, <hi>Domitius Aenobarbus</hi> standing up Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor
with <hi>Pompey,</hi> and the day of Nomination being come, they came
both before Day to the place where the Assembly is held; and after some
sharp words, fell to blows. In the Tumult he that carried the Light before
<hi>Domitius</hi> received a Wound with a Sword, upon which all his People fled,
and he with much hazard escaped to his House: <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Robe was also
brought home bloody; so much danger did they both run in this sudden
Broil. <hi>Crassus</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> having obtained the Consulate, gave <hi>Caesar,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their promise, the Government of <hi>Gaul</hi> for five Years longer,
and between themselves they divided the Provinces and the Armies. <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
had the Governments of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> whither he sent Friends to
command in his place, and he stayed in the City: And <hi>Syria,</hi> with all the
Neighbouring Countries remained to <hi>Crassus;</hi> for his Head run upon a
War against the Parthians, as a thing easie, and which would yield no less
Glory than Profit. But when he left the City to go towards it, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
a great many ill Presages: The Tribunes of the People forbad him to
go to make War against the Parthians, from whom the People of <hi>Rome</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
received any Cause of Complaint: And because he did not forbear at
their defence, they cursed him with publick Execrations; in contempt of
which having passed farther, he perished in the Enemy's Country, with all
his Army, together with a Son he had of the same name; for of a hundred
thousand Men he lead thither, scarce ten thousand escaped into <hi>Syria.</hi> But
we have spoke of this Defeat in what we have already writ of the Affairs of
<hi>Parthia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The People about this time being oppressed with Famine, gave to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
the Superintendence of Provisions; and as he had done before in the
Pyratick War, so now he named twenty Senators for his Lieutenants in this
Employ: By sending of whom into the several Provinces, he in a short time
filled the City with great abundance of all things necessary to the Life of
Man; which much augmented his Glory and Power. At the same time
<hi>Iulia, Pompey</hi>'s Wife, dyed great with Child, and by her death left all the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65196:169"/>
City in Alarm, for fear left the Alliance between <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> being
exterminate, they should not e'er long take up Arms against each other;
for now for a long time there had been nothing but Disorder and Confusion
in the Commonwealth. No Dignities were attained to but by Factions, or
by Gifts, or by Criminal Service, and sometimes by blows of Stones and
strokes of Swords. No man was ashamed to buy Votes, for the People
sold them in open Assembly. In short, there was one, who, to obtain an
Office in the Commonwealth; spent<note n="*" place="margin">About one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty thousand pounds Sterling.</note> eight hundred Talents. Besides, the
yearly Consuls now made had no hopes to make War or to command
Armies; being excluded by the Management and Workings of the
three sworn Friends. III men enriched themselves with publick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
or by taking Bribes from those they designed for their Successor;
wherefore no honest Man would put in for an Office; in so much that in this
Disorder the Commonwealth was eight Months without Officers. <hi>Pompey</hi>
set his hand to all this, that they might be obliged to chuse a Dictator; and
it was openly talked already in the Companies, that there was no other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for the Present Distempers, than by giving the Sovereign Authority
to some Person of Probity and Power. This Discourse could mean no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than <hi>Pompey,</hi> who commanded great Armies, and seemed affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to the Publick Good, respectful to the Senate, modest, prudent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable
by all Men for his Courtesie, whether true or feigned. <hi>Pompey</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by his words, not to be at all rejoyced with the Opinion the Citizens
had of him; nay, he seemed to be troubled at it: but yet he did all that
was possible secretly to advance the Execution of his Designs. He fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Disorders of the Commonwealth by leaving it without Magistrates:
And though <hi>Milo,</hi> who was now Tribune, had served him in the reducing
of <hi>Clodius,</hi> yet he hindred him from demanding the Consulate; still tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing,
till <hi>Milo,</hi> vexed to see himself so deceived, left the City, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to <hi>Lavinia,</hi> the place of his Birth: That City is reported to be the first
built by <hi>Aeneas</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> nineteen Miles from <hi>Rome.</hi> As he was going,
<hi>Clodius</hi> on Horse-back was by chance returning out of the Country, to the
City: they met about <hi>Bovilles,</hi> and passed by without saluting each other;
but a Servant of <hi>Milo</hi>'s, whether he had received Command to do it, or
that of his own accord he would rid his Master of an Enemy, fell upon <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> and with his Sword, cut him into the Head that he fell: His Groom
carried him into the next Inn, whither <hi>Milo</hi> with all his Followers hasting to
him, in the uncertainty he was in, whether he were yet dead, or that there
was some life left in him, thrust him into the Belly; protesting, that what
had before passed was without his order or consent, but he willingly finished
a Crime, for which he knew he must answer. The People astonished with
the report of this Accident, spent all that night in the place in Arms; and
when it was day, the Body was brought before the Tribunal for Orations:
Soon after it was taken up by some Tribunes his Friends, assisted by the
Multitude: Who, whether it were to honour this Man of the Senatorian
Order, or to shame the Senate, who by their negligence seemed to favour
such Actions, carried him into the Palace; where some of the most violent
of them, breaking down the Benches, made a Pile; and setting fire to it,
burnt not only the Body, but likewise the Palace and some Private Houses
adjoyning. As for <hi>Milo,</hi> he still had so much boldness, that the fear he
stood in of being punished for such an Assassinate was much less than his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
to see so much Honour payed to the Memory of <hi>Clodius.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
taking in his Train great numbers of Country People, together with
his own Houshold: And having gained the People by Largesses, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65196:169"/>
                  <hi>M. Cecilius,</hi> Tribune, with Money, he came to the City full of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.
As soon as he appeared, <hi>Cecilius</hi> arrested him in the midst of the
Street, and led him as it were by force into the place where those who had
received his Presents were assembled, under pretence of making him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
for his Action. The Tribune seemed to be so enraged against him,
that he would not grant him any time to prepare himself for his Defence:
But indeed he pressed the business out of hopes that <hi>Milo</hi> being acquitted by
this Judgment, might not be obliged to answer before other Judges. <hi>Milo</hi>
having at first declared that this Death was not premeditated, for had he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such design he would never have taken his Wife and whole Family along
with him to execute it, spent the rest of his time in Invectives against <hi>Clodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
who he would have pass for a debauched Cast-away, and the Head of
those Debauchees who, in burning his Body, had burnt the Palace. Before
he had finished his Speech, the other Tribunes of the People and the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
who had not been corrupted by his Presents, came running into the
place, from whence <hi>Cecilius</hi> and <hi>Milo</hi> withdrew disguised like Slaves; yet
they failed not to make a great Slaughter, making no distinction between
<hi>Milo</hi>'s Friends and others; but charged indifferently on the Citizens and
those that were none; especially on those were best clad, or had about them
any rich Ornaments which they had a mind to; for there being no Form of
a Commonwealth, in the first Tumult that happened every Man gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
over to Rage and Passion. And because in this Occasion numbers of
Slaves had taken Arms against People that had none, they set themselves to
rob, and run into Houses to see what they could catch, under pretence to
seek for <hi>Milo</hi>'s Friends. Thus some Days passed in these Disorders, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Fire and Stones, and all other Instruments of Fury and Rage were made
use of. Mean while the Senate affrighted, assembled in the Palace, and
cast their eyes on <hi>Pompey,</hi> as if they designed him presently Dictator; and
indeed there appeared no other Remedy for the Miseries wherewith the
Commonwealth was oppressed. But <hi>Cato</hi> disswaded the Fathers, and
brought them to his Opinion, to make him Consul without a Colleague;
so that he might have the Power of a Dictator, disposing all things alone,
but was subject to be called to an Account of his Administration, according
to ancient Custom. Being then the first that ever was created Consul alone,
Governor of two great Provinces, General of an Army, and powerful in
Treasure; he obtained the Sovereign Authority in the Commonwealth by
the Advice of <hi>Cato</hi> himself; who gave him his Vote for fear he should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Voyage to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> whither he was to go to reduce that Kingdom into
the Form of a Province. <hi>Clodius</hi> had got it so decreed, to revenge himself
of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> King of that Island; who, out of Covetousness, had contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
but two Talents to redeem him from Pyrates when he was formerly
taken. And <hi>Cato,</hi> when he went, had not much trouble to settle the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> for as soon as the King had advice of the Decree of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and People of <hi>Rome,</hi> he threw all his Treasure into the Sea, and killed
himself.</p>
               <p>At first Entrance into his Charge <hi>Pompey</hi> brought to a Tryal all those who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/>
stood accused of any Crime, particularly of Corruption or Ill Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in their Offices; for this he thought the Original of all Publick Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
and that having purged that Humour, the Commonwealth would
soon recover its former Vigour. He therefore made a Law, by which leave
was given to demand an Account of all those who had exercised any Office
from the time that he was first made Consul, to his present Consulate. Now
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65196:170"/>
this space of time being almost twenty years, comprised likewise the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulate
of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and those of his Party had some suspicion that it was done
to affront him; for why run so far back? they remonstrated therefore to
<hi>Pompey,</hi> that it was more convenient to provide against present Evils, than
to go to rip up old fores, and put to pain so many considerable persons, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom they named <hi>Caesar</hi> himself. He seemed to take it amiss they
had alledged <hi>Caesar,</hi> as not being suspected with any of those crimes; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
he reduced the time to begin from his second Consulate, but
he would not utterly suppress the Law, saying, that the punishment of
these crimes was of great importance towards the re-establishment of a
perfect good order in the Common-wealth. After this Law was ratified,
great number of Processes were formed, and that the Judges might be
free from all fear, himself sate President, attended by a strong Guard of
Soldiers. The first condemned in their absence were <hi>Milo</hi> for the death of
<hi>Clodius, Gabinius</hi> convicted to have violated Humane and Divine Right, by
entring armed into <hi>Egypt</hi> without the order of the Senate, and against the
prohibition of the Sibyls; with <hi>Hypsaeus, Memmius, Sextus,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for having bought their Offices. As for <hi>Scaurus,</hi> when many people
tumultuously entreated for him, <hi>Pompey</hi> caused the Usher with a loud voice
to tell them they should expect the sentence of the Judges; and because
notwithstanding they continued to make a great broil with the Accusers.
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s Soldiers fell upon and killed some of them; so after silence made,
<hi>Scaurus</hi> was condemned to Banishment; and for <hi>Gabinius,</hi> besides Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
his Goods were confiscate. The Senate after having given praises to
<hi>Pompey,</hi> augmented his Forces with two Legions, and extended his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over all the Provinces of the Empire. Some days after, the Law of
<hi>Pompey</hi> promising impunity to whoever would accuse another: <hi>Memmius</hi>
one of the condemned summoned to Judgment <hi>L. Scipio</hi> Father-in-law to
<hi>Pompey,</hi> and guilty of the same crime: upon which, <hi>Pompey</hi> having chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
habit: imitated him; and <hi>Memmius,</hi> after having complained of the
ill orders in the Common-wealth, let fall his suit.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> And now as if the time of his Dictatorship were expired, <hi>Pompey</hi>
made <hi>Scipio</hi> his Colleague for the rest of his Consulate. Notwithstanding
he laboured hard for those were to succeed him in that Dignity, keeping
the same power he had before, and disposing alone of all things in the
City; for the Senate had so great an affection for him, that <hi>Caesar</hi> grew jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.
And indeed in his Consulate he had not at all considered that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Order, whereas <hi>Pompey</hi> in a little time had restored the languishing
Common-wealth, without disobliging any of the Senators, unless where
his Office forced him to it: but though the banished men from all parts
gathered themselves about <hi>Caesar,</hi> giving him counsel to have a care of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s
Law, of which he was the principal object; he seemed not to believe
any thing of it, and comforting them in their misfortunes, still spoke of
<hi>Pompey</hi> with applause. However, he obliged the Tribunes to pass an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
by which he had leave to make a demand of the Consulate the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time, though absent, the which was granted him by the consent of
<hi>Pompey</hi> himself yet Consul. But doubting the Senate owed him no good
will, and fearing if he descended to the condition of a private man, his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
would treat him but ill, he contrived all ways possible, that he might
not quit his Army till he was designed Consul; wherefore he demanded of
the Senate the continuation of his Commission for some time, at least in the
hither <hi>Gaul,</hi> if he could not obtain it in both. <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who succeeded
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65196:170"/>
                  <hi>Pompey,</hi> opposed it; whereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> told him that brought him the news,
<hi>This here shall gain it:</hi> clapping his hand on the Hilt of his Sword. He
had formerly founded the new <hi>Coma</hi> under the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and given to the City
the Privileges of the Latine Cities, that is to say, whoever had been Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
a whole year together was by right a Freeman of <hi>Rome,</hi> which
gave another occasion to <hi>Marcellus</hi> to shew his spite; for finding at <hi>Rome</hi>
an Inhabitant of <hi>Coma,</hi> who the year before had exercised the Magistracy,
and was therefore reputed a Citizen of <hi>Rome;</hi> to affront <hi>Caesar,</hi> he caused
him to be beaten with Rods (a punishment they never make a Roman Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
suffer, what ever his crime be) and treating him as a Stranger, bid
him go find out <hi>Caesar</hi> and shew him the print of his stripes. So arrogant
was this man; nay, so far did malice transport him, that he would have
sent Successors to <hi>Caesar</hi> before the time of his Commission was expired;
but <hi>Pompey,</hi> whether he thought it dishonourable for him to suffer it, or
that he seemed to be <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Friend, would not let that brave man who had
so well served his Country receive an affront for so short a time. Besides,
none doubted but at the time limited he must return to the condition of
private persons; wherefore they designed Consuls for the approaching
year <hi>Emilius Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Clodius Marcellus</hi> Nephew to that <hi>Marcellus</hi> we
were speaking of. And the Dignity of the Tribune of the People was
given to <hi>Curio</hi> a man in favour with the multitude, and withal very eloquent.
These were three declared Enemies to <hi>Caesar,</hi> of whom <hi>Clodius</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be drawn to his Party what ever money he offered him; <hi>Paulus</hi> by
means of<note n="*" place="margin">About two hundred and twenty thousand Pounds.</note> fifteen hundred Talents was wrought upon so as not to be against
him; and <hi>Curio,</hi> who was almost ruined with his debts, gave himself
wholly up to him for somewhat a greater sum. <hi>Paulus</hi> with his money
built a most magnificent Palace, which is still to be seen, called by his own
name, and is one of the most beautiful Works of the City. <hi>Curio,</hi> that
he might not appear to pass all of a sudden to the contrary Party, proposed
a Law for the reparation of the High-ways, of which he demanded a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
for five years, he had no thoughts of gaining it, but only sought an
occasion of Rupture with those of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Party, who he knew would not
fail to oppose it; in which he was not deceived.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Clodius</hi> then spoke of sending Successors to <hi>Caesar,</hi> because the time of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/>
Commission was past; whereupon <hi>Paulus</hi> kept silence: <hi>Curio,</hi> who seemed
concerned for neither Party, applauded <hi>Cladius</hi>'s motions; but he added,
that <hi>Pompey</hi> ought likewise to quit his Provinces, and dismiss his Armies,
and thus the Common-wealth delivered from all fear, would be in perfect
liberty. And when several alledged that not to be just, <hi>Pompey</hi>'s time not
being expired, <hi>Curio</hi> began to cry out aloud, and proclaim to all, that they
ought not to send Successors to <hi>Caesar,</hi> if <hi>Pompey</hi> did not likewise quit his
Governments, and that they being one jealous of another, the City would
never be in peace, but by taking the command from both. He said all
these things because he knew <hi>Pompey</hi> would keep his Provinces and his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
and perceived well that the people had an aversion for him, because
of the Law he had made against Largesses and Bribes; wherefore the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who thought this opinion generous, highly praised <hi>Curio,</hi> who only for
the defence of the publick liberty, did not stick to oppose himself to the
hatred of both of them; so that sometimes they brought him to his House
with universal applauses, strewing Flowers in his way as he passed, who
like a couragious Wrestler durst engage in a Combat so hard and adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
for nothing was accounted more daring than to oppose <hi>Pompey:</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:65196:171"/>
yet at this time he was not in the City, being sick and gone to take the
Country Air, from whence he wrote to the Senate: his Letter began with
praising <hi>Caesar</hi> for his noble Actions; then he proceeded to amplifie what
he had done himself, and that the third Consulate being offered him, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Provinces and Armies, he had not accepted of all these things,
only to settle a better order in the Common-wealth: <hi>But,</hi> said he, <hi>what I
have accepted almost against my will, I will willingly resign to those that would
resume them, without expecting till the time limited by the Command be
past.</hi> This Letter was writ with much artifice to perswade all the world of
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s integrity, and make <hi>Caesar</hi> at the same time odious, who even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the time of his power expired<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would not lay down Arms. Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the City, he talked after the same manner, nay, promising at
present to depose himself, and saying, that <hi>Caesar</hi> his Friend and Ally would
not think it hard to do the like; and that it was easie to believe, that after
long and laborious Wars against the most warlike people of the world, and
having so far extended the Dominion of his Country, he would be content
to pass the rest of his life in Honours, in Sacrifices, and in Repose, of which
he stood in need. He said not all this but with design to hasten the sending
Successors to <hi>Caesar,</hi> whilst he contented himself to promise. But <hi>Curio</hi>
discovering his cunning, told him, it was not enough to make promises
if they were not presently executed, that <hi>Caesar</hi> ought not to disarm unless
he disarmed also; and that it was neither advantageous for him to foment
private enmities By this authority; nor for the Common-wealth, that so
great power should be in one man's hands; whereas being divided between
two, one would curb the pride of the other, if he attempted any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Senate and People of <hi>Rome.</hi> He pursued his Discourse, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
against <hi>Pompey,</hi> saying, that he aimed at Sowereign Power, and if
the fear of <hi>Caesar</hi> could not keep him within bounds of Duty, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be kept in; and therefore it was his advice, that if they would not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the authority of the Senate, they should declare them both Enemies,
and raise Forces to make War upon them. <hi>Curio</hi> deceived all the world
by uttering this his judgment, and quite cancelled the opinion, that ever
he had been corrupted by <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Gift; but <hi>Pompey</hi> grew angry, and after
having severely threatened him, retired in discontent to a House he had in
the Suburbs, that the Senate began to enter into distrust both of the one
and the other. However, they esteemed <hi>Pompey</hi> more affectionate to the
publick good; for they had not yet forgot the odious Consulate of <hi>Caesar.</hi>
There were likewise some who seriously believed, that the City could not
be secure if <hi>Pompey</hi> first dismissed his Forces, because his Rival puffed up
with the success of his Arms was abroad extremely powerful. <hi>Curia</hi>
thwarted that opinion, by saying, that on the contrary they had need of
<hi>Caesar</hi> to reduce the other. But seeing they could not follow his advice, he
dismissed the Senate without any thing resolved on; for the Tribunes of the
People have power to do it, which gave cause to <hi>Pompey</hi> to repent his having
re-established the authority of the Tribunes which <hi>Sylla</hi> had almost utterly
qualified. Yet it was agreed in the Senate befor they parted, that <hi>Pompey</hi>
and <hi>Caesar</hi> should each send a Legin into <hi>Syria,</hi> to defend that Province,
which might be invaded after the loss sustained in <hi>Parthia.</hi> That being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
on, <hi>Pompey,</hi> pursuing his old cunning, sent to redemand of <hi>Caesar</hi> a
Legion he had lent him when <hi>Triturins</hi> and <hi>Cotta</hi> his Lieutenants were
defeated; whereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> gave every Soldier<note n="*" place="margin">Twen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Drachms, and sent them to the City with another of his own; but because
danger appeared towards <hi>Syria,</hi> they passed their Winter Quarters at <hi>Capua.</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:65196:171"/>
Those that led them sowed a great many ill reports of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and assured
<hi>Pompey,</hi> that <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Army tired with long labour, and willing to see their
Country, would without any difficulty submit themselves to him so soon as
he should pass the <hi>Alpes;</hi> which they either said to deceive <hi>Pompey,</hi> or out
of ignorance; for <hi>Caesar</hi> had none but good and faithful Soldiers, whether
it were that being accustomed to War they loved it, or that led by interest,
they were fixed to him, by those profits which ordinarily attend Victories,
together with the liberality of their General. Indeed he gave profusely to
them to prepare them to the execution of his Designs, of which they were
not ignorant, nor therefore became they less affectionate to him; but <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
giving credit to the reports brought him, neither made any Levies of
Men, nor any other preparations capable to sustain so great a War. To
proceed, when they next in Senate debated this Affair, and that the Fathers
spoke their opinion one after the other, the Consul by a wile having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them apart if they were of the opinion to take away <hi>Pompey</hi>'s
Command, many were of a contrary mind, and after asking if they thought
it convenient to send a Successor to <hi>Caesar,</hi> they all agreed to it: But <hi>Curio</hi>
then asking anew if they would not that both should dismiss their Forces,
there was but two and twenty contradicted it; and three hundred and seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
all affectionate to the publick good, followed <hi>Curio</hi>'s judgment: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Consul dismissing the Assembly, cryed out, <hi>Well then, take</hi> Caesar
<hi>for your Master.</hi> Soon after a false rumour coming that <hi>Caesar</hi> had passed
the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and was marching directly to the City, all the World was
allarm'd, and the Consuls proposed to the Senate to send for the Legions
were at <hi>Capua,</hi> to employ against him as an Enemy of the State. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Curio</hi> saying that the news was false, the Consul grew angry, and said,
<hi>Since in consulting of Affairs with all the Senate, I am hindred from provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for the safety of the Common-welth, I will provide alone according to the
power which I have.</hi> After which, going out of the City with his Colleague,
and presenting a Sword to <hi>Pompey: We order you,</hi> said he, <hi>my Colleague and
I to march against</hi> Caesar, <hi>and fight for your Country, and to that purpose we
give you that Army is at</hi> Capua, <hi>or in any other place of</hi> Italy <hi>with power to
raise Forces at your discretion.</hi> He declared he would obey them, because it
was their command, but adding withal these words, <hi>If no better Expedient
can be found.</hi> Which he did craftily to perswade them of the sincerity of
his intentions.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Curio</hi> had no farther power in the Administration of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/>
a Tribune not being permitted to go out of the circuit of the
Walls, yet he deplored in all Assemblies of the People the present state of
Affairs, and was so bold as to demand is full Senate, that all People should
be forbid enrolling themselves in the Forces levyed by <hi>Pompey:</hi> but seeing
he laboured in vain, and lost all hopes of being able to serve his Friend, the
time of his Tribuneship being almost past, and likewise growing fearful for
himself, he departed on a sudden to go and find out <hi>Caesar,</hi> who being lately
returned from <hi>England,</hi> had crossed that<note n="*" place="margin">France<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Gaul</hi> which is bounded by the
<hi>Rhine,</hi> and passed the <hi>Alpes</hi> with five thousand Foot and three hundred
Horse: He met him on the way to <hi>Revenna,</hi> which is the Frontier of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and the last Town of his Government, where he received <hi>Curio</hi> with
all possible testimonies of good will; and after having thanked him for the
services he had done him, desired his counsel in what he had to do. <hi>Curio</hi>
advised him to send as speedily as he could for his Forces, and lead them to
the City; but <hi>Caesar</hi> chose rather first to try some way of Accommodation,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65196:172"/>
wherefore he writ to his Friends that they should endeavour to obtain of
the Senate, that he might only keep two Legions with the Government of
the hither <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Illyria,</hi> till such time as he was named Consul, and that
he would deliver up, to whoever they should send for Successor, all the rest
of the Province, and all the remainder of his Forces. <hi>Pompey</hi> was content
with the proposition; but because the Consuls opposed it, <hi>Caesar</hi> writ to the
Senate a Letter, which <hi>Curio,</hi> having rode<note n="*" place="margin">About four hundred and ten Miles.</note> three thousand and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Furlongs in three days, gave to the new Consuls as they entred the
Palace the first day of the year. In the beginning he spoke in advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
terms of the great things that he had done; then he protested that
he was ready to quit his command, so <hi>Pompey</hi> would do this same, but if
<hi>Pompey</hi> kept it, he would keep it too, and should suddenly be in the City to
revenge the outrages done as well to him as to his Country. When they
heard these last words, they all cryed out that he declared War by this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and immediately nominated for his Successor <hi>L. Domitius,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
soon after with four thousand Men new levied: and because <hi>Anthony</hi>
and <hi>Cassius,</hi> Tribunes of the People, were of <hi>Curio</hi>'s mind, the Senate grew
so much the hotter against him, and giving <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Army the name of the
Army of the Common-wealth, declared that of <hi>Caesar</hi> Enemy to their
Country. And at last <hi>Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Lentulus</hi> Consuls ordered those Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
to go out of the Senate, for fear lest without having regard to their
Dignity, though sacred, they should be evilly treated. Then <hi>Anthony</hi>
leaping from his Seat in Choler, invoked with great cries the faith of men
and God, and lamented that an authority which had hitherto been held
sacred was no longer in security, and that they shamefully drove from the
Senate those who proposed saving advice, as if they had been guilty of
Murder, or some other crime. Afte having said these words, he departed
in a fury, foretelling, as if he had been a Divine, the Wars, Proscriptions,
Banishments and Confiscations wherewith the City was threatened, and
making horrible imprecations against those who were the cause of all their
miseries. <hi>Curio</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> withdrew likewise with him (for <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
were already come to environ the Palace) and they departed all three
together in the Habit of Slaves upon hired Horses, and so got to <hi>Caesar.</hi> He
shewed them in the condition they were to his Soldiers, to enrage them the
more, telling them, that after all their great services they were declared
Enemies to their Country, and that those great men had been shamefully

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> The War being thus declared on both sides, the Senate, who believed
that the Army out of <hi>Gaul</hi> could not come in a long time to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and that
with so few Forces as he had he would not take the Field, gave order to
<hi>Pompey</hi> to send for out of <hi>Thessaly</hi> thirteen thousand Men that were of the
old Soldiers, and to enrol men in pay of the most warlike Nations circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the War; and in case the publick money should fail, there were
several private men would advance it, till such time as it could be levyed
upon the Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> which they laboured to do with much haste and
rigour. For <hi>Caesar</hi>'s part he had sent people to bring his Army, but being
accustomed to succeed more by diligence, striking a terrour and hardiness,
than any mighty preparations, he resolved to begin this great War with his
five thousand Men, and seise of some places of <hi>Italy,</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
for him: first he sent before to <hi>Rimini</hi> some Centurions and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65196:172"/>
Men who were to enter the City as Passengers, and then all of a sudden to
seise on that City (the first that offers it self coming from <hi>Gaul</hi>) and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the Evening going out as if he had found himself ill after a Feast,
leaves his Friends, and mounting in a Chariot drove himself the same way,
followed at a distance by his Cavalry; when he came to the Banks of <hi>Rubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
he stopped some time, looking upon the water, and thinking of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities
he went about to be the cause of, if he passed that River in Arms.
At length turning to those of his Train; <hi>My Friends,</hi> said he, <hi>if I pass not
this River immediately, it will be to me the beginning of all misfortunes; and
if I do pass it, I go to make a world of people miserable:</hi> and therewithal as if
he had been pressed forward by some Divinity, he drave into the stream,
and crossing it, cries with a loud voice; <hi>The Lot is cast.</hi> From whence
continuing on his way with speed, he seised on <hi>Rimini</hi> by break of day,
and all in an instant places Garrisons in all the good places of that Country,
which he reduced either by force or favour. Mean while, as it happens in
these unexpected Allarms, the whole Country was filled with people flying,
the Countrymen forsaking their Habitations, and nothing was to be heard
but Cries, and Lamentations, and Groans, yet no man knew from whence
this disorder came, but all imagined that <hi>Caesar</hi> was upon them with all his
Forces. The Consuls receiving the news, gave not <hi>Pompey,</hi> who perfectly
understood War, leisure to prepare himself, and take his own time, they
began to press him to be gone out of the City, and make Levies of Forces
in <hi>Italy,</hi> as if <hi>Rome</hi> had been in immediate danger of being taken and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.
And the Senate surprised with so unlooked for an irruption, were
terrified, and began to repent they had not accepted those reasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
offered by <hi>Caesar;</hi> but this was not, till fear had opened their eyes,
and led them back from Partiality to Reason; for now men talked of a
great many Prodigies and extraordinary Signs which had appeared in the
Heavens, that it had rained Blood in many places, that in others the Statues
of the Gods had sweat, that many Temples had been struck with Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts,
that a Mule had engendred, besides an infinite of other things
which seemed to foretel the change of the present state, and the ruine of
the Common-wealth, so as it should never be re-established; wherefore
they made Vows and Prayers as in a publick Consternation. And the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
remembring again the miseries they had suffered because of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions of <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> cryed out, that they ought to take away the
Command as well from <hi>Caesar</hi> as from <hi>Pompey,</hi> since that was the only
means to prevent a War: <hi>Cicero</hi> himself was of opinion that Deputies
should be sent to <hi>Caesar</hi> to treat an Accommodation, but the Consuls abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
opposed it. <hi>Favonius</hi> quipping at <hi>Pompey</hi> because of a word he had
once said with too much arrogance, <hi>Bid him stamp on the ground with his
Foot, and see if any armed Men would rise.</hi> To which <hi>Pompey</hi> answered,
<hi>You will want none so you will follow me, and are not troubled to leave the City,
and</hi> Italy <hi>it self if there be occasion: for people of courage,</hi> said he, <hi>do not
make liberty consist in the possession of Lands and Houses, they cannot want in any
place they come to; and if they lose not their courage, will soon recover their
Houses and Lands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After having said these words, and protested he would hold him for an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/>
Enemy, that out of fear to lose what he possessed, deserted the Common-wealth
in extreme danger, he went out of the Palace, and soon after out of
the City, to joyn the Army that was at <hi>Capua.</hi> The Consuls followed him
presently, but the other Senators weighted it a little longer, and spent all the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65196:173"/>
night in the Palace, without resolving any thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at length as soon as
it was break of day the greater part followed the same way after <hi>Pompey.</hi>
Mean time, <hi>Caesar</hi> having reached at <hi>Corfinium L. Domitius,</hi> whom they
had sent for his Successor with four thousand Men; of which he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
lost a part, he besieged him in the City, from whence endeavouring to
escape, the Inhabitants stopped him at the Gate, and brought him to <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
to whom the Remainder of his Forces yielded themselves; he received
them kindly, that he might draw others by their example, and without
doing any wrong to <hi>Domitius,</hi> he suffered him to go whither he pleased,
with all his Equipage, hoping by this courtesie to oblige him to take his
Party, yet without hindring him from going to find out <hi>Pompey.</hi> These
things being done in such an instant, <hi>Pompey</hi> on the other side marches from
<hi>Capua</hi> to <hi>Nucera,</hi> and from <hi>Nucera</hi> to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> that he might from
thence pass to <hi>Epire,</hi> where he designed to establish the Seat of the War,
he writ to all Provinces, and those that commanded them, to Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
to Sovereigns, and particular Cities, that with all convenient
speed they should send him what Forces they could supply him with, in
which every one laboured with all his power. He had his own particular
Army in <hi>Spain,</hi> ready to march at his first command, and for those Legions
he had with him he gave one part of them to the Consuls, whom he sent
before into <hi>Epire,</hi> they embarquing at the same time at <hi>Brundusium,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
crossed the Gulf, and landed at <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> which some by mistake
think to be <hi>Epidamnum;</hi> for <hi>Epidamnus</hi> King of the Barbarians, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
those Countries, built near the Sea the City to which he gave his
own name; and <hi>Dyrrachus</hi> his Grand-son by his Daughter, whom they said
was begot by <hi>Neptune,</hi> added to this City a Port which they call <hi>Dyrrachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi>
This <hi>Dyrrachus</hi> being in War with his Brother <hi>Hercules,</hi> returning
from <hi>Erythrea,</hi> assisted him on condition to have a part of the Country for
his reward. Hence comes it that the Dyrrachians call him their Founder,
as having part in the Lands which they possessed, not that they disavow
<hi>Dyrrachus,</hi> but they are well pleased out of vanity to derive their original
from a God, rather than a Man. 'Tis reported, that in the Fight <hi>Hercules</hi>
ignorantly slew <hi>Ionius</hi> the Son of <hi>Dyrrachus,</hi> and after having payed him all
Funeral Honours, threw the Body into the Sea, which from him was called
<hi>Ionian.</hi> Some Phrygians having deserted their Country, seised afterwards
on this, and on the City it self, where they remained a long time, till after
them the like was done by the Taulantieni, who are a people of <hi>Illyria;</hi>
and again by the Liburnians another Nation of <hi>Illyria</hi> who used to rob their
Neighbours in very swift Brigantines, which the Romans after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
making use of, called Liburnicks. The Dyrrachians chased away
by the Liburnians, having called to their assistance the Corcyrians, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
by Sea, drove out again the Liburnians, and received into their City
part of the Inhabitants of <hi>Corcyra,</hi> to whom in all likelyhood they gave ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
in the Port; and because the name of <hi>Dyrrachium</hi> was thought a
name of ill Augury, they called it <hi>Epidammun,</hi> after the name of the City
which stands at a good distance from the Sea: and so <hi>Thucydides</hi> calls it,
though to this day the old name carries it, and it be called<note n="*" place="margin">Durazzo.</note> 
                  <hi>Dyrrachium<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
The Consuls were already arrived, when <hi>Pompey</hi> led the rest of his Forces
to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> expecting the return of the Fleet to transport them; and
<hi>Caesar</hi> coming thither to besiege him, he hindred his forming a Siege till such
time as the Fleet arriving in the Evening, he embarqued, leaving only to
defend the Walls a party of his best Soldiers, who mounting the same night
on those Ships he had left for them; and having the Wind favourable, soon

to <hi>Epire</hi> with their General.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> hereupon found himself at a stand, he knew not on which side to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/>
turn himself, or where he should to his most advantage begin the War.
He saw that from all parts Forces came to <hi>Pompey,</hi> and he was fearful lest

if he went to pursue those that seem'd to fly from him. In the end he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to march first of all for <hi>Spain,</hi> and having drawn off five Bodies of
Armies, left one at <hi>Brundasium,</hi> another at<note n="*" place="margin">Otranto.</note>

<hi>Sardinia,</hi> because it was fruitful in Corn; and <hi>Asinius Pollia</hi> went by his,
orders with another into <hi>Sicily,</hi> where <hi>Cata</hi> commanded. At his first
coming <hi>Cato</hi> asking him if it were by Decree of the Senate, or Ordinance
of the People, that he thus entred armed into a Province of which another
was Governour, he made him only this short answer; <hi>He that is now Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of</hi> Italy <hi>sent me hither.</hi> To which <hi>Cato</hi> having replyed, That for the
good of the Province he forbore to revenge the affront till another time,
embarqued himself for <hi>Corcyra,</hi> to go and seek out <hi>Pompey.</hi> As for <hi>Caesar</hi>
himself having drawn off some Forces towards the City, he came thither,
and finding the people affrighted with the miseries they had undergone in
<hi>Sylla</hi>'s time, he reassured them, exhorting them to have better hopes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them fair promises, and justifying his clemency to his Enemies by the
example of <hi>Domitius,</hi> who being fallen under his power, he had sent away
with all his Equipage, not doing him the least displeasure. After which
he broke open the Treasury, and notwithstanding the opposition made by
<hi>Metellus</hi> Tribune of the People, whom he threatened to kill if he gave not
over, carried away that Treasure which no man till then durst touch. Some
say it was put there during the invasion of the Gauls, with publick execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
on whoever durst be so bold as to touch it, unless it were to make War
upon the same Gauls: but <hi>Caesar</hi> said he delivered the Common-wealth

of the City, and to <hi>Marc. Anthony</hi> the Command of all the Forces of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>

of the River <hi>Segre,</hi> the River swelling on a sudden with the Winter Rains,
broke down the Bridges, so that those who were gone to guard the
Carriages that were to come to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Camp, not being able to repass the
River by reason of this accident, were all cut in pieces by <hi>Petreius</hi>'s Men;
and <hi>Caesar</hi> himself with the rest of the Army were hardly put to it, to pass
over the rest of their Winter, being to fight against Famine, ill Weather,

Passages. One Evening part of their Army being advanced with design to
chuse a place proper to encamp in, found themselves invested; so that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no way to escape the Soldiers, by lifting up their Bucklers made a sign
that they yielded. But <hi>Caesar,</hi> to gain his Enemies by clemency, sent them
to <hi>Afranius,</hi> without stopping one, or suffering a Dart to be thrown at
them, which occasioned that there was continual entercourse between the
two Camps, and in common discourse the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for already were <hi>Afranius</hi> and many of the Officers of opinion,
that they should quit <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Caesar,</hi> so he would grant them a safe retreat
to <hi>Pompey,</hi> when <hi>Petreius</hi> running through the Army began to cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this proposition, and to kill with his own hand all such of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Party as he found in his Camp, and this in so great madness, that he
run his Sword into the Body of one of his own Tribunes who would have
stopped him in this fury; whereby the Soldiers enraged at this cruelty did
but the more esteem the clemency of <hi>Caesar.</hi> It happened by chance that
he cut off their way to go to water, which put <hi>Petreius</hi> and <hi>Afranius</hi> into a
necessity of demanding a Conference between the two Armies. It was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
that they should quit <hi>Spain,</hi> on condition that he would conduct them
to the River <hi>Var,</hi> and from thence would permit them to retreat to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey.</hi>
When they were arrived at the Banks of that River, he caused all the

to them in this manner:</p>

assisted by <hi>Iuba</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania</hi> in favour of their amity and alliance:
<hi>Curio</hi> had a design to go make War upon him, and passed out of <hi>Sicily</hi> with
two of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Legions upon twelve long Ships, and some other Ships of
Burthen: being landed at <hi>Utica</hi> he put to flight some Numidians in a small
Engagement of Horse; and thereupon suffered his Army drawn up in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia
to proclaim him Emperour. This was an Honour which formerly
Soldiers gave to their Generals as a Testimony of their Valour, and which
the Generals accepted after having done some exploit in War: but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
as far as I can understand, this acclamation is made to none but who
had slain ten thousand of their Enemies. But to proceed, whilst <hi>Curio</hi> was yet
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65196:174"/>
upon the Sea, the Africans imaginining that he would come and post him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in that place which is called the Camp of <hi>Scipio,</hi> as pretending to the
same Glory which that General had gained in <hi>Africa,</hi> poisoned all the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
thereabouts; and in effect they were not deceived, for <hi>Curio</hi> coming to
encamp there, a Sickness spread through his Army. As soon as the Soldiers
had drunk of the water, their sight grew dim, then they were seised with a
great drowsiness, which was followed by vomiting, and at last by Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
wherefore he transported his Camp near to <hi>Utica</hi> with great labour,
making his sick Army march over Marishes of so great extent. But when
he heard of <hi>Caesar's</hi> Victories in <hi>Spain,</hi> he took heart, and engaged the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in a very strait place, where after a fierce Encounter the Enemy had
six hundred killed, besides many more wounded, and <hi>Curio</hi> lost only one
Man. Mean while, as <hi>Iuba</hi> came on with his Forces, false intelligence was
brought to <hi>Curio,</hi> that the King was returned from the River <hi>Bagrada,</hi>
which was not far off, to repulse his Neighbours, who had made an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
into his Kingdom, and had only left <hi>Saburra</hi> with some few Forces:
<hi>Curio</hi> believed it, and in the greatest heats of Summer, and about three
hours in the day made his Army march towards <hi>Saburra,</hi> through ways full
of Sand and Dirt, and no Water; for all Streams were dryed up by the
heat of the Summer; and the King himself with <hi>Saburra</hi> were seised of the
River; whereupon <hi>Curio</hi> fallen from his hopes, made a swift retreat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Mountains, equally incommoded with heat, thirst and weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
The Enemies having observed it, passed the River, and drew up
their Army in Battalia, and he was so imprudent as to come down into the
Plain with his Forces, tyred as they were, and bring them to fight. The
Numidian Horse having invested him, he sustained them for some time, by
giving ground, yet keeping his Battalions close, but seeing the Enemy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
their charge, he once more regained the Mountains: <hi>Pollio</hi> fled
in a good hour to the Camp near <hi>Utica,</hi> for fear lest <hi>Varus</hi> taking the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
should make some disorder; and <hi>Curio</hi> again rashly renewing the
Fight was killed, and all those with him; so that after <hi>Pollio</hi> not one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Utica.</hi> After this ill success of <hi>Curio</hi>'s rashness near <hi>Bagrada,</hi> the
Enemies cut off his Head, which they carried to King <hi>Iuba:</hi> and when the
news was brought to the Army which he had left near <hi>Utica, Flamma</hi> who
commanded the Ships got off to Sea with his Fleet before any of the Land
Soldiers could embarque; so that <hi>Pollio</hi> was forced to get into a Boat to go
and entreat some Merchants which were about to enter the Port of <hi>Utica,</hi>
to bring their Ships close to shore without the City, and take in his Soldiers.
His prayers were so urgent, that some of them in the night came near the
Beach, but the Soldiers thronged so fast into them, that some of them sunk
to the bottom, and those who got out to Sea were thrown over-board by
the Mariners for the Money they had about them. Those who stayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
at <hi>Utica</hi> fared not a whit better; for next morning yielding themselves
to <hi>Varus, Iuba</hi> coming thither, made them all be set upon the Walls, and
saying they were part of his Spoils, caused them to be slain with Darts, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all the entreaties of <hi>Varus</hi> to save their lives. Thus two Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Legions going into <hi>Africa</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Curio</hi> perished with all
their Horse, light armed Foot and Baggage: and <hi>Iuba</hi> thinking he had done
<hi>Pompey</hi> a great piece of service returned into his Kingdom.</p>
               <p>About the same time <hi>Anthony</hi> was defeated by <hi>Dolobella</hi> one of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/>

               <p>At these words all the Legion began to weep, and the Tribunes threw
themselves on their Knees to beg their pardon. At last <hi>Caesar</hi> after some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyals
suffered himself to be overcome, and pardoned the whole Legion,
save only six and twenty Soldiers, who appeared to be the Ring-leaders of
the Mutiny, of whom yet he put only twelve to death, to whom the Dice
proved unlucky; and it being made evident, that one of these twelve was
absent at the time of the Mutiny, <hi>Caesar</hi> in his stead condemned to death the
Centurion who had impeached him. The Mutiny of <hi>Placentia</hi> thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased,
he returned to the City, which he struck with a general fear; and
without staying for a Sessions of the Senate, or the suffrage of any one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
created himself Dictator; but either thinking this supreme De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Honour might expose him to envy, or possibly judging it superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
eleven days after (as some say) he designed himself Consul with
<hi>Servilius Isauricus,</hi> and made Govenours of Provinces, or changed those
already in Command as he pleased. To <hi>M. Lepidus</hi> he gave <hi>Spain;</hi> to <hi>A.
Albinius Sicily;</hi> to <hi>Sextus Peducaeus Sardinia;</hi> and to <hi>Decimus Brutus</hi> the
new Province of <hi>Gaul.</hi> He likewise distributed Corn to the People, then
much straitened with Famine; and at the request of the same people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the return of the Exiles, except only of <hi>Milo.</hi> But when they
demanded a Release of their Debts, into which they had been forced to
run by reason of the Wars and Tumults, it being impossible for them to
pay, because the inheritances they might otherwise sell to clear themselves
were now valued at nothing, he absolutely refused it; yet he created Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
to put a value on things to be sold, and ordered that the Creditors
should take them as ready Money, and in part of so much of their Debts
as they should be valued at. That done, about the depth of Winter he
sent Commissaries of War to all his Armies, to bring them to the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous
he had appointed at <hi>Brundusium;</hi> and departed from a City in
the Month of <hi>December,</hi> without staying for the first day of the next year,
as his Quality of Conful obliged him. The people went out in great crowds
to attend him, both to pay him that Honour, and to beg of him to make a
reconciliation with <hi>Pompey</hi> (for it was mre than likely that which soever
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65196:175"/>
of the two got the Victory would become Master of the Common-wealth)
and he by great journies went on towards <hi>Brundusium.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> on the other side without any intermission caused Ships to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/>
built, Forces to be raised, Money to be gathered in; and having taken for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Ships in the<note n="*" place="margin">Ionian.</note> Superiour Sea, waited for his passing over.
Mean while he continually employed his Soldiers in some exercise, where
himself was still present, and in person began any work even beyond what his
age seemed to give leave to, which gained him all Mens Hearts, who throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in from all parts as to some Spectacle to see his Exercises. <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Forces
were composed of ten Legions: and for <hi>Pompey,</hi> he had five Legions which
went over out of <hi>Italy</hi> with their Horse, two of which remained of <hi>Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>'s
Forces which he had led against the Parthians, and some part of those
who went into <hi>Egypt</hi> under <hi>Gabinius,</hi> all amounting to eleven Legions of
Italians, and about seven thousand Horse, besides the Auxiliary Troops of
<hi>Ionia, Macedon, Peloponnesus, Boeotia,</hi> the Archers of <hi>Crete,</hi> and the
Slingers of <hi>Thrace;</hi> he had likewise some Gaul and Galatian Horse, and
Comagenians sent him by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> Cilicians, Cappadocians, and some
Soldiers of <hi>Armenia</hi> the less, <hi>Pamphylia,</hi> and <hi>Pisidia.</hi> He designed not to
make use of all these Strangers to bear Arms, but destined the greatest part
of them to labour in the Trenches and other Works, wherein he would not
employ the Italians, that he might not divert them from the Exercise of
Arms. These were his Land Forces; for the Sea he had six hundred long
Ships fitted and armed for War, a hundred of which besides Seamen were
filled with Roman Soldiers, on whom was the chiefest relyance, besides a
great many Ships of Burthen which carried his Ammunition and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
the Command of all this Fleet was committed to several Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals,
over all whom <hi>M. Bibulus</hi> was Admiral. Things thus prepared,
he caused all the Senators and Knights he had with him to assemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and at the Head of his Army thus spake to them:</p>

                           <p>THe Athenians (Gentlemen) formerly deserted the Walls of their City,
when they fought in the defence of their Liberty, because they thought
the Men composed the City, and not the Buildings, by which means they soon
recovered them, and in a short time after built them much more beautiful than
before. Our Predecessors likewise went out of <hi>Rome,</hi> when the Gauls like a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
invaded them, and <hi>Camillus</hi> returning with them from <hi>Ardea,</hi> regained
it in the same condition they had left it. In a word, those that are wise think
their Country every where, where they can preserve their liberty. These exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and the hopes of a like success have obliged us to come hither, not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
our Country, but the better to prepare our selves to defend it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
it's cause upon him, who having a long time designed to oppress it, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Master of it by their means whom he hath with gifts corrupted. He, I say, who
being by you declared Enemy to the Common-wealth, hath by his audacious Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises
invaded the authority of the Senate and Roman People, and given the
government of your Provinces to those of his Faction, to some that of the City,

forbear to exercise towards his Country, if we be so unhappy to let our selves be

overcome. He, who commits such insolencies in the beginning of a War where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he fears the event, and whilst he is liable to receive the punishment of his
Crimes, which is what we ought to wish and hope to see by the Divine Assistance;
for he hath in his Party none but Wretches corrupted by the Money he hath drawn
out of our Province of <hi>Gaul,</hi> who chose rather to be his Slaves than to live e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
with other Citizens: for my part I never was wanting, nor shall not be
wanting to expose my self to all sorts of Dangers; I offer my self to perform
the Function of General or Soldier; and if I yet have the same good fortune
and the same experience which hitherto have made me every where victorious, I
beseech the Gods they may prove advantageous to my Country, and that I may
not be less happy now when the Dispute is whether I shall prevent it's being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
than when I extended the Bounds of its Empire. We have reason to
have confidence in the protection of the Gods, and in the Iustice of our Cause:
for never can any be more just and honest to whoever loves his Country and the
Common-wealth. Besides those great preparations we have made both by Sea
and Land, and the Forces will come in to us from all parts as soon as the War
is begun, is sufficient to encourage us; for all the Levant Nations as far as those
bordering on the Euxine Sea, whether Greeks or Barbarians, are of our side, and
all the Kings of those people who are either the Romans Friends or Allies or
mine, will send us Soldiers, Arms, Provisions, and all things necessary. Let
us go then, and give to our Country the assistance it merits, which your Virtue
exacts from you, and my good Fortune demands from me; but remember al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

                  <hi>Pompey</hi>'s last words were followed by a general acclamation of the whole
Army, Senators and other persons of Quality, who all desired him to lead
them whither he thought fit. But he considering that it was the very worst
season of the year; and besides, imagining that <hi>Caesar</hi> impeded in the City
the creation of Consuls, would not attempt to cross a Sea usually tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
before the end of Winter, gave order to those commanded the Sea

Victory. Let us go then and make our selves Masters of their Munitions, of
their Provisions, of their Baggage, of their Servants, whilst the cold shuts
them up in their Houses, and <hi>Pompey</hi> thinks I am spending the Winter in the

               <p>All the Soldiers cryed out he should lead them whither he pleased: as
soon as he descended from the place whence he had spoke to them, he caused
five Legions and six hundred chosen Horse to march towards the Sea, who
being embarqued, rode at Anchor, because of a Storm that happened, as
is usual in the Month of <hi>December.</hi> The contrary Winds (do what they
could) stayed them till the first day of the following year, when two Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
more coming to <hi>Caesar,</hi> he caused them to embark on the Ships of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;
for he had left those few long Ships he had for the Guard of <hi>Sicily</hi>
and <hi>Sardinia.</hi> They they set sail all together; and the whole Fleet being
carried by the Storm to the Ceraunian Rocks, there landed them, and went
immediately back to fetch the rest of the Army. <hi>Caesar</hi> with those he had
marched towards <hi>Orica,</hi> but because the ways were rought and narrow he
was often forced to file off; so that had there been any suspicion of his
March, it might easily have been prevented, because of the cragginess of
the ways. At length having about break of day with much labour got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
all his Army, he presented himself before the City, where he that
commanded, by consent of the Inhabitants, who thought it not convenient
to shut the Gates against a Roman Consul, brought him the Keys, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
continued on his Party in the same Quality of Governour of that
place. <hi>Lucretius</hi> and <hi>Minutius</hi> who were on the other side of <hi>Orica</hi> with
eighteen long Ships to guard the Ships of Burthen which carried Corn to
<hi>Pompey,</hi> hearing of this Surrender, sunk the Ships and Corn to the bottom,
and fled to <hi>Dyrrachium.</hi> From <hi>Orica Caesar</hi> hastened to <hi>Apollonia,</hi> where the
Inhabitants having opened the Gates, <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Governour left the
City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> after these fortunate Beginnings, drew together his Forces, and let <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/>
them know how by the means of his diligence and the favour of Fortune he
had surmounted the Difficulties of the Season, crossed a great Extent of Sea,
with Ships, taken <hi>Orica</hi> and <hi>Apollonia</hi> without fighting, and already (as he
had foretold) gained from the Enemy what things they wanted, even before
<hi>Pompey</hi> had knowledge of it. <hi>But if now we can,</hi> said he, <hi>make our selves
Masters of</hi> Dyrrachium, <hi>where</hi> Pompey's <hi>Magazines both of Munition and
Provision are, all that he with so much Cost and Pains has been storing up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will become your Recompence.</hi> Having said these words, he went right
to the City, continuing his March Night and Day by long and difficult
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65196:177"/>
ways. <hi>Pompey</hi> receiving advice hereof, advances from <hi>Macedonia</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
him, causing all along as he passed, trees to be cut down, Bridges
broken, and all Provisions to be burnt, to retard <hi>Caesar</hi>'s March if he should
come that way; for he thought (as indeed it was true) the preserving
of his Stores was of no small importance. The Soldiers of both Armies
were so eager to gain <hi>Dyrrachium</hi> first, that if in any place they saw at a
distance either the dust raised by their Fellows, or Fire, or Smoak, they
presently imagined it was the Enemy, and run as if they had been to run a
race; they gave themselves neither time to eat, nor to sleep, but with
Shouts and Hollas encouraged one another, pressing their companions for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to follow the Guides, which in the night carried Torches before them,
and which sometimes caused great tumults, and as often Allarms as if the
Enemy had been upon them; some quite tired threw away their Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
and others privately withdrawing out of the Body, stopped in the
Valleys to take a little repose which they stood in need of, and preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the fear or danger they might be in of their Enemies. Yet in the end
of this Contention between the two Parties, <hi>Pompey</hi> got first to <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi>
and encamped near the Walls, he sent presently his Fleet to <hi>Orica,</hi> which
returned under his obedience, and after caused the Sea to be guarded with
more diligence than before. <hi>Caesar</hi> pitched his Camp directly against him,
on the other side of the River <hi>Alora,</hi> which parted the two Armies, where
yet there happened some Horse Skirmishes, now one Party and then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
passing the River, but neither would engage with all their Forces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Pompey</hi> thought good first to exercise his Forces that were newly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed,
and <hi>Caesar</hi> expected those that were to come from <hi>Brundusium.</hi> He
thought if they stayed till Spring, and then should come over with Ships
of Burthen (and he had no other) they could no way be secured, <hi>Pompey</hi>
having such a number of Galleys to defend the passage; but if they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued
during Winter, they might slip by their Enemies, who now lay
harboured in the Islands, or if they were engaged, might open themselves
a passage by the violence of the Winds, and the Bulk of their Vessels,
wherefore he did all he could to hasten their coming.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVIII"/> And therefore out of impatience that the rest of his Army came not
from <hi>Brundusium,</hi> he resolved himself to go privately over, thinking they
would sooner follow him than any other; wherefore without discovering
his design to any one, he sent three of his Slaves to a River not above twelve
Furlongs distant, to secure some very light Boat, and a good Pilot, as if
he had an intention to send him upon some design, and feigning himself ill,
rose from Table where he desired his Friends to continue, and taking the
habit of a private man, mounting his Chariot, came to the Boat as <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
Messenger. He had given orders to his Slaves to command the Mariners
what they had to do, whilst he kept himself concealed under coverlids and
the darkness of the night. Though the wind were contrary, and very ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
the Slaves made the Pilot put off, bidding him be of courage, and
make use of his time to escape the Enemy, who were not far from them,
they laboured so hard, that by force of Oars they got the Mouth of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
where the Waves of the Sea beating against the stream of the River,
the Pilot (who on the other side was afraid of falling into the Enemies
hands) did all was possible for man to do, till seeing they gained nothing,
and the Seamen not able to pull any longer he left the Helm. Then the
Consul discovering his Head, cryed out, <hi>Courage, Pilot, fear no storm, for
thou carriest Caesar and his fortune.</hi> Whereupon the Pilot and his crew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65196:177"/>
at these words, redoubling their force passed the Mouth of the
River, got out to Sea; but because the Winds and the Waves still drove
them towards the Lee shore in spite of all their endeavours, and day
approaching, the Mariners fearing to be discovered by the Enemy, <hi>Caesar</hi>
angry at fortune that envyed him, suffered the Pilate to ragain the River,
and the Boat presently running afore the Wind, came to the place from
whence they set out: <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Friends admired at his boldness, others
blamed him for having done an action more proper for a private Soldier
than a General; and he seeing his design had not succeded, and that it was
impossible for him to pass over without being known, sent <hi>Posthumius</hi> in his
place. He first had charge to tell <hi>Gabinius</hi> that he should presently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark
the Army, and bring it to him; and if he refused, then to address
himself to <hi>Anthony,</hi> and at last to <hi>Calenus,</hi> and if none of these three had
spirit enough to execute these orders, he had a Letter for the Army in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
by which the Soldiers were exhorted to come over and follow <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humius,</hi>
landing at any place they could, without regarding the Ships; for
he had more need of Men than Ships, so much confidence had he in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
indeed more than in prudence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> then judging he ought no longer to delay, drew out his Army <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/>
in Battalia, and caused them to advance against <hi>Caesar;</hi> but two of his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
being entred into the River to sound the Ford, and one of <hi>Caesar's</hi> Men
having slain them both, he took this as an ill presage, and led back his
Forces into the Camp, though many lamented the loss of so fair an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
As for the Forces at <hi>Brundusium, Gabinius</hi> refusing to follow the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
brought by <hi>Posthumius,</hi> with all that would follow him, went the way
of <hi>Illyria</hi> by Land, taking such long Marches, that his Men being quite
tired, the Inhabitants of the Country cut them all in pieces, for which
<hi>Caesar</hi> could not yet be revenged, being engaged in affairs of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<hi>Anthony</hi> shipped away the rest, and having the Wind right aft,
passed in sight of <hi>Apollonia</hi> with a merry Gale; but about Noon the Wind
beginning to slacken, they were discovered by twenty of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Galleys<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
who made up towards them, they were fearful lest the Stems of the long
Ships running on board them should pierce through and sink them; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
they were preparing to fight, every Man laying hold of his Sling, his
Javelin, or Arms of the like nature: when on a sudden there sprung up a
fresher gale than the former; so that <hi>Anthony</hi> setting his low Sails, went
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pooning away before, whilst the others not able to bear Sail, were tossed
too and fro, where the Winds and Waves pleased, and at length driven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Narrows, and cast upon Lee shores where there were neither Port
nor Harbour. Thus <hi>Anthony</hi> safely recovered the Port of <hi>Nymphaeum</hi>
without losing more than two Ships, which unfortunately running upon
the Flats were taken by the Enemies. <hi>Caesar</hi> having now with him all his
Forces as well as <hi>Pompey,</hi> they pitched their Camps in sight of each other,
upon eminencies where each entrenched themselves, raising out Forts,
which were often attacqued by one Party and the other, one General still
striving to block up the others Army, and cut them off from Provisions,
so that there happened many Skirmishes. In this new mode of making
War, as <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Men one day proved the weaker in a Fort assailed by the
Enemy, a Centurion called <hi>Sceva,</hi> famous before for many gallant actions,
being wounded in an eye, leaped from the Rampart, and making a sign
with his hand for silence, as if he had something to say, he called to one of
the Centurions of the contrary Party, a Man of Reputation, to whom he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65196:178"/>
said, <hi>Save the life of one of thy own quality, save the life of thy Friend, send
some body to lead me by the hand thus wounded as I am.</hi> Whereupon two Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
stepping in to receive him as a Runaway, he slew one before he su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
the deceit, and knocked the other down. He did this action out of
pure despair he was in of being able to defend the place; but it succeeded
better than he imagined; for this happy success so raised the courage of his
Companions, that they repulsed the Enemy, and remained Masters of the
Fort. <hi>Minutius</hi> who commanded had a great share in the Glory as well as
in the danger of this Assault; for 'tis said his Buckler was six and twenty
times pierced through, and he was wounded in the eye as well as <hi>Sceva;</hi> so
<hi>Caesar</hi> honoured them both with many Military Recompences. Mean time,
he had formed intelligence in <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> and upon hopes the place would
be delivered to him, he came with a small company to the Gate which is
near the Temple of <hi>Diana;</hi> but his design being discovered, came off again
without doing any thing. The same Winter <hi>Scipio,</hi> Father-in-law to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi>
bringing him another Army out of <hi>Syria,</hi> was set upon in <hi>Macedon</hi> by
<hi>C. Calvisius,</hi> whom he defeated, and slew him a whole Legion, fourscore
Soldiers only escaping. There came now no more Provisions to <hi>Caesar</hi> by
Sea, <hi>Pompey</hi> being the stronger, wherefore the Soldiers were forced to
make Bread of a certain kind of Herbs, pieces of which being by some
Runaways brought to <hi>Pompey,</hi> thinking it would be to him a joyful present:
instead of rejoycing at it, <hi>What sort of Beasts,</hi> said he, <hi>have we to deal
with? Caesar</hi> now pinched with necessity drew together his Forces, resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to engage <hi>Pompey</hi> whether he would or no; but <hi>Pompey</hi> being now pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
of several good Forts, kept close in his Trenches, which so much
troubled, <hi>Caesar,</hi> that he undertook a work almost impossible, and scarcely
credible, which was to inclose all the Forts <hi>Pompey</hi> had, with a Trench drawn
from the Sea, judging that though his design took not effect, he should
gain the reputation of a man capable of great things; for this Trench must
have been<note n="*" place="margin">A hundred and fifty Miles long.</note> twelve hundred Furlongs in length. <hi>Pompey</hi> on his part drew
Lines and Trenches directly opposite to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Works: thus one eluded the
Enterprises of the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XX"/> At length there happened a great Fight between them, wherein <hi>Pompey</hi>
bravely repulsing <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Men, and having put them to flight, pursued them
to their very Camp. Many Colours they took, and had taken the Eagle of
a Legion, if the Standard-bearer who carried it had not thrown it with all
his force into the Trenches, that he might preserve it for <hi>Caesar;</hi> for the
Roman Soldiery have a great respect for their Standards: <hi>Caesar</hi> with other
Companies came to the relief of those that fled, but so terrified were these
too, that as soon as they beheld <hi>Pompey</hi> at a distance, though they were near
the Camp, it was not possible for <hi>Caesar</hi> to stop them, nor to make them go
in again, nor so much as to hearken to him, the Soldiers fled away in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
without shame, without reason, or without any thing to oblige them
to it: <hi>Caesar</hi> might well run up and down, and with reproaches shew them,
that <hi>Pompey</hi> was yet a great way off. This hindred them not from throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down their Arms, and flying, or else standing still silent and immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
fixing their eyes upon the ground with shame and confusion, so great
was that panick fear had possesed them. There was an Ensign who, as
his General would have stopped him, presented him the point of his Jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,
but he was upon the spot punished by the Guards as he deserved. Those
who escaped into the Camp were so cast down, that they kept no Guard at
the Gates, nor lined the Rampire, but the Trenches were left without any
to defend them. All men believed that <hi>Pompey</hi> might have thrown himself
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65196:178"/>
into the Camp with the Flyers, and so have made an end of the War, if
<hi>Labienus,</hi> (for God would have it so) had not perswaded him rather to
pursue those he had routed, then march up to the Trenches; him therefore
he believed, whether it were that he was not in such haste as to make an
end of all at once, or that seeing the Camp defenceless, he feared some
Ambuscade, or else being victorious, scorn'd that little advantage. Going
therefore to charge those were still abroad, he made yet a great Slaughter,
so that in two Engagements in one day he gained twenty eight Colours,
and twice lost the opportunity of ruining his Enemy beyond redress. And
<hi>Caesar</hi> himself stuck not to say that that day the War had been ended, had
his Enemy known how to make use of his Victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> after this glorious Success, wrote largely of it to the Kings and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXI"/>
Commonalties; and conceived hopes that in a short time <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Army, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
oppressed by Famine or terrified with this Disgrace, would yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to him; especially the Tribunes, fearful of being punished for a fault
they knew themselves guilty of. But they and all the Soldiers touched with
Repentance as by Divine Inspiration, confessed themselves Criminals; and
afflicted themselves the more, that their General spoke kindly to them, and
granted them Pardon before they asked it: They would not forgive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
but with a wonderful Change, desired, as a Punishment of their
Fault, they might be decimated, according to the custom of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors;
but he would by no means admit it; which encreased their shame
the more, that they should be guilty of such Cowardize in prejudice of the
best Man of the World, and who most deserved their Faith and their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.
They besought him that at least he would punish the Ensigns, who
had been the Cause of this Rout; for in flying they had only followed their
Colours: and seeing <hi>Caesar</hi> could not resolve to do that, but with much ado
would consent to the Punishment of a few, his Moderation begot in the
minds of the Soldiers a General Joy. They began all with one voice to cry
out that he should lead them against the Enemy, that by gaining a new Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
they might wipe away their Infamy; and in the sight of their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
they swore by whole Companies one to the other, never to return from
the Fight but Victorious. Wherefore his Friends advised him to take the
Army at their Words, and make tryal of them upon this height of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
before their Zeal grew cooler: But he answered them before all
the Multitude, that he would chuse a time more proper to shew them the
Enemy; exhorting them then to remember the good Will they now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested:
and in private he told his Confidents, that it was convenient to let
that fear, which so late a loss had imprinted, be worn a little out of the
minds of the Soldiery; and by temporizing, let the fierceness of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
heightned by their late Victory, be likewise a little cooled. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
withal he had committed a great fault in coming to encamp so near
<hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> where <hi>Pompey</hi> had all things in abundance; whereas if he had
drawn himself farther off, they might have met with equal Difficulties.
After having discoursed in this manner, he came to <hi>Apollonia,</hi> and from
thence privately by Night took his March towards <hi>Thessaly;</hi> and on the
way, coming to a little City called <hi>Gomphes,</hi> that refused to open their
Gates, he took it by Storm, and gave the Plunder to his Soldiers; who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
long endured Scarcity, fed now beyond measure, and filled themselves
with Wine; especially the<note n="*" place="margin">Ger na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s;</note> Almains, whose Drunkenness made them ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
to all the rest: So that here again in all appearance, <hi>Pompey</hi> lost a
fair occasion of Victory by not pursuing an Enemy he despised; but lying
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65196:179"/>
still, whilst in seven days March he got into <hi>Thessaly,</hi> and encamped near
<hi>Pharsalia.</hi> It is reported there happened at <hi>Gomphes</hi> a thing very memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
that in an Apothecary's Shop there were found twenty Old Men, all
People of Quality, lying groveling upon the Ground, with Caps by them,
in the posture of Drunken Men, dead without any Wound; and another
sitting in a Chair, who, acting the Physitian, had presented the Cups to
the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXII"/> After <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Departure, <hi>Pompey</hi> held a Council of his Friends; where
<hi>Affranius</hi> Advice was, that he should employ the Sea-Forces, in which
they were the stronger, to pursue <hi>Caesar</hi> now flying and necessitous, and to
incommode him what they could, whilst <hi>Pompey</hi> with the Land-Army past
speedily into <hi>Italy,</hi> which favoured their Party, and where the other had
no Forces; and placing good Garrisons both in <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> without stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from home, settle the Seat of the War in the Capital City of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
But this Advice, though perfectly good, was not followed; they
chose rather to believe those who maintained that <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Army would soon
by Famine be forced to yield to them; or if that happened not, yet after
the Success of <hi>Dirrachium,</hi> it was no great Task to give Perfection to that
Victory; that besides, it would be a shame to let <hi>Caesar</hi> fly without pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, or to let it be said that the Vanquished and the Vanquisher fled
each their several ways. <hi>Pompey</hi> therefore moved by these Arguments, but
principally out of Consideration of the Eastern Nation, and of <hi>Lucius Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,</hi>
lest any disgrace should happen to him in <hi>Macedon;</hi> and besides this,
assuring himself upon the Alacrity of his Soldiers, who ardently desired to
fight, followed <hi>Caesar:</hi> And as well as he encamped near <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thirty Furlongs distance from him, Provisions were brought to him
from all Parts; for he had before fortifyed the Passages, the Havens and
the Forts; so that he had continual Supplies by Land, and every Wind
brought him some by Sea. But <hi>Caesar</hi> had no more than what he daily with
much difficulty sent out to forage for; yet, for all that, none of his Men
forsook him: On the contrary, as if they had been animated by some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Spirit, they testifyed an incredible earnestness to fight. They conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that being all Veterans, trained to War for ten Years together, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to deal only with Raw Soldiers, they should prove the stronger; but
if the War were spun out in length, and they forced to labour in Trenches
and other Works, Age already growing upon them, the consuming more
time would be to their disadvantage: Wherefore they desired no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay;
thinking it better to try the Fortune of Arms, than to fight longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Hunger and Famine. On the other side, <hi>Pompey,</hi> who knew all these
things, judged there might be danger in coming to an Engagement, and
committing himself to the hazard of a Battel with experienced Men, whom
Despair had made capable of attempting any thing; and who were besides
commanded by <hi>Caesar,</hi> the most fortunate General of the World: But that
he might more securely and with more facility defear them, streitned as
they were, and already weakned with want of all things, the Country
where they lay not being over fertile, and they having no Sea-Port, nor so
much as a Ship to escape in: He therefore resolved, and surely with a great
deal of Prudence, not to fight; but vanquish his half-starved Enemies by
starving them more. But having with him a great number of Senators of
the same Quality with himself, the Choice of all the Roman Knights, and
many Kings and Potentates, they all exhorted him to give Battel; some out
of Ignorance, others having in their Heads the Victory at <hi>Dirrachium,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65196:179"/>
relying upon the great number of their Forces, in which they had the
advantage; and some, who, weary of the War, chose rather to hazard
Victory at one push, than attend it from good Conduct. They shewed
him <hi>Caesar</hi> provoking him to fight, and always drawn out in Battel. But he
turned that Example against themselves; and told them, <hi>Caesar</hi> did that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forced to it by Famine, and that he ought the rather to lie quiet, the more
<hi>Caesar</hi> was streitned for want of Provisions.</p>
               <p>And yet at last, seeing all the Army, puffed up with the last Victory, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIII"/>
to fight; and that many Persons of Quality reproached him that he
loved to command, and that he spun out the War with design to maintain
himself so much the longer above so many People his Equals; that they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him King and <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> because <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had likewise comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Kings during the War; he was constrained to forego the Resolution he
had taken. And now Fortune, which had not been over-favourable to him
in many other Accidents of this War, forsook him quite. He grew fainter
and slower than ordinarily he used to be; and prepared for this Fight much
against his Will, to his Ruin, and the Loss of those who counselled him to it.
<hi>Caesar</hi> had that Night sent out two Legions to go fetch in Corn; for praising
<hi>Pompey</hi> for temporizing, and believing he would continue to do so, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
nothing more than the bringing Provisions to his Camp from all
sides: But when he had a little notice that his Enemy was disposed to give
Battel, he was very joyful, conjecturing him forced to it by the head-strong
humour of his Soldiers; and causing those two Legions sent out for Forrage,
speedily to return, he gave all his Men Order to be in a readiness: About
Midnight he sacrificed to <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> his Mother (for it is said, that the
Family of the <hi>Iulii</hi> had their Original as well as Name from <hi>Iulus,</hi> Son to
<hi>Aeneas</hi>) and withal, made a Vow to build a Temple in the City in Honour
of that Goddess. After the Sacrifice, there having appeared a stream of
Lightning, which extended it self from <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Camp over that of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s:
Those of this Party promised themselves a bright and glorious Victory; but
<hi>Caesar</hi> interpreted it to his advantage; saying, he was going with one blow
to extinguish all the Glory and Power of <hi>Pompey.</hi> As <hi>Pompey</hi> sacrificed the
same Night, the Victims escaping, could not be retaken, a Swarm of Bees
came and set upon the Altars: There was raised a little before Day in <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey's</hi>
Army a Panick Terror; which yet himself going from Quarter to
Quarter, appeased, and after slept soundly; and when his Friends waked
him, told them, he dreamed he was dedicating a Temple in the City to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
the Victorious: His Familiars and his Soldiers, who had heard nothing
of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Vow, rejoyced mightily at it, they believed the Advantage cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
theirs, and began to despise the Enemy, and do things more by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse
of Passion than Reason; in so much, that some crowned their Tents
with Laurel, which is the Token of Victory, and made their Slaves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
Magnificent Feasts: Nay, some there were who disputed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for <hi>Caesar</hi>'s High Priesthood. <hi>Pompey,</hi> who had great experience in
what related to War, had an aversion for all these things; but he let not his
Anger break forth, for it would have been a trouble to him, neither did he
now think it secure to reprove People who loved rather to command than
obey, and who by their Importunity had forced him to actagainst his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
So stupifyed was now this Great Man, who had ever before been
so happy; whether he were troubled that his Counsel was slighted, being
so perfectly good, and that he was constrained to hazard the safety of so
many Men, together with his own Glory, which never yet had any like it;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65196:180"/>
or whether his Genius presenting to him his approaching Misfortune, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him, being just at the point of losing in one moment so great and sublime
an Authority. However, at length having said to his Friends, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
gained the Victory that day, would be the Commencement of infinite
Calamities to the Roman People, he began to draw up his Army in Battel:
from whence some making reflexion on these words which on a suddain heat
escaped him, have believed that if he had been Victorious, he would have
made himself Master of the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIV"/> Now, to give an Account of the number of the Forces on both Parts,
without having recourse to that Multitude of Authors, who so ill agree in
this Point, I will follow the gravest of the Romans; who report exactly the
number of the Italians, as the principal Force of the Army, and make little
mention of the Auxiliaries, whom indeed they had but little consideration
of. <hi>Caesar</hi> had about two and twenty thousand Men, of whom about a
thousand were Horse; and <hi>Pompey</hi> had half as many more, of whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
seven thousand were Horse: So that most credible Authors say, that
there were about seventy thousand Italians in both Armies; those who are
most modest say, sixty thousand; and those who are boldest, four hundred
thousand; of whom some say <hi>Pompey</hi>'s made more than half, others that
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s were but one third; so difficult it is, exactly to know the truth. But
however it were, both the one and the other Party placed their chief Rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
on those of that Nation: Not but that <hi>Caesar</hi> had good Auxiliary For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
he had French Cavalry, and a great number of Transalpine Gauls, and
Grecian Light Armed Foot of the Acarnanians, Etolians and Dolopes. But
<hi>Pompey</hi> had a great multitude of all the Oriental Nations, as well Horse as
Foot; out of <hi>Greece,</hi> the Lacedemonians with their Kings, the other Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponnesians
and Boeotians; and even the Athenians came to this War. Though
both Parties had caused it to be proclaimed by the publick Cryer, that all
Persons were forbid touching them, being Priests to <hi>Ceres,</hi> the Inventor of
Laws; yet would they come to bear Arms, that they might have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to fight for the Roman Empire. After the Greeks, came Troops of
almost all Nations lying upon the Sea-Coasts of the <hi>Levant</hi> Seas; from
<hi>Thrace,</hi> from the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> from <hi>Bithynia, Phrygia, Ionia, Lydia, Pamphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,
Pisidia, Paphlagonia, Cilicia, Syria, Phaenicia, Iudaea, Arabia, Cyprus,
Rhodes;</hi> with Slingers from <hi>Crete,</hi> and all the other Isles. There were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
Kings and Sovereigns with their Forces: <hi>Deiotarus,</hi> Tetrarch of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lograecia;</hi>
and <hi>Ariarathes,</hi> King of <hi>Cappadocia; Taxiles</hi> lead the Armenians
from this side the <hi>Euphrates;</hi> and <hi>Megabates,</hi> Lieutenant of King <hi>Artabasus,</hi>
those from beyond that River; besides several little Sovereigns that brought
what Forces they had. They say likewife, that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and her Brother,
yet a Child, sent sixty Gallies; whose Forces were not at the Fight no more
than those of the rest of the Fleet, who lay doing nothing at <hi>Corcyra.</hi> And
most certain it is that <hi>Pompey</hi> was not so prudent as he ought to have been,
in not making good use of his Naval Forces; in which he was so strong, that
he might always have hindred the bringing from any place Provisions to his
Enemy; but chusing rather to fight on Land against Men hardened to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and accustomed to Victory: But it is apparent that the Victory at
<hi>Dyrrachium</hi> made him slacken his Care, and that nothing could have been
more advantageous to <hi>Caesar</hi> than that loss; for <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Soldiers, grown
proud with that Success, would no longer obey; and marched against their
Enemies hand over head. But decreed it was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he should commit this fault,
to give Birth to that Empire which extends it self so far over the Nations of
the Earth.</p>
               <p>

those Enemies you so far surpass in number: Despise them as young and vigorous
Conquerors should the Vanquished, surcharged with Age and tired with Labour.
Besides, your advantage over them lies not only in your Preparations and Forces,
but in the Testimony of your own Consciences, and in the Iustice of your Cause;

promise you made me at <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> and in what manner you swore to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in my presence, never to return from the Fight without Victory. These are
the Men we are come to seek from as far as the Pillars of <hi>Hercules;</hi> those who
durst not stand us, but fled before us out of <hi>Italy;</hi> these, who, after we had fought
ten Years together for the Glory of our Country, after that we had gained a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Victories, and added to the Roman Empire four hundred Nations in
<hi>Spain, Gaul</hi> and <hi>Brittany;</hi> would have deprived us of the Honours due to us, of
the Triumphs and other Recompences our Services merited. In a word, these
whom I could never move, neither by the Iustice of my Right, nor by the Favours
I have done them; for you know how many of them I have set free without doing
them the least injury, in hopes they would do things reasonable for me. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
then their Injustice; and if ever you did believe I had any kindness or good
will for you, if you, if you have ever experienced my Liberality or received my Largesses,
let this Day's Actions make good your Acknowledgments. It is no hard matter
for Old Soldiers to overcome Hot-headed Young sters, unskilled in the Mystery;
and who like Children, come to the business in disorder, and despising their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral:
for I am certainly assured he himself leads them trembling, and sore against
his mind to this Battel; for seeing his Fortune grow old, he is himself grown
slothful and stupid, and does not so much command as obey the Command of others.

Hitherto I have yet spoke to you only concerning the Italians; for the Strangers,
I would not have you trouble your selves, nor account them for any thing; nor
would I have you go to charge the Slaves of <hi>Syria, Lydia</hi> and <hi>Phrygia,</hi> only born
for Flight and Servitude: I know it certainly, and you shall see it, that <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
will not give them any place in his Battel. Engage therefore only the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
and if the Strangers come to run after you like Dogs, when you have routed
the Italians, spare them as your Allies; but put all the Strangers to the Sword, to
strike a terror in others. But first of all, to perswade me that you remember your
promise, and that you desire to die or overcome, as you go out of the Camp I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

for Guard of the Baggage; and the rest, as they came out of the Camp,
pulled up the Pallissade and filled up the Ditch with as little noise as might
be: Which being told to <hi>Pompey</hi> by some who thought they prepared
themselves for Flight; he knowing their Confidence, began to sigh, that he
must fight against fierce Beasts, whom he might have defeated by Famine;
which is the only way to reduce Beasts. But now there was no going back;
for as the Proverb says, <hi>The Knife was at his Throat.</hi> Wherefore, leaving
four thousand Legionary Soldiers for the Guard of the Camp, he caused
the rest to march in Battalia between <hi>Pharsalia</hi> and the River <hi>Enipeus;</hi>
where <hi>Caesar</hi> planted himself directly opposite to him: So that the Front of
both Battels was composed of the Legions, in three Bodies, at some distance
one from the other; whose Flanks were covered with two Wings of Horse,
among whom were mixed Archeres and Slingers. The Legions, in whom
both Parties placed their chief Hope, being ranged in this Order, they
brought on the Strangers, more for Shew than Service. <hi>Pompey</hi> had a great
number of divers Languages, out of which he drew apart the Macedonians,
Peloponnesians, Boeotians and Athenians, as more accustomed to keep their
Ranks with silence, and placed them near his Legions; and for the others,
<hi>Caesar</hi> had conjectured he drew them into a Body apart, with Orders to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron
the Enemy as soon as the Battel was begun, and to do what they could
to break in and plunder <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Camp, whose Works he had seen thrown
down. <hi>Scipio,</hi> Father in Law to <hi>Pompey,</hi> was in the middle of the Battel,
<hi>L. Domitius</hi> on the Left Wing, <hi>Lentulus</hi> on the Right, and <hi>Affranius</hi> stayed
for Guard of the Camp. In <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Army <hi>Sylla, Anthony</hi> and <hi>Cn. Domitius</hi>
commanded; and he, according to his custom, chose his place at the Head
of the Tenth Legion: Which the Enemies having observed, they opposed
against him all their best Horse; that being the stronger in number, they
might inclose him. <hi>Caesar,</hi> on the contrary, knowing their design, drew
off a Body of three thousand Men of the best of his Foot to releive him upon
occasion; and commanded, that as soon as they saw the Enemy come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
him, they should charge them with their Piles, aiming chiefly at the
Face; for young and unexperienced People who put value on their Beauty,
would be fearful to receive any Wound might render them deformed. And
now the Generals went through the Ranks to give necessary Orders, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them to shew their Courage, and giving them the Word for that day;
which on <hi>Caesar</hi>'s side was, Venus <hi>the Victorious;</hi> and on <hi>Pompey</hi>'s, Hercules
<hi>the Invincible.</hi> Thus standing in Battalia, they for a long time kept silence
on both sides; each Party keeping his Ground, and expecting when the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65196:181"/>
other should begin the Fight. For they were moved with Compassion to
see the greatest number of Forces that had ever before been seen together of
the Italian Nation, and all Chosen Men, about to expose themselves to the
Hazard and Uncertainty of a Battel, for the Interest and Passion of two Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
envious of each other: And as the Danger approached, the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wherewith they had hitherto been blinded, began to remit, and give place
to Fear. Reason having chased away the furious Appetite of Glory, began
to represent to them the greatness and the Cause of the Disgrace wherein
they might fall. That two Men disputed for the Preheminence with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of their Lives, and yet neither could promise to himself the living in
the meanest Degree, unless he got the Victory: And that for their Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
such numbers of brave Men were about to hazard their utter Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
It came likewife into their Minds, that having so lately been Friends
and Allies, and endeavoured to render each other mutual Service for the
Support of their Grandeur, they should now draw Swords one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and oblige to be Followeres in their criminal Passion so many Generals
and Officers, among whom nothing but Concord ought to have been main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
being of the same City, and some of them Brethren; for so they
were, having engaged themselves unawares, as in two different Parties of
so many thousand Men of the same Notion, many extraordinary things must
necessarily happen. Thus the two Generals making these reflecrtions, were
touched with remorse; and because this Day was to make one of them the
first or the last of all Men, they could not easily resolve to begin a Fight, the
Success whereof was so soubtful. Some report, that both of them shed
tears.</p>
               <p>The Day was now well advanced, whilst both Parties thus stood viewing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVII"/>
one another, and the Legions stood firm, without moving from their places;
till <hi>Pompey</hi> perceiving that the Strangers, wearied with the delay, kept their
Ranks but ill; fearing lest by their Example the others might take the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to do the same before the Battel began, commanded first to sound the
Charge; which <hi>Caesar</hi> on the other side immediately scconded. And now
the Soldiers, heartned by the sound of the Trumpets, and the presence of
their Officers; who going through the Ranks, encouraged them to do well,
began to march one againsts the other with an incredible Vehemence; yet
with deep silence, like People who had often been upon the same Occasions.
When they came within a Dart's Flight the Light-Armed Foot gave the first
Discharge, and then the Horse fell on; where after having given great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
of their Valour on both sides, <hi>Pompey</hi>'s had the Advantage, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more numerous; and went about to invest the Tenth Legion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Caesar</hi> gave a Sign to his Reserve appointed for that purpose to advance,
which at an instant they did, throwing their Piles at the Faces of the Horse-men;
who, not able to bear the Brunt of these desperate Men, nor endure
that they should pierce their Cheeks and thrust out their Eyes, fled away in
disorder: Which gave Opportunity to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Horse, who before were fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to be environed, to charge <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Legions in Flank, where they lay
naked, being deserted by the Horse-men. <hi>Pompey</hi> advised of it, gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to his Foot not to advance farther, nor to assail the Enemy, nor to throw
any Pile; but presenting their Points to those came at them, to fight stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Ground. Some have praised this way of fighting invented by
<hi>Pompey,</hi> as advantageous to those that are like to be inclosed: But <hi>Caesar</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approves
it in his Commentaries; because, in casting the Pile the blow is
more violent, and the motion gives life to the Courage of the Soldier, which
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65196:182"/>
grows cold and faint by standing still; besides, that it is more easie to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
those are only planted like Stakes, which now happened; for after <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s
Horse had charged upon the Flank, <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Right Wing, which lay
naked, and stood still whilst they poured upon them at distance whole
Showers of Darts: The tenth Legion came up close to them in Front; and
finding them in Disorder, made them give Ground; which was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Victory. In other places they fought with divers Success, and
every where made a great Slaughter; yet in a Fight of so many Legions
there was not heard the least Cry, either of the Wounded, or of those that
fell, save only the last dying Gasps and Groans of them who gave up the
Ghost in the same place where they had fought. The Strangers, Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of so many noble Actions, were astonished to see Soldiers so resolutely
keep their Ranks; in so much, that surprized with their height of Bravery
as at a Miracle, they durst not so much as attempt <hi>Caesar's</hi>
Camp, defended
only by a few Old People; but stood like Stocks, or Men that had lost their
Senses. But when they saw <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Right Wing, pressed hard by <hi>Caesar,</hi>
begin to recoil, yet still fighting in the same manner, they set a running all
towards the Camp, crying out, they had lost the Day; and after having pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
down and plundered the Tents of their own Party, fled every Man which
way they best could. The noise of this Rout made the other Legions give
Ground, first in good Order, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> defending themselves the best they might;
but at last, charged home by the Enemy, who now found himself the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
they likewise betook themselves to Flight. And now <hi>Caesar,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their Rallying, and to make an end at once, not only of this Battel, but
of the whole War, did an Action of great Prudence in causing it to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
throughout his whole Camp, that they should spare the Citizen,
and put the Stranger to the Sword; for at the same time the Vanquishers
pursuing the Vanquished, bid them stay there in safety: And the Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those Orders having passed from hand to hand through both Armies,
that Saying, <hi>Stay there in Safety,</hi> served as a word to <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Men, to make
themselves be known; and that the easier, because being all Italians, they
wore the same Habit, and spoke the same Language. Thus <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
passing by their Country-men, sell upon the Strangers; of whom they
made a mighty Slaughter, they not being in any posture of defence. <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
beholding his Men fly, lost his Courage, retreating by little and little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Camp; and being entred his Tent, sat still a great while without say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a word, like to <hi>Ajax Telamon;</hi> to whom, as it is said, something like this
happened at the time of the Trojan War. But few of his Men returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Camp, because it having been told them at the time of the Defeat,
that they should stay there in safety; and their Enemies having done them
no violence, they were dispersed by Companies on one side and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Towards the Evening <hi>Caesar</hi> going through all his Army, began to
entreat the Soldiers not to think of any repose, till they had taken <hi>Pompey</hi>'s
Camp; telling them, that if they suffered the Enemy to rally, they were
only victorious for a day; whereas by making themselves Masters of the
Camp, they made their Victory perfect, and gave the last Stroke to the
Work: Wherefore, stretching out his hands like those that supplicate, he
began himself to advance that way before them all. Though they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
tired, yet <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Discourse and Authority gave them new strength,
besides their present good Foutune, and the hopes they had to force the
Trenches, which they thought a thing very important; and there is no su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
Remedy against Weariness than Hope: So they stormed the Pallissade
with scorn of those that defended it. When <hi>Pompey</hi> was told of it, he at length
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65196:182"/>
broke his profound Silence with these words; <hi>And how! Into our very Camp.</hi>
And presently changing Habit, mounted on Horse-back; and accompanied
by four of his Friends, rid all Night full Speed, and at Break of Day came
to <hi>Larissa. Caesar,</hi> as he had foretold when he was drawing out his Army,
lodged in <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Camp, supped with Meat they had made ready for him,
and the whole Army was feasted at the Enemy's Charge. As for the Dead
on both sides, as well Romans as Allies, (for the number of the Strangers
was so great it was hard to count them; besides, none took the pains) <hi>Caesar</hi>
lost thirty Centurions, and two hundred Legionary Soldiers; or according
to the Account of others, twelve hundred: And on <hi>Pompey</hi>'s side theredy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ten Senators, among whom was <hi>L. Domitius</hi> who had been sent into
<hi>Gaul,</hi> Successor to <hi>Caesar;</hi> and about forty Roman Knights of the best Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of the City; for the Soldiery, those who set down the greatest number
say five and twenty thousand: But <hi>Asinius Pollio</hi> one of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Captains
who commanded in this Battel, writes in his Commentaries, that there
were not above six thousand slain. Such was the success of the famous Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
of <hi>Pharsalia.</hi> Among those who did best, they give the first place to
<hi>Caesar,</hi> the second place to the same <hi>Caesar,</hi> with the Tenth Legion, by the
Consent of all the World; and the third Honour is due to the Centurion
<hi>Crastinus,</hi> whom <hi>Caesar,</hi> as he went out of the Camp, having asken, what
hopes he had of the Battel? replyed with a loud voice; <hi>We will over come,
Caesar; and thou shall this day praise me, either alive or dead.</hi> And indeed,
all the Army bare witness, that they had seen him run like a Fury through
the Bottalions, and do Actions almost incredible. His Body being found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Dead, <hi>Caesar</hi> adorned it with Military Rewards; and in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
caused it to be be buried apart, with a Magnificent Tomb, near the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sepulture of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> departing immediately from <hi>Larissa,</hi> came to the Sea; and going <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVIII"/>
first into a little Boat, met by chance with a Ship, and got to <hi>Mitylene:</hi>
where taking with him <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and lading his Equipage upon four Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
come to him from <hi>Rhodes</hi> and <hi>Tyre,</hi> he would go neither to <hi>Corcira,</hi> nor
to <hi>Africa,</hi> where he had another Army and a Powerful Fleet; but chose
rather the way of the East towards the King of the Parthians, by whose Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
he hoped to recover all he had lost. He told his Design to no one, till
being ready to land in <hi>Cilicid,</hi> he discovered it to his Friends; but they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
him not to trust the Parthian, against whom <hi>Crassus</hi> had so lately to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ill purpose made War, and was still puffed up with Victory he had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against the Romans: Besides, it was not safe to carry among Barbarians
a beautiful Woman like <hi>Cornelia,</hi> who was moreover, <hi>Crassus</hi> Widdow:
They therefore proposed to him either <hi>Egypt</hi> or King <hi>Iuba;</hi> the later they
thought not of sufficient Reputation, but all counselled his Retreat into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.
They alledged that it was not far off, that it was a Powerful King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
an Excellent Country, where he would want neither Shipping nor
Provisions, nor Money; and whose Kings, though yet but Minors, were
obliged to serve him, because of the good Offices he had done their Father.
So by those Reasons he was perswaded to bend his Course towards <hi>Egypt.</hi>
There was at present a Division in the Royal Family; <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> who before
reigned joyntly with her Brother <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> being driven out, now raised
Forces about <hi>Syria;</hi> and <hi>Ptolemy</hi> her Brother was encamped near Mount
<hi>Cassia,</hi> on the Frontiers of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to hinder her Re-entry into the Kingdom.
It happened that the Wind drove <hi>Pompey</hi> into that place; who seeing so
great an Army on the Shore, stopped; and because he judged, as it proved
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65196:183"/>
true, that the King was there, he sent one to give him advice of the Cause
of his coming, and to remember him of his Friendship with his Father. He
was yet but thirteen Years of Age; and had for Overseers <hi>Achillas</hi> in what
concerned Affairs of War, and <hi>Photinus</hi> the Eunuch for the Treasury:
Those began to consult betwixt them what they should do in this Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;
and having called to counsel with them <hi>Theodatus</hi> the Rhetorician,
School-Master to the Infant King. He proposed to them an execrable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
which was, to cut off <hi>Pompey,</hi> to gain the favour of <hi>Caesar:</hi> Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
resolved on, under pretence that in that place the Sea was full of Shoals,
so that greater Vessels could not approach, they sent him a wretched Boat,
in which there were some Officers of the Royal House, and with them a
certain Roman Soldier called<note n="*" place="margin">Septimius <hi>in all other Authors</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Sempronius,</hi> who now bore Arms in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
but had formerly served under <hi>Pompey.</hi> He presented him his hand on the
Part of <hi>Ptolemy;</hi> inviting him to enter, and go with him to his Friend, who
waited for him. Mean while the Army was drawn up in Battel on the Sea
Shore; in the midst of which appeared the King, clad in his Royal Robes,
as if to do Honour to his Guest. Though <hi>Pompey</hi> had already some cause to
distrust, considering this Army in Battel, the pittifulness of the Boat, that
the King came not in Person to meet him, nor sent any Person of Quality;
yet he went into the Skiff, repeating to himself these Lines of <hi>Sophocles.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>To Tyrants Courts, the Valiant and the Brave;</l>
                     <l>Though free they enter, soon become their Slave.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>When he saw that after he was got some distance from his Ships no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
spoke to him, his suspition increased. Wherefore, either knowing
<hi>Sempronius</hi> for a Roman, or a Soldier that had served under him, or conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturing
it because he only stood up, according to the Discipline of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
which permits not Soldiers to sit before their General; he said, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
towards him, <hi>Surely I have known you, Fellow Soldier:</hi> Which <hi>Sempro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
having acknowledged, as soon as he turned away, he gave him the first
blow, which was followed by many others that took away his Life. His
Wife and Friends seeing afar off this Murther, began to cry out; and lifting
up their hands to Heaven, imploring the Gods Revengers of violated Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
with all speed took their Flight. <hi>Photinus</hi>'s People cut off <hi>Pompey</hi>'s
Head, which he kept to present to <hi>Caesar</hi> when he should arrive in <hi>Egypt,</hi> out
of hopes of a great Reward; but he revenged this Murther as became him.
Some one having found the Trunk of his Body, buried it upon the Sea-Shore,
raising over it a little Tomb; upon which some other wrote this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription;
<q>
                     <l>Scarce should a Temple to hold that suffice,</l>
                     <l>Which huddled in a little Sand, here lies.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This Sepulchre being in process of time quite covered over with Sand,
the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> visiting that Country, caused it in these our times to
be sought for; and after having found it with the Copper Images which the
Inhabitants of these Coasts had dedicated to <hi>Pompey,</hi> which were fallen with
age in the ruines of a Temple, he caused the Rubbi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> to be removed, made
the Sepulchre visible, and set up the Images. Thus ended this great Man
his days, after having fortunately put an end to many Wars of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
and augmented the Roman Empire, by which he got the Title of
Great. Never before had he been vanquished, and from his very youth
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65196:183"/>
began to be happy in all his undertakings; for from the three and twentieth
to the eight and fiftieth year of his age, he had in effect the power of a
King, though he took upon him only the quality of a private Citizen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the dispute for preheminence between him and <hi>Caesar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucius Scipio</hi> his Father-in-law, and all the rest of the persons of Quality <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIX"/>
that escaped from the Battel of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> retired to <hi>Corcyra,</hi> where they
had of purpose left <hi>Cato</hi> with other Forces and three hundred Galleys.
There having divided the Fleet among <hi>Pompey</hi>'s chief Friends, <hi>Cassius</hi> sailed
towards <hi>Pontus</hi> to engage <hi>Pharnaces</hi> to take up Arms against <hi>Caesar; Scipio</hi>
and <hi>Cato</hi> went into <hi>Africa,</hi> relying upon those Forces <hi>Varus</hi> had, and the
assistance they hoped for from <hi>Iuba</hi> King of the Moors. And <hi>Pompey</hi>'s El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Son, with <hi>Labienus Scapula</hi> and another part of the Army, went by
great Journeys to <hi>Spain,</hi> with design to draw that Province to their Party,
to raise other Forces of Spaniards, Celtiberians, and even of Slaves, and to
make the greatest Preparations they possibly could; so great were yet the
Wrecks of <hi>Pompey's</hi> Power, which by a prodigious blindness he deserted
and fled. The Soldiers in <hi>Africa</hi> offered <hi>Cato</hi> the chief Command; but he
refused it, because there were there present Lieutenants of Consular Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and he had never arrived to higher Dignity in the City than the Charge
of Pretor. Wherefore <hi>L. Scipio</hi> being chosen General of that Army, he
laboured likewise in these Quarters to encrease and exercise his Forces; so
that there were raised at the same time two powerful Armies against <hi>Caesar;</hi>
one in <hi>Africa,</hi> and the other in <hi>Spain.</hi> He for his part stayed at <hi>Pharsalia</hi>
but two days after the Victory, that he might sacrifice to the Gods in the
Field of the Battel, and suffer the Soldiers take some repose, tired with the
Toil of that Great Day. He likewise granted Liberty to the Thessalians, who
had served him faithfully upon this Occasion: And the Athenians coming
to demand his Pardon, he forgave them with these words; <hi>How often must
the Glory of your Predecessors with-hold you from falling down those Precipices
whither your own faults lead you?</hi> The third day he marched towards the
East, whither he understood <hi>Pompey</hi> was fled: As he passed the <hi>Hellespont</hi>
upon little Boats for want of Ships, in the middle of the Strait <hi>Cassius</hi> (in
his way to <hi>Pharnaces</hi>) suddainly comes up with a great number of Gallies;
and though he might with so many Bottoms have easily defeated his Enemy,
who was infinitely the weaker; yet such was the prodigious good Fortune
of <hi>Caesar,</hi> that the other was so extremely surprized, thinking he was come
of purpose to meet him, that of his own accord he yielded himself into his
Hands, demanded Pardon, and delivered up to him the Fleet; so powerful
was the Opinion only of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s continual Happiness, for I can find out no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cause; and am of Opinion, that in all the Dangers he ever encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,
his good Fortune never served him to better purpose than now, when
<hi>Cassius,</hi> a Warlike Man, having seventy Gallies, meeting him by chance so
ill prepared, durst not attempt to fight him; and yet, after he had setled
himself in the Supreme Power in the City, he who out of a Cowardly faint-heartedness
yielded to him in his Passage, killed him in the height of his
Prosperities; which proves the more, that <hi>Cassius,</hi> terrifyed in that manner,
yielded only to the Fortune that advanced <hi>Caesar.</hi> Thus escaping beyond his
Hopes, as soon as he was landed, the <hi>Ionians, Etolians,</hi> and other Nations
inhabiting that great <hi>Peninsula,</hi> which is called <hi>Asia Minor,</hi> sent Deputies
to him, to crave his Pardon; which he granted: And understanding that
<hi>Pompey</hi> was gone towards <hi>Egypt,</hi> he sailed towards <hi>Rhodes;</hi> whence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
staying for his Army, whom he had ordered to rendezvouz in this Island,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65196:184"/>
he embarked on <hi>Cassius</hi> his Gallies, and those of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> with those Forces
he had, and towards the Evening went to Sea: He told no body whither he
designed, but only gave Order to the Pylates to follow the Admiral's Light
by Night, and the Flag by Day. And when he was in the Main Sea, he
commanded the Master of his Galley to stear towards <hi>Alexandria;</hi> where
he arrived the third Day after. The King's Tutors, who were still about
Mount <hi>Cassia,</hi> came forthwith to receive him: And having at his Arrival
but few People about him, he remained for some time without doing any
thing. In the mean time he civilly received all such as visited him, walked
often about the City under pretence of being pleased to view it, went often
to Philosophy Schools; where standing, he would hear the Professors: and
by this manner of living, he gained the Favour and Esteem of all the People
of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> But when his Army was arrived he put to death <hi>Achillas</hi> and
<hi>Photinus,</hi> for their Villany committed on the Person of <hi>Pompey;</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi>
then escaping him, <hi>Cassius</hi> after finding him in <hi>Asia,</hi> caused to be hanged.
The Alexandrians hereupon taking Arms, and the King's Army coming to
oppose <hi>Caesar,</hi> they fought in several Engagements with divers Success, as
well about the Palace as the adjoyning Shores; so that once <hi>Caesar,</hi> pressed
hard upon by the Enemy, threw himself into the Sea, and escaped them by
swimming; and his Coat-Armour falling into the Egyptians hands, they
hung it up in the place appointed for Trophies. But in the end, in the last
Battel, fought near the <hi>Nile,</hi> where the King was in Person, <hi>Caesar</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Conqueror. He spent nine Months in all these Affairs, till such time as
he setled <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt</hi> instead of her Brother, and
made a Progress with her upon the <hi>Nile,</hi> followed by four hundred Vessels,
to see the Country, or perhaps being in love with that Woman; but we
will speak of those things in writing the Affairs of <hi>Egypt.</hi> When they
would have presented to him <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Head, he would not see it; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
it should be interred in the Suburbs, where he consecrated a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
to the Goddess <hi>Nemesis,</hi> which in our time, when the Emperor <hi>Trajan</hi>
made cruel War upon them, the Jews pulled down; the demolishing it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of importance to them. <hi>Caesar</hi> having done these things in <hi>Egypt,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his Army to march with little noise through <hi>Syria,</hi> against <hi>Pharnaces,</hi>
who had already been successful in many Occasions; he had seized upon some
places depending on the Romans; he had defeated <hi>Domitius, Caesar</hi>'s Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
in a Set Battel; and puffed up with this Success, had sacked the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Amisa</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Pontus,</hi> and publickly sold one part of the
Inhabitants, and made Eunuchs of all who had not obtained the Age of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty:
But frightned at <hi>Caesar</hi>'s coming, and repenting of what he had
done; when he was come within two hundred Furlongs of him, he sent to
him Ambassadors to treat of Peace; with Orders to present him with a
Crown of Gold, and very impertinently to offer him the Daughter of their
King in Marriage. When he had heard the Occasion of their coming, he
made his Army march; and amusing the Ambassadors with words, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
up to <hi>Pharnaces</hi> Camp; where beginning to cry out, <hi>Shall not Parricide
now be immediately punished,</hi> he leaped on Horse-back, and with the first
Shout put the Enemy to Flight, and made a great Slaughter without any of
his Army's drawing their Swords, save only a thousand Horse that first fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him when he began the Charge. Some Historians report that he
should now say; <hi>O! how happy was</hi> Pompey, <hi>to have gained such Reputation,
with the Title of GREAT, for having to deal with such People in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridatick
War.</hi> And concerning this Victory he wrote to the City; <hi>I came,
I saw, I overcame.</hi> As for <hi>Pharnaces,</hi> he was content to retire into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65196:184"/>
of <hi>Bosphorus,</hi> which <hi>Pompey</hi> left him; and <hi>Caesar</hi> had not now leisure
to pursue him, or lose time in these letter Affairs, being called elsewhere by
so many more important Wars; wherefore he directed his Course towards
<hi>Italy,</hi> taking up all along as he marched through <hi>Asia</hi> the Tribute-Money,
which much troubled the Commissioners, who had raised it upon the People
with a thousand Cruelties, as we have said in writing the Affairs of <hi>Asia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Understanding by Letters that he received from <hi>Rome,</hi> that the City was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXX"/>
extremely tormented with new Seditions; and that <hi>Anthony,</hi> General of his
Horse, had with the Army seized upon the Great Place; he left the Affairs
of <hi>Asia,</hi> to make all speed thither. His Presence forthwith appeased the
Tumult of the City, but there was another raised against himself: The
Soldiers required to be payed what was promised them at <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
exposed their Lives; and that they might be dismissed, having served
the time appointed by the Laws. He caused them in Excuse to be told, that
the Victory of <hi>Pharsalia</hi> was not yet perfect, because War still continued in
<hi>Africa:</hi> but as soon as that was ended, he would perform his Promise, and
give them over and above a thousand Drams a Head. They with arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
replyed, that they stood not in need of Promises, but of ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
so that <hi>Crispus Salustus,</hi> who was sent to them, was fain to save his
Life by Flight. Upon report hereof made to <hi>Caesar,</hi> he drew <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which had been left for the Guard of the City, about his House, and
to the Guard of the Gates, left the Mutineers should in their fury begin to
plunder Private Houses. And himself, contrary to the Advice of all his
Friends, who counselled him not to expose himself to the fury of an Incensed
Multitude; with a signal Audacity of Mind, as they were in the Field of
<hi>Mars,</hi> came suddainly upon them: And mounting on a place where he
might be seen by all the Mutining Companies, they ran to him, not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased,
but without Arms; and saluting him, called him Emperor, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Custom. He commanding them to tell him what it was they desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
they durst not speak of Money, because he surprized them with his
Presence; but out of the hopes they were in, that he yet standing in need of
the Army to make an end of the Remainder of the War, would (if they
desired to be dismissed) himself speak of the Gift he had promised them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
themselves to cry out all with one Voice, that they intreated him to
discharge them: To which, without any delay, he made answer, <hi>That he
granted their Request;</hi> and seeing them so much the more astonished at this
Answer, as they least of any thing expected it, and that they stood in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
silence, he added; <hi>I will, notwithstanding, give you all that I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
you as soon as I have triumphed with others.</hi> This word filled their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Soul with Shame and Jealousie; considering what an Infamy it would be
for them, if after having deserted their General under pretence of being
weary of the War, new Soldiers should follow his Triumphant Chariot:
Besides, they should deprive themselves of the Booty they might get in the
African War, and render themselves odious both to <hi>Caesar</hi> and the contrary
Party. And making these reflections, they a long time kept silence, hoping
<hi>Caesar</hi> would at last grant them something more, and change his Mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the pressing necessity. But he continuing silent as well as they;
and when his Friends besought him to say something more to them, and not
leave in suspence People that had served him so well, as he began to speak to
them, calling them <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> and not <hi>Fellow Soldiers,</hi> which is a sign he
looked upon them as discharged, they could not endure to be treated in
that manner, but interrupted him; and by their Cries testifying their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65196:185"/>
besought him to permit them to stay still in his Service; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he refused them, and descended from the Tribunal, they redoubled
their Cries, intreating him to stay and punish their fault. Hereupon he
stopped a good while, as if he had been in pain what to resolve on; and at
length remounting the Tribunal, told them he would not punish a Man;
but however, he was sorely troubled that the tenth Legion, whom he had
always preferred before the others, had begun this Mutiny: And to them
he added, <hi>I give you your Discharge, and will pay you what I promised you as
soon as I return from</hi> Africa: <hi>And at the end of the War I will give you Lands,
not as</hi> Sylla <hi>did; taking them from others, or mixing the Usurpers among those
are spoiled of them, to nourish perpetual Enmity between them; but I will divide
amongst you the Publick Lands, my own particular Inheritances; and if those be
not enough, I will buy more with my Money.</hi> Whereupon, all the rest with
Shouts and Acclamations applauded him, but the tenth Legion was quite
cast down, believing they should never regain <hi>Caesar</hi>'s favour; wherefore
they besought him to decimate them, according to the Custom of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors.
Till he, unwilling to afflict them any farther, because he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their Repentance serious, pardoned them as well as the rest; and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after departed to go for <hi>Africa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXI"/> From <hi>Rhegium,</hi> passing over to <hi>Messina,</hi> he came to <hi>Lylibaeum;</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that <hi>Cato</hi> with the Fleet and part of the Land Forces had the Guard
of <hi>Utica,</hi> where lay all the stores of the contrary Party, and where fate a
form of Senate, composed of three hundred persons, who had for some time
given orders in what concerned the War, and that <hi>L. Scipio</hi> their General
and the most considerable of the Party were at <hi>Adrumetum</hi> with the rest of
the Army, he went to land. There he had advice that <hi>Scipio</hi> was gone to
meet with King <hi>Iuba,</hi> wherefore he took the opportunity of his absence,
and drew up his Army before the Enemies Camp. <hi>Labienus</hi> and <hi>Petreius
Scipio</hi>'s Lieutenants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accepted the defiance and vigorously beat back <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
Men, driving them before them with contempt, till <hi>Labienus</hi>'s Horse
wounded in the Belly, having reversed and thrown him down, his Esquires
carried him out of the Fight, and <hi>Petreius</hi> contenting himself with having
tried the courage of his Soldiers, believing he could overcome whenever
he pleased, caused the Retreat to be sounded, saying to those about him,
<hi>We must not deprive</hi> Scipio <hi>our General of the honour of beating them himself.</hi>
Thus fortune shewed it self once more powerful for <hi>Caesar;</hi> for his Enemies
cooling in the midst of the Victory, let the whole fruit of it escape out
of their Hands. 'Tis said <hi>Caesar</hi> only stood his ground, all the rest fled, and
that with his own hand he was bringing back the Standard of a Legion to
the Front of the Battalia, when <hi>Petreius</hi> drew off into his Camp, in which
<hi>Caesar</hi> willingly imitated him. This was the success of the first Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Caesar</hi> met with in <hi>Africa.</hi> Some time after a rumour was spread,
that <hi>Scipio</hi> was coming with eight Legions, twenty thousand Horse, of which
the most part were Lybians, a great number of Targetiers, and thirty E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants,
and together with him King <hi>Iuba</hi> at the Head of thirty thousand
Footmen, twenty thousand Numidian Horse, store of Darters, and besides
all, sixty Elephants. The Soldiers were still disheartened with their late
disgrace, and the Enemy now seemed to them very formidable, both by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the number and valour of the Numidian Horse, besides they had
not been used to fight against Elephants, But when afterwards they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
that <hi>Bocchus</hi> another King of the Moors had seised upon <hi>Cirta,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence
of King <hi>Iuba,</hi> so that recalled by domestick Danger he had made a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65196:185"/>
speedy return into his Kingdom with his Army, leaving only with <hi>Scipio</hi>
the thirty Elephants, they took such heart, that the fifth Legion desired they
might be placed before the Elephants, and having obtained it, began the
Victory by the defeat of those Beasts, wherefore to this day they carry an
Elephant painted in their Colours; the Fight was for a long time stifly
maintained on both sides, till in the end <hi>Caesar</hi> remained victorious. <hi>Scipio</hi>'s
Camp was taken and pillaged, Night prevented the further pursuit of those
that fled, of whom every one shifted for himself as he best could, and <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
quitting all went away with <hi>Afranius</hi> by Sea in twelve open Boats. Thus
this Army composed of fourscore thousand fighting Men, the most part old
Soldiers, encouraged by the success of the first Fight were utterly defeated
in this one Battel, which augmented much the Glory of <hi>Caesar</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of his Enemies themselves, who attributed this Defeat more to his
good Fortune than their own remisness; but they slattered themselves, for
this misfortune arrived only by the fault of their Commanders, who had
not the prudence to spin out this war in length, whereby they might have
reduced <hi>Caesar</hi> (engaged in a strange Country) to want of Provisions; and
besides in not pursuing to the upshot their first Victory.</p>
               <p>Three days after the defeat, news thereof coming to <hi>Utica,</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXII"/>
it at the heels, all men disposed themselves to flight, <hi>Cato</hi> hindred no
Man, nay, he gave Ships to all such persons of quality as asked him, but for
himself he stood firm; and when those of <hi>Utica</hi> promised to entreat <hi>Caesar</hi> for
him before they did for themselves, he told them smiling he stood not in
need of any Intercessors, and <hi>Caesar</hi> knew it well. Afterwards
having put together what Money and Papers he had, he
sealed them up, and disposed them in the hands of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
of <hi>Utica,</hi> towards the Evening he bathed and supped, sitting
as he at other times used, since <hi>Pompey</hi>'s death; he altered not a jot of his
manner of living, but was served after his accustomed manner, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed
familiarly with his Servants. He talked of those that were gone, if
they had a good Wind, how far they might be off, and if they believed
that when <hi>Caesar</hi> came to morrow they would be got out of sight. When
he was going to Bed he let nothing extraordinary escape him, only he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
his Son with somewhat more tenderness, but not finding his Sword
near his Bed according to custom, he cryed out he was betrayed by his own
Domesticks, who had not left him wherewith to defend himself, if his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
assailed him by night; and when they besought him not to make
any attempt upon his life, but to repose without his Sword, he told them to
oblige them to believe him: <hi>If I had a mind to die, could not I knock my Head
against this Wall, or strangle my self with the Cloaths that I wear, or throw
my self headlong down, or stifle my self with stopping my Breath?</hi> With
these words and some others he perswaded them to lay his Sword in its
place, that done, he desired there might be brought him that Book <hi>Plato</hi>
writ concerning the Soul, which he read quite over, and when he thought
those who kept Guard at his door slept, he thrust his Sword into his Belly.
His Entrails coming out at the wound, some groan heard by those at the
door, obliged them to run in with Chyrurgions, who put his Entrails a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
still warm as they were into his Body, sowed up the wound, and after
having laid to it a Plaister, and rolled it up, his Senses being come to him,
he feigned to repent himself of the fault he had committed, thanked them
that they had helped him, and told them that now he stood in need of
some repose; but after they were gone, carrying with them his Sword, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65196:186"/>
had shut the Door that nothing might disturb his rest, whilst they thought
he slept he got off by little and little the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ller and Sewing of the Wound,
and pulling out his Entrails, tore them with his Fingers and Nails, and so
died in the fiftieth year of his age. He was esteemed the gravest and most
firm in his resolution of all men living, who judged not of what was just
and honest by what the people practised, but by strong and generous rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
He espoused <hi>Martia</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Philip,</hi> who had never before
been married, he loved her dearly, and had Children by her, and yet in
favour of the Friendship he bore to <hi>Hortensius,</hi> who had no Children, and
passionately desired to have one, he resigned her over to him till such time
as his Friend had a Son, and then took her home again, as if he had only
lent her: such was <hi>Cato.</hi> Those of <hi>Utica</hi> celebrated for him Magnificent
Funerals; and <hi>Caesar</hi> hearing the news of his death, said, Cato <hi>envyed the
Glory I might have got by doing a noble Action.</hi> And yet when <hi>Cicero</hi> wrote
a Book in praise of his death, and called it <hi>Cato, Caesar</hi> wrote another, and
called his Book <hi>Anticato.</hi> When <hi>Iuba</hi> and <hi>Petreius</hi> had heard what had
happened, and saw that they had neither hopes of flight or safety, they
slew each other with their Swords in a Chamber where they had eat toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>Caesar</hi> made the Kingdom of <hi>Mauritania</hi> tributary, and gave the
Government to <hi>Crispus Salustus.</hi> He pardoned those of <hi>Utica</hi> together with
<hi>Cato</hi>'s Son, and finding in that City a Daughter of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s with two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
he sent her to her Brother without doing her the least unkindness.
But he put to death all he could find of those three hundred which they
called a Senate. As for <hi>Lucius Scipio</hi> General of the defeated Army the
Waves cast him into the Enemies Fleet, from whence seeing no way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape,
he run his Sword through his Body, and threw himself into the Sea.
Thus <hi>Caesar</hi> ended the War in <hi>Africa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXIV"/> Being returned to the City he entred Triumphant over four several Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The first Triumph was over the Gauls, many of whose people he
had subdued and brought under the Roman Empire, and reduced to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
those that were revolted. The second over <hi>Pharnaces.</hi> The third
over the Africans that had taken up Arms for <hi>Scipio,</hi> wherein was led Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive
the Son of King <hi>Iuba,</hi> yet a Child who afterwards became an Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.
And the fourth, of the Egyptians defeated in a Fight by Water on the
<hi>Nile,</hi> but this Triumph was placed between the Gaul and the Pontick.
Though he triumphed not over the Romans because they were his Fellow
Citizens, which had been no Glory to him, and a shame to the Roman
People, yet in the pomp were carried Pictures of all those Defeats, and the
Pourtraictures of the Men, save only <hi>Pompey</hi>'s, which he durst not shew
because of the grief all men had for his loss, yet fresh in memory: yet the
people forbore not shedding tears for his misfortune, especially when they
knew <hi>L. Scipio</hi> General of a Roman Army, with his Breast wounded with
his own hand, precipitating himself into the Sea, and saw <hi>Petreius</hi> perish
in the Dining Room, and <hi>Cato</hi> tearing out his Bowels like a fierce Beast;
for <hi>Achillas</hi> and <hi>Photinus</hi> the sight of them was as pleasing as the flight of
<hi>Pharnaces,</hi> which made all the world laugh. 'Tis said that in these Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
they carried sixty thousand Talents and a half of Silver Money, with
two thousand eight hundred twenty two Crowns of Gold, weighing twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thousand four hundred and fourteen Pounds. He distributed to every
Soldier five thousand Attick Drams, to every Captain double, to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels
and Captains of Horse four times as much, and to all the people a
Mina by the Head; besides he exhibited divers pleasant Spectacles, Horse-racing,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65196:186"/>
Musick, Combats on Foot of a thousand against a thousand, on
Horseback of two hundred against two hundred, and another Fight of
Horse and Foot together, he made likewise twenty Elephants fight against
twenty, he represented likewise a Sea-Fight, wherein were four thousand
Rowers, and a thousand fighting Men on a side. He likewise caused a
Temple to be built to <hi>Venus,</hi> according to the vow he had made before the
Battel of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> and near to that Temple built a publick Hall for the
Roman People, not to use Traffick in, but for the pleading of Causes, and
to render justice, and learn how to render it, in like manner as there are
many in <hi>Persia,</hi> and by the Goddess side he caused to be set up the Statue of
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> which is to be seen to this day. And lastly, having taken the
number of the people, he found them one half less than they were at the
beginning of the War, so much had the Differences which had happened
between these two Men weakened the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>For himself being made the fourth time Consul, he undertook the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXIV"/>
of <hi>Spain</hi> against the young <hi>Pompey,</hi> which was a Remain of the
Civil War, he had not reason to slight; for all those people of Quality
that had escaped out of <hi>Africa</hi> got thither, and the Wracks of the Pharsali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
and African Defeats were here assembled, besides the assistance of the
most warlike Nations of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Celtiberia,</hi> and a great number of Slaves
that followed <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Army, who having been four years exercised to the
War, offered to serve him if he would try the fortune of a Battel. This was
the cause of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s overthrow; for that without delay he would go meet
<hi>Caesar,</hi> though the old Captains whom the Battels of <hi>Pharsalia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> had
made wiser, counselled him to prolong the War, being the only means to
ruine his Enemy, who could not subsist in a Country where he had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies;
for <hi>Caesar</hi> was come in seven and twenty days, counting from the
day he left the City, and with store of Baggage had performed a wonderful
Journey. Besides his Army never shewed less resolution out of the
thoughts possessed them, that they were to deal with a multitude of War-like
Enemies, and whom despair would make attempt any thing, which
was the reason <hi>Caesar</hi> made no haste to engage till <hi>Pompey</hi> provoking him to
Battel, reproached him with faintheartedness, which not able to endure,
he drew up his Army in Battel before <hi>Cordona,</hi> and that day he likewise
gave <hi>Venus</hi> for his Word, as Piety was that of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s. When the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were going to close, <hi>Caesar</hi> seeing his Men go on but coldly, and seem to
be afraid, invoked all the Gods, beseeching them with hands lifted up to
Heaven, not to let the lustre of so many glorious Actions be darkened in
one day, and running through the Ranks, encouraged his Soldiers, taking
off his Head-piece that he might be the better known. But do what he
could he could not raise their Spirits, till snatching a Buckler out of a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
hand, he said to the Tribunes were about him, <hi>This shall be the last day
of my life, and of your engagement to the War.</hi> And at the same time made
furiously towards the Enemy: he had scarce advanced ten foot but he had
above two hundred Darts thrown at him, some of which he avoided by
bending his Body, and others received on his Buckler, when the Tribunes
run with emulation to get about him, and the whole Army thereupon
charging with all their fury, they fought all day with divers advantage,
and at length towards the Evening the Victory fell to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and 'tis report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that hereupon he was heard say these words, <hi>That he had often fought
for Victory, but that now he had fought for life.</hi> After the Defeat, <hi>Pompey</hi>'s
Men flying into <hi>Cordona, Caesar,</hi> to prevent their escape thither, lest they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65196:187"/>
should rally and renew the Fight, caused the place to be invested by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
where his Soldiers being so tired they could not work in the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallation,
heaped up together the Bodies and Armour of the slain, which
they kept piled up with their javelins stuck into the ground, and lay all
night under that kind of Rampire. Next Morning the City was taken.
Of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Captains <hi>Scapula</hi> getting up on a Pile of Wood burnt himself;
the Heads of <hi>Varus, Labienus,</hi> and other persons of Quality were brought
to <hi>Caesar.</hi> As for <hi>Pompey</hi> he fled from the Battel with a hundred and fifty
Horse, bending his course towards <hi>Cartea</hi> where his Fleet lay, he entred
the Port in a Litter, and in the habit of a private Man. But seeing the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
had likewise lost all hopes, he threw himself into a little Boat, in which
as he was going out to Sea, his Foot tangling in the Cordage, one of his
people going to cut the Rope, by mischance cut his Heel, so that to cure his
wound he was forced to go ashore at a small Village, where hearing that
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s Horsemen were coming, he took his flight through a Country cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Thorns and Briars, which added to his wound, so that being tired,
and sitting down at last under a Tree, he was found by those gave him chase<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and slain, generously defending himself, his Head was carried to <hi>Caesar,</hi>
who caused it to be buried. Thus was this War ended by one only Fight,
contrary to the opinion of all the world. Those who escaped from this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat,
went to <hi>Pompey</hi>'s younger Brother, sirnamed <hi>Sextus,</hi> but he only
made War like a Rover, hiding himself, and flying from place to place.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXV"/> As for <hi>Caesar;</hi> having now put an end to all the Civil Wars, he returned
to <hi>Rome</hi> more powerful and glorious than ever any had been before him;
wherefore all imaginable Honours were done him to gain his favour. All
the Tribes, all the Nations and all the Kingdoms allyed and Friends to the
Roman People made Sacrifices, Shews and Offerings in every Temple, and
in every publick place, his Statues were every where to be seen set up in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
fashions, some adorned with Oaken Crowns, as having saved his
Country, like those wherewith the Citizens formerly honoured those who
saved their lives, likewise by publick Decree they gave him the Titles of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his Country, perpetual Dictator, Consul for ten years, and of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Sacred; and it was enacted, that he should administer Justice seated
on a Throne of Ivory, or of Gold, that he should wear the Triumphal
Robe at Sacrifices, that on those days whereon he had gained his
principal Victories publick Feasts and Prayers should be made, and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
five years the Priests and Vestals should offer up Vows for his safety;
that those who entred into office should swear not to oppose any of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and in Honour of his Birth-day they changed the name of the Month
which they called <hi>Quintilis,</hi> and named it <hi>Iuly.</hi> It was decreed likewise
by an Act of the Senate, that Temples should be built to him as to a God,
and among others one in common to him and Clemency, where their Statues
stood hand in hand. Thus by publick Vows they requested his Clemency,
whose Dominion they stood in aw of, some likewise there were who
would have called him King, but he forbid it with threats, signifying his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
for a name which could not but be unhappy after the execrations ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
by the Ancients against that Dignity, he likewise dismissed from
about his person the<note n="*" place="margin">Regiment of Guards.</note> Pretorian Cohorts, of which he had made use du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the War, and contented himself with the publick Officers. As he
gave audience, thus attended in the place, the Senate led by the Consuls
with the ordinary pomp came to present him those Edicts before spoken of,
he gave them every one his hand, but when they came in a Body rose not
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65196:187"/>
from his Seat, and suffered them to stand, which gave subject of discourse
to them who accused him of aiming at the Royalty. After having accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the other Honours, save only the Consulate for ten years, he designed
himself Consul for the next year with <hi>Anthony</hi> General of his Horse, and
gave <hi>Anthony</hi> for his Successor in the charge of his Horse, <hi>Lepidus,</hi> then
Governour of <hi>Spain</hi> who had his Lieutenants in that Province. He recalled
all Exiles except those who were banished for some great crime, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
all those of the contrary Faction, even many who had born Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him. At the same time he gave to some Offices for a year, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Governments of Provinces, or Armies to command, which gave the
people occasion to hope that he would restore the Government of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
as <hi>Sylla</hi> had done, who was mounted to the same power; but
those hopes appeared to be ill founded. After all this, one of those who
would confirm the rumour spread abroad concerning the Royalty, having
put upon the Head of one of his Statues a Wreath of Lawrel, interlaced
with white Ribbands, and the Tribunes of the People <hi>Marull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setius</hi>
having informed themselves of, discovered and imprisoned the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the Action, believing thereby to oblige <hi>Caesar,</hi> who seemed to take
amiss the speaking of the name of King, he approved their proceedings,
and when in the Assembly some saluting him gave him the Title of King,
perceiving the people shed tears, he pleasantly reproved them, by saying,
<hi>I am not King, but</hi> Caesar, as if they had mistaken one name for another;
but when <hi>Marullus</hi> issued out process against those had called him by that
name, and caused them to be brought before him by the Ushers as Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals,
he could not brook it, but complained to the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nate of <hi>Marullus</hi>
and his Colleagues, who out of malice gave him the reputation of affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Tyranny, adding they were worthy of death, but he would be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
that they were deprived of their Offices, and the quality of Senators.
This action confirmed the opinion of all the world, that he was glad to be
called so, that he might prove by degrees the minds of the people, and at
last mount to the Monarchy; for it was a crime to have called him a King,
and besides the Office of the Tribunes was hallowed and inviolable, by
Oath of the Ancients, and by old Laws, and besides they stayed not till the
time of their Magistracy (which approached) was expired, which
heightened the indignation of all good Men. And as soon as he perceived
it, he repented himself to have exercised his power with too much rigour,
as soon as he beheld himself in peace, and as some say, gave orders to his
Friends to govern themselves with prudence, because his Enemies had already
an occasion to do him hurt; whereupon they asking him if he would not
have the Spanish Cohorts continually about his person, he answered that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could be more miserable than to be perpetually guarded, nor any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of life be more uneasie: yet all this hindered not the endeavours of
those who would have had him take the Title of King. And as he was
Spectator at the Lupercal Ceremonies seated upon a Throne of Gold in
the place for Orations, <hi>Anthony</hi> his Colleague in the Consulate, running
about the City naked, and anointed with Oil (as is the custom for the
Priests of those Ceremonies) ascended the place where he sate, and plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Diadem on his Head. He laid it down as soon as he saw how few
people applauded the Spectacle; <hi>Anthony</hi> put it on once more, and he took
it off the second time. The people looked upon this Debate with silence,
impatient to see what would be the issue; but when they at last perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Caesar</hi> remained Master, the place was filled with Acclamations and
Prayers for his Prosperity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:65196:188"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXVI"/> After this, whether he lost all hopes, or that he grew weary of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit,
he quite gave over this design to avoid all envy, and that he might
leave the City, which he began to grow jealous of, because of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
or else for the better preservation of his health, never more afflicted
with the Falling Sickness and sudden Convulsions than when he lay idle, he
resolved upon a far distant Expedition against the Getes and the Parthians.
The Getes being a people hardened to labour, warlike and almost border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the Roman Empire, he resolved to prevent their attempts: and
for the Parthians he designed to revenge the Murder of <hi>Crassus,</hi> which they
had committed contrary to their Treaties. He therefore sent before six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Legions and ten thousand Horse which had passed the Adriatick Gulf,
and forthwith a rumour was spread, that there was an Oracle of the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byls
which declared that the Parthians could not be subdued by the Romans,
unless they were commanded by a King. This made some talk publickly
that in what concerned the Romans they might all call him Dictator or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
or some other softer name than that of King, but in regard of other
Nations taxed under the Roman Empire, there needed no scruple be made
at the giving him that Title. He having still refused it, hastened all he
could to get out of the City where many envied him. But four days before
the day appointed for his departure he was slain by his Enemies in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
either out of malice to see him raised to such supreme felicity and
height of Command, or else (as themselves said) out of a desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
the Common-wealth to its first Estate; for they feared after having
overcome these other Nations nothing could hinder him from making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
King: yet as it appears to me it was only for the name sake they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
all things; for in the thing it self there is no difference between
Dictator and King. There were two Chiefs of this Conspiracy, the Son
of that <hi>Brutus</hi> whom <hi>Sylla</hi> put to death, <hi>M. Brutus Cepio</hi> who came for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
to <hi>Caesar</hi> himself after the Battel of <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> and <hi>C. Cassius</hi> who
yielded to him the Galleys in the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> both of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Party, and
with them was joyned one of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s most intimate Friends <hi>Decimus Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Albinus.</hi> He had always treated them honourably, and with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
and when he was going to the War in <hi>Africa,</hi> had given them
Armies, and the Government of the Gauls, to <hi>Decimus Brutus</hi> of the
Transalpine, and to <hi>M. Brutus</hi> of the Cisalpine: <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> were
at this time designed Praetors, and were in difference for a jurisdiction,
which among the Citizens is accounted the most honourable of all others,
whether they contended out of ambition, or only feigned to do it, lest their
Conspiracy should be perceived: <hi>Caesar</hi> was Arbitrator between them,
and, as 'tis said, he acknowledged to his Friends that <hi>Cassius</hi> had reason, but
yet he would favour <hi>Brutus,</hi> so much he loved and honoured him, for
all men believed he was his Son, because he visited <hi>Servilia Cato</hi>'s Sister at
the time she grew with Child of <hi>Brutus,</hi> wherefore 'tis likewise said, that
in the Battel of <hi>Pharsalia</hi> he gave express order to his Captains to have a
great a care as possibly they could of <hi>Brutus</hi>'s life. However, whether he
were ingrateful, or knew nothing of it, or did not believe it, or that he
thought his Mother's incontinence a dishonou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, whether love of liberty
made him prefer his Country before his own Father, or being of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
race of the <hi>Bruti</hi> who had expelled the Kings, and now pricked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by the reproaches of the people, who on the Statues of the old <hi>Brutus,</hi>
and on this Praetor's Tribunal had secretly written such words as these, Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
<hi>thou sufferest thy self to be corrupted with gifts.</hi> Brutus <hi>thou art dead,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65196:188"/>
would to God thou wert now alive; either thy Successors degenerate, or thou hast
not begot them.</hi> He, I say, young as he was, chafed by these and such like
things, engaged himself in this Enterprize as an Act worthy his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.</p>
               <p>The Discourses concerning the Royalty were not then quite extinct, when
just as they were going to the Senate <hi>Cassius</hi> took <hi>Brutus</hi> by the hand, and
said, <hi>What shall we do if</hi> Caesar<hi>'s Flatterers propose to make him King?</hi> To
which <hi>Brutus</hi> answered, that <hi>He would not be at the Senate.</hi> Whereupon,
the other again demanded, <hi>What if they summon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s as Pretors, what shall we
do then, my Friend? I will,</hi> said he, <hi>defend my Country, even till death.</hi>
Whereupon, <hi>Cassius</hi> embracing him, said; <hi>And what Persons of Quality will
you take for Companions in so brave an Attempt? Do you think there are none
but Tavern-People and Artificers that put Writings on your Tribunal? Know
that they are the Prime Men of the City, who expect from other Pretors only
Plays and Shews; but require their Liberty from you, as the Work of your Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors.</hi>
Thus they discovered to each other what they had long had in
their thoughts; and began to try their own Friends, and some of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s,
according as they knew them capable of good things. They engaged in
their Design the two Brothers, <hi>Cecilius</hi> and <hi>Bucolianus, Rubrius Rex, Q. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius,
M. Spurius, Servilius Galba, Sextius Naso, Pontius Aquila:</hi> And
of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Friends they drew to their Conspiracy <hi>Decimus,</hi> of whom I have
already spoken; <hi>Caius Casca, Trebonius, Attilius Cimber, Minutius</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillus.</hi>
When they thought they had Companions enough, for it was not
convenient to communicate this Design to all the World, they gave their
Words one to another without either Oath or Sacrifice, and yet no one chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his mind, or ever discovered the Plot. There was nothing now want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but choice of time and place. The time urged, for within four days
<hi>Caesar</hi> was to depart and take Guards. For the place, they thought the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
most convenient; for they concluded that all the Senators, though they
were not made privy to it, yet, seeing the Action, would joyfully joyn with
them; which, as it is said, happened at the death of <hi>Romulus,</hi> after having
changed the Regal Power into Tyranny. Wherefore this Attempt would
have the same Success with that; especially, being not privily executed, but in
the Palace, and for the Good of the Commonwealth. That they needed
not to fear any thing from <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Army, being all composed of Roman
People; in conclusion, that the Authors of this great Action doing it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
could expect nothing but Reward. Having all decreed the Palace
for the place of Execution, there were divers Opinions concerning the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of doing it; some being of Opinion they should likewise make away
<hi>Anthony, Caesar</hi>'s Colleague, the most powerful of his Friends, and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
of the Soldiery. But <hi>Brutus</hi> opposed that; saying, That it was only
by killing <hi>Caesar,</hi> who was as a King, that they ought to seek for the Glory of
destroying Tyrants; and that if they killed his Friends too, Men would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
the Action to private Enmity, and the Faction of <hi>Pompey.</hi> This Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
prevailing, they only expected the assembling of the Senate. Now
the day before <hi>Caesar</hi> being invited to sup with <hi>Lepidus,</hi> carried along with
him <hi>Decimus Brutus Albinus:</hi> and during Supper the Question being propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
what Death was best for Man; some desiring one kind, and some ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he alone preferred the suddainest and most unexpected. Thus divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
for himself, they fell to discourse of the Morrows Affairs. In the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
finding himself somewhat out of Order with the Night's Debauch, and
his Wife <hi>Calphurnia</hi> having been frightned with dismal Dreams, she advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him not to go abroad; and in many Sacrifices he made, there were
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65196:189"/>
none but affrightful Tokens: He therefore gave order to <hi>Anthony</hi> to dismiss
the Senate. But <hi>Decimus Brutus</hi> perswading him that it was more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
he went himself, to avoid the Opinion might be conceived, he did it out
of Pride or Scorn, he went to dismiss them himself, coming to the Palace
in his Litter. There were at present Plays in <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Theatre, and almost
all the Senators were at the Windows of the Neighbouring Houses, as is the
Custom in the time of Spectacles. The same Morning the Pretors, <hi>Brutus</hi>
and <hi>Cassius,</hi> gave Audience to those made Suit for it, with great tranquillity,
in a Gallery before the Theatre. But when they had heard what happened
to <hi>Caesar</hi> in the Sacrifices, and that therefore they deferred the Senate, they
were much troubled. One of those that stood there having taken <hi>Casca</hi> by
the hand, told him; <hi>You kept it close from me that am your Friend but</hi> Brutus
<hi>has told me all.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Casca</hi> pricked in Conscience, began to tremble;
but the other continuing with a smile; <hi>Where then will you raise the Money
to come to the Edility? Casca</hi> gave him an Account. <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
being talking together, one of the Senators, called <hi>Popilius Laena,</hi>
drawing them aside, said; <hi>I pray God what you have in your hearts may suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
happily, but it is fit you make haste.</hi> At which they were so surprized,
that they gave him no Answer. At the same time that <hi>Caesar</hi> went to the
Palace in his Litter, one of his Domesticks who had understood something
of the Conspiracy, came to find <hi>Calphurnia;</hi> but without saying any thing
else to her but that he must speak with <hi>Caesar</hi> about Affairs of importance, he
stayed expecting his Return from the Senate, because he did not know all
the Particulars: His Host of <hi>Gnidus</hi> called <hi>Artemidorus</hi> running to the Palace
to give him notice of it, came just at the moment of his being killed; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as he sacrificed before the Gate of the Senate-House, gave him a Note
of all the Conspiracy; but he going in without reading it, it was after his
death found in his hands. As he came out of his Litter, <hi>Laena,</hi> the same
who before had spoken to <hi>Cassius,</hi> came to him, and entertained him a long
time in private; which struck a Damp into the Chiefs of the Conspiracy,
the more because their Conference was long: They already began to make
signs to one another, that they must now kill him before he arrested them;
but in the Sequel of the Discourse, observing <hi>Laena</hi> to use rather the Gesture
of a Suppliant than an Accuser, they deferred it; till in the end, seeing him
return thanks to <hi>Caesar,</hi> they took Courage. It is the Custom of the Chief
Magistrates entring the Palace, first to consult the Divines; and here as
well as in the former Sacrifices, <hi>Caesar</hi>'s first Victim was found without a
heart, or as some say without the Chief of the Entrails. The Divine here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
telling him it was a mortal Sign, he replyed laughing, that when he
went to fight against <hi>Pompey</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> he had seen the like: and the other
having replyed, that then likewise he had run hazard of losing his Life; but
that at present the Entrails threatned him with greater danger. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
they should sacrifice another Victim, which fore-boding nothing
but ill; he fearing to seem tedious to the Senate, and being pressed by his
Enemies, whom he thought to be his Friends, without considering the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
entred the Palace; for it was of necessity that the Misfortune to befall
him, should befal. They left <hi>Trebonius</hi> at the Gate to stop <hi>Anthony</hi> under
pretence of discoursing some Business with him; and as soon as <hi>Caesar</hi> was
seated, the other Conspirators surrounded him according to Custom, as
Friends, having each his Dagger concealed. At the same time <hi>Attilius
Cimber</hi> standing before him, began to intreat him to grant the Return of his
Brother who was in Exile; and upon his Refusal, under pretence of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
it with more humility, he took him by the Robe; and drawing it to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65196:189"/>
him, hung about his Neck, crying out, <hi>Why do you delay, my Friends.</hi>
Thereupon <hi>Casca</hi> first of all reaching over his Head, thought to strike his
Dagger into his Throat, but wounded him only in the Breast. <hi>Caesar</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
disengaged himself from <hi>Cimber,</hi> and caught hold of <hi>Casca</hi>'s hand, leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his Seat, and threw himself upon <hi>Casca</hi> with a wonderful force;
but being at Handy Gripes with him, another struck his Dagger into his
Side, <hi>Cassius</hi> gave him a Wound in the Face, <hi>Brutus</hi> struck him quite through
the Thigh, <hi>Bucolianus</hi> wounded him behind the Head; and he like one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
and roaring like a Savage Beast, turned sometimes to one and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to another; till strength failing him after the Wound received from
<hi>Brutus,</hi> he threw the Skirt of his Robe over his Face, and suffered himself
gently to fall before <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Statue. They forbore not to give him many
Stabs after he was down, so that there were three and twenty Wounds
found in his Body. And those that slew him were so eager, that some of
them through vehemence, without thinking of it, wounded each other.</p>
               <p>After this Murder committed in a Hallowed Place, and on a Sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXVII"/>
all the Assembly took their Flight, both within the Palace, and without
in the City. In the Croud there were several Senators wounded, and some
killed: There were slain likewise other Citizens and Strangers; not with
design, but without knowing the Authors, as happens in a publick Tumult;
for the Gladiators, who were armed in the Morning to give Divertisement
to the People, ran from the Theatre to the Senators Houses; the Spectators
affrighted, dispersed as fast as their Legs would carry them, the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
exposed to Sale were made Plunder of, the Gates were shut, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
got upon the Roofs of their Houses to secure themselves from Violence.
<hi>Anthony</hi> fortifyed himself in his House, judging they had a design upon his
Life as well as upon <hi>Caesar</hi>'s: And <hi>Lepidus,</hi> General of the Horse, hearing
upon the place what had passed, made haste to the Island in the River,
where he had a Legion; which he drew into the Field of <hi>Mars,</hi> that he
might be in readiness to execute the Orders of <hi>Anthony;</hi> for he yielded to
him, both in the Quality of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Friend and Consul. The Soldiers would
very willingly have revenged <hi>Caesar</hi>'s death so basely murdered, but that
they feared the Senate, who favoured the Murderers, and expected the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
of things. <hi>Caesar</hi> had no Soldiery with him, for he loved not Guards;
but contented himself with Ushers: Besides, he was accompanied with a
great number of People of the Robe, and whole Troops of as well Citizens
as Strangers, with Freed Men and Slaves, followed him from his House to the
Palace; but in a moment all these Crouds were vanished, there remained
with him only three unhappy Slaves; who putting him in his Litter, and
taking it upon their Shoulders, carried him, who but a little before was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
both of Sea and Land. The Conspirators after the Execution had a mind
to have said something in the Senate; but no body staying to hear them, they
twisted their Robes about their left Arms instead of Bucklers, and with
thier bloody Daggers in their Hands, ran through the Streets, crying out,
they had slain the King and the Tyrant; causing to march before them a
Man carrying a Cap on the Head of a Pike, which is the Badge of Liberty:
they exhorted likewise the People to the restoring the Commonwealth;
putting them in mind of the first <hi>Brutus,</hi> and the Oath wherein he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
the Citizens, and with them their Posterity. There were several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who were not of the Conspiracy, who took Daggers, and went with
them through the City; of the number of which were <hi>Lentulus Spinther,
Favonius, Aquinius, Dolobella, Murius</hi> and <hi>Petiscus;</hi> who, instead of the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65196:190"/>
Honour they expected, received the same Punishment with those had been
guilty; but none of the People joyned with them, which begot in them
both trouble and fear. As for the senate, though all the Senators who knew
not of the Plot had in the Tumult taken their Flight, yet they hoped well
from them, either because they were Kindred or Friends to most of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
or because they knew they themselves had an aversion for the Tyranny;
but they had an ill Opinion of the People, and of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Soldiers, of whom
there were great numbers in the City; some newly dismissed, to whom he
had given Lands; others distributed by Colonies some time before, who
were returned to follow him: They were likewise fearful of <hi>Lepidus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was Master of the Legion of the City; and doubted lest <hi>Anthony,</hi>
against the Authority of the Senate, should engage the People to destroy
them. Things being in this posture, they with the Gladiators seized the
Capitol; where in their first Consultation it was agreed that they should
tempt the People with Gifts; for they hoped that some of the People begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to praise the Action, others would follow their Example out of love to
Liberty, and desire the restore the Commonwealth; and they imagined that
the Roman People were still the same as they had heard tell they were in the
time of first <hi>Brutus,</hi> who drave out the Kings: but they considered not
that they des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mselves be corrupted with Gifts; the last of which was
much easier to be hoped for in a Commonwealth long since depraved, for
the Multitude of the City was mixed with all sorts of Strangers; the Freed
Men lived equal to the other Citizens, the Slave was habited like his Master,
and except the Habit of the Senators, one Fashion was used indifferently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all the rest. Moreover, because of the Corn distributed to the Poor
in the City only, all Loyterers, Beggars, and People unskilful in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions
throughout all <hi>Italy</hi> flocked the <hi>Rome:</hi> Besides, there were great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of disbanded Soldiers who returned not as formerly every one to his
Country; but expecting to be sent to possess the Houses and Lands of others,
quartered together by Bands in Temples and Galleries, under only one Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
and one Captain, who was to be their Conductor to their Colony.
These People, after having sold all that they had, to be the lighter to march,
were ready to do any thing for Money: So that the Conspirators had no
great difficulty to gather together a multitude in the place. But though they
were payed for it, they durst not praise the Action out of the respect they
bore to the Glory of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and the fear they stood in of the Contrary Party;
but as if they had in view the Publick Good, they cryed out for Peace, and
demanded it of the Magistrates; and by this means they laboured for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of the Conspirators, Peace not being to be had without an Act of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion.
Thereupon <hi>Cinna,</hi> allyed to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and then Pretor, joyns with
them: And advancing into the midst of them contrary to the expectation
of all the World, threw off his Praetor's Robe, despising it as being given
him by a Tyrant: After which he began to declaim against <hi>Caesar,</hi> calling
him Tyrant, and those who had slain him Tyrannicides; highly praising
their Action, as parallel to what their Predecessors had done; and at the
same time commanding they should bring from the Capitol those brave
People who had so well served the Commonwealth, to the end to give them
those Rewards they had merited. But whatever Command <hi>Cinna</hi> gave,
this Troop seeing, the People who had not been corrupted were not there,
would not let them be brought, but contented themselves to continue their
Cries in demanding Peace. But when <hi>Dolobella,</hi> a Young Man of great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
whom <hi>Caesar</hi> ready to depart, had designed Consul for the rest of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65196:190"/>
the Year, being come with his Purple and the Badges of the Consulate, and
had spoke after <hi>Cinna</hi> violently and with indignation against the Author of
his Dignity, pleading hard for the Pardon of a Crime of which he said he
would himself have been Partaker of, and proposing (as some say) to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
that Day as the Day of the Foundation of their City. Then this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of Mercenary People took Courage, seeing a Pretor and a Consul
seemed to Authorize them, and they sent to tell the Conspirators they should
come down from the Temple. They were glad to hear what <hi>Dolobella</hi> had
done, believing they had now at need found a Consul young, vigorous, and
of a good Family, to oppose against <hi>Anthony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet only <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> came down, the Hand of the last all bloody <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXVIII"/>
with a Wound he had received from the former when they stabbed <hi>Caesar.</hi>
Being come to the Assembly, neither one nor the other said any thing mean
or low; they praised each other for what they had done, as if it had been
an Action of Honour by consent of all the World: They declared that upon
it depended the Prosperity of the City, which was this day made happy;
gave a glorious Testimony of the Prudence of <hi>Decimus Brutus,</hi> who had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
opportunely called to them the Gladiators, exhorted the People to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
their Predecessors, who drove out their Kings that had not made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Kings by force as <hi>Caesar</hi> had, but were lawfully elected; and advised
them to send for <hi>Pompey,</hi> the Son of the great <hi>Pompey,</hi> Defender of the
Commonwealth, against whom <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Party yet made War in <hi>Spain;</hi> and
that they should order the Return of <hi>Caesetius</hi> and <hi>Marullus,</hi> Tribunes of the
People, whom <hi>Caesar</hi> had interdicted their Offices, and sent into Banishment,
where they still remained. Having spoken to this purpose, they again went
up to the Capitol, for they durst not confide in this Multitude. But their
Servants and Relations being already permitted to go and come to and from
the Temple, they chose some whom they deputed to <hi>Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Anthony,</hi>
to entreat them to make Peace, to maintain Liberty, and secure their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
from the Miseries attend on Discord. To obtain this, the Deputies
praised not the Action (for they durst not, speaking to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Friends) but
they said, that in their judgments it ought to be born with; that those had
done it were worthy of Pardon, having undertaken it not out of any hate
they bore him, but love to their Country. That the Condition of the City
was deplorable, if being almost depopulated by the Seditions wherewith it
had a long time been afflicted, they would not spare those few good Citizens
left. That it was extremely unjust to run the Commonwealth in hazard of
utter Ruin for particular Enmities; and that instead of laying hold of this
Occasion to gratifie their Hatred, they ought to sacrifice to the
good of the Estate all the Offences they might possibly have received. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
and <hi>Lepidus</hi> wanted not Will to revenge <hi>Caesar</hi>'s death, but they were
fearful of the Kindred and Friends of the Conspirators, and the Affection
the Senate bore them; and above all, of <hi>Decimus Brutus.</hi> who with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
held the Neighbouring <hi>Gaul,</hi> of which <hi>Caesar</hi> had given him the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Wherefore they thought it more expedient to wait for a more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Opportunity, and in the mean time try all ways they could to draw
<hi>Decimus</hi> Army, already well wearied, to their Party. So <hi>Anthony</hi> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them in these Terms.</p>

               <p>Having made them this Answer, they thanked them, and returned with
great hopes all things would succeed to their satisfaction, for they promised
themselves the Senate would heartily espouse their Interest. But <hi>Anthony</hi>
commanded to Magistrates to keep Watch by Night in the City, and to take
by turns their Seat in the Tribunal as in Broad Day; having to that purpose
given Orders to kindle Fires in all the Streets. The Friends of the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
ran all Night from House to House to solicite the Senators to be favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to them, and to watch for the Good of their Country. On the
other side, the Chiefs of the Soldiers destined for the Colonies ran up
and down also, making strange threats if they did not send them to
the Lands already given them, and those that were farther promised them.
Moreover, the Citizens who would not be corrupted, hearing of the
small number of the Conspirators, took heart; and calling to mind the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Qualities of <hi>Caesar,</hi> could not agree with the others. The same Night
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s Treasure and Writings were brought to <hi>Anthony</hi>'s, either at <hi>Calphur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>'s
desire for their greater security, or that <hi>Anthony</hi> commanded it. As
soon as it was Day, the Senate was called by Order of the Consul in the
Temple of<note n="*" place="margin">Tetra.</note> 
                  <hi>The Earth,</hi> which was near to his House; for the durst not go to
the Palace because it was under the Capitol, whither the Conspirator were
retired with the Gladiators; nor would trouble the City by making the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my enter, which yet <hi>Lepidus</hi> brought in. At Break of Day came with the
other Senators to the Temple of <hi>The Earth Cinna,</hi> having resumed the same
Habit which the Day before he had cast away, as given him by a Tyrant:
Some of the Citizens who had born Arms under <hi>Caesar</hi> perceiving him, enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
that he who was his Kins-man had been the first who had blemished his
Reputation by a malicious Speech, began to throw Stones at him; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
forced him to shelter himself in a certain House, brought Wood round
about it to burn him in it, if <hi>Lepidus,</hi> coming in with the Army, had no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
hindred it; which raised the Spirits of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Party, and appalled the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries
and Conspirators.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXIX"/> In the Senate all dis-interessed Persons condemned the Action, but the
greater part took divers ways to oblige the Conspirators; and were of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that before any thing else were done, they should come and take their
places in the Assembly, having acted fairly, to the end, that from Accused,
they might become Judges: Which <hi>Anthony</hi> did not oppose, knowing well
there was no likelihood of their coming, as indeed they did not. To try
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65196:191"/>
then the inclination of the Senate, some with vehemence praised the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, giving to those had done it the Title of Tyrannicides, and voting them
rewards; others without speaking of reward, which indeed they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
demanded not, were of advice only thanks should be given them, as
having done by it good service to the Common-wealth, and others quite
cutting off the Complements, said, that what they had done was pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Thus they argued, to see on which side the Senate leaned, that they
might better propose the rest. Thereupon the honestest and best men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
detested the Assassinate as an execrable crime, yet said, that they would
not hinder, but in consideration of the Families of the Guilty, which were
of the best of the City; they should be granted impunity, but they could
never suffer them to be honoured, as having well served the State: others
on the contrary said, they ought to be granted all other things, with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
of their persons. Some one having thereupon said, that the Honour
done to them would defame <hi>Caesar:</hi> another replyed, that they should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
consider the living than the dead; whereupon another resolutely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
that they must declare <hi>Caesar</hi> Tyrant, or give them their lives out of
pure Grace, all the rest holding to this point required the question to be put
what judgment they were to make of <hi>Caesar.</hi> After having first every man
swore they would sincerely speak their thoughts, without respect to former
Oaths, which necessity had forced from them; for since he became Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Common-wealth they had lost their liberty, and only spoke in
fear, lest they should perish like <hi>Pompey</hi> and a thousand others. <hi>Anthony,</hi>
who observed them conceived presently their imaginations, and judging
that in this matter many true things might be said that would cumber and
perplex him, thought it best to divert them from this design, by making
them believe they acted against themselves; wherefore knowing that the
greatest part of those who talked in this manner had received their Patents
and Commissions for Magistracies, and Government of Armies from <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
himself; (for being designed upon very long Expedition, he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed of all dignities for five years) he commanded silence as Consul,
and then spoke to this effect:</p>
               <q>
                  <floatingText xml:lang="unk">

                           <p>IT's necessary those who purpose to advise any thing concerning <hi>Caesar,</hi> should
know, that if he have governed the Common-wealth as a lawful Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
all he has done ought to be approved: but if he have reigned as a Tyrant,
his Body is to be thrown into the common Sewer, and all he has done revoked.
Now (to say all in a word) the whole Universe is concerned in what
he has enacted: nay, some things he has done, which though we would, it were
not possible for us to disannul, which I will let you fully understand in the sequel
of this discourse. At present I will only in the first place put the question to
you concerning things that are in our power, and which concern our selves alone,
from whence you may give an easie conjecture what order is to be observed in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of more difficulty. Almost all of us here present have exercised or do exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
Offices, to which we have been nominated by <hi>Caesar;</hi> and some there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
by himself to possess them for the future; for you know that he has for
five years disposed of all the annual Dignities of the City, the Governments of
Provinces, and Command of Armies, if you will all voluntarily lay them down,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65196:192"/>
that is in your power, therefore let us first of all consult of that, and then I
will speak what remains.</p>

                  </floatingText>
               </q>
               <p>Having by these words let them know, that they ought rather to think
of themselves than of <hi>Caesar,</hi> he was silent, and at the same time they all
began to cry out with one voice, rising up from their Seats, That there
was no necessity of giving the people the trouble of calling new Assemblies,
for the nomination of Magistrates, and that it was much better, every
one should hold the Dignities they had already accepted. Many were the
more vehement in this, because they could promise themselves nothing from
the Assembly, being under age, among whom the Consul <hi>Dolobella</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
was the principal, for being yet but five and twenty years of age, he
could not obtain the Consulate without violating the Laws. So the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
inclinations of the day were changed in a moment, many crying out
aloud that it would be a shameful thing, if to favour Murderers, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their impunity more glorious, Magistrates should be deprived of their
Dignities: others on the contrary endeavoured to perswade <hi>Dolobella</hi> and
the rest, that they might hope for all things from the people, who would
name them to the same Dignities, and that there would be no change of the
persons designed, but only the form of Assemblies lawfully held, instead of
those overawed by the tyranny, besides it would be more honourable for
them not to be esteemed less worthy those Honours, after the restoring the
Common-wealth, than under the Monarchy. As soon as they heard these
Discourses, some Praetors deposed their Ornaments, and the marks of their
Dignities on the Benches of the Authors of this opinion, in hopes to receive
them more legitimately with the others, but the greater part being doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of the snare, believed, if they once let go what they had in their hands,
they should never catch it again.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XL"/> Mean while <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Lipidus</hi> went out of the Senate into the place
where some were assembled, and demanded their presence; when they
saw them coming from above, they began to cry out in confusion, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
with much trouble, they were silenced, one of them, whether of his
own motion, or suborned, cryed out, that they should prevent the Cities
falling into the like calamities which they had formerly suffered. Then
<hi>Anthony</hi> opening his Robe, shewed his Corslet underneath to incense the
multitude as if the life of the Consul himself were not secure without
Arms. Thereupon some crying out, that the crime ought to be punished,
and others demanding pardon for the guilty, and peace: he said to these,
<hi>As for peace, we will consider of the ways to make it so that it may last; for it is
very hard to find securities for it, since the Oaths made to</hi> Caesar, <hi>and those with
execrations against those that violated them, were in vain.</hi> Then turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to those required vengeance for this Murder, having praised them as
the more religious observers of Faith and Piety, he added these words, <hi>I
would put my self at the head of you, and first of all my self cry the same thing
if I were not Consul, but my charge obliges me to do not so much what is just,
as what is advantageous to the Common-wealth; for so it is ordained by all those
in the Palace, though that has been the loss of</hi> Caesar, <hi>who pardoning those he
had overcome in favour of the publick Good, has been murdered by themselves.</hi>
After these artificial Discourses made by <hi>Anthony</hi> to each Party, those who
were for revenging the Murder, would have <hi>Lepidus</hi> undertake to execute
the vengeance; and when he began to speak to them, the multitude who
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65196:192"/>
were too far off, cryed out, that he should come down unto the middle of
the place, that the people might more easily hear him; whereupon think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there might be some change in the minds of the people, he came to the
Tribunal for Orations, where with tears in his eyes, he before all the world
deplored the misfortune arrived to <hi>Caesar;</hi> and in the end added, <hi>I was ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday
with</hi> Caesar <hi>in this very place, where today I am forced to demand your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of his death, what would you have me do!</hi> To which many crying out,
<hi>Let him be revenged.</hi> The Mercenaries on the contrary cryed out, <hi>Peace.</hi>
To whom he answered, <hi>We would with all our hearts; but what peace can we
make? or upon what Oaths can it be secured, since there are none so sacred by
which we have not sworn to</hi> Caesar, <hi>and yet they have all been violated by those
whom we thought good Men?</hi> Then turning to the others; <hi>Our</hi> Caesar (said
he) <hi>is dead, that person truly sacred, that adorable Man, and we are fearful
his death will cause some great misfortune to the Common-wealth, but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
will consider of it, and the most part of them are of advice to take order in it.</hi>
Whereupon they began again to cry, <hi>Do you alone do that. I would,</hi> said he,
<hi>and can alone undertake it, but it is not sufficient that you and I would or do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
it alone.</hi> Upon these artificial contests, the Mercenaries knowing
him inflamed with ambition, praised him, and offered him the High Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Caesar,</hi> which he listened to with much joy, and told them, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what you offer me another time if you thing me worthy of it.</hi> The
hopes he conceived of this Priesthood having given him the boldness to ask
with more instance for peace, he told them, <hi>Though reason and Iustice for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
it, I will do what you desire.</hi> After which words he returned with speed
to the Palace, where in the interim <hi>Dolobella</hi> had shamefully consumed all
that time in endeavouring to have himself confirmed in the Consulate. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
who expected what the people would do, beheld that with derision;
and because there was great difference of opinion, contented himself to be
a Spectator; in the end seeing the people were not heated with all these
things, he resolved to consent to the impunity of the Conspirators, because
indeed he saw himself constrained to it, yet dissembling the necessity, he let
them understand, that in sparing their lives he did them a great favour;
and as to what concerned <hi>Caesar,</hi> he undertook to cause all he had done to
be ratified and confirmed by Decree. So Commanding silence he began to
speak in this manner:</p>

                           <p>WHilst you debated, Gentlemen, about the crime committed by our Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
I gave you nothing of my opinion, and when you put it to the
question, and took votes concerning <hi>Caesar,</hi> I proposed you but one thing of all
he had done, which extremely perplexed you, and not without reason, for if
we lay down our charges, we tacitly confess that we and so many great men are
unworthy. Let us now consider the other things, which it is not easie to express.
In so great a number of Cities, Provinces, Kings and Potentates (for almost
all the people which <hi>Caesar</hi> has subdued by his valour and his Forces from the
East to the West have received his Laws, and are obliged to his liberality and
favour.) Can you believe any of them will suffer what they possess to be taken
away, at any less rate than blowing up the Flames of War in all parts? you who
think it it convenient to save wicked men because the Common-wealth is weak
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65196:193"/>
and impotent. I will not speak of people far distant, whom fear hath hitherto
kept within the bounds of duty. Regard not only our Neighbours, but those who
dwell among us in <hi>Italy,</hi> those old Soldiers who have received from <hi>Caesar</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of those Victories for which they exposed their lives. They are still in
Bodies, and armed, and there are many thousands of them in the City: what
think you they would do, if what was given be taken from them? Will they
wait for other Colonies and other Lands? You may conjecture by what you saw
last night; for as you went through the City to solicite for the guilty, you know
how they threatened you: think you they will stand quietly, and see <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
Body unworthily dragg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

enact that Tyrants should be so treated) do you think it would not move them
who have fought under him? or that they can hope you will let them enjoy the
rewards of those Victories they have gained against the Gauls and Britains, whilst
with the extremest of infamy you treat him from whom they hold them? What
will the people of <hi>Rome?</hi> what will all the people of <hi>Italy</hi> do? will you not
draw upon your won heads the hatred and indignation of men and gods, if you
condemn to that punishment him who has extended the bounds of your Empire
from the Ocean to Nations before unknown? Will not all the world say we are
unjust Iudges, if we decree rewards for those, who in the Palace, in a hallowed
place, in full Senate, being Senators themselves, murdered a Consul, a sacred
person, and defame him, who for his Virtue his very Enemies have in venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
wherefore let me counsel you not to think of these things, which are neither
just nor possible; and as my opinion I declare it, that we ought to ratifie all that
<hi>Caesar</hi> has done and ordained, and not approve the action of those who slew him;
for that is neither just nor reasonable, and cannot be done with cancelling all he
had done; notwithstanding if you think good, let their lives be saved out of pure
grace for the sake of their Kindred and Friends, upon condition they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the obligation.</p>

               <p>After these words of <hi>Antonies,</hi> there was great contest in the Senate,
and in the end it was agreed by the consent of all the Senatours, that there
should be no prosecution of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s death, and that all that he had done should
be approved for the good of the Publick, which words were added by the
Conspirators Friends for their greater security. <hi>Anthony</hi> himself not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
it, as if he approved it, rather for the common Quiet than out
of Justice. Hereupon those possessed of Charges, began to demand men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should be made of them as well as of the publick interest, and they
confirmed in their Dignities, to which <hi>Anthony</hi> likewise consented, letting
the Fathers know he did it for fear, and to this Decree was added another,
concerning the Colonies.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLI"/> The Senate being risen, some gathered about <hi>L. Piso</hi> in whose hands
<hi>Caesar</hi> had deposited his last Will and Testament, to desire him not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
it, nor to make any publick Funerals, lest that should occasion new
Tumults, which when they could not obtain, they threatened to summon
him to Judgment, because he thereby frustrated the Publick of a great
estate which ought to be brought to the Treasury, and something they said
concerning Tyranny, whereupon <hi>Piso</hi> called out as loud as he could, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching
the Consuls to reassemble the Senate, who were not yet separated,
and then he told them:</p>

a High Priest, they threaten those entrusted with his Will, they say his Goods
ought to be confiscated, as if he had been a Tyrant, they would have what he has
done ratified as far as it respects them; but where it concerns himself they would
disannul it; and 'tis not <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> who do this, but those who stirred
them up to commit this murder. Do you consult concerning his Funerals; and

               <p>These words raised a Tumult and Indignation, especially in the minds of
those who hoped to have some advantage to themselves by the Will. It
was therefore agreed the Will should be published, and publick Funerals
solemnized; and so the Senate parted. <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> understanding
what had passed, sent to invite the people to come up to the Capitol, where
a great multitude being assembled, <hi>Brutus</hi> spoke in these terms:</p>
               <q>

Enemies calumniously accuse us, of having violated our Faith, and troubled the

After that <hi>Caesar</hi> upon his return from <hi>Gaul</hi> entred armed into his Country,
and <hi>Pompey</hi> who loved the Common-wealth had been treated as you all know,
and after a great multitude of good Citizens retired into <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> were
perished, the tyranny being established, he would, and not without reason, for his

us to promise upon oath not only to blot out of our remembrance the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
we had received, but likewise to live under him in perpetual servitude, what
would not then those have done who sought our destruction? But I believe for my
part there is not true Roman who would not chuse rather to die an hundred times
than oblige himself by oath to servitude. If then <hi>Caesar</hi> attempted nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our liberty, we are perjured; but if he has left to us neither the disposition
of Offices in the City, nor of Governments of Provinces, nor Command of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
nor Colonies, nor any other Honours, but that <hi>Caesar</hi> alone disposed all
these things without so much as speaking a word to the Senate, or asking the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the people, where is that liberty of which we had not so much as the hopes
left? for could we think he would be weary of our servitude, or would imitate
<hi>Sylla,</hi> who after being revenged of his Enemies, restored to you the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Common-wealth, he who undertaking so long an Expedition, antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65196:194"/>
for five years the assembly for election of Magistrates? What shall I
say of the Tribunes of the people, <hi>Caesctius</hi> and <hi>Marullus?</hi> did he not shameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
drive away those Magistrates holy and inviolable? The Laws and Oath of our
Fathers permit not the Tribunes of the people to be brought to judgment so
long as they are in Office, but <hi>Caesar</hi> has judged them, has banished them; who
then, he or we, have violated the reverence due to persons holy and sacred? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
possibly <hi>Caesar</hi> was hallowed and inviolable, he whom by violence, after the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of his Country and the death of so many great Men, we honoured with
that Title, and the power of the Tribunes be not hallowed and inviolable, after
that our Fathers when the Common-wealth was free, voluntarily swore them so,
and pronounced execrations against their posterity if they violated it. Whither
was the wealth and riches of the Empire brought? to whom did the Receivers
give their Accounts? who broke up the Treasury against our will? who laid hands
on a Fond never any before durst touch? and who threatened a Tribune with
death that opposed it? But say they upon what Oaths can we be assured the peace
now to be made shall not be violated? I will answer them, that if no person by a
a Tyrant, there needs no Oaths, and our Predecessors never took any. But if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one aspire to the Tyranny the Romans ought not to observe either Faith or Religion with Tyrants. We tell you all these things in the midst of our present
danger, and will never cease to speak them for the publick Good; for when <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
conferred on me all imaginable Honours, I always preferred my Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my own proper Glory. They slander us about the Colonies to incense you;
but if there be any here who have taken possession of Lands already assigned to
them, or are ready to go, let them do me the favour to make themselves known
to me.</p>
                           <p>Thereupon many having made a Sign.</p>
                           <p>You have done well, (<hi>said he</hi>) to come hither with the other Citizens; and
surely it is but just that you do participate, and so are willing to participate equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Honours of the City, you testifie likewise the affection you bear your
Country. The Roman People gave you to <hi>Caesar</hi> to bear Arms in <hi>Gaul</hi> and
<hi>Britain,</hi> having served him well you have merited Honours and Military Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but he after having exacted an Oath from you, led you whether you would
or no, both against the City, and against the most eminent Citizens in <hi>Africa;</hi>
possibly you are ashamed to demand a salary for the services you have done in
these last Wars; but because neither envy, time, nor oblivion can blot out those
noble Actions you did in <hi>Gual</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> you are sure to receive those rewards
the people of <hi>Rome</hi> do customarily give their Soldiers. But they for that end
never robbed innocent people, nor divided others Goods to those that served them;
but when they had overcome their Enemies, seised not of all their Country, but a
part of their Lands, whither they sent the Veterans to inhabit, and to keep the
subdued people in awe; and if the conquered Country were not sufficient, they
added some of the Publicks Lands, or bought with the publick Money. Thus
the People of <hi>Rome</hi> formerly gave Lands without doing injury to any person.
But <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> hawing seised the Soveraign Power by violence and Arms,
and standing in need of Guards and Armies against their Country, have not sent
you every one to his own dwelling, nor bought you Lands, nor divided among
you those they have conquered, nor given the ancient possessors some Money to
comfort them, though they had such store which they either took out of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury,
or received for Confiscations. But they send you into <hi>Italy</hi> it self,
where they had received no offence, ravishing away from the ancient Possessors (like
Thieves, and not like Conquerours) their Lands, their Houses, their Sepulchres,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65196:194"/>
their Temples, of which we deprive not vanquished Strangers, contenting our
selves with the Tenth of their Fruits. But they have divided among you the
Lands of your own Nation, who have born Arms with you under <hi>Caesar</hi> himself
against the Gauls, and offered Vows for the happy Success of the Expedition; and
against these they have led you, marching in Battel, with Ensigns displayed, as to a
War: And indeed you cannot live in Peace, nor abide in Safety with those who
have been forced to give up their Lands; for he that is driven out and despoiled
of his Estate studies your Destruction, and only waits an opportunity. So the
Principal Designs of the Tyrants was not that you should have Lands, for that
they might have done by other ways; but that having always Enemies ready to fall
upon you, you might be firm Props to their Power, to which your Fortunes were
fast bound, since Tyrants have no Guards more faithful than the Companions of
of their Crimes and their Fears; and to these, Good Gods! they have given the
name of Colonies; that is indeed, the Oppression of our Compatriots, and the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
of an insinite of innocent Persons, whom with design they have made your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
for their private Advantage. For our parts, to whom those that at present
govern the Commonwealth say, they will give us our Lives out of pure Grace, our
intention is, and always shall be, that you be confirmed in the Possession of your
Lands. We take God to witness, that as you do enjoy them you shall enjoy them,
and that no Person shall take them from you; neither <hi>Brutus</hi> nor <hi>Cassius,</hi> nor all
them have hazarded their Lives for your Liberty. There is yet in this business
one Difficulty, to which we will apply a Remedy which shall secure your Peace with
your Compatriots, and which you shall understand with joy. We will give Order
as soon as may be that the Ancient Possessors shall be payed the Purchase of their
Lands out of the Publick Moneys, that you for the future may possess them, not
only without Contradiction, but likewise with Security of your Persons.</p>

approved what <hi>Brutus</hi> said as perfectly just; and admired these Men,
so undaunted and so zealous for their Country. Thus having gained the
Affection of the People, the Affair was adjourned till the Morrow. As soon
as ever it was Day the Consul published the Assembly, where the Decre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of
the Senate was read; whereupon <hi>Cicero</hi> made an Excellent Discourse in
praise of the Amnesty, which the People hearkened to with pleasure, and
forthwith demanded that those retired to the Capitol might come down;
but they refused to come till they gave them Hostages: so they sent <hi>Anthony</hi>'s
and <hi>Lepidus</hi> Children. Their Arrival raised a General Acclamation and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause:
and when the Consuls would have spoke something, the People
would not hear them before they were reconciled, and had embraced each
other: which was done, but begot int he Consuls great fears and jealousies
that those Men would for the future have more Power in the City than they.
After this, <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Will being brought, the People would have it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
read: Where they found that he had adopted for his Son <hi>Octavius,</hi>
born of his Sisters Daughter; given this Gardens to the People, and left to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Roman Citizen seventy five Attick Drams. Hereupon the People en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into Fury, understanding that he whom they had but now treated as a
Tyrant, had an Affection for his Country: But above all, they looked upon
it as a thing worthy of Compassion to consider that <hi>Decimus Brutus,</hi> one of
his Murderers, was nominated his Heir by Substitution; for it is the custom
of the Romans to nominate a second Heir in case the first cannot be. It struck
all the World with horror, that <hi>Decimus,</hi> the substituted Heir of <hi>Caesar,</hi> had
attempted his life. But after that <hi>Piso</hi> had caused the Body to be brought to
the Place, there ran to guard it a great number of Persons in Arms; who
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65196:195"/>
with an Extraordinary Magnificence, and General Acclamation, placed it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Tribunal. Then the Lamentations and Tears were universal. The
Soldiers made a great noise with their Arms, and by little and little the whole
World began to repent them of the Amnesty. <hi>Anthony</hi> perceiving that,
lost not the Opportunity: And because he was obliged by the Duty of his
Office to make his Funeral Oration as he was a Consul, being Consul him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and is Friend and Kins-man, (for there was an Alliance between them)
with his usual Artifices he spoke in this manner.</p>

                           <p>IT is not just, Gentlemen, that I alone should undertake the Funeral-Praises
of this Great Man; it were fitter his Country did declare them: Therefore
I will only with the Voice of the Republick, and not my own, make Recital of

               <p>Having said these words, he began with a sad and sorrowful Countenance
the Recital of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Glorious Titles; pronouncing every thing distinctly,
and stopping more particularly at those whereby they had made him more
than Man, by the Qualities of Sacred and Inviolable, Father of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
Benefactor, Prince, and many others which till that time had never been
given to any Person. At every word turning himself towards the Body, and
animating his Speech by his Gesture; and when he pronounced any one of
those Titles, adding some intermingled Terms of Grief and Indignation:
as when he recited the Decree of the Senate, calling him Father of his
Country. <hi>See there,</hi> said he, <hi>the Testimony of your Acknowledgments.</hi> And
in pronouncing these words, Holy, Sacred, Inviolable, and the Refuge of
the Miserable, he added; <hi>Never any that fled to him for Refuge, perished; but
he himself is murdered, though made Holy and Sacred by our Decrees, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
exacted those Qualities from us, or even desired them; and surely we are in
a shameful Slavery if we give those Titles to unworthy Persons that never ask
them from us. But, Oh, faithful Citizens! you purge your selves well from this
Reproach by the Honours you now pay his Memory.</hi> After this, reciting the Act
of the Oath, by which they were all obliged to guard the Person of <hi>Caesar,</hi>
and to employ all their Forces so, that if any attempted his Person, whoever
exposed not his Life for his Defence should be execrable, he raised his Voice;
and extending his Hands towards the Capitol: <hi>Oh</hi> Jupiter! <hi>Protector of my
Country!</hi> said he, <hi>behold me here ready to revenge, as I have sworn: and since
it is a thing resolved by the Iudgment of all good Men, I beseech thee, with all
other Gods to be favourable to me.</hi> A Tumult hereupon arising among the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators,
who believed these words to be manifestly addressed to them. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
to appease them changed his Discourse, and said: <hi>But Gentlemen, this
Accident must rather be attributed to some God, than to Men; and we ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to provide against the present Necessities than speak of things past, since we
are threatned with extreme Misery for the future, and are upon the Point of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
again into our Antient Seditions, and the seeing all the Nobility of the City
perish. Let us them conduct this Sacred Person among the Gods, solemnly in
mournful Elegies singing his Praises.</hi> After having said these words, he
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65196:195"/>
tucked up his Robe as if he had been possessed with some Spirit; and gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it about him that he might have his Hands more at liberty, he went and
placed himself near the Bed where the Corps, lay, upon an Eminent Place;
and opening the Curtain, and looking in, he began to sing his Praises, as of
a Celestial Divinity: And the better to make him be believed to be of that
Race, he lifted his hands to Heaven; reciting even to the loss of breath, his
Wars, his Combats, his Victories, the Nations he had subdued, the Spoils
he had brought away; speaking of every thing as a Miracle; and crying out
many times, <hi>Thou alone art he who hast returned Victorious from so many Fights;
Thou alone art he who hast revenged the Country of the Injuries done her for three
hundred Years together; and constrained People till then indomitable, who alone
took and burnt the City, to ask Pardon on their Knees.</hi> Having said these
things and many more as of a Divine Person, he lored his Voice; and in a
mournful Tone, with Tears in his Eyes, lamented the unworthy Death of
his Friend, begging he might redeem his Life with his own; and at length
abandoning himself to Grief, he was so far transported as to discover the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and to shew at the top of a Pike his Robe, pierced with the
stabs he had received, and all stained with his Blood. And now the People
joyned their Lamentations with his, and Compassion was soon converted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Choler; for when the Consul ceasing to speak, they began the mournful
Airs, after the manner of the Countrey singing his great Actions, and after
that his deplorable death, and as if <hi>Caesar</hi> himself had called by name those
on whom he had heaped his Favours after having been his Enemies, they
heard these words which seemed addressed to the Conspirators; <hi>Must I then
Life unto my Murderers give.</hi> The People hereupon entred into fury, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that all the Conspirators, except <hi>Decimus Brutus,</hi> had been of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s
Party; and that <hi>Caesar,</hi> instead of revenging himself upon them, had
given them Dignities, Governments of Provinces, and Armies to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
and that after that they had conspired against him, and with them
<hi>Decimus Brutus,</hi> whom he had loved so well to make him his Heir. The
multitude being in this sort moved, and already prepared for Violence, some
one raised up from the Bed the Image of <hi>Caesar</hi> made in Wax, for the Body
could not be seen being layed within the Bed; but the Image turning upon a
Machine, was visible to all the World, and every Man might observe three
and twenty Wounds, as well on the Body as the Face. At this sad Spectacle
the People giving themselves over to tears, encompassed the place where <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
had been slain, and set it on fire; seeking every where for the Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
who were retired. Anger and Grief so far transporting the Multitude,
that some meeting <hi>Cinna</hi> Tribune of the People, whom for name sake they
took for <hi>Cinna</hi> the Pretor, who had declaimed against <hi>Caesar,</hi> he in vain told
them that they were mistaken, for they tore him in so many pieces, that the
least part of him could not be found to give Sepulture to. After this they
carried Fire to burn the Houses of the Conspirators, but the Resistance of
the Domesticks and the Prayers of the Neighbours prevented them; yet
not without threats that they would return again in Arms. On the Morrow
the Conspirators privately departed the City, and the People returned to
the bed where <hi>Caesar</hi> lay, carrying it to the Capitol to bury it in the Temple
before the Gods, as already consecrated; but the Priests opposing it, they
brought it back to the place, and upon the same Ground where formerly
stood the Palace of the Kings, gathering together all the Wood they could,
and with the Seats of the place and of all the neighbouring places, raising a
magnificent Pile, they thereon placed the Body; and some one having cast
upon it Crowns and other Military Presents, they set fire to it, and about it
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65196:196"/>
the People spent all the Night: They forthwith erected an Altar, and at
present there is a Temple where <hi>Caesar</hi> is adored as a God; for after that <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctavius,</hi>
his Adopted Son, who changed his Name into that of <hi>Caesar,</hi> had
(following his steps) taken upon him the Government of the State, he migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
strengthened and augmented that Monarchy of which he had laid the
Foundations, which endures to this day; and to pay him all possible Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
ranked him in the number of the Gods. From this Example it is,
that to this day the People give the Title of Gods to their Emperors after
their death (if they have neither been Trants, nor manifestly guilty of great
Crimes) they who formerly would not suffer them to take the name of King
whilst living.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XLIII"/> Thus fell <hi>Caesar</hi> on the Day which the Romans call the<note n="*" place="margin">The Fifteenth.</note> Ides of <hi>March:</hi>
an Augur had told him, that day would be fatal to him, but he laughed at it,
and the very same morning told him jesting, <hi>The Ides of</hi> March <hi>are come:</hi> to
which the other without surprize made answer, <hi>But not yet gone.</hi> Yet the
great Assurance of the Augur, nor many other Presages could not hinder
him from going to the Assembly; where he was murdered in the fifty sixth
Year of his Age: Happy in all things, Magnificent; and with just reason
comparable to <hi>Alexander;</hi> for they were both beyond measure Ambitious,
Warlike, ready in the Execution of what they had resolved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hardy in
Dangers: they spared not their Bodies and in War relyed not so much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Conduct, as upon their Bravery and good Fortune. The one went
a long journey in a Countrey without Water to go to <hi>Hammon,</hi> happily cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
over the bottom of the Pamphilian Gulf, the Sea being retired, as if his
Genius had locked up the Waters: As another time marching in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian,
it caused it to cease from raining. Navigated an unknown Sea: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the <hi>Indies,</hi> first scaled the Walls of a City, and leaped down alone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the midst of his Enemies, receiving thirteen Wounds; was always Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious;
and whatever War he was engaged in, he ended it in one or two
Battels. In <hi>Europe</hi> he subdued many Barbarous People, and reduced them
under his Obedience; together with the Grecians, a fierce People, and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of Liberty, who never before obeyed any Person but <hi>Philip;</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them for some time under the Honourable Title of General of the
Greeks. He carried his Arms almost through all <hi>Asia</hi> with an incredible
Celerity. And to comprize in a word the Happiness and Power of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
all the Countries he saw he conquered; and as he was designing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
the rest, he died. As for <hi>Caesar,</hi> passing the Ionian Sea in the midst of
Winter, he found it calm as well as the British Ocean, which he passed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any knowledge of it, in a time when his Pilots, driven by Storm against
the English Rocks, lost their Ships: Another time embarking alone by
Night in a little Boat, and rowing against the Waves, he commanded the
Pilot to hoist Sail, and rather to consider the Fortune of <hi>Caesar</hi> than the Sea.
He threw himself more than once all alone into the midst of his Enemies,
when his Men were all struck with Panick Fear: and is the only General
of the Romans that ever fought thirty times in Pitch'd Battel against the
Gauls, and subdued in <hi>Gaul</hi> forty Nations, before so dreadful to the Romans,
that in the Law dispensing with Priests and Old Men from going to the War,
the Wars against the Gauls are excepted, and the Priests and Old Men obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to bear Arms. Before <hi>Alexandria,</hi> seeing himself alone inclosed upon a
Bridge, he laid down his Purple, threw himself into the Sea; and pursued
by his Enemies, swam a long time under Water, only by Intervals lifting up
his head to take breath; till coming near his Ships, he held up his hands, was
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65196:196"/>
known, and so saved. For the Civil Wars, which he either undertook out
of Fear (as himself says) or out of Ambition, he had to deal with the greatest
Generals of the Age, fighting at the Head of many great Armies; not Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,
but Romans, encouraged by their former Actions, and by their
good Fortune: yet he defeated them all; and not one of them, but he ruined
in a Fight or two. But we cannot say of him as of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he was
never overcome; for he suffered once a great loss against the Gauls, under
the Conduct of <hi>Triturius</hi> and <hi>Cotta,</hi> his Lieutenants: In <hi>Spain</hi> his Army was
so near blocked up by <hi>Petreius</hi> and <hi>Afranius,</hi> that he wanted but little of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
besieged: At <hi>Dyrrhachium</hi> and in <hi>Africa</hi> they turned their Backs; and
in <hi>Spain,</hi> against the young <hi>Pompey,</hi> the fled. But for <hi>Caesar</hi> himself, he
was always undaunted; and whatever War he engaged in, came off in the
end Victorious: and the Roman Empire which now extends it self by Sea
and Land, from the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> to the Atlantick Ocean, was brought under
his Power; partly by his Valour, and partly by his Clemency. He setled
himself much better than <hi>Sylla,</hi> and governed himself with more moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for being King in effect in spite of all the World, he took not that name.
At last, making his Preparations for other Wars, he was surprized by death
as well as <hi>Alexander.</hi> Their Armies were also alike; for the Soldiers of both
were chearful in Fight and hardy, but stubborn and mutinous when over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought with Labour. The Deaths of both of them were equally mourned
and lamented by their Armies, who attributed to them Divine Honours.
They were both well made in Body, and of Noble Aspects: both descended
from <hi>Iupiter;</hi> one by <hi>Eacus</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> and the other by <hi>Anchises</hi> and
<hi>Venus.</hi> Though they were inflexible when resisted, they were easle to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and be reconciled, and likewise to do good to such as they had vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
contenting themselves with the Victory. Hitherto the Comparison is
just, save only that their Beginnings were not equal; for <hi>Alexander</hi> began
with the Quality of a King, in which he had been before instructed by his
Father <hi>Philip:</hi> but <hi>Caesar</hi> was only a Private Man; and though he were of
an Illustrious Race, yet his Fortunes were much incumbred. They both
despised the Presages that threatned them, without injuring those Divines
foretold their death: and almost the same Signs happened to them, and a
like Event; for in the Sacrifices made by one and the other twice, they
found not the Chief of the Entrails of the Victims; the first time they were
only threatned with great Danger: <hi>Alexander</hi>'s happened when besieging
the Oxidrakes, being mounted first upon the Wall, and the too great weight
breaking the Ladders behind him, he beheld himself deserted by his Men,
and threw himself into the midst of his Enemies; where having received ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Wounds on his Breast, and a great blow on the Neck, he was ready to
die; when the Macedonians touched with shame, broke open the Gates,
and relieved him. The like happened to <hi>Caesar</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in the Fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and young <hi>Pompey;</hi> where, seeing his Men went on trembling,
he advanced betwixt the two Armies, received two hundred Darts on his
Buckler; till such time as Fear having given place to Shame, all the Army
ran in, and secured him from the Danger. Thus the first Entrails without the
Chief threatned only Danger of Death, but the Second were a certain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of Death it self. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the Divine after having sacrificed, said to
<hi>Appollodorus,</hi> who feared <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Ephestion,</hi> that he need fear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
for they both should shortly die. <hi>Ephestion</hi> dying some time after,
<hi>Appollodorus</hi> doubting lest there might be some Conspiracy formed against
the King, gave him notice of the Prediction:: He only laughed at it; and
informing himself of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> what those Presages meant, he told him it
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65196:197"/>
was a Sign of Death; whereupon he again laughed, praising <hi>Appollodorus</hi>'s
love, and the Divine's freedom. As for <hi>Caesar,</hi> the last time he went to the
Senate, as we have said a little before, the same Presage presenting, he said
smiling, he had seen the like in <hi>Spain:</hi> to which the Augur answering, that
he was then in danger, but now the Sign was mortal, he yielded in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to that Advice, and offered another Sacrifice; but tired with the length
of the Ceremonies, entred the Palace, and perished. There happened to
<hi>Alexander</hi> the same thing; for when he returned from the <hi>Indies</hi> to <hi>Babylon</hi>
with his Army, being come nigh the City, the Chaldeans counselled him to
defer his Entry; to whom having given this Verse for Answer,
<q>Who promises most Good's the best Divine,</q>
they besought him at least, that he would not let his Army enter with their
Faces to the West; but would fetch a Compass, that in entring they might
see the Rising Sun and the City. It is said, he would have obeyed them in
this; but in marching about he met with a Marshy Ground, which made
him slight the second as well as the first Advice, so that he entred the City
with his Face to the West. Some time after embarking upon the <hi>Euphrates,</hi>
and going down to the River <hi>Pallacota,</hi> which receives the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and

<hi>Assyria,</hi> he resolved to make a Dam; and it is said, that going down the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he laughed at the Chaldeans, because he had gone into <hi>Babylon</hi> and come
out of it again in a Boat without any harm: But Death attended him at his
Return from this Voyage. <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Raillery with the Augur, who told him
the Ides of <hi>March</hi> were fatal to him, was much alike; he answered him
jearing, the Ides were come, and yet he was killed the same day. So that
herein there was great agreement between them, both in the Presages they
received from the Divines without being offended, their Raillery, and the
Event of the Prediction. They were likewise great Lovers of the Sciences,
as well of their own Country as Strangers. <hi>Alexander</hi> conferred with the
<hi>Brachmen,</hi> who are esteemed the most subtil and sagacious of the Indians,
as the <hi>Magi</hi> are of the Persians. <hi>Caesar</hi> did the like with the Egyptians when
he re-established <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in her Kingdom, which occasioned him when the
Peace was made to reform many things amongst the Romans; and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Example of the Egyptians, he regulated the Year by the Course of
the Sun, which before was governed by the Moon; and so till then were
unequal, by reason of the Intercalary Days. It happened to him likewise,
that not one of those who conspired his Death escaped, but were all punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as they deserved by his Son, and as the Murderers of <hi>Philip</hi> were by <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander;</hi> but in what manner, we shall relate in the following Books.</p>

the Romans being in this manner slain by his Enemies,
the People celebrated his Funerals. But because all those who
any way contributed to his dearh were punished, we shall in
this and the Book next following treat of the manner how the
principal Heads of this Conspiracy perished, and after that conclude the
History of these Civil Wars. <hi>Anthony</hi> having lost the good will of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
by ministring occasion to the people to violate the indemnity at <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
Funeral Pomp, and being the cause of their running to set on fire the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the Conspirators, regained their good esteem by an action which had
respect to the publick Good. There was one <hi>Amasius</hi> who falsly giving
himself out to be the Son of <hi>Marius,</hi> had taken his name, and only in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of his reporting him to be his Father, was beloved of the People;
for by that supposition they thought him a Kinsman of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s; and indeed
he appeared extremely afflicted for his death, erected an Altar in the place
where he was burnt, and attended by a Troop of Hectors terrified the
Conspirators, of whom the greatest part having left the City, those to
whom <hi>Caesar</hi> had given Governments retired likewise. <hi>Decimus Brutus</hi> to
that <hi>Gaul</hi> neighbouring upon <hi>Italy; Trebonius</hi> into <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Tullius Cimber</hi>
into <hi>Bithynia.</hi> As for <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> to whom the Senate bore great
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65196:198"/>
affection, they had been designed by <hi>Caesar</hi> to command the year following,
<hi>Cassius</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and at present were Praetors in the
City. In the present juncture of Affairs they laboured to gain the Soldiers
designed for the Colonies, by permitting them among other things to sell
their shares, which the Law prohibited them till after twenty years posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
It was reported that <hi>Amatius</hi> had a design against their lives, and
waited only for an opportunity to execute it, which being told to <hi>Anthony,</hi>
he according to the authority he had by virtue of his charge caused him to
be arrested, and with an extraordinary boldness put him to death without
any tryal. The Senate were amazed at it, as a violent action, not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by their Laws: however, they suffered it, because they saw no other
way of security for <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Brutus;</hi> but the companions of <hi>Amatius</hi> and
the rest of the people affected with grief for him, and enraged against <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi>
that he durst in that manner treat a person whom they loved, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they ought not to dissemble it, but gathering together in the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to cry out, and rail against <hi>Anthony,</hi> requiring the Magistrates to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
<hi>Amatius</hi> his Altar, and perform the first Sacrifices to <hi>Caesar.</hi> And
when <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Soldiers would have driven them thence, they grew more
tumultuous, making greater noise than before; some of them shewing the
Basis from whence they had taken <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Statues, and one of them cryed
out he could likewise shew them the Shop where they were melting down,
they presently followed him, and finding it as he said, set fire to the House.
Another Party of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s people coming to quench it, some of those
Mutineers were slain, and some taken, of whom the Slaves were hanged,
and the rest thrown headlong down the Rocks. The Tumult being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased,
that affection people bore to <hi>Anthony</hi> converted into hatred. On
the contrary the Senate were well satisfied; for without this, the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
had not been in security of their persons. But when <hi>Anthony</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the Fathers the return of <hi>Sextus Pompey</hi> (Son of that great <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
lamented by all men, against whom <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Party yet made War in
<hi>Spain</hi>) and to give him out of the Treasury fifty Millions of Attick Drams,
in recompence of the Goods of his Father which had been confiscate, and
to make him Admiral as his Father had been, with power to dispose of all
the Roman Fleet as he should think fit; all the Senators were astonished,
approved his proposition, and spent the rest of that day in praises of him; for
no man had ever appeared so affectionate to the publick Good as the great
<hi>Pompey,</hi> nor had been so universally lamented, and `twas because <hi>Brutus</hi>
and <hi>Cassius</hi> had followed him, that all men still honoured them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Cicero</hi> without ceasing praised <hi>Anthony,</hi> and the Senate who were not
ignorant that he was hated by the people, permitted him to chuse as a Guard
of his person as many as he pleased of the old Soldiers then in the City. He,
whether he had before provided for it, or that he gladly made use of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
occasion, took such Guards as amounted to six thousand persons;
nor did he enlist private Soldiers; for he thought at a pinch he could easily
find them elsewhere, but all experienced Officers, whose affection he had
gained in the time they had served under <hi>Caesar,</hi> and the most considerable
of these he had made choice of for Tribunes, to whom he shewed Honour
and Respect, making them partakers in all things fit to be communicated.
The Senate began to grow jealous of his Guards, whether because of their
great numbers, or because they were all chosen Men, and advised him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to a certain number to avoid envy, which he promised to do as
soon as the Tumults of the people were appeased. Moreover the Senate
and people having approved all that <hi>Caesar</hi> had done and decreed of this,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65196:199"/>
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> had the Register, which when <hi>Caesar</hi> had thoughts of departing on
his designed Expedition he had left with him, with great numbers of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
on which he had yet made no Order; so that <hi>Faberius, Caesar</hi>'s Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary,
being perfectly at his Devotion, he added many things in favour
of several persons, gave Gratuities to Cities, Potentates, and to his own
Guards, as if done by <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Order, whereas they owed the obligation
only to <hi>Anthony:</hi> he likewise by the same means placed many persons in
the degree of Senators, and performed great quantity of other matters at
the Senates request, that he might lessen the aversion they had to his
Guards: such was <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Conduct.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> As for <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> (seeing the people and the old Soldiers continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their animosities against them, and imagining some other might be
found to make an attempt upon their lives, as well as <hi>Amatius,</hi> and being
besides sensible of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s malice, who now having nothing to stand in
fear of, being so well guarded, hindred the re-establishment of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth)
they began to provide for their own safety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> besides the firm
relyance they had in <hi>Decimus Brutus</hi> who was at hand with three Legions,
they wrote to <hi>Trebonius</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> and to <hi>Tullius</hi> in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> to raise Money
with as much secresie as they could, and gave order to secure the Soldiery
to them, whilst they put themselves in a readiness to take possession of those
Governments <hi>Caesar</hi> had commissionated them for. But because their due
time for departure was not yet come, they judging it indecent to go take
possession of their Provinces before the time of executing their Charges in
the City was expired, and yet had rather spend the rest of the year as
private persons, than exercising the Office of Praetors, whilst neither their
persons were secure, nor they honoured according to their deserts. The
Senate, knowing their thoughts, gave them Commission to cause Corn to
be brought from all parts into the City, till the time limited for their going
into their Provinces, which they did, that <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> might not seem
to flie, so great care had they of the reputation of those two Men, for
whose sake especially they favoured the Party of the Conspirators. After
that the Praetors were gone out of the City to execute their Commission,
<hi>Anthony</hi> being thenceforth the only powerful Man, could heartily have
wished the Command of a Province with an Army, and especially cast his
eyes upon <hi>Syria;</hi> but understanding he should increase the jealousie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of him, if he demanded it for himself, and that on the other side
the Senate had gained <hi>Dolobella</hi> his Colleague, with whom he had no fair
understanding, to oppose all his designs, he perswaded <hi>Dolobella,</hi> who was
young and ambitious, to demand <hi>Syria,</hi> to the prejudice of <hi>Cassius,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Army destined to War upon the Parthians, and not address
himself for the obtaining it to the Senate (for that would prove to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
but to the people by way of Decree. He gladly embracing the
motion, presently makes his proposition to the people: whereupon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
complaining, that he attempted against what <hi>Caesar</hi> had decreed; he
answered, That <hi>Caesar</hi> had not decreed to any person the Commission of
the War against the Parthians; that <hi>Cassius</hi> to whom he had given <hi>Syria</hi>
had first thwarted his Decree, by permitting the Soldiers to whom he had
given Lands to dwell on, to sell them without staying the twenty years as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
by the Law, that however it would be dishonourable for him if <hi>Dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi>
should not be preferred before <hi>Cassius</hi> in the Government of <hi>Syria.</hi>
Hereupon the Senate suborned <hi>Asprenas</hi> Tribune of the People to break up
the Assembly, under pretence of some evil Augury, hoping that <hi>Anthony,</hi>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:65196:199"/>
who was Consul and Augur, and whom they believed yet an Enemy to
<hi>Dolobella,</hi> would joyn with the Tribune: but as soon as he declared that
there were unhappy presages (which belonged to anothers Office to do)
<hi>Anthony</hi> said that he was a knave, and exhorted the Tribes to give their
Votes on <hi>Dolobella</hi>'s proposition. Thus he obtained the Government of
<hi>Syria,</hi> with Commission to make War upon the Parthians with the Legions
designed by <hi>Caesar</hi> to that purpose, and those already marched into <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi>
and thus at last they came to know that <hi>Anthony</hi> and his Colleague
understood each other. <hi>Dolobella</hi> having obtained these things from the
people, <hi>Anthony</hi> demanded <hi>Macedon</hi> from the Senate, knowing well that
after the grant of <hi>Syria</hi> to the other, <hi>Macedon,</hi> where there was no Army,
would not be refused him. So he obtained it to the discontent of most,
and general wonder of all the Fathers, that he had suffered the Army which
was in that Province to be given to <hi>Dolobella,</hi> who however they were much
better satisfied should have the dispose of it than <hi>Anthony.</hi> Hereupon they
took occasion to demand of <hi>Anthony</hi> other Provinces for <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi>
which he assented to, and gave them <hi>Cyrene</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi> or as some say both
those were given to <hi>Cassius,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia</hi> to <hi>Brutus.</hi> Thus went Affairs
within the City.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Octavius</hi> Nephew of <hi>Caesar,</hi> as descended from his Sister, had been <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
by his Uncle created General of the Horse for one year, after he had made
that Dignity annual, to the intent that many of his Friends might enjoy it
one after the other. But because he was yet too young, he had sent him to
<hi>Apollonia</hi> a City situate on the Coasts of the Ionian Sea, to study and learn
the Art of War, till such time as he should take him along with him against
the Parthians. In the mean time several Cornets of Horse that were in
<hi>Macedon</hi> came by turns to attend him, that he might be the better instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by exercising them, and there came likewise very often Tribunes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Officers to pay their respects to him in quality of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Kinsman, and
he receiving all Men with great kindness, respect and civility, gained to
himself the hearts of the whole Army. He had been now six Months at
<hi>Apollonia,</hi> when one Evening news was brought him that <hi>Coesar</hi> had been
slain in full Senate by his most intimate Friends, who had at that time great
power in the City, and because there was none that could give him any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
account, fear seized upon him, not knowing whether the Senate had
contributed to the action, or whether it were a conspiracy of particular
Men, whether those guilty of it were punished, or whether they were yet
living, or lastly, whether the people had declared for them or no. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
his Roman Friends gave him advice to retire to the Army in <hi>Macedon</hi>
for his security, where, if he understood it an attempt of particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
he might take heart and revenge <hi>Caesar,</hi> and some Officers there were,
offered to be his Guides, and serve him as Guards in the way. But his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and <hi>Philip</hi> his Father-in-law wrote to him not to be too presumptuous,
that he should undertake nothing rashly, but remember that <hi>Caesar</hi> after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
overcome all his Enemies was slain by those Friends he had most confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in, that a private condition, at least for some time would best secure
him, but that however he should return to <hi>Rome</hi> accompanyed with some of
his faithful Friends. To them he gave credence, and without knowing
what had happened since <hi>Caesar</hi>'s death, bid adieu to the Officers of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and passed the Sea. He would not land at <hi>Brundusium</hi> (because not
being sure of that Garrison, he was wary of falling into his Enemies
hands) but at another little City not far distant from <hi>Brundusium</hi> called
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65196:200"/>
                  <hi>Lupia,</hi> where he sojourned some time. There receiving Letters which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the particulars of the Assassinate, of the sorrow wherewith the
people had resented it, of his Will, and the Decree of the Senate, his
Friends were of opinion, that he would be obliged so much the more to
stand in fear of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Enemies being his Son and Heir, and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
him to refuse the Inheritance and Adoption, but he judging it
would be an infamy for him not to revenge <hi>Caesar,</hi> marched towards <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusium,</hi>
having sent some of his people before to discover if any of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassines
were there in Ambuscade. But when the Garrison of the City
coming forth to meet him, had received him as <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Son, he took heart,
sacrificed to the Gods, and forthwith caused himself to be called <hi>Caesar.</hi>
`Tis the Roman custom to take with the name of their Family the name of
their adoptive Father, but he quite changed his, and instead of <hi>Octavius</hi>
the Son of <hi>Octavius,</hi> would be called <hi>Caesar</hi> the Son of <hi>Caesar.</hi> As soon as
he had taken this name, the people flocked in from all parts to complement
him, not only his Father's Friends, Freed Men and Slaves, but likewise
the Soldiers who convoyed Provisions and Money to the Army in <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
or which brought to <hi>Brundusium</hi> Tribute and other Monies levyed in
the Provinces. Being therefore encouraged by the concourse of so vast a
Multitude, by the glorious name of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and by the affection all Men
professed to bear him, he took his way towards the City with a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Train, which dayly like a Torrent grew greater. So that now he no
more feared open force, but took so much the more care to secure himself
from secret ambushes, because he knew not the greatest part of those that
accompanied him. As for the Cities, there were some had no great affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for him, but the Veterans or old Soldiers to whom <hi>Caesar</hi> had lately given
Lands ran from the Colonies to offer themselves to this young Captain.
They deplored the death of their Benefactor, declared against <hi>Anthony</hi> who
had let so horrid a crime go unpunished, and protested they would be the
revengers of it, if he would please to head them. He praised them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
them to preserve this good will of theirs to another Season, and so
sent them home. Being come near to <hi>Terracina</hi> about<note n="*" place="margin">Fifty Miles.</note> four hundred Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
from <hi>Rome,</hi> news was brought him, that the Consuls had taken
from <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> the Governments of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Macedon,</hi> instead of
which, and to comfort them they had given them two lesser, to wit, <hi>Cyrene</hi> and
the Island of <hi>Crete;</hi> that some Exiles were returned to the City; that they
had sent for <hi>Pompey,</hi> made some Senators according to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Memoirs,
with many other matters. When he was arrived at <hi>Rome</hi> he found his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Father-in-law and all those who had any care of his Affairs in great
fear and trouble, because of the Senates aversion for <hi>Caesar,</hi> the Decree past
for discharging the Murderers from crim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and the pride of <hi>Anthony</hi> now
grown powerful in the City, who had neither gone himself nor sent out
any to meet the Son of <hi>Caesar.</hi> He quieted their trouble by telling them he
would go himself to <hi>Anthony</hi> as the younger to the elder, and as a private
person to a Consul, that he would pay his respects to the Senate as he was
obliged in duty, that as for the Decree it passed in a time when no Man
opposed it, but now that one was found to prosecute, the people would
reach forth a strong hand, the Senate would give life to the authority of the
Laws, the immortal Gods would sustain the justice of his cause, and perhaps
<hi>Anthony</hi> himself would be concerned for it. As for his part he could not
refuse the Inheritance and Adoption, without doing injury to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and injustice to the Roman People, in not paying what had been left
them by his Will, that he had much rather not only hazard himself, but
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65196:200"/>
suffer death it self, than after having been made choice of by <hi>Caesar</hi> before
all other persons in the World, shew himself unworthy of that Great Man's
Choice. Then turning to his Mother, he pronounced those words of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi>
to <hi>Thetis.</hi>

               <p>He added, that this Discourse had given Immortality to <hi>Achilles,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
being pursued to Effects; and that for his part <hi>Caesar</hi> had not only been
his Friend but his Father, his Comrade but his Captain; who had not been
slain in fair War, but wretchedly massacred in full Senate. Hereupon his
Mother changing her fear into joy, embraced him as alone worthy to be Son
to <hi>Caesar;</hi> and with many powerful expressions exhorted him to execute his
Resolutions. However, she advised him rather to employ Policy and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
than open Violence. <hi>Caesar</hi> having praised her Counsel, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to follow it, towards the Evening dismissed his Friends, giving them or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to meet him next Morning early upon the place with as much Company
as they could bring. There he comes up to <hi>Caius, Anthony</hi>'s Brother, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of the City, and declared to him that he accepted the Adoption; for it
was the Custom among the Romans to have Adoptions authorized by the
Pretors. After having caused his Declaration to be registred, he went off
from the place, to go seek out <hi>Anthony,</hi> who was then at <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Gardens,
which <hi>Caesar</hi> had given to him. They let him wait a good while at the
Gate, which made him suspect that <hi>Anthony</hi> had no kindness for him; but
at last being entred, there passed nothing but civil and obliging words from
one to the other: And when <hi>Caesar</hi> was to discourse of the Business about
which he came, he spoke in this manner.</p>

                           <p>MY Father (for the Affection <hi>Caesar</hi> had for you, and your Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments,
oblige me to call you so.) I applaud what you have
done for him, and shall ever own the Obligation: But pray give my Grief
the liberty to tell you, that there are some things I cannot approve. Whilst
<hi>Caesar</hi> was murdered you was not there, for his Murderers had stopped
you at the Gate; otherwise you had either saved his life, or perished with
him: but if your loss were inevitable, I am glad that you were not there.
After this, when some endeavoured to decree Rewards to the Murderers,
as if they had slain a Tyrant, you generously opposed it; for which, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
I am infinitely obliged to you. Though certain it is they had also
resolved to make a Riddance of you; not as the future Revenger of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
death (which we believe) but (as they say) for fear there should remain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him a Successor in the Tyranny. Though after the Action these People
who said they had slain a Tyrant, being sensible they were guilty of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
fled to the Capitol; either as Criminals to seek for Refuge in a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Place, or as Enemies to seize upon the Fortress. How then could
they obtain an Amnesty, and a Decree forbidding any Prosecution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
for this Action, unless by corrupting with Money some of the Senate
and People? But being Consul, you ought to have taken care on which
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65196:201"/>
Part was the Plurality of Voices; and presiding in the Senate, had you vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
against them, you had carried it, and reduced to your Opinion those
who had been deceived. On the Contrary, you delivered to the Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
some of your own House in Hostage, and sent them to them into the
Capitol; but I will think you were constrained to it by those that were
suborned. Then when after that Noble Funeral-Oration you made, the
Will being read, the People who yet had <hi>Caesar</hi> fresh in memory, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fire to burn his Murderers Houses, though then forbearing it in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of their Neighbours; when on the Morrow they twice returned to
Arms, why did not you assist them? Why did not you head them with
Sword and Torch in your Hand? Why did you not do Justice your self?
Did you expect other Judgment against Publick Criminals? You the
Friend of <hi>Caesar,</hi> you Consul, you <hi>Anthony,</hi> you who could make use of the
Power of your Office to put to death<note n="*" place="margin">Amatius.</note> 
                              <hi>Marius,</hi> have let Murderers escape:
Nay, have suffered some of them to retire into the Provinces, whose Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
they must needs unjustly hold, having massacred him from
whom they held them. It is true, that being Consuls, you and <hi>Dolobella,</hi>
you have done well to take from them <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Macedon;</hi> and certainly
I had been much obliged to you for it, had you not at the same time gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them <hi>Cyrene</hi> and <hi>Crete;</hi> giving Governments to Fugitives, to fortifie
themselves against me. Is it not likewise by your consent that <hi>Decimus,</hi>
one of the Murderers of my Father, as well as the rest, holds the hither
<hi>Gaul?</hi> You may tell me perhaps it is by Decree of the Senate; but you
have approved it, you sat as President; you, who more than any Man
else, ought to have opposed it, even for your proper Interest. Well might
you, in favour of them, assent to their Indempnity and Impunity; but to
give them Governments and Dignities is to do an injury to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and
make a scorn of your self. Grief makes me say things disproportionate to
my Age, and to the respect I bear you: But I speak to the most assured of
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s Friends; to him whom he advanced in Honours and Dignities,
and who possibly had at this present been his adopted Son, had he known
you could have resolved with your self to pass from the Race of <hi>Hercules,</hi>
to that of <hi>Aeneas;</hi> that was his only doubt when he thought of making
choice of a Successor. I beseech you therefore, <hi>Anthony,</hi> by those Gods
that preside over Friendship, by <hi>Caesar</hi>'s self, that you would yet change
something of what you have done, for you may do it if you will; or at
least, that you will aid me in revenging my Father's death, with the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the People, and of all those who yet persevere in the affection
they once bore him. If you have any fear of those people, or of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
I only desire you would not oppose my designs. As for any thing
else, you know the state of my Affairs. That I am obliged to pay the people
what my Father left them, and that speedily, left the benefit being delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
remain without acknowledgment; and that I become the occasion that
those who ought to be sent to the Colonies stay longer in the City. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I desire, that of all that was carried to your House, to be the better
secured after my Father's death, the richest and most pretious things may
be yours; I only demand that Silver Money he had raised for those Wars
he was preparing to make, that I may pay those Legacies he left to the
People; and I shall content my self at present if you furnish me with so
much as is necessary to pay three hundred thousand Men what is due to
them by the Head. I would entreat you if I durst, to lend me wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to pay the rest, or be my Security for taking it up at Interest out of the
Treasury, till such time as the Goods left by this Succession are sold, in
which I shall labour Might and Main.</p>

                           <p>MY Son, if <hi>Caesar</hi> with his Succession and his Name had likewise left
you the Empire, you have reason to demand of me an Account
of the Administration of Publick Affairs, and it is but just that I should
give it you; but the Roman People having never given the Sovereign
Power to any Person by Succession, not to the Kings themselves, whom
they have expelled, and bound themselves by Oath never more to suffer
them (a thing which the Conspirators reproach your Father with, saying,
they have slain a King, and not a Magistrate) there is therefore no necessity
I should give you an Account of what concerns the Publick, and I likewise
discharge you of all Obligations you are willing to be bound in to me, for
I have done nothing for your sake, and have only had in prospect the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Good in all my Actions, except only one, whereby I have rendred a
signal Service both to <hi>Caesar</hi> and to you: For if for my own security, and
to avoid Envy, I had permitted them to decree Rewards to the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators,
as having slain a Tyrant, <hi>Caesar</hi> had been declared a Tyrant, to
whom neither Respect nor Honour was due; for the Roman Laws require
that Tyrant's Bodies be cast into the Draught, their Memory abolished,
and their Goods confiscate. Out of a fear lest this might happen, I strove
hard for <hi>Caesar,</hi> to preserve his Glory immortal, and to cause his Funerals
to be publickly solemnized. I feared neither danger nor envy, though I
had to deal with violent people, accustomed to Murthers, and who (as you
know) had already conspired against me; and that the Senate were incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to mischief against your Father, because he had usurped the Sovereign
Authority over that Body. Yet I chose rather to run all these hazards, and
should rather have undergone all manner of misfortunes, than have suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that <hi>Caesar,</hi> the Greatest of Men, and the most happy in many things,
and whom I esteemed the most worthy of Glory of any Man of this Age,
should have been deprived of Honour and Sepulture. The Dangers to
which I have exposed my self have gained you all that <hi>Caesar</hi> possessed; his
Family, his Name, his Dignities, his Goods; and surely you ought rather
to thank me, than blame my Conduct, if I have yielded to some thing to
content the Senate, or given recompence to those to whom it was due, or
done whatsoever it were for any reason I thought necessary; old as I am,
and you yet but a young Man. But this shall suffice as to that matter. As
for what you would object that I aspire to the Dominion, I have no such
thoughts, though I do not think my self unworthy; nor is it any insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
thing to me to be left out of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Will, contenting my self to
be descended of a Race that derives its Original from <hi>Hercules.</hi> As for
the Money you talk of borrowing out of the Treasury to serve your own
Occasions, I believe that you do but jest; unless, as it is probable, you
have not heard that your Father left the Treasury empty; and that since
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65196:202"/>
he made himself Master of the Empire, all the publick Moneys that were
before carried thither, were after carried to his House, where among his
Goods they will be found when we shall decree a Search to be made for
them; which will be done without giving any offence to the dead <hi>Caesar:</hi>
Or were he living, he would not refuse to give an Account of his Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
as it is but just he should. Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a Right to those Goods, and will not quit them to you without Tryal.
Nor was there so much Silver brought to my House as you imagine, nor
have I any of it left; for it was all divided, as being a Tyrant's Mony, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Magistrates and chief Men of the City, except only <hi>Dolobella</hi>
and my Brethren. And if you should chance to find out any, you will not
if you be wise, give it to the people; but employ it to appease such as may
dammage you: and if they themselves be wise, they will send away the
people to the Colonies: For the People, as you may have lately learnt out
of Greek Books, are a thing of no stability, but ever floating to and fro
like Waves of the Sea, as it has often happened in our Republick; where
the People, after having raised up to the Skies those that courted their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
afterwards brought them on their Knees.</p>

                  <hi>Caesar</hi> angred at these words, for the most part injurious, retired, invoking
oft times his Father, and calling him by his name. Suddainly after he put
to Sale the Goods come to him by this Succession, and exhorted the People
to assist him in the good design he had for them against <hi>Anthony</hi> his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
who openly opposed him; and against the Senate, who had decreed
Inquisition to be made for Publick Moneys. Many persons began to fear
<hi>Caesar,</hi> as young as he was, because of his Father's Liberality to the Soldiers
and People, whose affections he was now absolutely gaining by the Distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he was about to make; so that most judged he would not long continue
in the Condition of a private Person: But they feared much more lest <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
coming to an Accommodation with this Young Man, full of Glory
and Riches, should seize on the Sovereign Power as well as <hi>Caesar.</hi> In the mean
time they were well satisfied to see them at this discord, because one served
now as an obstacle to another's designs; and by the Inquisition after Publick
Moneys, of which they believed a great part would be found in <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers,
his Heir would become poor, and the Treasury rich. Dayly likewise were
Processes formed about the Lands possessed by <hi>Caesar;</hi> some demanding them
as their particular Right, others pretending they belonged to the Publick, as
being confiscated from proscribed or banished Persons. <hi>Anthony</hi> or <hi>Dolobel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
his Colleague, were Judges, of most part of these; and if some happened
to be tryed before other Judges, <hi>Caesar</hi> was as hardly used out of favour to
<hi>Anthony,</hi> though he produced Authentick Contracts of the Purchase made
by his Father; and likewise pleaded the last Decree of the Senate, by which
all that <hi>Caesar</hi> had done was ratified. They affronted him likewise by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Insolencies out of the presence of the Judges; from which <hi>Pedius</hi> and
<hi>Pinarius,</hi> to whom <hi>Caesar</hi> had likewise by Will left part of the Inheritance,
were not exempt. Upon complaint made to <hi>Anthony</hi> of the Outrages they,
as well as <hi>Caesar,</hi> suffered; shewing him the Decree of the Senate; and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him, that if there were some Lands unjustly usurped by <hi>Caesar,</hi> they
were ready to pay the value of them; but that it was just all the rest <hi>Caesar</hi>
had done should be allowed. He answered, that possibly the Decree meant
not any thing at present in question, and that the very words in which it
was expressed ought be interpreted according to the Senate's intention,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65196:202"/>
who having the Indempnity only in view, would not touch upon what was
past; not that they approved it, nor in consideration of death; but because
it was then expedient to act so, and necessary to appease the people. That it
was not equal to have more consideration of the words of a Decree, than of
the mind of the Judges; and to deny Audience to so many Citizens whom
the Civil Wars had spoiled of their Goods, and those of their Predecessors;
in favour of a young Man, who now beholding himself richer than his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
could make him hope to be, employed not his Riches in Liberalities;
but in making of Creatures to bring to effect his ambitious designs. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless,
for what concerned them when they should receive from <hi>Caesar</hi>
what part of the Inheritance belonged to them, he would maintain them in
it. After this Answer of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s, <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Coheirs desired their shares of
the Inheritance, for fear of losing them by reason of the many Suits com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced;
not for their sakes, but <hi>Caesar</hi>'s: However, soon after they again
restored it into his hands. After this, the time of the Plays wherewith <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
as Pretor, ought to divert and delight the Citizens, drawing nigh, <hi>Caius,</hi>
Brother to <hi>Anthony,</hi> his Colleague, who administred that Charge in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
had taken care of them; and to that purpose made magnificent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations,
out of hopes that the People charmed by those Spectacles, should
vote <hi>Brutus</hi> and his Companions Return. <hi>Caesar</hi> on his part, the better to
gain the multitude, still as he received any Moneys by the Sale of the Goods
of the Inheritance, put it into the hands of the chief Men of the Tribes, to
distribute to such as first demanded it: And going to all places where these
Sales were made, gave order to the publick Cryers to appraise all at less than
it was worth, because of the uncertain success of the Law-Suits, and that
he might dispatch paying what he ought by his Father's Will. These cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
increased the People's affection to him, and they were moved to compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for the unjust Persecutions under which he suffered. But when they
saw that besides the Goods of this Succession, he likewise exposed to Sale his
own Patrimony, with all that he had elsewhere, and with that his Mother's
Lands, those of <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Pedius</hi> and <hi>Pinarius</hi> shares too; and all this to
furnish him for the payment of Legacies; as if he could not raise Money e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
by selling <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Goods, by reason of his Enemies Lets and Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Then the People, perswaded that this Liberality proceeded from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and not from the first <hi>Caesar,</hi> adored this young Man; applauding his
Patience and Generosity, and protesting they would not much longer suffer
<hi>Anthony</hi>'s Insolence: And in truth they evidenced it at those Spectacles that
<hi>Brutus</hi> exhibited at such vast Expence; for when some, bribed to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
cryed out that <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> should be recalled, and that the rest of
the Spectators seemed inclined to pity them, a great number of the People
running on in a Croud, made the Plays to cease till such time as those who
demanded their Return were silent. So that <hi>Caesar</hi> having made <hi>Brutus</hi> and
<hi>Cassius</hi> lose the hopes of their Return by means of their Plays, they resolved
to seize by force of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Macedon,</hi> to which they had been appointed
by the Senate, before <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Dolobella.</hi> That young Consul being
hereof advertized, speedily advances towards <hi>Syria</hi> by the way of <hi>Asia,</hi>
through which he passed to gather in the Money of that Province. But <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
judging he should have occasion of Forces, and not being ignorant that
the Army of <hi>Macedon</hi> was composed of excellent Troops; that they were
six Legions, store of Archers and Light-armed Foot, besides the Horse, and
all Provisions necessary; and that this Army ought to be commanded by
<hi>Dolobella,</hi> to whom the Senate had given Commission for the Parthian War,
to which <hi>Caesar</hi> had designed it, he began to cast about how to make himself
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:65196:203"/>
Master of it, the rather because of the nearness of places; for it was but
crossing the Ionian Sea, to bring it forthwith into <hi>Italy.</hi> At the same time
a report was raised, that the Getes hearing of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s death made Inroads
into <hi>Macedon,</hi> and spoiled the Province, which gave <hi>Anthony</hi> an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of demanding the Army of the Senate, to chastise the Getes against
whom <hi>Caesar</hi> had intention to employ them before he proceeded on his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
against <hi>Parthia,</hi> where at present all things were quiet. The Senate
slighted not the report, but sent People into the Province to enquire into
the truth; and <hi>Anthony,</hi> utterly to remove all fear and all suspicion that
might be had of him, made a Law whereby all persons were forbid, be it
upon what occasion soever it would, to propose the creating a Dictator, or
to accept of the Dictatorship, and that whoever acted contrary to this Law,
might freely and with impunity be by any one slain. Thus having deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Fathers, and promised by a Treaty made with <hi>Dolobella</hi>'s Friends,
that he would give him one Legion, he was chosen General of the Army
of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and forthwith gave Directions to his Brother <hi>Caius</hi> to make
all speed to the Army with the Ordinance of the Senate. Mean while,
those who had been sent into <hi>Macedon</hi> to inform themselves of the report
spread abroad, being returned, said they had seen no Getes, but added
(whether it were so indeed, or that they were suborned to it by <hi>Anthony</hi>)
that there was reason to fear, that if the Army were drawn out of the
Province, that they would make Inroads. Whilst these things passed at
<hi>Rome, Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> made Levies of Men and Moneys, and <hi>Trebanius</hi>
who commanded in <hi>Asia</hi> fortified those Cities for them. He would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<hi>Dolobella</hi> to enter into <hi>Pergamus,</hi> nor into <hi>Smyrna,</hi> but only gave him a
place without the Walls of <hi>Smyrna</hi> as to a Consul. He, incensed at this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal,
attempted to force the City, wherein not succeeding, <hi>Trebonius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to give him entrance into <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and commanded his people to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Consul at some distance, but they seeing him depart towards the
Dusk of the Evening, thinking there was nothing more to fear, leaving a
few of their companions to follow him, returned to <hi>Smyrna. Dolobella</hi>
laid an ambush for this small company, cut them in pieces, and the same
night finding <hi>Smyrna</hi> defenceless, scaled the Walls, <hi>Trebonius</hi> surprised in
his Bed, began to beg the Soldiers to carry him before the Consul, to whom
he said he would go without constraint. But one of the Centurions mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
told him; <hi>Thou mayst go, but thou must leave thy Head; for we have no
orders to carry thee to the Consul, but to bring him thy Head:</hi> And so in good
earnest cut off his Head, which <hi>Dolobella</hi> as soon as it was day caused to be
placed over the Tribunal, where the Pretor was wont to give audience.
The Soldiers and the Pedees mad against him, because he was a Partner in
the Conspiracy, and had entertained <hi>Anthony</hi> with discourse at the Gate of
the Palace, whilst they slew <hi>Caesar</hi> within, used a thousand indignities to the
rest of his Body, playing with his Head as with a Bowl, which they trowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to one another upon the Pavement, till it was all in pieces. And this
was the first of the Conspirators that was punished.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> Now <hi>Anthony</hi> had a design to bring the Army of <hi>Macedon</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi>
but not finding a pretence to do it, he demanded of the Senate, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of <hi>Macedon</hi> they would give him the Cisalpine <hi>Gaul,</hi> where at present
<hi>Decimus Brutus Albinus</hi> commanded, besides he remembred that <hi>Caesar</hi>
parted from this Province when he began that War wherein he van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
<hi>Pompey.</hi> But now when they saw he would march the Army into
<hi>Gaul,</hi> and not into <hi>Italy,</hi> the Fathers judging he asked this Province only
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65196:203"/>
to serve himself against them, began to make discovery of his ill intentions,
and to repent that they had granted <hi>Macedon:</hi> nay, some of them wrote
particularly to <hi>Decimus,</hi> that he should fortifie himself in his Province, and
make new Levies of what Men and Money he could, left <hi>Anthony</hi> should do
him any violence, so much they feared and hated him together. <hi>Anthony</hi>
therefore refused by the Senate, resolved to carry the Province by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of the People, as formerly <hi>Caesar</hi> had done the same, and <hi>Dolobella</hi>
lately <hi>Syria,</hi> and the more to terrifie the Senate, he sent order to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Caius</hi> forthwith to pass over the Army to <hi>Brundusium.</hi> Mean while
the Aedile <hi>Crotonius</hi> making preparation for the Plays, which he would give
to delight the people, <hi>Caesar</hi> caused a Chair of Gold and a Crown to be
placed for his Father, a thing granted by the Decree of the Senate, to be
done in all Plays to perpetuity. Upon which the Aedile having said that
he would not permit that Honour to <hi>Caesar</hi> in Plays he exhibited at his own
charges, he summoned him before <hi>Anthony</hi> in quality of Consul, and the
Consul saying he would propose the business to the Senate, he angrily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>Propose it then, but in the mean time I will place the Chair there as the
Decree permits. Anthony</hi> incensed with this answer, not only forbid him
to do it at this time, but in some Plays afterwards which <hi>Caesar</hi> himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
in Honour of <hi>Venus,</hi> according to his Father's Institution when he
dedicated to her a Temple in the place and the place it self. This action of
<hi>Anthony</hi>'s begat him the publick hate, as not proceeding so much from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
to the young <hi>Caesar,</hi> as ingratitude to his Father: wherefore <hi>Caesar</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by a multitude of people as his Guards, went through the City,
stirring up against <hi>Anthony</hi> all those who had received benefits from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or born Arms under him, beseeching them not to suffer him to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted
in that manner, nor permit <hi>Anthony</hi> to do so great an injury to their
General and Benefactor, but that they would at least labour for themselves,
for could they be secure of enjoying any thing <hi>Caesar</hi> had given them if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
were deprived of Honours had been granted by Decree of the Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>te?
And when he came into any great place of the City, he might be heard
cry out with a loud voice; <hi>Why am not I the only cause</hi> (Anthony) <hi>that
thou declarest against</hi> Caesar, <hi>and in recompence of so many Benefits received by
thee, returnest on him such violent outrages. Discharge, I beg thee, thy rage
on me alone; but touch not his Goods till the Citizens are payed what he by will
left them. After that, take the rest; for as for my part, though I be poor, I
shall be but too well contented to be Heir to the Glory of my Father, and of his
liberality to his Citizens, provided it may not be unprofitable to them.</hi> Upon
this discourse the whole multitude drew together, and cryed out
publickly against <hi>Anthony.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Anthony</hi> having uttered
some bitter threats against <hi>Caesar,</hi> and what he threatened coming
to publick knowledge, Mens minds were the more inflamed against
him; insomuch that the very Officers of his Guards who had born
Arms under <hi>Caesar,</hi> and who were at present in great esteem with
the Consul, besought him to be no more so vigorous, both for their sakes
and his own proper interest, he having himself had command under<hi>Caesar,</hi>
and being obliged to him for his fortune. <hi>Anthony</hi> acknowledging that what
they said was true, and besides considering that he stood in need of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s
credit with the people to obtain the Government of <hi>Gaul,</hi> yielded to
their Remonstrance, swearing that he was not ingrateful towards <hi>Caesar,</hi>
and that he had manifested this change of affection to no other end, but
that a young Man a little too haughty for his age, and who bore no respect
either to Ancients or Magistrates should somewhat stand corrected; for
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65196:204"/>
that in good truth he had need of correction, but yet for the Prayers sake
they had made him, he would lay aside all animosity and resume his former
inclinations, provided <hi>Caesar</hi> would for the future be more moderate. The
Tribunes satisfied with this answer, engaged them to an Enterview, where
after some complaints of of one another they were reconciled.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> Soon after, <hi>Anthony</hi> preferred the Decree touching the Government of
<hi>Gaul.</hi> The Senate were afraid, and took a resolution to hinder it, if the
Consul demanded their approbation, and to oppose it by means of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes,
if without speaking to the Senate he sought to have it ratifyed by the
people. Nay, there were some Senators of opinion to set that Province at
liberty, so formidable seemed it to them, because lying so near <hi>Rome. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
on the other side reproached them that they had given that Province
to <hi>Decimus</hi> one of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Murderers, and yet made a difficulty of trusting
him with it, because he had not murdered him that conquered it, and
brought it under their obedience, by which he accused them of openly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the action. The day for approbation of the Decree being come,
the Senate had given orders that the Votes should be taken by the Tribes,
but those of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Party having assembled the people before day, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them of purpose by Centuries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Though the multitude had an aversion
for <hi>Anthony,</hi> yet forbore they not now to favour him for <hi>Caesar</hi>'s sake, who
was present at the assembly soliciting for him out of fear, left <hi>Decimus</hi> one
of those who slew his Father should command with an Army in so commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
a Province, and likewise to gratifie <hi>Anthony</hi> with whom he was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reconciled, and from whom in his turn he expected some favour. In
short, the Tribunes of the People not at all opposing it, for <hi>Anthony</hi> had
gained them, the Decree was ratifyed, and the Consul having now a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
pretence caused the Army to pass over into <hi>Italy.</hi> At length one of
the Tribunes being dead, and <hi>Caesar</hi> soliciting for <hi>Flaminius</hi> who made suit
for this Dignity; the people imagining that he did indeed desire it for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but durst not ask it because he was too young, would needs by
Vote declare him Tribune: on the other side, the Senate envyed him this
increase of Honour, as fearing left being made Tribune he should summon
before the people those who had slain his Father. Whereupon <hi>Anthony</hi>
violating the Friendship he had newly sworn to <hi>Caesar,</hi> or in favour of the
Senate, whom he would fain appease, because they were offended at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of the People concerning <hi>Gaul,</hi> issued a Decree of the Consul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he prohibited <hi>Caesar</hi> from conserring Liberalities upon any person contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Law, upon pain of punishment. This Decree which made appear
<hi>Anthony</hi>'s ingratitude to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and which was injurious both to the young
<hi>Caesar</hi> and the people, stirred up the minds of the multitude, and it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
likely, that at the Assembly to be called, some tumult would happen,
so that <hi>Anthony</hi> himself was afraid, and contenting himself with the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Tribunes already in the City, prevented the assembling of the
People. As for <hi>Caesar,</hi> seeing that <hi>Anthony</hi> declared openly against him,
he dispatched people throughout the colonies that he had established, to
let them know the wrong he suffered, and to sound their inclinations. He
sent likewise some of his Confidents to <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Army, mixed among those
who had the Convoy of Provisions, giving them orders to do their utmost
to draw the bravest to his side, and privily to drop Libels among the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.
Whilst <hi>Caesar</hi> was thus employed, the same Officers of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s
Guards before mentioned laying hold on the occasion spoke to him in this
manner:</p>

                           <p>We have a certain knowledge that Caesar's Murderers hate us as much
as him, us and all those who under his command have extended the
bounds of the Roman Empire, and yet dayly employ all their power to extend
them; that we are exposed to their Ambushes, and that the Senate favours
them. Nevertheless, after their being chased hence by the People we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained
courage, seeing Caesar was not destitute of Friends, who still remembred
his Benefits, and preserved their acknowledgments. But above all, we are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of the Friendship between you, and of your experience in War, being the
greatest Captain of the Age next him, and the most capable to command. But
because our Enemies springing up afresh, endeavour to seise upon <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi>
and make Levies of Men and Money to wage War upon us, because the
Senate causes <hi>Decimus</hi> to prepare againsh you, and that in the mean all your
thoughts and cares are employed in the differences you have with the young Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar
we fear, and not without reason, that in the War now threatening us, nay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which indeed we have upon us, there happen not some division amongst us, which
may cause our Enemies to succeed in their Enterprises. Wherefore we intreat
you, that in acknowledgments of Caesar's Favours and Benefits, for the common
security of all us, against whom you have never yet had cause of complaint, and
likewise for your own interest, you assist Casar to take vengeance of the Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of his Father, whilst it is in your power to do it, he will be therewith content,
and you will afterwards live without trouble, and we discharged of our fears for
you, and for our selves.</p>

Guards.</head>
                           <p>You know with what passion I always loved <hi>Caesar</hi> as long as he lived,
and that there were no dangers to which I exposed not my self to
Preserve his Authority. You know it, I say, you who followed him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where, and were present at all his Action: and I grant there is no
need of Witness to prove that his Affection and Esteem forme lasted to his
very end. His Murderers having perfect knowledge of all this, had
once resolved to have dispatched me at the same time, believing whilst I
remained alive they could never perfectly accomplish their design; and
he that diverted them from these thoughts did it not for my sake, but to
give a fairer Gloss to their crime, that it might be thought they designed
not so much to revenge themselves of many Enemies, as to kill one Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
Who then would think after so many obligations as I have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65196:205"/>
from <hi>Caesar,</hi> I should range my self on his Enemies Party, or that I
should willingly pardon his death to those who attempted my own life, as
the young <hi>Caesar</hi> imagines? How then after Indemnity did they obtain
Governments? for you impute to me this fault which the Senate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
Hearken a little how it happened: <hi>Caesar</hi> being slain in full Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, fear seised all the world, and my self more than any one, because I
was his Friend, and yet knew not exactly whether there were a Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
or who were the Conspirators. The People were in tumult, the
Murderers had gained the Capitol with the Gladiators, and suffered no
one to enter, the Senate favoured them, which to this day they do, and
were ready to decree them rewards, as having slain a Tyrant, which if it
had come to pass, we must have all resolved to perish as that Tyrants
Friends. in the midst of all this turmoil, fear and trouble, 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if I lost my Judgment: however, if you weigh the extremity in
which I was with what I have done, you will find I neither wanted bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the midst of danger, nor policy when there was a necessity to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble.
The main thing in this Affair, and on which depended all the
rest, was the prevention of their decreeing rewards to the Murderers,
in which I so obstinately held out, that at last I carried it in despite of the
Senate and all the Conspirators, yet not without running the hazard of
losing my life; for I judged, that if I only obtained that <hi>Caesar</hi> were not
declared Tyrant, we were all in safety. But whereas our Enemies and the
Senate feared on their side, that if <hi>Caesar</hi> were not declared Tyrant, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
might issue out against those that slew him, and therefore would
stand stifly to the having it done, I consented that the Amnesty might
be granted to them, but not the Rewards; nor had I done it, but that I
might obtain on my part what I desired, and which was of no small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.
That the name of <hi>Caesar,</hi> dearer to me than all things in the
world, might not be abolished; that his Goods might not be confiscate:
that that adoption which makes this young man so insolent, might not be
cancelled: that his Will might be ratified: that his Body might be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
with Funerals worthy a King: that the Honours decreed him
might endure to perpetuity: that all that he had done might be approved;
and that his Son, and we his Friends, his Captains and his Soldiers might
be secured in our persons, and honoured by all the World, instead of
that infamy wherewith we were threatened. Do you believe after all
this, that in lieu of the Amnesty to which I gave my hand, the Senate
granted me a small matter; or do you think they would have granted it
if I had not consented to the Amnesty? And though this exchange had
been sincerely made, what had I lost by really granting the Murderers a
pardon of their crime, thereby to render <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Glory immortal, and
put our lives in security: yet was not that my intention. I did but only
defer their punishment; for as soon as I obtained of the Senate what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
and that the Murderers were freed from their inquietude, I took
courage, and abrogated the Amnesty, not by sentence of the Senate, nor
by decree of the People (for that could not be done) but by a popular
blaze, which underhand I kindled, by causing <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Body to be brought
into the place, under pretence of celebrating his Funerals, and there by
opening his wounds, and shewing his Robe pierced through, and bloody,
to excite compassion in the multitude, praising his Virtues, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the love he had for his Country, and in short, Mourning for him, as
dead, yet invoking him as a God: for what I said, and what I did, so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
the multitude, that not considering the Amnesty, they took fire,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65196:205"/>
and carrying it to our Enemies Houses, drove them out of <hi>Rome.</hi> This
was done in spite of the Senate, and they testified their resentment of it,
by accusing me of courting the popular favour, by sending the Murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
into the Provinces, <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> into <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Macedon,</hi> where
they had great Armies: nor did they let them stay out the time they
ought to have done, but advanced it by a feigned Commission they gave
them of sending Corn to the City. Hereupon I found my self surprised
with a new fear, and not having any Army whereof I could dispose, I
was afraid lest we unarmed should be assailed by so many armed Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
I had some suspicion of my Colleague, with whom I had no right
understanding, and whom I might very well believe an Accomplice in
the Conspiracy, being come to the City the day that it was executed.
In this troublesome Conjuncture I thought it a matter of importance to
disarm our Enemies, and to seise on their Arms, to which end I caused
<hi>Amatius</hi> to be put to death, and recalled<hi>Pompey,</hi> that by this means I
might oblige the Senate to take my part: yet not being thereby fully as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
I perswaded <hi>Dolobella</hi> to demand <hi>Syria</hi> not from the Senate, but
from the people, and I upheld him in this Enterprise, that from a Friend
to the Conspirators, as he now was, he might become their Enemy;
and that after my Colleague had obtained <hi>Syria,</hi> the Senate might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to deny me <hi>Macedon,</hi> which however they had not granted me
by reason of the Army that was then in that Province, if they had not
before given that same Army to <hi>Dolobella,</hi> who besides the Government
of <hi>Syria</hi> had got the Commission to make War against the Parthians:
nor had they consented to the taking away <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Macedon</hi> from <hi>Cassius</hi>
and <hi>Brutus,</hi> if for their security other Governments had not been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
them, instead of those whereof they were dispossessd. It was
therefore necessary and must be done, but pray observe what comparison
there is between those Provinces taken from them, and those wherewith
they were recompensed. <hi>Cyrene</hi> and <hi>Crete</hi> were assigned them, so unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
of Forces, that they themselves have despised them, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to seise by force of those taken from them. Thus the Command
of the Army is passed from the Enemy to <hi>Dolobella</hi> by my policy, and by
fair exchange; for no person having yet taken up Arms, we must follow
the Laws. After this, the Enemies having set on foot another Army,
I had occasion for the Legions of <hi>Macedon,</hi> but to get them wanted op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
whereupon a report was spread, that the Getes had in a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile
manner invaded the Province, which not being altogether believed,
some were sent to enquire the certainty. During which time I caused an
Ordinance to be published, by which it was forbid to speak of a Dictator,
to make any proposition tending to it, or so much as to accept of the
Dictatorship; whereby the Senate, perswaded of my good intentions,
gave me the Command of the Army; so that at present I find my self
strong enough to defend my self against my Enemies, not only against
those already declared, as <hi>Caesar</hi> imagines, but against a multitude of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
more powerful, who will not yet discover themselves. Having
put my Affairs into this Kingdom, I had yet left sticking (as I may say)
in my very Ribs one of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Murderers, to wit, <hi>Decimus Brutus,</hi> who
commanded a great Army in a very commodious Province; and because
I knew him capable of Action, that I might remove him thence by some
fair pretence, I made an offer in the Senate to give him <hi>Macedon</hi> in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
after having drawn thence the Legions. The Senate opposing it
upon some mistrust they had of my designs, and many of that Body having
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65196:206"/>
writ many things as you know to <hi>Decimus,</hi> be sides that they were ready
to stir up against me the Consuls, for the next year I took a resolution to
speak no more of it to the Senate, but to demand this Province from the
People, and to make the Macedonian Army pass over to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> to
employ them in things necessary, and I hope yet by the assistance of the
Gods to make use of them to the advantage of my Affairs when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion requires. Thus from the fear wherein we formerly were, we
have reached that security we desired, and a condition to strike terrour
into our Enemies, though when we first took up Arms many declared for
them; yet now you see they repent of their sentences given in my favour,
that they use all their endeavours to deprive me of the Government of
<hi>Gaul</hi> granted me by the People. You know they continually write to
<hi>Decimus,</hi> that they solicite the Consuls to cancel by sentence the Decree
which gives me that Province. But for my part, resting assured on the
assistance of the Gods, Protectors of my Country, on the sincerity of
my intentions, and on your valour which made <hi>Caesar</hi> every where victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
I will employ all my soul and all my strength to revenge him. It
was necessary, Fellow Soldiers, till now to keep these things secret;
but since you ought to have share in all my Actions, and all my Designs,
I am content to discover them to you, and you may communicate them
to all those tied by the same interest, except only to<hi>Caesar,</hi> whose ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
I have already made proof of.</p>

                  <hi>Anthony</hi>'s officers become firmly perswaded by these words, that all the
artifices he had made use of to deceive the Senate, proceeded only from the
passion he had to destroy the Murderers. However, they prevailed with
him to reconcile himself with <hi>Caesar,</hi> which he did in the Capitol.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> Some time after <hi>Anthony</hi> caused to be brought into an Assembly of his
Friends some of his Guards, as if <hi>Caesar</hi> would have treated with them to
murder him, whether it were a calumny, of whether he believed it indeed,
or whether (having intelligence that <hi>Caesar</hi> had sent some People amongst
his Troops) he imagined it was to make an attempt upon his life. The ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of this attempt was spread through the whole City, and raised a
mighty Tumult, and the People were filled with great indignation; for
some persons sounding more deeply into the business, saw well that <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
though he was an Enemy to <hi>Caesar,</hi> yet was useful to him, because the
Conspirators feared him, who, if he had been dead had been capable of
enterprising any thing, especially supported as they were by the Senate,
and this was the judgment of the wiser sort. But with the greather part of
the multitude who beheld <hi>Caesar</hi> every day suffering a thousand wrongs it
was no hard matter to believe the calumny, and they adjudged it an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
sign to make an attempt upon the person of a Consul. Upon the
noise of it <hi>Caesar</hi> ran through all the Streets like a mad man, crying out, that
on the contrary it was a plot laid by <hi>Anthony</hi> himself to rob him of the
good opinion of the People, by whose favour he had hitherto subsisted.
He went to <hi>Anthony</hi>'s own Gates, crying the same thing, attesting the Gods,
and making imprecations on himself, and requiring them to issue out his
Process: and when no person came out of the House, <hi>I will,</hi> said he, <hi>make
thy own Friends Iudges.</hi> And therewithal endeavoured to enter, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed,
he began to complain, revile, and grow angry against those who
hindred his entrance, telling them 'twas for fear he should convince <hi>Anthony</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:65196:206"/>
of calumny, and so retiring immediately, he protested before all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that if any mischief happened to him, it ought to be attributed to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the perfidiousness of <hi>Anthony.</hi> These words pronounced
with vehemence changed the minds of the Multitude, and many began to
repent themselves of the opinion they had entertained of him. Though
some were doubtful which of the two to credit; and others affirmed 'twas
all but a plot laid between themselves in the Temple where they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,
that by a seeming Feud they might better surprise their Enemies:
whilst others again said, that it was <hi>Anthony</hi>'s invention only, that under
this pretence he might encrease his Guards, and turn away the old Soldiers
hearts from <hi>Caesar.</hi> At the same time intelligence was privately given to
<hi>Caesar,</hi> that both the Army arrived at <hi>Brundusium</hi> and the old Soldiers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
into Colonies were incensed against <hi>Anthony,</hi> because he delayed
the revenging of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s death, which they offered to employ all their
power to effect, and that upon this occasion the Consul was gone to <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusium,</hi>
which obliged <hi>Caesar,</hi> who was fearful lest his Enemy returning to
<hi>Rome</hi> which and Army might oppress him defenceless as he was, to take store
of Money, and go into <hi>Campania</hi> to engage in his service those Colonies
there settled by his Father. First <hi>Galatia,</hi> and then <hi>Silia</hi> situate on both
sides of <hi>Capua</hi> gave him their word: and by advancing five hundred Drams
to each Soldier he raised about ten thousand Men, who were not so well
furnished as was requisite for the War, nor enrolled in Companies and
Regiments, but marched all under one Standard as his Guards. And
whereas those in the City were frightned before with the thoughts of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>'s
return with an Army, hearing of <hi>Ceasar</hi>'s coming at the Head of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
some were now afraid of both, others again were well satisfied
with the imagination they might employ <hi>Caesar</hi> to defend them against <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony;</hi>
and others again who had been witnesses of their reconciliation in
the Capitol, believed all but a fiction, and that they were agreed together
to joyn Forces, to the end, <hi>Anthony</hi> might seise on the Sovereign Authority,
and <hi>Caesar</hi> revenge the death of his Father. In the heart of this Allarm,
<hi>Carnutius</hi> Tribune of the People, Enemy to <hi>Anthony,</hi> and friend to <hi>Caesar,</hi>
went out to meet his Friend, and understanding his intentions, came and
assured the People that <hi>Caesar</hi> had took up Arms against none but <hi>Anthony</hi>
his declared Enemy, and that to secure themselves from <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Tyranny
it was requisite to joyn with <hi>Caesar,</hi> the rather because in that Conjuncture
they had no other Army. After this Remonstrance he caused <hi>Caesar,</hi> who had lodgd the night before in the Temple of <hi>Mars,</hi> fifteen Furlongs from
<hi>Rome,</hi> to advance into the City, where, as soon as he was entred, he went
and possessed himself of the Temple of <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> about which all
the old Soldiers gathered together with their Swords under their Coats.
There <hi>Carnutius</hi> having first made an invective againg <hi>Anthony</hi> in full As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
<hi>Caesar</hi> proceeded to put them in remembrance of his Father's Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and the injuries which himself had received from <hi>Anthony,</hi> to defend
himself from which, and to secure his own person, he had been necessitated
to raise an Army, which he promised to employ for his Countrys service
wherever there should be an occasion, and particularly against <hi>Anthony,</hi>
who was at present in Arms. After there Discourfes the People being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired,
the Soldiers, whose design of coming thither had been only the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony,</hi> or at utmost to defend <hi>Caesar,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the death of his Father, were amazed at his promising their service
against <hi>Anthony,</hi> who had formerly been their General, and was at present
Consul; whereupon some desired leave to return home, under pretence of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65196:207"/>
fetching their Arms, because they could ill do Service with other Arms
than those they had been used to; others spoke openly what they thought.
<hi>Caesar</hi> seeing the matter succeeded quite contrary to his expectation, was
somewhat startled: Yet hoping to gain them rather by fair means than
force, he granted what they desired; sending some home to fetch their
Arms, and dismissing others without any condition. Though this Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
infinitely troubled him, he kept all to himself; and instead of seeming
concerned at it, thanking them for the Assistance they had given him, made
them a Present of more Money, promising to be more liberal for the future;
because if any Accident happened which might oblige him to make use of
an Army, he had rather confide in them as his Father's Friends, than em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
other Soldiers. This Carriage might, one would think, have won
them; and yet of ten thousand that they were, only one thousand, or as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
say, three thousand (for the number is not certain) stayed with him,
and all the rest went their way. However, some, after considering the toil
of the Plough, and the Profits they had received, and what they hoped for
the future, as Vulgar Spirits are subject to Change, they repented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and laying hold of the plausible pretence of being only come home
to fetch their Arms, of their own mere motion they all returned armed to
<hi>Caesar;</hi> who having taken more Money with him, was gone to <hi>Ravenna</hi> and
the neighbouring places; where he incessantly listed Men, daily increasing
his Forces: whose Rendezvouz he appointed at <hi>Aresia.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Arezzo.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> Mean time of the five Legions that were in <hi>Macedon,</hi> four were come to
the Consul, who angred that he had so long delayed revenging <hi>Caesar</hi>'s death,
brought him without any Acclamations to the Tribunal, as if before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things they would be satisfied in the reasons of this delay. He offended
at their silence, could not forbear reproaching them of ingratitude, in not
considering how much more advantagious it was for them to bear Arms in
<hi>Italy,</hi> than against the Parthians. He complained likewise that they had
not brought him those Disturbers of the Peace which that young Giddy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brains
(for so he called <hi>Caesar</hi>) had sent amongst them; whom, however, he
himself should find out: That as for his Army, he was going to lead them
into the happy Province of <hi>Gaul,</hi> the Government of which he had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and would give to every Soldier one hundred Drams. They all burst
out a laughing at the meanness of this promise; at which he appearing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
the Tumult increased, and all began to leave him. Whereupon,
rising up himself, he only said these words, <hi>You shall learn to obey.</hi> And
hereupon he after gave Command to the Tribunes to bring him the Roll of
the Mutineers (for in the Roman Armies every Soldier is enrolled in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
that he might decimate them according to Military Discipline. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
he punished not every tenth Man, but only put a part of them to death,
thinking to terrifie them a little; though by this Action he raised more their
anger than their fear. <hi>Caesar</hi>'s people whom he had sent to corrupt the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
observing this discontent in the Army, began afresh to scatter abroad
their Libels, by which they displayed to the Soldiers the Cruelty and Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
of <hi>Anthony;</hi> and withal, representing to them the Clemency of the first
<hi>Caesar,</hi> invited them to make tryal of the Liberality of the young Man. And
though the Consul proposed great Rewards to those who discovered them,
and threatned with exemplary Punishment such as harbored them, he
could get no advice who they were; which infinitely troubled him, as
doubting the whole Army had intelligence with them. Soon after upon the
report brought him of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s proceedings in the Colonies and at <hi>Rome,</hi> he
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65196:207"/>
was more concerned, and came forth once more to speak to the Soldiers.
He said, <hi>It troubled him that he had been forced to punish some, though it had
been fewer than Military Discipline required, and that they knew well that</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony
<hi>was neither covetous nor cruel. But, <hi>said he,</hi> let us talk no more of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions,
or Faults, or Punishments; we will forget all that is past. And as
for the hundred Drams a Head I promised you, I would not have you think I
meant it as a Donative, that were below the Fortune of</hi> Anthony; <hi>you shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that only as an Earnest of my Favour at our first Meeting, but remember
that both now and hereafter I desire you would obey me according to the Roman
Law of War.</hi> After having made an end of speaking he gave them not any
thing more, lest he should seem to prejudice his Quality of General by yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
too much to his Army; And they likewise acquiesced in the promises
he made them, either as repenting of what they had done, or out of fear;
yet he changed their Officers, either because they had encouraged the Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or out of some suspition he had of them: But as for the Soldiers, he
treated them afterwards more favourably in all occasions they had to petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. He caused them to march along the Sea-Coasts towards <hi>Rimini</hi> one
after another; but for himself, having chosen out the properest and brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Men he could find among all the Legions, and formed them into a<note n="*" place="margin">Pretorian Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort.</note> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of Guards; he took his way towards <hi>Rome,</hi> from thence intending
to go meet the Legions. Being come nigh to <hi>Rome</hi> he quartered his Horse
in the Suburbs, and with his Foot entred the City in a posture as if he had an
Enemy to engage; causing them to keep Guard about his House, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word, and dividing the Watches as if he had been in the Field.
Soon after having summoned a Senate to make his Complaint of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes,
News was brought him to the Palace Gate that one of the four
Legions, called the Legion of <hi>Mars,</hi> was revolted to that young Captain.
Whereupon, being at a stand, and perplexed in mind, another Messenger
came to tell him that the fourth Legion had followed the Martial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
put him into such a fright, that only entring the Palace as though he
had called together the Fathers for some other reasons, he said little to them,
but speedily going out of the City, marched directly towards <hi>Alba,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to regain those that had deserted his Party; but seeing they shot at
him from the Walls, he sent five hundred Drams a Man to the rest; and
brought those Forces he had, with all his Train of Munition ordinarily used
in War, to <hi>Tivoli,</hi> for the War was already declared, <hi>Decimus</hi> having refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to part with <hi>Gaul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He had not been long at <hi>Tivoli,</hi> but almost all the Senate, a great part of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/>
the Knights, and many of the most considerable of the People came to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement
and give him Testimonies of their Good Will. And as there he
was administring the Oath to the Soldiers he had with him, and likewise to
the Veterans, a great number of which were come voluntarily to joyn with
him, they of their own accord swore with the rest, and promised him Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
so that it seemed a wonder where those Men were who a little before
had so fiercely declaimed against him in the presence of <hi>Caesar.</hi> Thus <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
magnificently accompanied, advanced towards <hi>Rimini,</hi> a City scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
on the Entrance into <hi>Gaul.</hi> Besides his new Levies, he had three Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian
Legions (for the fifth was now arrived) and a great number of Vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,
whom he esteemed as much again as his new Soldiers. So that he
found his Strength to consist in four Legions, all tryed Men, with their
Horse and Light-armed Foot; without reckoning the Regiment of Guards,
and the Soldiers newly entertained. Besides, <hi>Lepidus</hi> was in <hi>Spain</hi> with
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65196:208"/>
four Legions, <hi>Asinius Pollio</hi> with two, and <hi>Plancus</hi> in the Transalpine <hi>Gaul</hi>
with three; all which would in all appearance side with <hi>Anthony.</hi> As for <hi>Caesar,</hi>
his Force consisted of those two Legions revolted from <hi>Anthony,</hi> one of the
new Soldiers, and two of Veterans, which would not have been compleat,
had he not filled them up with New. Having rendezvouzed them at <hi>Alba,</hi>
he gave advice thereof to the Senate, who extremely rejoyced at it; so that
now again it was hard to find out the Men that had accompanied <hi>Anthony.</hi>
Not but that they were troubled that these Legions had not rather yielded to
themselves than to <hi>Caesar.</hi> However, after having applauded their Good
Will, and that of the other Legions, they promised that as soon as the new
Magistrates were entred upon their Charge they would employ them in such
things as should be effectually for the Good of the Republick. Now it was
apparent their hopes were to employ these Forces against <hi>Anthony,</hi> having
no other particular Army, nor having power to raise one without the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Consuls; wherefore they temporized till such time as the new
Officers were entred upon the Management of Affairs. Mean time <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
Soldiers offered him Axes and Lictors; beseeching him to take the Title of
Propretor, and command them in that Quality, because they were accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to pay their Obedience to Magistrates. He much applauded them for
the Honour they would have conferred on him, but remitted the matter to
the Senate's discretion. Nor could all the Entreaties they made him prevail
with him to consent, but so far as that they might send Deputies to <hi>Rome</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it; telling them, <hi>The Senate will of themselves the more willingly confer
upon me this Dignity when they shall hear that you offered it me, and I would
not accept it.</hi> At length, though with much difficulty, he prevailed over
them. And when the Officers complained to him that it was a kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising
them, he gave them these reasons for his Conduct. <hi>The Senate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
on my side, not out of any kindness to me, but because they are afraid of</hi> Anthony, <hi>and have at present no Army; they only wait till</hi> Anthony <hi>be defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and that the Murderers of my Father, who are Kindred and Friends to
most of the Senate, have drawn together their Forces; which being so easie to be
perceived, I dissemble a Submission to them, and it is requisite they should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that Opinion of me: But should I usurp the Title of Magistrate, they
would accuse me of Treason and Violence, whilst governing my self with modesty,
they will perhaps of their own motion give it me for fear lest I should accept it
from you.</hi> Having spoken in this manner, he went to see the two revolted
Legions exercise; who performed one against the other all that could be
practised in a Fight, except killing, in such an excellent manner, that <hi>Caesar</hi>
was infinitely pleased with the sight of it; and taking thence occasion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
his Liberality, he gave once more to every Soldier five hundred Drams,
with promise that in case there was a necessity of their engaging in Fight,
and he gained the Victory, he would give them each five thousand; by
which Bounty he engaged them to attempt any thing for his Service.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> Mean time <hi>Anthony</hi> being marched into <hi>Gaul,</hi> had sent his Commands
to <hi>Decimus</hi> to go for <hi>Macedon,</hi> according to the Decree of the People, and
for his own safety. Whereupon <hi>Decimus</hi> sent him the Senate's Letters, and
Word withal, that <hi>Decimus</hi> ought no less obedience to the Orders of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
than did <hi>Anthony</hi> to the Decrees of the People. And when <hi>Anthony</hi>
had fixed a day, on which if he departed not the Province he would treat
him as an Enemy, <hi>Decimus</hi> desired him to prolong that time, for fear lest
before that himself might be declared Enemy of his Country. After this,
though <hi>Anthony</hi> might easily have defeated <hi>Decimus</hi> his Army, which now
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:65196:208"/>
kept the Field, yet he chose rather to go about to the Cities, not any of
which refused him their Gates. Whereupon <hi>Decimus,</hi> afraid lest he should
find none to give him entrance, feigned to have received Orders from the
Senate to return with his Army to <hi>Rome,</hi> and took his March towards <hi>Italy.</hi>
All the Cities in his way received him as only pretending to pass through;
but when he came to <hi>Modena,</hi> a Noble City, he shut the Gates, seized on
the Stores of the Inhabitants for Provisions for his Army, killed and salted
up all the Baggage Horse for the same use in case the length of the Siege op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
him: And now become Master of a great number of Gladiators,
and three Legions; one of which were New Levied Men, and the other
two having served formerly under him, very affectionate to him, he in that
Post expected <hi>Anthony;</hi> who presently came in great rage before the place,
and began to work in the Circumvallation of it. <hi>Decimus</hi> being in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
besieged, the very first day of the next Year the new Consuls, <hi>Hirtius</hi>
and <hi>Pansa,</hi> after the usual Sacrifices, assembled the Senate in the same
Temple, to consult about the Affairs with <hi>Anthony.</hi> There <hi>Cicero</hi> and those
of his Cabal advised the declaring him an Enemy to his Country, for that
he had seized by force, and in despight of the Senate, of <hi>Gaul,</hi> to the end he
might fortifie himself against his Country; and for having drawn into <hi>Italy</hi>
that Army they had given him Command of against the Thracians. They
added, that he aspired to Supreme Dominion after <hi>Cesar;</hi> having been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
attended through the City by Soldiers as Guards of his Body, having
fortifyed his House like a Cittadel; and in summ, behaved himself in many
things with more Pride and Insolence than became a Magistrate, whose
Power was to continue but a Year. But <hi>L. Piso,</hi> one of the most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had Charge of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Affairs in his absence,
with others, Friends to him or <hi>Anthony,</hi> or else seriously thinking what they
spoke; said, That they ought first to Cite him to stand to a Tryal, and not
condemn a Roman Citizen without a Hearing. Besides, that it would be a
shameful thing to declare that Man Enemy to his Country to day, who had
yesterday been Consul; especially after such publick Applauses of so many
several Persons, and even of <hi>Cicero</hi> himself. Thus the Senate spent that day
in debate, without concluding any thing. The next Morning the Fathers
assembled very early in the Palace, where <hi>Ciecro</hi>'s Party proved the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
so that <hi>Anthony</hi> was upon the point of being declared Enemy by Decree,
if <hi>Salvius,</hi> Tribune of the People, had not hindred, and put a stop to the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair;
for among these Officers, he whose Voice opposes carries it. <hi>Cicero</hi>'s
Party fretted at these Proceedings, bitterly reviled him; and running to
the place to stir up the Multitude against him, assigned him to give in the
Reasons of his Opposition before the People. He went without any fear;
but the Senate hindred him out of a doubt left he should pervert the People
by putting them in mind of <hi>Anthony.</hi> For the Fathers knew well they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
an Illustrious Person without bringing him to a Tryal; and that the
Province, for the Usurpation of which they condemned him, had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him by the People: Only their fear for the Conspirators made them
bear ill Will to <hi>Anthony,</hi> who had frustrated the Indempnity granted them
by the Senate; and for this reason they had joyned with the young <hi>Caesar</hi>
against him: To which <hi>Caesar,</hi> who perceived their intentions, had easily
consented, being willing first to get rid of <hi>Anthony.</hi> But though the Senate
were thus animated against him, they delayed giving Judgment because of
the Opposition of the Tribune. Notwithstanding, a Sentence passed by
which they approved the Action of <hi>Decimus,</hi> in not delivering up <hi>Gaul</hi> to
<hi>Anthony:</hi> To which they added, that joyntly with <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Pansa, Caesar</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:65196:209"/>
should command the Forces he already had; that a Statue of Gold should
be erected for him; that for the future he should have a Voice among Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Consular Degree, and have Right to demand the Consulate ten Years
before the time prescribed by the Laws; and that the Donative <hi>Caesar</hi> had
promised to the two Legions revolted from <hi>Anthony</hi> if they gained the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
should be payed out of the publick Treasury. These things thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
on, the Senate broke up as if <hi>Anthony</hi> had in effect been declared E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
and that the Tribune could find nothing more to say on the morrow.
But <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Mother, Wife and Son (yet very young) with their Friends
and Domesticks, run about all night to the Houses of the Senators, to solicite
them in his behalf. And Day being come, they plucked them by the Robe
as they passed along to the Senate; and all together in mourning Habit, as
the Fathers entred the Palace, cast themselves at their Feet before the Gate,
weeping and lamenting like despairing Persons. So that these sad Objects
and this suddain Change had already stirred up a Sence of Pity in the Breasts
of most of the Judges; when <hi>Cicero</hi> fearing the Success of the Affair, spoke
to them in this manner.</p>

                           <p>We passed yesterday what we had to decree in the Case of <hi>Anthony;</hi> for by
declaring his Enemies worthy of Honour and Recompence, we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
declared him Enemy to his Country. As for <hi>Salvius,</hi> who alone opposes, it
follows, that either he is wiser than us all, or that he does it out of Friendship, or
else understands not the present state of Affairs. Now it were a shameful thing
to have all of us together thought to have less Wisdom than one single Man, and
it would prove dishonourable to <hi>Salvius</hi> to prefer a private Friendship before pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Good; we are then to believe that he knows not the state of Affairs: but he
ought not to give credit to his own Iudgment before that of so many Consuls, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
Tribunes, his Colleagues, and all the rest of the Senators; who being so nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
and so great Men both for Age and Experience, known <hi>Anthony</hi> better
than <hi>Salvius</hi> can do; for in all Iudgments, that Sentence that is carried by most
Voices ought to be esteemed most just. However, if he still have a desire to hear
now the Reasons of our Iudgment, I will repeat the principal of them in few
words. <hi>Anthony</hi> has seized himself of our Treasure after the death of <hi>Caesar:</hi>
Having obtained from us the Government of <hi>Macedon,</hi> he is marched into <hi>Gaul</hi>
without the Senate's Order: We gave him an Army to oppose the Thracians, and
he, instead of employing it against them, has brought it into <hi>Italy</hi> against our
selves: And has done things by his own Authority after having, to put a Cheat
upon us, asked our consent, and been denyed it by the Iudgment of all the World.
Being at <hi>Brundusium</hi> he took a Regiment of Guards like a King, and has been
publickly attended by his Soldiers through the City, placed Guards about his House,
and given them the Word, as in time of War: He had likewise ordered the rest
of his Forces hither; and was putting himself in a posture of doing with more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence
than the first <hi>Caesar</hi> the same things that he had done. But being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the young <hi>Caesar,</hi> who had another Army, he was afraid, and went to
possess himself of <hi>Gaul,</hi> as on a Province convenient for his designs; from whence
Caesar fell into <hi>Italy,</hi> and made himself Master of us and the Republick. To
these ends it is he terrifies the Soldiers with his Cruelty, to make them obedient to
whatever he has a mind to; to this end he decimated not Mutineers nor Run-a-ways,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65196:209"/>
on whom only the Law admits that Punishment to be inflicted, and which
few Commanders have done but in dangerous Wars and in extreme necessity;
whilst he for a fit of laughter puts Citizens to death, not the Guilty, but the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate.
This Cruelty has occasioned those who could escape to leave him (and
yesterday you decreed them Recompence as for a good Action) and those who are yet
stayed with him do it for fear, and now by his Orders plunder your Province, and
besiege your Army and your Pretor, to whom you have written that he should stay
in the Province; and <hi>Anthony</hi> will have him thence. Why do we not then with
Alacrity declare <hi>Anthony</hi> our Enemy, who already makes War upon us? But
this is what the Tribune will not know, till such time as he has defeated <hi>Decimus,</hi>
and made himself Master, together with that great Province which lies so near
us, of <hi>Decimus</hi> his Army; with hopes thereby more easily to oppress us. Then
perhaps the Tribune will consent that he should be declared Enemy; but he would
have us stay till he be too powerful for us.</p>

                           <p>THe Laws (Conscript Fathers) require that the Accused should hear his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/>
impleaded before him; and after having made answer, expect his
Sentence: This is what <hi>Cicero,</hi> that mighty Accuser, cannot deny me. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
since he has not accused <hi>Anthony</hi> of any thing while he was present, but would
now value himself upon this opportunity of his absence to blacken him with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Crimes, I present my self to make appear the falsity of his Accusations;
which I hope to do in few words. In the first place he says that after <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
death, <hi>Anthony</hi> seized upon the publick Moneys; but the Laws have ordained
particular Punishments for Thieves, but never declared them Enemies to their
Country. Besides, <hi>Brutus</hi> having slain <hi>Caesar</hi> accused him in a publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the People of having wasted the Publick Treasure, and drained dry the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer.
Some time after <hi>Anthony</hi> ordered an Inquisition to be made; you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
his Ordinance, and promised the tenth Penny to the Discoverers; and we
submit our selves to pay double if any one can convict <hi>Anthony</hi> of having been a
Partner in that Crime. So much for what concerns the Publick Moneys. As
for the Government of <hi>Gaul,</hi> it is true you did not give it to <hi>Anthony;</hi> but he
obtained it by Decree of the People in the presence of <hi>Cicero,</hi> as others obtained
other Provinces, and as <hi>Caesar</hi> himself obtained the same. It is ordered by the
same Decree, that if <hi>Decimus</hi> refuse to part with <hi>Gaul, Anthony</hi> may have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to constrain him by force; and to employ to that end the Army designed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Thracians, provided they made no attempt on <hi>Macedon.</hi> But <hi>Cicero</hi>
accounts not <hi>Decimus</hi> an Enemy, who is in Arms against the Ordinance of the
People; and yet would have <hi>Anthony</hi> be so, whom the People ordered to make
this War. So that blaming the Decree, he blames the Authors; but he ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to have disswaded them, than now revile them having given his consent
to it; he ought rather to have prevented the giving that Government to <hi>Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
                              <pb n="144" facs="tcp:65196:210"/>
whom the People had chased hence as a Murderer, than deprive <hi>Anthony</hi>
whom they had gratified. In summ, it is some imprudence to oppose the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the People in such a perillous time, without remembring that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Commonwealth they were Iudges of these things, and declared Friends
of Enemies whom they thought worthy; for by the Ancient Laws the People were
the sole Arbiters of Peace and War. And there is no doubt but had they a Head,
they would reassume this Authority, and absolutely deprive us of it. But <hi>Anthony</hi>
has put to death his Soldiers; he has acted according to the Power given him by
your Commission: Nor did there ever General give account of such matters to any
Man; for the Legislators never thought it for the Commonwealth's Advantage,
that a General should own his Soldiers for Iudges of his Actions: Besides,
nothing is more dangerous in an Army than Soldiers Contempt of their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
which has proved the destruction of many in the midst of Victory. Besides,
none of the Kindred of the decimated either have or do yet complain, and yet <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>
accuses him of Man-slaughter; and not content with the usual Punishment
of that Crime, treats him as a publick Enemy: Yet constantly affirms he has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
strange affronts from his Soldiers, in that two Legions whom you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to obey him, deserted him contrary to the Law of War; not to yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to you, but to <hi>Caesar.</hi> Notwithstanding all which, <hi>Cicero</hi> thinks their
Action good, and yesterday advised they might be rewarded at the Expence of the
Publick. God grant the Example may not one day prove dreadful: but however
it be, <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Heat and Animosity has carried him to a manifest Contradiction;
for he at once accuses <hi>Anthony</hi> of aspiring to the Tyranny, and of ill treating his
Soldiers: And certain it is, that those who pretend to usurp the Sovereign Power,
instead of ill treating Military Men, do all they can to gain their favour.
However, since he has had the confidence to impose this Calumny upon <hi>Anthony,</hi>
that following <hi>Caesar</hi>'s steps, he aimed at the Tyranny, let us examine all his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
particularly. Has he put any one to death without due Process, as Tyrants
use to do; he, who is himself in danger of being condemned without being heard?
Has he chased out of the City, or calumniously accused any Person before you?
And is there any appearance he that has done no private Wrong, should attempt
Publick? But pray <hi>Cicero,</hi> when was this done? Was it when he published
the Indempnity; or when he proposed the recalling the Son of your <hi>Pompey,</hi> and
making good to him his Father's Estate out of the Publick Moneys? or when he
caused to be arrested and put to death the false <hi>Marius,</hi> who troubled our Peace;
for which he was praised by all the Senate? (and, my Lords of the Senate, this is
the only Action <hi>Cicero</hi> durst not blame, because you applauded it.) Or, in fine,
was it when he passed that Decree, by which it is prohibited to make Dictators?
For this is the Summ of all his Management of Publick Affairs during the two
Months which after <hi>Caesar</hi>'s death he stayed in the City; during which the People
sometimes sought for the Murderers to put them to death, and you your selves
were often in fear and trouble of what might arrive; had he then been an ill Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,
could he ever expect a Conjuncture more favourable to his Designs? But
he never abused that Power and Charge of the Consulship: How so? Has not he
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> alone governed the Commonwealth, <hi>Dolobella</hi> being gone for <hi>Syria?</hi> Kept he
not armed Men about him for his security, which you your selves appointed?
Kept he not a Guard by Night in the City, even about his own House; which yet
was only done to warrant him from the Ambushes of his Enemies? Had he not a
fair apportunity upon the death of <hi>Caesar</hi> his Friend, his Benefactor, beloved by
all the People? And did there not one yet fairer present it self when he entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Guards to defend his life against those Murderers that attempted his, though
he never put to death or banished one of them; yet still he pardoned them so far
as in civility he could, nor ever hindred the giving of them Governments. These
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65196:210"/>
(Conscript Fathers) are the great Crimes, the manifest Crimes wherewith <hi>Cicero</hi>
accuses him. Nor is he content to make <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Actions only pass for Crimes.
He divines, and says, he had designed to bring his Army into the City, but that
he was afraid of <hi>Caesar,</hi> who had already with another Army possessed it. How
comes he then who had only designed it to be an Enemy to his Country, whilst he
that had really done it, and does in a manner still hold us besieged, is none? Or
why did not he come if he had designed it, unless being at the Head of thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
well disciplined Men, he were afraid of three thousand disordered an disar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
which were then with <hi>Caesar;</hi> and who were only come to reconcile them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and left him as soon as they knew he would employ them in a War? Or if
he durst not come with thirty thousand Men, how happened he to come afterwards
accompanied only with a thousand; With whom, when he went from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voli,</hi>
how many of us did attend him? How many swore Fidelity to him without
being required? And what Applause did <hi>Cicero</hi> himself give him? In short,
had he designed any thing against his Country, why left he with us those Hostages
yet at this Palace Gate, his Mother, his Wife, and his Son; who are at present
weeping for fear, not of the Accusations brought against him, but of the power
of his Enemies? Thus much I thought convenient, to make you understand the
Innocence of <hi>Anthony,</hi> and the Inconstancy of <hi>Cicero:</hi> and have now nothing
more to say, but to exhort all good Men not to offend the People, nor do Injustice
to <hi>Anthony,</hi> for fear of such trouble as may ensue to the City, the Commonwealth
being yet so weakly established, that it is ready to relapse into its first disorders,
if not timely relieved. However, it is my opinion, that we secure to our selves
Forces for the Defence of the City before any Attempt be made upon us from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.
Then you may take order for such things as are necessary, and decree what
you judge convenient, when it shall be in your power to put those Decrees in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
But how is this to be done? You need only leave to <hi>Anthony</hi> the
Province given him by the People; and after having recalled <hi>Decimus</hi> with his
three Legions hither, send him to <hi>Maccdon,</hi> and keep his Army. And if those
two Legions revolted from <hi>Anthony,</hi> have submitted to us, as <hi>Cicero</hi> affirms,
let us withdraw them from <hi>Caesar,</hi> and order their Return to the City. Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
five Legions at our dispose, we may issue what Orders we think requisite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
courting the grace or favour of any Man. This I speak to those who listen to
me without envy or hatred. As for those who suffer themselves to be transported
by their Passions and particular Animosities, I exhort them not to give too rash
Iudgment against Great Men, and Commanders of great Armies, lest we force
them to make War upon us: Let them remember <hi>Marcus Coriolanus,</hi> or rather
what so lately happened to us in the Person of <hi>Caesar,</hi> who likewise commanded
an Army. He offered us reasonable Conditions; yet we by rashly declaring him
Enemy, forced him indeed to become his Country's Foe. Let them likewise consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the interest of the People; who having been so lately enraged against <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
Murderers, may well think themselves despised when we give those their Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and praising <hi>Decimus,</hi> who would not submit to their Decree, declare <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
Enemy, because he from them required the Government of <hi>Gaul.</hi> In
short, I exhort all honest minded Men to reduce others to reason, and do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
the Consuls and Tribunes to appear more affectionate in providing against
those Evils wherewith the Commonwealth is threatned.</p>

               <p>Thus spake <hi>Piso</hi> for <hi>Anthony;</hi> and doubtless, his reproaching of <hi>Cicero</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/>
and the terror he imprinted in Men's minds were the cause he was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
Enemy. However, he could not prevail with them to leave him
the Government of <hi>Gaul,</hi> for the Kindred and Friends of the Conspirators
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65196:211"/>
prevented it. They feared left <hi>Anthony</hi> being at Peace, might reconcile
himself with <hi>Caesar,</hi> to revenge the death of his Father; and therefore did
all they could to foment their Division. It was therefore decreed to offer
him <hi>Macedon</hi> instead of <hi>Gaul;</hi> and as for the other Orders of the Senate,
the Fathers either over-reached or designing it, gave Commission to <hi>Cicero</hi>
to put them in writing, and send them to him. He drew them up after his
own fancy in these Terms: That <hi>Anthony</hi> should forthwith raise his Siege
before <hi>Modena,</hi> foregoing <hi>Gaul</hi> to <hi>Decimus,</hi> at a limited day repass the
<hi>Rubicon,</hi> which divides <hi>Gaul</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> and submit himself to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Senate. <hi>Cicero</hi> sent these Commands in this spiteful manner to
<hi>Anthony,</hi> contrary to the Senate's intention: Yet did he it not out of any
particular hate, but seemed dictated by Fortune, which had determined to
change the Face of the Republick, and to ruin <hi>Cicero.</hi> And this happened
at the same time that the Remains of <hi>Trebonius</hi> Body were brought to the
City; and that the Senate understanding how infamously he had been trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
forthwith declared <hi>Dolobella</hi> Enemy to his Country. The Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
sent to <hi>Anthony,</hi> ashamed to have brought him so insolent a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
delivered it into his hands without saying a word. At sight of it
he fell into a rage, and uttered many violent expressions against the Senate,
but especially aginst <hi>Cicero:</hi> That it amazed him that <hi>Caesar,</hi> who had done
such mighty Services for the Roman Empire, should be esteemed a Tyrant
and a King; and that Men should not have the same opinion of <hi>Cicero,</hi> who
having been made Prisoner of War by <hi>Caesar,</hi> and by him released without
any dammage or affront, preferred now his Murderers before his Friends.
He who hated <hi>Decimus</hi> whilst he was <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Friend; now he is become his
Murderer, favours the same <hi>Decimus</hi> who had received the Government of
<hi>Gaul</hi> from the same <hi>Caesar,</hi> and declares him Enemy who held it of the
People.</p>

                  <hi>Anthony</hi> having vented many such passionate things, wrote in Answer to
the Senate, that he submitted to their Authority for the Affection he bore
his Country: But as for <hi>Cicero,</hi> who had himself composed the Order sent
him, he answered him in these Terms: <hi>The People having by their Decree
given me the Government of</hi> Gaul, <hi>have likewise given me leave if</hi> Decimus
<hi>would not yield it up, to force him to it; and in his Person to punish all the rest of the
Murderers; and by his death purge the Senate of a Crime of which they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
because</hi> Cicero <hi>abets it.</hi> Upon report made to the Senate of what <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
had said and writ, they at that very instant not only declared him Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65196:211"/>
but his Army likewise, if they immediately left him not: And to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
Brutus</hi> they gave <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Illyria,</hi> with the Forces yet remaining
in those Provinces, till such time as the Commonwealth were setled. He
had already a particular Army, besides some Forces he had received from
<hi>Apuleius:</hi> He had likewise some Shipping, as well Galleys as Vessels of
Burthen; about sixteen thousand Talents of Silver, and a great quantity of
Arms found at <hi>Demetriade,</hi> where <hi>Caesar</hi> had long before layed up his Stores:
of which the Senate had by Decree given him the Disposition, with power
to employ what he judged necessary for the good of his Country. They
likewise conferred on <hi>Cassius</hi> the Government of <hi>Syria,</hi> with Commission to
make War upon <hi>Dolobella,</hi> and Command to all the Provinces depending
on the Roman Empire, from the Ionian Sea to the East, to obey the Orders
of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius.</hi> Thus in a short time without much labour their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
grew prodigiously powerful. This News coming to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s ear strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perplexed him: He thought the Amnesty granted by the Fathers had
some colour of humanity and compassion to their Relations and Peers in
Dignity; that those lesser Governments given them were only for their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity:
And he observed that only to maintain <hi>Decimus</hi> in <hi>Gaul,</hi> they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Anthony</hi> of aspiring to the Tyranny, and by the same invention engaged
himself to take the contrary Party. But when he saw they had declared
<hi>Dolobella</hi> Enemy for destroying one of those who had slain his Father; that
they had given <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> absolute power in many great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
and several Armies, with vast Summs of Money, and power to raise
more among all they commanded beyond the Ionian Sea, he no longer
doubted but it was their design to ruin <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Party, and re-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stablish that
of <hi>Pompey.</hi> He likewise now plainly perceived, that by their Cunning
they had made the Young Man of him; that they had given him a Statue,
with the Right of Precedency, and Quality of a Pro-Pretor, but that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they had stripped him of his Army; for where the Consuls command
together, the Pretor is nothing. In short, that having only given Rewards
to the Legions that deserted <hi>Anthony,</hi> it was a scorn of the rest of his Army;
and in the conclusion the War must needs turn to his dishonour, the Senate
only serving their own ends upon him till they were rid of <hi>Anthony.</hi> Upon
these thoughts which he discovered to none, he sacrificed as it is usual to
do upon the Entrance into any Charge; and that done, spoke thus to his
Army. <hi>I believe (Fellow Soldiers) that it is from you I hold that Office which
I this day receive, and as the Effects of your former Offer; for the Senate had not
given it me but that you desired it: Wherefore know, that to you I owe the whole
Obligation, and will testifie it abundantly if the Gods favour my designs.</hi> These
obliging words he spoke to gain the Hearts of the Soldiery. As for the
Consuls, <hi>Pansa</hi> went to raise Forces in some Corners of <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Hirtius</hi>
came to <hi>Caesar</hi> to make Division of their Forces. He had received private
Orders from the Senate to demand for his Portion those two Legions that
had deserted <hi>Anthony,</hi> knowing them to be the most considerable part of
the Army; which <hi>Caesar</hi> yielding to, after the Division made they went to
take up their Winter Quarters together. Towards the end of Winter <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus</hi>
being sorely oppressed with Famine, <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> marched sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
to <hi>Modena,</hi> to raise the Siege; but finding <hi>Anthony</hi> too well intren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
they durst not attempt forcing the Lines till <hi>Pansa</hi> were come up to
them. There happened mean while some Horse-Skirmishes, in which <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi>
though much stronger in Cavalry, got not much advantage by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the many Brooks that crossed the Country. Affairs being in this
posture at <hi>Modena, Cicero,</hi> because of the Consul's absence, strove to gain
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65196:212"/>
the people of the City by frequent Assemblies, making provision of Arms,
which the Artificers furnished gratis, and raising Monies, in the levying
which, he made <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Friends pay excessive Contributions; yet they
payed them without grumbling, for fear of exposing themselves to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
till such time as <hi>Pub. Ventidius,</hi> who had been an Officer under
<hi>Caesar,</hi> and was now <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Friend, no longer able to endure the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
went to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Colonies, where he was known, and raised two
Legions for <hi>Anthony,</hi> with which he marched towards the City, design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to seise upon <hi>Cicero.</hi> He put all into such a fright, that many sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their Wives and Children, as if they had been in utter despair, and
<hi>Cicero</hi> himself retired; which <hi>Ventidius</hi> having notice of, advanced towards
<hi>Modena</hi> to joyn with <hi>Anthony,</hi> but his way being cut off by <hi>Hirtius</hi> and
<hi>Caesar,</hi> he turned into the Country of<note n="*" place="margin">Marches of <hi>Ancona.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Picenum,</hi> where he raised another
Legion, waiting to see which way Affairs would go.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> Now <hi>Pansa</hi> drawing nigh to <hi>Modena, Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> sent <hi>Carsuleius</hi>
to meet him with <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Regiment of Guards, and the Legions of <hi>Mars,</hi> to
secure his passage through the Straits. <hi>Anthony</hi> had forbore to seise on
them, lest thereby he might put a stop to his great design, which was to
come to a Battel; wherefore not expecting any great effects from his Horse
in a Marshy Plain full of Ditches; as soon as he had notice of <hi>Carsuleiu</hi>'s
March, he placed two of his best Legions in ambush in the Marishes, on
each side of a narrow Causway, over which the Enemies were to pass,
<hi>Carsuleius</hi> having crossed the Straits by night, and in the Morning early the
Legion of <hi>Mars</hi> with five Cohorts being entred upon the Causway, on
which there was not a Man stirring, looking upon the Marishes on both sides
of them, they perceived the Bushes to wag, which gave them some su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion,
and soon after the brightness of the Shields and Helmets dazling
their eyes, they forthwith beheld <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Regiment of Guards coming to
charge them. The Legionary Soldiers perceiving themselves surrounded,
so that they could not make their retreat, obliged the new Soldiers to stand
Spectators of the Fight, without engaging, lest their want of experience
should breed disorder in the Bustle; and to <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Guards they opposed
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s, for themselves they divided into two Bodies, one commanded by
<hi>Pansa,</hi> the other by <hi>Carsuleius,</hi> and thus parted, went each into his side of
the Marish: so that in the two Marishes were fought two Battels, so near,
that nothing but the Causway hindred the one from seeing what the other
did, besides the third which was fought by the Guards on the Causway it
self. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Soldiers burnt with a desire of revenging themselves on the
Legions as Traytors and Runaways; and the Martials were no less eager to
have satisfaction for the injury they had done them in suffering their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
to be put to death at <hi>Brundusium,</hi> and knowing well that in them
consisted the principal force of both Armies, they hoped by this one Fight
to put an end to the War. The one Party were incited by the shame it
would prove to them, being two Legions, to be worsted by one; and the
other spurred on by the hopes of the Glory they should obtain, if, being
but one Legion, they defeated two. Thus pressed forward by mutual hate,
and considering more their own Honour than their Generals Interest, they
fought for themselves: and being all old Soldiers they began not the Fight
with a shout to frighten their Enemy, nor in the heat of the Fight did any
let drop a word, whether he fell or overcame, and not having by reason of
the Ditches in the Marish any room either to wheel or gain ground, they
kept firm footing without making any retreat, so that griping one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65196:212"/>
like Wrestlers, they struck not a blow but did it's execution, the
ground was covered with wounded and dying persons, not crying out, or
groaning for grief of their wounds, but sighing that they could do no more:
as soon as one fell, another supplyed his place: there was no need of advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
or encouraging them, for by reason of their long experience every
man was his own Captain; and when they found themselves quite tired like
Wrestlers in the Gymnick Games they stood staring on each other to gain a
little Breath, and then fell on afresh, to the great astonishment of the young
Soldiers, to see them do such brave things, and with so much stedfastness
keep their Ranks, in so profound a silence. At length having done on all
parts Acts more than humane, <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Guards were all cut in pieces, as for
the Legion of <hi>Mars,</hi> that part commanded by <hi>Carsuleius,</hi> gave some ground
to the Legion that opposed them, yet not with dishonour, but by little and
little, making a fair retreat. Those who fought under <hi>Pansa</hi> were in like
manner oppressed by their Opponents, yet so as they couragiously defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves, till such time as the Consul receiving a wound with a Pile in
the Thigh, was carried off the Field to <hi>Bolonia.</hi> Then they began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
by little and little, and after that somewhat faster, almost flying out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right;
which as soon as the young Soldiers observed, they took their
flight in disorder towards an Entrenchment which the Quaestor <hi>Torquatus</hi>
had caused to be raised to serve in case of necessity. Here whilst the rest
were yet fighting, these young Soldiers shut up themselves in a strange
fright and confusion, though they were Italians as well as the Martialists;
so much does Exercise and Discipline more than Birth contribute to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Men valiant. The Martialists would not enter the Intrenchment for
fear of blasting their Glory, but went and planted themselves at some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
thence, where, wearied as they were, they stood expecting a fresh
Charge, resolved to defend themselves to the last gasp; whereupon <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
judging it would be too hard a task to vanquish them, turned upon
the new raised Forces, of whom he made a horrible Slaughter. <hi>Hirtius,</hi>
who was in the Confines of <hi>Modena,</hi> about sixty Furlongs from the place
where this Battel was fought, hearing the news, made all the speed he
could thither with the other revolted Legion, and as towards Evening
<hi>Anthony</hi>'s Men were returning singing for the Victory, he surprised them
in disorder, with his Legion fresh, and in a posture of fighting; they drew
into the best order of Battel they could, and again acted wonders, but at
length quite tired they gave ground, yet the greatest part of them were left
upon the place. <hi>Hirtius</hi> would not pursue the others, for fear of engaging
himself in the Marishes, besides, night came on, so he caused the Retreat
to be sounded. The whole Marish was covered with Arms, dead, dying
and wounded Men, and some that were fallen among the rest only out of
pure weariness, wherefore <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Cavalry spent the night in gathering
up the Wracks of their Party, causing some to mount on their led Horses,
others to get up behind them, and perswading others to take hold of their
Horse tail to help them in marching, that they might the sooner get off.
And <hi>Anthony</hi> being after so brave a Fight defeated by <hi>Hirtius,</hi> went and
lodged at a Village near the Field of Battel, called the Market of the Gauls,
whore there was no Intrenchment: on either side near half the Army was
lost, with all <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Regiment of Guards. <hi>Hirtius</hi> lost few, and on the
morrow they all retired into their Camps before <hi>Modena. Anthony</hi> after
this loss resolved not to fight, though the Enemy should provoke him, but
to weary them with frequent Skirmishes, till such time as <hi>Decimus</hi> oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with Famine should be constrained to yield. <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> on the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65196:213"/>
contrary were the more eager to engage, and because they could not draw
<hi>Anthony</hi> to a Battel, they raised their Camp to go on the other side of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena,</hi>
where the Trenches were weaker by reason of the situation of the
place, resolving to force the Lines, and so gain an entrance into the City.
<hi>Anthony</hi> sent forth his Horse only, against which likewise they sent only
theirs, and held on the March with the rest of the Army: insomuch that
<hi>Anthony</hi> fearing to lose <hi>Modena,</hi> drew out against them two Legions whom
they made a halt for, and so had a Battel as they desired. Thereupon <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
sent for his other Forces, but by reason they expected not this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm,
and were quartered at some distance from the place of Battel, they
could not come so suddenly but that the Enemy had first gained a Victory.
<hi>Hirtius</hi> in person entred <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Camp, and bravely fighting before the
Generals Tent, was slain, <hi>Caesar</hi> coming in brought off his Body, and made
himself Master of the Camp; but being soon beat out again by <hi>Anthony,</hi>
they each stood all night in Arms. <hi>Anthony</hi> having now again received this
Defeat, held at the same time a Council of his Friends, who were of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
that he should continue the Siege, without fighting, the loss being
almost equal, <hi>Hirtius</hi> being slain, and <hi>Pansa</hi> being wounded, himself the
stronger in Horse, and <hi>Modena</hi> in such want of all things, that it could
not long subsist without surrendring; and surely this counsel he ought to
have followed, but Fate hindred it. He was fearful lest <hi>Caesar</hi> should throw
himself into the City, as he had attempted to do the day before; or else ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
conveniency for all Engines thereabout, should besiege himself, and so
make his Horse useless. <hi>Then,</hi> said he, Lepidus <hi>and</hi> Plancus <hi>will despise
me, as a man lost beyond repair; but if I raise my Siege,</hi> Ventidius <hi>will forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
bring us three Legions from the Country of</hi> Picenum, <hi>and</hi> Lepidus <hi>and</hi>
Plancus <hi>will come joyn with us numerous Forces.</hi> And in short, after having
thus spoken, this Man, hitherto fearless in all dangers, presently departs
from before <hi>Modena,</hi> and takes his March towards the <hi>Alpes.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> The Siege being raised, <hi>Decimus</hi> began to fear <hi>Caesar,</hi> for the Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no longer commanded by the Consuls, he thought him his Enemy,
wherefore before it was day he caused to break down the Bridge, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatched
some to <hi>Caesar,</hi> to acknowledge the obligation he had to him for
his deliverance, and to intreat him to come on the other side the River,
where in the presence of all the Inhabitants, he would convince him that
he was engaged in the Conspiracy more by misfortune than by fault. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
having hearkened to those who brought this message, answered in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
<hi>That he desired him not to own any obligation to him; for he came not to
serve him, but to make War upon</hi> Anthony <hi>the Enemy of his Country: that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
forbad his seeing or speaking to him; however, he was safe so long as he
pleased them who commanded at</hi> Rome. This answer being brought to <hi>Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
he went to the River side; and after having called <hi>Caesar</hi> by his name,
he read with a loud voice the Decree of the Senate which gave him the
Government of <hi>Gaul,</hi> forbidding him to pass the River, or enter into his
Province without the Consuls, nor so much as to pursue <hi>Anthony</hi> any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for that himself was strong enough to defeat him. Though <hi>Caesar</hi>
saw well that <hi>Decimus</hi> durst not have talked to boldly to him, had he not
been inspired by the Senate, since that he could with one sole command
of his reduce him under his power, which yet he would not do, but going
to <hi>Bolonia</hi> where <hi>Pansa</hi> was, he wrote to the Senate how all things passed,
as <hi>Pansa</hi> also particularly did. <hi>Cicero</hi> read <hi>Pansa</hi>'s Letters in a full Assembly
of the People; and those from <hi>Caesar</hi> in the Senate only, where he caused
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:65196:213"/>
to be ordained fifty days Feast for <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Defeat, though so many were
never ordained in any War, no not for any Victory gained from the
Gauls. He farther advised, that since <hi>Pansa</hi> was thought irrecoverable;
though he were yet living, they should give <hi>Decimus</hi> command of the
Consul's Army, with Commission himself alone to prosecute the War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Anthony;</hi> and that publick Prayers should be made for the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Arms, so much was <hi>Cicero</hi> transported against <hi>Anthony;</hi> besides
which they confirmed the gift of five thousand Drams a Head, promised to
the Legions that had quitted <hi>Anthony,</hi> payable out of the Moneys of the
Treasury, after the Victory, (as if it had been already gained) and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
them hereafter upon Holy-days to wear Crowns of Olive-branches.
In this Decree not so much as mention was made of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s name, so much
they already contemned him, out of a belief they had <hi>Anthony</hi> could never
make Head again, having to this purpose writ to <hi>Lepidus, Plancus</hi> and <hi>Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
who were at no great distance to complete his ruine. Whilst those
things passed at <hi>Rome, Pansa</hi> ready to die of his wound at <hi>Bolonia,</hi> calling
for <hi>Caesar,</hi> spoke to him in this manner:</p>

                           <p>I Loved your Father as my self, but after his death could not possibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
him, nor oppose my self to the judgment of the most, to whose authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
you have likewise prudently submitted your self, though you had an Army.
As at first they feared nothing more than you and <hi>Anthony,</hi> who had so great
an affection to your Father, so they were well satisfied with your Division,
hoping you would destroy one the other; and when they saw you Master of an
Army, they flattered you as a young Man, with specious Honours, which had
nothing in them but shew; but after they had examples of your Gallantry and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
by the refusal of those Honours offered you by your Army, they were start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and gave you a power equal to us, that they might by this means draw out
of your disposal two excellent Legions, out of hopes that one of you being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated,
the other which remained would not be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Party being ruined, <hi>Pompey</hi>'s might be re-established. This was the substance
of their thoughts. As for <hi>Hirtius</hi> and my self we had followed their order till
we could have abated the pride of <hi>Anthony;</hi> but after having overcome him,
designed to reconcile him with you, that we might pay to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s memory this
testimony of our Friendship and Acknowledgments, by acting what might be
most advantageous to his Party. It was not convenient till now to impart this
design to you; but now since <hi>Anthony</hi> is defeated, <hi>Hirtius</hi> dead, and I a dying,
I thought at time to discover it to you. I demand not that after my death you
should think your self obliged to me; but since your Actions make it known that
you are born under fortunate Stars, I tell it you, that you may bethink your self
what you have to do, and that you may know what <hi>Hirtius</hi> and I designed to do
for you, and what we have been constrained to do against you. It is therefore
just to restore to you that Army you gave up to us; and I now restore it to you.
As for the new raised Forces, if you can gain them to serve you, I will give
them to you: but if either the Soldiers are too fearful of the Senate, because
their Officers have in charge to observe us; or that you think you either may be
blamed, or stand in no need of them, <hi>Torquatus</hi> our Treasurer shall take them
in charge.</p>

After having said these words, and delivered over the new Forces to
the Treasurer or Quaestor, he died. The Quaestor by the Senates order
delivered them over to <hi>Decimus, Caesar</hi> solemnized magnificent Funerals
for <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Pansa,</hi> and sent their Bodies with pomp to <hi>Rome</hi> to be
buried.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/> At the same time that this was done in <hi>Italy,</hi> things passed thus in <hi>Syria</hi>
and <hi>Macedon, C. Caesar</hi> passing through <hi>Syria,</hi> and having already in his
thoughts the War against <hi>Parthia,</hi> had left in this Province a Legion which
he had given in charge to <hi>Cecilius Bassus,</hi> as Lieutenant to <hi>Sextus Iulius</hi> his
Kinsman, yet very young, and who going to take his pleasure in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
made his Soldiers accompany him against all decency and order,
<hi>Bassus</hi> having one day reproved him, he reviled him; and at another time
having sent for <hi>Bassus,</hi> because he came not so soon as he expected, he gave
order to bring him by force. This Command having raised a Tumult,
Blows ensued, and the Soldiers no longer able to endure <hi>Iulius</hi> his Insolence,
slew him with their Javelins. They at that very moment repented the act,
being afraid of <hi>Caesar;</hi> wherefore they immediately swore one to another,
that if pardon and security for their persons were denyed them, they would
defend each other to the death; they likewise forced <hi>Bassus</hi> to be of the
Conspiracy; and having raised another Legion, exercised them according
to the Roman Discipline. Thus write some concerning <hi>Bassus.</hi> But <hi>Libo</hi>
saith, that having born Arms under <hi>Pompey,</hi> after his death he retired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Tyre,</hi> where he remained some time as a private Man, and where at last
by his Money gaining some Legionary Soldiers, he prevailed with them after
they had slain <hi>Sextus</hi> to chuse him for their Captain. However it were,
<hi>Sextus Murcus</hi> haing been sent by <hi>Caesar</hi> against them, was repulsed, till such
time as he called to his assistance <hi>Minutius Crispus</hi> with three Legions
brought by him out of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> where he commanded. These had now
blocked up those two Legions, when <hi>Cassius</hi> coming unexpectedly received
them forthwith into his Service; and at the same time those six Legions
that besieged them, voluntarily submitting to him, acknowledged him for
Proconsul; for, as we have said before, the Senate had ordained by Decree
that all the Soldiers of those Provinces should obey <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi>
some time before <hi>Dolobella</hi> had sent <hi>Allienus</hi> into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> from whence he
was leading back four Legions, the Remains of the Defeats of <hi>Pompey</hi> and
<hi>Crassus,</hi> or of those which remained in the Service of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> when <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
left <hi>Aegypt. Cassius</hi> surprising him in <hi>Palestine,</hi> forced him to take his
Party; for he durst not resist eight Legions with four; so that <hi>Cassius</hi>
beheld himself, beyond all imagination, Master of twelve Legions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
and forced <hi>Dolobella,</hi> who returning out of <hi>Asia</hi> with two Legions,
was received as a Friend into the City of <hi>Laodicea;</hi> news, which the Senate
received with joy. As for what concerned <hi>Macedon, Caius,</hi> Brother to
<hi>Anthony,</hi> disputed that Government against <hi>Brutus</hi> with one only Legion;
and because he was not equal in numbers to <hi>Brutus,</hi> he laid an ambush for
him, which <hi>Brutus</hi> escaping, laid another in his turn, wherein <hi>Caius</hi> fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with all his People, he did them no displeasure; but on the contrary,
commanded his Soldiers to salute them, and though they would neither
return nor accept the Salute, yet he let them go without any farther inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
After which, taking a turn with his Army by other ways, he surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them again among the Straits, where instead of falling on, he a second
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65196:214"/>
time saluted them: whereupon admiring this Man's goodness and clemency
to his Fellow Citizens, they returned the Salute, and joyned with him,
<hi>Caius</hi> likewise embraced his Party, and <hi>Brutus</hi> treated him with much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
till after being convicted of having several times solicited the Army
to revolt, he put him to death. Thus <hi>Brutus</hi> had raised his Forces to six
Legions, besides two that by praising the Macedonians he raised in <hi>Macedon,</hi>
whom he learn'd to exercise according to the Discipline of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</p>
               <p>Thus went Affairs in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Macedon.</hi> Mean while in <hi>Italy, Caesar</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVIII"/>
offended, that in prejudice of him the Command of the Army against
<hi>Anthony</hi> was given to <hi>Decimus,</hi> dissembling his discontent, demanded the
Honour of Triumph, and being disdainfully refused by the Senate, as a
thing disconsonant with his age, and fearing, that after <hi>Anthony</hi> were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
defeated, they would treat him more scornfully, he designed a
reconciliation with him, according to the advice given him by the dying
<hi>Pansa.</hi> To bring this about he treated favourably all the Prisoners he had
in his Army, as well Officers as Soldiers, received into his service such as
were willing to be entertained, and sent away the rest, that he might not
appear to have an irreconcileable hatred. After which encamping near
<hi>Ventidius, Anthony</hi>'s Friend, who had only three Legions, he was content
to fright him; but making no hostile attempt, gave him either free leave
to joyn with him, or go in safety to find out his General, on condition that
he would tell him from him, that he knew not what was good both for the
one and t'other, which <hi>Ventidius</hi> accepting, marched forward to find out
<hi>Anthony.</hi> Another of his Captains called <hi>Decius,</hi> who had been taken
Prisoner before <hi>Modena,</hi> remaining still with <hi>Caesar,</hi> who held him in good
esteem he was permitted to return to <hi>Anthony</hi> if he desired it, and the
Captain asking him what thoughts he had of <hi>Anthony;</hi> he made answer,
he had already given sufficient testimonies of them to persons capable to
judge of Affairs, and for others 'twas in vain to give any more. After ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done these things which might easily make appear his inclinations to
<hi>Anthony,</hi> he writ to <hi>Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Asinius,</hi> directly complaining against the
affronts he had received from the Senate, by what they had done in strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
against him the Murderers of his Father, that they for their parts
might have reason to fear, lest in favour of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Faction they should
one after another persecute them, as now they did <hi>Anthony,</hi> who through
imprudence and want of foresight was fallen into misfortune: wherefore
he counselled them to seem in appearance to submit to the Senate, but really
to unite themselves one to the other for their common security, whilst yet
it was in their power, and to reprove <hi>Anthony</hi> for the fault by him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in not doing it. In short, that they ought to imitate the Legionary
Soldiers, who disband not as soon as the War is done, for fear of exposing
themselves to the Ambushes of their Enemies, and had rather be all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
led to some Colony, than return every Man to his own Country. Mean
while<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sickness seised on the Army which had been shut up with <hi>Decimus</hi>
in <hi>Modena,</hi> the most part of the Soldiers glutting themselves too much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so long a Famine, surfeited, and the new raised Men for want of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
were not fit for service: yet <hi>Plancus</hi> being joyned to them with what
force he had, <hi>Decimus</hi> wrote to the Senate, that <hi>Anthony</hi> not well digesting
what he had already tasted of the War, hid himself, but that at length he
would fall into his hands. 'Tis incredible how <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Party were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65196:215"/>
at this news: they made loud outcryes that now their Country had
indeed recovered their Liberty, and every one offered Sacrifices, and ten
Commissioners were nominated to take account of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which was only a pretence to cancel all that <hi>Caesar</hi> had ordained; for
<hi>Anthony</hi> had done nothing, or very little of himself, acting always accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Memoirs. The Fathers knew it well enough, but having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in some occasion given judgment without any respect to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
they thought at this time absolutely to annul all that ever he had
done or decreed, to which end the ten Commissioners presently published
an Ordinance, by which all persons that had received any thing from <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,</hi>
were injoyned to bring it in, in writing, under pain of exemplary
punishment. At length some of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Party demanded the Consulate
for the rest of the year, in the places of <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Pansa.</hi> And <hi>Caesar</hi>
had a great desire to it, he solicited not the Senate about it, but wrote to
<hi>Cicero,</hi> praying him to endeavour that they might be Colleagues in the
Dignity, and that he would leave to him the Administration of all Affairs,
as being most capable, by reason of his long experience, and would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himself with the Quality, that he might with more Honour lay down
Arms, having before to that end demanded Triumph. <hi>Cicero</hi> who loved
Command, was tickled with this proposition. He therefore told the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that having understood they consulted an Accommodation between
the Governours of the Province, his advice was, that they should by some
good Office appease a Man they had offended, and who was at the Head of
a powerful Army, that for his part he thought it better, that before the age
allowed by the Laws, they should nominate him to a charge to be exercised
in the City, than behold him in the Field at the Head of an Army, capable
to revenge himself: nevertheless, that he might act nothing contrary to
the authority of the Senate, he exhorted them to give him for Colleague
some aged and prudent person to serve as a Guide to his youth. The whole
Senate laughed at <hi>Cicero</hi>'s ambition, but above all, the Kindred of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators
opposed him, out of the fear they had, lest if <hi>Caesar</hi> obtained the
Consulate, he should study revenge; insomuch that the Assembly was no
more summoned, because a lawful one could not be called for sundry
reasons.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/> Mean while <hi>Anthony</hi> having crossed the <hi>Alpes</hi> by consent of <hi>Culeo,</hi> who
guarded the passage by order of <hi>Lepidus,</hi> came and lodged his Army on a
River side by him, without fortifying his Camp; but as one Friend sits
down by another there several times their People went and came from
one to the other, <hi>Anthony</hi> put <hi>Lepidus</hi> in mind of their Friendship, of what
he had done for him, and advised to beware lest all those who had been of
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s Party were not oppressed one after another, and <hi>Lepidus</hi> excused him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon the Orders of the Senate, which commanded him to make War,
though it would trouble him to come to extremities with him. But <hi>Lepidus</hi> his
Soldiers, whether they had a respect for <hi>Anthony,</hi> or else perceived some Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations,
or otherwise took delight to see that unfortified Camp, mixed
with those of <hi>Anthony,</hi> at first privately, and at last publickly, as going to
see their Countrymen, and sometime Comrades: in vain did their Officers
forbid it. And to the end they might more easily converse together, they
made a Bridge of Boats over the River; and the tenth Legion which had
formerly been commanded by <hi>Anthony;</hi> carried him from <hi>Lepidus</hi> his
Camp all things necessary. <hi>Laterensis</hi> one of the most considerable Senators
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65196:215"/>
perceiving it, gave notice to <hi>Lepidus,</hi> and when he would believe nothing
of it, desired him to divide his Army, and send one part ot any place where
he might feign employment for them, and others elsewhere, thereby to try
the faith or perfidiousness of his Soldiers. Thereupon he drew his Forces
into three Bodies, and commanded them to depart by night to go and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy
the Quaestors, who were not far off. But they about the third Watch
arming themselves as for a March, seised on the Trenches, and went and
opened the Gates to <hi>Anthony.</hi> He run directly to the Generals Tent, led
by <hi>Lepidus</hi>'s Soldiers, crying out, that he should make peace, and pardon
his miserable Fellow Citizens. Upon the noise hereof he leaps out of Bed,
and quite unready runs to meet them, promising to do what they would
have him, and embracing <hi>Anthony,</hi> craved pardon for what he had been
forced to do. Nay, some say he fell on his Knees to <hi>Anthony:</hi> but that he
was so base and cowardly, all Authors do not affirm: and in my opinion it
seems scarce credible, for he had as yet committed no act of Hostility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Anthony,</hi> which might occasion him to be so fearful. Thus <hi>Anthony</hi>
became more powerful and more formidable to his Enemies than ever he
had been before; for besides the Forces brought from <hi>Modena,</hi> among
which he had exeellent Horse, <hi>Ventidius</hi> had by the way joyned with him
with other three Legions, and now <hi>Lepidus</hi> with seven more, furnished
with light armed Foot, Horse, and a considerable train, all which went in
<hi>Lepidus</hi>'s name; but indeed <hi>Anthony</hi> was Master of them. This news
having reached the City, wrought in a moment a wonderful change. Those
who despised him before now feared him, and they who feared before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
now to take heart, with scorn they tore down the Ordinances of the
Commissaries, fixed in the publick places, and prorogued to a farther
time the Assembly for election of Consuls. The Senate most heavily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
with fear, lest <hi>Caesar</hi> should make an Accommodation with <hi>Anthony,</hi>
deputed two of their Body, <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Pansa</hi> to <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> to assist
them in what they could, under pretence of overlooking the Estate of
<hi>Greece:</hi> of the three Legions <hi>Sextus</hi> had in <hi>Africa</hi> they sent for two over,
and gave the other to <hi>Cornificius,</hi> who commanded in a part of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and was firm to the Senates interests, though the Senate were jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of these Forces, which they knew well had served under <hi>Caesar:</hi> but
necessity forced the Fathers to this, as well as most shamefully to give <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
joynt Command with <hi>Decimus</hi> of the War against <hi>Anthony,</hi> because
they were afraid he should joyn with <hi>Anthony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Caesar</hi> did all he could to incense his Soldiers against the Senate, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XX"/>
well for the injuries himself had received, as because they were sent upon
a second Expedition, without being payed the five thousand Drams a Head,
due for the first; insomuch that upon his advice to send Deputies to <hi>Rome</hi>
to demand that Money, they gave Commission to their Centurions. The
Senate knew well he had set them on, and therefore said they would give
an answer by other Commissioners of their own. And indeed they sent
them with orders to address themselves to <hi>Anthony</hi>'s two Legions, without
speaking to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and to advise them not to place their hopes upon one
man alone, but rather rely on the power of the Senate, which was immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
and to march over to <hi>Decimus,</hi> where they should find the rest of
their Money; for to the end they might the more easily speak to them, they
had brought half the Money, and deputed ten Commissioners to distribute
it, without so much as naming <hi>Caesar</hi> for the Eleventh: but the Legions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65196:216"/>
to hear the Deputies, unless <hi>Caesar</hi> were present, they went away
without doing any thing. Hereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> thinking it no longer fit to delay,
or to declare his mind by others, assembled the Army to speak to them
himself, where after having related all the injustices of the Senate, he told
them that all was done tended only to the ruine of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Party one after
another, that they should beware of fighting for their Enemies, or suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves to be engaged in endless Wars, wherein they employed
them only, that they might perish in Fight, or be ruined by Seditions,
which was the reason why after they had all served together at <hi>Modena,</hi>
they offered reward only to two Legions, that they might raise a jealousoe
and division amongst them.</p>

Consulate for <hi>Caesar.</hi> The Senate objecting that he was not of age, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by Law, they answered (as they were prepared) that <hi>Corvinus</hi>
was formerly created Consul as young as he, and <hi>Scipio</hi> after him, who as
young as they were had both done signal service for their Country. They
alledged likewise the fresher examples of <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Dolobella;</hi> besides
that a Decree had already passed permitting the same <hi>Caesar</hi> to demand the
Consulate ten years before the appointed age. Whilst the Centurions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
offered these reasons, some of the Senators offended at the freedom
of their speech, interrupted them, by saying they talked too high for Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of their Quality, which being reported to the Army, so highly incensed
the Soldiers, that they desired to be led directly to the City, where them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
holding the Assembly they would make <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Son Consul, to whom
at the same instant they gave a thousand praises. <hi>Caesar</hi> seeing them thus
disposed, presently drawing together his Army, raises the Camp with
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65196:216"/>
eight Legions, good Horse, and all other things necessary, passes the <hi>Rubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con</hi>
that divides <hi>Gaul</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> from whence formerly his Father had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
the Civil War. There he divides his Army into two Bodies, leaving
one in the Rear to follow him at leisure, and at the Head of the other who
were all chosen Men, marching by great journies directly towards <hi>Rome,</hi>
that he might surprise his Enemies before they could be prepared. Having
advice by the way, that upon the same Road Commissioners sent by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
with the Soldiers Money were coming to meet him, he was jealous
lest any of his Men might be tempted by this reward, wherefore he private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sent Scouts towards them, who so terrified them, that away they fled
with their Money. The news of his approach filled all the City with Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult
and Terrour; some run through the Streets in disorder, others car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away their Wives, Children, and choicest Goods into the Country, or
to the strongest places of the City. For it not being certainly known if he
only demanded the Consulate, upon the rumour that he came in a hostile
manner at the Head of an angry Army, every thing appeared dreadful to
them. Especially in the Senate the consternation was great, because they
had not at present any Army to defend them. Some (as it happens ever
in like Allarms) accused others, either that they had injuriously taken
from him the Legions they had given him to make War upon <hi>Anthony,</hi> or
that they had denyed him the Triumph due to him, or that out of envy to
him, when they sent the ten Commissioners to pay the Army, they had
not so much as named him for the eleventh, or that they had not payed the
Money promised the Soldiers, either not in time, or at least not in full, and
thereby had given them cause to revolt. But that which they most of all
blamed, was the disobliging <hi>Caesar</hi> in an ill Conjuncture, <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi>
being at a great distance, and as yet but meanly prepared, and <hi>Anthony</hi>
and <hi>Lepidus</hi> both at hand, and ready to fall upon the City, who, if they
entertained but the thoughts of making an Accommodation with <hi>Caesar,</hi>
might complete its ruine. <hi>Cicero</hi> himself, who appeared most officious in
all other matters, now shewed not his Head: insomuch that in a moment
the face of all things was so utterly changed, that instead of two thousand
five hundred Drams offered to every Soldier, it was ordered by Decree of
the Senate, that five thousand should be payed them, not for two Legions
only, but for eight, of which <hi>Caesar</hi> himself should have the distribution,
and the ten Commissioners. As for <hi>Caesar,</hi> though he were absent, they
gave him the Consulate, and dispatched away Commissioners post to carry
him the news of it.</p>
               <p>But scarcely were they got out of the City when the Senate repented,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXI"/>
most of them began to cry out, that it was a shame they should so coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suffer themselves to be trod under foot, and suffer the setting up of a
new Tyranny without shedding of Blood, or should accustom pretenders
to the Consulate to demand it with Arms in their hands, and Soldiers to
command their Country. That therefore they ought presently to arm,
and oppose the authority of the Laws to those who offered them violence;
and if they repented them not (as it was not credible they would) endure
a Siege, expecting the coming of <hi>Plancus</hi> and <hi>Decimus</hi> to relieve the City,
and in the mean time fight to the last gasp, rather than submit to servitude
without defending themselves. They alledged hereupon example of things
which their Predecessors had undertaken, executed, and suffered, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Liberty; and when they saw the two Legions they had sent for
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65196:217"/>
out of <hi>Africa</hi> arrive at the Port that very day, they thought the Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
themselves in their defence; insomuch that they confirmed themselves
in their repentance, and <hi>Cicero</hi> beginning to appear, the Decree was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
changed. They made a Roll of all the youth capable to bear Arms,
to joyn with the two Legions newly come from <hi>Africa,</hi> a thousand Horse,
and another Legion which <hi>Pansa</hi> had left them, they gave Quarters to all
these Troops, one part guarded the <hi>Ianiculum</hi> with the Riches there stored
up, another the Bridge over <hi>Tiber,</hi> under the Command of the Pretors of
the City, and others kept within the Port Boats and Vessels laden with
Money, ready, if necessity required, to flie towards the River, and gain
the Sea, making these preparations with a countenance of defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they hoped <hi>Caesar</hi> might take his turn to be in fear, or that they
should perswade him to come, and demand the Consulate without bringing
his Army, or that at last they should repulse him by force, and that the
question being the preservation of common liberty, all contrary Parties
might unite. But when after having made a long search both publickly and
privately for <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Mother and Sister, and not finding them, their fears
returned, beholding themselves robbed of such mighty Hostages, it being
unlikely that those of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Party would joyn with them in the common
defence, who had so well concealed his best Friends. Whilst <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>esar</hi> was
yet in conference with the Deputies, came other to tell him, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
had changed their resolution; so that the first returned loaden with
shame and confusion, and he with an Army incensed at these proceedings,
marched towards the City, troubled for his Mother and his Sister, and
fearful lest any mischief should befal them. He sent before some Horsemen
to assure the People, who trembled for fear; and to the great astonishment
of all the world came and encamped over against Mount <hi>Quirinal,</hi> whilst
none durst either oppose or hinder him. At his arrival likewise a sudden
change arose in the minds of Men, the Nobility went in throngs to do him
reverence, and the People ran by whole companies to welcome the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
who for their parts committed no more disorders, than in time of
the profoundest peace. On the morrow leaving his Army in that place,
he set forward towards <hi>Rome</hi> with an indifferent Train, which increased in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
as he went, by the concourse of multitudes of persons, who came
from all parts to complement him, and to pay him all the testimonies of
respect and submission possible. His Mother and Sister who had taken
Sanctuary among the Vestals, received him with extreme joy in the
Temple of that Goddess; and the three Legions that were in the City,
without taking notice of their Officers, sent their Deputies, and submitted
themselves to him, and after them the Officers themselves made their
composition, and swore fidelity to them, save only <hi>Cornutus,</hi> who slew
himself. <hi>Cicero</hi> understanding how things went by the intermission of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s
Friends, had leave to see him, who made an Oration to him, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him that he demanded the Consulate, concerning which he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made a proposition to the Fathers, to all which he in Raillery an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>That he was the last of his Friends that came to see him.</hi> The night
following a rumour was raised, that the Legion of <hi>Mars,</hi> together with
the fourth were coming towards the City to seise it by suprise, which the
Pretors and Senate too easily believed: and though <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Army was all
at hand, they imagined that they alone with the principal Citizens could
for some time make resistance till other Forces from elsewhere might come
to their relief: so that very night they sent away <hi>Acilius Crassus</hi> to go and
raise Men in the Country of <hi>Picenum,</hi> and gave order to <hi>Apuleius</hi> one of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65196:217"/>
the Tribunes to go through the City, and declare this news to the People;
and at the same instant assembled themselves in the Palace, where <hi>Cicero</hi>
received them at the Gate; but when the report proved false, fled away
in his Litter out of the City: <hi>Caesar</hi> laughed at their weakness, and caused
his Army to advance into the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> yet offered no affront to
the Pretors, not so much as to <hi>Crassus,</hi> who was going to raise Men against
him, though brought to him disguised in the Habit of a Slave, but freely
pardoned all, that he might beget in the Citizens an opinion of his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.
In the mean time he caused to be brought to him all the publick
Treasure that was in the <hi>Ianiculum,</hi> or elsewhere, of which according to
Decree of the Senate passed before by the advice of <hi>Cicero,</hi> he distributed
to each Soldier two thousand five hundred Drams, promising to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
for the rest, and that done he went out of the City, expecting till
the day for election of Consuls.</p>
               <p>In conclusion, he was nominated to that Dignity, and with him (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his desire) <hi>Quintus Pedius,</hi> who had given him his part of the
Inheritance left by <hi>Caesar.</hi> He entred <hi>Rome</hi> as Consul, and offered the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
accustomary upon such occasions, during which there appeared o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the City twelve Vultures, in like manner, as it is said, there appeared
to <hi>Romulus</hi> when he founded it. After having performed these Sacrifices,
he declared himself Son of <hi>Caesar</hi> in the Assembly of the Tribes, that he
might confirm his Adoption by the People; for the People are divided into
Tribes in <hi>Rome,</hi> in the same manner as the Phratrians among the Greeks.
Now this formality observed in the Adoptions of those who have no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
gives them the same advantages and the same right that natural
Children have in respect to the Kindred and<note n="*" place="margin">The Patron and Son of the Patron was Heir to the Freed Man.</note> Freed Men of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
wherefore because <hi>Caesar</hi> besides the great Wealth he left, had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Freed Men very rich, I am of the mind, that the Son not content with
his first Adoption, thought the second necessary. He revoked likewise
the Decree by which <hi>Dolobella</hi> was declared Enemy, and permitted all
persons whatsoever to become parties against those who were guilty of
his Father's Murder. There presently appeared great numbers of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s
Friends, who formed their accusations not only against those who had
an immediate hand in the Action, but likewise against many who were
privy to the plot, but were not in <hi>Rome</hi> when it was executed, nor
were otherwise guilty, than in not discovering it. Having all been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
summoned to appear on the same day, they were condemned by
default, <hi>Caesar</hi> sitting in Judgment, and not one of the Judges arguing
for their Discharge, except one of the most considerable, to whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was said at present, but not long after he was proscribed with
many others. About the same time one of the Pretors of the City
named <hi>Quintus Gallius,</hi> Brother of <hi>Marcus Gallius,</hi> who was with <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
having obtained from <hi>Caesar</hi> the Government of <hi>Africa,</hi> and after
standing convict of an Attempt against the life of his Benefactor, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
from his Charge, by his Brethren in Office, the People plundered
his House, and the Senate condemned him to death. However, <hi>Caesar</hi>
commanded him to go and find out his Brother, and he embarquing
himself to that purpose, was never seen more. After these Exploits
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s whole thoughts were employed in reconciling himself with <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
because he certainly knew that <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> had twenty Legions,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65196:218"/>
so that standing in need of him, he went out of the City, and by
small Journies marched towards the Ionian Sea, that he might find
out how the Senate stood affected. For in the absence of <hi>Caesar, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
advised the Fathers to an Accommodation with <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus</hi>
before the Animosities that were between the Parties became ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable.
They saw well such an Accommodation was neither
for theirs, nor their Countries Advantage, and that by it <hi>Caesar</hi> only
aim'd at strengthening himself against <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Brutus:</hi> yet they
beheld themselves in a necessity to consent; wherefore they repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Decrees by which <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Lepidus</hi> with their Armies
had been declared Enemies, and sent them assurances of their good
will. <hi>Caesar</hi> wrote Letters of Congratulation to the Senate, and sent
to <hi>Anthony,</hi> that if he stood in need of his Arms against <hi>Decimus,</hi>
he was ready to serve him: and <hi>Anthony</hi> returned Answer, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
he made War against <hi>Decimus</hi> as a Traytor to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and against
<hi>Plancus</hi> as an Enemy to <hi>Anthony;</hi> and therefore if he pleased, he
would joyn Forces with him. After the mutual sending and recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Letters, as <hi>Anthony</hi> pursued <hi>Decimus, Asinius Pollio</hi> came and
joyned with him with two Legions, and by his intercession <hi>Plancus</hi>
reconciled with <hi>Anthony</hi> brought him three more; so that he became
mighty powerful. As for <hi>Decimus</hi> he still had ten Legions, four where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
composed of experienced Soldiers, were yet sick after the Famine
they had undergone in <hi>Modena,</hi> and six were newly levyed, neither
trained, nor inured to hardship; wherefore thinking it imprudence
to bring them to action, he resolved to retreat to <hi>Brutus</hi> in <hi>Macedon,</hi>
and took his March not by the Cisalpine <hi>Gaul,</hi> but by <hi>Ravenna</hi> or
<hi>Aquileia,</hi> and yet at last because <hi>Caesar</hi> was to come into those Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
he attempted a longer and more incommodious March by going
over the <hi>Rhine</hi> to cross a Country inhabited by Barbarians. The
difficulty of this unknown way at first sight so affrighted his new For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that they left him, and submitted to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and not long after
the four old Legions went over to <hi>Anthony,</hi> with all the rest of his
Forces, except only the French Horse designed for his Life Guard.
Reduced to this small number, he gave license to all that had yet a
mind to depart, making them some present of Money, and with three
hundred Horse only came to the Banks of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> but by reason of
the difficulty of passing the River, they by little and little forsook him,
except only ten, with whom, habited after the fashion of the Gauls,
and speaking their language, he began again to travel, and without
fetching so great a compass, took the Road to <hi>Aquileia,</hi> where he
thought he might pass unknown, because of his slender Train. In
the way being taken by Thieves, and bound, he asked them how they
called the Lord of that Country; and when he understood it was
<hi>Camillus,</hi> for whom he had done some services, he intreated them to
carry him before him. When <hi>Camillus</hi> saw him, he received him with
much civility before the People, sharply reproving those that brought
him bound, that through ignorance they had affronted so great a
Man, but in private he gave advice to <hi>Anthony,</hi> who had so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
of his fortune, that he would not see him. However, he sent
to <hi>Camillus</hi> for his Head, which after having viewed, he gave to some
of his People to be buried. Thus ended <hi>Decimus,</hi> who had been Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the Horse to <hi>Caesar,</hi> Governour of the Transalpine <hi>Gaul</hi> under
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65196:218"/>
him, designed by him for Consul the year following, and with it
provided of the Government of the Cisalpine <hi>Gaul.</hi> He was the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
that perished for murdering <hi>Caesar.</hi> And about the same time
<hi>Minutius Basilius,</hi> who was likewise of the Conspiracy, was slain by
his Slaves for making some of them Eunuchs by way of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

perished in their Governments; to wit, <hi>Trebonius</hi> in
<hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Decimus</hi> in <hi>Gaul;</hi> in this we shall set forth how
<hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> the principal Authors of the Conspiracy,
were punished. Men, that were Masters of all the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Macedon,</hi> who commanded mighty Armies both by Sea
and Land; having more than twenty Legions, great number of Shipping,
and abundance of Money. And this was done at a time when Proscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
were dreadful at <hi>Rome;</hi> and that as many proscribed Persons as could
be found were miserably put to death. So that the like had never been seen
or known among all the Tumults and Wars of the Grecians, nor yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
those of the Romans, if you except the time of <hi>Sylla,</hi> who was the first
proscribed his Enemies: for <hi>Marius</hi> only slew such as fell into his Hands;
whereas <hi>Sylla</hi> not only permitted any that would to slay those he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
but proposed Rewards to the Murderers, and decreed Punishments
against any durst give succour to a proscribed Person. But of all those
things we have discoursed in writing what passed in the time of <hi>Marius</hi> and
<hi>Sylla;</hi> let us proceed to our order of History.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> being reconciled to <hi>Anthony,</hi> it was determined to have a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
together. The place designed for it was near <hi>Modena,</hi> in a little flat
Island of the River <hi>Labinia:</hi> whither they came with each five Legions;
which taking their Stands on each side the River, the two Generals, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
only by three hundred Men each, advanced to the Bridges that went
over the Streams. <hi>Lepidus,</hi> who was before gone into the Island to see that
there were no Ambuscade, having made them the Signal by shewing his
Coat-Armor, they left all their Train at the Bridges; and advancing on to
the highest part of the Island, they three sat down; <hi>Caesar</hi> in the middle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of his Quality of Consul. After two whole Days Conference they
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:65196:220"/>
came to this Result: That <hi>Caesar</hi> should for the rest of the Year quit the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulate
to <hi>Ventidius:</hi> That to put a stop to the Civil Wars there should be
created a new Office, which <hi>Anthony, Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> should exercise
joyntly for five Years, with the same Power as the Consuls (for they would
not make use of the name of Dictator, perhaps because of the Law <hi>Anthony</hi>
had so lately made to abolish the Dictatorship.) That as soon as they had
taken Possession of this new Dignity, they should design for five Years the
Annual Officers of the City. That the Provinces should be parted among
them: <hi>Anthony</hi> should have all the <hi>Gauls,</hi> except only that confining upon
the Pyrenean Mountains, called Antient <hi>Gaul;</hi> which, together with
<hi>Spain,</hi> should remain to <hi>Lepidus;</hi> and that <hi>Caesar</hi> should take <hi>Africa,</hi> with
<hi>Sicily, Sardinia,</hi> and all the other adjacent Isles. In this Division of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire among themselves, they forbore sharing the other Provinces,
because <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> yet held them. They agreed therefore together,
that <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> should make War upon them: That <hi>Lepidus,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
Consul for the Year following, should remain in the City, that he
might provide them of all things necessary; and should govern <hi>Spain</hi> by
his Lieutenants: That of the ten Legions that composed his Army, he
should keep three for the Defence of the City, and give three to <hi>Caesar</hi> and
four to <hi>Anthony;</hi> by which means each of them would have twenty Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And that they might encourage the Soldiers, besides the Recompence
usually referred till after the Victory, and other Donatives; they assigned
them for Colonies eighteen of the best Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> as well for the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Buildings, as Fertility and Riches of the adjacent Soil, whose Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Fields they set out amongst them, as it is usual to divide a conquered
Country. The chief of these were <hi>Capua, Rhegium, Venosa, Beneventum,
Luceria, Rimini.</hi> Thus was the best part of <hi>Italy</hi> destined a Recompence to
the Soldiers. They resolved likewise that before all things else they would
rid themselves of their particular Enemies, lest they should be a hindrance
to their Designs when they were gone out of the City. These things being
all agreed to, and put in writing, <hi>Caesar</hi> as Consul, read them publickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all the Forces (except only that concerning the Proscriptions, which he
kept secret) who received them all with a general Acclamation; and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
both Armies saluted each other in token of Reconciliation.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Mean while many dreadful Prodigies appeared at <hi>Rome.</hi> All the Dogs
of the City howled like Wolves, which is accounted an unhappy Presage.
The Wolves, which do not usually come into Cities, came now into the
Great Place. An Ox spoke with a Man's voice. A Child spoke as soon as
it was born. The Statues of the Gods sweated, some Water, and some
Blood. The cries of Men, clattering of Arms, and running of Horses
were heard; yet not seen. Many frightful Signs appeared about the Sun.
It rained Stones. Thunder fell upon several Temples, and some of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
images of the Gods were stricken. Hereupon the Senate sent for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
out of <hi>Tuscany;</hi> the eldest of which told them, that the Royalty should
be re-established, and they all Slaves but only He: and therewith stopping
his Mouth, held his Breath so long, till he fell down dead in the place. This
Triumvirate then after their Agreement made, began to contrive among
themselves the Roll of the Proscribed; wherein they inserted all those
whose too great power they were jealous of, and all their particular Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
abandoning their own Friends and Relations to one another, so they
might by that means be revenged on those they hated. And this they did,
not only at present, but even afterwards; for they proscribed an infinite
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:65196:220"/>
number one after another, either out of some old Grudge, or some light<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or for being Friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to their Enemies, or Enemies to their Friends or
because they were rich. And indeed they stood in need of store of Money
for the War, <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> having received abundance from the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of <hi>Asia,</hi> besides what those Kings and Potentates furnished them with;
whereas these had none to receive, but only out of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> already
drained dry by Exactions and Wars. In so much, that to raise Money,
there was no Person to the most miserable of the People, without excepting
the very Women, who suffered not a thousand Violences from the Tax-Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers,
if they were but informed they had any thing. There were some
likewise proscribed for the beauty of their Houses or Gardens. In short, the
Roll of the Proscribed, with Confiscation of Goods, amounted to three
hundred Senators, and two thousand Roman Knights; among whom some
were Brethren and Uncles to the Triumvirs, and Officers that had served in
their Armies for having displeased the Generals or their Lieutenants. They
deferred the rest of the Proscription till such time as they came to the City;
and in the mean time resolved to begin the Execution by twelve (or as some
say) by seventeen of the Principal, among whom was <hi>Cicero.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
they sent some of their People, who forthwith slew four whom they
found either at their Tables or in the Streets. The others were sought for
in Temples and Houses; in so much, that all that Night there was a great
Tumult: People running up and down the City with such cryings and
howlings, as if the Enemy had been in the midst of them; for hearing of
some being taken, and not knowing of any Person yet proscribed, every
Man thought the next he met sought for him. So that in a general Despair
some disposed themselves to set fire, either to their own Houses, or the
Publick Buildings, that before they died they might do something worthy
of Memory: And they had done it if the Consul <hi>Pedius,</hi> running about to
all parts, had not exhorted them to be in good hopes, and to expect till
Day gave better knowledge of the Cause of the Disorder. Morning being
come, without staying for the Triumvirs Orders, he proscribed those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen
Men as the only Authors of Intestine Mischiefs, and the only Men
condemned; promising Security to all others, because he knew not what
had been agreed upon; and after dyed of a Distemper caused by the too
much labour undergone that Night. Three days following arrived one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
another, <hi>Caesar, Anthony</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> each with his Regiment of Guards
and one Legion; and immediately the City was filled with armed Men,
and Courts of Guards placed in the most convenient Stations. Then were
the People assembled, and <hi>Publius Titius</hi> the Tribune proposed the Law for
Creation of the Triumvirate; to which he nominated <hi>Lepidus, Anthony</hi>
and <hi>Caesar</hi> to govern the Commonwealth for five Years, with the same
Power the Consuls had (this is what the Greeks call <hi>Harmostates,</hi> and the
Lacedemonians Reformers) and without giving the People time to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
or to appoint a Day for holding another Assembly, the Law was at
that instant ratified. The Night following besides the seventeen before
there were found one hundred and thirty more, whose Names were fixed
up in divers places of the City; soon after one hundred and fifty others
were added; and at last the Roll was dayly augmented with names of new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
condemned People, or of those who had been slain by mistake, that they
might not be thought to be killed without Cause. Those likewise who kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
any proscribed Persons were commanded to bring their Heads to the
Triumvirs; and to this purpose Rewards were decreed them, to the Free
Men Money, and to Slaves Freedom and Money. Nothing was barred
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:65196:221"/>
against those that sought for them, because it was forbid under the like
pain, either to receive them, or conceal them, or deny entrance into the
House to any that sought after them, with a like Reward to any gave In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of all these things.</p>
               <p>The Ordinance for Proscription was conceived in these Terms.</p>

Pardon had not become Enemies to their Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
so far as to attempt against their Lives, and that
they had not murdered <hi>Caesar;</hi> who after having reduced
them under his Power, saved them, honoured them with
his Friendship, and loaded them with Honours, Favours
and Dignities; we had not been forced to come to Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
to revenge our selves of the Injuries they have
done us, in declaring us Enemies to our Country. But
now that after so many Ambushes laid for us, and the Murder committed on the
Person of <hi>Caesar,</hi> we are bound to believe that their Malice cannot be overcome
by fair means, we have chose rather to prevent our Enemies, than to wait till
they destroy us. Wherefore, whoever shall consider in what manner they have
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:65196:222"/>
treated <hi>Caesar,</hi> with the Injuries that we have suffered, will not find in our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
either Passion, Injustice or Cruelty. Since <hi>Caesar</hi> their General, their High
Priest, who had subdued Nations ever before formidable to the Roman People:
Had first of all crossed an unknown Sea beyond the Columns of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the Romans away to a New World; has been murdered in a Sacred Place,
in the midst of the Palace, in the sight of the Gods, basely stabbed with three
and twenty Wounds of Daggers, by people whose lives he had saved after having
made them Prisoners at War: Nay, some of which he had by Testament made
his Heirs. Whilst instead of punishing this Attempt, others transported by the
same hatred, have made them Governors of Provinces; or else abusing their
Power, have seized upon the Revenues of the Commonwealth, raised Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us; calling to their Assistance Barbarians, perpetual Enemies to this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
and burning, sacking and rasing some Cities under our Obedience, that would
not submit to theirs; and forcing others by threats and terror to take Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us and their Country. Some of these we have already punished, and by
God's Assistance you shall see us punish others. But because after those great
things we have done for the security of <hi>Spain, Gaul,</hi> and the Heart of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
there yet remains a troublesome Affair, which is the Expedition against
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s Murderers: To effect which we must cross the Sea; being ready, for the
Service of the Publick, to carry our Arms into a remote Country, we cannot
think it either secure or advantagious for us to leave behind us our Enemies, who
will not fail to make their best use of our absence, and of the uncertain Success of
War. There may likewise be danger in delay; wherefore we have resolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them, since they have begun to persecute us by declaring us Enemies of our
Country. And though neither respect to Gods, nor fear of Men restrained them
from endeavouring to destroy with us so many thousand Citizens, yet will we not
imitate them, nor offend any of the people; nay, nor so much as hold all those
for Enemies who have took part against us, or have disobliged us. We will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
no person because of his Riches and Dignities, nor put so many to death as
did another who had the same power before us; and who having, as well as we,
undertaken to remedy the Mischiefs caused by Civil War, deserved the Title of
<hi>HAPPY,</hi> for the happy success of his Enterprizes; though it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
he could have so many Enemies as we three. We will therefore only pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
such as are the most criminal, and most guilty of those Mischiefs the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth groans under; which will be no less advantagious to you than to our
selves: for as long as our Dissentions last, it will be impossible for you, whilst
things hang between two, not to suffer extraordinarily. Besides, it is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to satisfie the Soldiery offended, that without reason you have declared them
Enemies. And though we could without notice punish those we think worthy of
it, yet we think fit rather to proscribe than to surprize them; which indeed we do
for your sakes, lest the Soldier's anger might transport him against those are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned,
or to destroy others with those whose Names are fixed up in publick
places. For these reasons we forbid all persons the receiving into their Houses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of those whose Names are inserted in the Roll of the Proscribed, or to conceal
or send them to any place of security, or to furnish them with Money, under pain
that all that shall be found convicted of having secured or relieved them, shall
be put themselves into the number of the Proscribed, without hopes of Pardon.

Such was the Ordinance of Proscription made by the Triumvirs. <hi>Lepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
proscribed the first, and his Brother <hi>Paulus</hi> was the first Proscript. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
proscribed the second, and his Uncle <hi>Lucius</hi> was the second Proscript;
because they had first given their Opinions when they were declared Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of their Country. The third and fourth Proscripts, whose Names
were put in another Table, were the two Consuls designed for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Year, <hi>Plotius,</hi> Brother of <hi>Plancus,</hi> and <hi>Quintus,</hi> Father in Law to <hi>Asi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi>
who were not named with the first only because of their Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
but to strike terror, and make Men lose all hopes of escaping. And
indeed, <hi>Thoranius</hi> was found among the Proscribed; he who, as it is said,
had been <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Tutor. The Proscription being published, Guards were
forthwith placed at the Gates; and all the Avenues of the City, at the Sea-Ports,
and in the Marshes, and in all places where there was any likelihood
an unhappy Man might shelter himself: Besides, Centurions were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
abroad, to make search in the Country, which was done all at an
instant; so that both within and without the City many persons dyed sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly of several kinds of Deaths. The Streets were filled with the sad Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle
of Heads carrying to the Triumvirs, to receive the Reward; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
step some Person of Quality endeavouring to save himself, was met
shamefully disguised; some running down into Wells, and others into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies;
some hiding themselves in the tops of the Chimneys, or under the
Tiles, where they durst not utter a sigh or groan; for they stood in more
fear of their Wives, or Children, or Freed Men, or Slaves, or Debtors, or
Neighbours that coveted some of their Goods, than of the Murderers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
All private Grudges were now discovered; and it was a strange
change to see the prime Men of the Senate, Consulars, Pretors, Tribunes,
or Pretenders to these Dignities cast themselves at the feet of their Slaves
with tears in their eyes, begging and caressing them, calling them their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viors
and Patrons; and which is most deplorable, not be able with all these
submissions to obtain the least favour. The most pernicious Seditions and
cruellest of Wars never had any thing in them so terrible as the Calamities
wherewith the City was now affrighted; for in War and Tumult none but
Enemies were feared, and Domesticks were confided in; whereas now
Domesticks were more dreadful than Enemies, because having no cause to
fear for themselves, as in War or Tumult, from Familiars they became of
a suddain Persecutors; either out of a dissembled hate, or out of hope of
Recompence publickly proposed, or because of some Silver or Gold hid in
the House: So that no person found himself secure in his House, Servants
being ordinarily more sensible of Profit than of the Affection they owe to
their Masters; and though some might be found faithful and kind, yet they
durst not assist a Proscript, nor conceal him, nor so much as stay with him,
for fear of falling into the same misfortune. There was now much more
danger than when the seventeen first proscribed were fallen upon; for then
no person being publickly proscribed, when on a suddain they saw some
killed, one Man defended another, for fear lest the same should happen to
him. But after the Proscription was published, those comprized in it were
presently forsaken by all the World; some that thought themselves secure,
having their minds bent on Profit, sought them to deliver them to the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, that they might have the Reward; others pillaged the Houses of
those that had been killed, and with the present gain comforted themselves
against the Publick Misery. The most Prudent and Moderate surprized
at a thing so extraordinary, stood like Men astonished, considering that, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:65196:223"/>
Cities turmoiled with Divisions were re-established by the Concord of
their Citizens: Whereas the Romans, already afflicted with Civil Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions,
compleated their Ruin by this Reconciliation. Some were killed
defending themselves; others, who thought themselves not condemned,
without any defence: Some let themselves die with hunger, or hanged,
or drowned themselves, or threw themselves headlong from the tops of
Houses, or cast themselves into the Fire, or run to meet their Murderers:
Others again sought to protract the time; and either hid themselves, or
begged shamefully, or fled, or offered Money to save their Lives. Many
likewise were slain contrary to the intention of the Triumvirs, either by
mistake, or out of some particular grudge; but the Bodies of the Proscripts
might be known from the others, because they wanted the Head, which
was cut off, and carried before the Tribunal for Orations, where they pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Reward. On the other side, wonderful Examples were to be seen
of the Affection of Wives, Children, Brethren and Slaves; who found out
a thousand inventions to save their Husbands, Fathers, Brethren or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
dyed with them when they were discovered, or killed themselves
upon those Bodies they were not able to defend. Of those that escaped the
Proscription, some, pursued by their ill fortune, perished by Shipwrack;
others saved beyond all probability, came afterwards to exercise Dignities
in the City, to have Command of Armies, and arrive at the Honour of
Triumph. Such wonderful things were to be seen in those days which do
not happen in an ordinary City, or in a small Kingdom; but in the Mistress
of the world, as well by Sea as Land: Providence disposing it so to reduce
things to that excellent order wherein you now see them. Not but that
<hi>Rome</hi> felt the same miseries under <hi>Sylla,</hi> and before him under <hi>Marius;</hi> and
we have in writing of them reported many Actions of Cruelty, even to the
depriving their Enemies of Burial: But what passed under the Triumvirs
made much more noise, because of the height of their Reputation; and
particularly the Valour and Good Fortune of him, who having fixed the
Foundations of this Empire, has left it to those of his Race and Name, even
to this present. I will therefore relate what was now done most remarkable,
and most cruel; which I can the easier do, because the length of time has
not yet quite effaced the memory of these Actions. Yet I will not write
all; for a common death, or the flight of some private Men, who after ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
Pardon of the Triumvirs, returned and spent the rest of their Lives
without appearing, seems not to me worthy being recorded: But I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
some extraordinary Examples, that the Reader may be perswaded of
the truth of what I have before said. Many Roman Authors have hereof
wrote particular Books; out of which I have extracted what appeared most
credible, to compose a Summary, which may well make the happiness of
our Times be admired.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> The Massacre unhappily began with the Magistracy, of whom the first
slain was <hi>Salvius,</hi> Tribune of the People; though by the Laws the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
were holy and inviolable; and so powerful, that sometimes they
have imprisoned Consuls. This Man when they were about to declare <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
Enemy opposed it, but afterwards he took part with <hi>Cicero.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when he knew the Triumvirs were agreed, and marched towards the
City, he made a Feast for his Domesticks, as having now but a short time
to live with them. The Soldiers entring the place where they were eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
all the people affrighted, began to rise up; but the Centurion comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them to keep their places, took <hi>Salvius</hi> by the Hair, drew him over
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:65196:223"/>
The Table, cut off his Head, and forbid the others from stirring; for if
they made the least noise he would serve them in the same manner: At
which they were so affrighted, that after the Centurion was gone they
spent most part of the Night by the Body, without speaking a word.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Salvius,</hi> was slain the Pretor <hi>Minutius.</hi> Upon notice brought him
as he gave Audience in the place, that the Soldiers were coming towards
him, he rose suddainly to seek out some place to shelter himself in: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
changed Cloaths, went to hide himself in a Shop; but his People, and
those that carried the Marks of his Dignity, whom he commanded to leave
him, staying there some time out of a fear and affection they had for him,
were the occasion, without designing it, that the Murderers did the more
easily find him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Annalis</hi> the other Pretor, as he solicited the People for his Son, who deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Questors Office; his Friends and Lictors understanding that he was
in the Roll of the Proscripts, all of a suddain left him: Whereupon he fled,
and retired into a wretched House that one of his Creatures had in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs;
where, because the place was utterly contemptible, he was for a
while secure; till such time as his own Son, having some doubt he was gone
thither, shewed the way to the Executioners of the Proscription: In reward
whereof the Triumvirs gave him his Father's Estate, and the Office of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile,</hi>
but he enjoyed not either long; for returning drunk from a Debauch,
upon some reviling words given to the Soldiers who had killed his Father,
they killed him too.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Thoranius,</hi> who was not Pretor, but had been; he was Father to a
wretchless Youth, who yet had a great deal of power over <hi>Anthony.</hi> He
therefore entreated the Centurions to delay his death but so long till his Son
had begged him of the Triumvir. To which they laughing, answered;
<hi>He has already begged you, but it is in another manner.</hi> Which the Old Man
hearing, prayed them but to give him so much time as to see his Daughter;
and having seen her, forbad her from pretending any thing to his Estate,
le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t her Brother should beg her likewise of <hi>Anthony.</hi> The end of this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Son was no better than the others; for after having consumed his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
in all sorts of Debauchery, he was accused of Theft, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Banishment.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Cicero,</hi> who had ruled in the Assemblies of the People after <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
death; he was proscribed, with his Son, his Brother, and all their Servants,
Clients and Friends. He was embarked on a small Boat to make his Escape
by Sea; but not able to endure the tossing of the Waves, he returned to a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
that belonged to him near <hi>Capua;</hi> which upon occasion of writing this
History, I would needs see. As he reposed himself, and that those that
sought him were not far off (for of all the Proscripts, <hi>Anthony</hi> caused him to
be sought with most diligence) a Flock of Crows flying over the place
where he slept, waked him with their Cries, and began with their Beaks to
pull the Covering from off him; till his Slaves thinking it an Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Gods, returned him into his Litter, and took their way towards
the Sea, through the thickest of the Forest. Presently after several Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
coming to that place one after another, and demanding of those they
met if they had not seen <hi>Cicero,</hi> they all, out of the compassion they had for
him, answered, that he was embarked, and was already a good way off at
Sea: But a Shoo-maker called <hi>Cerdo,</hi> a Creature to <hi>Clodius,</hi> formerly a
mortal Enemy to <hi>Cicero;</hi> having shewed the Centurion <hi>Laena,</hi> followed but
by a few Soldiers, the way he had taken, he presently pursued him: <hi>Cicero</hi>
was accompanied with more people disposed to defend him, than <hi>Laena</hi> had
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:65196:224"/>
with him to assault him. Wherefore having overtaken him, he made use
of policy; and began to cry out as if he had called to other Centurions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him; <hi>Come on, Gentlemen, come on.</hi> Whereupon the people of the
Proscript imagining that they were about to be over-pressed by numbers,
grew fearful, and deserted him. Then <hi>Laena,</hi> though <hi>Cicero</hi> had formerly
pleaded for him in a Cause wherein he overcame, drew his Head out of the
Litter, and cut it, or rather hewed it off, at three blows; so unhardy he
was. He likewise cut off the Hand wherewith he had writ the Orations,
accusing <hi>Anthony</hi> of Tyranny; which after the example of <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> he
called the <hi>Philippicks:</hi> And at the same instant dispatching away Expresses
both by Sea and Land to carry, this pleasing News to <hi>Anthony,</hi> he himself
followed them to <hi>Rome;</hi> where finding <hi>Anthony</hi> in the place, seated in the
Tribunal, he shewed him at a distance the Head and Hand of <hi>Cicero.</hi> And
he ravished with joy, put a Crown upon the Centurion's Head, and gave
him for a Reward<note n="*" place="margin">Almost eight thousand Pound.</note> two hundred and fifty thousand Attick Drams; as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
freed him of the greatest of all his Enemies, and from whom he had
received the highest injuries. His Head and Hand stood a long time for a
Spectacle before the Tribunal, where he used to make his Orations: And
more flocked now thither to see him, than did before to hear him. It is said
likewise, that <hi>Anthony</hi> at a Collation caused the Head to be set upon the
Table that he might contemplate it more at leisure, and satiate himself (as
we may so say) with the view of it. Thus was <hi>Cicero</hi> slain; to this day in
great Esteem for his Eloquence: And who, when he acted in the Quality
of Consul, had done signal Services to his Country; yet after his death he
was thus unworthily treated by his Enemies.</p>
               <p>His Son was already escaped to <hi>Brutus</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> but his Brother and
Nephew were unhappily taken by the Soldiers. The Father begged he
might die before his Son, and the Son requested he might die before his
Father; and they having promised to satisfie them both, took them apart,
and slew them at the same instant.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Egnatius</hi> and his Son embracing each other, died together; and
their Heads being both struck off at one blow, the two Bodies kept still their
hold of each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Balbus</hi> designing to escape with his Son by Sea, sent him before, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that by not going together they would not so easily be known; and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
soon after set forward to follow him at a distance: but some one, either
out of malice or mistake, having told him that his Son was taken, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of his own accord to offer himself to the Excutioners, and his Son pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
by Ship-wrack: So much did fortune contribute to the Calamities
of these times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aruntius</hi> had a Son that could not resolve to fly without him; yet at
length he prevailed so far as to perswade him, that being young, he ought
to survive him. The Mother having been his Guide as far as the City
Gates, returned speedily to give Burial to her Husband whom they had
slain. And some days after hearing her Son was starved to death at Sea,
she slew her self.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have proposed Examples of good and evil Children.</p>
               <p>As for Brothers. Those two called <hi>Ligarii,</hi> proscribed together, lay hid
in an Oven, till such time as being betrayed by their Slaves, one was slain
at the same time; and the other who slipped from the Executioners, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Brother was dead, cast himself from the Bridge into the River.
Some Fisher-men that thought he fell in by mischance, and not designedly,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:65196:224"/>
came in to save him; from which he defended himself some time by plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself to the bottom of the Water: till such time as they pulling him
out, do what he could, he told them; <hi>You do not save me, but lose your selves
with a Proscript.</hi> Yet, say what he could, they were resolved to save his
Life. But the Soldiers who had the Guard of the Bridge understanding he
was a Proscript, came in and cut off his Head.</p>
               <p>Of two other Brothers, one having cast himself headlong into the River,
his Slave, after having sought the Body five days, at length found it; and
in the condition he was, being hardly to be known, cut off his Head, and
carried it to the Tribune to have the Reward. The other being hid in a
Privy, was betrayed by another Slave; and because the Soldiers vouchsafed
not to go down, they slew him with Javelins, drew him out; and in the
condition he was cut off his Head without washing it.</p>
               <p>Another seeing his Brother stopped, ran in; and without knowing that
he likewise was proscribed, cryed out, <hi>Kill me first.</hi> Whereupon the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion,
who knew the order of the Roll, made answer; <hi>You ask but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
for your Name does indeed stand in the Roll before his:</hi> And therewith
slew one after the other.</p>
               <p>These are Examples of Brothers.</p>
               <p>As for Wives. <hi>Ligarius</hi> his Wife had hid him; and went from time to
time to see him, attended only by one Maid; who betraying him, she fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
those who carried away her Husband's Head, crying out; <hi>It is I
that hid him, the Concealers are condemned to the same Punishment.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no one would either kill or accuse her, she went and discovered her
self to the Magistrates: who not judging her guilty for loving her Husband,
she starved her self to death.</p>
               <p>I have spoke of her in this place, because, having in vain endeavoured to
save her Husbands Life, she would not survive him: for as for those whose
Conjugal Affection had better success, we will reserve them to another
place, when we are to speak of those escaped.</p>
               <p>Here therefore we shall now only relate Examples of such as made
wretched Attempts upon the Lives of their Husbands; among whom <hi>Septi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi>
Wife shall have the first place. It was a long time before that one of
<hi>Anthony</hi>'s Friends had abused her Husband's Bed: But she desiring rather
to be his Wife than his Mistress, he prevailed so far by the Credit he had
with <hi>Anthony,</hi> that <hi>Septimius</hi> was found among the number of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts.
He was advertized of it by her own self: And knowing nothing
of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>onour of his House, disposed himself to Flight. But she, like
a kind Wife, shut the Doors; and kept him very diligently, till the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xecutioners
came to rid her of him; and the same day of her Husband's
death espoused the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salassius</hi> had escaped; but out of a belief the danger diminished, was so
imprudent as to return by Night into the City. In the mean time his House
was sold, and there remained in it of all his People none but the Porter,
who was comprized in the Sale: So that he alone knowing him, made him
come into his Lodge, promised to keep him close, and to feed him the best
he could. He was no sooner entred but he sent for his Wife, who was
lodged elsewhere: who professed a great passion to see her Husband; but
excusing her self upon the fear of the Night, and the suspicion she had of
the fidelity of her Servants, she said, she would not come till the Morrow.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:65196:225"/>
As soon as it was Day she went to seek for Executioners, and the Porter
went to find her to desire her to come: which was the occasion that <hi>Salassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
missing the Porter, began to fear some treachery; and got up to the top
of the House to expect the event: whence beholding not the Porter, but
Soldiers coming under his Wife's Conduct, he precipitated himself from top
to bottom.</p>
               <p>In like manner <hi>Fulvius</hi> having sought for refuge in the House of a certain
Woman, who having been his Slave and Concubine, he made free and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried:
for so many good turns she betrayed him, jealous that he had espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
another woman. But I have said enough of wicked Women.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Statius</hi> the Samnite, who had performed many great Services for his
Country in the War with the Allies: After which, by his worthy Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Riches and Birth, he was arrived to the Dignity of Roman Senator:
being proscribed at the age of fourscore Years only for his Riches, caused
his House to be ransacked by the People and his Slaves, who carried away
what they could, the rest he himself threw into the Street; and barring his
Doors, set fire to his House, wherein he was burnt with a good part of the
City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Capito</hi> having half opened the Door of his House, so that but one at a
time could enter, slew with his own hands many of the Soldiers; till at last,
over-powred by numbers, he was himself slain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vitulinus</hi> assembled about the Country of <hi>Regium</hi> great Forces, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of proscribed Persons, and others who came to take Sanctuary under
him, together with the Inhabitants of those eighteen Cities destined for the
Soldiers Reward after the Victory; which made them desperate: And
with these took the Field; where he cut in pieces all the Centurions he
could meet with that were searching for Proscripts. But the Triumvirs
having sent greater Forces against them, he, without losing heart, crossed
over into <hi>Sicily,</hi> where <hi>Pompey</hi> then commanded, the Refuge of all such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts
as could escape out of <hi>Italy.</hi> After which generously returning to
renew this sort of War, being defeated in several Engagements, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked
his Son, with other Proscripts, to send them before him to <hi>Messina;</hi>
but his own Boat scarce reaching the middle of the Straits, till he was
surrounded by Enemies, he there honourably dyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Naso</hi> having been betrayed by a Freed-man, by whom he had been abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
snatched the Sword out of one of the Soldiers hand; and after having
slain the Traitor, offered them his own Throat.</p>
               <p>A certain faithful Slave had left his Master hid in a Sepulchre, while he
went to the Sea to hire a Boat. His Return happened to be just at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
that the Soldiers were murdering his Master; to whom, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ing him
ready to die, he cryed out, <hi>Stay a little, my dear Master:</hi> and at the same
minute falling upon a Centurion, slew him first, and then himself; saying,
<hi>Now Master, you have some cause of Comfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucius</hi> having two Freed-men, upon whose fidelity he relyed, gave them
his Money to carry to the Sea, where he designed to embark: but they run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
away with what they were intrusted with, he returns; and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
himself to death, delivers himself up to the Murderers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Labienus,</hi> who in the Proscription of <hi>Sylla</hi> had taken and destroyed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
had been a Coward if he had not bravely born what he had made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
suffer. Wherefore, coming out before the Gates of his House, he
sat him down in a Chair, expecting some who would come and cut off his Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:65196:225"/>
                  <hi>Cestius,</hi> who lay concealed in a Country-house with faithful Slaves, seeing
armed Centurions daily pass by carrying of Heads, could not longer endure
to live in that continual fear; but having commanded his Slaves to raise a
Pile of Wood, and set fire to it, that they might tell those that passed they
burnt the Body of <hi>Cestius,</hi> threw himself into it in good earnest.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apomius</hi> was in a place of Security: But not able to accustom himself to
such course Provisions as were brought him, went out to seek his death.</p>
               <p>Another publickly waiting for the Executioners; because they came not
soon enough, strangled himself before all the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucius,</hi> Father in Law of <hi>Asinius</hi> now Consul, having escaped by Sea;
not able to endure the tossing of the Waves, threw himself over-board.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sisinius</hi> being pursued by Soldiers; and crying out he was not proscrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but they had a mind to destroy him for his Riches, was led to a place
where the Names of the Proscripts were affixed, thrt he might see his own;
which having read, they cut off his Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aemilius</hi> not knowing himself was of the number of the Proscribed, and
seeing another that fled, asked the Centurion who that Proscript was: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the Centurion knowing him, replyed; <hi>Thou art one as well as he:</hi>
and so slew them both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cilon</hi> and <hi>Decius</hi> being informed as they came out of the Palace, that
their Names were in the Roll of the Proscripts; before any one set upon
them, took their way towards the Gate so affrighted, that their Flight alone
made them known to the Centurions, had the Guard of the Avenues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Icilius,</hi> the same that in the Judgment of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> when <hi>Caesar</hi>
sate President, when all the other Judges gave privately their Votes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
them, alone durst publickly argue for their Discharge, remembred
not himself in this occasions of that great Generosity; for seeing a dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
carrying out of the City, he set to his Shoulder with the rest, that so he
might gain a passage in favour of the Bier: But the Guards at the Gate
perceiving there more people than were usually employed in that Office;
yet without doubting of them, would only know if they did not carry a live
Body instead of a dead: Which occasioned that <hi>Icilius</hi> being disowned by
the rest, was known, and at the same time slain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Varus</hi> being betrayed by one of his Freed-men, fled; and taking the way
of the Mountains, got to the Marshes of <hi>Minturnum,</hi> where he hid himself
to take a little repose. Mean time those of <hi>Minturnum</hi> coming by chance
to seek for Thieves who often run thither for Shelter, seeing the Leaves of
the Bushes shake, discovered him. So that being taken, and confessing
himself to be a Thief, they condemned him to death: But seeing that they
went to put him upon the Rack, to make him confess his Companions, he
told them; <hi>I give you notice, my Masters, that I have been Consul, and am
proscribed: in which Quality I am more considerable to those that now govern<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that you ought not have the boldness either to torment or put me to death; for
since my death is inevitable, I had rather die by my Equals.</hi> The Judges had
much ado to believe him, and thought it only a Fiction, when a Centurion
arriving, knew him, cut off his Head, and left the rest of his Body to the
People of <hi>Minturnum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Largus</hi> found in the Country by Soldiers that sought for another, they
had pity of a Man fallen into their Hands unlooked for, and let him escape
into the Woods; where being met and pursued by others, he run again to
the first; crying out, <hi>Kill me, you that would have saved me; for I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you than others should have the Rewards.</hi> Thus dying, he made his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
of their good will.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:65196:226"/>
                  <hi>Rufus,</hi> who was Neighbour to <hi>Fulvia, Anthony</hi>'s Wife, having a very
fine House which formerly he had refused to sell her, though now he would
gladly have given it her, was found among the number of the Proscripts.
His Head being brought to <hi>Anthony,</hi> he said, it belonged not to him; and
sent it to his Wife: who caused it not to be nailed up in the Publick Place,
but before the same House.</p>
               <p>Another having a House of Pleasure in the Country with a magnificent
Garden, wherein was a deep and beautiful <hi>Grotto,</hi> which had been the
cause of his Proscription. One day, as he was refreshing himself in his
<hi>Grotto,</hi> one of his Slaves espying the Soldiers afar off, hid him in the obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
part of the Cave; and taking his Cloaths, presented himself to the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in such a frightful posture as if he indeed had been his Master: And
certainly he might have passed for him, had not another of his Slaves disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the Deceit. Thus the Master being slain, the people incensed against
the Traytor, never left importuning the Magistrates till he was hanged,
and that the other had obtained his Liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aterius</hi> being likewise hid, one of his Slaves discovered him; and for it
had his Liberty. But not content therewith when the Goods of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
were publickly sold, and that the Children would have bought them,
he not only out-bid them, but reviled them with words; which they seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not at all to resent, but still followed him every where with tears in their
eyes, till such time as the people were so much incensed, that the Triumvirs
condemning his Avarice, revoked his Liberty, and remitted him under the
power of the Children of the Proscript.</p>
               <p>One would have thought this Cruelty should have been exercised only
upon persons grown, at least to full years; it extended it self even to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan
Children, with intent to spoil them of their Riches. And one was
killed as he went to School with his Master; who held the Child so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
embraced, they could not pull him out of his arms.</p>
               <p>Another, called <hi>Attilius,</hi> had the same day taken the Robe Virile; and
his Friends conducted him to the Temple, to offer Sacrifices, ordinary up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those occasions: when he was inserted in the Roll of the Proscripts, his
Slaves and Friends all presently fled every one his way; and he remaining
alone, forsaken of all his great Train, retired to his Mother; who was so
frighted, that she refused him her House. So that not daring to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to any other person after being so treated by a Mother, he fled to the
top of a Mountain: whence Hunger forcing him to descend, he fell into
the hands of one of those Thieves who steal Free Persons to make them
Slaves. This Young Man, tenderly bred, and not able to undergo Labour
and Hardship, escaped chained as he was, and recovered the publick Road;
where presenting himself to the first Centurion passed by, he ended his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> Mean while <hi>Lepidus</hi> triumphed over the Spaniards; and to that purpose
published an Ordinance drawn up to this effect. <hi>All Persons of what Degree
soever are enjoyned to employ this day in Feasts, Sacrificing and Rejoycing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pain of Proscription.</hi> After that he mounted in Triumph to the Capitol,
accompanied by all the most remarkable Persons of the City; chearful in
appearance, but with Souls oppressed with Hate and Anger. As for the
Goods of the Proscribed, they plundered their Houses, but they found few
Purchasers of their Lands; for most Men were ashamed to add to their
Misfortunes, and believed ill luck would attend themselves should they deal
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:65196:226"/>
in such Goods. Besides, there was no security for such as were known to
have Money; and it was so dangerous to make new Acquisitions, that no
Man was secure of what he held from his Ancestors. There were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
none but very bold men that bought: and because they were but few,
they had them for a small matter. So that the Triumvirs, who thought
that the Moneys hereby raised would serve for the Expence of the War;
found it to fall short<note n="*" place="margin">Of Dram<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> two hundred Millions. They thereupon in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
acquainted the People with their Wants, and proscribed fourteen
hundred of the richest Women of the City; to whom they commanded to
come and declare what Riches they had, to be employed in the Necessities
of the State, as the Triumvirs thought convenient: and strictly forbidding,
all Concealments whatsoever, or valuing things below their true Value, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pain of Punishment; with promise of a Reward to any that should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
of such an Omission, whether Free Man or Slave. The Women, as
soon as they had notice of it, having resolved to become Suitors to the Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of the Triumvirs, to solicite them in their behalf, were favourably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Sister, and <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Mother; but <hi>Fulvia,</hi> his Wife, shut
the Gate against them. They were so concerned at the Affront, that they
came in a Body to the Place; and the People and Guards making way for
them, they advanced to the Tribunal of the Triumvirs: where <hi>Hortensia,</hi>
before prepared to that purpose, spoke to them in this manner, in the name
of all the rest.</p>

But having received from <hi>Fulvia</hi> an affront which even Decency and Good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
forbid her to put upon us, we are forced to come hither to speak for our
selves. You have deprived us of our Fathers, our Children, our Husbands, and
our Brothers, accused of the Crime of having offended you; if after that you
spoil us of our Goods, you will reduce us to Extremities unbecoming our Birth,
our Quality, and our Sex. If you perhaps say we have offended you as well as the
Men, proscribe us in the same manner: But if none of you have been declared
Enemy by the Women; if we have neither demolished your Houses, nor defeated
your Armies, nor given your Dignities to others, nor hindred you from being
preferred to Honours and Magistracies, why are we equally punished? Why do
you exact Contributions from us, who pretend nothing to Dignities, nor Honours,
nor Command of Armies, nor Government of the State, nor all those things for
which you dispute among your selves with so much Heat and Obstinacy? But it is
because you have War you inflict this on us: Was the World ever without War?
And were Women ever made contribute to it, whom Nature dispenses with by the
general Consent of all Nations upon Earth? I know well that in the time of our

thinking it strange, that where Men were silent, Women should
dare to speak, and be so bold as to demand of the Magistrates an
account of their Actions, and refuse to contribute Money to a War,
to which Men payed their persons, commanded the Ushers to make
them withdraw from the Tribunal; but the multitude beginning to
cry out, the Ushers stopped, and the Triumvirs adjourned the business till
the morrow. As soon as it was day, of fourteen hundred Proscripts they
retrenched a thousand, and only taxed four hundred; and for the Men it
was decreed, that whoever had more than one hundred thousand Drams ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective;

Whilst these Ordinances were published at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Soldiers contemning
their Officers, committed greater disorders in the Country, for the power

Men uncondemned, or plundered the Houses of private men, insomuch
that the Triumvirs deputed one of the Consuls to chastise them, but he
durst not touch the Soldiers, for fear of incensing them against himself, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
took occasion to hang a few Slaves, who in Soldiers habit committed the
same Violences.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> After having related the miseries of the Proscripts, I think it expedient
to speak of those who escaped beyond their own hopes, or came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to Dignity in the City, such Examples not being unprofitable to the
Reader, who from thence may learn not to lose courage in the worst of
misfortunes. A great part of these who could get out of <hi>Italy</hi> made their
retreat to <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> and some to <hi>Cornificius,</hi> who likewise stood
for the People in <hi>Africa,</hi> but the greatest part escaped into <hi>Sicily,</hi> which is
nigh unto <hi>Italy,</hi> where <hi>Pompey</hi> took care to receive them, and did in this
unhappy occasion great services to these miserable People; for in the first
place he caused it to be published, that whoever would make their retreat
to him, should be welcome, and that he would give to those who saved a
Proscript, whether he were Freeman or Slave, double the reward which
the Triumvirs promised to the Murderers. Then he appointed great
numbers of Barques and other Vessels to go out and meet such as might be
escaped to Sea, and his Gallys continually cruised along the Coasts, making
Signals to all that passed, and receiving all such as would embarque on
them, whom at their landing he in person received, furnished them with
Cloaths and Necessaries, and to such as were worthy gave Command in his
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:65196:227"/>
Army by Sea or Land, and declared he would never come to an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
with the Triumvirs, unless those who had fled for refuge to him
were comprised in it. Thus he beneficially served his Country, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Glory derived from his Father, made himself illustrious by his
own Virtue. Others that fled or hid themselves in Country Houses, or in
Sepulchres, or in the City it self, lived miserably, and in perpetual fear, till
the persecution was overpassed, which lasted a good time, during which
were found wonderful examples of Friendship, of Wives for their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
of Children for their Parents, and even of Slaves to their Masters,
of which we will relate the most memorable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paulus</hi> Brother to <hi>Lepidus</hi> being proscribed by himself, the Centurions
had yet respect for him as he was their General's Brother, so that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
in safety to <hi>Brutus,</hi> and after <hi>Brutus</hi>'s death to <hi>Miletum,</hi> from
whence, though after the peace he were recalled, he vouchsafed not to
come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucius, Anthony</hi>'s Uncle, was received into his Sister's House, who
kept him a long time without concealing him, because the Centurions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
her as Mother to their General; yet at last when they would have
entred, she run to the place, and <hi>Anthony</hi> with his Colleagues being seated
on the Tribunal, <hi>I accuse my self, Sir,</hi> (said she) <hi>that I have received and
will receive</hi> Lucius <hi>into my House till such time as you put us both to death
together, since the Proscripts and those that receive them are equally guilty. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
answered her, that she was a good Sister, but an ill Mother, and
that she either ought not now to save <hi>Lucius,</hi> or have hindred him before
from declaring her Son Enemy; yet he took such order, that the Consul
<hi>Plancus</hi> exempted him from punishment by a Decree of the People.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Messala,</hi> a young Man of noblest Birth, having made his escape to <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
the Triumvirs, who feared him because of his Generosity, revoked
his Proscription in these terms: <hi>Since the Kindred of <hi>Messala</hi> have attested to
us that he was not in the City when <hi>Caesar</hi> was killed, we have decreed that he be
erazed out of the Roll of the Proscripts.</hi> But he would not accept their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
and yet after <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> were killed in <hi>Thrace,</hi> when the
Army being yet in a good condition, and wanted neither Ships nor Money
nor hopes, had chosen him General, he refused it; nay, on the contrary,
perswaded the Soldiers to yield to fortune, and take part with <hi>Anthony.</hi>
After which he was one of his particular Friends, till such time as affronted
by <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> he withdrew to <hi>Caesar,</hi> who made him Consul in the room of
<hi>Anthony</hi> after he was declared Enemy the second time. After which he
served under <hi>Caesar</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Actium;</hi> and in conclusion <hi>Caesar</hi> having
sent him against the revolted Gauls he defeated them, and deserved the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Triumph.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bibulus,</hi> who gained <hi>Anthony</hi>'s favour at the same time with <hi>Messala,</hi>
and was some time Admiral of his Fleet against <hi>Caesar,</hi> got at last the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Syria,</hi> where he died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Acilius,</hi> who was dragged out of the City, having been delivered to the
Soldiers by one of his Slaves, perswaded them by hopes of great gain to
send some of their company to his Wife with the tokens he gave them.
They going, she shewed them her Jewels, and told them she would give
them all, on condition they would release him, which they promised to do,
and though she doubted of their promise, yet her friendship to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
was worthy not to be deceived, and the Soldiers hired a Boat for <hi>Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
and sent him for <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lentulus</hi> being watched by his Wife, for fear he should fly without her,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65196:228"/>
and he was unwilling she should hazard her self in the danger with him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped
secretly into <hi>Sicily,</hi> where being made Pretor, he wrote to her the
happy success of his flight, and the Honour he had received from <hi>Pompey.</hi>
When she knew where her Husband was, she stole from her vigilant Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and only with two Slaves and her self in the habit of a Servant came
with much trouble and labour to <hi>Rhegium,</hi> from whence towards Evening
she got passage to <hi>Messina;</hi> where having easily found the Pretor's House,
she found <hi>Lentulus,</hi> not in the Equipage of a Pretor, but lying on the
ground upon a Mattress, with untrimmed Hair and a slender Supper, all out
of grief and impatience to see his Wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>us</hi>'s Wife threatned to have him taken if he fled away alone; so
that he was constrained to carry her along with him, which made none be
suspicious of his flight, seeing him march publickly with his Wife, Men,
and Maid-Servants. And <hi>Antius</hi> his Wife wrapped him in Coverlids, and
made him be carried like a Pack to the Sea side, from whence he escaped
into <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reginus</hi> his Wife made her Husband by night go down the Privy, of
which he smelt so strong next Morning, that the Soldiers loath to come
near him, the next day she cloathed him like a Collier, giving him an Ass
loaden with Charcoal to drive before him, and she at a finall distance went
before in her Litter. One of the Soldiers that had the Guard of the Gate
had some suspicion of the Litter, and would needs see what was in it. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus,</hi>
who was in fear for his Wife, came up praying the Soldier (as in
passing) not to affront Women: and the Soldier having at first given him
a surly answer as to a Collier, at last knowing him, for he had born Arms
under him in <hi>Syria,</hi> said to him, <hi>Save your self without fearing any thing,
my General, for it is yet reasonable that I call you so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Copponius</hi> by means of his Wife, who had been chaste hitherto, got his
pardon of <hi>Anthony;</hi> but she remedied one mischief by another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Geta</hi>'s Son made a Funeral Pile for his Father's Body, as if he had strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himself, and sent to hide him at a Town he had lately purchased in the
Country, where the old man, the better to disguise himself, clapped a
Plaister on one eye: and after the Peace was concluded, found that for
want of making use of his eye, he was indeed blind of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oppius</hi> refusing to flie, because he was already old and infirm, his Son
took him upon his Shoulders, carried him out of the City, and laboured
so long, that sometimes leading, and sometimes carrying him, he brought
him at last to <hi>Sicily,</hi> without any ones having the least suspicion, or doing
them the least injury. Thus we paint <hi>Aeneas,</hi> respected by his Enemies
themselves, for carrying his Father. The people afterwards gave the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dility</hi>
to this young Man, out of respect to his Piety, and because his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
estate being confiscate, he had nothing to defray the expence of those
Plays, the Artizans with one accord supplyed him gratis with whatever he
wanted from each several Trade, and every Spectator cast what Money he
pleased on the Stage, so that he became rich.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arrianus</hi> likewise by Will ordered this Epitaph to be engraven on his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre:
<q>Here lie the Ashes of a Proscript, whose Son not proscribed, concealed, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
in his flight, and saved from the Proscription.</q>
               </p>
               <p>There lived in these times two <hi>Metellus</hi>'s, the Father and the Son,
whereof the Father having command under <hi>Anthony</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:65196:228"/>
was taken without being known, the Son siding with <hi>Caesar</hi> had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
under him in the same Battel. When <hi>Caesar</hi> being at Samos would
needs see the Prisoners; this old Man was brought among the rest, his
Hair long, and so filthy, that he was not to be known; but when they
called him in his order of the Roll, the Son who was seated near <hi>Caesar,</hi>
hearing the name of <hi>Metellus,</hi> leaped from his place, and ran with rears
in his eyes to embrace his Father, whom he scarcely knew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
his tears, spoke thus to <hi>Caesar: He bore Arms against you; I have
served you: he deserves punishment, I reward, I beseech you then either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
my Father in consideration of the services I have done you; or let me die
with him for the offences he has committed against you.</hi> This Discourse mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all the Assembly to compassion, <hi>Caesar</hi> promised to give life to <hi>Metellus,</hi>
though he had been his greatest Enemy, and that he could never by any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
he made, oblige him to serve against <hi>Anthony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Slaves of <hi>Maricius</hi> were so faithful, and so fortunate as to keep him
in the House all the time of the Proscription, insomuch that when the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was over, he came out of his House, as if he came out of Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hirtius</hi> being escaped out of the City with his Slaves, went throughout
<hi>Italy,</hi> releasing Prisoners, gathering together Fugitives, and at first plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
small Towns, afterwards greater, till such time as he beheld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
at the Head of considerable Forces, and subdued the Brutians, but the
Triumvirate sending against him a potent Army, he retreated with all his
People to <hi>Pompey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Restion</hi> thinking to flie alone, was privately followed by one of his Slaves
born in his House, whom formerly he had used kindly, but since branded
in his Face with a hot Iron for his Roguery. His Master as he was lying
down in the Marches, seeing him come, was much affrighted, which the
Slave observing, told him the Brand he had set in his Face touched him not
so much as the memory of his former Benefits: and at the same time hiding
him in a Cave, fed him by his labour in the best manner he could; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
perceiving the Soldiers who were not far from the Cave, and
were coming thither upon suspicion some one might be there hid, he fell
upon an old Man that passed by, slew him, and cut off his Head; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Soldiers wondring at the action. and laying hold on him as a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
he told him: <hi>It is</hi> Restion <hi>my Master whom I have thus slain, to revenge these marks of Infamy;</hi> whereupon they presently took from him the
Head, that they might have the reward, which, whilst they in vain went
to seek at the City, he removed his Master thence, and got him a passage
into <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Appius</hi> being in Bed in a small Country House, whither the Soldiers came
to seek him, one of his Slaves pulled off his Cloaths, which making him
put on, he lay down in the Bed as if he had been the Master, and was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
slain for him, <hi>Appius</hi> standing by in the Habit of a Slave.</p>
               <p>In the same manner <hi>Menemius</hi> being besieged by the Soldiers in his
House, one of the Slaves went into his Litter, and caused himself to be
carried out by some of his Comrades, who contributed to his design, and
so was killed for his Master, who by that means escaped for <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Freed Man of <hi>Iunius,</hi> called <hi>Philemon,</hi> who dwelt in a magnificent
House, hid him in a publick Room in a strong Chest made to keep Writings
or Plate, and fed him by night till the time of peace.</p>
               <p>Another Freed Man to whom was committed the keeping of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
Sepulchre, whose Son was likewise proscribed, kept there both Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:65196:229"/>
                  <hi>Lucretius</hi> having wandered some time up and down the Fields with two
faithful Slaves, was at last by hunger forced to return and see his Wife,
causing himself to that end to be carried by the Slaves in his Litter as a sick
Man, one of those that carried him having broke his Leg, he pursued his
way, supporting himself upon the other. But when he came near to that
Gate where his Father, proscribed by <hi>Sylla,</hi> was taken, and saw a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of Soldiers coming towards him, his heart upon the omen of the place
misgave him, and he went and hid himself in a Sepulchre. Certain Thieves
used to rob Sepulchres, coming thither, he let himself be stripped. The
Slave while his Master lay close was gone towards the Gate, where he
waited for him, and when he came, covering him with some part of his
Cloaths, carried him in that manner to his Wife. There was in his House a
Room double floored, where she hid him, till by the intercession of his
Friends he got pardon from the Triumvirs, and after peace was made, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Consulate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sergius</hi> remained some time hid in <hi>Anthony</hi>'s own House, who at last ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
Affairs so, by the means of the Consul <hi>Plancus,</hi> that his return was
assented to; wherefore when <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> after fell at odds, when
the Senate declared <hi>Anthony</hi> Enemy, <hi>Sergius</hi> was the only man that openly
opposed it.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Pomponius,</hi> he took the Habit and Ensign of a Pretor, and having
cloathed his Slaves like Ushers, went as a Pretor all the length of the City
with his Litters, his Officers crowding close about him for fear he should
be known by others; being got out of the Gates he mounted in one of the
publick Coaches, and marching in this Equipage through <hi>Italy,</hi> was every
where received as a Pretor deputed from the Triumvirs to make peace with
<hi>Pompey,</hi> till such time as he passed into <hi>Sicily</hi> upon one of the publick Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apuleius</hi> and <hi>Aruntius</hi> acted the Centurions, armed their Slaves like
Soldiers, and run about the City as if they had pursued some Proscripts.
At length separating, they began to release Prisoners, and to gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Fugitives, till having levyed some Troops, each beheld himself with
Ensigns, Arms, and a certain kind of Army; both one and the other strove
to get the Sea side, and therefore came to encamp on certain eminencies in
view of each other, one mightily afraid of the other. Morning coming on
they took one the other for Enemies, came down from the Hills, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
each other, till at length, knowing their errour, they threw down
their Arms, and with tears embraced, casting this accident on fortune
which had been cross to them in all things. After that they embarqued and
made their retreat, <hi>Aruntius</hi> to <hi>Pompey,</hi> with whom he returned to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and <hi>Apulei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> to <hi>Brutus,</hi> whose Lieutenant he was in the Government
of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> which after <hi>Brutus</hi>'s death falling to <hi>Anthony,</hi> he permitted
him to return to his House.</p>
               <p>As soon as <hi>Ventidius</hi> was proscribed, one of his Freed Men bound him,
as if it were to deliver him to the Executioners, the Night following he
armed all his Slaves like Soldiers, and as if he had been Centurion brought
forth his Patron, and managed his business with so much cunning, that cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in this manner all <hi>Italy</hi> as far as <hi>Sicily,</hi> they lodged often in the same Inn
with other Centurions, under pretence of searching for <hi>Ventidius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another whom his Freed Man had hid in a Sepulchre, being struck with
horrour at such a Lodging, went and hired a wretched Chamber next to
one hired by a Soldier, where not able to endure to live in continual fear, he
passed from infinite terrour to prodigious boldness, and causing himself to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65196:229"/>
be shaved, went and kept a School in <hi>Rome</hi> it self, till such time as peace
was made.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Volusius</hi> being proscribed whilst he was Aedile, had a Friend, Priest to the
Goddess <hi>Isis,</hi> who lent him a Linnen Robe that covered him to the very
Heels, so that passing through the Country in the habit of a Priest to that
Goddess, and every where performing the usual Ceremonies, he escaped
to <hi>Pompey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sittius</hi> a Native of <hi>Cales,</hi> as he was very rich, so he had been at great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
in the service of his Countrymen, in acknowledging of which they
took Arms in his defence, threatened his Slaves with death, if any ill hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to him, and permitted not the Soldiers to approach their Walls, till
such time as the mischief diminishing, they sent to the Triumvirs, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
from them that he might stay in his own Country, banished from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part of <hi>Italy.</hi> So <hi>Sittius</hi> became the only person of all mankind that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was in exile in his own Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Varro</hi> a Philosopher, Historian, Soldier, and General of great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was also proscribed, possibly for being so, as an Enemy to Monarchy.
All his Friends were at strife who should have the Honour to secure him,
<hi>Calenus</hi> carried it, and kept him in a Country House of his, where <hi>Anthony</hi>
often divertised himself as he passed by; yet none, either of <hi>Varro</hi>'s or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus</hi>'s
Slaves discovered him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Virginius</hi> a fair spoken Man perswaded his Domesticks, that if they slew
him for a small gain, which yet they were not sure of, they would be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with eternal remorse of conscience; whereas on the contrary by sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his life they might expect immortal Glory, and hope for rewards
greater and more certain; wherefore, as if they had been one of his
companions, they followed him in his flight, wherein being known by the
Soldiers, he talked to them in the same manner, he told them that there
was no hate between them for which they should kill him, and that doing it
only for Money, they might get more and more honestly if they would go
with him to the Sea side, whither his Wife was to bring all he had. They
believed him, and went along, and indeed his Wife had been there accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to agreement betwixt them, but <hi>Virginius</hi> staying too long,
she believed, that coming there before her he was embarqued, and
therefore embarqued to follow him, yet leaving a Slave on the Shore to
give <hi>Virginius</hi> notice, if he were yet behind. The Slave seeing <hi>Virginius</hi>
coming, ran to meet him, and shewed him the Vessel wherein his Wife
was, not yet out of sight, and withal talked to him of his Wife, his Money,
and the reason why she left him. The Soldiers were so absolutely perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that when <hi>Virginius</hi> entreated them either to stay till he could make
his Wife return, or to embarque with him to go after her, and receive their
Money, they entred with him into the Vessel, and themselves setting hand
to the Oars brought him into <hi>Sicily,</hi> where after having received what he
had promised them, they continued in his service till the time of the
Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rebulus</hi> being in a Vessel that was to carry him for <hi>Sicily,</hi> the Pilot began
to demand Money of him, threatning to discover him if he gave it him
not, to whom <hi>Rebulus</hi> made a like answer, as <hi>Themistocles</hi> had done in his
flight that he would have saved a Proscript for Money, insomuch that the
Pilot affrighted with the answer, brought him speedily to <hi>Pompey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Murcus</hi> was likewise proscribed because he had Command in <hi>Brutus</hi>'s
Army, and being taken after <hi>Brutus</hi> was defeated, he feigned himself a
Slave: <hi>Barbula</hi> bought him, and because he saw him active, gave him the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65196:230"/>
Government of all his other Slaves, and withal made him his Cash-keeper.
<hi>Murcus</hi> behaved himself in this Employment with more prudence than na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ordinarily gives to Slaves, his Master hereupon had some suspicion
of him, and exhorting him to courage, promised to secure him, though
he were one of the Proscripts, which he constantly denyed, telling him
out of his own invention his Name, his Family, and his former Masters.
<hi>Barbula</hi> thereupon carried him to <hi>Rome,</hi> thinking if he were one of the
Proscripts he would be loath to go: however he followed him; but some
time after as <hi>Barbula</hi> was before one of the Consul's Gates, one of his
Friends knowing <hi>Murcus</hi> in his Train in the Habit of a Slave gave him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it, and he by the intercession of <hi>Agrippa</hi> desired his pardon of <hi>Caesar,</hi>
who caused him to be crazed out of the Roll of the Proscripts, esteemed
him afterwards as his Friend, and employed him not long after in the Battel
of <hi>Actium</hi> against <hi>Anthony. Barbula</hi> served under <hi>Anthony,</hi> and fortune
had ordered each of them his turn; for <hi>Barbula</hi> after <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Defeat
was taken prisoner, feigning himself a Slave, <hi>Murcus</hi> bought him as if he
had not known him, and gave advice of it to <hi>Caesar,</hi> from whom he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
power to return him like for like; and this conformity of fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them continued ever; for they were afterwards Colleagues in one
of the highest Dignities of the City.</p>
               <p>Some time after <hi>Lepidus</hi> reduced by <hi>Caesar</hi> to the condition of a private
Man from a Sovereign, that he was constrained by a like necessity to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to <hi>Balbinus,</hi> who escaping the Proscription returned with <hi>Pompey,</hi> and
was now Consul, and thus it happened, <hi>Maecenas</hi> had accused <hi>Lepidus</hi> the
Son, of a Conspiracy against <hi>Caesar,</hi> together with the Mother as an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complice;
for <hi>Lepidus</hi> himself he de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pised as weak. The Son being sent to
<hi>Caesar</hi> then at <hi>Actium, Maecenas</hi> caused it to be ordered, that if the Mother
would be dispensed with from the toil of the Journey, she should give in
such security as the Consul should approve, but none being found would
be bound for her: <hi>Lepidus</hi> having often in vain presented himself before
<hi>Balbinus</hi>'s Gate, and sometimes too before the Tribunal, from whence the
Officers had forced him to retire, had scarce the liberty at last to say these
words: <hi>The accusers themselves are testimonies of my innocency, by saying I
am no Abettor with my Wife and Son. 'Twas not I proscribed you, and at this
day I am my self under the power of Proscribers; wherefore let me beg you to
consider the instability of humane things, and to accept my security for my Wife,
or send me prisoner along with her. Lepidus</hi> having thus spoke, <hi>Balbinus</hi>
moved at this great change, discharged his Wife from the security de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> the Son of the Orator being sent into <hi>Greece</hi> by his Father, who
foresaw the miseries that afterwards happened, retired first to <hi>Brutus,</hi> and
afterwards to <hi>Pompey,</hi> and had both under one and the other very honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Employments in the War. At last <hi>Caesar</hi> to make it appear he had not
consented to his Father's death, made his Son first Pontifex or High Priest,
some time after Consul, and in the end Proconsul of <hi>Syria:</hi> and then when
<hi>Caesar</hi> after having defeated <hi>Anthony</hi> at <hi>Actium,</hi> wrote news of it to <hi>Rome:
Cicero</hi> as Consul read it in full Assembly, and fixed a Copy before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
for Orations, where formerly his Father's Head had been exposed.</p>

               <p>Whilst these things passed at <hi>Rome,</hi> all the rest of the Empire concern'd <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/>
either for one or the other party was filled with Wars, especially in <hi>Africa,</hi>
between <hi>Sextus</hi> and <hi>Cornificius,</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi> between <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Dolobella,</hi> and
in <hi>Sicily</hi> against <hi>Pompey,</hi> in which Actions many Cities were forced, as <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,
Tharsus, Rhodes, Patara</hi> and <hi>Xant,</hi> not to speak of others less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable;
the particulars whereof we will relate in the briefest method
possible. The Romans divide <hi>Africa</hi> into two Provinces, of which, they
call that the old which they conquered from the Carthaginians, and that
whereof <hi>Caesar</hi> had newly despoiled King <hi>Iuba</hi> they call the new, that is
<hi>Numidia. Sextius</hi> sent into this last in quality of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Lieutenant, gave
Commands to <hi>Cornificius</hi> to surrender to him the old, because by the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
made among the Triumvirate all <hi>Africa</hi> belonged to <hi>Caesar: Cornificius</hi>
made answer, that he knew nothing of any such Division, and could not
without orders of the Senate quit the Government of a Province they had
given him in charge, whereupon they declared War: <hi>Cornificius</hi> had an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
both better disciplin'd, and stronger in Men than <hi>Sextius,</hi> who having only
light armed Foot made incursions into <hi>Cornificius</hi>'s Government, and dayly
drew some to his Party, till such time as <hi>Ventidius</hi> Lieutenant to <hi>Cornificius</hi>
coming against him with more Forces than he had, besieged him, and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
the other Lieutenant of the same <hi>Cornificius</hi> entred into <hi>Sextius</hi> his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
and besieged <hi>Cirta.</hi> Mean time both Parties sent to demand alliance of
King <hi>Arabion,</hi> and those they call Sittiens, for the reason we are going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.
<hi>Sittius</hi> accused of crimes at <hi>Rome,</hi> not daring stand a trial, fled, and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
together some Forces as well in <hi>Italy</hi> as <hi>Spain,</hi> went over into <hi>Africa.</hi>
There happened then to be War between the African Kings, wherein <hi>Sittius</hi>
taking sometimes one part, and sometimes another, and still carrying Victory
to that side he joyned with, soon gained a fair reputation, and by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
his Army made it capable of great Attempts. He served likewise
<hi>C. Caesar</hi> when he came to make War upon those who took part with <hi>Pompey,</hi>
and slew <hi>Saburra</hi> Lieutenant to King <hi>Iuba,</hi> in acknowledgment of
which services <hi>Caesar</hi> gave him the confiscation of <hi>Manasses</hi>'s Estate, yet not
all of it, but the better part. <hi>Manasses</hi> was Father of this <hi>Arabion,</hi> and for
having assisted King <hi>Iuba, Caesar</hi> divided his Country between <hi>Sittius</hi> and
<hi>Bocchus</hi> King of the Moors. <hi>Sittius</hi> distributed his part to his Soldiers, and
<hi>Arabion</hi> went over into <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Sons. After <hi>Caesar</hi>'s death he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
into <hi>Africa,</hi> from whence he continually sent fresh Troops of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans
to <hi>Sextus</hi> the Son of <hi>Pompey,</hi> who being returned from <hi>Spain</hi> well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced,
he drove out <hi>Bocchus,</hi> and got rid of <hi>Sittius</hi> by treason, and
though he had an inclination for <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Children, because of the good
Offices he had received, yet would he no longer oblige himself to that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
which he saw forsaken by fortune, but chose rather to declare for <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> by whose means he hoped to gain <hi>Caesar</hi>'s favour, and the Sittians in
consideration of his Father's kindness to them, did the same: <hi>Sextius</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by such a reinforcement went and charged <hi>Ventidius,</hi> routs his
People, cuts the most part in pieces, and takes a great many Prisoners. News
whereof being brought to <hi>Lelius,</hi> he raises the Siege of <hi>Cirta,</hi> and returns
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65196:231"/>
to joyn with <hi>Cornificius. Sextius</hi> puffed up with this success, marches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Cornificius,</hi> who lay near <hi>Utica</hi> with much greater Forces; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camps
close by him. There <hi>Lelius</hi> being commanded out with his Horse,
to make discovery of the Posture of the Enemy, <hi>Sextius</hi> gives Order to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabion</hi>
to go charge him in Front with his Horse; and he with his Light-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Foot gains the Flank, whilst he thought to have to deal only with
Horse. He charges him so home, that <hi>Lelius,</hi> before he received farther
disgrace, fearing to be surrounded, and his Retreat cut off, goes and seizes
upon an Eminence in the midst of the Campain; where <hi>Arabion</hi> in his Rear
having slain many of his Horse-men, invests him. <hi>Cornificius</hi> seeing that,
fallies out of the Camp with his best Troops: <hi>Sextius</hi> falls in his Rear: He
faces about; and during the Fight, wherein he is hard put it, <hi>Arabion</hi> sends
privately to his Camp people used to clamber up Rocks; who make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Masters of it. <hi>Roscius,</hi> who had the Guard of it, makes one of his
people kill him. <hi>Cornificius</hi> tired out with fighting, not knowing his Camp
was taken, hastes towards the Eminence to make good his Retreat to <hi>Lelius;</hi>
but <hi>Arabion</hi> getting between him and his mark, he was cut in pieces. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
who beheld all this from the place where he was, kills himself. The
Army seeing their Commanders dead, made every Man the best way he
could. The Proscripts that were with <hi>Cornificius</hi> fled, some to <hi>Sicily,</hi> others
where best they might. <hi>Sextius</hi> gave to <hi>Arabion</hi> and the Sittians great
quantity of Spoils; and pardoning the Cities, received them under the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of <hi>Caesar.</hi> Thus ended the War in <hi>Lybia</hi> between <hi>Sextius</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificius;</hi>
which was thus short, as it seems, by reason of the heat of the
Commanders.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> We will now speak of what was done by <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> after having
made some short Repetition of what has been said before, for the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
the whole. <hi>Caesar</hi> being slain, the Conspirators seized the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol;
from whence they descended after the Senate had proclaimed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity.
Afterward, the people moved for <hi>Caesar</hi>'s death, took Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands
from his Funeral-pile, and clapped them to the Houses of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators;
which defending themselves from above, repulsed the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
and soon after every one of them retired into the Governments which
<hi>Caesar</hi> had given them. <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> exercised still the Office of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
in the City, and had been designed Pro-Pretors by <hi>Caesar; Cassius</hi> of
<hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> of <hi>Macedon.</hi> But because the time appointed for their
going to their Provinces was not yet come, and that without fear they
could not stay in the City. The Senate sent them out honourably, under
pretence of giving them the Superintendence of Provision, lest otherwise
they should seem to have fled. After they were gone the Governments of
<hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Macedon</hi> were given by Decree to the Consuls, <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,</hi>
against the mind of most of the Senate; and yet in some manner to
recompence <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> they granted them <hi>Crete</hi> and <hi>Cyrene:</hi> But
they despising these Governments because they were too small, began by
Money to assure themselves of Forces, with intent to sieze upon <hi>Syria</hi> and
<hi>Macedon.</hi> To this end they were labouring, when <hi>Trebonius</hi> being slain by
<hi>Dolobella,</hi> and <hi>Decimus</hi> besieged in <hi>Gaul</hi> by <hi>Anthony,</hi> the Senate offended,
declared <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Dolobella</hi> Enemies, confirmed <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> in
their first Governments, added <hi>Illyria</hi> to that of <hi>Brutus;</hi> and gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to all Governors, and all Soldiers of the Oriental provinces, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Orders of <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Brutus.</hi> After which <hi>Cassius,</hi> without consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<hi>Dolobella,</hi> advances to possess himself of <hi>Syria,</hi> with the Ensigns of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65196:231"/>
Command, together with twelve compleat Legions of Old Soldiers, who
had served their Apprenticeship under <hi>Caesar.</hi> For <hi>Caesar</hi> having already in
his thoughts the War against the Parthians, had left one in <hi>Syria</hi> under the
Charge of <hi>Cecilius Bassus,</hi> as Lieutenant to <hi>Sextus Iulius,</hi> his Kinsman, yet
very young: who roving about the Country to take his pleasure, used to
carry his Legion along with him, contrary to all Decency: which when
<hi>Bassus</hi> represented unto him, he reviled him. And another time when he
sent for <hi>Bassus,</hi> because he came not immediately, he commanded to bring
him by force: This Command raised a Tumult, and the Tumult a Scuffle,
wherein the Soldiers no longer able to bear with <hi>Iulius</hi> insolence, slew him
with their Javelins: But at the same instant they repented themselves, for
they feared <hi>Caesar;</hi> wherefore they swore mutually to one another, that if
he granted them not a Pardon for this Action, they would defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the death. They likewise forced <hi>Bassus</hi> to be of the Conspiracy;
and raised another Legion, whom they exercised after the Roman way of
Discipline. <hi>Sextus Marcus,</hi> sent by <hi>Caesar</hi> against them with three Legions,
was repulsed; till such time as having called to his Assistance <hi>Minutius Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spus,</hi>
with three other Legions out of <hi>Bithynia, Bassus</hi> found himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
by six Legions, when <hi>Cassius</hi> coming that way, <hi>Bassus</hi> Army volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
submitted to him, and soon after the six Legions commanded by <hi>Marcus</hi>
and <hi>Minutius;</hi> whether they had an inclination for him, or else were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to obey him in compliance with the Senate's Decree. <hi>Allienus</hi> sent
some time before by <hi>Dolobella</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> now brought thence four Legions
of the Remains of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s and <hi>Crassus</hi> Defeats; or of those which <hi>Caesar,</hi>
at his departure from <hi>Egypt,</hi> had left in <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s Service. <hi>Cassius</hi> surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
him in <hi>Palestine,</hi> and forced to take part with him; for he durst not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
eight Legions, having but four. Thus, beyond all expectation, he
found himself Master of twelve Legions, besides a great number of Parthian
Archers on Horse-back, who were come to offer themselves to him out of
the great Esteem he had gained among them, when being Questor to <hi>Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
they judged him more prudent than his General. <hi>Dolobella,</hi> since <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonius</hi>
death, had stayed in <hi>Ionia;</hi> where he exacted great store of Money
from the Cities, and prepared a Fleet of Ships which <hi>Livius Figulus</hi> hired
from the <hi>Rhodians, Lycians, Pamphilians</hi> and <hi>Cilicians.</hi> So that having
made these Preparations, he attempted to seize upon <hi>Syria;</hi> and to that
purpose took his March by Land with two Legions, and gave order to <hi>Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
to follow him by Sea: But when he understood the State of <hi>Cassius</hi> his
Power, he turned into <hi>Laodicea,</hi> a City affectionate to his Interests, and sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate
on a Peninsula fortified to the Land; and whereof the Port was very
commodious to enter with Provisions, or to go out again when ever they
had a mind to set Sail. As soon as <hi>Cassius</hi> had notice hereof, that <hi>Dolobella</hi>
might not escape him, he caused to be raised at the Neck of the Peninsula,
which was two Furlongs over, a Bulwark of the same length, raised with
Stones and other sorts of Materials, which he took from the Houses and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres
that were in the Suburbs. He sent likewise to require Shipping
from the Phenicians, Lycians and Rhodians; who all refused him: But
though only the Sidonians sent theirs to him, he forbore not with them to
assault <hi>Dolobella</hi>'s Navy. There was in this Fight a great many Ships sunk
of one side and the other; nevertheless, at last <hi>Dolobella</hi> got five, with all
the Sea-men and Soldiers in them. <hi>Cassius</hi> sent afresh to demand Aid of
those had refused him at first; and besides them, to <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> Queen of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
and to <hi>Serapion,</hi> who commanded for her in <hi>Cyprus.</hi> The Tyrians,
the Aradians and <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rapion</hi> (without the Queen's Order) sent him all they
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65196:232"/>
had: But the Queen pretended that <hi>Egypt</hi> was afficted with Famine and
Plague to excuse her self; though indeed, for the first <hi>Caesar</hi>'s sake, she was
concerned for <hi>Dolobella,</hi> had already sent him four Legions by <hi>Allienus,</hi>
and had likewise at that present a Fleet in readiness to relieve him, which
only stayed till the foul Weather Season was past. As for the Rhodians and
Lycians, they made Answer, that they would serve neither <hi>Brutus</hi> nor <hi>Cassius</hi>
in a Civil War; and that they had lent their Ships to <hi>Dolobella</hi> for passage
only, not believing he would make use of them in War. After this Answer,
<hi>Cassius,</hi> with those Forces he had, returned to give an Assault to <hi>Dolobella</hi>'s
Fleet; where the advantage was very doubtful at first, but at last <hi>Dolobella</hi>
suffered some loss. At the same time the Bulwark being finished, they
planted Batteries; and whilst they played at the Wall, <hi>Cassius</hi> laboured to
corrupt the Guards: And not being able to gain <hi>Marsus,</hi> who commanded
the Guard by Night, he prevailed with the Centurions that did it by Day;
who, when <hi>Marsus</hi> was gone to his Repose, let in <hi>Cassius</hi> at many little Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterns.
The City being taken, <hi>Dolobella</hi> commanded one of his People to
cut off his Head, and carry it to <hi>Cassius,</hi> to save his own: He obeyed in the
first point, but after killed himself upon his Master's Body: <hi>Marsus</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
slew himself. <hi>Cassius</hi> took an Oath from <hi>Dolobella</hi>'s Army, plundered
the Temples and Treasuries of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> put to death the principal Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
and taxed the rest in vast Summs; so that he reduced the City to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
necessity. From <hi>Laodicea,</hi> he took his March towards <hi>Egypt,</hi> upon
the News that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> was going with a great Fleet to meet <hi>Caesar</hi> and
<hi>Anthony.</hi> He hoped to hinder that Queen's Voyage, and to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of her: and indeed, he was very desirous to have siezed upon <hi>Egypt,</hi>
then oppressed with Famine, and disfurnished of Men of War, <hi>Alienus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
lately drawn thence the four Legions. And it is probable something
might have been done, but <hi>Brutus</hi> sent for <hi>Cassius</hi> in haste, because <hi>Caesar</hi> and
<hi>Anthony</hi> had passed the Ionian Sea. Thus <hi>Cassius</hi> diverted from the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of which he had great hopes, dismissed the Parthians with
Rewards, and sent Ambassadors to their King, to demand a greater Succor;
which arriving after the Defeat, over-run <hi>Syria</hi> and the Neighbouring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
as far as <hi>Ionia,</hi> and so returned. After this, having left his Nephew
in <hi>Syria</hi> with one Legion, he sent his Horse before into <hi>Cappadocia;</hi> surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<hi>Ariobarzanes,</hi> under pretence that he had deserted <hi>Cassius,</hi> and defeated
him; and brought to the General all his Treasures and Provisions which he
had made ready for the War. Those of <hi>Tarsus</hi> being divided into two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
the one had first received <hi>Cassius,</hi> and made him a Present of a
Crown; the other some time after payed the same Honours to <hi>Dolobella;</hi>
and both acted in the Name of the Community: So that by having receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sometimes one and sometimes the other, they exposed their City to be
punished by both for their Inconstancy; and at last <hi>Cassius,</hi> after <hi>Dolobella</hi>'s
death, taxed them in fifteen hundred Talents. They were already so poor,
that they had not wherewithal to pay this Summ; but the Soldiers tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them with a thousand Cruelties to make them find it: They sold first
all the Publick Goods; then things consecrated, even to the Ornaments of
the Temples, and the Offerings had been made: Which yet amounting not
to the least part of the Summ, the Magistrates sold the Free Persons; first
the Maids and Children, then the Women and Old Men, who yielded but
little; and after all, the Young Men, many of which slew themselves. At

was of Opinion they should go into <hi>Macedon,</hi> and give Battel to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
who had forty Legions; eight of which had already passed the Ioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Sea. <hi>Cassius</hi> judged on the contrary; that the Enemy being so nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
were not to be dreaded, seeing they would scatter of themselves for
want of Provisions; and therefore, that it were better to begin the War
with the Rhodians and Lycians, who held for the Enemies, and were very
strong in Shipping, lest they should fall into their Rear whilst they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
with <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony.</hi> This Opinion was followed; <hi>Brutus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
the Lycians, and <hi>Cassius</hi> those of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> where he had been educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and had studied those Sciences taught in <hi>Greece.</hi> And because he had
to deal with People very expert in Sea-Fights, he fitted up all the Ships he
had, manned them both with Sea-Men and Soldiers, and exercised them at
<hi>Mynda.</hi> As for the Rhodians, the most prudent of them were fearful to
come to Extremities with the Romans; but the People made insolent with
those Victories, which they remembred to have gained against People, to
whom the Romans were no ways comparable, were very glad of it; and
began to set in order three and thirty of the best Vessels they had. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
they sent Deputies to <hi>Cassius</hi> to desire him not to contemn <hi>Rhodes,</hi>
which had always revenged it self on those that had despised them: Nor to
violate the Treaties between the Romans and the Rhodians, by which they
had promised not to bear Arms one against the other. That if he found
fault with them for refusing their Ships, they would send Deputies to the
Senate; and if the Senate ordered it, they would assist him with all their
Forces. To this <hi>Cassius</hi> made Answer, that now it was no more time to
make use of Words, but Arms: That as for those Treaties which obliged
them not to bear Arms one against another, they had first violated them by
assisting <hi>Dolob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lla</hi> against him: That the same Treaties contained likewise a
Promise of assisting one the other; and that when <hi>Cassius</hi> demanded theirs,
they mocked him with a pretence of sending Deputies to the Senate, now
dispersed into all parts in their flight from those Tyrants had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Lords of the City; Tyrants which he would punish as well as the
Rhodians their Abettors, if they did not suddenly submit themselves. This
Answer increased the fear of the Wise Men: But the People suffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be led by <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Mnaseus;</hi> who encouraged them by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them in mind how <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and before him <hi>Demetrius,</hi> had in vain
attempted <hi>Rhodes</hi> with far greater numbers of Shipping. Wherefore they
made <hi>Alexander</hi> Prytane, which is the chief and most powerful Magistrate
of the City; and <hi>Mnaseus</hi> they made Admiral. However, they again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to <hi>Cassius, Archelaus,</hi> under whom he had studied the Greek Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
who, as one that had lived familiarly with him, taking him by the
hand, spoke thus.</p>

                           <p>WIll you that love the Greeks, ruin a Greek City; and that fight for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
take it from <hi>Rhodes</hi> that is a Free City? Are you envious of
the Glory of the Dorick Nation, which never yet was overcome; or have you
forgot those Noble Stories you learnt at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and at <hi>Rome</hi> it self? At
<hi>Rhodes</hi> the mighty Actions the Rhodians, when assaulted in their City, have
done against a number of Kings; and above all, against those were thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible,
<hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Mithridates,</hi> for the Defence of that Liberty for
which you say you are now in Arms? At <hi>Rome,</hi> the important Services we
have done the Romans, especially against King <hi>Antiochus;</hi> the Monuments of
which you may there behold engraven in Copper? This I say to oblige you to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our Nation, the Honour of our City, its good Fortune which never yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
it, its Affection to the Romans, and the Assistance it has offered them.
But as to what may concern your self, <hi>Cassius;</hi> you ought particularly to bear
some respect to a City wherein you have been educated, taught, cured of your Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and where you have a long time sojourned, and that even in my School;
which makes me hope that the pains I have formerly took in instructing you, will
not prove unprofitable to my Country, in dispensing her from engaging in a War
with her Nursling and Scholar; wherein of two things, one must be inevitable;
all the Rhodians must perish, or <hi>Cassius</hi> must be overcome. I will add a little
Counsel to the Request I make you. In the important Affair wherein you are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
for the Publick Good, take the Gods for the Guide of all your Actions;
those Gods by which you swore, when by <hi>Caesar</hi>'s intermission we last renewed the
Alliance between <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                              </gap>; and after we had sworn mutually, gave hands in token of
that Faith which ought to be kept, even to Enemies; but with much more reason
to Friends, and those from whom we have received our Education. Besides, we
ought not only to consider the Gods, but also take care to preserve our Reputation
for the sake of Men; for those who violate Treaties are abhorred of all the
World; and after having once broke it, neither Friends nor Enemies have any
more Relyance on their Word.</p>

                           <p>IF you disswaded not the Rhodians from affronting me, you have affronted me
your self; and if you told them your thoughts, because they did not believe
you, I will revenge you. Now, it is manifest they have affronted me, first in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing
that Assistance I demanded, in which they have despised me; Me that
have been bred and educated in their City. Secondly, In preferring <hi>Dolobella</hi>
before me, who was neither fed nor bred there: And what is yet more odious;
whilst <hi>Brutus,</hi> and I, and all the rest of the Senators that fly from Tyranny, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:65196:233"/>
as you see to restore our Country to Liberty; and that <hi>Dolobella</hi> and others,
whose Party you favour, oppress it. You, Gentlemen of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> that are such
mighty Lovers of Liberty, you make a pretence that you will not concern your
selves in our Civil Wars; though this be no Civil War, since we pretend not
to the Sovereignty. It is a declared War against Tyrants, and the Republick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
your Assistance; you decline it by desiring to be left in Liberty, under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
that you have Alliance with the Romans, and yet have no compassion for so
many Romans unjustly condemned to death, and proscribed, with Confiscation of
their Goods; feigning that you expect the Orders of the Senate, now so oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that it is in no power of defending it self: Yet it is a long time since you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
those Orders by Decree, commanding all the Oriental Provinces to obey
<hi>Brutus</hi> and I. As for you, <hi>Archelaus,</hi> you set a great value upon the Services
the Rhodians have done us in the increase of our Empire, and of which you have
received ample Recompence: But you say nothing to what you owe to our Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
now that we fight for Liberty and the Safety of our Country; though the
Dorians, had we never had any Commerce together, ought to gain the Romans
Friendship, defend from Oppression the Roman Commonwealth. If without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering any of these Reasons, you stand upon the terms of Alliance made between
us by <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> the Founder of the Tyranny; it expresly says that the People
of <hi>Rome</hi> and the People of <hi>Rhodes</hi> shall assist one the other in necessity. Assist
therefore the Romans in the Extremity wherein they now are; <hi>Cassius</hi> sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
you to it according to the terms of the Treaty: He is a Roman, and
Commander over the Romans, authorized by Decree, which commands all the
People of the East to receive his Orders: <hi>Brutus</hi> requires the Execution of the
same Decree; and <hi>Pompey</hi> too, appointed by the Senate to the Superintendence
of Sea Affairs. Add to these the Prayers of all the Senators who are escaped,
part to <hi>Brutus</hi> and me, and part to <hi>Pompey;</hi> though by the Treaty the
Rhodians are to help any single Roman that calls to them for Aid. But if you
take not us either for Pretors, or so much as for Romans; but treat us like
Strangers or Fugitives, or as the Tyrants call us, for condemned Men; you
have indeed no Alliance with us, but with the People of <hi>Rome:</hi> But we Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that are not comprehended in this Treaty, will make War upon you till you
pay us an absolute Submission.</p>

               <p>After this Answer <hi>Cassius</hi> dismissed <hi>Archelaus</hi> with much Civility: And
after his Return <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Mnaseus,</hi> the Commanders of the Rhodians
went to <hi>Myndus</hi> with their three and thirty Ships, to out-brave <hi>Cassius;</hi> and
it may be too, they had some hopes of Victory, the remembrance how
they dealt with <hi>Mithridates</hi> near this place begetting thoughts in them that
they might now likewise come off with success. The first day they were
satisfied with shewing their skill at the Oar, and so returned to <hi>Gnidus:</hi>
The next day they came again resolved to fall upon <hi>Cassius</hi> Fleet: The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
wondring at their boldness, weighed, and went to meet them; and
now they fought bravely on both sides. The Rhodians by nimble rowing
hither and thither, with their lighter Vessels charged the Romans some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the Bow, and sometimes on the Broad-side; but when the Romans
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ould grapple with them, they fought with them hand to hand, as if upon
firm Ground. At last, <hi>Cassius</hi> having a greater number of Ships than the
Enemy, surrounded them in that manner, that they could no more turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
in that nimble manner as before; but if charging the Romans a Head,
they went presently off again, they must needs come to dammage, being
closely blocked up: And the Rhodian Prows not being able to pierce the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65196:234"/>
strong built Roman Ships, whereas the Roman gave shrewd shocks when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they joyned Board and Board to the lighter Rhodians. So that at last
they had three Ships taken with all their Gang, and two sunk; the rest esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> but in an ill condition; and the Romans retreated to <hi>Myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi>
where they refitted several of their Ships that had come to dammage.
Such was the Success of the Sea-fight between the Romans and Rhodians
near <hi>Myndus;</hi> where <hi>Cassius</hi> was not in person, but beheld it from the top
of a Hill. After he had refitted his Ships, he came to <hi>Loryma,</hi> a Fort stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon the Continent, but by the Sea side, and belonging to the Rhodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
From hence he transported his Land Army, commanded by <hi>Fanius</hi>
and <hi>Lentulus,</hi> upon Ships of Burthen into the Island; and himself with
fourscore Galleys, went and anchored near the City, besieged now by Sea
and Land; where he for some time remained without doing any thing, in
hopes the Enemy would submit: But they charged him as fiercely as at
first; and again with the loss of two Ships, found themselves invested on
all sides. The Walls were immediately lined round with Soldiers, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themselves from <hi>Fanius,</hi> who at the same time stormed the City by
Land; and from <hi>Cassius,</hi> who approached with his Fleet and all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessry for an Attack. For foreseeing he should stand in need of them, he
had brought along Towers of Wood ready framed; which were soon set
together and mounted. Thus <hi>Rhodes,</hi> after the ill success of two Fights,
was beleagured by Sea and Land; unprepared to sustain a Storm, as is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
in unexpected Surprizes; so that in all likelihood the Enemy would in
a short time become Master of it, either by Force or Famine. The most
prudent of the Inhabitants had no doubt of it; and were already capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with <hi>Fanius</hi> and <hi>Lentulus,</hi> when they were all astonished to see <hi>Cassius</hi>
with the choicest of his Forces in the midst of the City, without perceiving
any Violence, or that he had made use of any Scaling Ladders. Many
thought, and not without reason, that some of his Friends in the City had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
him the Wickets to save it from Plunder, or before it should be forced
yield for want of Provisions. <hi>Rhodes</hi> being thus taken, <hi>Cassius</hi> seated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in a Tribunal, upon which was fixed a Spear, as if he had taken the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by Force: and having drawn up his Army to a stand, he published a
Proclamation forbidding the Soldiers to plunder or commit any violence
upon pain of death. After which he called by name about fifty of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> whom he put to death; and five and twenty others which
absented themselves, he condemned to Banishment. In conclusion, he
spoiled all the Temples, and all the Publick Places of all the Riches, and of
all the Gold and Silver which he could find; and moreover, commanded
every particular Person to bring in all he had at a prefixed day; with
threats to put to death those that concealed any thing, and promise to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Informer with the tenth Penny if he were Free, and with Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
if he were a Slave. At first many ventured upon Concealments, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
the threats would not be executed with severity; but when they
saw the Reward given to the Informers, they grew fearful, and requested
that the time might be prolonged; which being granted, some dug up
their Money from under Ground, others drew it up out of Wells, others
out of Sepulchres; so that they brought much greater quantities than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
To such calamity was the City of <hi>Rhodes</hi> reduced, in which <hi>Lucius
Varus</hi> was left Governor. <hi>Cassius</hi> extraordinarily well satisfied to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it in so short a time, and to get withal so much Money, gave Command
to all the other Provinces to pay him in ten Years Tribute; which was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
performed. Mean time a report was brought that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> with a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:65196:234"/>
mighty Fleet, and great Warlike Preparations were at Sea to go joyn <hi>Caesar</hi>
and <hi>Anthony:</hi> for having formerly underhand favoured their Party for old
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s sake, she now openly declared her self for the fear she stood in of
<hi>Cassius.</hi> Wherefore he caused <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rcus</hi> to embark with the best Legion he
had, and some Archers; and in sixty Ships sent him to <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> giving
him Order to post himself about <hi>Tenarus;</hi> from whence himself had taken
off all the Cattel and other Provisions in the Peninsula.</p>
               <p>We will now relate the Exploits of <hi>Brutus</hi> in <hi>Lycia:</hi> But here it will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/>
be necessary to look a little back, the better to revive the remembrance
of things. After that he had received from <hi>Apuleius</hi> those Forces he had,
with sixteen thousand Talents; and gathered in the Tributes of <hi>Asia,</hi> he
came to <hi>Baeotia:</hi> Where the Senate having given him order to employ this
Money for his present Necessities, with the Command of the Armies in
<hi>Macedon</hi> and <hi>Illyria; Ventidius,</hi> his Predecessor in the Government of this
last Province, delivered up to him three Legions, whereof the Illyrian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was composed. He took at the same time one from <hi>Caius, Anthony</hi>'s
Brother, whom he found in his Government; and after raised four Legions
more of new Troops. All which together, made eight Legions; among
which were many of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Veterans, and great numbers of Macedonians,
whom he caused to be exercised in the Roman Discipline: And all this
without comprizing his Horse, which were in no small numbers; and his
Light-armed Foot, and Archers. Whilst he was endeavouring to raise Men,
and gather up Money, there appeared an Adventure to him from part of
<hi>Thrace.</hi> A King of that Country being slain by his Enemies, <hi>Polemocratia</hi>
his Widdow, who was fearful for her Son, came to <hi>Brutus;</hi> recommending
her Infant to him, and delivering into his hands the Treasures of her dead
Husband. He sent the Infant to the Cyzicenians, to take care of him till he
had leisure to go and restore him to his Kingdom: But finding in those
Treasures a prodigious quantity of Gold and Silver, he caused it to be coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into Mony. When at the Conference with <hi>Cassius</hi> they had agreed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that before all other things they would make War upon the Lycians
and the Rhodians; he undertook to fall upon the Lycians, by the Siege of
the City of <hi>Xanthus.</hi> The Inhabitants pulled down their Suburbs, lest <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
should lodge in them, or out of them furnish themselves with Materials
for the Seige: And fortifying their City, defended themselves by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of a Ditch fifty Foot deep, and proportionably broad; in so much that
those on either side could do each other no hurt, unless with Slings or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows;
for they stood as if parted by a deep River. <hi>Brutus</hi> resolving to fill
this Ditch, caused Mantelets to be made to secure his Men's Approach, and
divided the Work by night and day amongst the whole Army; beginning
to labour in good earnest, causing Materials to be with all speed brought
from far, and omitting no care or diligence necessary on such an occasion.
In short, though at first it seemed likely that either the Enemies would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Work; or, at least, that it would take up some Months time; yet
it was finished in few days, and <hi>Brutus</hi> found himself at the Foot of the
Wall; where he caused his Machines to be raised, and the Gates stormed by
his Foot, continually releived by fresh Companies sent one after another.
Yet for all this did the Besieged, though almost all tired out, and the most
wounded, defend themselves as long as their Walls stood. There was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
some Breaches made, and their Towers were all shattered; when
<hi>Brutus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> well foreseeing what would happen, gave over the Storm at the
Gates, and caused his Men to retreat from the Assault. Whereupon, the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65196:235"/>
Inhabitants imagining this Retreat proceeded from the Negligence or
Cowardise of the Besiegers, made a Sally by night upon their Enemies with
Torches in their hands. The Romans, who expected them, running in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, they took their flight towards the Gates, which those that had
the Guard of shut, for fear lest their Enemies should enter with them; so
that there happened a great Slaughter. Some time after those that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the City sallyed out at Noon day; and having beaten off the Guards,
fired all the Machines. The Gates being left open because of the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
that happened before, there entred with the Inhabitants about two
thousand Romans; and as the rest were thronging in after them, the Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullis
all on a suddain fell upon them; whether by order of the Xanthians,
or that the Ropes that held them broke. Thus of the Romans that had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
themselves too far, some were lost, and the rest found themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed,
not being able to lift up the Portcullis for want of Cordage: so that
knocked down from above by the Xanthians in those narrow Streets, they
with much difficulty gained the Publick Place, which was not far off;
where still extremely tormented with the Arrows shot at them: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
neither Bows nor Arrows, they retreated into the Temple of <hi>Sarpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
for fear of being at last over-pressed by the multitude. Mean while the
Romans troubled, and fearful for those shut within the City, attempted all
ways possible to relieve them: And <hi>Brutus</hi> went from Quarter to Quarter,
to encourage his Soldiers; but they could not break open the Gates, almost
covered over with Bars of Iron; and their Ladders and Towers of Wood
were burnt. Notwithstanding, some applyed themselves to make new
Ladders; others raised Perches, Forks and other pieces of Timber against
the Walls to serve instead of Ladders; others fastned Iron Hooks upon
Ropes, cast them over the Battlements; and when they catched hold, climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up by help of the Rope. The Oenandes, Neighbours and Enemies to
the Xanthians; and therefore now serving under <hi>Brutus,</hi> began to scramble
up the Rocks and Precipices, where the Romans with much pain followed
them; and though many tumbled back, yet some gained the Wall, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
a little Gate, before which was a Palisade of very sharp Stakes; over
which some of the bravest, assisted by those already within, passed: So that
now being a considerable number, they attempted to break open a great
Gate, which was not on the inside lined with Bars of Iron; to which effect
those without laboured likewise. The Xanthians were at the same time
fighting with those shut up in the Temple of <hi>Sarpedon,</hi> who made a great
noise; which made those who both within and without were endeavouring
to break open the Gate to make one great push for all; which effecting their
business, they about Sun-set entred pell mell into the Town, shouting out as
loud as they could, that those in the Temple might hear them. The City
being taken, the Inhabitants retreated to their Houses; where they slew all
those they loved best, who of themselves came to offer themselves up to
death. <hi>Brutus</hi> hearing the cries and groans which this fury caused through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the City, thought the Soldiers had been plundering; and by Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
forbad it: Bnt when he understood the true cause, he had compassion
of People so fond of their Liberty, and sent to offer them Composition: but
they with Darts and Arrows drove back those that came to speak with them;
and after having slain all their Domesticks, and layd their Bodies upon
Piles, they set them on fire; and then slaying themselves, they burnt with
the rest. <hi>Brutus</hi> preserved from the flame all the Temples he could, and
took Prisoners only a few Slaves, and about one hundred and fifty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Virgins
and Women who had no Men to kill them. And this was the third time
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:65196:235"/>
the Xanthians were destroyed for defence of their Liberty: for being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
besieged by <hi>Harpalus</hi> the Median, Lieutenant to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> they chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to die than yield, and their City served them for a common Tomb;
which <hi>Harpalus</hi> put not himself to the trouble to hinder. And under <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander,</hi>
the Son of <hi>Philip,</hi> they fell under the like misfortune; refusing to
submit to that Conqueror of so many Nations.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Panthus, Brutus</hi> went down to <hi>Patara,</hi> which seemed to be the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/>
Port of the Xanthians; invested the City, summoned the Inhabitants to
surrender, under the penalty of being treated like their Neighbours: And
the better to perswade them, brought before them Prisoners of <hi>Xanthus;</hi>
who making a Recital of their Misery, exhorted them to be wiser. The
Patarans making no Answer, <hi>Brutus</hi> gave them the rest of that day to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of it, and retreated. The next morning he returned before the
place; when the Inhabitants cryed out from the Walls, that they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to follow his Orders, and opened to him the Gates. Being entred, he
neither put to death nor banished Person, but caused be brought to him all
the Publick Mony of the City; and commanded likewise every particular
person to bring in what he had, under the same Penalties and the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
as <hi>Cassius,</hi> after the taking of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> had decreed to the Concealers
and Informers: which was exercised so punctually, that there was not a
Concealer, save one who was accused by his Slave. After this Traytor
had shewed to the Centurion that was sent, the place where the Mony was
hid, as they carried away all the Family before <hi>Brutus,</hi> the Master said not
a word; but his Mother followed crying out, to save his life, that it was
she that had hid it. Upon which the Slave, without being asked, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the Mother lyed, for that it was her Son himself had hid it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
praising the Son's silence and the Mother's affection to her Son, sent
them away with their Mony without any Punishment; but for the Slave
that would have destroyed both Master and Mistress, he caused him to be
hanged. At the same time <hi>Lentulus</hi> sent to <hi>Andriac,</hi> which is a Port of the
Myrians, broke the Chain which crossed over the Port; went up to <hi>Mira,</hi>
which was surrendred to him by the Inhabitants; and after having taken
their Mony, as was done at <hi>Patara,</hi> returned to <hi>Brutus:</hi> whither came
the Lycian Deputies, promising him to serve him and assist him to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of their power. He imposed on them a certain Tribute, sent back to
<hi>Xanthus</hi> all the Free People, gave order to the Lycian People to meet him
at <hi>Abydos;</hi> whither having sent his own Ships, he marched himself by
Land, there to wait for <hi>Cassius,</hi> who was to come from <hi>Ionia,</hi> that they
might together pass over to <hi>Sestos.</hi> Mean while <hi>Murcus,</hi> who had posted
himself about <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> with design to engage Queen <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s Fleet if
she passed that way; understanding that she had been driven by Storms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Coasts of <hi>Lybia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and that some of her Wracks were brought as far
as <hi>Lacedemon;</hi> she her self being surprized by Sickness, being forced to
make her Retreat into <hi>Egypt;</hi> he, that he might not lose time, and do nothing
with so great a number of Ships, crossed over to <hi>Brundusium;</hi> where he seiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Island that makes a part of the Harbor; from whence he hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the Remainder of the Enemy's from being transported over into <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi>
or Provisions to be carried to those were there. But <hi>Anthony</hi> besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with those few long Ships he had; raising to this purpose Towers
upon Rafts of Timber, whilst he made his Companies, one after another,
go aboard the Ships of Burthen, and taking the opportunity of the
Wind off Shore (for fear of being surprized in their passage by <hi>Murcus</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:65196:236"/>
Fleet) put out to Sea. Yet he found that this Seige would prove very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
wherefore he called <hi>Caesar</hi> to his Assistance, who was now fighting
with <hi>Pompey,</hi> on the Sicilian Sea for <hi>Sicily</hi> it self. But it is necessary that I
say something of this <hi>Pompey,</hi> the youngest of the Children of the great
<hi>Pompey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIV"/> After that his Brother was killed in <hi>Spain, Caesar</hi> despised him as a young
Man, unexperienced and incapable of attempting any great matter: and
indeed, he was retreated towards the Ocean, at the Head of a few High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-Men,
with whom he rambled the Country, not known to be <hi>Pompey.</hi>
But at last a greater number of Vagabonds joyning with him, seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
Commander of pretty considerable Forces; and declaring himself for
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s Son, all the Soldiers who had served under his Father or under
his Brother, and had neither Employ nor certain Residence, came to him
as to their General. <hi>Arabion</hi> likewise came from <hi>Africa</hi> after having been
expelled his Father's Estates, as we have heretofore said. The name of
<hi>Pompey</hi> soon spread it self through all <hi>Spain,</hi> the greatest of the Roman Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces:
And he shewed himself sometimes in one place, sometimes in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
yet not daring to adventure a Battel with <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Lieutenants. When
all these things were known at <hi>Rome, C. Caesar</hi> sent <hi>Carinas</hi> and greater For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to defeat <hi>Pompey:</hi> But he with his flying Army fell upon <hi>Carinas</hi> when
least looked for, and then made his Retreat to places of Security; for he
had already got some Towns, both small and great. Wherefore <hi>Caesar</hi>
sent to succed <hi>Carinas, Asinius Pollio;</hi> who made no farther Advances than
his Predecessor had done: And <hi>Caesar</hi> being dead, the Senate recalled <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey;</hi>
who came thereupon to <hi>Marsilia,</hi> to attend what course the Affairs of
the City would take. Afterwards the Superintendence of Sea-Affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given to him, with the same Power that formerly his Father had; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of returning to the City, he went and gathered together such Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
as he found in several Ports; and with a considerable Fleet set Sail
from <hi>Spain.</hi> At the beginning of the Triumvate he landed in <hi>Sicily;</hi> where
<hi>Bithynicus,</hi> who was Governor, refusing to surrender to him the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he besieged him in the Isle; till such time as <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Phanius,</hi>
Proscripts, who escaped, perswaded <hi>Bithynicus</hi> to yield to <hi>Pompey.</hi> Thus
he soon beheld himself extremely powerful in <hi>Sicily;</hi> Master of a great
number of Ships, of an Island commodious for <hi>Italy,</hi> and of a mighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
composed as well of the People he had at first, as those which the
Proscripts brought him, Free Men and Slaves, or which came to him from
those Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> decreed by the Triumvirs for a Reward of their Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
after the Victory; for the Inhabitants of those Cities abhorred nothing
more than the name of that Victory. Wherefore, they secretly opposed it
all they could possible; forsaking their Country, which they now held
no more for their Country; and retreating to <hi>Pompey,</hi> who was their
Neighbour, and now in the esteem of all the World. Besides, he had Sea-men,
Africans and Spaniards, very expert Men; so that he wanted neither
Officers, nor Soldiers, nor Ships, nor Mony. <hi>Caesar</hi> having notice of these
things, sent away <hi>Salvidienus</hi> with his Fleet, to go drive <hi>Pompey</hi> out of <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
as if it had been an easie thing; and himself followed with his Land-Army
through <hi>Italy,</hi> to <hi>Rhegium,</hi> where he had ordered the Navy to meet
him. But <hi>Pompey</hi> met <hi>Salvidienus</hi> with a great Fleet, and engaged him in
the Entrance of the Streights, near <hi>Scylla. Pompey</hi>'s Ships were the nimbl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and his Sea-men the most skilful; whereas the Roman Vessels were
heavy, and therefore not so yare in working: Besides, the Sea, which was
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:65196:236"/>
very boysterous in the place where they fought, was less troublesome to
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s Sea-men, who were used to it, than to <hi>Salvidienus</hi>'s, who perhaps
had never past that Strait; and therefore were not able to keep any sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
course, for they could neither row nor stere. Towards Evening <hi>Salvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dienus</hi>
first retreated, and <hi>Pompey</hi> drew off soon after. The loss of Ships
was equal: <hi>Salvidienus</hi> refitted his Ships in a Port called <hi>Balara,</hi> nigh unto
the place where they fought, and whither he at first retired; and <hi>Caesar</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
arrived in those Quarters, gave his promise to those of <hi>Rhegium</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi>
that he would except their Cities from the number of those which
were to be given in reward to his Soldiers; which they were forely afraid
of, because they lay so nigh the Strait of <hi>Sicily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thereupon, <hi>Anthony</hi> having sent in haste for him, he embarked for <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dusium;</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/>
leaving <hi>Sicily</hi> on the Right Hand, and referring to another Season
the reducing of that Island, and the War against <hi>Pompey. Murcus</hi> having
intelligence of his coming, that he might not be surrounded by <hi>Caesar</hi>'s and
<hi>Anthony</hi>'s Powers, at once quitted <hi>Brundusium,</hi> to go and watch in their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
for those Ships of Burthen that carried the Enemy's Army to <hi>Macedon.</hi>
They were convoyed by Gallies; but the fair Wind contributed more to
their Security than their Convoy. <hi>Murcus</hi> troubled to see his hopes frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
watched once more to surprize them as they returned empty; but both
then, and afterwards, when they were loaden again with more Forces, they
escaped him with full Sails, till the whole Army, together with <hi>Caesar</hi> and
<hi>Anthony,</hi> were got over. Though <hi>Murcus</hi> believed Fortune opposite to his
designs, yet he stayed still in his Post to hinder, as much as in him lay, the
transportation of Ammunitions, Provisions, or the new raised Forces. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as to a convenient place, came to joyn Forces with him <hi>Domitius Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobarbus,</hi>
sent by <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> with fifty other Ships, one Legion, and
some Archers: For because the Enemy could have but small store of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
elsewhere, they thought it a matter of importance to hinder the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
of any out of <hi>Italy:</hi> And indeed, <hi>Murcus</hi> and <hi>Aenobarbus</hi> with
one hundred and thirty long Ships or Gallies, a great number of smaller
Vessels, and a considerable Army, did very much annoy <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
by guarding this Passage. Mean while <hi>Ceditius</hi> and <hi>Norbanus,</hi> whom
the Triumvirs had sent before into <hi>Macedon</hi> with eight Legions; having
from <hi>Macedon,</hi> advanced by way of the Mountains, towards <hi>Thrace;</hi> after
fifteen hundred Furlongs March, were got beyond the <hi>Philippi</hi>'s, and went
and seized upon the Strait of <hi>Torpides</hi> and <hi>Salapaees,</hi> in the Estates of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scupolis,</hi>
which were then the only known Passages from <hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>Asia.</hi>
And this was the first stop that presented it self to <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> who
were crossed over from <hi>Abidos</hi> to <hi>Sestos.</hi> This <hi>Rascupolis</hi> and <hi>Rascus,</hi> his
Brother, Princes of the Blood-Royal of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and Sovereigns of a certain
Country, were of different Parties; and with a thousand Horse each, <hi>Ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
held for <hi>Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Rascupolis</hi> for <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius.</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> informed themselves of the Ways, <hi>Rascupolis</hi> told
them that the Ways of <hi>Aena</hi> and <hi>Maronia</hi> were the greatest Road, and the
shortest and most ordinary Way to go to the Straits of <hi>Salapees,</hi> the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
by the Enemies; and that to fetch a turn about the March would be
thrice as long, and very difficult. Upon this Advice, they judging that
the Enemy had not seized upon the Post, so much to cut off their passage,
as that thereby they might have the greater conveniency of forraging and
fetching Provisions out of <hi>Thrace</hi> than <hi>Macedon,</hi> they set forward on the
way of <hi>Aena</hi> and <hi>Maronia,</hi> and from thence went to <hi>Lysimachia</hi> and <hi>Cardia,</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:65196:237"/>
which serve as Gates to the Neck of the Thracian <hi>Chersonesus,</hi> from whence
the next day they came to the Black Gulf. Here they mustered their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and found they had nineteen Legions, nine for <hi>Cassius,</hi> and eight for
<hi>Brutus,</hi> which were not quite full, and two which they distributed into the
others to make them complete, so that the whole amounted to about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
thousand Foot; as for Cavalry <hi>Brutus</hi> had four thousand Gaul and
<note n="*" place="margin">Portugals.</note> Lusitanian Horse, and two thousand Thracians, Illyrians, Parthians and
Thessalians, and <hi>Cassius</hi> had two thousand Spaniards and Gauls, and four
thousand Archers on Horseback, Arabians, Medes and Parthians, besides
the Kings and Tetrarchs of the Galatians in <hi>Asia,</hi> who brought with them
good store of Foot, and five thousand Horse. These were the Forces <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
and <hi>Cassius</hi> had at the Black Gulf, and with which they fought the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
the remainder of their Forces being employed upon other Affairs.
The Army being here purged with the usual Ceremonies, they payed what
they had promised to those who had not yet received it; for they had taken
a course not to want Money, because indeed they stood in need of it, to
gain by force of gifts the hearts of the Soldiers, and especially of the Vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans
who had born Arms under <hi>C. Caesar,</hi> for fear left at the fight or name of
his Son they should change their minds. Besides they thought it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
the Army should be spoke too; and at the same time caused to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
a great Tribunal, whereon the Generals with the Senators
only being mounted, and all the Army as well their own Forces
as the Auxiliaries, drawn round about them, they took great delight
to view one another. The Commanders began to take heart, and to hope
well in the great number of their Soldiers, and the Soldiers began to grow
in love with their Commanders; for there is nothing unites hearts so
much as common hopes. Now because there was a great noise made by so
vast a multitude, silence was commanded by sound of the Trumpet, and
then <hi>Cassius,</hi> who was the elder of the two, advancing somewhat out of
his place, spoke in this manner:</p>
               <q>
                  <floatingText xml:lang="unk">

                              <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> THat danger which is common to us, Fellow Soldiers, obliges us to
be faithful one to another, besides that you are farther engaged
by receiving the Donative we had promised you, which ought to beget
a belief in you that we will keep our words with you for the future, and
you ought to hope for a happy success of this War from your own va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
from our Conduct, and from the Generosity of these great Men of
the Senate, whom you see here sitting. We have as you well know
great store of Munitions, Provisions, Arms, Money, Ships, and many
Provinces and Kingdoms, which declare for us. Wherefore we need not
make use of words to exhort to resolution and concord those whom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
defence and interest obliges. As for the Calumnies which our two
Enemies cast upon us, you know them, and 'tis that knowledge binds
you so firmly to our Party: yet I shall be well content to give you this
day an account of our Actions, that you may the more clearly understand,
never was any War more honest and just than this we are now going up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
By serving with you under <hi>Caesar</hi> in many Wars, in some of which
we likewise commanded, we contributed to his Greatness, and therefore
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:65196:237"/>
were always his Friends, that no Man may think we attempted his life
out of any particular grudge. Peace being made, as he was Criminal, he
ought to have been accused, not by us who were his Friends, and whom
he had raised to Honours in the City, but by the Laws, and by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth;
but because neither the Laws, nor the Determinations of
the Senate, nor the Decrees of the People were now any more of any
account, but he had thrown down all those things instituted by our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers,
when they expelled Kings, and swore never again to suffer the
Regal Power, we being their Successors have prevented the violation
of their Oath, we have diverted from our selves, and cast off from our
own Heads those imprecations they pronounced, by not suffering one
Man, though so much our Friend and Benefactor, to be longer Master of
the Treasures and Forces of the Republick, or have the dispose of all
Dignities and Governments, to the shame of the Senate and Roman Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
or in short, change the Laws according to his fancy, usurping over
the People and Senate and absolute power and Sovereign Authority; pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
in those times you did not make sufficient reflections on these things,
but regarded only in him the quality of Generalissimo. But now you may
better understand what I say, by what particularly concerns you; you
are of the People, during War you obey your General, and in Peace
have the right of giving your vote. The Senate first deliberates all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
that you may not be deceived, but it is you, who in your Assemblies,
either by Tribes or Centuries create Consuls, Tribunes of the People,
Pretors, who give Sovereign Sentences, and decree to us either Rewards
or Punishments, according as we have well or ill behaved our selves in
our Charges. Thus for giving to every Man according to his desert, our
Empire owes to you its felicity; and when you distribute honours to those
deserve them, they have likewise to you a particular obligation. 'Twas
by this very power you made <hi>Scipio</hi> Consul, to whom in testimony of his
valour you gave the sirname of <hi>African,</hi> by this you created annual Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
of the People, who had power to oppose the Senate, when it was
necessary for your advantage. But what need I relate things, your selves
so well know. Since <hi>Caesar</hi> made himself Master of the Common-wealth,
you have not by your Votes nominated any Magistrate, neither Pretor,
nor Consul, nor Tribune of the People, you have given no person a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
of his Virtue, nor have had the power to grant him any reward.
In short, no person is obliged to you, neither for his Government, nor
for Judgment given in his behalf; and what is yet more worthy of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,
you have not been able to secure from outrage the Tribunes of
the People, who are your particular Magistrates, and whom by your
Decree you have declared sacred and inviolable. But those inviolable
persons you have beheld infamously degraded from a sacred Dignity,
devested of a sacred Habit, without any legal trial, by the command of
a single person, and that for maintaining your rights, and declaring their
indignation against those who would have given him the Title of King.
The Senate suffered it with regret for your sakes only; for the Office of
Tribune belongs to the People, and not to the Senate. But not having
the power to accuse, or bring to judgment this Man, because of the great
Armies whereof he made himself Master, to the prejudice of the Roman
People, to whom they belonged, we applyed the only remedy left for the
chasing away the Tyranny, by conspiring all together against his person;
for it was requisite this Affair should be assented to by all honest Men,
though it were executed but by a few. And immediately after the Action
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65196:238"/>
the Senate declared it done by common deliberation, when they forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
proposed us rewards as for having slain a Tyrant. But <hi>Anthony</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
it under pretence of appeasing the tumult, and we our selves not
desiring any greater reward than the service of our Country, they were
not ordered because they would not defame <hi>Caesar,</hi> being content to have
thrown down the Tyranny. However, they decreed a general Indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
with prohibitions to all persons of prosecuting in form of Justice for
the action done; and a small time after, because <hi>Anthony</hi> incensed the
multitude against us by his Orations, the same Senate gave to us
the greatest Provinces of the Empire, with the command of Armies, and
an absolute power over all their Territories from the Ionian Sea to <hi>Syria;</hi>
was it to punish us as Villains and Murderers, that they thus honoured
us with the sacred Purple, with Rods and Axes? 'Twas for the same
reasons they recalled from Banishment the young <hi>Pompey,</hi> who had no
hand in the Conspiracy, but only was the Son of that great <hi>Pompey</hi> who
first took up Arms for the Common-wealth, and did in some measure op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Tyranny, by concealing himself in <hi>Spain.</hi> That they ordered
the value of his Father's Estate should be payed him out of the publick
Monies: that they made him Admiral over all Seas, to the end, that
having a love for the Common-wealth he might not be without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
After all these, can you desire more ample testimonies to incline
you to a belief, that the Senate knew and approved our Action, unless
possibly you expect they themselves should tell you so; but they will tell
it you, and with telling it you reward your services, as soon as they shall
have again attained the power of speaking, and giving rewards. For you
know in what condition the Senators Affairs stand at present, they are
proscribed without any form of Justice, their Goods are confiscated, and
without hearing them speak they are slain in their Houses, in the Streets,
in the Temples, by the Soldiers, by their Slaves, by their Enemies; they
are dragged out of their Coverts, and hunted from place to place, that
they may have no way to escape. We never were used to bring our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
Heads into the place, but only their Arms, and the Prows of their
Ships: now they expose there the Heads of the Consuls, Pretors, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
of the People, Roman Knights, and reward those commit such
Villanies. For 'tis a dreadful disorder. The enmities which have a long
time layn hid, now declare themselves openly, and many of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts
perish by the private hatred of their Wives, Children, Freed Men
and Slaves, so many cruelties has this Plague occasioned in the City, to
which the Triumvirs gave the first examples, by proscribing their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
their Uncles and their Tutors. 'Tis said, that <hi>Rome</hi> formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Prize to the most Barbarous Nations upon earth; but the Gauls
cut off no Heads, nor abused not dead Bodies, nor were troubled that
their Enemies fled, or hid themselves: and we our selves in all the Cities
we have taken, have neither acted, nor heard that ever were acted the
least of those cruelties which are now acted, not in a vulgar City, but in
the Mistress of the World, by Magistrates created to reform and restore
the Common-wealth. Was ever the like committed by <hi>Tarquin,</hi> who
only for acting a violence upon a Woman he loved, was driven out of
<hi>Rome</hi> by our Fore-fathers, and for that sole Action the Royalty abolished?
yet after all this, Citizens, we are treated as execrable persons by the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirs,
who say they revenge the death of <hi>Caesar,</hi> by proscribing persons
who were not in the City when he was slain, several of whom you see
here, who were only proscribed for their Riches, or Birth, or affection
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65196:238"/>
to the Common-wealth. Why was <hi>Pompey</hi> proscribed with us, he who
was in <hi>Spain</hi> at the time of the action, unless it be because he is a Son to a
Father that loved the Common-wealth; because the Senate recalled him
and gave him the Admiralty, therefore the Triumvirs judged him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of Proscription? Were the Women confederate in the Conspiracy,
those whom they have taxed with such immense Contributions? Had
the People committed any crime, for the punishment of which they had
reason to command every Man that was worth above a hundred thousand
Drams to make Declaration of it, under a penalty, if he failed. And
yet with all these cruelties, all these exactions, they have not been able to
raise Money to pay that Donative they promised to those Soldiers that
serve them; whilst we that have done nothing but what is reasonable,
have satisfied you the rewards we promised you, and have greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for you. The truth is because we have respect to Justice in all our
actions, the Gods favour our Designs. The Gods (I say) after whose
example you outht to consider humane Affairs, look upon your Fellow
Citizens, under whose Command you have often fought, and who have
with applause administred the Consulate, you see as well as we whither
they have been forced to flie for Refuge, because they have been good
Men, and Lovers of their Country. They embrace our Party, offer up
Vows for the prosperity of our Arms, and will never decline our interests.
Therefore have we proposed a greater and juster reward to those shall
save them, then our Enemies promise to their Murderers. On the other
side the Triumvirs imagine, that after having slain <hi>C. Caesar,</hi> because he
alone usurped the Sovereign Power, we will suffer them to divide it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, instead of restoring the Government of the Common-wealth
to the People, according to the establishment of our Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.
But as our intentions are different in this War, theirs tending only
to Dominion and Tyranny, as their Proscriptions have already made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
and we having no other aim but the liberty of our Country, in
which we shall content our selves to live equal with other Citizens, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the authority of the Laws, there is no doubt but Gods and Men will
esteem our Party the most just; and there's nothing in War gives better
hopes than the justice of the cause. Nor let any one make a scruple that
he has formerly served under <hi>Caesar;</hi> for he served not him but his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
nor was it he gave you rewards, but the Common-wealth, in the
same manner as you are not now the Army of <hi>Cassius</hi> or of <hi>Brutus,</hi> but
the Army of the Romans: we are only your companions, and if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
you, it is only in the name of the Senate and People of <hi>Rome.</hi>
Had our Enemies the same intentions with us, how easily might we all
disarm with security, and surrender up to the Common-wealth their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
to be employed for the public Good, we would our selves become
suppliants for it, if we thought they would accept of these conditions.

                           <p>Let us go whither you think fit to lead us.</p>
                           <p>

And <hi>Cassius</hi> glad to see them so well disposed, as soon as silence was made,
continued to speak in this manner:</p>
                           <p>May the Gods, who preside over just Wars, reward my Fellow Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
your Faith and Affection. As for that foresight your Generals, as
they are Men, ought to have, observe but how much we are at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
stronger than our Enemies: we are equal in number of Legions,
though we have left Men in many places where we judged it necessary:
we have far the greater number of Horse, Ships and Auxiliary Forces
sent us from Kings and Nations, extending as far as the Medes and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians.
Our Enemies can only assault us before, whereas we can like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
fall upon them behind, for we have <hi>Pompey</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Murcus</hi> in
the Ionian Sea, besides <hi>Aenobarbus</hi> has his Fleet well flesh'd with Seamen,
with two Legions, and good store of Archers, who do sorely annoy
them, whereas behind us, all is peaceable, both on Sea and Shore. As
for Money, which some call Nerves of War, they have none at all, not
being able to pay what they promised their Army, that brought in by
Proscriptions not answering their expectations, for no honest Man would
buy those Lands, the purchase of which would render him odious to all
the world: and they can have none elsewhere, <hi>Italy</hi> being drained dry
by Seditions, Exactions, and Proscriptions, whereas we have taken such
effectual care, that we have it in such abundance, that we are able to give
you another Donative; and the Provinces we have left behind us will suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
supply us. As for Provision which occasions all the difficulty for
the subsistance of great Armies, they can be supplyed only from <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
a Mountainous Country, or <hi>Thessaly,</hi> a Province of small extent,
and that by Land with incredible labour, and if they pretend to have it
brought from <hi>Africa, Lucania</hi> or <hi>Povilia, Pompey, Murcus</hi> or <hi>Aenobar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>
will cut off their passage. For our parts we have already plenty, and
more will dayly be brought by Sea from all the Islands, and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
between <hi>Thrace</hi> and the <hi>Euphrates</hi> easily, without the opposition of
any person, we having no Enemy behind us. These are, Fellow Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
the works of humane fore-sight, we expect the rest from you, and
the Gods. For our parts, besides what you have already received, we
will pay you what we have promised, and as we have already rewarded
your fidelity with a Donative; so by God's assistance, after having gained
the Victory, we will recompence you with something worthy your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.
And in the mean time, the more to encourage you, and because
I see the whole Assembly disposed to do well, as soon as I descend from
this Tribunal, we will give every Soldier fifteen hundred Italian Drams,
to every Centurion five times as much, and to every Tribune propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/> After having thus spake, and gained the hearts of the Army by Actions,
by Words, and by Gifts, he dismissed the Assembly, which yet would not
break up till after many Acclamations to <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> with promises
of good service, immediately they dist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ibuted in ready Money what they
had promised, gratifying with somewhat more, such as had signalized
themselves upon any other occasions, and as they received their Money they
sent them forward on their march towards <hi>Dorisca,</hi> whither in few days
the General followed them. At the same time two living Eagles came and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65196:239"/>
pearched upon the Siver Eagles of the Standard-bearers, and pecking at
them (as some say) and covering them with their Wings, there stayed.
The Generals caused Food to be given them till the day before the Battel,
when they fled away. After two days March on the Banks of the Black
Gulf, the Army came to <hi>Aena,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Dorisca,</hi> and other
Maritime Cities, as far as Mount <hi>Serria,</hi> which advances it self into the Sea,
from thence the Army turned into the Land; and <hi>Tullius Cimber</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
with the Fleet, one Legion, and some Archers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to proceed on the
way along the Coast. Now this Coast was formerly uninhabited, though
the Land were excellent good, because the Thracians made no advantage of
the conveniency of the Sea, nor so much as came near the Shore, for fear
of Ships that passed by. Afterward the Chalcidians and other Greeks u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Sea, inhabited, tilled it, and settled a Trade, besides that many
Thracians were well satisfied to change the Mountains for such a Residence,
till such time as <hi>Philip</hi> the Son of <hi>Amyntas</hi> chasing away the Chalcidians
and others, there remained no other marks of its ever being inhabited, save
the pavements of some Temples. <hi>Tullius</hi> then coasting along this desert
Shore, according to his Orders; when he came near the Straits of <hi>Salapeas</hi>
he began to set out the Lines of a Camp, and to chuse out certain Caves in
the Shore might serve to harbor his Ships, that <hi>Norbanus</hi> thinking it needless
to guard both Passes, might quit them. And indeed part of what he had
projected, happened; for as soon as <hi>Norbanus</hi> saw the Ships, fearful left he
alone should not be able to defend the passage of <hi>Salapeas,</hi> he sent presently
to <hi>Ceditius</hi> to quit that of <hi>Torpides,</hi> and come to his assistance, which he did,
and thus <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> finding the strait of <hi>Torpides</hi> deserted, passed it.
But the deceit being discovered, <hi>Norbanus,</hi> and <hi>Ceditius</hi> so well defended
that of <hi>Salapeas,</hi> that <hi>Brutus</hi>'s People not being able to force it were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartened, growing fearful lest at last they should be fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ced to go that great
way about, which at first they had declined, and withal return back all the
ground they had gone; besides that Summer was far spent. Whilst they
were in this trouble, <hi>Rascupolis</hi> to them, that he would find out a way be
which in three days they should cros all the Mountains of <hi>Salapeas,</hi> which
never any before had passed, by reason of the cragginess of the Rocks,
want of Water, and the thickness of the Woods, but if they would resolve
to carry Water with them, and cut a way through the Wood large enough
for them to pass, they should march under covert without being seen by any
Man, nay, not so much as by the very Birds, and on the fourth day should
arrive at the River <hi>Arpessa,</hi> which falls into the <hi>Heber,</hi> from whence in one
day they might reach <hi>Philippi,</hi> and so inclose their Enemies, that it would
be impossible for them to escape. Though no advice could be proposed,
in the execution whereof there could be more difficulty, yet this was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
the Soldiers being chiefly encouraged to it, by the hopes they had in
so short a time, to behold so great a number of Enemies in their power.
<hi>Lucius Bibulus</hi> having then together with <hi>Rascupolis</hi> taken upon him the
charge of preparing the way, they caused one half of the Army to move,
who, though it were with much labour and difficulty, marched on briskly
and cheerfully, especially after those who were sent before to discover,
brought word, that from the tops of the Hill they might see the River; but
the fourth day the Soldiers spent with travel, and tormented with thirst,
because the water brought with them failed, began to make reflection upon
what had been told them (that it was but three days march ere they should
find water) and to suspect some treason: not but they believed those who
assured them they had seen the River, but they imagined they were led out
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:65196:240"/>
of the way, and therefore afflicted themselves, as thinking they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed;
and when <hi>Rascupolis</hi> came to encourage them, they railed and
threw stones at him. At length <hi>Bibulus</hi> entreating them in the name of
the Gods, to wait with patience the close of that day, towards the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those that were in the Front perceived the River, whereupon with
shouts of joy giving the word back, it soon reached those in the rear.
<hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> having advice that a part of their Army was happily
passed, caused the rest to file off the same way, yet they could not conceal
their march from the Enemy, nor did they inclose them as <hi>Rascupolis</hi> had
made them hope. For <hi>Rascus</hi> his Brother having heard some shouts, grew
suspicious, and going himself upon the scout, made a perfect discovery,
with wonder that such mighty Forces had passed through a Country so dry,
and where the Wood was so thick, that he scarce believed the very Beasts
could have found a passage; and immediately giving notice hereof to <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus,</hi>
he the same night deserted <hi>Salapeas,</hi> and with what People he had
fled towards <hi>Amphipolis,</hi> insomuch, that in all the Armies nothing was so
much spoke of as these two Thracians, of the one for having been Guide
to the Army through such an unknown way; and of the other for discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it. Thus <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi>'s Forces by a wonderful Adventure came
to <hi>Philippi,</hi> whither <hi>Cimber</hi> being likewise arrived, they had a general Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous.
This City was formerly called <hi>Data,</hi> and before that<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>Crenides,</hi>
because of the many Springs about the Hill on which it is seated. <hi>Philip,</hi>
who found this place convenient to make War upon the Thracians, fortified
it, and called it by his name. On the North lie Woods, through which
<hi>Rascupolis</hi> brought the Army: on the East are the Straits of <hi>Salapeas</hi> and
<hi>Torpides:</hi> and on the West vast places which reach as far as the Cities of
<hi>Murcina, Dorabisca,</hi> and the <hi>Strymon,</hi> which is about<note n="*" place="margin">Near twenty Miles.</note> one hundred and
fifty Furlongs distant. The Soil is good, and the Country pleasant, and
'tis said that heretofore a young Damsel, as she was gathering Flowers,
was ravished by a God, and that in passing a River hard by, the Yoke of his
Chariot broke; whence the Greeks called that River <hi>Zygasbes:</hi> from <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi</hi>
to <hi>Amphipolis</hi> is an easie descent, so that Men go up hill from <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi>
and down from <hi>Philippi.</hi> At some distance from <hi>Philippi</hi> is another
eminence, said to be consecrated to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> where are Mines of Gold,
called <hi>Asyles,</hi> thence advancing ten Fulongs are found two other Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
distant from <hi>Philippi</hi> eighteen Furlongs, and eight one from the other,
upon which <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> pitched their Camps; <hi>Cassius</hi> on the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern,
and <hi>Brutus</hi> on the Northern. They pursued not <hi>Norbanus</hi> in this
flight, because word was brought that <hi>Anthony</hi> came on apace, having left
<hi>Caesar</hi> sick at <hi>Epidamnum.</hi> The Plain was very proper for a set Battel, and
the Eminencies commodious to encamp on; for on one side were Marishes
and Pools of Water as far as the <hi>Strymon;</hi> on the other inaccessible Straits.
The space between both of eight Furlongs was as it were the Passage or
Gate out of <hi>Europe</hi> into <hi>Asia,</hi> they caused Walls to be built from one Camp
to another, and left a Gate in the middle to joyn together when they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Hard by they had a River called <hi>Gang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>a</hi> or <hi>Gangira,</hi> and on their
Backs they had the Sea, by which they brought their Provisions from
<hi>Thassa,</hi> not above one hundred Furlongs distant, where they kept their
Stores, and for their Gallies they left them at <hi>Nea,</hi> not above seventy Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
distant, insomuch that they were extremely satisfied with having
found a place so commodious, and where they could with so great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
post themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:65196:240"/>
Mean while <hi>Anthony</hi> advanced by great Marches to possess himself of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVIII"/>
                  <hi>Amphipolis,</hi> which he had designed to make the Seat of the War. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he found <hi>Norbanus</hi> had fortified it to receive him, wherewith he was
extremely well pleased: He left there all his Stores, with a Legion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by <hi>Pinnarius,</hi> to keep the Guard of them; and with an astonishing
boldness advancing still forward, went and encamped in the Plain, eight
furlongs distant from the Enemy. Now was plainly to be seen the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
that <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> had over <hi>Anthony</hi> in the Seat of their Camps:
For they were encamped upon Hills, he on the even Plain; they fetched
Wood from the Mountains, he from a Marish; they watered at a River, he
at a Well which himself dug; their Stores were at <hi>Thassa,</hi> not far distant;
his at <hi>Amphipolis,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Above forty Miles.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> three hundred and fifty Furlongs from the Camp: So
that in all appearance <hi>Anthony</hi> seemed to have encamped there out of pure
necessity, all the high Ground being seized upon, and the rest of the Plain
so low, that sometimes the River overflowed it. And indeed, in sinking
Wells, they found abundance of fresh Water. However, though this
boldness were an effect of necessity, yet it stroke some kind of terror in the
Enemy; who were amazed to see him, after so long a March, as soon as he
arrived, come, and with so much scorn encamp so nigh them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they raised a great number of Forts, with Ditches, Palissadoes and
Walls, whilst he only wrought upon the Lines of his Camp. <hi>Cassius,</hi> for
his part seeing this raving fury of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s, caused a little space of Ground
that lay betwixt his Camp and the Marish, which before he had neglected,
to be now fortified, that he might omit nothing for the security of the
Camps; for the outmost side of <hi>Brutus</hi>'s was defended by Rocks, and that
of <hi>Cassius</hi>'s by the Marish; and the space between both shut up with Ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
Pallissadoes, Walls and Gates. Whilst the one and the other were busie
at their Intrenchments, their Horse and Light armed Foot made tryal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
each other in some Skirmishes: But after that their Works were
brought to perfection, and <hi>Caesar</hi> was come (though he had not yet recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
so much health as to be able to fight in Person, and was fain to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about the Ranks in his Litter) all their Forces drew out in order of Battel.
On the other side, <hi>Brutus</hi> likewise drew out his Army upon the Hill, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
not to come down, for he had no desire to fight, being in hopes the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
would soon be in want of Provisions. There were on each side nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Legions; of which, those on <hi>Brutus</hi> side were not compleat, whereas
in those of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s there were Supernumeraries. As for the Horse, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Thracian Auxiliaries on both sides; <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> had thirteen
thousand Horse, and <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> had twenty thousand: So that both
for the number of Men, the bravery and valour of the Commanders, the
Arms and Artillery, it was a glorious sight to see these two Armies. Yet
they lay several days without doing any thing; for <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi>
would not fight, but rather starve their Enemies; they having for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>Asia</hi> and all the Countries adjacent to furnish them with all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
which were brought to them by Sea; whereas the Enemy neither
had Provisions, nor any place whence to fetch them; for the Merchants
could not bring any from <hi>Egypt,</hi> at present afflicted with Famine: <hi>Pompey,
Murcus</hi> and <hi>Aenobarbus</hi> stopped their coming from <hi>Africa, Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi>
and <hi>Macedon</hi> and <hi>Thessaly,</hi> who only fed the Army, were not long able to
maintain it. <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> knew all this very well, and were therefore
in no haste to give Battel; but <hi>Anthony,</hi> who was apprehensive of Famine,
resolved to force them to it. He imagined that if secretly he could contrive
the making of a way cross the Marish, he might cut off the Enemy's Passage
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:65196:241"/>
for their Provisions brought them from <hi>Thassa,</hi> Having therefore several
times caused the Army, with all their Ensigns, to draw out into Battel, as if
all his Force had been there; wrought night and day with a Party he had
drawn out of the Gross, to make a little way through the Marish; cutting
of Bushes, and raising a Causway; supported with Walls on both sides, lest
it should tumble down; and driving in Piles on those places he could not fill
up, on which he placed Bridges of Wood with such a profound silence,
that the Enemy perceived nothing; for the Bushes they left on both sides
the Causway hindred their Prospect. The Work being finished in ten days,
he sent by night a great number of Cohorts to the other side; who seizing
on some advantageous Posts, raised Forts which they soon brought into a
condition of defence. <hi>Cassius</hi> was astonished at this Undertaking, and at
the secrecy of its Execution: And to put the change upon <hi>Anthony,</hi> by hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
his Communication with his Forts: He undertook likewise a like
Work quite cross the Marish, from his Camp to the Sea. They therefore
began to raise Terrasses, and to place Bridges of Wood on Piles in the
deepest places, as had been done by <hi>Anthony;</hi> and already the Causway
which he had made was broken, so that those which were passed over had
no way of Return, nor could he, though he knew it, releive them. This
put him in such a rage, that, though it was already Noon, he immediately
made his Army which was on the other side march to the Intrenchment
which first <hi>Cassius</hi> had made between his Camp and the Marish; making
them bring with them Spades, Pick axes and Ladders; resolving after he
had carried it, to storm <hi>Cassius</hi> his Camp. Mean while, as <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Men
made their Bravadoes in that Space which was between the two Camps,
<hi>Brutus</hi>'s Men thinking it a shame for them, if, armed as they were, they
suffered their Enemies, unpunished, to affront them to their very Beards;
without any other Orders than that of a Tribune, sallyed out; and charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in Flank, killed as many as they could reach: and having once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
the Fight, turned upon the Gross of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Army, which was march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards them; put them to flight, and pursued them to the very Camp,
and at last became Masters of the Camp it self, which was in common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony. Caesar</hi> was not there because of a Dream, by
which he was advertized to absent himself that day, as himself has writ in
his Commentaries. But <hi>Anthony</hi> seeing the Fight grow hot, was very glad
to see the Enemy engaged, for he was mighty fearful of wanting Provisions;
yet he would not return into the Plain for fear of disordering his Ranks in
countermarching his Army, but continued his March towards the Hill;
which, in spite of the Darts lanced at him from above by the Enemy, he
mounted, and came to handy strokes with <hi>Cassius</hi>'s Army, which was
there drawn up, and stood amazed at an Attempt so little judicious. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
presently broken them, and put them into disorder, he assaulted the
Trench between the Camp and the Marsh; and with an incredible brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
pulled out the Pallissadoes, filled up the Ditch, beat down the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
cut in pieces the greatest part of those that defended the Gate, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
over the Bellies of the rest, and threw himself into the place. Many
of his People entred by the Breaches of the Rampart, some clambered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heaps of dead Bodies: And all this was done in such a moment of time,
that those who were at work in the Marish came not to the Assistance of
their Companions till their Trench was gained; and then <hi>Anthony</hi> and
those that entred with him charging them with fury, drove them back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Marish; and returned to assault <hi>Cassius</hi> his Camp, whilst the rest of
the Army were still fighting with <hi>Cassius</hi>'s People without the Trench. The
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65196:241"/>
Camp, because it was strong of it self, was very slenderly guarded, and
therefore soon forced; whereupon, those who defended themselves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and were before hard put to it, seeing now their Camp in the power
of the Enemies, betook themselves to a shameful flight. Thus the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
became equal on both sides; <hi>Brutus</hi> beat the Enemy on the left Wing,
and took their Camp; and <hi>Anthony</hi> on the other side, by a wonderful bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
took <hi>Cassius</hi>'s Camp, after having slain great numbers of his Men. The
dust flew so thick in the Field of the Battel, that one Party knew not what
had happened to the other. And when the Soldiers came to know the
place where they were, they called to them their Fellows, who looked ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like Day-labourers than Soldiers; being so besmeared with dust, they
could scarce be known; and certainly had one Party of them met another
loaden with Booty, they had again fought for their Spoil. It is thought
that on <hi>Cassius</hi>'s side there might be slain about eight thousand besides Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies,
and on <hi>Caesar</hi>'s side twice as many more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cassius</hi> having lost his Camp, and all hopes of regaining it, retreated to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/>
a Hill hard by <hi>Philippi</hi> to see what passed; but because the dust was so
thick that he could see nothing but that his Camp was taken, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Pindarus</hi> his Esquire to kill him. As <hi>Pindarus</hi> was excusing himself
from doing it, there came a Man from <hi>Brutus,</hi> to tell him that <hi>Brutus</hi> on his
side had the better, and was Master of the Enemy's Camp: To which he
made only this short Answer; <hi>Tell him I wish him an entire Victory.</hi> And
turning at the same time towards <hi>Pindarus; Why delay you,</hi> said he, <hi>dispatch
and free me from this Infamy. Pindarus</hi> thereupon ran him with his Sword
into the throat, and so died <hi>Cassius,</hi> according to the opinion of some. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
say, that some Horse-men coming to bring him the News of <hi>Brutus</hi>'s
Victory, he imagined they were Enemies, and sent to <hi>Titinius</hi> to know the
certainty; and that those Horse-men having received <hi>Titinius</hi> as <hi>Cassius</hi> his
Friend, with Caresses and Shouts of joy, he believed <hi>Titinius</hi> was fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of the Enemy; and saying, <hi>We have stayed to see them take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
our Friend,</hi> retired with <hi>Pindarus</hi> into his Tent, and was no more seen:
wherefore, some think he slew his Master without having any Command
to do it. However it were, <hi>Cassius</hi> died on his Birth-day after this Battel,
which passed as we have described. <hi>Titinius</hi> likewise slew himself for grief
that he was not come sooner, to give him an Answer: and <hi>Brutus,</hi> weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over <hi>Cassius</hi>'s Body, called him the last of the Romans, whose Vertue
would never find its Equal; lamented his haste and precipitation, and yet
esteemed him happy in being delivered from those cares and troubles in
which he was engaged, and of which he knew not the Success. At length,
having delivered the Body to his Friends to be privately disposed, lest the
sight of it might sadden the Army; without taking any food, or sleeping,
he spent the night in rallying <hi>Cassius</hi>'s Troops. On the Morrow the Enemies
appeared in Battel, that they might make it be thought they had no disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:
but knowing their thoughts, <hi>Let us arm too,</hi> said he, <hi>and by a like
Fiction conceal our loss.</hi> But the Enemy retreating at the same time that he
drew up his Army in Battel, he jestingly said to his Friend; <hi>These people
who came out to fight us, thinking us wearied, durst not make the Experiment.</hi>
The same day of this Battel of <hi>Philippi,</hi> there happened on the Ionian Sea a
memorable Defeat. <hi>Domitius Calvinus</hi> was bringing over to <hi>Caesar</hi> upon
Ships of Burthen, two Legions; one of which was for its valour honoured
with the Title of Martial; with a Pretorian Cohort, or Regiment of two
thousand Men, four Troops of Horse, and other choice Foot, which were
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:65196:242"/>
convoyed by some Gallies. <hi>Murcus</hi> and <hi>Aenobarbus</hi> engaging them with
one hundred and thirty long Ships, part of the Ships of Burthen escaped at
first with a fresh Gale; but the Wind ceasing all on a suddain, the rest were
surprized with a Calm, and were not able to stir; as if God had delivered
them up to their Enemies; who began to assault them one after another,
and to send them to the bottom; for the Gallies, which were but few in
number, could not releive them, being kept off by the long Ships: Not but
that, in the danger wherein they were, they did all that was possible for
Men to do; they at first lashed their Ships fast together with Booms and
Cables, that the Enemy might not separate them. But when this succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
well for a while, <hi>Murcus</hi> at length cast into them great numbers of fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Darts, which forced them to cast off as fast as they had got together,
and strive to get clear of one another, lest they should all burn together.
So that they again saw themselves exposed to the shock of <hi>Murcus</hi> Prows,
or else were soon encompassed each one by a great number. The Soldiers
were in despair, especially those of the Martial Legion; that, brave as they
were, they must die unrevenged. Some slew themselves for fear of being
burnt; others leaped into the Enemies Ships, and were cut in pieces fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Some Ships half burnt rowed a long time upon the Water, with the
Men wherewith they were laden; some whereof perished by the Fire, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
by Hunger and Thirst. Others grasping Masts or Planks, were cast
either upon Rocks or desert Shores. Some were saved beyond all hopes;
and some there were remained five days upon the Sea, licking the Pitch,
or eating Sails and Cordage; till at last the Waves cast them on Shore.
Many overpressed with so many misfortunes, yielded themselves with their
Vessels; among which were seventeen Gallies, whose Sea-men and Soldiers
turned to <hi>Murcus</hi>'s Party, and swore Fidelity to him. <hi>Calvinus</hi> their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain,
whom all Men thought lost, returned the fifth day to <hi>Brundusium</hi>
with his Ship. And this, that may be called Ship-wrack or Sea-fight, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
on the Ionian Sea, the same day that the Battel of <hi>Philippi</hi> was fought,
to the wonder of all the World that knew it.</p>

                           <p>IN what passed yesterday, Fellow-Soldiers, we gained the advantage of our
Enemies in all points; for you begun the Fight chearfully, though you had
no Command to do it; cut in pieces the fourth Legion, drawn up of purpose in
that Station because of its Valour; and pursued them into their Camp, which
you took and plundered: So that this Victory very much exceeds the Loss we
suffered on the Left Wing. You might have made it perfect, had you not thought
it better to rifle the Enemies Carriages, than utterly to ruin them; for most of
you let the Men escape, to fall upon the Baggage. In which, yet we had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for of two Camps we had, they took but one; whereas, we became Masters
of all they had: so that in that point their loss was twice as great as ours. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
then, we have had all the advantage of the Fight. And now, to know
the whole of our Strength, you need only ask the Prisoners; they will tell you
how scarce Victuals are in their Army, how dear they cost, with what difficulty
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65196:242"/>
they are brought to them, and that they can scarce find any more to bring:
For <hi>Pompey, Murcus</hi> and <hi>Aenobarbus,</hi> who keep the Sea with two hundred
and sixty Ships, prevent the bringing any from <hi>Sicily, Sardinia, Africa</hi> and
<hi>Spain:</hi> They have already drained <hi>Macedon,</hi> and now only <hi>Thessaly</hi> affords
them a Subsistance; and pray judge you if that can last any long time. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when you behold them urging you to fight; know that, ready to perish with
hunger, they seek an honourable death: Therefore our endeavours ought to be to
fight them first with Famine, and when we see it convenient for our purpose we
may fall on; and shall then find them so weak and feeble, they will not be able to
defend themselves; but let not us permit our Courage to transport us before it be
time. If any one say this is retreating instead of advancing, let him look upon
the Sea behind us; which brings us abundance of all Conveniences, offers us an
opportunity of overcoming without danger, provided you can but have patience,
and not grow hot when they come to make a Bravado, and defie you to the Battel:
For it is not Generosity in them, as yesterday's Fight made appear; but that they
may deliver themselves of another fear. But though I now desire you to moderate
your Courage, yet pray remember to act with the same warmth and vigour when I
shall demand the effects of it. And I promise you, when it shall please God to
give us a perfect Victory, to pay you punctually the Rewards we have promised;
in the mean time, for those brave things you did yesterday, I will this day give e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Soldier a thousand Drams, and the Officers proportionably.</p>

                           <p>THough when our Enemies talk of yesterday's Action, they may say, that in
part they gained the Victory, because they put some of ours to flight, and
took our Camp; yet in reality they confess you to be absolutely victorious; for I
dare assure you that neither to morrow nor in a long time after it, they will not
dare to engage you again unless they are forced to it; which is an indubitable
proof of your yesterday's victory, and their present fear. As Wrestlers in the
Gymnick Games, when they decline the strife, acknowledge themselves the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
They have indeed assembled all this mighty Army only to come and encamp
in the passages into <hi>Thrace,</hi> and there continue: for the same fear that made
them fortifie themselves at our first coming; hinders them from drawing out
after the disgrace they yesterday received, which was such as obliged the most
ancient and most experienced of their Generals to kill himself, a most ample
Testimony of their disorder. These are the reasons why they come not down
when we defie them, but trust more in their Rocks than their Arms. Now brave
Romans make your gallantry appear, and force them to fight as yesterday you
forced them, and certainly it would be dishonourable for you not to dare to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
Cowards trembling with fear, or to suffer it to be said that men like you
were of less strength than Walls. For we are not come hither to remain all
our lifetime in the Field, where we cannot subsist, for all provisions will soon
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65196:243"/>
fail us, and if that were not, yet every wise Man will put an end to War with
the soonest, and enjoy the sweets of peace the longest he can possibly: we will
therefore give orders to lay hold on time and occasion. We I say whose courage
and conduct you repent not to have yesterday followed, and you for your parts
let your Generals <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

trouble not your selves for the baggage you yesterday lost; for our riches consist not
in that, but in the victory, which if we gain will not only restore what our Enemies
took from us, but make all they have ours; if therefore you are in hast to recover
them, make haste to fight. Not but that yesterday we recovered a great deal, it
may be more than we lost; for they had in their Camp all the riches of which they
had robbed <hi>Asia;</hi> and you, when you came from home, left behind you whatever
was precious, and brought nothing but what was necessary. So that if there
were anything valuable in our Camp, it was your Generals Equipage, a loss they
are so far from considering they are ready to venture all that they have left to make
you perfectly victorious: nor shall that hinder us from giving as a reward of
your Victory five thousand Drams to every Soldier, five and twenty thousand
to every Centurion, and to every Tribune fifty thousand.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXI"/> On the morrow he drew out his Army, but the Enemies not coming
down, he was troubled, yet he continued every day to do the same; <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
on his side always kept one part of his Army at their Arms, in case he
should be forced to fight, and planted the other upon the way by which the
Victuallers brought their Provisions to favour their passage: there was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Hill near <hi>Cassi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> his Camp, of which the Enemies could not possess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
but with difficulty, because from the Camp they might be galled
with Darts and Arrows; yet <hi>Cassius</hi> had placed a Guard there for fear lest
some might be so bold as to come and lodge there. <hi>Brutus</hi> having flighted
it, <hi>Caesar</hi>'s People one night seised upon it, bringing with them great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
of Hides and Hurdles to defend them from the Darts. This Hill being
taken, ten other Legions went and encamped five Furlongs off, near the
Sea, and two Legions advancing four Furlongs further, posted themselves
so, that they might reach to the very shore. Their design was to make
an attempt either upon the Shore, or cross the Marish, or by some other
invention to cut off the passage of Provisions to <hi>Brutus,</hi> but he took care to
prevent them by building Forts directly opposite to the Enemies Camp,
which gave them no small vexation; for they were manifestly afflicted
with Famine, which dayly more and more growing upon them, as much
increased their fears. <hi>Thessaly</hi> was not able to supply them with Provisions
enough, and by Sea they could not hope to have any, <hi>Brutus</hi> being Master,
besides the news of the Sea Fight on the Ionian Sea was come to both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
which gave them fresh occasions of fear, and Winter approaching, it
would be an unsufferable annoyance if they should be forced to endure it,
encamped in the Marishes. To make the best provision in these straits they
could, they sent a Legion into <hi>Achaia</hi> to get in what provision they could,
and send it away speedily to the Army, but that could not all warrant them
from the dangers wherewith they were threatned. Wherefore seeing
all their endeavours could not oblige the Enemy to a Fight, and that in vain
they every day drew out into the Plain, they advanced up to the very
Trenches with shouts and revilings to incense <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Men, who they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
not to besiege, but to force to fight at what rate soever. But <hi>Brutus</hi>
continued firm in his first resolution, the rather, because he knew they were
ready to perish with hunger, and because his Fleet had got the better in the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65196:243"/>
Sea Fight, so that perceiving the despair the Enemies want had brought
them to, he chose rather to see himself besieged, or endure any thing than
fight with hunger-starved and desperate Men, who expected no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
than from their Arms. But to this the Soldiers could not consent, nor
endure to be thus shut up like Women, without doing any thing. The
Officers themselves complained not that they disapproved <hi>Brutus</hi>'s design,
but that ascertaining themselves upon the disposition they beheld in the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
they believed they should advance the Victory. The mildness and
courteous temper of <hi>Brutus</hi> to all Men occasioned much of this; for <hi>Cassius</hi>
was severe and imperious, the Officers of his Army executed his Orders
without asking a reason of them; and though they did not approve them,
durst not contradict them. But <hi>Brutus</hi> was willing to do all things with
the approbation and consent of those commanded in the Army. At last the
Soldiers began to gather in Companies, and to ask one another, <hi>Why has
our General so ill an opinion of us? what fault have we committed? have we
not beaten and put to flight our Enemies, cut in pieces their best Companies, and
forced their Camp?</hi> Yet he still dissembled it, and would not speak to them
for fear of doing any thing might reflect on his Honour, by suffering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be led by a blind multitude, especially the Strangers, who as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
as Slaves would every day be changing Masters, and on the first occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
would desert him. But when he saw himself importuned by the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes
and the Centurions, who advised him to take that opportunity,
whilst the Soldiers burning with a desire to fight, would possibly do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
great, (besides, if any misfortune happened, they could retreat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Trenches, and defend themselves) he grew angry that his Officers
should give him such counsel, and suffer themselves to be so easily carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by the impatience of his Soldiers, who chose rather to hazard the loss
of all, than to overcome without danger. However, he consented, though
to theirs, and his own ruine; saying only this short sentence, <hi>I see I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to make War as</hi> Pompey <hi>did, and rather to be commanded than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi>
For my part I believe he said no more for fear of discovering what
he most of all feared, lest the Army which had formerly served under <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
should upon discontent go over to the Enemy. For this was what both
<hi>Cassius</hi> and he had from the beginning some suspicion of, and therefore took
care not to give the Soldiers any cause of dissatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Brutus</hi> drew his Men out of the Camp much against his will, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXII"/>
drew them up in order, but still forbad them going too far from the Hill,
that their retreat might be more easie, and that they might from above
charge the Enemy more advantageously with their missile Arms. Both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were in a brave and fighting condition, and therefore came resolutely
forth to the Battel, animated by reasonable considerations; on the one side
the fear of Famine, and on the other by a just Shame, for having forced
their General to fight before he had a mind to it. Wherefore they burn'd
with desire to make him see in their deeds the same Bravery and Courage
they had boasted in words, for fear lest he should reproach them of having
been carried away rather by rashness than prudence. <hi>Brutus</hi> going on
Horseback from Quarter to Quarter with a severe look, put them in mind
of it, and the better to imprint it in their thoughts, as time gave leave,
spoke these words, <hi>You would needs fight, and have forced me to conquer in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
manner than I desired. But have a care you do not deceive both your
own hopes and mine: you have the advantage of the Hill, which fights for you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
all behind you is on your side, whereas the Enemy are to defend themselves both
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65196:244"/>
against you and Famine.</hi> To which discourse which he made as he went up
and down the Army, they answered him with shouts of joy and promises
of well doing. <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> in the mean time went each on their
side through the Ranks, encouraging their Soldiers with hand and voice,
without flattering them, or dissembling the condition wherein they were,
being certain to die by Famine if they got not the Victory, which was a
powerful motive to spur them on: <hi>We have found our Enemy,</hi> said they,
<hi>and have got him now, Fellow Soldiers, out of his Trenches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from whence we
have taken so much pains to draw him; but after having provoked him by so
many defiances, have a care of your Honour, and let your Actions make good
the threats you have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ttered. Chuse now either to fight against hunger an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Enemy which gives no Quarter, or against Men who cannot stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you, if you employ but your Arms, your Courage, nay, your very Despair,
as you ought to do. For our Affairs are in such a condition, they admit of no
delay, this day must put an end to the War, either by an entire Victory, or a
glorious death. If you come off victorious, you will in one sole day and one only
Fight get Provision, Treasure, Fleets, Arms, and besides all the Donative we
have promised you for the Victory, which will surely be ours, if in giving the
onset we remember the necessity to which we are reduced; and after having put
them in disorder, seise the Gates of their Camp, and drive them either among
the Precipices, or into the Plain, so that they can no more rally, or shut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up in those Trenches, where, by a cowardise unheard yet in any Enemy,
they place their hopes not in fighting, but in not fighting at all.</hi> By these
words <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> so encouraged their Soldiers, that they would
have blushed not to have answered their Generals expectation, besides there
being no other way to remedy their want of Provisions, which was aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by what had happened on the Ionian Sea; they chose rather to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
the worst that could befal them in Fight, than to perish by a misery
inevitable, Upon these Motives the two Armies were inflamed with an
incredible ardour. The Soldiers no more remembred they were Fellow
Citizens, but threatened each other as if they had been two Nations that
had been at a perpetual enmity. Such power now had anger got over
them above either reason or nature. And in short, both Parties divined
that this Battel would decide the destiny of the Roman Empire, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it did. After having employed one part of the day in preparing
themselves, about nine of the Clock two Eagles began to fight between the
two Armies, who observed them with a profound silence, till such time as
that on <hi>Brutus</hi>'s side turning tail, gave occasion to the contrary Party with
great shouts to run on upon their Enemies. The Charge was fierce and
cruel, for they threw away, as useless, their Piles and all other Weapons
ordinarily used in Fight, to come to the Swords point; they gave neither
blow nor thrust in vain, and each side endeavoured to break through, and
disorder the opposite Ranks, the one Party fighting for safety more than
for Victory; and the other for Victory only, remembring that by their
importunity they had forced their General to engage. Nothing was to be
seen but slaughter, nor heard but groans: as soon as any one fell, those of
his Party drew him off, and another fresh Man stepped in out of the next
Rank to supply his place. Mean while the Generals acted wonders, they
run from place to place, and shewed themselves every where, encouraging
those whom they saw had the advantage, and exhorting others whom they
perceived overpressed, yet to hold out a little till they could send fresh Men
to disengage them. Thus the Front of the Battel was always full: yet at
last <hi>Caesar</hi>'s People either pressed forward by their fear of Famine, or spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:65196:244"/>
on by his good fortune (for <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Men were no way faulty) made
the first Line of the Enemies a little recoil, who gave ground without any
trouble or disorder, as if it had been a great Machine removed at once; but
at last the first Rank being broken, those who fought in it retreated more
nimbly into the second, and those of the second into the third, that it begat
some confusion, for they were both pressed upon by the Enemies and those
of their own Party, so that they betook themselves to a disorderly flight.
And now <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Men, according to the command they had received, seised
upon the Gate, though with a great deal of danger; for they were sorely
galled by Darts from the Rampart, and by those who yet stood their
ground without, till such time as the Enemy, utterly defeated, and put to
the Rout, not being able to gain entrance, fled some towards the Sea, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to the Mountains by the Valley of the River <hi>Sygastus.</hi> The Generals
parted betwixt the Remainder of the Work; and <hi>Caesar</hi> staying to oppose
those who made offer to fally out of <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Camp, and to guard their own;
<hi>Anthony</hi> took upon him the whole Function of General: he pursued the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives,
cut in pieces those who yet made any resistance, and fearful lest the
chief Commanders escaping from this Defeat should get on Foot another
Army, he sent his Horse to all the Avenues, some to one side, and some to
another: one Party under the Command of <hi>Rascus</hi> the Thracian, who
knew the Country, fetched a turn about the Mountains, so that the
Trenches and Precipices of the Camp were surrounded on all sides by
Guards placed by <hi>Anthony,</hi> to hinder any person from retreating, and if
any did come out, they hunted them like Beasts: others followed <hi>Brutus</hi>
upon full speed, and were not far from him when <hi>Lucilius Lucinus</hi> seeing
them come, stopped, and as if he had been <hi>Brutus,</hi> prayed them to carry him
to <hi>Anthony,</hi> and not to <hi>Caesar,</hi> which confirmed their opinion that it was <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
indeed, because he would not fall into the hands of his mortal Enemy:
<hi>Anthony</hi> having notice that they were bringing him, went forthwith to meet
them, making reflection upon the Fortune, Dignity, and Virtue of the
Man, and consulting with himself how he should receive him. When he
was near, <hi>Lucinus</hi> advancing, fiercely told him, Brutus <hi>is not taken, nor shall
basen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that would have taken him, and behold me now in your power.</hi> Whereupon
<hi>Anthony</hi> seeing the Horsemen that brought him ashamed at their mistake,
comforted them with these words: <hi>The Prize you have taken is not of less
value then that you thought to have made; nay, 'tis rather of much greater, as a
Friend is worth more than an Enemy.</hi> And at the same instant delivering <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi>
into the hands of some of his Friends to have a care of him, he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
treated him like a person in whom he had confidence.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Brucus</hi> he escaped into the Mountains, where rallying some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIII"/>
Forces resolved to return by night into his Camp, or get down to
the Sea side; but because the Enemy had seised of all the Passes, he stayed
there all that night in Arms with the People he had: and it is said, that
looking up to the Stars he pronounced this Verse:
<q>Thou know'st, O <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who causes all these woes.</q>
Meaning it by <hi>Anthony:</hi> and indeed as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>ith repentance, acknowledged,
that whereas he might have made an accommodation with <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>
he made himself Serjeant to <hi>Octavius.</hi> That same night <hi>Anthony</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65196:245"/>
directly opposite to <hi>Brutus,</hi> without other intrenchment than heaps
of Arms and dead Bodies, which served him instead of Ramparts; and
<hi>Caesar</hi> having watched till Midnight, being sick withdrew, and left the
Guard of the Camp to <hi>Norbanus.</hi> On the morrow, <hi>Brutus</hi> seeing that the
Enemy quitted not their Post, and that he had with him but four Legions,
and those too not complete, he believed it not secure for him to speak to
them himself, but sent the Tribunes, ashamed of the fault they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
to sound the minds of the Soldiers, and know of them whether
they would undertake to open themselves a way through their Enemies to
regain their Camp where their Companions still guarded their Equipage:
but these People went so chearfully to the Fight, and had so long and so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerously
sustained the Enemy, as if God had now forsaken them, returned
answer to their General, that the counsel he gave them was worthy of him
but that for their parts they had so often tempted fortune, that they would
not now quite lose all hopes of making conditions for themselves. Then
said <hi>Brutus</hi> to his Friends; <hi>I can do my Country no farther service, if they
have taken such resolutions.</hi> And at the same time he called <hi>Strato</hi> the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot
his Friend, whom he intreated to kill him; <hi>Strato</hi> advising him to think
more seriously upon it, he called to one of his Domesticks, upon which
<hi>Strato</hi> said, Brutus, <hi>since you are resolved, you have a Friend more ready to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
your last command than all your Slaves.</hi> And saying so, thrust his Sword
betwixt his Ribs, which he received without moving. Thus ended <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
and <hi>Cassius</hi> the most generous and illustrious of the Romans, whose Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
had never been equalled, had it not been sullied with <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Blood,
who though they were of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Party, from Enemies had made them
Friends, and afterwards loved them like his Children. The Senate had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a great inclination for them, and after their death did much compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
their misfortune; for their sakes only they had passed the general
Amnesty, and when they left the City gave them Government for fear they
should pass for banished Men. Not that all that composed this noble Body
hated <hi>Caesar,</hi> or were satisfied with what was done; for living they had
been admirers of his Virtuee and Fortune; and dead, they had solemnized
his Funeral at the publick Charge, confirmed all that he had done, and
granted places and trusts in the City according to the Memorandums by
him left, not thinking it possible for themselves to dispose of it more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently:
and yet the affection they bore these great Men, and the care they
took of their safety, gave occasion to suspicions and scandals, so mightily
they were favoured by the Senate. And the greater part of the Exiles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
them before <hi>Pompey</hi> himself; for <hi>Pompey</hi> being near the City might
incline to an Accommodation, whereas they were far off and implacable.
Moreover, when they saw themselves forced to take up Arms, they had in
less then two years got together more than twenty Legions, almost twenty
thousand Horse, more than two hundred long Ships, and considerable Stores
of all warlike Provisions. They had raised likewise vast Sums in <hi>Asia,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by good will, or by force: and in those Wars they waged with divers
Cities who held on the adverse Party, they almost continually came off vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious,
till they became Masters of all that Country extending from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi>
to the <hi>Euphrates:</hi> and all those with whom they had mad War ranged
themselves on their Party, and continued faithful to them. They likewise
made use of many Kings and Prices; nay, of the Parthians themselves,
though Enemies to the Romans; but this was only in matters of small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,
for in the great Affairs when all was disputed, they stayed not
their coming for fear of teaching a Barbarous Nation, and always an Enemy,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:65196:245"/>
how to fight with the Romans. But what most of all ought to be admired
at, is, that the greatest part of their Army was composed of Soldiers that
had served under <hi>Caesar,</hi> and that after his being slain, the affection of the
Soldiery was unhappily transported to these his Murderers so firmly, that
they afterwards were more stedfast in observing their faith to them against
his Son, than to <hi>Anthony</hi> himself who had commanded them under <hi>Caesar,</hi>
for none of them deserted <hi>Brutus</hi> or <hi>Cassius,</hi> even in their utmost misfortune,
whereas all of them revolted from <hi>Anthony</hi> at <hi>Brundusium</hi> in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the War he had with <hi>Octavius.</hi> They made their pretence of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Arms, both now and in <hi>Pompey</hi>'s time not private advantage, but the
name of the Common-wealth; specious indeed, but usually of little effect,
and when they thought themselves no longer serviceable to their Country,
they equally despised their lives. As for their particular conduct, <hi>Cassius</hi>
like the Gladiators which mind only their Enemies, had fixed his thoughts
upon War, and thought of nothing else. But <hi>Brutus</hi> who in all times and
occasions was a Philosopher, was pleased to look into, and understand many
things; yet when all is said that possibly can be to assure them great Men,
the assault they made upon <hi>Caeser</hi>'s person was the only cause none of their
designs prospered: and certainly it was no ordinary crime, nor of little
consequence, for they had unhappily murdered their Friend, their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,
one who by right of War might have disposed of their lives, and
yet had saved them, their General in the Senate, in a sacred place, cloath'd
in his holy Robes, the most powerful of all the Romans; and which is most
of all, the Man of all the world most serviceable to the Empire and his
Country. And Heaven accordingly sent tokens of its anger, and presages
of their ruine; for when <hi>Cassius</hi> offered Sacrifices to purge his Army, one
of the Lictors put a Crown reversed upon his Head; a Golden Image of
Victory, which he then offered, fell down of it self, many Flocks of Birds
of Prey came and set about his Camp without making any noise, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
dayly they saw Swarms of Bees. They saw likewise that <hi>Brutus</hi> cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating
at <hi>Samos,</hi> in the midst of their Jollity and Feasting, wherein he
was not used to be out of temper, with a sudden passion uttered these Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:
<q>
                     <l>But 'twas <hi>Latona</hi>'s Son, and angry Fate</l>
                     <l>Advanc'd my death—</l>
                  </q>
And that when he was designing to pass out of <hi>Asia</hi> into <hi>Europe</hi> with his
Army, as he watched by night, and his Candle almost spent, there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him a Ghost with a strange kind of countenance, at which not moved,
he asked what it was, God or Man, to which the Ghost answered; Brutus,
<hi>I am thy evil Genius, thou shalt see me again at</hi> Philippi. And in truth, 'tis
said, it appeared to him the day before the last Battel, and that when he
drew his Army out of the Camp an Ethiopian met him, whom presently
the enraged Soldiers cut in pieces. This was likewise a token of their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
that <hi>Cassius</hi> after a Fight, wherein the loss had been almost equal,
fell so easily into despair; and that <hi>Brutus,</hi> forced to violate the prudent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
he had taken, to temporize, yet engaged with starved People,
whilst he had abundance of Provisions, and the conveniency of the Sea.
Though these two Men had often been in many perillous occasions, yet they
were never wounded, but they murdered themselves as they had murdered
<hi>Caesar,</hi> and so received punishment for the crime they had committed. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
finding <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Body, covered it with a Purple <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>obe, and after having
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65196:246"/>
burned it, sent the Ashes to <hi>Servilia</hi> his Mother; his Army which yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
of fourteen thousand Men, as soon as they knew of his death sent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
to <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony,</hi> who having pardoned them, divided them
betwixt them. Soon after, those that were in the Forts yielded likewise,
but on condition that the Plunder both of the Forts and the Camp should be
the Prize of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s and <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Soldiers. As for the persons of Note
and Quality who had sided with <hi>Brutus,</hi> some fell in the Fight, others like
their Generals slew themselves, and others forced their deaths from their
Enemies hand, of which number were <hi>L. Cassius</hi> Nephew to the General,
and the Son of the famous <hi>Cato</hi> of the same name, who several times threw
himself into the midst of his Enemies, and at last took off his Head-piece,
either that he might be the easier known, or the easier killed, or both: <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beo</hi>
known for his wisdom, and for being Father to that <hi>Labeo</hi> to this day
holding a prime degree among the famous Doctors of Law, caused a hole
to be dug in his Tent, to the proportion of his Body, and after having given
his Orders to his Servants, and writ to his Wife and Children Letters, which
he gave to his Slaves to carry, took by the Right Hand one of the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of them, and having made him walk round about him, according to the
Roman custom when they enfranchise a Slave, commanded him to take a
Sword, and presented him his Throat, and so made his Tent his Grave.
The Thracian <hi>Rascus</hi> brought back many People from the Mountains;
and for all the service he had done <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> asked only the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of his Brother <hi>Rascupolis,</hi> and obtained it; which was enough to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
that at the beginning of the War these Thracians had no private dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
but seeing two great Armies coming into their Country to make
War, not knowing which would have the better, one took one part, and the
other the other, that happen what would he on the conquering side might
make his Brother's composition. As for <hi>Portia Brutus</hi>'s Wife and young
<hi>Cato</hi>'s Sister, when she heard they were both in this manner lost, in spite of
all her Servants care to prevent her death, she swallowed burning Coals,
and died. Many persons of Quality being escaped to <hi>Thassa,</hi> some of them
embarqued to retire elsewhere, others with the remainder of the Army
chose <hi>Messala Corvinus</hi> and <hi>Lucius Bibulus</hi> for their Chiefs, to whom they
promised to do what they pleased; and the rest treating with <hi>Anthony</hi>'s
Men, as soon as they came to <hi>Thassa</hi> delivered into their Hands all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
Provisions, and store of other warlike Preparations. Thus by a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
boldness <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> in two Fights won the greatest Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that ever till now was gained; for never did two such Roman Armies
fight together. Nor were their Forces raised in haste out of the Citizens,
but all chosen Men, not Apprentices, but old Soldiers, experienced both
in Foreign and Civil Wars, all speaking the same Language, all exercised
in the same Military Discipline, equal in experience and valour, which
made it not easie for them to vanquish each other: besides never in any
War did so many Citizens once Friends and Comrades fight with so much
heat and courage, which is sufficiently proved in that, considering both
Battels, the Vanquisher lost not less than the Vanquished. However, <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s
and <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Men found the prediction of their Generals true; for
in one day, and one Battel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hey were not only delivered from the danger of
Famine, and the fear they were in of perishing, but this glorious Victory
gave them likewise all things in abundance, and the conceptions of many
Mens minds when they went to fight, that this day would decide the state
of the Empire, were accomplished; for the Common-wealth was never
more restored, nor was there any more need for the Citizens to come to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65196:246"/>
these extremities, except in the quarrel between <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony,</hi> which
was the last of the Civil Wars; for as to what happened in the mean time,
when after the death of <hi>Brutus, Pompey</hi> and all those who escaped from the
Defeat, having yet considerable Forces renewed the War, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
parallel to it, either for Gallantry, or affection of Cities, or Soldiers
towards their Generals, besides no persons of Quality were concerned, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did the Senate declare for them, nor had they ever such Reputation
and Glory as <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Brutus.</hi>

               <p>AFter the death of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius, Caesar</hi> went into <hi>Italy,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> into <hi>Asia,</hi> where meeting with <hi>Cleopatra</hi> Queen of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> he no sooner beheld her but he became inflamed with a
love proved ruinous to them both, and occasioned multitudes
of miseries to all <hi>Egypt,</hi> wherefore the Egyptian Affairs will
make a part of this Story, yet without bearing that Title; for I have yet
much to treat of the Civil Wars, which continued long after the death of
<hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> though without any Head or General obeyed like them,
till <hi>Sextus</hi> the youngest Son of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, who had got together
the Remains of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi>'s Party, being dead, and <hi>Lepidus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoiled
of that part of the Empire he pretended to, all the Sovereign Power
remained divided between <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony:</hi> which things passed in this
manner; <hi>Cassius</hi> sirnamed the <hi>Parmesan</hi> was left in <hi>Asia</hi> by <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:65196:248"/>
with a Fleet and an Army to officiate there as Superintendent of the
Revenues. After <hi>Cassius</hi>'s death, in hopes that the like would not happen
to <hi>Brutus,</hi> he made choice of thirty of the Rhodian Ships, which he thought
himself able to manage with Seamen and Soldiers, and burning all the rest
except the Sacred Galley, that he might deprive the Rhodians of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any thing, took the Sea with this Fleet. <hi>Clodius</hi> whom <hi>Brutus</hi> had sent
into that Island with thirteen Ships, finding it revolted (for <hi>Brutus</hi> was
slain at the time of his arrival) drew off three thousand Men that were
there in Garrison, and went to joyn with the Parmesian. <hi>Toxilus</hi> came
likewise to them with many other Ships, and all the Tribute Money he
could gather at <hi>Rhodes.</hi> To this Fleet, grown already in some measure
powerful, flocked all those dispersed throughout <hi>Asia</hi> to exercise any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
bringing with them all the Soldiers they could, and to that end ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Levies of Slaves, Captives, and the Inhabitants of the Islands where
they touched, <hi>Cicero</hi> the Orator came thither likewise, and with him all
the Persons of Quality escaped from <hi>Thassa;</hi> so that in a short time great
multitudes were assembled of considerable Forces, both by Sea and Land,
with Officers to command them. At length taking with them one <hi>Lepidus,</hi>
whom <hi>Brutus</hi> had left in <hi>Crete</hi> with some Forces for Guard of that Island,
they steered their course towards <hi>Murcus</hi> and <hi>Aenobarbus,</hi> who had a
powerful Fleet on the Ionian Seas: there dividing themselves, one part
joyned with <hi>Murcus,</hi> and went towards <hi>Sicily,</hi> which was a considerable
recruit to <hi>Pompey;</hi> and the other stayed with <hi>Aenobarbus,</hi> who designed to
form a party by himself: thus out of the ruines of <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius</hi> sprung
up two new Armies. Mean while <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> made magnificent
Sacrifices to the Gods for the Victory at <hi>Philippi,</hi> testifying their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments
to the Soldiers by praises, till they could be able to give them
the promised Rewards. To this end <hi>Caesar</hi> took his way forthwith into <hi>Italy,</hi>
undertaking the charge of distributing Land to them, and giving them
Houses, a charge which he thought the least toilsome, and fittest for him,
not being well in health, whilst <hi>Anthony</hi> went into the beyond Sea Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to get together mony to discharge their promises. After this they
made a new division of the Empire, and besides those Provinces they alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
had, parted between them those which were <hi>Lepidus</hi> his share: for <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
designed to make the Transalpine Gauls free, according to the intention
of his Father, and <hi>Lepidus</hi> was accused of holding intelligence with <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey.</hi>
However <hi>Caesar</hi> had resolved to give him other Provinces, if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
made against him proved not true. They dismissed likewise all
the Veterans, save only eight thousand Men, who desiring to continue in
the service, were shared betwixt them, and added to the Pretorian Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts.
Their Forces comprising likewise those which had quitted <hi>Brutus</hi>'s
Party, still consisted of eleven Legions, and fourteen thousand Horse, of
which <hi>Anthony,</hi> because of his Expedition, took six Legions and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Horse; so that <hi>Caesar</hi> had left him only five Legions and four thousand
Horse, with some Troops <hi>Anthony</hi> had left in <hi>Italy</hi> under the Command of
<hi>Calenus,</hi> to whom he gave order to deliver them to <hi>Caesar,</hi> instead of those
taken from him, and this done, <hi>Caesar</hi> began his March towards the Ionian
Sea.</p>

                  <hi>Anthony</hi> arriving at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> offered most magnificent Sacrifices to the
Goddess, and pardoned all those of <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi>'s Party that had taken
Sanctuary in the Temple, save only <hi>Petronius,</hi> one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators

at <hi>Laodicea.</hi> After which the Greeks and all the other Nations inhabiting

                           <p>YOu know, Gentlemen, that <hi>Attalus</hi> your King having by testament given
you to the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> you soon found our Government more easie
and more advantageous than his: for we remitted you all those Tributes you were
used to pay him, till there rising up among us some disturbers of the publick
Peace, we were forced to lay some Contributions upon you: we imposed them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, not according to your Estates, or to continue the payment of them after
the danger was past, but we taxed you only in some part of your Revenues, to
the end we might participate together in the publick charge. After which,
when the Commissioners sent by the Senate to collect them oppressed you, making
you pay more than demanded by us, <hi>C. Caesar</hi> discharged you of a third of all
the impositions, and settled orders, that no more injustice should be done you by
committing to your selves the collecting of the Moneys from the Country. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
which, that great Man to whom you were obliged being slain as a
Tyrant by our<note n="*" place="margin">By way of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony.</note> good Citizens, you have supplyed with vast Sums the Murderers
of your Benefactor against us who did all we could to revenge him. Wherefore
Fortune favouring the juster cause, and having decided it, not as you would
have had it, but according to reason, we should have punished you more rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
if you had assisted them with your Arms; but because we are willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that you have done nothing but what you were forced to, we shall deal the
more gently with you. We stand now in need of Money, of Lands, and of
Cities, to discharge our selves of the promises made to our Soldiers to reward
them after the Victory. Our Army is composed of twenty eight Legions, which,
accounting the light armed Foot, amount to one hundred and seventy thousand
Men, besides the Horse and some other Companies: you may therefore judge
what Money we are obliged to raise for so great a number of Men. As for the
Lands and Cities, <hi>Caesar</hi> is gone into <hi>Italy,</hi> to distribute them, and to speak it
in a word to change all the habitations of that people; so that to the end you be
not forced to quit your Lands, your Cities, your Houses, your Temples, and
your Sepulchres: you must furnish us with Money, but yet not all (for you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do that) but a part, and the least part too: and I believe when you know our
Demands, you will go away satisfied. You have in two years payed our Enemies
ten years Tribute, we ask no more of you; but it must be payed in a year, for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
presses us, besides we favour you, and you cannot but confess the penalty

               <p>Thus spake <hi>Anthony</hi> with design to raise Money to pay eight and twenty
Legions, though at the time of their Accommodation at <hi>Modena</hi> they
had promised rewards to three and forty complete Legions, but the War
had reduced them to that number. Scarcely had he pronounced his last
words, but the Greeks prostrating themselves upon the ground, humbly
represented to him, that after the violences they had suffered from <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> they were not worthy of punishment but pity, that they
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:65196:249"/>
would willingly have given to their Benefactors all their Goods, if they
had not been robbed of them by their Enemies, whom they had not only
been forced to furnish with all their stamped Money, but likewise to deliver
up all their Plate and Goldsmiths Work to be by them coined. At length
they prevailed with him that they should only pay nine years Tribute in two
years; and besides this Taxes were layed upon the Kings, Potentates and
free Cities according <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o their Estates. As he went from Province to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
<hi>Lucius</hi> Brother to <hi>Cassius,</hi> and all who were afra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d of him hearing of his
clemency at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> came to ask pardon. He forgave all save only those who
had a hand in the Conspiracy against <hi>Caesar,</hi> for to them he remained implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
He comforted those Cities had sustained the greatest losses, exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Lycians from Tribute, exhorted the Xanthians to rebuild their City,
gave the Rhodians <hi>Andros, Tino, Naxos</hi> and <hi>Mynda,</hi> which soon after he
again took from them because they used them hardly, he declared those of
<hi>Laodicea</hi> and <hi>Tharsus</hi> free and exempt from all Impositions, and by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
which he caused to be proclaimed, discharged from servitude all the
Thracians had been sold. The Athenians coming to wait upon him, he
gave them first <hi>Tino,</hi> then <hi>Egina, Icono, Zea, Sciatha</hi> and <hi>Pararetha.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which passing through <hi>Phrygia, Mysia, Galatia, Cappadocia, Cilicia,</hi>
the Lower <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Palestine,</hi> he charged them with great Impositions.
To whatever place he came he took cognisance of all differences between
the Cities and the Kings. As in <hi>Cappadocia</hi> between <hi>Sysinnus</hi> and <hi>Ariara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,</hi>
where he adjudged the Kingdom to <hi>Sysinnus</hi> for his Mother <hi>Glaphyra</hi>'s
sake, who was very beautiful. And in <hi>Syria,</hi> whence he expelled all the
Tyrants who had set themselves up in every City.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Being in <hi>Cilicia, Cleopatra</hi> came to him, to whom having complained,
that she had not assisted <hi>Caesar,</hi> she made no other excuse, but that at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the War she had sent four Legions to <hi>Dolobella,</hi> that afterwards
having fitted out a Fleet, she was prevented by Tempests, and the sudden
death of that young Consul. That though <hi>Cassius</hi> had twice with threats
demanded her assistance, she had refused it. That when they were upon
the Ionian Sea, she was her self embarqued upon a magnificent Fleet, to
come and joyn with them, without any consideration either of <hi>Cassius</hi> or
<hi>Murcus</hi>'s Naval Power, but that bad weather and other losses with her own
sickness had made her return into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where she received news of the
Victory. Here <hi>Anthony,</hi> wounded in the very soul by the charms of this
Queen, became as foolishly in love as if he had been a young Man, though
he were now above forty years of age. True it is, he is reported to have
always had a natural inclination for this passion, and that formerly when
she was but a child he conceived a love for her, having seen her at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
when he served under <hi>Gabinius</hi> as General of the Horse. <hi>Anthony</hi>
therefore all upon a sudden neglecting the care of his Affairs, <hi>Cleopatra</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed
of all things at her pleasure, without considering either reason or
justice, insomuch that <hi>Arsinoe</hi> her Sister having taken Sanctuary at <hi>Miletum</hi>
in the Temple of <hi>Diana Leucophryna, Anthony</hi> sent some thither who slew
her, and commanded the Tyrians to deliver up to <hi>Cleopatra, Serapion</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who was fled into the Sanctuary at <hi>Tyre,</hi> because he had
taken
part with <hi>Cassius;</hi> and gave the same order to the Aradians, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
another who had fled for refuge into their City, because the Brother of
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> overcome by <hi>Caesar</hi> in a Naval Engagement on the <hi>Nile,</hi> being
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:65196:249"/>
seen no more, this unhappy Man had told the Aradians, that he was <hi>Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;</hi>
and at last ordered the Ephesians to bring before him <hi>Megabyzes</hi> the
High Priest of <hi>Diana,</hi> because he had received <hi>Arsinoe</hi> as a Queen; but the
Ephesians having besought <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in his behalf, pardoned him. Thus
in a short time might a strange change be perceived in <hi>Anthony</hi>'s spirit,
caused by that passion which was the beginning and end of all those mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
afterwards befel him: for after <hi>Cleopatra</hi>'s return to <hi>Egypt</hi> he sent his
Horse to <hi>Palmyra</hi> a City near the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> to sack it; his pretence for
doing it being very slight, for he could accuse the Inhabitants of nothing,
but that being situated between the Dominion of the Romans and that of
the Parthians, they strove to accommodate themselves the best they could
with one and t'other; and indeed it was a City of Trade, through which
were transported from <hi>Persia</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> all the commodities of <hi>India</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia,</hi>
but his main design was to enrich his Cavalry. The Palmyrians fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
it, had caused all they had of value to be carried to the other side of
the River, on the Banks of which they planted good Archers to defend the
approach, (for there are the best Archers of the world) so the Cavalry
finding not a person in the City, returned without drawing their Swords, or
making any purchase. The Parthian War which happened soon after,
seems from hence to have taken its brith, many of the Tyrants of <hi>Syria</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
retired with them: for <hi>Syri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> till the time of <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Pious, and
his Son of the same name, had been governed by Kings of the race of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus
Nicator</hi> (as we have already said, writing the Affairs of <hi>Syria</hi>) but
this Province being reduced by <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Arms, he placed therein <hi>Scaurus</hi>
for Governonr, to whom the Senate sent others for Successors, among
whom was <hi>Gabinius</hi> who went to make War against the People of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria:</hi>
to <hi>Gabinius</hi> succeeded <hi>Crassus,</hi> who was slain by the Parthians, and after
him <hi>Bibulus.</hi> At length after the death of <hi>C. Caesar,</hi> during these troubles
which were almost universal, there rose up in every City Tyrants, support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Parthians; for after <hi>Crassus</hi>'s misfortune they had spread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into <hi>Syria,</hi> and had intelligence with the Tyrants, which <hi>Anthony</hi>
now forced to retire to them, whom after he had expelled, charged the
People with Imposts, and made this impertinent attempt upon the Palmyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
he took <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o farther care how to appease the troubles wherein he beheld the
Province, and put his Army in Garrison, and went to find out <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> where being magnificently received, he spent the Winter, without
any mark of Command, both habited and living like a private Man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because he was in a Country dependant on another, and in the Royal
City, or that he might the more pleasantly pass away the time whilst Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
lasted: for he banished all manner of care, and dispensed with the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
put off his usual habit to wear a square Robe after the Greek Fashion,
with white Attick Hose, such as are worn by the Priest's of <hi>Athens</hi> and of
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> which they call <hi>Phaecasion,</hi> and only visited the Temples, Schools,
and Philosophy Assemblies, holding conversation with none but the Greeks
in service of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> for whose sake alone he had undertook this Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
               <p>Mean while, <hi>Caesar</hi> going to <hi>Rome</hi> was very much distempered in Body,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
especially at <hi>Brundusium,</hi> where the danger was so great, that a report was
raised of his being dead: but at length by degrees the Distemper diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he entred the City, where shewing <hi>Anthony</hi>'s orders to those who had
charge of his Affairs, they presently signified to <hi>Calenus,</hi> that he should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
to him the two Legions, and wrote to <hi>Sextus</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi> to surrender up
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65196:250"/>
the Province, which was performed. After which <hi>Caesar</hi> finding that <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus</hi>
was not guilty of what he had been charged with, quitted to him <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi>
instead of those Provinces that had been taken from him, and exposed
to sale what were left of the Goods of the Proscribed. But when it came to
the point of sending Soldiers to Colonies, and giving them Lands, many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
presented themselves. The Soldiers pretended they ought to give
them the best Cities of all <hi>Italy,</hi> according to the promise made them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the War. And the Cities demanded that all <hi>Italy</hi> should contribute to
this charge, or that others should draw lots with them, and that for the
Lands the Generals should pay the purchase; but there was no Money in
the Treasure. There were dayly to be seen coming to <hi>Rome</hi> young and
old, Women and Children, who assembling in the great place, or in the
Temples, with tears in their eyes cryed out: That being Italians, without
having committed any fault, they were driven from their Lands, and their
Houses, as if it had been a conquered Country. The Romans had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
on them, and their deplorable condition drew tears from a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of People, especially when they considered that this War had not
been undertaken for the publick good, but to satisfie the ambition of the
Chiefs, who had no other aim than the seising of the Empire. Besides,
they were sensible, that they gave not the Soldiers the recompense promised
after the Victory, nor sent them into Colonies with any other intent, but
that the Common-wealth should never more get Head again, the Usurpers
of the Government having so many People, obliged by their good turns,
ready to take up Arms at their first command. <hi>Caesar</hi> made excuse to the
Cities from the necessity constraining these things, telling them withal he
was much afraid the Soldiers would not be so content neither. And indeed
they were not content; for they oppressed their Neighbours, and took not
only more than the Lands set out to them, but likewise the best they could
pick out. And in vain did <hi>Caesar</hi> reprove them, or gave them other things
to hinder them from these violences; for their Generals standing in need of
them to secure their Dominions, they stood but in little awe. Moreover,
the five years of the Triumvirate drawing to an end, they stood in each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
assistance for their common security, the Generals, that by the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
means they might keep their Command, and the Soldiers, that by
their means they might keep possession of what had been given them; for
all their hopes being that the grant would stand good so long as the Donors
were Masters of the Empire, they were concerned to attempt any thing for
the maintenance of their power: wherefore <hi>Caesar</hi> gave many other gifts
to the maimed Soldiers, borrowing for this purpose Money from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
which increased the affection of the Soldiery to him, who found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
obliged by his having gratified them with Cities, Land, Money and
Houses. Those who were despoiled of all these things made great cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and continuall railed against him, but however they affronted him,
he bore all to content the Soldiery.</p>

                  <hi>Lucius</hi> Brother to <hi>Anthony</hi> now Consul, <hi>Fulvia</hi> his Wife, and <hi>Manius,</hi>
who had the charge of his Affairs in his absence, observing <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and to the end that all might not seem to be his doings, or the whole

to <hi>Anthony</hi>'s prejudice, used all the artifices possible, to delay the sending
the Soldiers to the Colonies, till his return out of <hi>Asia:</hi> but when
they could not succeed in that design, because of the earnestness of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65196:250"/>
Forces. By the agreement made with <hi>Caesar</hi> he had quitted to him
the employment, but they denyed it, and <hi>Fulvia</hi> going her self to the Head
of the Legions with <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Children, besought them not to suffer their
General to be deprived of the Glory and satisfaction to testifie his good will
to them: besides, <hi>Anthony</hi>'s reputation was very great among the Soldiery,
and high in esteem with all the world; for <hi>Caesar</hi> being sick at the time of
the Battel at <hi>Philippi,</hi> all the honour of that Victory seemed due only to
<hi>Anthony.</hi> Though <hi>Caesar</hi> saw well this was a violation of their agreement,
yet in favour to his Associate in the Empire, he consented, and so they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
the Legions to their Colonies, where they committed strange disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
for that <hi>Caesar</hi> might not seem more indulgent than those who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
them, they gave them all manner of License. Many Cities neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
on those where they had Lands set out, having received much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
came to complain to <hi>Caesar,</hi> telling him, that the Colonies were
much more injust than the Proscriptions; for they proscribed only
their Enemies, whereas by means of the Colonies multitudes of innocent
persons were ruined, <hi>Caesar</hi> was not ignorant of the injuries done, but he
could not remedy them, for he had no Money to pay the old Proprietors
the purchase of their Lands, and he would not delay the recompence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to their Forces, because of the Wars they were still engaged in:
<hi>Pompey</hi> was powerful at Sea, and able to strave the City by cutting off Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions:
<hi>Aenobarbus</hi> and <hi>Murcus</hi> were fitting out another Fleet, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Army; so that if <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> performed not their promise, they
had reason to fear they should be but ill served by their Soldiers. Add to
which that the five years of the Triumvirate was near expired, and they
had therefore still more reason to gain the good will of the Army; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they passed by many things patiently, and seemed as if they did not see
their insolencies; till such time that one day as <hi>Caesar</hi> was at the Theatre, a
Soldier who could get no room in the place appointed for them, had the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
to go seat himself with the Roman Knights. The People having
observed it, <hi>Caesar</hi> caused him to be taken away, whereat the rest were so
enraged, that when the Plays were done, gathering about <hi>Caesar</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
their companion, because not having seen him afterwards they
thought him dead. The Soldier coming in at the same time they imagined
him brought out of Prison, and though he denyed it, and told them
the matter as it passed, they told him he lyed, had been suborned, and was
a Traytor to betray his Comrades. Such was their insolence in the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
as a consequence to which, he having appointed them a day for their
meeting in the Field of <hi>Mars,</hi> for the division of Lands, they were so hasty
that they came thither long before day-light. And fretting at <hi>Caesar</hi> that he
came not so soon as they thought fit, <hi>Nonius</hi> a Centurion freely reproving
them, and representing to them the respect they oughtto their General, who
made them not wait out of any pride or scorn, but because he was sick,
they began to rail at him, and call him flatterer, and by degrees their fury
increasing, proceded to affront and throw stones as him. He thereupon fled,
they pursued him, he threw himself into the River to make his escape,
but there they killed him, and drawing his Body out of the Water, brought
it and layd it in the way by which <hi>Caesar</hi> was to pass. His Friends here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
counselled him not to go and expose himself to these Bedlams, but
lest absence might more increase their fury, he went, and seeing <hi>Nonius</hi>'s
Body, turned off by another way. There as if this had been the crime
only of some particular Men, he exhorted them for the future to spare one
another, made division of their Lands, permitted those had done good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65196:251"/>
to demand the usual rewards, and gave them likewise even against his
own judgment, to many that were unworthy, insomuch that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
admiring his gravity, began to repent and be ashamed, and withal to
demand that those guilty of <hi>Nonius</hi>'s death might be punished, upon
which he told them he knew them well, but that he was content with their
confession and repentance, and would remit the punishment. Thus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obtained not only pardon for their fault, but likewise gifts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
they all upon a sudden changed their anger into applause and accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations.
These two examples chosen among many others make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
appear how difficult it is, to govern in such times as those the spirits
of the Soldiery, which is occasioned when Generals are not commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Command of their Armies by lawful Authority and Nomination
as ordinarily happens in Civil Wats, and when Armies are not raised ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to ancient custom, for the service of their Country. And in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
all those People bore not Arms for the Roman People, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had set them on foot, not by order of War, but by private promises, not
against the Enemies of the State, but to satisfie particular animosities, not
against Strangers, but against Citizens their Equals in Birth and Dignity:
all these things ruined Military Discipline. The Soldiers conceited not they
made War, but did service to particular persons that would oblige them,
and from whom they hoped for acknowledgments, and the Commanders
made use of them as they had occasion for their own advantage. And
whereas the ancient Romans never pardoned any Runaways, they now
gave them rewards; for the Pleas were equally specious, each party deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the other Enemy to the State, the Leaders themselves making the same
pretence, and all saying they had no other end than the service of their
Country. Thus the Soldiers were his, gave most; as well as whole Armies
and many illustrious persons, thought they did not deserve the name of Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways,
which things caused often shifting of sides; for on what ever par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they ranged themselves, they still served their Country: wherefore the
Generals that were sensible of this, were fain to wink at many things, and
confided not so much in the fidelty of their Soldiers, or the authority of
the Laws, as in the power of their Largesses, so ordinary were tumults
and mutinies now in Armies.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> Mean while <hi>Rome</hi> was distressed for want of Provisions; for <hi>Pompey</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the bringing any by Sea, and in <hi>Italy</hi> they had almost given over Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry,
because of the continual Wars, and that little Corn there was the
Armies consumed. There were likewise committed in the Cities many
Robberies and Violences by night, after which no inquest was made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they layd all upon the Soldiers; wherefore the People shut up their
Shops, and drove away the Magistrates, as standing no more in need of
Officers or Artificers in a miserable City, where all things were exposed to
Robbery and Plunder: <hi>Lucius</hi> a Lover of the publick wellfare, and Enemy
to the power of the Triumvirate, which seemed to last beyond the time
prescribed by its establishment, had often sharp words with <hi>Caesar;</hi> and
when the old Proprietors of Lands came to complain to the Magistrates of
the oppression of the Soldiery, he alone would hear their complaints, and
promise them his protection, and they on the other side engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to serve him in what ever he would employ them. This gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Soldiers, and to <hi>Caesar</hi> himself, to reproach him that he bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
himself against his Brother, and to give advice to <hi>Fulvia</hi> to have a care
of kindling an unseasonable War. Notwithstanding which <hi>Manius</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65196:251"/>
cunning, having buzzed in her ears, that as long as <hi>Italy</hi> was in
peace her Husband would stay with <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> but if once there were War
would presently come away, she suffered her self to be perswaded, and
out of her womanly passion obliged <hi>Lucius</hi> to seek some occasion of a
Rupture. To which effect <hi>Caesar</hi> being gone to settle the rest of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
she sent along <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Children together with <hi>Lucius,</hi> that it might
not be thought he alone had the authority. And he happening to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
some part of his Cavalry to march speedily to the Sea Coast of the
Brutians, lest <hi>Pompey</hi> should plunder them, <hi>Lucius</hi> either fearing or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
that he was afraid these Horse were drawn off against him and his
Nephews, fled forthwith to <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Colonies, desiring of them Guards
for his security, accusing <hi>Caesar</hi> of infidelity towards their General: <hi>Caesar</hi>
on the contrary sent to tell them that there was no shadow of change in the
Friendship betwixt them and <hi>Anthony,</hi> but that <hi>Lucius</hi> sought a pretence to
make them arm against each other, because he was an Enemy to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirate
in the maintenance of whose power the Soldiery were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
if they would not be driven from their Colonies, and that for his
Horse they were still in the Country of the Brutians executing his orders.
The principal Officers of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Army understanding well all these
things met together at <hi>Theana</hi> with <hi>Caesar,</hi> where a Treaty was made on
these conditions: That the Triumvirs should not disturb the Consuls in the
Government of the Common-wealth; that they should give Lands only to
those had served at <hi>Philippi:</hi> that <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Forces in <hi>Italy</hi> should as well as
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s have a share of the Proscripts Money, and in the produce of the sale
lately made of their Goods: that for the future no one should constrain
them to serve out of <hi>Italy,</hi> except two Legions which <hi>Caesar</hi> might employ
in the Expedition against <hi>Pompey:</hi> that those <hi>Caesar</hi> should send to <hi>Spain</hi>
might pass the <hi>Alpes</hi> without being impeded by <hi>Asinius Pollio,</hi> and that
<hi>Lucius</hi> satisfied with these conditions should dismiss his Guards, and follow
the functions of his authority with all security. These Articles being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon by the Officers of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Army, there were but two of them
executed, and <hi>Salvidienus</hi> passed the <hi>Alpes</hi> in spite of those would have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
him: insomuch that the performance of the rest being delayed, <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
retired to <hi>Praeneste,</hi> saying, that having no Guards, he was afraid of
<hi>Caesar,</hi> who was always accompanied with Soldiers, because of his quality
of Triumvir. <hi>Fulvia</hi> likewise fled for refuge to <hi>Lepidus,</hi> out of fear, as
she said, for her Children, and she had a better opinion of him than of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar.</hi>
However it were, both one and the other wrote to <hi>Anthony,</hi> and some
of their Friends who could lay open all the Affair carried the Letters, of
which I could not find the Copies, though I have made a curious search. Things
standing in this posture, the principal Officers of both Armies met together
to terminate the differences yet between their Generals by an equitable
judgment, resolved to force to a compliance those that would not submit,
and they invited <hi>Lucius</hi> his Friends to joyn with them; upon their refusal,
<hi>Caesar</hi> to render them odious, began to vent his complaints in all places as
well to the Officers of the Armies, as the principal Citizens, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
a great many persons to go from the City to <hi>Lucius,</hi> to beseech him
to have compassion of <hi>Italy,</hi> almost ruined by Civil Wars, and to make
choice of some, who, with them, or with the Officers might endeavour an
accommodation. <hi>Lucius</hi> had both a respect for them and the matter
whereof they spoke. But <hi>Manius</hi> answered fiercely, that whilst <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
amused himself to raise Money among Strangers, <hi>Caesar</hi> by
his cringing and flexibility secured to himself all the Militia, and all
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:65196:252"/>
the strong places of <hi>Italy.</hi> That to this purpose, to the damage of <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
to whom <hi>Gaul</hi> appertained, he had enfranchised it, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ighteen Cities designed to reward the Veterans, he had granted
them almost all <hi>Italy,</hi> and that whereas Lands were due only to twenty
eight Legions that had served, he had given to four and thirty; that he
had taken Money out of the Temples, which had never before been done
whatever Famine were in the City, and that on pretence of a War against
<hi>Pompey,</hi> but indeed to gain himself Soldiers to employ against <hi>Anthony:</hi>
besides he had appraised the Proscripts Goods at such low rates, that it was
rather giving than selling them: wherefore if he really desired peace, he
ought first to give an account of what he had done, and do nothing for the
future but what should be resolved upon common deliberation. Thus <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
by this arrogant answer would have had <hi>Caesar</hi> no more to have the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement
of any thing, but that the agreement made between him and <hi>Anthony</hi>
(by which each had an absolute power in things whereof he took
charge, and what one did the other was to approve) should be utterly
void. Wherefore <hi>Caesar</hi> seeing they were absolutely determined for War,
began to prepare likewise. Two Legions that were in the City of <hi>Ancona</hi>
having advice hereof, they having formerly belonged to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and since
to <hi>Anthony,</hi> and having still respect for both, sent Deputies to <hi>Rome</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
them to consent to an Accommodation: whereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> answering
that he had no design against <hi>Anthony,</hi> but that <hi>Lucius</hi> would make War
upon him, the Deputies and Officers of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Forces joyned together,
deputed some to <hi>Lucius,</hi> to perswade him to admit of a determination of
the Differences between <hi>Caesar</hi> and him, by the way of Justice, letting
him know, that if he would not submit, they would take the matter into
their own hands. After having obtained of <hi>Lucius</hi> what they desired, the
City of <hi>Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Praeneste,</hi> where Benches were set up for the Judges, and
two Tribunals, from whence to plead Causes: <hi>Caesar</hi> who came first had
sent some Horse on the way which <hi>Lucius</hi> was to come, to discover if there
were no Ambush; these met with some of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Horse which <hi>Lucius</hi>
had likewise sent to scout before, and flew some of them: <hi>Lucius</hi> retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereupon for fear (as he said) of Ambushes, and never afterwards
notwithstanding all the prayers of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Officers, and all their assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
to be his safe conduct, would return, so that those who laboured for
Peace, not succeeding, it came to an open War, and they began already to
tear one another in pieces by bloody Declarations. <hi>Lucius</hi>'s Forces were
composed of four Legions he had raised when he entred into the Consulate,
besides the eleven Legions of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s commanded by <hi>Calenus,</hi> and all
those were in <hi>Italy:</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> had four Legions at <hi>Capua</hi> and his Pretorian
Cohorts with six Legions <hi>Salvidienus</hi> brought him from <hi>Spain.</hi> For Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<hi>Anthony</hi>'s Provinces where there was no War, furnished <hi>Lucius;</hi>
and <hi>Caesar</hi> drew from all his except <hi>Sardinia,</hi> at present engaged in War,
and borrowed from all the Temples with promise to pay the interest, till he
restored it to the Temple of the Capitol in <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Antium,</hi> at <hi>Lavinia,</hi>
at the<note n="*" place="margin">Of <hi>Aryci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a,</hi> where was the Nymph <hi>Aegeria.</hi>

store of consecrated Treasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> Nor were all things quiet out of <hi>Italy,</hi> for <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Force and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was much increased by the Procripts, the old Inhabitants of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and even by this breach with <hi>Lucius;</hi> for all those who either feared
their own safety, or were despoiled of their goods, or had any dislike to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:65196:252"/>
the present state of Affairs, flocked in to him; besides a great number of
Youth, who sought their Fortune by War, and thought it indifferent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
under one or another General, since they were all Romans came in
to him, as judging his cause the more just: Besides he was grown rich with
Prizes taken at Sea, and had store of Shipping with all things necessary;
<hi>Murcus</hi> likewise had brought him two Legions with fourscore Ships, and
there was coming to him another Army from <hi>Cephalonia,</hi> which makes
some think that if he had now invaded <hi>Italy,</hi> he might easily have become
Master of it, oppressed, as it was, with Famine, and rent in pieces with
Intestine Divisions: but <hi>Pompey</hi> by an inexcusable imprudence chose rather
to defend himself, than assail others, which proved in the end his own loss.
As for what happened in <hi>Africa, Sextus,</hi> Lieutenant to <hi>Anthony,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Lucius</hi> Command, had delivered up his Army to <hi>Fagio, Caesar</hi>'s
Lieutenant, afterwards having received Orders again to withdraw it; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Fagio</hi>'s refusal to return it, he declared War against him, and having
raised considerable Forces of disbanded Soldiers and Africans, with such
assistance as he had from the Kings of that Country, goes to charge the
Enemy, cuts in pieces the two Wings of his Army, and makes himself
Master of his Camp; so that <hi>Fagio</hi> despairing, and thinking he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed,
slew himself. Thus <hi>Sextus</hi> repossessed himself of both the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>Bocchus,</hi> King of the Moors, by <hi>Lucius</hi> perswasion
went to make War against <hi>Carinas,</hi> who commanded in <hi>Spain</hi> for <hi>Caesar.</hi>
On the other side <hi>Aenobarbus,</hi> with seventy Ships, two Legions, a great
number of Archers and Slingers, some light armed Infantry, and Gladia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
cruising on the Ionian Sea, wasted all those Coasts that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
the Triumvirate; and coming nigh to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> took part of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s
Galley's, burnt others, and having forced the Inhabitants to shut
themselves up within their Wall, spoiled their Country. <hi>Caesar</hi> sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one Legion, and commanded <hi>Salvidienus</hi> to hasten out of <hi>Spain,</hi>
whilst both persons laboured to raise men in <hi>Italy,</hi> where there happened
some fights, some skirmishes, and many surprises. The people had a
far greater inclination for <hi>Lucius</hi>'s, then for the adverse party, because they
made War against the new Colonies, and not only the Cities, whose
Lands they had divided to the Soldiers, declared for him; but likewise all
<hi>Italy,</hi> who feared the like oppression; so those that <hi>Caesar</hi> had sent to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the consecrated Mony, being driven out of the Cities, and some of
them slain, the Inhabitants became Masters of their Walls, and declared
for <hi>Lucius.</hi> But if these took his part, the new Possessors of Lands sided
with <hi>Caesar,</hi> as if both one and the other had only regarded their proper
interests. Affairs standing thus, <hi>Caesar</hi> assembled in the Palace the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and Roman Knights, and thus spoke to them.</p>

                  <hi>Caesar</hi> having said these words, they sent forthwith to <hi>Lucius</hi> to <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neste,</hi>
who made them no answer, but that blows had already been struck
on both sides, and that <hi>Caesar</hi> deceived them, having already sent a Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> to hinder <hi>Anthony's</hi> landing, besides <hi>Manius</hi> showed
them a Letter from <hi>Anthony,</hi> whether true or forged is uncertain, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
them to defend his Authority by Arms, whereupon the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Senate demanding, if any had invaded <hi>Anthony</hi>'s; for if so they
would make them do reason by ways of Justice. <hi>Manius</hi> thereupon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
many other things, so they went away without doing any thing;
yet they went not together to return <hi>Caesar</hi> any answer of their Legation,
whether they had given him an account of it privately, or that they were
ashamed, or for some other reason.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> Thus War being declared, <hi>Caesar</hi> took the Field, leaving <hi>Lepidus</hi> with
two Legions for guard of the City, at which time many persons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
declared their dislike of the Triumvirs, by going over to <hi>Lucius.</hi>
Now what passed most considerable in this War was thus: Two of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
his Legions quartered at <hi>Alba</hi> mutined, and having turned away their
Officers, were upon the very point of revolting, when both <hi>Lucius</hi> and
<hi>Caesar</hi> were upon their way thither; <hi>Lucius</hi> got there first, and by the
force of Money and Promises, kept them in their Duty. After which, as
<hi>Firmius</hi> brought him another Army, <hi>Caesar</hi> fell upon his Rear-guard, and
forced <hi>Firmius</hi> to an Eminence; from whence escaping the next night
into a City of his faction, called <hi>Sentia; Caesar</hi> would not pursue him, for
fear of an Ambush, but on the morrow besieged the place and the Army.
On the other side <hi>Lucius</hi> having a design upon <hi>Rome,</hi> sent before three
Regiments, who with wonderful diligence entred the City privately by
night, himself followed with the flower of his Horse and the Gladiators,
and was received by <hi>Nonius,</hi> who having that day the guard of the Gate,
with all his Soldiers submitted to him, and <hi>Lepidus</hi> went out to meet with
<hi>Caesar; Lucius</hi> thus entred the City, assembled the people, and told them
that <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Lepidus</hi> should in few days give an account of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences
committed in their Magistracy, and that <hi>Anthony</hi> was disposed to
quit that unlawful power, to accept of the Consulate, that is to say, a
Dignity established by their Ancestors, instead of a tyrannical Dominion.
These words were received with the universal joy of the people, who
already imaginging the Triumvirate abolished, made acclamations to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
giving him the Title of Emperour. Soon after he left the City to
march against <hi>Caesar,</hi> passing by his Brother's Colonies, where he raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Body of an Army, and fortified all the Cities he found affectionate
to his Party: but <hi>Barbarius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Questor to <hi>Anthony</hi> being returned upon some
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65196:253"/>
difference he had with his General, told all Men, that he was mightily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
against those made War upon <hi>Caesar,</hi> to the ruine of their common
power, which made many that discovered not <hi>Barbarius</hi>'s deceit, desert <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
and joyn with <hi>Caesar. Lucius</hi> then marched to meet with <hi>Salvidienus,</hi>
who was coming with an Army of Gauls to <hi>Caesar,</hi> followed in the rear by
<hi>Asinius</hi> and <hi>Ventidius,</hi> two of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Lieutenants; so that he could not
well pass farther, when <hi>Agrippa,</hi> one of <hi>Caesar's</hi> best Friends, fearing lest
<hi>Salvidienus</hi> should be inclosed, went and seised upon<note n="*" place="margin">Dutchy of <hi>Milan.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Insubria,</hi> from
whence <hi>Lucius</hi> drew great Succors, thinking thereby to oblige <hi>Lucius</hi> to
turn his Arms upon him, and quit his design upon <hi>Salvidienus,</hi> who would
not fail to follow him in the rear, nor was he deceived in his imagination:
<hi>Lucius</hi> therefore frustrated in his hopes, would willingly have joyned with
<hi>Asinius</hi> and <hi>Ventidius,</hi> but <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Salvidienus</hi> lying on each side him,
sorely annoyed him, and had given good order for guarding the Straits;
when he saw himself engaged in this manner, not daring to venture a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
he retired night to <hi>Perugia</hi> a strong City, where he encamped, staying
for <hi>Ventidius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Agrippa, Salvidienus</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> himself coming in at the same
time, with the three Armies there besieged him, <hi>Caesar</hi> having speedily
drawn together all his Forces, that <hi>Lucius</hi> who was the Head of the War
might not escape him. He sent likewise some Forces towards <hi>Asinius</hi> and
<hi>Ventidius</hi> to retard their march, though they made no great haste, for they
approved not of this War, and did not well know <hi>Anthony</hi>'s mind; besides
there was jealousie between them, and being of equal Dignity each was
ambitious of the sole Command of the Army. Mean while, <hi>Lucius</hi> thus
besieged durst not hazard a Battel, being the weaker both in number and
quality of Soldiers, his Army consisting for the most part of new raised
Forces, nor durst he take the Field, or adventure a Retreat, being on all
sides so belayd; wherefore he sent <hi>Manius</hi> to <hi>Ventidius</hi> and <hi>Asinius</hi> to
hasten them to come to his relief, and gave order to <hi>Titinnius</hi> to go with
four thousand Horse to waste the Country under <hi>Caesar</hi>'s protection, that he
might oblige him to raise his Siege, whilst he shut himself up in <hi>Perugia,</hi>
resolved if he were forced to it to spend the Winter there, or at least so
much time till <hi>Ventidius</hi> came up to him with the other Army, but <hi>Caesar</hi>
presently set his Men to work on the Circumvallation, which he was forced
to make six and fifty Furlongs in circuit, because of the Hills, among which
the City is seated, from whence he drew two Lines down to the <hi>Tiber</hi> to
hinder any thing from being brought to the City. <hi>Lucius</hi> on his part cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the foot of the Hills to be fortified with Trench and Palisado like to the
Circumvallation, whilst <hi>Fulvia</hi> sent fresh dispatches to <hi>Ventidius, Asinius,
Ateius</hi> and <hi>Calenus</hi> to hasten them with all speed to his relief, and withal
raised a new Army, which she sent to him under the Command of <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
who meeting with one of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Legions on their March to the City,
cut them in pieces. As for <hi>Ventidius</hi> and <hi>Asinius</hi> doubtful of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s
mind they temporized, and yet pressed to it by <hi>Fulvia,</hi> they began to march
on and to come to disengage <hi>Lucius, Caesar</hi> together with <hi>Agrippa</hi> presently set
forward to meet them, after having placed a very good Guard before <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugia,</hi>
but they not being able to joyn <hi>Plancus,</hi> or put themselves into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight, retired one to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> the other to <hi>Rimini,</hi> and <hi>Plancus</hi> to
<hi>Spoleto;</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> having left a part of his Forces to hinder their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
returned to the Siege at <hi>Perugia.</hi> There he with all possible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
caused to be made a double Ditch of thirty Foot wide, and as many
deep, on which he raised a Rampire, with fifteen hundred Towers of
Wood, sixty Feet distant one from the other, with store of Redoubts, and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65196:254"/>
all things necessary for defence as well against the Besieged, as those that
would force his Lines; this was not done without frequent Sallies, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Engagements, wherein <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Light-armed Foot did wonders in lancing
their Javelings; but when <hi>Lucius</hi>'s Gladiators could come to a close Fight
with them, they made a great slaughter. The work being brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
the Besieged began to be afflicted with Famine, which augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from day to day, for neither <hi>Lucius</hi> nor the Inhabitants had made any
Provision of Victuals, which coming to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s knowledge, he caused the
Lines to be guarded with double care and diligence. Now on the Eve of
New-years-day, being a solemn Festival, <hi>Lucius,</hi> imagining they would not
have so much care of the Watch as ordinarily, went and stormed the Gate
of their Trenches, believing, that by opening this passage, he might gain
an entrance into the City for those other Forces he had in divers Quarters,
But the Legion then upon the Guard presently running in, and <hi>Caesar</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with the Pretorian Cohorts, <hi>Lucius</hi> after a long Fight resolutely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
was forced to a Retreat: and this happened at the same time that at
<hi>Rome,</hi> where they had layed in stores of Corn for Provision for the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, the People detesting both the Wars and the Victories, ran to all the
Magazines, and pillaged them of all the Corn. After this <hi>Ventidius</hi> and
those with him judging it shameful for them not to relieve <hi>Lucius,</hi> perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Famine, set forward to their assistance, and at first over-run those
Forces which <hi>Caesar</hi> had left to oppose their Designs, but <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Salvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dienus</hi>
coming in with a greater power, they were fearful of being sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded,
and so turned off to <hi>Fulcinia,</hi> a little City about one hundred and
sixty Furlongs from <hi>Perugia,</hi> where <hi>Agrippa</hi> having besieged them, they
gave <hi>Lucius</hi> notice of there being there, by great Fires which they kindled
in the Night time, <hi>Ventidius</hi> and <hi>Asinius</hi> were of the mind to sally out and
fight: <hi>Plancus</hi> on the contrary said they had better stay a while, for fear of
engaging themselves between <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Caesar;</hi> so the Besieged in <hi>Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi>
who had rejoyced at the first sight of the Fires, seeing their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
came not, imagined they had met with some obstacle, but when the
Fires were quite extinct, then they believed them absolutely defeated;
whereupon <hi>Lucius</hi> oppressed with Famine, would once more attempt an
Assault by night, and from the first Watch till it was light did all he could
to force the Lines, but being every where repulsed, he retreated into <hi>Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi>
where having taken an exact account of the Provision remaining, he
forbade giving any to the Slaves, whom yet he set Guards over; lest fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Enemy they should betray the extremities of the Garrison; so
that whole Troops of those poor wretches might be seen walk staggering
through the City, and as far as the Rampire, eating Grass, or green Leaves,
or whatsoever they could find; and when they were dead, <hi>Lucius</hi> caused
them to be interred very deep, lest if he should have burnt them, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
should have knowledge of it, or letting them lie, they should putresie,
and by their corrupt stench engender the Plague. But when there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no end either of Famine of Funerals, the Soldiers quite wearied out, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
<hi>Lucius</hi> they might once more attempt the Enemies Trenches, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
themselves this time to carry them, he approved their resolution, and
told them: <hi>In our last Assault we fought not so stoutly as the present occasion
and our n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ssity did require: now we have no other way but either to yield, or
if that seem worse then dying, to sight it out to the death.</hi> All of them cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageously
accepting of these conditions, they besought him to lead them on
in open day, that if there were any Cowards among them the night might
not keep them from being known. <hi>Lucius</hi> made his Sally about break of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65196:254"/>
day with a great quantity of Iron Instruments, many kind of Ladders,
Tools of all sorts to fill up the Trenches, with portable Towers to lay
Bridges over to the Walls, all kind of missile Arms, with Stones and Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
of Osiers or Wattles to throw upon the Stakes. They then began the
Assault with such fury, that they presently filled up the Ditch, passed the
Palisade, and gained the Foot of the Wall, which some laboured to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and others brought Ladders to scale, others drew close up their Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
with a wonderful contempt of their lives, though there fell upon them
Showers of Stones, of Darts, and of Leaden Bullets. They assaulted the
Lines in several places at once, so that the Enemy distracted, could not so
vigorously apply themselves to the defence of all: whereby it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in one Place <hi>Lucius</hi>'s Men having brought up a Tower, had cast their
Planks upon the Wall, where, though fighting in extreme danger, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
galled both in Front and Flank by the Enemies missile Arms, they at
length forced their way, and some of them gained the Wall, followed pell
mell by others; and possibly their despair had met with a happy success, if
the Enemy, knowing there were not many of these Machines, had not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
the most valiant of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Soldiers, to these weak and tired Men,
who soon tumbled them down the Walls, and having broken in pieces their
Machine with contempt, wounded them from above<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet with broken
Arms and wounded Bodies, their very voices almost failing them, they
still resolutely stood to it; but when they saw the Bodies of those who had
been slain upon the Wall stripped and thrown after them, the contumely
seemed unsufferable, and they stood like Men struck dumb, or like Wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
at the Gymnick Games that would breath themselves a while: so that
<hi>Lucius</hi> seeing them in this condition, took compassion on them, and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Retreat. However, when <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Soldiers, joyful for their success,
made a great noise with their Arms as a mark of Victory, they reentred
with fury, and bringing out Ladders (for they had no more Towers) in
a desperate mood attempted to scale the Wall, but all in vain, and indeed
it was impossible; wherefore <hi>Lucius</hi> running about to all places, besought
them not to cast themselves away, and brought them off weeping, and
much against their wills. After this fierce Assault, <hi>Caesar,</hi> to prevent the
Enemies from making the like upon his Trenches, lined his Walls with
Courts of Guard, giving order that at the first signal they should mount the
Rampire, some in one place, and some in others: and this they did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
though none assailed them, with design to exercise the Soldiers,
and strike terrour into the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Mean while <hi>Lucius</hi>'s Soldiers began to be quite out of heart, and to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/>
their Guards, as it often happens after such unfortunate repulses; and
many, not only of the Soldiers, but Officers went and submitted themselves
to <hi>Caesar. Lucius</hi> himself, touched with pity to see so many Men so miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
ending their lives, would willingly have consented to an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if he had not had with him some particular Enemies of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s, who
were fearful to fall into his hands; but when it was known that he kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the very Runaways, all Mens minds grew more inclinable to peace, so
that <hi>Lucius</hi> fearing, left if he alone resisted, they would deliver him to
<hi>Caesar;</hi> wherefore, seeing some appearance of hopes, he thus spoke to his
Army:</p>

                              <hi>I</hi> Had a design, Fellow Soldiers, to restore my Country to liberty, seeing the
Triumvirate changed into a Tyranny, and that this Authority thought to
be only established against <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> continued yet after their deaths;
for <hi>Lepidus</hi> being deprived of his part of the Empire, whilst <hi>Anthony</hi> is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
up Money in the remote Provinces, this Man who besieges us disposes all
things at pleasure, and the Roman Laws, which he makes a mock of, serve him
but for a pretence: but when to remedy this disorder, and redeem the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
from Slavery, I requested that after having given the promised Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses
to the Soldiery he should lay down the Sovereign Authority, not obtaining
it by request, I sought to constrain it according to the power invested in me by
the quality of Consul, but he raised a report among the Soldiers that I opposed
the Colonies in favour of the ancient possessors: it was a long time ere I knew he
slandered me in this manner; and when it was told me, I could not believe it,
since I had my self appointed Commissioners to divide the Lands among you: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
the greater part giving ear to this Calumny, joyned themselves with
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s Faction to make War upon us; but have made War against themselves, as
time will make it appear. For your part I am your witness, that having adhered to
the juster cause you have suffered infinitely, and at last we are not overcome by
our Enemies, but by Famine, which has forced our Officers to desert us. True
it is, it would be much for my Glory to fight for my Country, even to the last
extremities, and my good will would be recompensed with immortal praises, but
I cannot resolve it, out of my affection to you whose safety I prefer before my
own Glory. I will therefore send Deputies to the Conquerour to desire him
to deal as he please with me, so he will but pardon you who are his Fellow
Citizens, and have been his Soldiers, who have committed no fault in fighting
for a cause so apparently just, and who have not been overcome by Arms, but by
want of Provisions.</p>

               <p>After these words, he chose three out of the principal Men of his Army,
and sent them to <hi>Caesar,</hi> which drew tears from the eyes of all the rest, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring
either their own, or their Generals condition, who having such noble
and generous thoughts for his Country was yet reduced to that shameful
necessity. The three Deputies represented to <hi>Caesar,</hi> that they were all of the
same Country, had formerly fought under the same Colours, that the Chief
of both Parties had been good Friends, and that he ought to imitate the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity
of the Ancients, who were haters of deadly dissentions, with
many other things tending to the same purpose. <hi>Caesar</hi> who well knew the
Army was composed of Veterans and new raised Soldiers, cunningly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that he would pardon <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Men for their General's sake, but
for the rest they should yield upon discretion. This he spoke publickly,
but drawing apart <hi>Furnius</hi> one of the three Deputies, he gave him hopes of
a general pardon, excepting only his particular Enemies, but those who
thought themselves of that number, suspecting this private conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Furnius</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> was to their prejudice, reviled him at his return,
and besought <hi>Lucius</hi> either to obtain a general Peace, or to continue the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:65196:255"/>
War without Quarter, since it had not been undertaken for any particular
animosities, but for the Common-wealth. <hi>Lucius</hi> moved to compassion for
persons of equal quality with himself, praised their resolution, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to send other Deputies; but after saying he could find no Man fitter
for that Negotiation than himself, he went without a Herauld, only some
running before to give <hi>Caesar</hi> notice <hi>Lucius</hi> was coming. <hi>Caesar</hi> presently
came forth to meet him, and when they were in sight of each other, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by their Friends, and in the habit of Generals: <hi>Lucius</hi> stopped his Train, and taking with him only two Lictors came forward, thereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
known his intention: <hi>Caesar</hi> having observed it, imitated his Modesty,
the better to give him assurance of his future good will; and when he saw
<hi>Lucius</hi> advanced to the Trenches in token he yielded to discretion, he came
out himself, that <hi>Lucius</hi> might still be at freedom to dispose of his Affairs:
these signs of their good inclinations they by turns gave each other at their
approach: but when they were met near the Trench, after mutual saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>Lucius</hi> thus began:</p>

                              <hi>CAesar,</hi> had I made this War with Strangers, I should have thought it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/>
base to have been overcome, but much baser to have thus yielded my self,
and should soon have found a way to have freed me from that infamy; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to deal with a Citizen of my own quality, and for my Country, I think it no
shame to be vanquished in such a cause, and by such a Man: I say not this that
I would refuse to suffer what ever you please (for I come to you without a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld)
but to obtain pardon for others, which as it is just, will be no less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
to your Affairs, which to make you the more clearly understand, I will
separate my interest from theirs, that being fully perswaded I alone am the cause
of what has passed, you may discharge all your anger upon me; yet think not
whatever I say I would have offended you (that would have been unseasonable)
only let me speak, truths cannot be dissembled, I undertook this War against
you, not to seise the Sovereign Power after your defeat, but to restore to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
the Government of the Common-wealth, of which the Triumvirate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
them, since when you established it, you confessed your Government not
lawful, but necessary for a time, so long as <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> with whom you
could make no peace, subsisted. After the Heads of that Dissention were dead,
the Remains of their Party (if yet there be any Remains) being still in Arms,
not against the Common-wealth, but because they feared you, and the five years
of the Triumvirate being expired, I demanded the restoration of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
power, according to the ancient order, preferring the good of my Country
before mine own Brother, because I hoped for his consent at his return, and in
the mean time to finish the work whilst I was in authority; which had it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from you, you alone had had the Glory of it; but not being able to perswade
you, I went to the City where I thought I might by force effect it, being a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
of considerable Birth, and withal Consul. This is the sole cause of this
War, which ought neither to be attributed to my Brother, nor to <hi>Manius,</hi> nor
to <hi>Fulvia,</hi> nor to the distribution made of Lands to those Soldiers had served at
<hi>Philippi,</hi> nor to the compassion I might have conceived for those turned out of
their Beings, since I my self sent Commissioners on the places to settle my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Legions in their Colonies, and to drive out the old Proprietors: but it
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:65196:256"/>
was your invention to throw upon me and the Colonies the cause of the War,
and an artifice by which gaining the hearts of the Veterans you have got the
Victory; for being persuaded I was their Enemy, they have done all they could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me, and you had reason to make use of this policy, being in open War
with me. Now you have got the Victory, if you are an Enemy to your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
treat me likewise as an Enemy; for I had a design to serve it, if I had not
been hindred by want of Provision. These things I speak yielding my self (as
I have said) freely up, to use at your discretion, and coming alone to you, that
you may perceive what thoughts I have heretofore had of you, and what I still
preserve. Thus far touching my self: for what concerns my Friends, and all
the rest of the Army (if my advice may not be suspected by you) I will give
you what shall be for your advantage. Let me counsel you not to use them hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for any difference between us, lest, being still a Man exposed to the reach of
Fortune, you make those serve under you backward in hazarding themselves to
danger, when by your example they shall have learn'd there is no hopes of safety
but in Victory. But if the counsels of an Enemy are not to be listened to, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you not to punish my Friends for my fault, or misfortune; but rather lay
all the Load on me, who am the only cause of all that has happened. I have on
purpose left them behind me, for fear lest if I had spoke in their presence it might
have looked like an Artifice to gain favour for my self.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> In these passages <hi>Caesar</hi> admired the generous and unshaken mind of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>
so well biassed with prudence; and <hi>Lucius</hi> the great clemency and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious
brevity of <hi>Caesar,</hi> and others read in both their Faces the tenure
of what they had spoke: <hi>Lucius</hi> presently sent his Tribunes to receive or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
from <hi>Caesar,</hi> who brought him the Muster-Rolls of the whole Army,
according to the custom to this day when a Tribune comes for Orders, he
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:65196:256"/>
presents the General with a Counter-roll of those serve under him. After having received Orders, they set the Watch as before, it being <hi>Caesar</hi>'s plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
that for that night each Army should lodge in their own Camp: on
the morrow he offered Sacrifices, and <hi>Lucius</hi> sent him all his Forces in
Arms, and ready to march upon service. As soon as they came in sight of
<hi>Caesar</hi> they saluted him, calling him Emperour, and that done, drew up by
Legions the Veterans apart from the new raised Men in a place by him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.
After having performed the Ceremonies of the Sacrifices, <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
seated himself upon a Tribunal with a Wreath of Laurel on his Head,
which is the Badge of Victory, and commanded them all to lay down their
Arms, then he gave order for the Veterans to draw near, that he might
terrifie them with reproaches of ingratitude; but his mind being known,
all <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Soldiers, whether suborned, or moved with affection towards
their Fellow Citizens in distress, stepped out of their Ranks, and advancing
towards <hi>Lucius</hi>'s Men, who had formerly been their Comrades, began to

                           <p>YOu have always, Fellow Soldiers, so behaved your selves to me, that you can
ask nothing I can deny: I believe the new Soldiers may have been forced
to serve <hi>Lucius;</hi> but for those there who have so often born Arms with you, and
with whom you now petition me, I would fain ask them what injury I have done
them, or what they ever requested of me that I refused them, or what advantage
they could hope from others might oblige them to take up Arms against me, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you, and against themselves; for there is no labour to which I have not
exposed my self for settling of the Colonies, in which they are to be sharers; but
take it not amiss if their insolency make me be no further concerned for them.</p>
                           <p>But they instantly intreating him not to give over his care of them, and renewing their intreaties for their pardon.</p>
                           <p>I grant you, <hi>said he,</hi> whatever you desire, let them be pardoned, provided

               <p>Which after they had all promised, they with acclamations gave thanks
to <hi>Caesar,</hi> who permitted some of his to entertain the others as their Guests,
and ordered the multitude to encamp apart in the same place where they
had first drawn up, till such time as he appointed Cities for their Winter
Quarters, with Commissioners to conduct them. After which, before he
rose from the Tribunal, he caused to come to him <hi>Lucius,</hi> and all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Quality with him, among whom there were many Senators and
Roman Knights, all cast down, and sorrowful for this sudden and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
change, who were no sooner come out of <hi>Perugia,</hi> but a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:65196:257"/>
entred the City: when they were come before <hi>Caesar,</hi> he caused <hi>Lucius</hi>
to be set down by him, and his Friends and Centurions took charge of the
rest, after being advertised to treat them honourably, but yet to have a
care to secure their persons. He sent likewise to the People of <hi>Perugia,</hi>
who begged pardon from their Walls, to come to him without their
Senators, and he pardoned them, but their Senators were all imprisoned, and
not long after slain, except only <hi>Lucius Emulus,</hi> who being at <hi>Rome</hi> one of
the Judges of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Murderers, openly gave sentence against them, and
perswaded others to do the like, to purge the City from that abominable vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany.
<hi>Caesar</hi> had resolved to give the plunder of <hi>Perugia</hi> to his Soldiers.
But <hi>Caestius</hi> one of the Inhabitants, a crack-brained Fellow, who because
he had bore Arms in <hi>Macedon</hi> stiled himself <hi>Macedonicus,</hi> set fire to his
House, and threw himself into the Flames, which the wind driving through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole City, it was in a moment reduced to ashes, all but the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> such was the end of <hi>Perugia,</hi> a City famous for its antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for it is said to be one of those twelve Cities built by the ancient<note n="*" place="margin">Tuscans.</note> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truscans,
at their first coming into <hi>Italy,</hi> wherefore they formerly adored
<hi>Iuno</hi> after the manner of the Etruscans, but now those who divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves the ruines of the City, took <hi>Vulcan</hi> instead of <hi>Iuno</hi> for
their Tutelar Deity. The day following, <hi>Caesar</hi> passed a general pardon;
but the Army still grumbling and growing tumultuous against some, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore

<hi>Lucius,</hi> most certainly a very perillous one, and which in all likelyhood
might a long time have tormented <hi>Italy.</hi> For <hi>Asinius, Plancus, Ventidius,
Crassus, Ateius,</hi> and others of this Party, who had in all considerable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
amounting to thirteen Legions, and six thousnad five hundred Horse,
reputing <hi>Lucius</hi> the Head of this War, retired every one a several way
towards the Sea, part to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> part to <hi>Ravenna,</hi> part to <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentum,</hi>
some of which went to seek out <hi>Murcus</hi> and <hi>Aenobarbus,</hi> others
<hi>Anthony,</hi> still followed in the rere by <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Men, who offered them peace,
which they refusing, were by them much infested in their March; but
two of these Legions left by <hi>Plancus</hi> at <hi>Cameria, Agrippa</hi> gained by fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.
<hi>Fulvia</hi> likewise with her Children fled to <hi>Puzzoli,</hi> and from thence
to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> convoyed by three thousand Horse, sent her by her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's
Lieutenants. At <hi>Brundusium</hi> she embarqued on five long Ships, sent
for out of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and departed with <hi>Plancus</hi> the future companion of her
Voyage, who through cowardise deserted the rest of the Army, of
which <hi>Ventidius</hi> after took the Conduct. <hi>Asinius</hi> drew <hi>Aenobarbus</hi> to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>'s Party, which they both gave him assurance of by Letters, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was to come into <hi>Italy,</hi> they secured convenient places for his land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and laid in stores of Provision. On the other side, <hi>Anthony</hi> having
still other Forces near the <hi>Alpes</hi> commanded by <hi>Calenus, Caesar</hi> designed to
make himself Master of them, out of a jealousie he had of <hi>Anthony,</hi> to
keep them for him if he proved his Friend, or to strengthen himself against
him if it were true that he was not; but whilst he was seeking a plausible
occasion to do it, <hi>Calenus</hi> died; so that <hi>Caesar</hi> laying hold of the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
goes with all celerity and seises upon the Army, and with it of <hi>Gaul</hi>
and <hi>Spain</hi> two of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Provinces, <hi>Fulvius</hi> Son to <hi>Calenus</hi> out of fear
yielding up all without opposition. Thus <hi>Caesar</hi> being at one push strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
with eleven Legions, and these great Provinces, after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:65196:257"/>
the Commanders, and put his own Creatures in their places, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Anthony</hi> detained the Deputies of the Colonies sent to him, either <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIII"/>
because of the Winter Season, or that they might not discover his
Designs. At the beginning of Spring parting from <hi>Alexandria</hi> he came
to <hi>Tyre,</hi> from thence passing to <hi>Cyprus, Rhodes,</hi> and the Province of <hi>Asia,</hi>
he heard of the success of the Siege of <hi>Perugia,</hi> for which he blamed his
Brother, his Wife, but especially <hi>Manius.</hi> At <hi>Athens</hi> he met with <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
flying from <hi>Brundusium,</hi> and <hi>Iulia</hi> his Mother, whom <hi>Pompey</hi> (to
whom she was fled for refuge) sent upon long Ships, accompanied with
the chief Men of Quality in his Party, <hi>L. Libo</hi> his Father-in-law, <hi>Saturninus</hi>
and others, who beholding <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Magnificence, would have perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to an alliance with <hi>Pompey</hi> against <hi>Caesar:</hi> to which he answered;
<hi>That indeed he was obliged to</hi> Pompey <hi>for sending to him his Mother, which
he would acknowledge in due season; and if he must make War with</hi> Caesar,
<hi>would embrace his alliance; but if the friendship betwixt them stood firm, he
would do his endeavours to reconcile</hi> Pompey <hi>to</hi> Caesar. Thus <hi>Anthony</hi> then
answered: but when <hi>Caesar</hi> returned to the City out of <hi>Gaul,</hi> understanding
that some had sailed from <hi>Pompey</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> but not hearing what answer
they brought back, he began to make the old Soldiers and new Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the Colonies jealous of <hi>Anthony,</hi> as if <hi>Pompey</hi> were ready by his
allowance to come and driven them out, and place in their ancient possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the old Proprietors, of whom many indeed had fled to him for refuge,
which though easily believed, yet could not the affection of the Veterans to
<hi>Anthony</hi> be so easily withdrawn, so much credit had the Battel of <hi>Philippi</hi>
got him in the hearts of the Soldiers. <hi>Caesar,</hi> though he thought that he
should be stronger than <hi>Anthony, Pompey</hi> and <hi>Aenobarbus</hi> all together in
the number of Legions, for he had already above forty; yet neither ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Shipping nor time to build any, he was much afraid that if they with
five hundred Sail should come and cruise about all the Coasts of <hi>Italy,</hi> they
would in a short time starve him; wherefore though many Virgins were
offered him in Marriage he wrote to <hi>Maecenas</hi> that he should treat for him
with <hi>Scribonia</hi> Sister to <hi>Libo</hi> Father-in-law of <hi>Pompey,</hi> that by this means if
it were necessary he might make peace with <hi>Pompey:</hi> this was no sooner
known to <hi>Libo,</hi> but by Letters he gave order that the Marriage should
forthwith be concluded. Henceforwards <hi>Caesar</hi> when at any time he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a jealousie of any of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Friends or Forces under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
he sent them to several places out of the way, and <hi>Lepidus</hi> he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatched
with six of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Legions he had in some suspicion, into <hi>Africa</hi>
the Province designed for him. He sent likewise for <hi>Lucius,</hi> whom after
he praised for his piety to his Brother, that what by his orders he had
done, he would take the fault off upon himself; he yet accused him of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
that after so great an obligation he would not confess to him
what every one talked publickly; that <hi>Anthony</hi> had entred into League with
<hi>Pompey</hi> against him.</p>

                  <hi>Anthony</hi> having left <hi>Fulvia</hi> sick at <hi>Sycione,</hi> set fail from <hi>Corcyra</hi> to pass the
Ionian Sea with two hundred Ships he had built in <hi>Asia,</hi> wherein he had but
very slender Forces. Upon advice that <hi>Aenobarbus</hi> came to meet him with
a great Fleet and a mighty Army, some were jealous that he would not
prove faithful to the new made peace, because he had been condemned as
an Abettor of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s death, and therefore put in the number of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
and had taken part against <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> in the Battel of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi.</hi>
But <hi>Anthony,</hi> that he might not seem to distrust any thing, held on
his course with five of his best Ships, commanding the rest to follow at a
distance; when <hi>Aenobarbus</hi> with all his Fleet and Army were come in
sight, <hi>Plancus,</hi> who was on board of <hi>Anthony,</hi> began to be afraid, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
him to stop and send some before to make tryal of the Faith of this
doubted Man. But <hi>Anthony</hi> made answer; <hi>That he had rather perish by the
violation of a peace, than save himself by betraying the least fear.</hi> They
were now come so nigh, that they knew easily each other, and the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65196:258"/>
Ships stood Stem to Stem with their Flags aloft, when <hi>Anthony</hi>'s chief
Lictor standing on the Prow, according to custom, whether he had forgot
that they were making towards a Man, whose Faith was in some question,
and who had under his Command an Army of his own, or moved by the
customary duty of Subjects and inferiours to their Superiours, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them aloud to strike their Flag, which they obeyed, and brought up
their Ship along <hi>Anthony</hi>'s side; then the Commanders having saluted
each other, <hi>Aenobarbus</hi>'s Soldiers called <hi>Anthony</hi> Emperour, and <hi>Plancus</hi>
with much ado recovered out of his fright. <hi>Anthony</hi> having received <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobarbus</hi>
into his Ship, they sailed to <hi>Paleonta</hi> where <hi>Aenobarbus</hi>'s Land
Forces lay, where he resigned up his Tent to <hi>Anthony</hi> as his General.
From thence embarquing they sailed to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> kept with five Cohorts
for <hi>Caesar,</hi> where the Inhabitants shut their Gates against them, against
<hi>Aenobarbus</hi> as their ancient Enemy, and against <hi>Anthony</hi> for being in their
Enemies company: <hi>Anthony</hi> enraged at this refusal, and thinking it only a
pretence, and that indeed <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Men by his orders hindred his entrance,
went and seised upon the Neck of the <hi>Peninsula,</hi> drew a line cross, and
fortified it; for the City stands in a <hi>Peninsula</hi> in form of a Crescent: so that
now there was no coming to the City by Land, the Line being drawn from
one Sea to the other: he likewise raised Forts round the Port, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
spacious, and in the Islands wherewith it is encompassed, and sent along
the Coasts of <hi>Italy</hi> to seise of all commodious places, and dispatched withal
at the same time to <hi>Pompey</hi> to oblige him as much as possibly he could with
his Fleet to infest <hi>Italy.</hi> He very gladly sent <hi>Menodorus</hi> with a strong Fleet
and four Legions into <hi>Sardinia,</hi> which then held for <hi>Caesar,</hi> where he drew
two Legions to his Party, scared with the agreement between <hi>Anthony</hi>
and <hi>Pompey.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Men took <hi>Saguntum</hi> in <hi>Ausonia,</hi>
and <hi>Pompey</hi> besieged <hi>Thuria</hi> and <hi>Consentia,</hi> and sent his Horsemen into their
their Territories. <hi>Caesar</hi> assailed in so many places at once, sent <hi>Agrippa</hi> to
relieve those in <hi>Ausonia,</hi> who, passing by the Colonies, commanded the Vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans
to follow him, as if he were to lead them against <hi>Pompey;</hi> but when
they were told he acted by <hi>Anthony</hi>'s orders, they stole away every Man to
their Houses, which most of all terrified <hi>Caesar.</hi> However, he went in person
to <hi>Brundusium</hi> with another Army, and by seasonable Caresses drew the
Veterans to their duty; they now following him out of a real respect and
reverence to his person, and yet holding among themselves secret confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of reconciling him with <hi>Anthony,</hi> whom if they found obstinate, to
make War, they would then defend their General's honour, who was now
some days detained at <hi>Canusium:</hi> in Men he much outnumbred <hi>Anthony;</hi>
but when he saw <hi>Brundusium</hi> so beleaguered, that he could no way force the
Lines, he contented himself to encamp near it, to view the Enemy, and
wait a favourable occasion. Though <hi>Anthony</hi> was so well fortified in his
Trenches, that he could well have defended himself against much greater
Forces than <hi>Caesar</hi>'s, yet he sent with all speed for his Army out of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi>
and in the mean time by this stratagem amused <hi>Caesar,</hi> he sent by
night on board the long Ships and Vessels of Burthen great numbers of
Countrymen and Servants, and in the day time landed them again one
after another all armed in the sight of <hi>Caesar,</hi> as if they had been armed out
of <hi>Macedon.</hi> And now his Machines being in a readiness, he began his
Batteries upon <hi>Brundusium,</hi> to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s great grief, who could no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the place, when towards the Evening news was brought to both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:65196:259"/>
but when he heard that <hi>Servilius</hi> with twelve hundred Horse was gone over
to <hi>Caesar,</hi> he could not contain himself, but rising from Supper he mounted
with such of his Friends as were in a readiness, and accompanied only by
four hundred Horse with a singular boldness beat up the Quarters of fifteen
hundred near <hi>Uria,</hi> and so surprised them, that they yielding, he brought
them the same day before <hi>Brundusium,</hi> such an opinion of his being invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
had the Battel of <hi>Philippi</hi> got him. The Pretorian Soldiers height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
by this success, went afterwards one after another up to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
Trenches, upbraiding their ancient Comrades for bearing Arms against
<hi>Anthony,</hi> who had saved their lives at <hi>Philippi.</hi> Whereupon the others
answering, that on the contrary they made War upon them, they came at
length to Conferences, wherein they began their reciprocal complaints;
on one side that they had refused them entrance into <hi>Brundusium,</hi> and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<hi>Calenus</hi>'s Army; and the other, that they had besieged <hi>Brundusium,</hi>
made inroads into <hi>Ausonia,</hi> treated with <hi>Aenobarbus</hi> one of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
and with <hi>Pompey</hi> their common Enemy. At length <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Men
discovered their inclinations to the other, that they followed <hi>Caesar</hi> without
having forgot the Virtues of <hi>Anthony,</hi> and that their design was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
a reconciliation between their Generals, to which, if <hi>Anthony</hi> would
by no other means be inclined, then they must repel force with force; all
which they went and published even before <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Trenches.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XV"/> Whilst these things passed, the opportune news was brought of the
death of <hi>Fulvia,</hi> who not able to bear her Husband's reproofs, was fallen
sick with discontent that he was angry with her, for he had left her sick,
and at his departure not vouchsafed to visit her, which hastened her end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
All Men believed her death commodious for both Parties; for she was a
Woman of a turbulent spirit, and who only out of her jealousie of <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi>
had kindled this War. However, <hi>Anthony</hi> seemed much grieved at
the accident, as believing himself the cause. There was one <hi>Lucius Cocceius</hi>
intimately a Friend to both Generals, whom the Summer before <hi>Caesar</hi> had
sent with <hi>Cecinna</hi> as his Envoy to <hi>Anthony</hi> then in <hi>Phaenicia, Cecinna</hi> forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
returning, he had till now stayed with <hi>Anthony.</hi> Thus <hi>Cocceius</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hold on the occasion, feigned that he was recalled by <hi>Caesar,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
audience to take his leave, and <hi>Anthony</hi> permitting him to depart, he
trying him farther, asked whether he would not write to <hi>Caesar,</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Letters from him by the same <hi>Cocceius,</hi> to which <hi>Anthony</hi> replyed:
<hi>What can we now write to one another being Enemies, unless it be mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches;
besides I then returned him answer by</hi> Cecinna, <hi>the Copies of which
you may take if you please.</hi> To this cavil <hi>Cocceius</hi> made retort that <hi>Caesar</hi>
was not to be called an Enemy, who had so favourably treated <hi>Lucius</hi> and
other Friends of his. <hi>But me,</hi> said <hi>Anthony, he has shut out of</hi> Brundusium,
<hi>seised upon my Provinces, and</hi> Calenus's <hi>Army. As for his favour shewed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to my Friends, that has not so much preserved their Friendship to me, as made
them my Enemies by his kindness. Cocceius</hi> hearing him enter upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
would no farther move an angry Man, but went to <hi>Caesar,</hi> who
seeing him, and wondred he was returned no sooner, <hi>Is it</hi> (said he to
him) <hi>because I saved your Brother's life that you are become my Enemy?

                     </gap>cceius</hi> answered; <hi>Is it so you call your Friends Enemies, and take away
their Provinces and Armies?</hi> Caesar hereto replyed; <hi>After</hi> Calenus <hi>'s death
should I have left in the hand of such a young Man Forces of such consequence,</hi>
Anthony <hi>being absent,</hi> Lucius <hi>discontent,</hi> Asinius <hi>and</hi> Aenobarbus <hi>hard by,
and ready to employ them against us? 'Twas the same reason made me hasten
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:65196:259"/>
to get</hi> Plancus <hi>'s Legions into my hands, lest they should have joyned with</hi> Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,
<hi>as the Horse did who went over into</hi> Sicily. To which <hi>Cocceius</hi> made
answer, that things had been otherwise represented to <hi>Anthony,</hi> yet he did
not believe them, till as an Enemy he was shut out of <hi>Brundusium. That
was not done by any command of mine,</hi> replyed <hi>Caesar, nor could I divine that
he was coming to land there, or dream that he should come along with Enemies.
The Inhabitants of</hi> Brundusium, <hi>and the Officers left there in Garrison to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the attempts of</hi> Aenobarbus, <hi>did without orders from me shut their Gates
against</hi> Anthony, <hi>newly confederated with</hi> Pompey <hi>our common Enemy, and
bringing along with him</hi> Aenobarbus <hi>a Parricide, condemned by publick sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
proscribed, and who after the Battel of</hi> Philippi <hi>besieged</hi> Brundusium,
<hi>and to this day wastes all the Coasts of the Ionian Sea, who burnt my
Ships, and plunders all</hi> Italy. To which <hi>Cocceius</hi> made reply: <hi>You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to one another the liberty to treat with whom you pleased;</hi> Anthony <hi>has
no more made peace with any Murderer of your Father than your self, he has too
great an honour for his memory,</hi> Aenobarbus <hi>was none of the Parricides, but
condemned by malicious Iudges, when not conscious of the conspiracy. And if
we think him unworthy of favour for being a Friend to</hi> Brutus, <hi>we must have a
care lest we make all Men our Enemies. The peace was made too with</hi> Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey
<hi>not with design to quarrel with you, but that if you made War upon</hi> Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<hi>he might have him for an Associate, and if you did not, to reconcile you
together, as being a Man you can impeach with no crime. In this too, you are
in the fault; for had there been no motion of War in</hi> Italy, <hi>they durst not have
sent Deputies to</hi> Anthony. Thereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> pursuing his complaints, said,
<hi>'Twas</hi> Manius, Fulvia <hi>and</hi> Lucius <hi>made War upon me and</hi> Italy, <hi>and never
durst</hi> Pompey <hi>before with his Forces attempt the Coasts till he was encouraged to
it by</hi> Anthony. <hi>Not only encouraged,</hi> said <hi>Cocceius, but commanded, for I
will hide nothing from you: he will with his Fleet invade the rest of</hi> Italy, <hi>now
destitute as it is of Shipping, unless you make peace.</hi> Whereto <hi>Caesar,</hi> who
had not without reflections listened to this discourse of <hi>Cocceius:</hi> said, <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi>
Pompey <hi>has but little to brag of, being repulsed from</hi> Thuria. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

of <hi>Fulvia</hi>'s death, how not enduring her Husband's displeasure, she
fell sick, and her Distemper increasing by a continual melancholy, that <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
was so unkind as not to visit her in her sickness, it had hastened her
end. <hi>And now she is dead,</hi> said he, <hi>there needs nothing more than that you
explain your mutual suspicions to one another. Caesar</hi> mollified by this discourse
of <hi>Cocceius,</hi> made him his Guest for that day, who entreated him as the
younger to write to <hi>Anthony</hi> his elder: he denyed writing to his Enemy,
from whence he had received no Letters, but complained that his Mother
whom he had always so perfectly honoured, as his Kinswoman, had fle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

out of <hi>Italy,</hi> as if she could not have commanded him as if he had been her
own Son; so under this pretence <hi>Caesar</hi> wrote to <hi>Iulia.</hi> As <hi>Cocceius</hi> was
going out of the Camp many Centurions discovered to him the mind of the
Army, who with all the rest told this likewise to <hi>Anthony,</hi> that he might
understand what a War he was about to engage himself in if he made not
peace with <hi>Caesar.</hi> Wherefore he advised him to remand <hi>Pompey,</hi> who
wasted <hi>Italy,</hi> into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and to send <hi>Aenobarbus</hi> into some other part, till
new Leagues were made. To this <hi>Iulia</hi> his Mother joyning her prayers
and intreaties; there was nothing stood in the way but the shame <hi>Anthony</hi>
feared he should be exposed to, if the Peace not succeeding he should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
be forced to have recourse to <hi>Pompey</hi>'s assistance; but his Mother put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him in hopes, confirmed by <hi>Cocceius</hi> partaker of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s privacies,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:65196:260"/>
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> consented, caused <hi>Pompey</hi> to return to <hi>Sicily,</hi> promising to take
care of all matters agreed on between them, and sending <hi>Aenobarbus</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
into <hi>Bithynia;</hi> which as soon as <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Army knew, they chose
Deputies to go to both Generals, whom they besought to refrain from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
each other; for they were not made choice of to judge, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
them; so that making <hi>Cocceius</hi> Friend to both for Arbitrator, and
nominating <hi>Pollio</hi> for <hi>Anthony,</hi> and <hi>Maecenas</hi> for <hi>Caesar,</hi> they decreed a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
oblivion for all past offences, and perfect friendship for the future.
And because <hi>Marcellus,</hi> Husband to <hi>Octavia Caesar</hi>'s Sister, was lately
dead, the authors of the peace desired <hi>Caesar</hi> to give his Sister in marriage to
<hi>Anthony:</hi> she was soon promised, with happy auguries, for these accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations
were atttended with universal acclamation of both Armies, with
vows for their prosperity, and continued rejoycings, which held all that
day and the next night.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> Then <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> made a new division of the Roman Empire,
setling for the bounds of eithers Dominion <hi>Scodran</hi> a Town in <hi>Illyria,</hi> which
seemed seated in the Center of the Adriatick Gulf; from whence East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
as far as the <hi>Euphrates</hi> all the Provinces and Islands were to be under
the command of <hi>Anthony;</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> was to have all Westward as far as the
Ocean, except <hi>Africa</hi> which was left to <hi>Lepidus</hi> under the same conditions
he had received it from <hi>Caesar.</hi> They agreed likewise that <hi>Caesar</hi> should
make War with <hi>Pompey,</hi> if some change happened not, and <hi>Anthony</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Parthians to revenge <hi>Crassus</hi>'s death; that <hi>Aenobarbus</hi> should be
received into league by <hi>Caesar,</hi> on the same conditions <hi>Anthony</hi> had before
granted him. And that both Generals might have equal power to raise
Soldiers in <hi>Italy.</hi> In these Heads consisted the last league between <hi>Caesar</hi>
and <hi>Pompey:</hi> soon after which they sent away their Friends to dispatch ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Affairs, <hi>Anthony</hi> sent <hi>Ventidius</hi> into <hi>Asia</hi> to oppose the attempts of the
Parthians and the young <hi>Labienus,</hi> who being joyned with them, infested
<hi>Syria</hi> as far as <hi>Ionia,</hi> taking the advantage of the Civil Wars. But how

                  </gap>it in the Book of

again drew out of <hi>Sardinia Helenus</hi> one of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Lieutenants, which
was the main reason of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s being so incensed, that he would not admit
of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s intermission to reconcile him with <hi>Pompey.</hi> Afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
returned to the City, the Nuptials were solemnised, and <hi>Anthony</hi> put
<hi>Manius</hi> to death for exasperating <hi>Fulvia</hi> against <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and making her
the author of so many mischiefs. He likewise discovered to <hi>Caesar</hi> how <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidienus,</hi>
who commanded the Army in <hi>Gallia Narbonensis,</hi> would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted to him, and to that purpose had sent an express to him at the Siege
of <hi>Brundusium:</hi> all Men did not much applaud him for it, but he revealed
this secret to shew his frankness and the reality of his reconciliation: <hi>Caesar</hi>
forthwith sent command to <hi>Salvidienus</hi> to make haste to him, as if he had
something of importance to communicate, after which he would send him
back to the Army; but at his arrival reproaching him with his treachery,
he put him to death, and gave his Army, being jealous of it, to <hi>Anthony.</hi>
Mean while, the People were much oppressed with Famine; for the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
could bring nothing from the East, for fear of <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi>
nor from the West, because <hi>Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Corsica</hi> were in the possession of
<hi>Pompey</hi> too. Nor out of <hi>Africa,</hi> because of the Enemies Ships cruising in
the open Sea; wherefore the People attributing the cause of their want of
Bread to the division of those who commanded, continually reviled them,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:65196:260"/>
urged them to make peace with <hi>Pompey.</hi> But when thus neither they could
not incline <hi>Caesar</hi> to it, <hi>Anthony</hi> counselled him to hasten the War to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
the present distress: but because there was no Money to make the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
they made an Edict by which Masters were taxed in twenty five
Sesterces for every Slave they had (the like whereof had been before in
the War with <hi>Cassius</hi>) and withal a certain part to be payed out of new
Inheritances. The People enraged, tore down this Edict whereever it
was fixed up, growing furious, that after the treasury was exhausted, the
Provinces drained dry, and <hi>Italy</hi> ruined by continual Imposts and Confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
the Citizens should be taxed for what they had yet left, and that
not to employ in foreign Wars, where the Honour of the Empire might
lie at stake, but to revenge particular Mens quarrels, and increase their
power, to which they were mounted by Proscriptions and Murders, and
for which the People were fain to suffer Famine and Misery. They gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together by Troops, railing in the Streets, throwing Stones at those
who would not joyn with them, and threatening to plunder and set fire on
their Houses, till at length the whole multitude was got into a Body. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
going with his Guards and some Friends to appease them, and give
them reasons for what he had done, as soon as they saw him they let fly their
Stones, and though he stirred not, but stood their Blows, yet they had no
reverence nor respect to him; of which <hi>Anthony</hi> having notice, ran speed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily
to his relief, as he came up the <hi>Via Sacra</hi> none threw Stones at him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was disposed to make Peace with <hi>Pompey,</hi> they only warned him
to be gone; but when that prevailed not, the Stones flew likewise about his
Ears. Whereupon he sent for the Soldiers who were without the City,
and when the People forbore not their violences, the Soldiers having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed
them on both sides came up the cross Streets upon them in the
place, and in the great Street, charging the first he met with, who not able
to flie because of the Crowd, and not being in a posture of defence, the
Streets were soon filled with dead and wounded Men, and the Windows
with cryes and lamentations. Thus <hi>Anthony</hi> hardly escaping himself, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
<hi>Caesar</hi> from manifest danger, and brought him to his House. The mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
being put to flight, they commanded the Soldiers to cast the Corps into
<hi>Tiber,</hi> not to expose the sad spectacle to the Citizens view, but this caused
a far greater affliction, when they beheld them carried away with the
stream, or stripped by the Soldiers, among whom were mingled several
Brokers, who carried away those were best clad, as if they had belonged
to their Family. However, this mischief at length had an end, but not
the multitudes hate and malice to these Men, nor yet the Famine which
the miserable People underwent with groans and tears.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anthony</hi> hereupon gave advice to <hi>Libo</hi>'s Friends to invite him out of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVII"/>
to rejoyce with his Relations, and possibly do a work of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
promising to be security for his person. They presently wrote
to him, nor did <hi>Pompey</hi> at all detain him. In his Voyage he landed in an
Island formerly called <hi>Pithicusa,</hi> and at present <hi>Aenario,</hi> which as soon as
the People heard of, they again assembled, beseeching <hi>Caesar</hi> with tears
in their eyes to send a Pass-port to <hi>Libo</hi> who came with Proposals of Peace,
which though with seeming unwillingness he granted. That done the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
ran to <hi>Mutia, Pompey</hi>'s Mother, threatening to burn her if she did not
go to her Son, and dispose him to a Peace. <hi>Libo</hi> perceiving their Enemies
not so hot against them as formerly, desired a conference between the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
to the end they might compose all matters between themselves,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65196:261"/>
which after the Peoples earnest prayers had obtained, <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi>
went to <hi>Baiae. Pompey</hi>'s Friends all with one voice advised him to Peace,
except only <hi>Menodorus,</hi> who wrote to him from <hi>Sardinia,</hi> that he ought
rather now to make War, or at least temporize, whilst Famine fought for
them, that when they judged it fit to conclude a Peace, they might do it on
more advantageous conditions, he likewise warned him to have a care of
<hi>Murcus,</hi> who counselled him to make Peace only for the advancement of
his particular fortune; wherefore <hi>Pompey,</hi> who was before jealous of
<hi>Murcus's</hi> experience and authority broke now utterly with him, and no
longer took his counsel in any thing: so <hi>Murcus</hi> in discontent retired to <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusa,</hi>
where perceiving some of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Guards that followed him by his
orders, he in their presence railed at and reviled him, this hastened his
end; for <hi>Pompey</hi> having corrupted one of his Tribunes, and one of his
Centurions, sent People to slay him, giving out that he was murdered by
his Slaves, whom they hanged, to give the more credit to the cheat. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
after what had happened to <hi>Bithynicus,</hi> Men easily believed this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
attempt committed on the person of a Man famous for his experience
in War, a constant Friend to <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Faction from the very beginning,
who had done him signal service in <hi>Spain,</hi> and of his own accord came to
him in <hi>Sicily.</hi> After his death all <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Friends exhorted him to
Peace, accusing <hi>Menodorus</hi> of being in love with Command, considering
more his own than his Masters interest, finding it profitable to govern a
Province with an Army; so <hi>Pompey</hi> embarqued for <hi>Aenaria</hi> with many
choice Ships, and himself on a most beautiful Galley of six Banks; and
thus in great state came sailing towards the Evening by <hi>Puteoli,</hi> in view of
the Enemy. As soon as day next Morning appeared, they drove Piles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea, at some distance one from the other, and thereon laid two
Bridges, upon one of which to the Land-side mounted <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony,</hi>
and <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Libo</hi> on the other, which was separate on the first by a small
interval of water; so that without speaking aloud they could hardly hear
each other, <hi>Pompey</hi> pretended to be Associate in the Empire, in the room
of <hi>Lepidus;</hi> and the others would only grant him the liberty to return to
<hi>Rome,</hi> so they parted without doing any thing: yet their Friends kept on
foot the Negotiation, making divers Propositions on the one part and the
other; <hi>Pompey</hi> in behalf of the Proscripts had fled to him for refuge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that such as were culpable, or Abettors of <hi>Caesar's</hi> Murder might
be in security in their Exile, and that the others might with Honour be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called into the City, and put into possession of their Estates: upon this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
Famine, and the People urging for Peace, <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> agreed
that they might redeem from the new Possessors a fourth part of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
only, and they wrote to them about it, as supposing they would be
therewith contented, and indeed so they were, for they began now to stand
in fear of <hi>Pompey,</hi> instructed by <hi>Murcus</hi> his misfortune, going therefore to
him, and perswading him to Peace, he rent his Robe, saying, he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
by those for whom he had exposed himself, and calling by name <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodorus</hi>
as the sole Man worthy of Command, and the only Friend he had.
At length by the instigation of <hi>Mutia</hi> his Mother, and <hi>Iulia</hi> his Wife, they
met again only they three on a little Eminence, encompassed on all sides by
the Sea, about which they had placed Guards with Ships for their common
security. Here they agreed to these Conditions; That all War should cease
between them, both by Sea and Land, that there should be a free trade and
commerce in all places, that <hi>Pompey</hi> should withdraw all his Garrisons
out of <hi>Italy,</hi> that he should harbour no more Fugitives, that his Ships
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:65196:261"/>
should cruise no more on the Italian Coasts; that he should have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Sicily, Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Corsica,</hi> with the other adjacent Isles for so
long as <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> held the Sovereign Power, but with condition of
sending to <hi>Rome</hi> what Corn those Islands ought to the Citizens, and that
besides all this he should have the <hi>Peloponnesus;</hi> that being absent he might
exercise the charge of Consul by one of his Friends, and should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the Colledge of the High Priests; that all persons of Quality
might return to the City except the Conspirators who had been condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by publick sentence; that the Goods of all those fled to <hi>Pompey</hi> without
being proscribed should be restored, except the Moveables; and for the
Proscripts that they should have a sourth part; that all who had served under
<hi>Pompey</hi> should be rewarded, if Slaves with Freedom, and if Freemen,
when they had served the time appointed by Law, with the same recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
as the Veterans of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> received. These were the
Articles, which after being ingrossed and signed, were sent to <hi>Rome</hi> to be
deposited in the hands of the Vestals. This done, they by lot feasted each
other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> began, who laying his Galley side to the Rock therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his Guests; the days following <hi>Anthony</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> treated him, pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tents on the same Rock, with pretence that the Feast might be distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
better to the Shore, but perhaps that their mirth might be more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure;
for there was nothing remitted of the useal care, both the Ships
were in their stations, and the Guards at their Posts, and the Guests them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
had Daggers under their Robes. 'Tis reported, that <hi>Menodorus,</hi>
when they feasted in the Galley, sent to advise <hi>Pompey,</hi> that taking this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of his Enemies, he should revenge the wrongs his Father and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had suffered, and recover the authority they had taken from his Father,
and he would be answerable that not one should escape out of the Ships.
But <hi>Pompey</hi> made him an answer wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Daughter, Neice to <hi>Libo,</hi> was contracted to <hi>Marcellus,</hi> Nephew to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony,

lastly <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> again, who being now to be Consuls together the
third time, it was hoped they would restore the ancient Administration of
the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Things thus concluded on, they departed, <hi>Pompey</hi> by Sea to <hi>Sicily,</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVIII"/>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Anthony</hi> by land to <hi>Rome.</hi> Upon the news of the Peace an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
joy was spread through the City and all <hi>Italy,</hi> Men were transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to see themselves delivered from an intestine War, from being often pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, and forced to go, from the insolency of the Garrisoris, from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

of Slaves, from the wasting of their Lands, and lying fallow of their
Fields, but above all from Famine, which began to grow insupportable:
wherefore whereever the Generals passed, Sacrifices were made to them
as to the Savlours of their Country. And the City had prepared a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
entry, had they not rather chose to go in by night, that they might
not put the Citizens to charge. All shared in this general joy, save only
those who were possessed of any Lands of the banished, which, by the
Treaty were to be restored, for they believed they should have but ill Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of them, and that upon all occasions they would seek their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
And indeed all the Fugitives who had hitherto followed <hi>Pompey,</hi>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:65196:262"/>
except<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>only a very few, after having taken their leave of him at <hi>Puteoli,</hi>
embarqued and came for <hi>Rome,</hi> at whose arrival the People conceived a
new joy, which tey made appear by those Acclamations wherewith they
entertained so many illustrious persons, beyond all hopes returned to their
Country. After this <hi>Caesar</hi> marched into <hi>Gaul,</hi> where there were happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some Commotions; and <hi>Anthony</hi> disposed his Affairs to go against the
Parthians. In the first place he caused the Senate to approve not only what
he had done, but whatever he should do for the future, sent away his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants
into all parts, and disposed what else he thought fit at pleasure.
Then he gave Kingdoms to several, upon condition of paying Tribute.
To <hi>Darius</hi> Son of <hi>Pharnaces</hi> and Grandson to <hi>Mithridates</hi> the Kingdom of
<hi>Pontus:</hi> to <hi>Herod Idumea</hi> and <hi>Samaria:</hi> to <hi>Amintas Pisidia:</hi> to <hi>Polemon</hi>
part of <hi>Cilicia:</hi> and in short, to many others other Nations which he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
into Kingdoms. As for the Army that was to winter with him, that
he might accustom them both to the profits and exercises of War, he sent
one part of them into the Country of the Parthians a Nation of <hi>Illyria,</hi>
neighbouring upon <hi>Epidamnum,</hi> formerly very affectionate to <hi>Brutus:</hi> and
another Party into the Country of the Dardanians, who are another People
of <hi>Illyria</hi> used to make Inroads into <hi>Macedon,</hi> and gave orders to the rest
to tarry for him in <hi>Epire,</hi> that he might have them all about him, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
himself to winter at <hi>Athens.</hi> He likewife sent <hi>Furnius</hi> into <hi>Africa</hi> to
cause <hi>Sextius</hi>'s four Legions to march against the Parthians; for as yet he
understood not that <hi>Lepidus</hi> had taken them from <hi>Sextius.</hi> Things thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
he spent this Winter at <hi>Athens</hi> with <hi>Octavia,</hi> in the same manner as
he had done the former with <hi>Cleopatra</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> all his business being
only to look upon the Letters brought him from the Army, he laid aside
his Imperial Robe, cloathing himself again in the Attick Cloak and Hose,
having no Guards at his Gate, and walking through the City like a private
person, without any Ensigns of his Dignity, and accompanied only with
two Friends and two servants, with whom he went to the Schools to hear
Disputes and Orations; he likewise supped the Winter after the Greek
manner, having always Greeks in his company, and assisting at their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
to the great content of <hi>Octavia,</hi> of whom he was very fond; for
he was naturally inclined to the love of Women. But Winter being past,
he seemed no more the same Man, he resumed the Imperial Habit, and
took the Ensigns of his authority, his Gates seemed now as it were besieged
with Lictors, Officers and Guards, to beget an awe of his power, he gave
audience to Embassadors, whom before he would not admit, administred
justice to private persons, and sent for Ships from all parts, and made a
mighty noise with his preparations.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XIX"/> Whilst he was busied in these things, there happened some disturbances
of the Peace between <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> for what certain causes not known,
but those that publickly appeared were these, <hi>Anthony</hi> had quitted the <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponnesus</hi>
to <hi>Pompey</hi> on condition he should pay what the Peloponnesians
ought, or promise to pay it, or else give some time for the recovery of it;
but <hi>Pompey</hi> would not receive it in on these terms, thinking the Province
quitted to him with all its debts; wherewith, through discontent, (as <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
said) or through infidelity, or out of envy to others who had great
Armies, or because he trusted <hi>Menodorus,</hi> who said they had not made a
Peace but a Truce, he prepared again and fitted out a Fleet, and in a speech
to his Army told them, there was more need than ever of new preparations.
He likewise encouraged Pyrates underhand to infest the Seas, so that little
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:65196:262"/>
or no remedy was brought to the Famine in the City, and the comfortless
People cryed out, that by this Peace they had not redressed any of their
miseries, but only added a fourth person to the Tyranny. Hereupon some
Pyrates being taken, <hi>Caesar</hi> caused them to be brought to the wrack, where
they confessed they were set on by <hi>Pompey,</hi> which <hi>Caesar</hi> made known to the
People; he wrote about it likewise to <hi>Pompey,</hi> who stoutly denying it,
made his complaints about the <hi>Peloponnesus.</hi> But some Noble Men that
were about <hi>Pompey</hi> perceiving that he always followed the the counsel of his
Freed Men, corrupted some of them, either of their own free motion, or
for <hi>Caesar</hi>'s sake, to incense <hi>Pompey</hi> against <hi>Menodorus</hi> as a Man command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Master. They were easily drawn to do this, out of the envy they
bore this powerful Favourite, so they soon begot in <hi>Pompey</hi> an aversion to
<hi>Menodorus.</hi> It happened that at the same time <hi>Philadelphus Caesar's</hi> Freed
Man came to <hi>Menodorus</hi> to buy Corn, and <hi>Mycilius; Menodorus</hi> confident
went to <hi>Rome</hi> to treat with <hi>Caesar</hi> about his revolt, to whom he offered <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia,
Corsica,</hi> three Legions and many of his Friends: whether <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
had procured <hi>Caesar</hi> this good fortune, or else it proceeded from <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s
disgusts of <hi>Menodorus,</hi> he made difficulty of accepting it, yet did it,
judging the Peace already broken. He dispatched forthwith to <hi>Anthony</hi> at
<hi>Athens</hi> to desire him to come by an appointed day to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> to confe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with him about this War, he caused long Ships to be brought from <hi>Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
and sent in all haste for his Army out of <hi>Gaul</hi> with all its stores of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Furniture, one part of which he sent to <hi>Brundusium,</hi> and the other to
<hi>Puteoli,</hi> resolved to invade <hi>Sicily</hi> on both sides, if <hi>Anthony</hi> approved it:
<hi>Anthony</hi> came at the same time prefixed with a slender Train, but not
finding <hi>Caesar</hi> there, would not stay, whether he approved not this War
undertaken agaisnt solemn Leagues, whether he were not pleased to see
the great preparations of <hi>Caesar,</hi> (for being Competitors for Empire, they
were always jealous of each other) or whether he was frightned by a
prodigy, for one of those who were upon the Guard about his Quarters,
was found eaten up by Beasts, all but the Face, as if that had been left to
know him by, without ever so much as crying out, or the least knowledge
of those that slept by him. All that could be discovered, was, that they
of <hi>Brundusium</hi> said, that in the Morning they saw a Wolf come out from
among the Tents. However, <hi>Anthony</hi> wrote to <hi>Caesar</hi> he ought not to
break the peace, and threatned to clap <hi>Menodorus</hi> in Irons as his Fugitive
Slave, for he had been Slave to <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, whose Goods <hi>Anthony</hi>
bought under the Spear by right of War. Yet <hi>Caesar</hi> sent Men into the
Islands of <hi>Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Corsica</hi> to take possession of them from <hi>Menodorus,</hi>
and caused Forts to be built upon all the Coasts of <hi>Italy</hi> to hinder <hi>Pompey</hi>
from making any spoil, giving orders for building other Ships at <hi>Ravenna,</hi>
and sending for a powerful Army that was in <hi>Illyria,</hi> and when <hi>Menodorus</hi>
came to him, from one enfranchised made him absolutely free, by giving
him the Command of the Fleet he brought with him, yet but in quality of
Lieutenant to <hi>Calvisius</hi> his Admiral. Though things were thus well dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
yet he would make greater preparations before he began the War,
complaining of <hi>Anthony,</hi> that he had not staid for him: however, he gave
order to <hi>Cornisicius</hi> to bring what Ships he had in readiness from <hi>Ravenna</hi> to
<hi>Tarentum;</hi> in his passage there arose a furious Tempest, in which there yet
perished only the Admiral, built on purpose for <hi>Caesar</hi> himself, which was
made an Omen of what was to happen, for most men thought this War re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
by the violation of the Treaty; to remove which suspicion, <hi>Caesar</hi>
wrote to the Roman People, and spoke in person to the Army, telling
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:65196:263"/>them <hi>Pompey</hi> had broke the League, by infesting the Sea with Pyrates,
which was evident, both by confession of the Pyrates themselves, and of
<hi>Menodorus,</hi> of which <hi>Antonius</hi> was not yet ignorant, and thefore delivered
not up to him the <hi>Peloponnesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XX"/> When all his preparations were in a readiness, he embarqued at <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
to go and invade <hi>Sicily</hi> on one side, whilst <hi>Calvisius, Sabinus</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodorus,</hi>
who set sail from <hi>Etruria,</hi> invested it on the other; and the Land
Army marched towards <hi>Rhegium</hi> with wonderful diligence. <hi>Pompey</hi> perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not that <hi>Menodorus</hi> had revolted from him to <hi>Caesar,</hi> till he came before
<hi>Sicily.</hi> However, seeing himself assailed on both sides, he resolved to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<hi>Caesar</hi> at <hi>Messina,</hi> and opposed against <hi>Calvisius</hi> and <hi>Menodorus</hi> a great
Fleet under the Command of <hi>Menecrates</hi> his Freed Man, who out of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
emulation was a mortal Enemy to <hi>Menodorus. Menecrates</hi> comes out
to Sea, presenting himself about Evening to the Enemy, who retired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Gulf above <hi>Cuma,</hi> where they anchored that night, and he steered his
course towards the Island of <hi>Aenaria.</hi> As soon as it was day, the Enemy
coasting about the Bay, drawn up in form of a Crescent, for fear of being
broken, <hi>Menecrates</hi> appeared in sight, and made towards them; but seeing
they would not be drawn off from the Shore-side, and that he could not do
what he designed, with a fierce charge he drove them a ground; so with
their sterns ashore, and their Prows to Seaward, they lay upon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
in such manner, that it was easie for the Enemy to come and give
them a shock, and then tacking about to stand off to Sea, and so return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
upon them with fresh and fresh Ships, they had likewise the Rocks to
struggle with, on which many stuck so fast, that neither moving Head
nor Stern, it seemed like a kind of Sea-fight against a Land Force, one of
which could neither flie, nor the other pursue. Mean while <hi>Menodorus</hi>
and <hi>Menecrates</hi> having discovered each other, leaving the rest of the Fight
with mutual shouts and fury begin an assault, and in all appearance which
of these two got the better would carry the Victory for his Party. In the
charge they met so fiercely, that both Ships were disabled, <hi>Menodorus</hi> lost
his<note n="*" place="margin">Rostrum.</note> Beak-head, and <hi>Menecrates</hi> Oars were broken. At length, having
cast their Graplings on Board, they lashed their Ships fast together, and
began a Fight, as if on dry ground, and nothing was wanting, either of
alacrity or dexterity to gain the Victory, they made use of all sorts of Arms,
Arrows, Stones, Darts, and cast Planks from Ship to Ship to board
each other; but because <hi>Menodorus</hi>'s Ship was the tallest, it was much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
for his Men to board the other, and the Darts they threw fell with more
violence and execution. At last many being slain, and almost all the rest
wounded, <hi>Menodorus</hi> had his Arm pierced through with a Dart, which
was soon drawn out; but <hi>Menecrates</hi> being struck into the Thigh with a
Barbed Iron Javelin, made after the Spanish Fashion, which could not easily
be drawn out, he became unable to do more, yet still with his voice he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
his Men, till his Ship being taken, he threw himself over-board;
<hi>Menodorus</hi> fastening his Prize to his Poop towed it into the Road, and was
all he could do that day. This was done on the Left Wing. On the Right
Wing which fought against the Enemies Left, <hi>Calvisius</hi> cut off some of
<hi>Menecrates</hi>'s Ships from the rest of the Squadron, and pursued them out to
Sea: but <hi>Democrates</hi> another of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Freed Men charging the rest of
<hi>Calvisius</hi>'s Ships, put some of them to flight, and drove the rest upon the
Rocks where they were beat to pieces, and the Men forced to cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the Sea, and those which remained whole he had burnt, had not
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:65196:263"/>
                  <hi>Calvisius</hi> returning from the Chase of the Enemy, and bringing along with
him some of his Ships that had fled, saved one of them. Night coming
on, each party retreated to the same places where they rode the Night
before, and so ended this Sea-Fight wherein <hi>Pompey</hi> had much the better.
Yet <hi>Demochares</hi> was so much concern'd for <hi>Menecrates</hi>'s death, which he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
a mighty loss (for <hi>Menedorus</hi> and <hi>Menecrates</hi> were two of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s
principal Officers at Sea) that he left all, and steered his course directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Sicily,</hi> as if he had not only lost <hi>Menecrates</hi> and one Vessel, but the
whole Fleet. As for <hi>Calvisius,</hi> as long as he thought <hi>Demochares</hi> would
return to him he kept his station, being in no condition to fight, for
his best Ships were sunk, and the rest disabled; but when he heard his
Enemy was gone for <hi>Sicily,</hi> he refitted his Ships, and held on his course,
keeping the Shore close aboard, and not so much as crossing over any
Bay.</p>
               <p>On the other side, <hi>Caesar</hi> being come from <hi>Tarentum</hi> to <hi>Rhegium</hi> with a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXI"/>
great Fleet and a mighty Army met <hi>Pompey</hi> near <hi>Messina,</hi> who had but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Ships; wherefore his Friends advised him not to let slip this opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but to assault these few with his whole Navy, now in such good order,
before more Ships came to <hi>Pompey,</hi> but he would not hearken to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
expecting <hi>Calvisius,</hi> and not thinking it prudence to expose himself to
danger, whilst he expected greater Forces. Mean while, <hi>Demochares</hi>
coming to <hi>Messina, Pompey</hi> gave him and <hi>Apollophanes,</hi> another of his Freed
Men, the Command of the Fleet instead of <hi>Menecrates</hi> and <hi>Menedorus;</hi>
and <hi>Caesar</hi> understanding the loss he had suffered near <hi>Cuma,</hi> set forward
through the Strait to go meet <hi>Calvisius,</hi> having got through the better part,
as he was passing by the place called <hi>Stylida</hi> to turn about the Rock of <hi>Sylla,
Pompey</hi> coming out of <hi>Messina</hi> first fell upon his Rear, and after came up
with the rest of the Fleet to provoke <hi>Caesar</hi> to give him Battel; and though
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s Ships were sorely infested, yet they stirred not from about the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,
he having forbid it, whether he durst not fight in the Strait, or
whether he was firm to the resolution of not fighting without <hi>Calvisius,</hi> he
only gave them orders to get close under Shore, and there coming to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
defend themselves from the Forecastles, if any came to assault them.
But <hi>Demochares</hi> coming with two Ships to charge each Ship of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s, put
them all into trouble and disorder, so that some were split against the Rocks
others falling foul of each other, sunk; and in short, many perished most
cowardly, for in the same manner as at the Battel at <hi>Cuma</hi> they stuck fast,
whilst the Enemies charging, and then falling off, oppressed them in a
strange manner, nor was fortune wanting to assist the Enemy: <hi>Caesar</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in this confusion leaped out upon the Rocks, where he received those
that saved themselves by swimming, and led them himself to the next
Mountains. But <hi>Cornificius</hi> and the rest of the Captains encouraging one
another, without their General's order, cut their Cables, and went out to
Sea to charge the Enemy, judging it better to die fighting, than thus to be
exposed to Blows without any defence. <hi>Cornisicius</hi> first of all with a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
boldness clapped on board the Admiral Ship of <hi>Demochares,</hi> and
took her, forcing him to leap into another. Whilst in this Fight a world
of Men perished, <hi>Calvisius</hi> and <hi>Menodorus</hi> appeared, coming with full
Sails, not towards <hi>Caesar</hi>'s People, who were either cast on shore, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
at Sea, but towards <hi>Pompey</hi>'s, who being far off from Land, as soon
as they saw them, retreated, for tired, they durst not engage fresh Men,
and besides, 'twas almost night; yet the chance was happy for those yet in
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65196:264"/>
danger. Night coming on, many deserted their Ships, and fled to the
Mountains, where they kindled many Fires for Signals to those yet at Sea,
so they spent the night without meat, without sleep, and in want of all
things, yet they comforted themselves with the presence of <hi>Caesar,</hi> who no
better supplyed than they, went from place to place, exhorting them to
have patience till Morning. They knew not yet <hi>Calvisius</hi> was so nigh,
and had no hopes in their own Ships, forsaken because of the Wrack; but
by good fortune the thirteenth Legion, which had taken their March over
the Mountains, and was not far off, having heard of the disaster, by crag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
ways making towards the Fires, found their General and those with
him hungry and weary. The Soldiers took what care they could of their
companions, and the Officers forthwith brought their General (left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any of his Houshold Servants dispersed in the tumult of the Night) to
a Tent there pitched, whence sending all about to give notice he was safe,
news was brought him that <hi>Calvisius</hi> was arrived, and so unexpectedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed
with this second good tydings, he took some repose. As soon as it
was day, casting his eyes upon the Sea, he saw Ships flaming, others burnt,
and others half burnt, others floating upon the Sea in the midst of pieces of
Wracks, Masts, Sails and Yards, and many that remained, sorely shatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
near the Shore; wherefore ordering <hi>Calvisius</hi>'s Fleet to come near, he
took care for necessaries to patch up such Ships as yet might be made ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable,
while the Enemy gave them leisure, who were retreated, either
out of fear of <hi>Calvisius,</hi> or because they had rather fight him in open
Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXII"/> While things were in this condition, about Noon rose a Wind from the
South, which soon began to make the Waves roar in a Sea naturally mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with little wind. <hi>Pompey</hi> was now safe in the Harbour of <hi>Messina;</hi>
but <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Ships on a Lee shore, craggy Rocks, and without any Port,
were either dashed against the Rocks, or against one another, besides want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many necessary Tacklings, they were not easie to govern. <hi>Menodorus</hi>
therefore fearing lest the wind should yet every hour grow fresher, got out at
first into the open Sea, and came to an Anchor, because in deep water the
Waves broke less, and not so violently, and with the force of Oars he eased
his Cables, lest his Anchors should give way: some others imitated him,
but the greater part imagining the Storm would soon be over, as is usual in
the Spring, moor'd their Ships with an Anchor to Sea, and another to the
Shore, and with Booms kept them off from falling foul of each other:
but the wind raging more and more, all fell into confusion and disorder, for
their Cables breaking, they either fell foul or run ashore one after another;
several cries and lamentations and howlings were mixed with Commands
and Exhortations, which were only uttered to deaf people, there was now
no difference between the Pilot and the Sailer, neither for industry, skill,
nor obedience. They perished all alike, whether they stayed in their Ships, or
leaped over-board, they were killed by the pieces of Timber which the Waves
beat against the Ships; for all the Sea was floating with the Wrack of the
Ships, and with Bodies some dead, and some living, of which, if any
swum to Shore, they were miserably beat in pieces among the Rocks, but
when the Sea began to swell with a contrary wind, as it ordinarily happens
in this Strait, new terrours seised these people who were not accustomed to
it, and their Ships tossed now this way, and then the other, fell foul, do all
they could; besides towards the Evening, the wind doubled its violence,
to double their grief by making them perish in the dark; so that all Night
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65196:264"/>
long the air was filled with dreadful Shouts and Crys. Those upon the
Shore ran up and down calling their Friends they thought engaged in the
Shipwrack by name, and when they answered them not, believed them
lost, and wept: others lifting their Heads above the Waves, called to their
Friends on Shore to help them, but there was no manner of way to assist
them; for as it was dangerous for those staid in the Ship, or leaped into the
Sea, so it was no less upon the Shore side, because of the Waves driven up
by the Winds, which all that came near were fearful to be carried away
with. Thus by an extraordinary effect of the Tempest those who were
near Land, feared the Land, and yet durst no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> go farther off to Sea, than
to secure themselves from beating in peices against the Rocks; for the place
narrow by nature, the difficulty of the passage, the tumbling of the
Waves, the Whirlwinds caused by the circumjacent Hills, and the swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Whirlpool by the fierceness of the Current suffered them not to stay in
one place, nor yet to retire back, besides the horrour of an extreme dark
night added still to their affliction. Thus they perished without seeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
another, some crying out, others silently expecting death, and others
through despair hastening it, for the expectation is but an addition of pain;
and now they were all out of hopes of any safety, when on a sudden to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
break of day the wind began to duller, and about Sun-rising there
was little or none, yet the Sea still continued in a rage. The Inhabitants
of the Country remembred not to have even seen so furious a Tempest.
Thus the greatest part of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Ships and Men perished, and he besides
the loss sustained in the first Sea-Fight, having received these two afflictions
one in the neck of the other, retreated the same night with all haste to
<note n="*" place="margin">Now <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teleon.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Vibone,</hi> by the Mountain Way, not enduring longer to look on that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to which he could apply no remedy.</p>
               <p>From thence he wrote to all his Friends, and all his Commanders to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIII"/>
speedily to him, for fear lest, as it ordinarily befalls the unfortunate,
some new design should be laid against him, he likewise sent all the Land
Forces he had with him along the Coasts of <hi>Italy,</hi> for fear lest <hi>Pompey</hi> puffed
up with this success should make some attempt; but he thought nothing
of it, no, nor so much, as when the Sea was still, of falling upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of the Shipwrack, neither while they lay there, nor when they
were upon departure. On the contrary, he suffered them to gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whatever they could save of Ships or Rigging, and make a safe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
before the wind to <hi>Vibone,</hi> whether he thought he had beat them suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently,
or that he knew not how to make use of his advantage; or else,
as we have said el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ewhere, was cow-hearted upon an Assault, and content
only to defend himself, <hi>Caesar</hi> had not above half his Ships left, and those
but in ill condition, yet leaving Forces to guard them, he went much troubled
in mind into <hi>Campania,</hi> for he had no more Ships, nor time to
build any, though he stood in great need of them, the Famine growing
sharp, and the people crying out incessantly for peace, and detesting this
War, as undertaken contrary to a solemn League; besides, he wanted
Money, which was scarce at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Citizens would pay nothing,
nor permit any to be raised on them. At length, being very politick in the
conduct of his own Affairs, he dispatched <hi>Maecenas</hi> to <hi>Anthony,</hi> well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
to clear all new differences might have happened between them,
and to draw him to be his Associate in the War, which, if it succeeded
not, he resolved to transport his Legions into <hi>Sicily</hi> upon Ships of Burthen,
and there fight <hi>Pompey</hi> by Land, without any more hazarding a Sea-fight.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65196:265"/>
Whilst he was perplexing himself with these cares, news was brought
him that <hi>Anthony</hi> had passed his word to serve him; that <hi>Agrippa,</hi> his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
in <hi>Gaul</hi> had gained a great Victory against the Aquitains, and that
his Friends and some Cities promised him Ships, which were already build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
whereupon taking heart, he began to make greater preparations than
before. About the beginning of the Spring <hi>Anthony</hi> set Sail from <hi>Athens,</hi>
and arrived at <hi>Tarentum</hi> with three hundred Sail, to assist <hi>Caesar</hi> according
to his promise; but <hi>Caesar</hi> having now changed his mind, would now stay
till the Ships, building for him were in a readiness. And when he was
urged to employ <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Fleet, which was sufficient to put an end to this
War, he excused himself that he was engaged in other Affairs: which
made it apparent, he either had some new cause of quarrel with <hi>Anthony,</hi>
or else scorn'd his assistance, contenting himself with his own Forces.
Though <hi>Anthony</hi> was offended at this proceeding, yet he staid still in the
same place, and sent to him once more; for whereas his Fleet lay at a great
charge, and he stood in more need of Italian Soldiers for the Parthian
War, he had thoughts of changing his Fleet for Legions. Though by the
League each had power of raising Men in <hi>Italy;</hi> but because it was fallen
to the others division, he imagined it would be more difficult for him.
Wherefore <hi>Octavia</hi> her self came to <hi>Caesar</hi> to be as it were Arbitress be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. He told her, that being deserted by <hi>Anthony,</hi> he had been
in danger of losing his life in the Sicilian Strait. She answered, that had
been already discoursed and declared to <hi>Maecenas.</hi> He then objected that
<hi>Anthony</hi> had sent <hi>Callias</hi> his Freed Man to <hi>Lepidus</hi> to make a League toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
against him. To which she answered, that to her knowledge, <hi>Callias</hi>
was sent to <hi>Lepidus</hi> to treat a Match; for <hi>Anthony</hi> being about to go to the
Parthian War, would before his departure have his Daughter married to
<hi>Lepidus</hi>'s Son, according to his promise. <hi>Octavia</hi> affirming this, and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
sending <hi>Callias</hi> to <hi>Caesar</hi> to torment him, if he pleased, and know the
truth from his own mouth: he would not receive him, but sent word he
would meet <hi>Anthony</hi> between<note n="*" place="margin">Tore de Mare.</note> 
                  <hi>Metapontum</hi> and <hi>Tarentum,</hi> and discourse
with him himself. Through the place appointed runs a River, called like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<hi>Metapontum:</hi> and they both by chance arriving at the same time,
<hi>Anthony</hi> lighting out of his Chariot, leaps alone into a little Skiff he found
there, to go meet <hi>Caesar,</hi> confiding in him as his Friend; <hi>Caesar</hi> emulating
that Generosity, did the same; so meeting in the middle of the River,
they disputed a long time who should go to the other side; at length <hi>Caesar</hi>
prevailed, having resolved to go to <hi>Tarentum</hi> to see <hi>Octavia;</hi> he therefore
mounts with <hi>Anthony</hi> in his Chariot, lights at his Lodgings, and without
any Guards, lies there all night. <hi>Anthony</hi> on the morrow repays him with
the same confidence, so sudden were their changes, ambition of Empire
raising reciprocal Jealousies, and the necessity of their Affairs obliging
them to confide in each other. <hi>Caesar</hi> then put off the War against <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
to the next year; but <hi>Anthony</hi> not thinking fit longer to delay the War
against the Parthians, they made an exchange, <hi>Anthony</hi> gave <hi>Caesar</hi> sixscore
Ships, which he forthwith delivered him, and <hi>Caesar</hi> promised to send him
twenty thousand Legionary Soldiers: <hi>Octavia</hi> likewise gratified her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with ten Galliots (a sort of Vessel between a Galley and a Ship of
Burthen) which she begged of <hi>Anthony,</hi> and he in return gave a thousand
chosen Men for Guards, which <hi>Anthony</hi> himself picked out. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the time of the Triumvirate was near expired, they prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it for five other years, without staying for the suffrage of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
so they parted, <hi>Anthony</hi> making with all diligence towards <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:65196:265"/>
leaving <hi>Octavia,</hi> and a little Daughter they had, with her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, whether that <hi>Menodorus</hi> were naturally perfidious,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIV"/>
or that he was fearful of <hi>Anthony,</hi> who had threatened him with Shakles
as his Fugitive Slave, or were not rewarded to his expectation, or else
moved with reproaches of his infidelity, which <hi>Pompey</hi>'s other Freed Men
(after the death of <hi>Menecrates</hi>) continually loaded him with, exhorting
him to return to his duty, he demanded safe conduct, which being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, he returned into <hi>Pompey</hi>'s service with seven Vessels, whilst <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,
Caesar</hi>'s Admiral perceived nothing of it; wherefore <hi>Caesar</hi> took away
his Command, and gave it to <hi>Agrippa.</hi> After that <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Fleet was finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he purged it in this manner, Altars were erected in the Sea a little off
the Shore, the Ships with all their Crews aloft in a profound silence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in order before them, the Priests sacrificed standing in the water, then
placed the Victimes in a Pinnace, with which they rowed thrice round the
Fleet, accompanied in other Boats by all the principal Commanders, all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
praying, that if the Fleet were threatned with any misfortune, it
might fall upon the Victimes, which after dividing in two, they cast one
part into the Sea, and burnt the other on the Altars, whilst all the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
made their Prayers. And this is the form the Romans use in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of their Fleets. It had been resolved, that <hi>Caesar</hi> parting from <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teoli,
Lepidus</hi> from <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>Taurus</hi> from <hi>Tarentum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> should invade <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi>
with three several Fleets, to encompass the Enemy on three sides of
the Island, East, West and South; and that to this end, <hi>Caesar</hi> should
give notice to the others what day he would embarque, which was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on the tenth of the Summer Solstice, which the Romans call the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lends
of the Month formerly called <hi>Quintilis,</hi> and since named <hi>Iuly</hi> in the
Honour of the first <hi>Caesar,</hi> which day he pitched upon, judging it would
prove fortunate, because his Father had thereon been always victorious.
As for <hi>Pompey,</hi> he opposed to <hi>Lepidus Plenius</hi> with one Legion, and store
of other Infantry at the point of <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> fortified the Sea Coasts of the
Island to the East and West, and more particularly the Islands of <hi>Lipari</hi>
and<note n="*" place="margin">Pantalarea:</note> 
                  <hi>Cossyra,</hi> lest they should prove Ports of Retreat, <hi>Cossyra</hi> to <hi>Lepidus,</hi>
and <hi>Lipari</hi> to <hi>Caesar,</hi> from whence they might at all times assault <hi>Sicily.</hi> All
his best Forces he rendezvouzed at <hi>Messina,</hi> that they might be in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to march where-ever there should be occasion. The two Chieftains
being in this manner provided, and the first day of <hi>Iuly</hi> come, <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
Party all embarqued about break of day. <hi>Lepidus</hi> set sail out of <hi>Africa</hi>
with a thousand Vessels of Burthen, and seventy Galleys, twelve Legions,
five thousand Numidian Horse, and all things necessary for their subsistence.
<hi>Taurus</hi> from <hi>Tarentum</hi> with one hundred and two Ships, of the hundred
and thirty <hi>Anthony</hi> had left <hi>Caesar</hi> the Rowers of the rest being dead of
the Plague the last Winter. And <hi>Caesar,</hi> from <hi>Puteoli,</hi> having first sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
in the Admiral, and thrown the Entrails into the Sea, that the winds
might be fair, <hi>Neptune</hi> propitious, the Sea calm, and all favourable to
him against his Father's Murderers. Some Ships went before to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ound the
depth of Water, and <hi>Appius</hi> with good Forces brought up the Rear.
The third day after their embarquing it blew very hard at South, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of <hi>Lepidus</hi>'s Vessels of Burthen foundred, yet he reached <hi>Sicily,</hi>
where he besieged <hi>Plenius</hi> in <hi>Lilybaeum,</hi> and took several places, some by
force, and some by surrender. <hi>Taurus</hi> as soon as it began to blow returned
back to <hi>Tarentum. Appius</hi> as he doubled the Cape of <hi>Minerva</hi> lost one
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65196:266"/>
part of his Squadron, another part were driven upon the Flats, and the
rest dispersed here and there with great loss. <hi>Caesar</hi> at the beginning of
the Storm got to Anchor with all his Ships in the Gulf of <hi>Elaea</hi> in safety, all
but only one Galley of six Oars to a Bank, which was cast away near the
adjoyning Promontory, but the Wind on a sudden clapping about to the
West, to which this Gulf lies open, they were sorely battered with the
Tempest, for the Wind blowing right in, they could neither get-out, nor
ride there. In vain they plyed their Oars, and in vain let drop their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors,
they were driven upon the Rocks, or fell foul of one another, besides
night coming on, made the danger much more dreadful. At length the
storm being blown over, <hi>Caesar</hi> caused the dead to be buried, the wounded
dressed, and cloathed those who had cast themselves into the Sea to save
their lives, giving them other Arms, and immediately issued orders to refit
his Fleet, as well as he could for the present, he had lost six great Ships,
two and twenty lesser, and a great number of<note n="*" place="margin">Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</note> Liburnicks. Thirty days
it required besides to repair the damage this storm had done, and Summet
was far advanced; wherefore he found it convenient to put off the War
till the next year. Mean while, because the People were put to hard shifts
for want of Provisions, he presently caused his Ships to be drawn ashore
to refit, sent those Seamen had escaped the storm to <hi>Taurus,</hi> who wanted
them, and fearful lest this disaster should work some change in the minds
of those who had not yet lost the memory of the great <hi>Pompey,</hi> he sent
<hi>Maecenas</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> whilst himself went through all <hi>Italy</hi> from Colony to
Colony, assuring the Veterans there was no fear of any thing, and then
passed to <hi>Tarentum,</hi> to see in what condition <hi>Taurus</hi>'s Fleet was, and thence
to <hi>Vibone,</hi> where he encouraged his Legions, and hastened with such dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
his Naval Preparations, that in a short time he was ready to make
a second attempt upon <hi>Sicily.</hi>

he suffered himself to be called, as perswaded the Enemy had not been
thus twice battered by Tempest in Summer time, without divine assistance.
'Tis likewise reported, that puffed up with this success, he changed his
Coat of Arms, which was of Purple, and took Blew, as the adopted Son
of <hi>Neptune.</hi> He hoped after so many losses <hi>Caesar</hi> would lie quiet; but
when he heard he had refitted his Fleet, and was ready to come into <hi>Sicily</hi>
that very Summer, his heart failed him, thinking he had to deal with a
Man whose courage was invincible, and whose treasure inexhaustible, yet
he sent <hi>Menodorus</hi> with the seven Ships that he had brought him to discover
in what readiness <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Fleet were, and do what else he could. But he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
that he was not restored to the Command of the Fleet, and perceiving
they trusted him with no more than his own seven Ships, because they
had a jealousie of him, resolved once more to change sides. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
imagining, that whatever happened, it would be for his advantage to
do some brave and valiant action, he distributed all the Money he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his companions, and having in three days come seventy five Furlongs,
he falls like a Thunderbolt among the Guard-ships of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Fleet, where
they were at work, then going off, and upon a sudden falling on again, he
carried away sometimes two, and sometimes three, he engaged likewise
either in their Ports, or upon the Sea, with several Ships loaden with Corn,
some of which he sunk, others burnt, and took others, and in short, filled
all the Coast with terrour and tumult, both <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Agrippa</hi> being absent,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65196:266"/>
the last gone into the Forest to provide Timber. So bold he grew<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he
came to an Anchor in a Shoal Bay, where he lay as if he had been fast in
the Ouz, till the Enemies running down from the Mountains as to an assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Prey; tacking about, he rowed off, laughing at, and deriding them,
to the grief and astonishment of the whole Army. After he had thus made
known of what importance it was to <hi>Caesar</hi> to have him for a Friend or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
he gave liberty to a Senator, called <hi>Rebilus,</hi> who he had before ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that he might go before and prepare matters, raising a report among
his People, that they should ere long have a Fugitive of consequence, which
was <hi>Vinidius Marcellus,</hi> an intimate Friend of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s, whose affection he
himself had gained, when he before quitted <hi>Pompey</hi>'s service, and after
that drawing near to the Enemy, and desiring to have some conference
with <hi>Vinidius,</hi> in a certain Island, touching an Affair of Importance to
both Parties. Having obtained it, when they were alone he told him,
that when he left <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Party to go to <hi>Pompey,</hi> he had been forced to it
by the injuries he dayly received from <hi>Calvisius</hi> then Admiral; but that
now <hi>Agrippa</hi> had the Command of the Navy, he was ready to return to
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s service, of which he could not complain, provided <hi>Vinidius</hi> would
bring him a safe conduct from <hi>Messala,</hi> who in <hi>Agrippa's</hi> absence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Fleet, promising by some signal Action to repair his fault.
However, till he had his safe Conduct, he must, to avoid suspicion, make
War upon <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Party as before. <hi>Messala</hi> at first scrupled the doing it,
as dishonourable, yet at length he granted it, whether yielding to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities
of the War, or before well informed of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s mind, or that he
foresaw he could not be displeased at it. So <hi>Menodorus</hi> once more changed
Parties, and going to <hi>Caesar</hi> cast himself at his Feet, begging pardon for
his fault, without telling what obliged him to commit it. <hi>Caesar</hi> pardoned
him because of <hi>Messala's</hi> word passed to him, but gave orders narrowly to
watch him, and permitted the Officers of his Galleys to go whither they
pleased.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Fleet being now ready he came to <hi>Vibona,</hi> where he gave order <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVI"/>
to <hi>Messala</hi> to pass over into <hi>Sicily</hi> with two Legions to joyn <hi>Lepidus</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and that he should land in the Gulf against <hi>Tauromenia:</hi> he sent three
likewise to <hi>Stylida,</hi> which is the very extremity of the Strait, to wait a fair
opportunity, and commanded <hi>Taurus</hi> to sail about with his Fleet from <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentum</hi>
to the Promontory of <hi>Scyllace,</hi> which is directly opposite to <hi>Tauro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia.</hi>
He came prepared to fight both on Sea and Land; for his Land
Army followed him, before whom marched his Horse, with orders to
make discoveries from the Land, as the Liburnick Brigantines did at Sea.
As he was advancing in this manner, <hi>Caesar</hi> came; and after having seen
him near <hi>Scyllace,</hi> and approved the order he kept, returned to <hi>Vibona:
Pompey,</hi> as we have said, had placed good Garrisons in all places of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland
where any Forces might land, and kept his Fleet at <hi>Messina,</hi> ready to
go and relieve who stood in need. Whilst these Preparations were made
on both sides, <hi>Lepidus</hi> having sent for out of <hi>Africa</hi> for the remainder of his
Forces, which consisted in four Legions, <hi>Papia,</hi> one of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
met them in open Sea; and whilst they staid for him as a Friend,
gave them chace, they took them for the Ships <hi>Lepidus</hi> was to send to meet
them; and indeed he did send, but coming out too late, when the Ships of
Burthen saw them, they took them for Enemies, and would not approach
them, whereas now staying for <hi>Papia,</hi> some were taken, some burnt,
some sunk, and others recovered <hi>Africa,</hi> of the four Legions two perished
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65196:267"/>
in the Sea, and if any Soldiers saved themselves by swimming, <hi>Tisienus,</hi>
another of <hi>Pompey</hi> Lieutenants, caused them to be massacred as fast as
they came on shore. The rest of the Army came either now or afterwards
to <hi>Lepidus,</hi> and <hi>Papia</hi> returned to <hi>Pompey. Caesar</hi> with all his Fleet passed
from <hi>Vibone</hi> to <hi>Strongyle,</hi> one of the five Aeolian Isles, and seeing on the
Coast of <hi>Sicily</hi> great store of Forces at <hi>Pelora, Miles,</hi> and <hi>Tyndari,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<hi>Pompey</hi> was there in person, wherefore leaving <hi>Agrippa</hi> his Admiral
in the Post, he returned to <hi>Vibone,</hi> and soon after joyned with <hi>Messala,</hi>
with design to lay hold of the opportunity of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s absence to surprise
<hi>Tauromenia,</hi> and so fall upon him two several ways. <hi>Agrippa</hi> therefore,
goes from <hi>Strongyle</hi> to <hi>Hiera,</hi> and driving out the Garrison takes the
place, resolving next day to attempt<note n="*" place="margin">Melazzo</note> 
                  <hi>Miles,</hi> and <hi>Demochares</hi> the Admiral
who lay there with forty Ships; wherefore <hi>Pompey</hi> fearing <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
sent other forty Ships from <hi>Messina</hi> to <hi>Demochares,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Apollophanes</hi> another of his Freed Men, who was followed by
<hi>Papia</hi> with seventy others. <hi>Agrippa</hi> before day weighed with half his
Ships, as if he were only to fight with <hi>Papia,</hi> whom he had some intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
he might meet; but when he saw <hi>Apollophanes</hi>'s Fleet followed by
another of seventy Sail, he sent presently to give notice to <hi>Caesar</hi> that <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>
was at <hi>Miles</hi> with the greatest part of his Naval Force, and placing
himself in the middle of his great Ships, sent to the rest at <hi>Hiera</hi> with all
speed to follow him. These two Ships thus magnificently equipped, and
having Towers in Poop and Prow, being come up with each other, after
with Signals given, and their Men encouraged to do well, charged
with great violence, some stem and stem, and others standing off to gain
their Enemies Broad-side, and fall on with greater terrour, great was the
noise made by the Ships shocking against each other, and greater the
Shouts of the Men. <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Ships were middle sized, light, and easie
to go about, and so much more active against the Enemy, and by their
swiftness fit to take all advantages in boarding; but <hi>Caesar</hi>'s being greater
and heavy, were of consequence much less nimble, but on the contrary,
stronger, both to give the Shock, and abler to receive it. <hi>Caesar</hi> had the
best Soldiers, and <hi>Pompey</hi> the most skilful Mariners; wherefore these
charged not right forwards upon <hi>Caesar</hi>'s great Ships, but shearing by them,
sometimes broke a whole Gang of Oars, and sometimes carried away
their Rudders, and sometimes likewise suddenly bringing about, they
charged them with their Beak Heads, giving no less a Shock than they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:
but when <hi>Caesar's</hi> Ships could reach any of these light timbered
Vessels, they pressed upon them so furiously with their Beak Heads, that
they either staved them, or bored them through and through; and if
they came at any time to fight Board and Board, the great Ships miserably
knocked them down with missile Arms thrown from aloft, and casting in
their Grapnels, easily stopped them, so that the service being too hard to
be born, the Adversary had no way to save themselves, but by leaping into
the Sea, where Skiffs appointed for that purpose took them up. Mean
while, <hi>Agrippa,</hi> whose main design was upon <hi>Papia</hi>'s Ship, gave him so
cruel a Shock in the Bow, that he sunk him, for he opened all his Kell,
and those in his Fore-Castle presently fell, and the Water entring, all the
lower Bank of Rowers were drowned, the rest upon Planks saved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by swimming: <hi>Papia,</hi> received into the next Ship, again renews
the Fight. When <hi>Pompey,</hi> who from the top of a Mountain saw that his
People could very hardly defend themselves, and that they never came near
any of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Ships, but they lost Men, and that the rest in <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65196:267"/>
Fleet whom he left at <hi>Hiera</hi> were coming to his assistance, made a Signal
for them to retreat, which by little and little they did, still fighting, but
being close pressed upon, they fled, not into the Ports, but the Rivers
Mouths, where the Mud and Sand brought down by the constant stream
makes Shoal Water, wherefore <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s Pilots advising him not to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
his great Ships upon those Flats, he came to an Anchor in sight of
them in the open Sea, as if he designed to attack them in the Night;
but his Friends admonishing him not to be ruled more by anger than reason,
nor to over-harass the Soldiers by too great Labour and Watchings, nor
yet to be too confident of the calmness of the Sea, he retreated towards the
Evening, and <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Ships got into Harbour. They lost in this Battel
thirty of their Ships, and sunk five of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s, besides many other losses
which they as well as the Enemy sustained. <hi>Pompey</hi> commended them for
having so well defended themselves, having to fight not against Ships but
Walls, nor were his rewards less than if they had been victorious: he gave
them hopes, that fighting in the Strait as their Light Ships would easier
stem the Current, so they would certainly be victorious, promising withal
to add somewhat to the heighth of their Ships. Such was the success
of the Battel between <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Papia</hi> near <hi>Melazzo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After which <hi>Pompey</hi> judging what indeed was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Caesar</hi> was gone to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVII"/>
                  <hi>Taurus</hi>'s Camp, because he had a design upon <hi>Tauromenia,</hi> as soon as he
had supped he set Sail for <hi>Messina,</hi> leaving at <hi>Melazzo</hi> a part of his Ships,
to make <hi>Agrippa</hi> believe he was still there. <hi>Agrippa</hi> on the other side ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given a little repose to his Men, sailed towards <hi>Tyndari,</hi> which had
promised to surrender; where he was received by the Inhabitants, but the
Garrison defended it so generously, that they drove him thence, yet some
other Towns revolting to him, received his Garrisons, and towards Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he returned to the Fleet. Mean while, <hi>Caesar</hi> being well assured that
<hi>Pompey</hi> was gone from <hi>Messina</hi> to <hi>Melazzo</hi> because of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> came from
<hi>Scyllace</hi> to <hi>Leucopetra,</hi> from whence he resolved to pass by Night to <hi>Tauro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia;</hi>
but after he heard the success of the Sea-fight, he changed his
mind, believing he need not conceal his embarquing, but boldly go on in
broad day, for he imagined <hi>Pompey</hi> would not come far from <hi>Agrippa.</hi>
Day then beginning to appear, he took a view from the Mountains as far as
his sight could reach into the Sea, and spying none of the Enemies Ships
he went on Board, loading his Ship with all the Soldiers he could stow;
and leaving the rest with <hi>Messala</hi> till the Ships returned to fetch them:
being come near <hi>Tauromenia,</hi> he summoned the place, but the Garrison
refusing to surrender, he passed beyond the River <hi>Onobola,</hi> and the Temple
of <hi>Venus,</hi> and landed near <hi>Archigetes,</hi> where having made his prayers to
the Gods, he encamped to besiege <hi>Tauromenia;</hi> now <hi>Archigetes</hi> is a small
Statue of <hi>Apollo,</hi> which the Naxians, when first sent a Colony into <hi>Sicily,</hi>
dedicated. There as <hi>Caesar</hi> set foot on ground he fell, but soon got up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
he was beginning to work upon the Circumvallation of the Camp
when they saw <hi>Pompey</hi> coming with a great Fleet, to the astonishment
of all the Army, who thought him quite ruined by <hi>Agrippa:</hi> along the
Shore likewise came Horsemen, riding, striving in swiftness to out-pass
the Fleet; and in several parts were seen great Bodies of Foot. <hi>Caesar</hi>'s
People seeing themselves thus surrounded by three Armies, were utterly
dismayed, <hi>Caesar</hi> himself was afraid, because he could not now have the
assistance of <hi>Messala.</hi> The Horse first fell among <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Men still em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in their Trenches. And if the Fleet and the Foot had come on at
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65196:268"/>
the same time, perhaps <hi>Pompey</hi> had gained an important Victory, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unskilful in military Affairs, and ignorant of the fear their Enemies
were in, loth to come to a Battel in the Evening, they retreated, the
Fleet to the Promontory of <hi>Coccyna,</hi> and the Foot, who durst not lodge
near <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Camp, to the Town of <hi>Phoenissa,</hi> whilst the night following
the lay quiet, the Caesarians fortified their Camp, but with extreme labour
and watching had made themselves utterly unfit to fight; they were three
Legions, five hundred Horsemen without Horses, about a thousand light
armed Foot, and two thousand Veteran Voluntiers, besides the Sea-Forces.
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s left with <hi>Cornificius</hi> all the Land Forces, with order to defend himself
as well as he could, and before day himself embarqued, left he should like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
be shut in by Sea. He placed <hi>Titinius</hi> on the Right, and <hi>Cancius</hi> on
the Left, and himself in a Brigantine went from one part of the Fleet to the
other, exhorting all Men to do their best; and after that (as being in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of danger) struck his Flag. <hi>Pompey</hi> presently coming to assault
him, they charged though twice, and the Fight lasted till Night. But
<hi>Caesar</hi>'s Ships were many burnt and sunk, and many of them setting their
small Sails, fled towards the Coast of <hi>Italy</hi> contrary to, and in contempt
of Orders, some of <hi>Pompeys</hi> Ships pursued them, and soon putting them
in disorder, took or burnt them as well as the rest, those that swum ashore
were either slain or taken by <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Horsemen, some few escaping to
<hi>Cornificius</hi>'s Camp, who sent only his light armed Foot to receive them;
for he did not think it convenient to go out with his Legions, in that ill po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
wherein they were, whilst a Land Army of the Enemies lay so nigh,
whom the success at Sea had pussed up, as is ordinary after Victory. <hi>Caesar</hi>
rowed a great way in the night in a small Galley, deliberating with
himself, whether he should endeavour to pass through the midst of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
and get again to <hi>Cornificius,</hi> or go to <hi>Messala.</hi> At length by good
fortune he reached the Port of <hi>Abala,</hi> where he landed with one Esquire,
destitute of Friends, Servants or Guards, whom some that were come up
to the Mountains to see how things stood, found afflicted both in
Body and Mind, whom changing from Boat to Boat that they might the
better deceive the Enemy, they at length brought to <hi>Messala</hi>'s Camp,
which was not far distant. As soon as he got thither, before he would
take any food, he dispatched a Brigantine to <hi>Cornificius,</hi> and sent to all parts
of the Mountains to let those they found there know he was in safety, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertizing
them to prepare to relieve <hi>Cornificius;</hi> and he wrote to <hi>Cornificius</hi>
that he would suddenly be with him, and bring him relief. After he had
eat a little, and taken some small repose, he went by night to <hi>Stylida,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyed
by <hi>Messala</hi> to find out <hi>Carinas,</hi> who being ready to sail with three
Legions, he gave him order to pass over to <hi>Lipari,</hi> and there stay for him;
and writ likewise to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> that considering the danger <hi>Cornificius</hi> was in,
he should with all speed send to him <hi>Laronius</hi> with the best of his Forces.
He likewise sent <hi>Mecaenas</hi> the second time to the City, upon intelligence
they were contriving some Novelty, the Authors of which were publickly
punished: and <hi>Messala</hi> he sent to <hi>Puteoli,</hi> where the first Legion lay to
bring them to <hi>Vibone.</hi> This was that <hi>Messala</hi> who was proscribed at <hi>Rome</hi>
by the Triumvirs, with promise of rewards both of Money and Liberty
to those should slay him; and who escaping to <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cassius,</hi> after their
death delivered up on Composition their Fleet to <hi>Anthony:</hi> which I the
rather mention in this place as a great example of Roman Virtue, since
<hi>Messala</hi> having now in his power him who proscribed him, without atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
and in a deplorable condition, received him as his General, and
saved his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:65196:268"/>
As for <hi>Cornificius,</hi> though he could have defended himself in his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVIII"/>
Trenches, yet being straitned for want of Provision, he drew out to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
the Enemy to sight: but <hi>Pompey</hi> would not hazard the fortune of a
Battel against People had nothing but their Arms to trust to, and whom
he hoped to reduce by Famine; yet <hi>Cornisicius</hi> having placed those escaped
from the Sea-Fight, and who were without Arms in the midst of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
marches on, sorely infested in the Plain by the Horsemens missile
Arms, and by the African Foot in places inaccessible for the Horse, who
being lightly armed, though he sent off several Parties to engage them,
he could do no good against them. The fourth day of his March he came
upon a dry ground, which the Inhabitants thereabout call <hi>The Torrent of
Fire,</hi> reaching quite to the Sea, all waters falling on it being evaporated
with the very heat of the ground, so that the People thereabouts never
travel over it but by night to avoid the heat and dust. <hi>Cornificius</hi>'s Men not
knowing the Country durst not, especially in a dark Moon, adventure to
pass by night, for fear of an ambush; and by day they could not defend
themselves from their Enemies, heat and dust suffocated them, and the
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orching ground (being now in the heat of Summer) tormented the
soles of their Feet, especially those were naked; thirst no less afflicted
them, not suffering them to retard their March to go charge those light
armed Foot who continually infested them; so that they were exposed to
wounds, without making any defence. At last, when they drew near to
a Strait at the end of this burning ground, they met with other Enemies;
wherefore leaving behind their sick, and such as could not fight, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
furiously to the Charge, and gained the Pass; but when they saw
before them other Straits which the Enemy was likewise possessed of, they
lost all heart, and made a stop, being quite spent with thirst, heat and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
yet when <hi>Cornificius</hi> perswaded them to take courage, by telling
them there was a Fountain close by, they renewed the Fight, and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
loss of theirs drove the Enemy from the Post, but other Enemies
were still Masters of the Fountain, so that now they gave themselves over
to grief and despair. In this extremity <hi>Laronius</hi> appeared afar off with
three Legions which <hi>Agrippa</hi> had sent to their relief, they were not fully
assured he was their Friend; however, the sight put them in some hopes,
especially when they saw the Enemy desert the Fountain, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enclosed on both sides, then they began to set up Shouts of Joy, which
<hi>Laronius</hi> having answered, they ran all to the Fountain, where notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the good counsel of their Officers to make them more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
they drank so excessively, that some of them died upon the
place.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Cornificius</hi> when he was quite past hopes saved himself and the rest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIX"/>
of the Army, and went and joyned with <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who in the mean time
had taken <hi>Tyndari,</hi> furnished with good store of Provisions, and so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
for this War, that <hi>Caesar</hi> landed there all his Horse and Foot, which
were no small number, for he brought into <hi>Sicily</hi> one and twenty Legions,
twenty thousand Horse, and more than five thousand light armed Foot.
<hi>Pompey</hi> still held <hi>Melazzo, Maulochus, Pelora,</hi> and all that Sea-Coast
with good Garrisons, who out of the fear they were in of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> kept
continually Fires, as if they would burn the Ships that approached them.
He was likewise seised of the Passages from <hi>Tauromenia</hi> to <hi>Melazzo,</hi> and
had fortified all the Avenues of the Mountains; so that he kept <hi>Caesar</hi> at a
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65196:269"/>
Bay (who had a design to enlarge his Quarters beyond <hi>Tyndari</hi>) and yet
adventured not a Battel. But having advice that <hi>Agrippa</hi> was about to
land at <hi>Pelora,</hi> he hastened thither, deserting the Passes of <hi>Melazzo,</hi> of
which <hi>Caesar</hi> seised, and of <hi>Melazzo</hi> it self, together with <hi>Artemisia,</hi> a
little City, famous for the Oxen of the Sun, taken away by <hi>Ulysses</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
whilst he slept. But when the news of <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s coming proved
false, and <hi>Pompey</hi> heard of the Passes being lost, he sent for <hi>Tisienus</hi> with
his Army, whom <hi>Caesar</hi> going to meet, strayed out of his way about <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cono,</hi>
where he staid all night without any Tents, in a violent rain; as is
usual in Autumn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with no other covering save a Gallick Shield which the
Soldiers held over his Head. Here they heard the horrible noise and
dreadful roarings of Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> and beheld the mighty Flames, which
sorely affrighted the whole Army, especially the Germans, who starting
from the places where they were laid down, were no longer scrupulous of
believing the wonders told of Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> especially of the Torrents of
Fire. After this <hi>Caesar</hi> went and spoiled the Country of the Palestins,
where meeting with <hi>Lepidus,</hi> and being supplied with Corn, they went both,
and set down near about <hi>Messina.</hi> But when there happened only light
Skirmishes through all <hi>Sicily,</hi> and no memorable Fight, <hi>Caesar</hi> weary of
it, sent <hi>Taurus</hi> to cut off <hi>Pompey</hi> from Provisions, by seising upon those
Cities that supplyed them, which made him resolve to give Battel; but
because he was afraid of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Land Forces, and thought himself secure
in his Ships, he sent a Herald to offer him a Sea-Fight. Though <hi>Caesar</hi> of
all things abhorred to have do with Salt Water, where he had ever been
unfortunate; yet thinking it dishonourable to refuse any thing, he accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Challenge, and a day was appointed, when they were to meet
with three hundred Ships each, armed with all sorts of missile Arms,
Towers and Maohines that could be imagined. `Twas now <hi>Agrippa</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
the Harpagon, which is a piece of Timber of five Cubits long,
bound about with Iron, at each end having two Rings, at one of which is
the Harpago, or Hook of Iron, and at the other many Cords fastened in
Pulleys to draw it back, with a Catapulta or Sling to dart it forcibly into
the Enemies Ships.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXX"/> But the day of Battel being come, the whole Gang of Rowers began to
shew their skill, not without great Shouts and Acclamations, then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the flying of missile Arms, some thrown out of Engines, some out of
Hand, as Stones, Javelins, Arrows, Fire-brands, and flaming Darts, the
Ships run Board and Board, some in the Waste, some on the Bows, and
some ran with their Prows so fiercely at others, that they over-set those
stood on their Fore-Castles, and made their own Ships unserviceable. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lighter Vessels contented themselves only to skirmish, lancing as they
passed by unto each other Darts, Javelins, and other missile Arms, other
smaller were appointed to take up such as fell into the Sea. The Soldiers,
Rowers, and Seamen did wonders, assisted by the skill of the Pilots, heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the encouragements of the Commanders, and the continual play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Engines: but the Harpagon was most of all approved, being
light enough to fly at a distance into the Enemies Ships, it stuck fast, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when they drew it back with the Cords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they could not cut it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bound about with Iron Hoops; and the Cords they could not reach to,
because of its length, besides, this Machine being yet unknown, they
were not provided of any long Bills to cut the Ropes. There was but one
way in this unprepared condition they could think of, and that was by
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65196:269"/>
force of Oars to strive to get loose from it, but then the Enemy pulled up
too, both striving one way, the Harpagon still did its office; wherefore
coming to a close Fight, they leaped into one anothers Ships, and were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
so mixed together, that it was hard to know which party any were of,
for they wore all one kind of Habit, and most spoke the Latine Tongue;
and the Word for that day was known by both Parties. And in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
when no person trusting to anothers giving him the Word, if he did
not know him, there was a horrible Slaughter, and the Sea was presently
covered with Bodies, Arms, and Wracks of Vessels; for they left nothing
unattempted besides Fire, which after the first shock, and that they came
to fight Board and Board, they made no more use of. Both Armies from
the Shore beheld this dreadful Fight not without fear and passion, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them engaged for every one of their particular safeties; but how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
soever they were they could discern nothing; for it was impossible
in a long Train of six hundred Ships, from whom they heard shouts and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations,
sometimes from one side, and sometimes from the other, to
discover any thing distinctly. At length <hi>Agrippa</hi> judging by the Colours
upon their Towers, which was the only mark of difference between
them, that there were more of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Ships perished than theirs, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
those about him, as if already victorious, to renew the Charge, and
not give over pressi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g upon the Enemy, which they did, till those opposite
to him were first forced to give way; and beating down their Towers,
shewed him their Poops, and fled towards the Strait, to the number only of
seventeen Ships, most of the rest cut off by <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who got between
them and the Flyers from going the same way, run violently on Shore,
where sticking fast, they were either got off by the Enemy, or there
burnt, which those that were yet fighting in open Sea seeing, yielded.
The Caesarian Sea Forces soon proclaimed their Victory by their Shouts
and Acclammations, which were answered by the Land Army on Shore:
whilst <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Men groaned out of grief and despair. As for <hi>Pompey</hi>
himself, he departed in haste from <hi>Naulochus</hi> to go to <hi>Messina,</hi> so astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that he had no thoughts at all of his Land Army, which made them led
by <hi>Tisienus</hi> surrender to <hi>Caesar</hi> upon good conditions, which example was
likewise followed by the Horse perswaded by their Officers. There were
in this Battel three of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Ships sunk, and twenty eight of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s,
and all the rest burnt, taken, or split upon the Rocks, save only those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen
that fled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pompey,</hi> as upon the way he heard of the defection of his Army, laid <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXI"/>
down his Imperial Robe, and took a private habit, sending some before to
<hi>Messina,</hi> to load what they could upon his Ships, for he was prepared for
this a long time before, and sending to <hi>Plenius</hi> who was at <hi>Lilybaeum</hi> with
eight Legions to come presently to him, <hi>Plenius</hi> forthwith set forward,
but all his Friends, and all his Garrisons having yielded to the Conquerour,
and his Enemies being already in the Strait to come to <hi>Messina,</hi> he did not
think it convenient to stay for <hi>Plenius</hi> in the City, though it were a very
strong place, but embarquing upon those seventeen Ships he had, made
Sail towards <hi>Anthony,</hi> whose Mother he had favourably received in a like
misfortune, and <hi>Plenius</hi> arriving at <hi>Messina</hi> after <hi>Pompey</hi>'s departure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he there shut himself up, resolving to stand upon his defence. Now
after the Victory <hi>Caesar</hi> staying in his Camp near <hi>Naulochus,</hi> had given or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to <hi>Agrippa</hi> to go and besiege <hi>Messina,</hi> which together with <hi>Lepidus</hi> he
did. <hi>Plenius</hi> having sent out to them Deputies to capitulate, <hi>Agrippa</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:65196:270"/>
was of the mind to defer the business till next day that <hi>Caesar</hi> came thither;
but <hi>Lepidus</hi> himself received them upon composition, and to get the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of <hi>Plenius</hi> into his own possession, gave them share in the plunder of
the City equal with his own; so that besides pardon which they only asked
for, they had found a Booty they did not expect, they that very night
plundered the City with <hi>Lepidus</hi>'s Men, and delivered themselves up to be
his. So that <hi>Lepidus</hi> by this recruit beholding himself Master of two and
twenty Legions, and a brave Body of Horse, raised his hopes, and laid a
design upon seising upon <hi>Sicily.</hi> This project he founded upon his
first having landed in the Island, and having taken more Cities than <hi>Caesar;</hi>
wherefore he gave Command to his Garrisons not to receive any Forces
but his own, and seised upon all the Passages. On the morrow <hi>Caesar</hi>
being arrived at <hi>Messina,</hi> sends some of his Friends to <hi>Lepidus,</hi> to make
his complaint of these proceedings, and to represent to him that he was
come into <hi>Sicily</hi> only to serve <hi>Caesar,</hi> and not to conquer for himself. To
which he answered by a reciprocal complaint: That they had taken from
him his part of the Empire, which <hi>Caesar</hi> had usurped all to himself, and if
he would restore that, he would willingly part with <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Sicily. Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
angry at this answer, goes to him himself, reproaches him with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
and after some mutual threats they part, and from that instant
begin to keep Guard apart, and the Ships went and anchored at some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from the Port, because, as was reported, <hi>Lepidus</hi> had a design to
burn them; and the Soldiers detesting these Dissentions; believed they
were again falling into another Civil War. Not that they made any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of <hi>Lepidus</hi> with <hi>Caesar; Lepidus</hi>'s own Soldiers did not do that, they
admired <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Virtue, and blamed <hi>Lepidus</hi>'s baseness, thinking it a high
injustice done them, to equal the Vanquisher and the Vanquished in the
plunder of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssina. Caesar</hi> having notice of their thoughts sent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
to solicite them by his Agents, who gained many, especially of those
who had served under <hi>Pompey,</hi> for they thought the pardon granted them
ineffectual, unless <hi>Caesar</hi> confirmed it. <hi>Lepidus</hi> knew nothing of this
Negotiation, so that before he perceived any thing, <hi>Caesar</hi> comes unlooked
for to his Camp, with a strong party of Horse, which he left before the
Trenches, and entred with a slender Train, and advancing towards the
middle, calls all the world to witness that he was forced to make War
against his Will. The nearest to him having saluted him, calling him
Emperour, all <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Men who were made to the purpose ran to him,
and begged his pardon. To which he answered, that he wondered they
should ask pardon before they had done what they ought: they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
what he meant, and presently some took their Colours, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
them to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Camp, whilst the others made up the Tents. <hi>Lepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
hearing the Tumult, comes out of his Tent armed, and falls on, so
that one of <hi>Caesar's</hi> Esquires being slain, and <hi>Caesar</hi> himself shot with an
Arrow in the Corslet, though it went not to the quick, he got by running
to the place where he had left his Horse. As he ran, some of those who
were upon the Guard in one of the Forts at <hi>Lepidus</hi>'s Camp made a mock
of him; whereon he immediately fell upon that Fort, and took it with
his Horse. Those who commanded in the rest yielded, some at the same
time, others the night following, some without being summoned, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
after a slight assault made by the Cavalry to serve for a pretence of
their Surrender: but some there were who bravely stood to it before they
would submit; for <hi>Lepidus</hi> continually sent relief to all parts; but at last
these reliefs deserted him likewise; may, even those who had an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65196:270"/>
for him at first changed their minds. First, all those of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
who had till then stood firm for him, left him by whole Bands, and
when <hi>Lepidus</hi> caused others to take Arms to stop them, those thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
took their Colours, and carried them to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Camp with the
others. <hi>Lepidus</hi> threatened, intreated, stopped the Ensigns, and said
he would not suffer them to depart, till one of the Ensigns telling him
plainly, that he should suffer it either alive or dead, he was so terrifed
that he let them go. The Horse left him last: but before they parted,
they sent to ask <hi>Caesar</hi> whether he would have them kill <hi>Lepidus,</hi> whom
they acknowledged no longer for General; but he would by no means per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it. Thus <hi>Lepidus</hi> seeing himself unexpectedly, and in so short a time
deserted by so great an Army, and fallen from so mighty a Fortune;
changed Habit, and went to <hi>Caesar</hi> whither all the world run as to a
Spectacle. <hi>Caesar</hi> rose up to receive him, and would not suffer him to fall
on his Knees before him, but he sent him to <hi>Rome</hi> in the same Habit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to that of a private Man, without any power or quality, save that
of High Priest. So that this Man who had so often been General of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
had reigned in the Triumvirate, made so many Magistrates, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
so many of his Equals in Dignity, returned into the degree of a
simple Citizen, and spent the rest of his life submitted to authority, and to
the power of many of those he had proscribed.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Pompey, Caesar</hi> would not pursue him, nor permit it to be done,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXII"/>
whether he thought it not convenient to follow him into <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
or whether he had a mind to see what <hi>Anthony</hi> would do; for if he
did not as he ought, he had just occasion to break with him (for both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to Sovereign Power, either had a long time thought that when all
other were overcome they should fall upon one another) or else, as <hi>Caesar</hi>
said afterwards, because <hi>Pompey</hi> was none of his Father's Murderers.
All the Forces being now joyned together, there were five and forty Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
five and twenty thousand Horse, thirty seven thousand five hundred
light armed Foot, six hundred Ships of War, and a prodigious number of
Merchants Ships, all which he sent to their owners. He gave likewise to
the Soldiers the reward due to them for Victory, with promise of greater
Liberalities for the future, distributed Crowns, and other honourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenses
to those he thought worthy, and pardoned the Officers had
served under <hi>Pompey.</hi> This great Prosperity was worthy of Envy, and
Fortune was not wanting to be jealous of it, and to intermix it with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
for the Army, and particularly his own mutinied, the Soldiers demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Discharge, and to have the same Recompenses they had received
after the Victory at <hi>Philippi;</hi> whereupon, though the service they had
done against <hi>Pompey</hi> seemed not in his opinion comparable to the other, yet
he promised them to reward them honourably, and equal with those now
served under <hi>Anthony</hi> at his return, and yet according to Military Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
he represented to them with some threats the fault they committed
against the Laws of War, and against the Oath they had sworn to. At
length, seeing that instead of submitting they grew more insolent, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
threatning, lest those who were newly come to his Party should raise
some Tumult: only he told them he would discharge them with <hi>Anthony</hi> as
soon as he could, assuring them in the mean time he would no more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
them in Civil Wars, since they by God's Grace were quite extinct;
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65196:271"/>
but that he would lead them against the Illyrians, and other Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Nations who had broke the Peace with them, from whom they
would all return rich. To which they told him plainly, that they would
serve no longer, unless he presently gave them those Rewards and Honours
their past labours deserved. He answered them, that as to the Honours
there should be no delay in them; for besides the Crowns he had already
distributed, he had others to bestow among every Legion, and to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions
and Tribunes Robes of Purple, with the Quality of Senator, every
Man in his Country. Whilst he was offering these things and many others,
fit a Tribune named <hi>Ofilius</hi> began to cry out that Crowns and Robes were
to quiet Children, but that must have Soldiers Money and Lands. The multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
by their Acclammations signifying they approved this discourse, <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>
in a rage went down from the Tribunal; but for the Tribune those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him praised him, and reviled the others for not joyning with him,
he told them that he alone was sufficient to defend so just a cause, yet these
words cost him dear, for the next day he disappeared, and was never more
seen. After which accident no particular person durst utter a word, but
the whole Army went together to demand their Discharge, and <hi>Caesar</hi> for
his part did all he could to appease them by caressing their Officers. At
length he dismissed those had served him at <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Philippi,</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to twenty thousand, for indeed they had served longer than the
time appointed by the Laws of War; but for fear lest those should corrupt
others, he sent them presently out of the Island, after having told apart to
those had served him at <hi>Modena,</hi> that though he had discharged them, he
would not fail to satisfie what he had promised. As soon as they were ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
he drew the rest together to speak to them, where he took them for
witnesses of the perjury of the others, whom he called Runaways, because
they had forced a Discharge from him, praised those present for their side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
made them hope that ere long they should be discharged, and that so
rich, no one person should repent his having continued in the service,
and with all this he gave them five hundred Drams a Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXIII"/> After this Broil was over, he laid a Tribute of Sixteen hundred Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
upon <hi>Sicily,</hi> and settled there Pretors as well as in <hi>Africa,</hi> left an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
divided betwixt those two Provinces, sent <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Ships to <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>
and sending part of the rest of his Forces before him into <hi>Italy,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
himself with the other. When his return was known in the City,
the Senate gave him by Decree all the Honours imaginable, referring to
his discretion the accepting all, or as many of them as he pleased. All
the Senators, and likewise the People, crowned with Flowers, went a
great way to meet him, brought him first to the Temple, and then to his
House. The next day he recited in full Senate, and before the People, two
Orations which he had composed, and which he afterwards made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
wherein he orderly declared what things he had done, and his
Conduct in the Government of the Common-wealth, from his first un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
the Charge till now, caused the Peace to be published,
the Civil Wars being now quite extinct, remitted what was remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
due upon Impositions, discharged the Receivers of what they
ought, and released the Farmers of what they had not yet payed in
of their publick Farms. Of all the Honours the Senate offered him
he accepted the noblest, that on all those days whereon he had been
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65196:271"/>
victorious, there should be Anniversary Festivals. That there should
be placed before the Tribunal for Orations his Statue in Gold, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
the life, with this Inscription,
<q>For Peace after tedious War, restored both by Sea
and Land.</q>
Besides all this, the People would have taken away <hi>Lepidus</hi>'s High
Priesthood, and obliged him to accept it; but he refused it, because
the Laws forbid the depriving a man of that Dignity, as long he
lived; whereupon the People would have <hi>Lepidus</hi> put to death, as
his Enemy, but he would not permit it. Afterwards he sent to all
his Armies sealed Letters, with Directions they should be all broken
up in one day, and the Orders they found in them observed, which
were concerning the Slaves, who, during the Tumult and Disorders,
had run away from their Masters, and lifted themselves in the Army.
The Senate had granted them all Freedom by the Peace made with
<hi>Pompey;</hi> but they being now taken all in one day, and sent to the
Cities, <hi>Caesar</hi> return'd them into the hands of their Masters, or their
Masters Heirs, and if none came to claim them, they were put to
death in the same Cities from whence they had fled: the like he did
in <hi>Sicily.</hi> All Men now thought the Civil Wars quite at an end, and
that they owed the obligation of it to <hi>Caesar,</hi> then twenty eight years
of age; wherefore the Cities consecrated him, and placed him in the
number of their Gods. Mean time, not only <hi>Rome,</hi> but likewise
<hi>Sicily</hi> was infested with numbers of Vagabond Rascals who robbed
with so much insolence, that <hi>Caesar</hi> was forced to give a Commission
to <hi>Sabinus</hi> to suppress them, many he took and hanged; but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
a whole years time to purge all the Countrys clear of them.
At this time, as it is said, were established those Cohorts of Watch
and Ward which continue to this day. This timely and speedy reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
got <hi>Caesar</hi> much reputation, who now began likewise to appoint
many annual Magistrates in things that concerned the Administration
of the Common-wealth, according to the custom of their Ancestors,
he likewise caused to be burnt all Letters writ in the time of the
War, lest they might kindle new Troubles, and promised to restore
the Government to the People, as soon as <hi>Anthony</hi> returned, because
he knew well that he had designed to lay down his Authority as soon
as the Civil Wars were ended. Upon these promises, the Citizens
perswaded of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s good intentions, made him perpetual Tribune of
the People, as if by this new Dignity they would invite him to lay
down the former: about which he privately wrote to <hi>Anthony,</hi> giving
his Letters in charge to <hi>Bibulus,</hi> who was upon his return to him, to
deliver; he sent likewise Governours into the Provinces, and made
Preparations for the Illyrian War, whither he designed to go in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Pompey,</hi> having left <hi>Sicily</hi> to seek a refuge from <hi>Anthony,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXIV"/>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:65196:272"/>
he landed on the Promontory of <hi>Lacinia,</hi> where he took out of <hi>Iuno</hi>'s
Temple all the Offerings of an inestimable value. Thence getting to
<hi>Mitylene,</hi> he sojourned some time in that City, where his Father in the
War with <hi>Caesar</hi> and left him then a Child with his Mother, and whither
after his Defeat he retreated. <hi>Anthony</hi> being at this time in <hi>Media</hi> fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against the Medes and Parthians, <hi>Pompey</hi> resolved to throw himself
into his Arms at his return, but hearing he was defeated, and that news pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
for a truth in the opinion of all the world, he began to fancy new
hopes, that either he might succeed <hi>Anthony,</hi> if he were dead, or share
power with him if he return'd, besides he was encouraged by <hi>Labienus</hi>'s
example, who but a little before had made strange Incursions and Spoils
throughout all <hi>Asia.</hi> Whilst these things run in his Head, news was
brought him that <hi>Anthony</hi> was returned to <hi>Alexandria;</hi> wherefore pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
the resolution he had taken, he sent Deputies to offer him his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Alliance; but this was but a Trick, for indeed they went only to
pry into his Affairs. In the mean time he privately dispatched others to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Princes of <hi>Thrace</hi> and <hi>Pontus,</hi> resolved to retire towards the
Kingdom of <hi>Pontus</hi> into <hi>Armenia,</hi> if he obtained not what he pretended to
from <hi>Anthony,</hi> for he had likewise sent to the <hi>Parthians,</hi> out of hopes that
in the War which was not yet terminated, they would be glad to accept
him for his General against <hi>Anthony,</hi> being a <hi>Roman,</hi> and more, the Son of
the great <hi>Pompey.</hi> Besides he fitted up great store of Shipping, and kept
in Exercise his Sea-Forces, under pretence of being afraid of <hi>Caesar,</hi> or of
making these preparations for <hi>Anthonies</hi> service; But <hi>Anthony,</hi> who soon
perceived his designs, and sent <hi>Titius</hi> with all the Fleet and Army of <hi>Syria,</hi>
to oppose him with open Force, if he would make War, or to conduct
him Honourably, if he had any intention to come to him as a Friend. Now
<hi>Pompey's</hi> Deputies spoke to <hi>Anthony</hi> in this manner.</p>

Yet because he had rather live in Peace with you; or if there be
necessity to make War, fight under your Colours, he has sent us hither to offer you
his Friendship and Alliance. 'Tis not a desire of a days standing, you know that
when he was Master of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and made Inroads into <hi>Italy,</hi> when he sent
your Mother to you, he made you the same offers; And certainly had you accepted
them, neither had <hi>Pompey</hi> been driven out of <hi>Sicily.</hi> For you had not assisted
<hi>Caesar</hi> with your Fleet, nor you had not come off with such disadvantage against
the <hi>Parthians,</hi> because <hi>Caesar</hi> sent you not those Forces he promised you; Nay,
you might have reduced <hi>Italy</hi> to your Obedience. However, though you refused
them in a time when they might have been useful to you, he begs you yet to
have a care lest <hi>Caesar</hi> who has so often deceived you, do not do it at last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:65196:272"/>
upon <hi>Pompey,</hi> who was likewise his Aly, though he had not the same pretence.
How he has deprived <hi>Lepidus</hi> of his part of the Empire, without in the least
making you partaker of his Victories. You are now the only obstacle stands in
his way to that Monarchy to which he has so long aspired; and already, if

               </q>
               <p>The Deputies having done speaking, <hi>Anthony</hi> let them understand the
Orders he had given to <hi>Titius,</hi> and for a full answer told them, that if
<hi>Pompey</hi> made these Offers sincerely, he would come along with <hi>Titius.</hi>
In the mean time, <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Envoys to the Parthians were taken by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>'s
Captains, and brought to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> where having confessed all,
<hi>Anthony</hi> sent for the Deputies had spoke to him on <hi>Pompey</hi>'s behalf, and
shewed them whom he had arrested. They were extremely surprised;
yet they besought him to pardon a young Man reduced to the last extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and who out of a fear of being refused, had been forced to seek a
Retreat among Nations always Enemies to the Roman Name; for had
he been well assured of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s mind, there had been no need to
have had recourse to others, or to use other arts and solicitations, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
believed them, being by nature free from Malice, and of a clear
and magnanimous temper.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, <hi>Furnius, Anthony</hi>'s Lieutenant in <hi>Asia,</hi> made at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXV"/>
first no opposition against <hi>Pompey,</hi> who was come over thither in a
peaceable manner, whether he were not strong enough to hinder him,
or that he knew not <hi>Anthony</hi>'s mind; but when he saw he exercised his
Soldiers, he levyed what Force he could himself in that Province, and
sent to <hi>Aenobarbus,</hi> who was not far off with an Army, and to <hi>Amyntas</hi>
to come to his assistance. They being presently drawn together, <hi>Pompey</hi>
began to complain they treated him like an Enemy, whilst he was waiting
what answer <hi>Anthony</hi> gave his Deputies, yet all this while he was plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to make <hi>AEnobarbus</hi> his Prisoner, whom one of his Familiars called
<hi>Curius,</hi> was to deliver up to him, hoping he might stand him in good
stead, if an Exchange of Prisoners should happen; but the Treason
being discovered, and <hi>Curius</hi> convicted, he was executed by sentence of
the Council of War, and <hi>Pompey</hi> put to death <hi>Theodorus,</hi> one of his
Freed Men, who alone he made privy to this Plot, suspecting he had
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:65196:273"/>
discovered it. This design not succeeding, he lost all hopes of deceiving
<hi>Furnius,</hi> but he took by treason <hi>Lampsacus,</hi> where <hi>C. Caesar</hi> had planted
a Colony of Italians, whom by force of Money he got to engage in his
Party; so that seeing himself two hundred Horse, and three Legions
strong, he went and assaulted <hi>Cyzica</hi> by Sea and Land, but was both
ways repulsed by some of <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Forces, who had the Guard of the
Gladiators, kept there for the Peoples Divertisement. He therefore
returned to the Port of the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> to make Provision of Corn, whither
<hi>Furnius</hi> following, without offering to fight him, encamped always as
near him as he could with store of Horse, and thus hindred him from so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
the Country, or besieging Towns. <hi>Pompey,</hi> who had not Horse
enough to take the Fields, went and assaulted his Camp in Front with one
part of his Forces, against whom <hi>Furnius</hi> coming to the Charge, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
whohad taken a great compass not to be discovered, fell in behind,
forced the Camp, and put them all to the Rout. All <hi>Furnius</hi>'s Men fled
through the Plains of <hi>Scamandria,</hi> and not being able to run very fast, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the ground was moistned with the Rain, there was made a great
Slaughter. Those who saved themselves escaped into places of security,
being too weak to stand <hi>Pompey,</hi> till such time as new Recruits were come
from <hi>Mysia, Propontis,</hi> and other places. Mean while, the Country
People ruined with Taxes, took Arms, and joyned with <hi>Pompey,</hi> now
grown famous by the Victory, gained at the Port of the Achaeans. But
still wanting Horse, he often came by the worst in going to gather in
Corn and Forrage. Wherefore upon intelligence that a Body of Italian
Horse were coming to <hi>Anthony,</hi> which <hi>Octavia,</hi> who wintered at <hi>Athens,</hi>
sent him, he dispatched away some of his Agents with Money to corrupt
them; but the Governour of <hi>Macedon</hi> taking these Suborners, distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their Money to the Horsemen: yet <hi>Pompey</hi> took <hi>Nicea</hi> and <hi>Nicomedia,</hi>
where he got store of Wine, besides many other happy successes he had
beyond his own hopes: but <hi>Furnius</hi> always encamping at some distance
from him. About the beginning of Spring there came to him from <hi>Sicily</hi>
seventy Ships, the Remainder of the Fleet <hi>Anthony</hi> had lent to <hi>Caesar</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Pompey;</hi> for the Sicilian War being ended, <hi>Caesar</hi> returned them.
At the same time <hi>Titius</hi> arrived out of <hi>Syria</hi> with sixscore other Ships,
and a great Army, and all together landed at <hi>Proconesus.</hi> Thereupon
<hi>Pompey</hi> somewhat daunted, burnt his Ships, and armed his Rowers and
Seamen, whom he thought would do him better service on shore. But
<hi>Cassius</hi> of <hi>Parma, Nasidius, Saturninus, Thermus, Antistius,</hi> and all the
most considerable of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Friends, and even <hi>Fannius</hi> himself, for
whom he had the greatest value, and <hi>Libo</hi> his Father-in-law, seeing that
after the coming of <hi>Titius,</hi> to whom <hi>Anthony</hi> had given commission
either to make War or Peace, he was still obstinate to continue the
War against one more powerful than himself, left him, and making
their own composition submitted to <hi>Anthony:</hi> being deserted by his
Friends, he advanced through the mid-land of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> with design, as
'tis said, to get into <hi>Armenia: Furnius, Titius,</hi> and <hi>Amyntas</hi> having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that to this intent he had quitted his Camp by night, followed him,
and made such haste, that before day was shut in, they overtook him
near a certain Eminence, above which they encamped separately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
entrenching, because it grew late, and their Men were over tired.
<hi>Pompey</hi> seeing them in this posture, drew off three thousand Men,
who went and charged them in the dark night so briskly, that they
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:65196:273"/>
slew a great number, some in Bed, and others rising, and the rest for the
most part naked, shamefully took their flight: so that if <hi>Pompey</hi> had fallen
on with all his Forces, or had but given them chase, he might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted
his Victory, but his adverse fortune put it out of his thoughts, and
he reaped no more fruit of this Victory, save the continuing his March in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Uplands.</p>
               <p>The Enemies being rallied, followed him close at the Heels, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXVI"/>
very sorely tormented him, that being reduced to want of Provisions,
he desired a Conference with <hi>Furnius,</hi> Friend to the great <hi>Pompey,</hi> and
besides that, the most considerable of all the other Commanders, and
the honestest Man. Being in order thereunto come to the Bank of a
River that run between them, <hi>Pompey</hi> told them, that having sent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
to <hi>Anthony,</hi> and having in the mean time no Provisions, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> was angry at <hi>Titius,</hi> as an ungrateful Man, to undertake this
War against him whom he had so kindly treated when he was his
Prisoner; besides, he thought it dishonourable for <hi>Pompey</hi> to yield him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the hands of <hi>Titius,</hi> a man of mean extract, and whom he
was jealous of, either distrusting his Principles, or conscious of some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
he had done him before the last kindness; wherefore he offered
himself once more to <hi>Furnius,</hi> and begged him to receive him; and
when that could not be obtained, he desired that at least he might yield
himself into <hi>Amyntas</hi>'s Hands. But <hi>Furnius</hi> telling him that <hi>Amyntas</hi>
would not do that which would prove injurious to him who had <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>'s
Commission for this purpose, the Conference ended. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s
Lieutenants believed that <hi>Pompey</hi> would next morning for very want be
forced to yield himself to <hi>Titius;</hi> but as soon as it was night he caused
Fires to be kindled, and gave orders to the Trumpets to sound at every
Watch of the Night, according to custom, and he without any noise
went out of his Camp with the Flower of his Forces, not telling any
one of them his design, which was to return to the Sea, and set fire on
<hi>Titus</hi>'s Fleet, and possibly he might have done it, if <hi>Scaurus,</hi> who desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, and run to the Enemy had not given him notice of his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the way he had taken, without being able to say more. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myntas</hi>
presently followed him with fifteen hundred Horse, for whom,
<hi>Pompey</hi>'s being all Foot, it was no hard matter to overtake. As soon as he
appeared, all <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Men forsook him, some privily, others openly;
so that almost desperate, and fearing his own Domesticks, he yielded
himself to <hi>Amyntas</hi> without conditions, who had refused the Composition
offered by <hi>Titius.</hi> Thus was the last Son of the great <hi>Pompey</hi> taken.
He had lost his Father when he was a Child, and when he grew some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
elder, his Brother, after whose death he lay concealed a long time,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:65196:274"/>
living like a Bandito in <hi>Spain,</hi> till such time as a multitude of loose Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
understanding he was <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Son, slocked to him, and then he
began to over-run and plunder the Country. After the death of <hi>C. Caesar</hi>
having got a good Army, Ships and Money, he made a War, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Master of some Islands, after which he was created Admiral of
the Western Sea, and then sorely annoyed <hi>Italy,</hi> almost famishing his
Enemies, and forcing them to peace on his own Conditions: but what
is most considerable, in that dreadful time of Proscriptions at <hi>Rome,</hi> he
was the only Refuge of the Miserable, and saved many persons of
Quality, who were obliged to him for their return to their Country:
but as if Fortune had deprived him of Judgment, he never would give
the onset upon any Enemy, but lost many fair opportunities, content on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to defend himself. Such was the <hi>Pompey</hi> now taken. <hi>Titius</hi> received
an Oath from his Army in <hi>Anthony</hi>'s name, and sent him to <hi>Miletum,</hi>
where at forty years of age he put him to death, either because the
old injury had more power over him than Gratitude for a later kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or because he had <hi>Anthony</hi>'s Orders for it. Though some say <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
gave no such Order, but it was done by <hi>Plancus</hi> Governour of
<hi>Syria,</hi> who in Affairs of great Importance was wont to set <hi>Anthony</hi>'s
Hand and Seal. Others believe that <hi>Plancus</hi> indeed might write it, but by
private Orders from <hi>Anthony,</hi> who would not do it himself, because of
the name of <hi>Pompey;</hi> or for fear to displease <hi>Cleapatra,</hi> who esteemed
<hi>Pompey</hi> for his Father's sake: others say again <hi>Plan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ns</hi> did it of his own
accord, fearing <hi>Pompey</hi> might raise some new difference between <hi>Caesar</hi>
and <hi>Anthony,</hi> or that <hi>Cleopatra</hi> might fall in love with him. Let it be
how it will, after his death <hi>Anthony</hi> took another Expedition into <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia;</hi>
and <hi>Caesar</hi> went to make War against the Illyrians, who wasted
the Coasts of <hi>Italy,</hi> some of whom were never subject to the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
others cast off their Yoak in the time of the Civil Wars. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Illyrian Affairs are not so well known to me as to compose there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
a perfect Volume; and that likewise I cannot speak of them more
properly, than when writing of the time that Province was absolutely
reduced under the Roman Power; I have designed to refer it till I write
what passed under <hi>Augustus,</hi> and now only make a Summary to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
