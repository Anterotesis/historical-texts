         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>SINCE first that great Apostacy
took place in the Hearts &amp; Heads
of those who began even in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
days to depart from the Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Purity of the Gospel, as it was
then delivered in its primitive Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
and Integrity, innumerable have
been the manifold Inventions &amp; Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
the different and various No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Opinions, where-with man
(by giving way to the vain and airy I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations
of his own unf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>able Mind)
hath burdened the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43450:4"/>
So that indeed, first by Adding these
things, and afterwards by Equalling
them, if not Exalting them above
the Truth, they have at last come to
be substitute in the stead of it; so
that in process of time, Truth came to
be shut out of doors, and another thing
placed in the room thereof, having a
Shew &amp; Name, but wanting the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and Thing it self: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
it pleased God to raise up Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
for Himself almost in every
Age and Generation, who, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Discoveries they receiv'd,
bore some Testimony, less or more,
against the Superstition and Apostacy
of the Time; and in special manner
through the Appearing of that Light
which first broak forth in <hi>Germany</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
One Hundred and Fifty Years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,
and afterwards reach'd divers other
Nations; the Beast received a Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Wound, and a very great Number
did at one time Protest against, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43450:4"/>
Rescind from the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of their most gross and sensual
<hi>Doctrines</hi> and superstitious <hi>Traditions:</hi>
But alas! it is for matter of Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the Successors of these <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi>
are establishing and building up
in themselves that which their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were pulling down, instead of
prosecutiug and going on with so <hi>Good</hi>
and <hi>Honourable a Work,</hi> which will thus
easily appear.</p>
            <p>The generality of all <hi>Protestants</hi>
(though in many other things mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
rent and shatter'd among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
do agree in Dividing from
the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> in these Two Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That every Principle and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the <hi>Christian</hi>-Faith is, and
ought to be founded upon the Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and that whatsoever Principles or Doctrines
are not only not contrary, but even not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43450:5"/>
according thereto, ought to be deny<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, as
Antichristian.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are plain and easie to be understood;
and that every private <hi>Christian</hi> and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Church ought to read and peruse
then, that they may know their Faith and
Belief founded upon them, and receive
them for that Cause alone, and not because
any Church or Assembly has compounded and
recommended them; the choicest and most
pure of which they are oblieged to look upon
as Fallible.</p>
            <p>Now, contrary to this their known
and acknowledged Principle, they
do most vigorously prosecute and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
others with the like Severity
the <hi>Papists</hi> did their Fathers, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
things that are plainly set
down in the Scriptures, and for not
believing divers Principles for which
themselves are forc'd to recur to Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43450:5"/>
and can by no means prove from
Scripture; To shew which I shall not
here insist, having allotted a Chapter
for it in the Book it self, because to put
it here, would swell beyond the Bounds
of a Preface.</p>
            <p>Oh! how like do they shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
(I mention it with Regreet)
to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> of old, who
of all men most cryed up and exalted
<hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> boasted greatly
of being <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Children? And yet
those were they that were the greatest
Opposers and Vilifiers of Christ, to
whom <hi>Moses</hi> and all the Prophets gave
witness; yea, their chief Accusations
and Exceptions against Christ, was, as
being a Breaker of the Law and a Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer.</p>
            <p>Can there any Comparison run
more parallel, seeing there is now
found a People, who are greatly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted,
and bitterly reviled, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
as Hereticks by a Generation
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43450:6"/>
that cry up and exalt the Scriptures;
And yet this People's Principles are
found <hi>in Scripture,</hi> Word by Word,
though the most Grievous, and indeed
the Greatest Calumny cast upon them
is, That they vilifie and deny the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and set up their own Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
instead of them.</p>
            <p>To disprove which, this <hi>Catechism</hi>
and <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> is compiled, and
presented to thy Serious and Imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
View: If thou lovest the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
indeed, and desirest to hold the
plain Doctrines there delivered, and
not these Strained and Far-Fetched
Consequences, which men have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
thou shalt easily observe the
whole Principles of the People, called
QUAKERS, plainly couched in
Scriptute-Words, without Addition
or Commentary; especially in those
things their Adversaries oppose them
in, where the Scripture plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cideth
the Controversie for them,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43450:6"/>
without Nicities and School-Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
which have been the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
by which the World hath not
known God; and the Words which
have been multiplied without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
by which Counsel hath been
darkned.</p>
            <p>In the Answers to the Questions,
there is not one Word, that I know
of, placed, but the express Words
of Scripture: And if in some of the
Questions there be somewhat sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
of what in my Judgment is
the plain and naked Import of the
Words, it is not to impose my Sense
upon the Reader, but to make way
for the next Question, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
of the Matter's sake; I
shall leave it to the Reason of any
Understanding and Judicious Man,
who is not byassed by Self-Interest,
that great Enemy to True Equity, and
who in the least measure is willing
to give way to the Light of Christ in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43450:7"/>
his Conscience, if the Scriptures do
not pertinently and aptly answer to the
Questions.</p>
            <p>As I have upon serious Grounds
separated from most of the Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Catechisms heretofore pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished;
so, not without Cause, I
have now taken another Method:
They usually place their Confession
of Faith before the Catechism; I
judge it ought to be otherwise, in
regard that which is easiest, and is
composed for Children, or such as
are Weak, ought in my Judgment
to be placed first; it being most
regular to begin with Things that
are Easie and Familiar, and lead on
to Things that are more Hard and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate:
Besides, that Things be
more largely opened in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism,
and divers Objections an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
which are proposed in the
Questions, the Reader having past
through that first, will more perfectly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43450:7"/>
understand the Confession, which
consisteth mainly in positive Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Not long after I had received and
believed the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>estimony I now bear,
I had in my View both the Possibility
and Facility of such a Work; and
now after a more large and perfect
Acquaintance with the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
I found Access to allow some
Time to set about it; and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
been helped to Accomplish the
same.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but it might be enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by divers Citations, which are
here omitted, as not being at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
brought to my Remembrance:
Yet I find Cause to be Contented,
in that God hath so far assisted me in
this Work by his Spirit, that Good
Remembrancer; the Manifestation of
which, as it is minded, will help such
as Seriously and Conscientiously read
this, to find out and cleave to the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43450:8"/>
Approved of and Agreed unto by the
Truth, and also Establish and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
those who have already belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
Which of all things is most
earnestly Desired, and daily Pray'd for,

Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things
of God. For what man knoweth the things
of a man, save the Spirit of a man, which is
in him? Even so the things of God knoweth
no man, but the Spirit of God. Now, we
have received not the Spirit of the World, but
the Spirit which is of God, that we might know
the things that are freely given to us of God,

            <p>
               <hi>Question,</hi> SEeing it is by the Spirit that
Christ reveals the Knowledge
of God in things spiritual, is it by the Spirit
that we must be led under the Gospel?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> But ye are not in the Flesh, but in the
Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in
you. Now, if any man have not the Spirit of
Christ, he is none his.</p>
            <p>For, as many as are led by the Spirit of God,
they are the Sons of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9, 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> It is an Inward Principle then, that is to
be the Guide and Rule of <hi>Christians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> But the Anointing, which ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of him, abideth in you; and ye need
not that any man teach you, but as the same
Anointing teacheth you of all things, and is
Truth, and is no Lye; and even as it hath
taught you, ye shall abide in him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.
27.</p>
            <p>But as touching Brotherly Love, ye need
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43450:10"/>
not that I write unto you; for ye your selves

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> For this is the Covenant that I will make
with the House of <hi>Israel</hi> after those dayes,
saith the Lord, I will put my Laws into their
Mind, and write them in their Hearts; and I
will be to them a God, and they shall be to

               <hi>Q.</hi> Did Christ then promise, that the Spirit
should both abide with his Disciples, and be
in them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> And I will pray the Father, and he shall
give you another Comforter, that he may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
with you forever, even the Spirit of Truth,
whom the World cannot receive, because it
seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye

               <hi>A.</hi> Thou hast known the Holy Scriptures,
which are able to make thee wise unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

Scripture is given by Inspiration of God, &amp; is

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> I perceive there was a Generation of old
that greatly exalted the Scriptures, &amp; yet would
not believe, nor come to be guided by that the
Scriptures directed to, How doth Christ bespeak
such?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Do not think that I will accuse you to
the Father; there is One that accuseth you,

               <hi>Q.</hi> From what Scripture then come these
men to wrest an Opinion so contrary to Truth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> For the Children being not yet born,
neither having done any Good or Evil, that the
Purpose of God according to Election might
stand, it was said unto her, The Elder shall
serve the Younger, as it is written, <hi>Jacob</hi>
have I loved, but <hi>Esau</hi> have I hated, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.

               <hi>Q.</hi> I perceive in that Scripture it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said before the Children were born, The
Elder shall serve the Younger; These other
words (Jacob <hi>have I loved,</hi> Esau <hi>have I hated</hi>)
are mention'd out of the Prophet <hi>Malachie,</hi> who
wrote them many hundred years after both were

the Blessing, he was rejected, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.
16, 17.</p>
            <p>Q. But seeing that such allege, that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin that many, even Children
are damned; Doth not the Scripture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver, that

<hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin could Condemn?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> For if through the Offence of one many
be dead, much more the Grace of God, and
the Gift by Grace, which is by one Man, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ. Therefore as by the Offence of one,
Judgment came upon all men to Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
even so by the Righteousness of one the
free Gift came upon all men unto Justification
of Life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 15, 18.</p>
            <p>Q. That proves abundantly that Christ's Death
is of sufficient Extent to make up any Hurt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s
Sin brought upon Mankind: What is
then the Cause of Condemnation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He that believeth on him is not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned;
but he that believeth not is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
already, because he hath not believed in
the Name of the Only Begotten Son of God,
<hi>John</hi> 3. 18.</p>
            <p>And with all Deceivableness of Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:43450:22"/>
in them that perish, because they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
not the Love of the Truth, that they
might be saved. And for this Cause God shall
send them strong Delusions, that they should
believe a Lye, that they all might be damned
who believe not the Truth, but had Pleasure
in Unrighteousness, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>Q. Seeing it is so of a Truth according to the
Scripture's Testimony, that God has purposed
Love and Mercy to all, in the Appearance of his
Son Jesus Christ; Is the Gospel or Glad-Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
of this Salvation brought nigh unto all, by
which they are put into a Capacity of receiving

            <argument>
               <p>Concerning Faith, Justification, and
VVorks.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>Question,</hi> VVHat is Faith?</p>
            <p>A. Faith is the Substance
of things hoped for, and the Evidence of things
not seen, Heb. 11. 1.</p>
            <p>Q. Is Faith of absolute Necessity?</p>
            <p>A. Without Faith it is impossible to please
him; for he that cometh to God, must believe
that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them
that diligently seek him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
            <p>Q. Are we justified by Faith?</p>
            <p>A. Wherefore the Law was our School-Master
to bring us unto Christ, that we might
be justified by Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 24.</p>
            <p>Q. What is the Nature of this Faith that
availeth to Justification?</p>
            <p>A. For in Jesus Christ neither Circumcision
availeth any thing, nor Uncircumcision; but
Faith which worketh by Love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
            <p>Q. Are Works then necessary to Justification
as well as Faith?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:43450:27"/>
A. But wilt thou know, O Vain Man, that
Faith without Works is dead? Was not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
our Father, justified by Works when
he had offered <hi>Isaac,</hi> his Son, upon the Altar?
Seest thou how Faith wrought with his Works;
and by Works was Faith made perfect? And
the Scripture was fulfilled, which saith, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
believed God, and it was imputed to him
for Righteousness: He was called the Friend
of God. Ye see then how that by Works a
man is justified, &amp; not by Faith only, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.
20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
            <p>Q. If then both be equally required in Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
what are these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orks which the Apostle
excludes so much?</p>
            <p>A. By the Deeds of the Law there shall no
Flesh be justified in his Sight, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20.</p>
            <p>Q. But though we be not justified by the Deeds
of the Law, is not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s to exclude Boasting, that
the Grace of God may by exalted?</p>
            <p>A. For by Grace are ye saved, through
Faith, and that not of your selves, it is the Gift
of God; not of Works, left any man should
boast; for we are his VVork manship cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
in Christ Jesus unto good Works, <hi>Eph.</hi>
2. 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>Q. Are even the Works which are performed
by Grace excluded? are we never said to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
or justified by them?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:43450:28"/>
A. Not by Works of Righteousness which
we have done, but according to his Mercy he
saved us by the Washing of Regeneration and
renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed
on us abundantly through Jesus Christ, our
Saviour; That being justified by his Grace we
should be made Heirs, according to the Hope
of Eternal Life, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Q. I perceive then that to be justified by
Grace, is to be justified or saved by Regeneration,
which cannot exclude the Works wrought by
Grace and by the Spirit; How doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
add in the next Verse for the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this against these that Cavil about the
Law?</p>
            <p>A. This is a Faithful Saying, and these
things I will that thou affirm constantly, that
they which believed in God might be careful
to maintain good VVorks; these things are
good and profitable unto men: But avoid
Foolish Questions, and Genealogies, and
Contentions, and Strivings about the Law;
for they are unprofitable and vain, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.
8, 9.</p>
            <p>Q. Doth the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> that is so much
against justification by the Works of the Law,
speak any where else of being justified by the
Spirit?</p>
            <p>A. But ye are washed, but ye are sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43450:28"/>
but ye are justified in the Name of the
Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But since the Law gives not Power nor
Ability to obey, and so falls short of Justification;
Is there no Power under the Gospel by which the
Righteousness of the Law comes to be fulfilled
inwardly?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> For what the Law could not do, in that
it was weak through the Flesh, God sending
his own Son in the Likeness of sinful Flesh,
and for Sin condemned Sin in the Flesh; that
the Righteousness of the Law might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
in us, who walk not after the Flesh, but
after the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Seeing th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n there is Power in the Spirit,
is not Works through it a Condition upon which
Life is proposed under the New Covenant?</p>
            <p>A. For if ye live after the Flesh, ye shall dye;
but if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the
Deeds of the Body, ye shall live, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
            <p>Q. Do not the Apostles then frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Life to People upon Condition of Repentance
and other Works?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Repent ye therefore, and be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that your Sins may be blotted out, <hi>Acts</hi>
3. 19,</p>
            <p>And if Children, then Heirs of God and joynt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43450:29"/>
Heirs with Christ, if so be that we suffer
with him, that we also may be glorified toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17.</p>
            <p>It is a faithful Saying; For if we be dead
with him, we shall also live with him: If we
suffer, we shall also reign with him. If a man
therefore purge himself from these, he shall
be a Vessel unto Honour, sanctified and meet
for the Master's Use, and prepared unto every
good Work, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 21.</p>
            <p>Remember therefore from whence thou art
fallen, and Repent, and do the first Works:
or else, I will come unto thee quickly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
thy Candle stick out of his place, except
thou Repent, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> It appears clearly by these Passages, that the
Apostle excludes only our Righteousness, which
he elsewhere explains as being the Righteousness
of the Law from being necessary to Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and not such Works as the Law of the Spirit
of Life leads to, and are not so much ours as
Christ in us; are not such good Works rewarded,
though they require no absolute Merit, as being
the Fruits of free Grace, yet doth not God judge
according to them? and may they not be said to
have a Reward?</p>
            <p>A. But if a man be Just, and do that which
is Lawful and Right, and hath not eaten upon
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43450:29"/>
the Mountains, neither hath lift up his Eyes to
the Idols of the House of <hi>Israel,</hi> neither has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
his Neighbour's Wife, neither hath come
near to a Menstruous Woman, and hath not
oppressed any; but has restor'd to the Debtor
his Pledge, hath spoiled none by Violence,
hath given his Bread to the Hungry, and hath
covered the Naked with a Garment; he that
hath not given forth upon Usury, neither hath
taken any Increase, that hath with drawn his
Hand from Iniquity, hath executed True

            <p>Then <hi>Peter</hi> opened his Mouth, and said,
Of a Truth I perceive that God is no Respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter

            <p>The Righteous Judgment of God, who

            <p>

            <argument>
               <p>Concerning Perfection, or Freedom
from SIN.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>Question, I</hi> Perceive then by all these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
afore-mentioned, that
Christ, as well as he hath purchased Pardon for
our Sins, hath also obtained Power by which
we may even here be cleansed from the Filth of
them; may we expect then in this Life to be
freed from the Dominion of Sin?</p>
            <p>A. For Sin shall not have Dominion over
you, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
            <p>Q. For what Reason?</p>
            <p>A. For ye are not under the Law, but under
Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
            <p>Q. How cometh the Apostle then to cry out
and complain of Sin, saying, Who shall deliver
me from the Body of this Death? Doth he
speak that, as a Condition always permanent to
him and other Saints, or only that which he
had passed through? What saith he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:43450:31"/>
A. There is therefore now no Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to them which are in Christ Jesus, who
walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit;
for the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ
Jesus, hath made me free from the Law of
Sin and Death. Who shall separate us from
the Love of Christ? Shall Tribulation, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
or Persecution, or Famin, or Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or Peril, or Sword? (as it is written, For
thy sake we are killed all the Day long, we
are accounted as Sheep for the Slaughter)
Nay, in all these things we are more then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
through him that loved us. For I am
perswaded, that neither Death nor Life, nor
Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor
things present, nor things to come, nor Height,
nor Depth, nor any other Creature shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to separate us from the Love of God which
is in Christ Jesus, our Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 2, 35,
36, 37, 38, 39.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What saith that Apostle then unto such,
who taking Occasion from his words should plead
for Continuance in Sin for term of Life, and
think to be saved by the Imputative Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ, as being under Grace?</p>
            <p>A. What shall we say then? shall we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in Sin, that Grace may abound? God
forbid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>VVhat then? shall we Sin, because we
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43450:32"/>
are not under the Law, but under Grace?
God forbid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is not the Apostle then so far from sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that Condition, of being alwayes under
Sin, to be his own constant Condition, or that
of all the Saints, that he even supposes, many of
the then Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom he wrote, to
be free of it; How bespeaketh he them as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to this Matter?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> How shall we that are dead to Sin, live
any longer therein? Know ye not, that so
many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ,
were baptized into his Death; Therefore we
are buried with him by Baptism into Death,
that like as Christ was raised up from the dead
by the Glory of the Father, even so we also
should walk in Newnes of Life: For if we have
been planted together in the Likeness of his
Death, we shall be also in the Likeness of his
Resurrection; knowing this, that our Old Man
is crucified with him, that the Body of sin might
be destroyed, that henceforth we should not
serve Sin; for he that is dead is freed from Sin.
Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead
indeed unto Sin, but alive unto God through
Jesus Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Lord. Let not Sin therefore
reign in your mortal Body, that ye should obey
it in the Lusts thereof: Neither yield ye your
Members as Instruments of Unrighteousness
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:43450:32"/>
unto Sin; but yield your selves unto God, as
those that are alive from the Dead, and your
Members as Instruments of Righteousness
unto God. Know ye not, that to whom ye
yield your selves Servants to obey, his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
ye are to whom ye obey, whether of
Sin unto Death, or of Obedience unto Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:
But, God be thanked, that ye were
the Servants of Sin; but ye have Obeyed
from the Heart that Form of Doctrine which
was delivered unto you; being then made
free from Sin, ye became the Servants of
Righteousness: I speak after the manner of
men, because of the Infirmity of your Flesh;
For as ye have yielded your Members Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to Uncleanness &amp; to Iniquity, unto Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
even so now yield your Members Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to Righteousness unto Holiness: For
when ye were the Servants of Sin, ye were
free from Righteousness; What Fruit had ye
then in these things whereof ye are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed?
for the End of these things is Death.
But now, being made free from Sin, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Servants to God, ye have your Fruit
unto Holiness, and the End, Everlasting Life:
For the Wages of Sin is Death; but the Gift
of God is Eternal Life through Jesus Christ,

            <p>Q. Is it then possible to keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
            <p>A. My Yoak is easie, and my Burden is
light, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 30.</p>
            <p>For this is the Law of God, that we keep
his Commandments, and his Commandments
are not grievous, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
            <p>Q. Is it necessary then for Salvation to keep
the Commandments?</p>
            <p>A. Blessed are they that do his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that they may have Right to the Tree
of Life, and may enter in through the Gates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>Q. Do you understand by this Perfection that
any have so kept the Commandments, as never to
have sinned?</p>
            <p>A. If we say, that we have not sinned, we
make him a Lyar, and his Word is not in us,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
            <p>Q. Do you understand that those who are
perfect may say, they have no Sin; or only
that having sinned, and so having Sin, in
respect they once sinned, as the Apostle in the
Passage cited mentions? May they not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:43450:33"/>
thereof come to know Forgiveness
for the Guilt, but also Cleansing from the
Filth?</p>
            <p>A. If we say, we have no Sin, we deceive
our selves, and the Truth is not in us: If we
confess our Sins, he is faithful and just to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
us our Sins, and to cleanse us from all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
            <p>Q. That Scripture seems to be very plain,
being compared with the other before-mentioned:
But because some are apt to mistake and wrest
the Words of that Apostle, what saith he else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where?
Did he judge, any could know God, or
be True <hi>Christians,</hi> who keeped not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments?</p>
            <p>A. My little Children, these things write
I unto you, that ye sin not; and if any man sin
we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ, the Righteous: And hereby do we
know that we know him, if we keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.
He that saith, I know him, and
keepeth not his Commandments, is a Lyar,
and the Truth is not in him: But whoso keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Word, in him verely is the Love of
God perfected. Hereby know we that we are
in him. He that saith he abideth in him, ought
himself also to walk even as he walked. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
now are we the Sons of God, &amp; it doth
not yet appear what we shall be; but we know
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43450:34"/>
that when he shall appear, we shall be like him;
for we shall see him as he is: And every man
that hath this Hope in him, purifieth himself
even as he is pure. Whosoever committeth
Sin transgresseth also the Law; for Sin is the
Transgression of the Law. And ye know that
he was manifested to take away our Sins, and
in him is no Sin: Whosoever abideth in him
sinneth not: Whosoever sinneth hath not
seen him, neither known him. Little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
let not man deceive you; he that doth
Righteousness is Righteous, even as he is
Righteous. He that committeth Sin is of the
Devil; for the Devil sinneth from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
For this purpose the Son of God was
manifested, that he might destroy the Works
of the Devil. Whosoever is born of God
doth not commit Sin, for his Seed remaineth
in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born
of God. In this the Children of God are
manifest, and the Children of the Devil;
whosoever doth not Righteousness is not of
God, neither he that loveth not his Brother,

               <hi>Q.</hi> It is very plain by these Passages that the

            <p>A. Not every one that saith unto me <hi>Lord,
Lord,</hi> shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,

these sayings of mine, and doth them, I will
liken him unto the Wise Man, which built his
House upon a Rock, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 21, 24.</p>
            <p>If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye

            <p>Q. What saith the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Needfulness of this thing?</p>
            <p>A. Circumcision is nothing, and Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
is nothing; but the keeping of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 19.</p>
            <p>Q. Was not this according to the Apostle
<hi>Paul's</hi> Judgment, the very Intention of Christ,
to have his Church and Children to be pure and
without Spot?</p>
            <p>A. According as he hath chosen us in him,
before the Foundation of the World, that we
should be Holy and without Blame before him
in Love, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
            <p>Even as Christ also loved the Church, and
gave himself for it, that he might sanctifie
and cleanse it, that he might present it to
himself a Glorious Church, not having Spot
or Wrinckle, or any such thing; but that
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43450:35"/>
it should be Holy and without Blemish, <hi>Eph.</hi>
5. 25, 26, 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> press the same thing
further, besides the other Passages above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned?</p>
            <p>A. Having therefore these Promises,
Dearly Beloved, Let us cleanse our selves
from all Filthiness of the Flesh and Spirit,
perfecting Holiness in the Fear of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>

            <p>To the End he may establish your Hearts

            <p>And the very God of Peace sanctifie you

Q. Is not this then the very End for which
God appointed Teachers in his Church?</p>
            <p>A. And he gave some Apostles, and some
Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some
Pastors and Teachers, for the Perfecting of
the Saints, for the Work of the Ministry, for
the Edifying of the Body of Christ, till we
all come in the Unity of the Faith, and of the
Knowledge of the Son of God, unto a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Man unto the Measure of the Stature of
the Fulness of Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Q. Seeing this is so much pressed by the Holy
Men, doth not the Scripture, which cannot lye,
give none of the Saints this Testimony, as being
free from Sin at sometimes, and so not alwayes
and daily sinning, as is supposed?</p>
            <p>A. <hi>Noah</hi> was a Just Man, and Perfect in his
Generations; and <hi>Noah</hi> walked with God,
<hi>Ger.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
            <p>And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou
considered my Servant <hi>Job,</hi> that there is none
like him in the Earth, a Perfect and an Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Man, that feareth God and escheweth
Evil, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 8.</p>
            <p>There was in the dayes of <hi>Herod,</hi> King of
<hi>Judea,</hi> a certain Priest named <hi>Zacharias,</hi> of the
Course of <hi>Abja;</hi> and his Wife was of the
Daughters of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and her Name was <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth,</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:43450:36"/>
and they were both Righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, walking in all the Commandments
and Ordinances of the Lord blameless, <hi>Luke</hi>
1. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Q. That proves sufficiently as to particular
Persons; But what doth the Scripture intimate
of this nature even of considerable Numbers?</p>
            <p>A. But God, who is rich in Mercy, for his
great Love, wherewith he hath loved us, even
when we were dead in Sins, hath quickened us
together with Christ, and hath raised us up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
and made us sit together in Heavenly
Places in Christ Jesus, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6.</p>

            <p>Q. Albeit then among true Christians every
one that believeth is to have the Witness in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:43450:41"/>
being perswaded in himself by the Spirit; yet
is there not also a real Subjection to be to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
in the Lord?</p>
            <p>A. The Spirits of the Prophets are subject to
the Prophets 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 32.</p>
            <p>Obey them that have the Rule over you, &amp;
submit your selves; for they watch for your
Souls, as they that must give Account, that they
may do it with Joy, and not with Grief; for
that is unprofitable for you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.</p>
            <p>And we beseech you Brethren, to know
them which labour among you, and are over
you in the Lord, and admonish you; and to
esteem them very highly in Love, for their
VVorks sake, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>Likewise, ye younger, submit your selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Elder; yea, all of you be subject one to
another, and be cloathed with Humility; for
God resisteth the Proud, and giveth Grace
unto the Humble, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How ought true Teachers to minister in
the Church?</p>
            <p>A. As every Man hath received the Gift,
even so Minister the same one to another, as
good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God.
If any speak let him speak as the Oracles of
God: If any Man minister, let him do it as
of the Ability which God giveth, that God in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:43450:41"/>
all things may be glorified, through Jesus
Christ, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> I perceive then, that every true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Church of Christ is, to minister of the
Gift and Grace of God, which he hath received:
But some are of the Judgment, that Natural
Wisdom or Parts, and human Learning are the
Qualifications, which are of absolute Necessity
for a Minister; but Grace they judge not to be
so absolutely necessary, but that one may be à
Minister without it; What saith the Scripture
in this Case?</p>
            <p>A. A Bishop must be Sober, Just, Holy,
Temperate, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Q. Methinks it is impossible for a Man to
be Blameless, Just, Holy, Sober and Temperate
without the Grace of God: So that if these
Qualifications be absolutely necessary, then sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that without which a man cannot be so qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,
must be necessary also: But what saith
the Scripture, as to the Necessity of Natural
Wisdom and Human Learning?</p>
            <p>A. Where is the Wise? Where is the
Scribe? Where is the Disputer of this World?
Hath not God made foolish the Wisdom of
this World? For after that in the Wisdom of
God, the World by Wisdom knew not God,
it pleased God by the Foolishness of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43450:42"/>
to save them that believe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.
20, 21.</p>
            <p>Q. It seems then the Preachings of the true
Ministers are not gathered together by Wisdom
and Learning: It hath been supposed, that a
Man must be greatly skilled in Learning, to
make a good Sermon; what is the Apostles Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Case?</p>
            <p>A. For Christ sent me not to baptize, but
to preach the Gospel; not with Wisdom of
Words, lest the Cross of Christ should be
made of none Effect, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17.</p>
            <p>And I was with you in Weakness, and in
Fear and in much Trembling; and my Speech
&amp; my Preaching was not with enticing Words
of Man's VVisdom, but in Demonstration of
the Spirit and of Power, that your Faith should
not stand in the VVisdom of Men, but in the
Power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Q. I perceive the Apostle layes far more
Stress upon the Demonstration and Power of the
Spirit in a Preacher, then upon human Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
ought Ministers then to preach as the
Spirit teacheth them?</p>
            <p>A. Also we speak not in the Words which
Man's Wisdom teacheth, but which the holy
Ghost teacheth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
            <p>And they were all fill'd with the holy Ghost,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:43450:42"/>
and began to speak as the Spirit gave them
Utterance, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 4.</p>
            <p>Q. Is it Christ then that speaketh in and
through his Ministers?</p>
            <p>A. For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit
of your Father, which speaketh in you, <hi>Mat.</hi>
10. 20.</p>
            <p>For it is not ye that speak, but the holy
Ghost, <hi>Mark</hi> 13. 11.</p>
            <p>For the holy Ghost shall teach you in the
same Hour, what ye ought to say, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 12.</p>
            <p>Since ye seek a Proof of Christ speaking in
me, which to you ward is not weak, but is
mighty in you, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3.</p>
            <p>Q. What is the Apostle's Mind of that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Learning, which some cry up so much, and
think so needful in a Minister?</p>
            <p>A. Beware, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t any Man spoil you through
Philosophy and vain Deceit, after the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Men, after the Rudiments of the World,
and not after Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Timothy,</hi> keep that which is committed
to thy Trust, avoiding prophane and vain Bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and Oppositions of Science, falsly so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6. 20.</p>
            <p>Q. Though true Ministers speak not by the
natural Wisdom of Man; yet is their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
altogether void of Wisdom?</p>
            <p>A. Howbeit, we speak Wisdom among
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:43450:43"/>
them that are perfect; yet not the Wisdom of
this World, nor of the Princes of this World,
that come to nought; but we speak the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God in a Mystery, even, the hidden
Wisdom, which God ordained before the
World to our Glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Q. What is the Reason that Man by his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Wisdom is not capable to minister in the
Things of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> For what Man knoweth the Things of a
Man, save the Spirit of a Man, which is in him?
Even so the Things of God knoweth no Man,
but the Spirit of God: But the natlural Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth
not the Things of the Spirit of God;
for they are Foolishness unto him; neither can
he know them, because they are spiritually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerned,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11, 14.</p>
            <p>Q. These Scriptures do sufficiently hold forth,
that the true Call to the Ministry is from God;
that which maketh a true Minister, is the Gift
and Grace of God; that the true and effectual
Preaching of a faithful Minister, is such, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
from the inward Teaching and Leading of the
Spirit of God: But what say the Scriptures
touching the Maintenance of Ministers?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Let him that is taught in the VVord,
communicate unto him that teacheth in all
good Things, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6.</p>
            <p>If we have sown unto you spiritual Things
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:43450:43"/>
is it a great Matter if we shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eap your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Things? If others be Partakers of this
Power over you, are not we rather? Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
we have not used this Power but suffer
all Things, lest we should hinder the Gospel of
Christ: Do ye not know, that they which
minister about holy Things, live of the Things
of the Temple; and they which wait at the
Altar, are Partakers with the Altar; even so
hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach
the Gospel, should live of the Gospel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
9. 11, 12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>For the Scripture saith, Thou shalt not mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle
the Ox that treadeth out the Corn; and
the Labourer is worthy of his Reward, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
5. 18.</p>
            <p>Q. I perceive by these Scriptures, that there
lyeth an Obligation upon the Saints, to help with
outward Things such as truly minister unto them
spiritual; but this seems to be voluntary;
ought not therefore true Ministers to preach,
whether they be sure of this or not? What saith
the Apostle of himself in this Case? and what
adviseth he others?</p>
            <p>A. But I have used none of these Things;
neither have I written those Things, that it
should be so done unto me; for it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for me to dye, then that any Man should
make my Glorying void; for though I preach
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43450:44"/>
the Gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for
Necessity is laid upon me, yea, Wo is unto
me if I preach not the Gospel: For if I do
this Thing willingly, I have a Reward; but
if against my Will a Dispensation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
is committed unto me, what is my Reward
then? Verely, that when I preach the Gospel,
I make the Gospel of Christ without Charge,
that I abuse not my Power in the Gospel, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>I have coveted no Man's Silver, or Gold, or
Apparel; yea, ye your selves know that these
Hands have ministred unto my Necessities,
and to them that were with me. I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you all Things, how that so Labo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ring ye
ought to support the Weak, and to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the Words of the Lord Jesus, how he said,
It is more blessed to give, then to receive, <hi>Acts</hi>
20. 33, 34, 35.</p>
            <p>Q. Its observable that the Apostle every
where makes special mention among the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of Teachers, that they be not given to
Filthy Luchre; What ought we then to think of
these Teachers as will not preach without Hire;
yea, that will by Violence take from those who
receive no Spirituals from them? are they like
to be the Ministers of Christ? or what else saith
the Scripture of such?</p>
            <p>A. Yea, they are greedy Dogs, which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43450:44"/>
can never have enough; and they are Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds

Thus saith the Lord God unto the Shepherds,
Wo be to the Shepherds of <hi>Israel,</hi> that do
feed themselves: Should not the Shepherds
feed the Flock? Ye eat the Fat, and ye cloath
you with the Wool, ye kill them that are fed;
but ye feed not the Flock.</p>
            <p>As I live, saith the Lord God, Surely because
my Flock became a Prey, and my Flock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Meat to every Beast of the Field, because
there was no Shepherd: Neither did my Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
search for my Flock; but the Shepherds

            <p>Thus saith the Lord concerning the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

that putteth not into their Mouthes, they even
prepare WAR against him: The Heads there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

Prophets; Are there none such from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles?</p>
            <p>A. Perverse Disputings of men of corrupt
Minds, and destitute of the Truth, supposing
that Gain is Godliness, from such withdraw
thy self; But Godliness with Contentment is
great Gain: For we brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

World, and it is certain we can carry nothing
out; and having Food and Rayment, let us
therewith be content. But they that will be
Rich, fall into Temptation and a Snare, and
into many foolish and hurtful Lusts, which
drown Men in Destruction and Perdition; For
the Love of Money is the Root of all Evil,
which while some coveted after, they have
erred from the Faith, and pierced themselves
through with many Sorrows 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 5, 6,

Damnable Heresies, even Denying the Lord
that bought them, and bring upon themselves
swift Destruction; And many shall follow their
Pernicious Wayes, by Reason of whom the
Way of Truth shall be Evil spoaken of. And
through Covetousness shall they with feigned
Words make Merchandize of you, whose
Judgment now of a long time lingereth not,
and their Damnation slumbreth not: Having
Eyes full of Adultery, and that cannot cease
from Sin, beguiling unstable Souls; an Heart
they have exercised with Covetous Practices.

            <p>Now we know, that God heareth not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Sinners; but if any Man be a Worshipper of
God, and doth his Will, him he heareth,
<hi>John</hi> 9. 31.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:43450:48"/>
And this is the Confidence that we have in
him. that if we ask any Thing, according to
his VVill, he heareth us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> After whae Manner doth the Apostle
then declare he will Pray?</p>
            <p>A. What is it then? I will pray with the
Spirit, and I will pray with the Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
also: I will sing with the Spirit, and I
will sing with the Understanding also, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
14. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Must we then pray alwayes in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?</p>
            <p>A. Praying alwayes, with all Prayer and
Supplication in the Spirit, and VVatching
thereunto with all Perseverance and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for all Saints, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Since we are commanded to pray alwayes
in it, can we do it of our selves without the Help
thereof?</p>
            <p>A. Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities:
for we know not what we should
pray for as we ought; but the Spirit it self
maketh Intercession for us with Groanings,
which cannot be uttered. And he that search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Hearts, knoweth what is the Mind of
the Spirit, because he maketh Intercession for
the Saints, according to the Will of God,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26, 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> I perceive, that without the Leadings and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43450:48"/>
Help of the Spirit, Prayers are altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable;
may not a Man truly utter these
Things that are Spiritual, without the Spirit's
Assistance?</p>
            <p>A. VVherefore I give you to understand,
that no Man speaking by the Spirit of God,
calleth Jesus <hi>Accursed;</hi> and that no Man can
say, that Jesus is the <hi>Lord,</hi> but by the Holy
Ghost, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> That is strange: It seems the Spirit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
much more necessary then many called <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
suppose it to be; some of which can scarce
give a good Account, whether they have it, or
want it: But if a Man speak Things true
upon the Matter, are they not true as from him,
if spoaken without the Spirit?</p>
            <p>A. And though they say, The Lord liveth,
surely they swear falsly, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> It is apparent from all these Scriptures,
that the true Worship of God is in Spirit; and
as it is not limitted to a certain Place, neither to
any certain Time, what shall we think of them
that plead for the Observation of certain Dayes?</p>
            <p>A. But now, after that ye have known
God, or rather, are known of God, how
turn ye again to the weak and beggarly Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

            <p>Let no Man therefore judge you in Meat or

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Seeing it is so, may not some <hi>Christians,</hi>
as lawfully esteem all Dayes alike, as others
may esteem some Dayes above another? What
Rule giveth the Apostle in this Case?</p>
            <p>A. One Man esteemeth one Day above
another, another esteemeth every Day alike;
let every Man be fully perswaded in his own
Mind: He that regardeth a Day, regardeth
it unto the the Lord; and he that rega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

He that eateth, eateth to the Lord; for he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
God Thanks; and he that eateth not to
the Lord, he eateth not, and giveth God
Thanks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But is it not convenient and necessary
that there be a Day set apart to Meet and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> even so do ye upon the

which was <hi>John</hi>'s Baptism, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

of eating Bread, and drinking Wine in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of him?</p>
            <p>A. For I have received of the Lord that
which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord
Jesus, the same Night in which he was betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
took Bread, &amp; when he had given Thanks,
he brake it, and said, Take, eat; this is my

Appointments positivelycommanded, yea,
and Zealously and Conscientiously practised by

that ye should do as I have done to you
<hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 14, 15.</p>

               </gap>rden then
these necessary Things, that ye abstain from
Meats offered to Idols, and from Blood, and
from Things strangled, and from Fornication;
from which if ye keep your selves, ye shall
do well; farewell, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 28, 29.</p>
            <p>Is any man sick among you, let him call for

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> These Commands are no less positive then
the other, yea, some of them are asserted as the
very Sense of the Holy Ghost, as no less ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
then abstaining from Fornication; and
yet the Generality of <hi>Protestants</hi> have laid them
aside, as not of perpetual Continuance: But
what other Scriptures are there, to shew that it
is not necessary, that of Bread and Wine to
Continue?</p>
            <p>A. For the Kingdom of God is not Meat
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43450:52"/>
and Drink; but Righteousness, and Peace, and
Joy in the Holy Ghost, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17.</p>
            <p>Let no Man therefore judge you in Meat or
in Drink, or in respect of an Holy Day, or
of the New Moon, or of the Sabbath Dayes:
Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the
Rudiments of the World, why, as though
living in the World, are ye subject to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
(touch no, taste not, handle not,
which all are to perish with the Using) after the
Commandments and Doctrines of Men? <hi>Col.</hi>
2. 16, 20, 21, 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> These Scriptures are very plain, and say
as much for the abolishing of this, as to any Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
as ought can be alledged for the former:
But what is the Bread then wherewith the Saints
are to be nourished?</p>
            <p>A. Then Jesus said unto them, Verily,
verily, I say unto you, <hi>Moses</hi> gave you not
that Bread from Heaven; but my Father gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
you the True Bread from Heaven; for the
Bread of God is he which comes down from
Heaven, and giveth Life unto the World. Then
said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us
this Bread? And Jesus said unto them, I am the
Bread of Life; he that cometh to me, shall
never H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

shall never Thirst. I am that Bread of Life:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43450:52"/>
Your Fathers did eat Manna in the Wilderness,
and are Dead; This is the Bread which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
down from Heaven, that a man may eat
thereof, and not dye. I am the Living Bread
which came down from Heaven; If any man
eat of this Bread, he shall live forever: and the
Bread that I will give him, is my Flesh, which
I will give for the Life of the World. The <hi>Jews</hi>
therefore strove amongst themselves, saying,
How can this man give us his Flesh to eat?
Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I
say unto you, Except ye eat the Flesh of the
Son of Man, and drink his Blood, ye have no
Life in you: Whoso eateth my Flesh, and
drinketh my Blood, hath Eternal Life, and I
will raise him up at the Last Day; For my
Flesh is Meat indeed, and my Blood is Drink
indeed. He that eateth my Flesh and drinketh
my Blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. As
the Living Father hath sent me, and I live by
the Father, so he that eateth me, even he shall
live by me. This is that Bread which came
down from Heaven; not as your Fathers did
eat Manna, &amp; are dead: He that eateth of this
Bread shall live forever, <hi>John</hi> 6. 32, 33, 34,

            <p>Q. What ought a <hi>Christian</hi> to seek after in
the first Place?</p>
            <p>A. Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and
his Righteousness, and all these Things shall be
added unto you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33.</p>
            <p>Q. How ought <hi>Christians</hi> to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in this World?</p>

               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:43450:54"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> But this I say, Brethren, the Time is

Wives be as though they had none; and they
that weep, as though they wept not; and they
that rejoyce, as though they rejoyced not;
and they that buy, as though they possessed
not; and they that use this World, as not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing
it; for the Fashion of this World pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

            <p>Q. What saith the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> further, as
that which is fit for <hi>Christian</hi> Men and Women
to be found in?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I will therefore, that Men pray every
where, lifting up holy Hands with out Wrath

adorn themselves in modest Apparel, with

            <p>Q. I observe, the Apostle is much against
the Vanity and Superfluity of Cloathes among

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Whose Adorning, let it not be that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Adorning of plating the Hair, of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

that which is not corruptible; even, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament

of a meek, quiet Spirit, which is in the

               <hi>Q.</hi> The Apostle is very plain there; but what
saith the Scripture, as to Respect of Persons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<hi>Christians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. My Brethren, have not the Faith of our
Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of Glory, with
Respect of persons: for if there come unto
your Assembly a Man with a Gold Ring in
goodly Apparel; and there come in also a
poor Man in vile Rayment; but ye have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to him that weareth the gay Clothing,
and say unto him, sit thou here in a good Place;
and say to the poor, stand thou there, or sit
here under my Foot-stool: Are you not then
partial in your selves, and are become Judges
of evil Thoughts? hearken my beloved Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
hath not God chosen the poor of this
World, rich in Faith, and Heirs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
which he hath promised to them that
love him; but ye have despised the poor. Do
not rich Men oppress you, and draw you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Judgment-Seat? Do they not blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
that worthy Name by the which ye are
called? If ye fulfil the royal Law according to
the Scripture, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour
as thy self, ye do well; but if we have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to Persons, ye commit Sin, and are
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43450:55"/>
convinced of the Law as Transgressors, <hi>Jam.</hi>
2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Though that be indeed sufficient to reprove
the different Rancks among <hi>Christians</hi> upon the
Account of Riches or Birth; yet is there not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Respect among <hi>Christians,</hi> as betwixt
Master and Servant: what Admonitions gives
the Apostle in this Case?</p>
            <p>A. Servants be obedient to them that are
your Masters, according to the Flesh, with
Fear and Trembling, in Singleness of your
Heart, as unto Christ, not with Eye-Service,
as Men Pleasers; but as the Servants of Christ,
doing the Will of God from the Heart; with
Good will doing Service, as to the Lord, and
not to Men; knowing that whatsoever good
Thing any Man doth, the same shall he receive
of the Lord, whether, he be bond or free And
ye Masters, do the same Things unto them,
forbearing Threatning, knowing that your
Master also is in Heaven; neither is there
Respect of Persons with him, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 5, 6,
7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Servants, obey in all things your Masters,
according to the Flesh; not with Eye Service,
as Men-Pleasers, but in Singleness of Heart,
fearing God: And whatsoever ye do, do it
heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto Men,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43450:56"/>
knowing, that of the Lord ye shall receive the
Reward of the Inheritance; for ye serve the
Lord Christ: But he that doth Wrong shall
receive for the Wrong which he hath done;
and there is no Respect of Persons, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.
22, 23, 24, 25.</p>
            <p>Masters, give unto your Servants that which
is just and equal, knowing that ye also have a
Master in Heaven, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
            <p>Let as many Servants as are under the Yoak
count their own Masters worthy of all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that the Name of God and his Doctrine
be not blasphemed: And they that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Masters, let them not despise them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are Brethren; but rather do them
Service, because they are faithful and beloved,
Partakers of the Benefit; these Things teach
and exhort, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Exhort Servants to be obedient unto their
own Masters, and to please them well in all
Things; not answering again, not purloining;
but shewing all good Fidelity, that they may
adorn the Doctrine of God in all Things, <hi>Tit.</hi>
2. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>Servants, be subject to your Masters with

what Glory is it, if when ye be buffeted for
your Faults, ye shall take it patiently; but if
when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it,
patiently, this is acceptable with God; for
even hereunto were ye called, because Christ
also suffered for us, leaving us an Example,

               <hi>Q.</hi> What good Admonitions gives the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as to the Relation betwixt Parents and
Children?</p>
            <p>A. Children, obey your Parents in the
Lord; for this is right: honour thy Father
and thy Mother (which is the first Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with Promise) that it may be well with
thee, and thou may'st live long on the Earth.
And ye Fathers, provoke not your Children
to Wrath; but bring them up in the Nurture
and Admonition of the Lord, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 1, 2,
3, 4.</p>
            <p>Children, obey your Parents in all Things;
for this is well-pleasing unto the Lord. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
provoke not your Children to Anger,
lest they be discouraged, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 20, 21.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What between Husbands and Wives?</p>
            <p>A. Wives, submit your selves unto your
own Husbands, as unto the Lord; for the
Husband is the Head of the Wife, even as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43450:57"/>
Christ is the Head of the Church, and he is the
Saviour of the Body: Therefore as the Church
is subject unto Christ; so let the Wives be to
their own Husbands in every thing. Husbands,
love your VVives; even as Christ loved the
Church, and gave himself for it, so ought men
to love their VVives as their own Bodies: he
that loveth his VVife, loveth himself; for this
Cause shall a Man leave his Father &amp; Mother,
and shall be joyned unto his VVife, aud they
two shall be one Flesh: Nevertheless, let every
one of you in particular so loye his Wife, even
as himself; and the Wife see that she reverence
her Husband, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 22, 23, 24, 25, 28, 31, 33.</p>
            <p>Husbands, love your VVives, and be not
bitter against them, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
            <p>Likewise ye VVives, be subject to your
own Husbands, that if any obey not the word,
they also may without the word be won by the
Conversation of the Wives, while they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
your Chast Conversation coupled with
Fear. Likewise, ye Husbands, dwell with
them according to Knowledge, giving Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
unto the VVife, as unto the weaker Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
and as being Heirs together of the Grace
of Life, that your Prayers be not hindred, 1
<hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What is the Armour of a true <hi>Christian?</hi>
and wherewith ought he to wrestle?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:43450:57"/>
A. Put on the whole Armour of God, that
ye may be able to stand against the Wiles of
the Devil; for we wrestle not against Flesh
and Blood, but against Principalities, against
Powers, against the Rulers of the Darkness
of this World, against spiritual VVickedness
in high Places; wherefore take unto you the
whole Armour of God, that ye may be able
to withstand in the evil Day, and having done
all, to stand. Stand therefore, having your
Loins girt about with Truth, and having on
the Breast-plate of Righteousness, and your
Feet shod with the Preparation of the Gospel
of Peace; above all, taking the Shield of
Faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench
all the fiery Darts of the Wicked One; and
take the Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword
of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, <hi>Ephes.</hi>

               <hi>Q.</hi> What are <hi>Christians</hi> Weapons? and for
what End?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> For though we walk in the Flesh, we do
not war after the Flesh; for the VVeapons of
our VVarfare are not carnal, but mighty
through God, to the pulling down of strong
Holds, casting down Imaginations and every
high Thing, that exalteth it self against the
Knowledge of God; and bringing into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity

            <p>A. VVho is a wise Man, and endued with
Knowledge amongst you? Let him shew out
of a good Conversation his Works with Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of VVisdom: but if ye have bitter En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
and Strife in your Hearts, glory not,
and lye not against the Truth: This VVisdom
descendeth not from above; but is Earthly,
Sensual, Devilish; for where Envying and
Strife is, there is Confusion and every evil
VVork: but the VVisdom that is from above
is first pure, then peaceable and easie to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
full of Mercy and good Fruits, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Partiality and without Hypocrisie: And
the Fruit of Righteousness is sown in Peace of
them that make Peace, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Ought Wars to be among <hi>Christians?</hi> from
whence proceed they?</p>
            <p>A. From whence come Wars &amp; Fightings
among you? Come they not hence, even from
your Lusts, that war in your Members: Ye lust,
and have not; ye kill and desire to have, and
cannot obtain; ye fight and war, yet ye have
not, because ye ask not, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 1, 2.</p>

Q. What saith Christ, even of Defensive
War?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> But I say unto you, that ye resist not
Evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on thy
right Cheek, turn to him the other also, <hi>Mat.</hi>
5. 39.</p>
            <p>But I say unto you which hear, Love your
Enemies; do Good to them which hate you;
bless them that curse you, and pray for them
which despightfully use you; and unto him
that smiteth thee on the one Check, offer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the other; and him that taketh away thy
Cloak, forbid not to take thy Coat also, <hi>Luke</hi>
6. 27, 28, 29.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What say the Apostles?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Recompense to no man Evil for Evil,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 17.</p>
            <p>Not rendring Evil for Evil, or Railing for

Man; but ever follow that which is Good, both

5. 15.</p>
            <p>Q. It was lawful of old to Swear; and an
Oath for Confirmation was to them an End of
all Strife: Is it not Lawful for <hi>Christians</hi> also
to Swear?</p>
            <p>

               <hi>A.</hi> Again, ye have heard, that it hath been
said by them of old time, Thou shalt not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swear
thy self; but shalt perform unto the
Lord thine Oathes: But I say unto you, Swear
not at all, neither by Heaven, for it is God's
Throne; nor by the Earth, for it is his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stool;
neither by <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> for it is the City

            <p>But above all things, my Brethren, swear not,
neither by Heaven, neither by the Earth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by any other Oath; but let your Yea be

               <hi>Q.</hi> Is it fit for <hi>Christians</hi> or Believers to
receive Carnal and Worldly Honour one from

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> How can ye believe which receive Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

               <hi>Q.</hi> Doth God allow us to give flattering Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
to Men?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Let me not, I pray you, accept any
Man's Person: neither let me give flattering
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43450:59"/>
Titles unto Man; for I know not to give flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Titles, in so doing my Maker would
soon take me away, <hi>Job</hi> 32, 21, 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What should we say to such as quarrel
us for speaking proper sound Words, as <hi>Thou</hi> to
One, <hi>You</hi> to Many; which is Christ's and the
Saints Language in the Scripture?</p>
            <p>A. If any man teach otherwise, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
not to wholesom Words, even the Words
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the Doctrine
which is according to Godliness, he is proud;
knowing nothing, but doting about Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Strife of Words, whereof cometh
Envy, Strife, Railings, Evil Surmisings, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
6. 3, 4.</p>

            <p>A. A new Commandment I give unto you,
that ye love one another, as I have loved you,
that ye also love one another: by this shall all

Love to one another. This is my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

<hi>Luke</hi> 12. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> What Advantage is to them that suffer
Persecution cheerfully, and Hazard to them that
shun it?</p>
            <p>A. Blessed are they which are persecuted
for Righteousness sake; for theirs is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
            <p>But if ye suffer for Righteousness sake,
happy are ye; and be not afraid of their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
neither be troubled, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
            <p>Whosoever therefore shall confess me before
Men, him will I confess also before my Father
which is in Heaven; but whosoever shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:43450:61"/>
me before Men, him will I also deny before
my Father which is in Heaven: He that loveth
Father or Mother more then me, is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of me; and he that taketh not his Cross,
and followeth after me, is not worthy of me:
He that findeth his Life shall loose it; and he
that looseth his Life for my sake shall find it,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 32, 33, 37, 38, 39.</p>
            <p>Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
me before Men, him shall the Son of Man
also confess before the Angels of God; but
he that denys me before Men, shall be deny'd
before the Angels of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>Then said Jesus unto his Disciples, If any
Man will come after me, let him deny himself,
and take up his Cross, and follow me; for
whosoever will save his Life shall loose it, and
whosoever will loose his Life for my sake shall
find it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24, 25.</p>
            <p>If we suffer, we shall also reign with him;
if we deny him, he also will deny us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
2. 12.</p>
            <p>If any come to me, and hate not his Father
and Mother, and Wife and Children, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
and Sisters; yea, and his own Life, he
cannot be my Disciple, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>And he said to them all, If any Man will
come after me, let him deny himself, and
take up his Cross daily, and follow me; for
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43450:62"/>
whosoever will save his Life shall loose it; but
whosoever will loose his Life for my sake, the
same shall save it, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 23, 24.</p>
            <p>And when he had called the People to him,
with his Disciples also, he said unto them, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
will come after me, let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
&amp; take up his Cross, &amp; follow me; for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
will save his Life shall loose it; but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall loose his Life for my sake and the
Gospel, the same shall save it, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 34, 35.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> There is nothing more certain, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to these Scriptures, then that <hi>Christians</hi>
must suffer Persecution in this World, even in
their Persons and Estates: But shall they not
also suffer in their Good Names, in being accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Blasphemers, Hereticks and Deceivers?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Disciple is not above his Master,
nor the Servant above his Lord; It is enough
for the Disciple that he be as his Master, and
the Servant, as his Lord: If they have called
the Master of the House <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elzebub,</hi> how much
more shall they call them of his Houshold?
<hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 24, 25.</p>
            <p>Blessed are ye when Men shall revile you,
and Persecute you, and shall say all manner of
Evil against you falsly for my sake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 11.</p>
            <p>Then they suborned men, which said, We
have heard him speak Blasphemous Words
against <hi>Moses</hi> and against God: And they
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43450:62"/>
stirred up the People, and the Elders, and the
Scribes, and came upon him and caught him,
and brought him to the Council, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 11,
12.</p>
            <p>And when they found them not, they drew
<hi>Jason</hi> and certain Brethren unto the Rulers of
the City, crying, These that have turn'd the
World upside down, are come hither also,
<hi>Acts</hi> 17. 6.</p>
            <p>But this I confess unto thee, that after the
Way which they call Heresie, so worship I
the God of my Fathers, believing all things
which are written in the Law and the Prophets,
<hi>Acts</hi> 24. 14.</p>
            <p>Being defamed, we entreat: we are made
as the Filth of the World, and are the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scouring
of all things unto this Day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
4. 13.</p>
            <p>By Honour and Dishonour, by Evil Report
and Good Report, as Deceivers, and yet true,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 8.</p>
            <p>Q. It is easily apparent from what is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
that <hi>Christians</hi> are to expect Persecution
and Tribulation; and that they are always the
Sheep, and never the Wolves; the Persecuted,
and never the Persecutors; the Afflicted, and
not the Afflicters; the Reproached, and not the
Reproachers: Is it not fit then that <hi>Christians</hi>
be so far from persecuting others, that they
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43450:63"/>
ought to pray for the Persecutors? is this Christ's
Command?</p>
            <p>A. But I say unto you, Love your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
Bless them that Curse you, do Good to
them that hate you, &amp; Pray for them which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spightfully
use you &amp; persecute you, <hi>Ma.</hi> 5. 44.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Was this Christ's own Practice?</p>
            <p>A. Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for
they know not what they do, &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 24.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is Christ herein to be our Example?</p>
            <p>A. For even hereunto were ye called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an
Example, that ye should follow his Steps,
who did no Sin, neither was Guise found in
his Mouth; who when he was reviled, reviled
not again; when he suffer'd, he threatned not,
but committed himself unto him that judgeth
righteously, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21, 22, 23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Is there an Instance of any Saint in
Scripture, who follow'd his Example herein?</p>
            <p>A. And he kneeled down, and cryed with
a loud Voice, Lord; Lay not this Sin to their
Charge, <hi>&amp;c. Acts</hi> 7. 60.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> It appears by all these Scriptures, that
<hi>Christianity</hi> consisteth in the Exercise of Fear
and Trembling, Humility, Patience and Self-Denyal;
What ought we then to think of such
who place much of their Religion in abstaining
from Marriage, and certain Meats; Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

of Angels, and other such Acts of voluntary
Humility?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Now the Spirit speaketh expresly, That
in the latter Times some shall depart from the
Faith, giving heed to Seducing Spirits and
Doctrines of Devils, speaking Lyes in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie;

of them which believe and know the

               <hi>Question.</hi> VVHat is the Duty of a
Magistrate?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The God of <hi>Israel</hi> said, the Rock of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:43450:64"/>
               <hi>Israel</hi> spake to me; he that Ruleth over men
must be Just, Ruling in the Fear of God,
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 3.</p>
            <p>Q. What do the Scriptures speak of the
Duty of such as are under Authority?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Let every Soul be subject to the Higher
Powers; for there is no Power but of God:
the Powers that be, are ordained of God;
Whosoever therefore resists the Power, resists
the Ordinance of God; &amp; they that resist shall
receive to themselves Damnation: For Rulers
are not a Terror to Good Works, but to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.
Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power,
Do that which is Good, and thou shalt have
Praise of the same; for he is the Minister of
God to thee for Good: But, if thou do that
which is Evil, be afraid; for he beareth not
the Sword in vain; for he is the Minister of
God; a Revenger, to execute Wrath upon him
that doth Evil. Wherefore ye must needs be
subject, not only for Wrath, but also for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
sake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Submit your selves to every Ordinance of
Man for the Lord's sake, whether it be to the
King, as Supream; or unto Governours, as
unto them that are sent by him, for the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Evil-Doers, and for the Praise of
them that do well; for so is the Will of God,

the Ignorance of Foolish Men, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.

               <hi>A.</hi> For, for this Cause pay we Tribute al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so;
for they are God's Ministers, attending

Tribute is due, Custom to whom Custom,

22. 21.</p>
            <p>Q. Are we obliged to obey Magistrates in
such things, as we are perswaded in our Minds

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> And they called them, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them not to speak at all, nor teach in the

and said unto them, Whether it be right in

then unto God, judge ye; for we cannot but
speak the things which we have seen &amp; heard,
<hi>Acts</hi> 4. 18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>And when they had brought them, they set
them before the Council, and the High-Priest
asked them, saying, Did not we straightly
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:43450:65"/>
command you, that ye should not teach in
this Name? And behold, ye have filled <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi>
with your Doctrine, and intend to bring
this Man's Blood upon us: Then <hi>Peter</hi> and the
other Apostles answer'd, and said, We ought to

            <p>A. Then stood there up one in the Council,
a <hi>Pharisee,</hi> named <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> a Doctor of Law,
had in Reputation among the People, and
commanded to put the Apostles forth a little
space, and said unto them, Ye men of <hi>Israel,</hi>
take heed to your selves what ye intend to
do as touching these men: And now I say
unto you, Refrain from these men, and let
them alone; for if this Counsel or this Work
be of men, it will come to nought; but if it
be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, lest hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily

whom the Godly must not take upon them to

but leave it to God, to do it by his Angels?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Field is the World; the good Seed

Tares are the Children of the Wicked One<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Enemy that sowed them is the Devil; the
Harvest is the End of the World; and the
Reapers are the Angels: As therefore the
Tares are gathered and burnt in the Fire, so

they shall gather out of his Kingdom all things
that offend, and them which do Iniquity, <hi>Mat.</hi>

How the Dead are raised? and with what
Body?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Thou Fool, that which thou sowest is
not quickned except it dye: and that which
thou sowest, thou sowest not that Body that
shall be; but bare Grain, it may chance of
VVheat, or some other Grain: But God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
it a Body as it hath pleased him, and to
every Seed his own Body. All Flesh is not the
same Flesh; but there is one kind of Flesh of
Men, another Flesh of Beasts, another of Fishes
and another of Birds: there are also Celestial
Bodies, and Bodies Terrestrial; but the Glory
of the Celestial is one, and the Glory of the
Terrestrial is another: there is one Glory of
the Sun, and another Glory of the Moon, and
another Glory of the Stars; for one Star differs
from another Star in Glory; so also is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the Dead; it is sown in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
it is raised in Incorruption; it is sown
in Dishonour, it is raised in Glory; it is sown
in VVeakness, it is raised in Power; it is sown
a Natural Body, it is raised a Spiritual Body:
There is a Natural Body, and there is a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42,

            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> The Apostle seems to be very positive,
that it is not that Natural Body, which we

neither doth Corruption inherit Incorruption.

Trump (for the Trumpet shall sound) and the
Dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we
shall be changed: For, this Corruptible must

               <p>A Short Introduction to the Confession of
FAITH.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>HAving thus largely and evidently perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the chief Part of that which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
in this Treatise, in giving a full Account
of our Principles in plain Scripture-words; and
also answering by the Scriptures the chief and
main Objections made against us, I come to a
<hi>Confession of Faith,</hi> in which I shall not be so
large, for that I judge it not convenient to make
an Inter-repetition of all the Scriptures before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
which, if needful, the Reader may
easily observe were not very difficult to do: But
whereas a <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> calleth rather for
an Affirmative Account of one's own Faith, then
for the Solution of Objections, or any thing of
Debate in a Discursive Way, which is both more
properly and pertinently performed in a <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism,</hi>
therefore I have here only done so. I
am necessitate sometimes to intermix some words
for coherence of the Matter, as sometimes (<hi>And</hi>)
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43450:68"/>
and sometimes (<hi>Therefore</hi>) and the like; but
not such as any ingenous Person can affirm, do
add to the Matter, or that may any wise justly
be reckon'd a Comment or Meaning, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to avoid the Censure of the most Curious
Carping Critieks; these are marked with a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Character. Likewise, unless I should
have ridiculously offered to publish incongruous
Grammar, there was a true Need sometimes to
change the Mood and Person of a Verb; in all
which places, whosoever will look to the words,
shall find it is done upon no Design to alter any
whit the naked import of them: as for instance;
where Christ sayes, <hi>I am the Light of the
World;</hi> were it proper for me to write thus, <hi>I am
the Light, &amp;c?</hi> Or can it be reckoned any whit
contradicting of my Purpose or Promise to
write, <hi>Christ is the Light,</hi> where the first Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is changed to the third? Also, sometimes I
express things which are necessarily understood,
as when any of the Apostles say <hi>We,</hi> there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of <hi>We,</hi> I write <hi>Apostles;</hi> and where they
say <hi>You,</hi> speaking to the Saints, there I mention
<hi>Saints</hi> instead of it for the Connexion of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
sometimes requires it; as in the first Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
in mentioning that of 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 5. concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

            <argument>
               <p>A Short Expostulation with, and Appeal
to all other Professors.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>COme, let us reason with you, all ye Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of <hi>Christianity,</hi> of what sort or
kind soever; and bring forth your <hi>Catechisms</hi>
and <hi>Confessions of Faith</hi> to that which by most
of your selves is accounted the Touch-Stone
or Rule: And suffer your selves no more to be
blinded, and to Err through your Ignorance
of the Scriptures, and of the Power of God;
But freely acknowledg &amp; confess to that Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Gospel and Light, which the Scriptures
so clearly witness to, and your Experience
must needs answer; as also to these other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
which consequentially depend upon
the Belief of that Noble and truly <hi>Catholick</hi>
Principle, wherein the Love of God is so
mercifully exhibited to all men, and his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Mercy do like Twins so Harmonous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concord; his Mercy in the oft tendering of
his Love through the Strivings and Wreslings
of his Light, during the Day of every man's
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:43450:88"/>
Visitation; and his Justice, both in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
and cutting away of the Wicked Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Spirit in those that suffer themselves
to be redeemed through his Judgments; and
in the utter Overthrow of such, who rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
against the Light, and doing Despight to
the Spirit of Grace, hate to be reformed:
Now, not only this Fundamental Principle is
clearly held forth in this Treatise, but all these
that depend upon it, as the real and inward
Justification of the Saints, through the Power
and Life of Jesus revealed in them, their full
and Perfect Redemption from the Body of
Death and Sin, as they grow up by the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
and Prevalency of his Grace; and yet,
lest Security should enter, there is great need
of Watchfulness, in that they may even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
after they have really witnessed a good
Condition, and make Ship-wrack of the Faith,
and of a good Conscience, with all the Parts
of the Doctrine of Christ, as they lie linck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together like a Golden Chain, which doth
very much evidence the Certainty and Vertue
of Truth above all Heresies, Error and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
however so cunningly gilded with the
specious Pretences thereof; for Truth is intire
in all its Parts, and consonant to it self, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the least Jar, having a wonderful Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and notable Harmony, answering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:43450:88"/>
like the Strings of a well-tuned Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
whereas the Principles of all other
Professors, though in some things most of
them come near, and divers acknowledge that
which is Truth; yet in most things they stray
from it, so that their Principles greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
&amp; jar one against another; and though
they may alledge Scriptures for some of their
Principles, yet they are put strangely to wrest
it, and to deny it for others. My <hi>Appeal</hi> then
to, and <hi>Expostulation</hi> with all sorts of profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
is not to prove some one or two Points
by the Scriptures (for there be some general
Notions of Truth, which most (if not all)
agree to) but the whole Body of our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
as they stand in relation to each other,
which none of them all is able to do; for,
among the many Professors, their <hi>Catechisms</hi>
and <hi>Confessions of Faith,</hi> I find none (save the
Dispensation of Truth now again revealed)
but such as in most of their substantial Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
differ greatly, and in many contradict
grosly the plain Text and Tenour of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
I confess there be certain men in this
Age, who with some plausible Appearance of
Reality undertake this Task: These are they
that joyn with, and own not wholely any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied
People; but while they pretend a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Love to all, yet find Fault with some part
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:43450:89"/>
of every sort, while in the mean time they
scarce can give any Account of their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and most of them prove at bottom to
have none at all: These men, I say, may
perhaps acknowledge some general Truths,
and also hold to the Letter of the Scripture
in some other things, so as thereby to take Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
largly to judge others, while themselves
offer not to bring these good things to practise
they blame others for the Want or Neglect
of: But such an Enterprize from these men
will not (when weighed) prove a fulfilling
of this Master, seeing it is not enongh to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
many Truths, but also to deny and
witness against all Error; and likewise, not to
fall short of any Truth, which ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged:
Whereas these sort of men for
the most part cannot give account of their
Faith in many things needful to be believed;
and whatever things they may acknowledge
to be true, they err most grievously, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
a Truth most needful to be minded and
answered, as is proved hereto, in that they
stand not forth to appear for any of these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries,
they pretend they have, but make
a shift to hide their Heads in Times of Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
so as not to suffer for, nor with any: And
through these fine Pretences above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
through their Scruples of joyning with
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:43450:89"/>
any, they can cunningly shun the Difficulties
of Persecutions, that attend the particular Sects
of <hi>Christians;</hi> and yet by their general Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Love to all, claim a Share in any Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
or Advantages that accrew to one and all:
Such then cannot honestly lay claim to justifie
their Principles and practices from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
But I leave these Straglers in Religion,
and come again to the divers Sects.</p>
            <p>To begin with these, that are most nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
I think I need not say much to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
in this Case; for they do not so much as
pretend to prove all their Dogmaes by the
Scriptures; sith it is one of their chief Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
That Tradition may Authorize Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
without any Authority of Scripture;
Yea, the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> hath made bold
to command things to be believed <hi>Non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stante
Scriptura,</hi> i.e. Though the Scriptures
say the contrary; and indeed, it were their
great Folly, to pretend to prove their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
by Scripture, seeing the <hi>Adoration of
Saints and Images, Purgatory, and Prayer for
the Dead, the Precedency of the Bishop of</hi> Rome,
<hi>the Matter of Indulgencies,</hi> with much more
Stuff of that kind; hath not the least Shadow
of Scripture for it.</p>
            <p>Among <hi>Protestants,</hi> I know the <hi>Socinians</hi>
are great Pretenders to the Scriptures, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:43450:90"/>
in Words as much exalt them as any other
People; And yet its strange to see how that
not only in many things they are not agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to them; but in some of their chief Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
quite contrary unto it, as in their Deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Divinity of Christ,</hi> which is as expresly
mentioned as any thing can be; <hi>And the Word
was God, Joh.</hi> 1. As also in Denying his Being
from the Beginning, against the very Tenour
of that of <hi>John</hi> 1. and divers other, as at large
is shown in the third Chapter of this Treati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e.
Divers other things, as to them, might be
mentioned; but this may suffice, to stop their
Boasting in this Matter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Arminians</hi> are not more successful in
their Denying the False Doctrine of <hi>Absolute
Reprobation,</hi> and in Asserting the <hi>Vniversal
Extent of Christ's Death for all,</hi> then they are
short in not placing this Salvation in that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Light, where with man is enlightned by
Christ; but wrongously asscribing a Part of
that to the Natural Will and Capacity, which
is due alone to the Grace and Power of God,
by which the Work is both begun, carried on
and accomplished. And herein they, as well
as both the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Pelagians,</hi> though
they do well in Condemning their Errors;
yet they miss, in setting up another, and not
the Truth in place thereof, and in that respect
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:43450:90"/>
are justly reproved by such Scriptures as their
Adversaries (who otherwise are as far wrong
as they) bring against them, in shewing the
Depravity of man's VVill by Nature, and his
Incapacity to do any Good, but as assisted by
the Grace of God so to do.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Its strange to observe
how many <hi>Protestants</hi> (the first Article of
whose <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> is, to assert the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to be the Only Rule</hi>) should deny the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
Extent of Christ's Death, contrary
to the express words of Scripture, which saith,
<hi>He tasted Death for for every man;</hi> or the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversality
of Grace, and a sufficient Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which the Scriptures assert in as many
positive words, as, except we may suppose
the Pen-men intended another thing then they
spoke, it was possible to do, viz. <hi>A Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of the Spirit is given to every man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
withal; The Grace of God, that brings Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
hath appeared unto all men;</hi> and many
more be ore-mentioned: The like may be
said of their denying the Perfection of the
Saints, and asserting the Impossibility of any
falling away from real Beginnings of true and
saving Grace, contrary to so many express
Scriptures, as are heretofore adduced in their
proper Place. But to give all that defire to
be undeceived a more full Oportunity to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:43450:91"/>
serve how the Devil has abused many, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to be wise, in making them cloak with
a Pretence of Scripture, false and pernicious
Doctrines; I shall take a few of many Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
out of the <hi>Confession of Faith</hi> and <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism,</hi>
made by the Divines at <hi>Westminster</hi> (so
called) because the same is not only most u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversally
received and believed by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> but also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
upon the Matter the Faith of the
<hi>French</hi> Churches, and of most others, both
in the <hi>Nether-Lands,</hi> and else-where, that
it may appear what wild Consequences these
Men have sought, both contrary to the naked
Import of the words, and to all common
Sense and Reason, to cover some of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
Principles.</p>

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to look over and examine them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I shall begin with the first Chapter Sect. 1.
where they assert two things: First,</hi> That
God has committed his Will now wholely to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> That the former Wayes of
God's revealing his Will, as by Immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:43450:92"/>
are now ceased. <hi>The Scriptures they
bring to prove, are first,</hi> Prov. 22. 19, 20, 21.
<hi>Vers.</hi> 19. That thy Trust may be in the Lord,
I have made known to thee this day, even to thee.
<hi>Vers.</hi> 20. Have not I written to thee Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Things in Counsels &amp; Knowledge. <hi>Vers.</hi> 21.
That I might make thee know the Certainty of
the Words of Truth, that thou mightest answer
the Words of Truth to them that send unto thee.
<hi>Luke 1. 3, 4. Vers.</hi> 3. It seemed good to me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
having had perfect Vnderstanding of all
things from the very first, to write unto thee in
Order, most excellent <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that thou
mightest know the Certainty of those things
wherein thou hast been instructed. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15 4.
For whatsoever things were written afore-time,
were written for our Learning, that we through
Patience and Comfort of the Scriptures might
have Hope. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 4, 7, 10. But he answered,
and said, It is written, Man shall not live by
Bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth
out of the Mouth of God. 7. Jesus said unto
him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt
the Lord thy God. 10. Then saith Jesus unto
him, Get thee hence, Satan; for it is written
Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him
only shalt thou serve. <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 19, 20. 19. And
when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:43450:92"/>
that have Familiar Spirits, and unto Wizards,
that peep and that mutter; Should not a People
seek unto their God? for the Living to the Dead?
To the Law and to the Testimony, if they speak
not according to this Word, it is because there is
no Light in them.</p>
            <p>But is it not matter of Admiration, that
men should be so beside themselve, as to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
these Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>timonie, do in the least prove
their Assertion; or that others, that do not
take things meerly upon Trust, would be so
foolish as to believe them: For, though God
made known and wrote excellent things to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon;</hi>
Though <hi>Luke</hi> wrote unto <hi>Theophilus</hi>
an Account of divers Transactions of Christ's
Outward Abode; <hi>For many were never writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi>
Joh. last vers. last; et 20. 30. <hi>And there
are also many other things which Jesus did, the
which if they should be written every one, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that even the World it self could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Books that should be written: And many
other Signs truly did Jesus in the Presence of his
Disciples, which are not written in this Book.</hi>
Though Christ made use of divers Scriptures
against Satan, and that <hi>Isaiah</hi> directed People
to the Law and to the Testimony, who will be
so mad as to say, <hi>It naturally follows from thence
that God has now committed his Will wholely to
Writing?</hi> Such a Consequence is no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:43450:93"/>
from these Scriptures, then if I should
argue thus, <hi>The Divines of</hi> Westminster <hi>have
asserted many things without Ground, therefore
they had Ground, for nothing they said:</hi> Nay, it
follows not by far so naturally, seeing after
the writing of all these Passages, by them ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
according to their own Judgment, there
were divers Scriptures written; so that it had
been false for them to assert, <hi>That G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d had then

                  </gap>iting,</hi> which
indeed was not true; So it is most Irrational
and Unwarrantable for any to draw such a
strange and strained Consequence from their
words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the</hi> Second, That the former Wayes are
now ceased, <hi>they alledge Hebr.</hi> 1. 1, 2. God,
who at sundry Times and in divers Manners,
spake in times past unto the Fathers by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
hath in these last dayes spoken unto us by
his Son, whom he hath appointed Heir of all
things, by whom also he hath made the World<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. We have also a More Sure Word
of Prophesie, whereunto ye do well that ye take
heed, as unto a Light that shineth in a Dark
Place,, until the Day dawn, and the Day-Star
arise in your Hearts.</p>
            <p>Which prove th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Matter as little as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
If <hi>Paul</hi> had intended by that to <hi>Timothy</hi>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:43450:93"/>
what those Divines would have, Would not
they have made the Apostle speak a manifest
Untruth, seeing they themselves acknowledg
that <hi>John</hi>'s Revelation was written long after;
so that these former Ways were not then ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
As for that of <hi>Peter,</hi> it is to beg the thing
in Question, To say, <hi>It is intended of the
Scripture;</hi> and though it were, it proves not
the Case at all. That of <hi>Hebr.</hi> is so ar from
asserting the Matter they would have it, that
it may be very aptly brought to prove the
quite contrary; for God indeed speaks to us
now by his Son: But to infer from thence,
<hi>That the Son speaks only to us by the Scriptures,</hi>
remains yet unproved; A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d for the Apostle
to have there asserted it, had been false; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Revelations,</hi> which he and others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
had, were inward, &amp; so such were not
ceased: And if we may trust the same Apostle
better then these Men, he tells us, that so soon
as Christ was revealed in him, he went straight
and obey'd: And the same Apostle tells us, that
<hi>Except Christ be in us, we are Reprobates;</hi>
sure he is not dumb in us, seeing he sayes, <hi>He
will dwell in us and walk in us, and be with us to
the End of the World.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> tells us, that
<hi>the inward Anointing is to teach us all things,</hi> so
that we need not, as to any absolute Necessity,
any Man to teach us; how then is this ceased,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:43450:94"/>
seeing God speaks to us by Christ, and Christ
must be in us? Surely, these Men have not
herein followed the Rule of the Scriptures;
but rather endeavoured most grosly to wrest
them, and make of them a Nose of Wax,
notwithstanding their Pretences as to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
in their 6th Sect. where they say, <hi>All
things necessary are either expresly set down, or
by good and necessary Consequences may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced:</hi>
Now that these two former Assertions
are not expresly set down, they will not deny;
whether they follow by sound Consequence,
any understanding Man may judge, by
what is above observed.</p>
            <p>There are divers other things in the same
Chapter, which will not abide the Test, for
which the Scripture-Proofs are alledged by
them, are most ridiculous; yet for Brevity's
sake I have omitted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Chap. 21. Sect. 7. where they say,</hi> That
the Sabbath from the Resurrection of Christ,
was changed into the First Day of the Week,
which in Scripture (<hi>say they</hi>) is called the
Lord's Day, and is to be continued to the End
of the World, as the <hi>Christian</hi>-Sabbath. <hi>In
which they assert Three Things:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, That the First Day of the Week is
come in place of the Seventh for a Sabbath:
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:43450:94"/>
               <hi>To prove which, they alledge</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 1, 2
Now concerning the Collection for the Saints, as
I have given order to the Churches of <hi>Galat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
even so do ye upon the First Day of the Week:
Let every one of you lay by him in store, as God
hath prospered him, that there be no Gathering
when I come. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. And upon the First
Day of the Week, when the Disciples came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to break Bread, <hi>Paul</hi> preached to them,
ready to depart on the morrow, and continued his
Speech until Midnight.</p>
            <p>That these Proofs assert not the thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
we need not, I suppose, dispute.
Now to say, that because <hi>Paul</hi> desired the
<hi>Corinthians</hi> to lay somewhat by them in
store that day; or because he broak Bread, and
continued his Speech until Midnight; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the First Day of the Week is come in
place of the Sabbath, is a Consequence more
remarkable for its Sottishness, then to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited
for its Soundness: Indeed to make so
solemn an Article of Faith, as these men would
have the Morality of the first day of the Week
to be, would need a more positive and express
Authority. The Text doth clearly enough
tell the Reason of the Disciples meeting so
frequently, and of <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching so long,
because he was ready to depart to morrow; it
speaks not a word of its being Sabbath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:43450:95"/>
Their <hi>Second</hi> Assertion, <hi>That the First Day
of the Week is therefore called the Lord's Day,</hi>
is drawn yet more strangly from that of <hi>Rev.</hi>
1. 10. <hi>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day,
and heard behind me a great Voice, as of a
Trumpet;</hi> Whereas no particular Day of the
Week is mentioned: so for them to say,
<hi>John meaned the First Day of the Week,</hi> hath
no more Proof but their own bare Assertion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For their</hi> Third <hi>Assertion,</hi> That it is to be
continued to the End of the World, as the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>-Sabbath,
<hi>they alledge these Scriptures,
Exod.</hi> 20. 8, 10, 11. Remember the Sabbath-Day,
to keep it Holy; but the Seventh Day is
the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt
not do any Work, thou, nor thy Son, nor thy
Daughter, thy Man-Servant, nor thy Maid-Servant,
nor thy Cattel, nor thy Stranger,
which is within thy Gates; for in Six Dayes
the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea,
and all that in them is, and rested the Seventh
Day; wherefore the Lord bless<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d the Sabbath
Day, and hallowed it. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 56. 2, 4, 6, 7.
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 17, 18. Think not that I am come to
destroy the Law or the Prophets; I am not come
to destroy, but to fulfil: For verily, I say unto
you, Till Heaven and Earth pass, one J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t or one
Tittle shall in no wise pass from the Law, till all
be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:43450:95"/>
If they prove any thing, they must needs
prove the Continuance of the Seventh Day,
seeing in all the Law there is no mention made
of the First Day of the Week being a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath:
If these may be reckoned good and
sound Consequences, I know no Absurdities
so great, no Heresies so damnable, no Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions
so ridiculous, but may be cloaked with
the Authority of Scripture.</p>
            <p>In their 27th Chapter, in the 1, 2, 3. Sections,
they speak at large of the Definition and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Sacraments;</hi> but in all the Scriptures
they bring, there is not one word of <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
The Truth is, there was a good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for this Emission; for such a thing is not
to be found in all the Bible. For them to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that the thing signified is (though that
be also a begging of the Question) will not
excuse such, who else-where aver <hi>the whole
Counsel of God is contained in the Scripture,</hi>
to forsake and reject the Tenour thereof, and
scrape out of the Rubbish of the <hi>Romish Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
for that which is reckoned by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
so substantial a Part of their Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In their 4th Section they assert two things:
First,</hi> That there are Two only Sacraments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gospel. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That these two are
Baptism and the Supper.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:43450:96"/>
               <hi>To prove which they alledge</hi> Mat. 28.
19. Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations,
Baptizing them in the Name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20, 23. When ye come together
therefore into one place, this is not to eat
the Lord's Supper; for I have received
of the Lord that which also I delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, that the Lord Jesus the same Night
in which he was betrayed, took Bread. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
4. 1. Let a man so account of us, as of the
Ministers of Christ, and Stewards of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of God. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5. 4. And no man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
this Honour to himself, but he that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
of God, as was <hi>Aaron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now granting there were such a thing, as
<hi>Sacraments,</hi> to be so solemnly performed; all
that these Scriptures will prove is, <hi>That these
two were appointed to be performed:</hi> but that
there are only two, or that these are they
(which is the thing asserted, and incumbent to
be proved) there is not the least Shadow of
Proof alledged; for, according to their own
Definition of a <hi>Sacrament</hi> in the larger <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism,</hi>
where they say, <hi>The Parts of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are Two; the one an outward and sensible
Sign, used according to Christ's own Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the other, an inward and spiritual Grace
thereby signified;</hi> both the <hi>Washing of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:43450:96"/>
Feet,</hi> and the <hi>Anointing of the Sick with
Oyl</hi> doth Answer to it, and many other
Things: So that the Probation of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at all, or of their being Two, Seven,
yea, or Seventy, is all alike easie, seeing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Name nor Number is to be found in the
Scripture, they being the meer Conceits and
Inventions of men; and yet it is marvellous
to see with how great Confidence some men
do assert the Scripture to be their Rule, while
they build up so considerable Parts of their
Doctrine, without the least Scripture-Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Thus I thought fit to pitch upon these three,
viz. the <hi>Scriptures, Sabbaths</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi>
because these be three of the main things for
which we the <hi>Quakers</hi> are chiefly cry'd out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
and accused, as believing Erroneously
concerning them: Now what we believe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
these things, and how agreeable our Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
herein is to the Scriptures, is heretofore
sufficiently demonstrated: Also, how little
Scripture-Proof these have for their contrary
Assertions to us in these things, notwithstanding
of their great Pretences to Scripture, will also
appear to the Vnbyassed Reader.</p>
