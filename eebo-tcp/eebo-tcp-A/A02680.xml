            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of ſome kinde of men, that they profite, but ſtill to the worſe, 2. <hi>Tim. 3.</hi> It is not long ſince that there was a Booke ſet forth, admoniſhing the Friars to be ſober, but they have burnt ſo many of thoſe Bookes, and read ſo few of them, as from folly they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited to extreame madneſſe. It was little ſobriety to excommunicate one man, for the fault, or no fault of another. But howſoever <hi>clave errante, vel non errante,</hi> the <hi>Cenſures</hi> are Epiſcopall. But for a Prelat to throw away his Keyes, &amp; to take the Sword, &amp; to hang it at a Friars belt, &amp; with it to play the Fencer, yea the Offender.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Italian</hi> ſayes, That before a man falls into any great calamity, God firſt gives him a rappe upon the pate, that is, hee deprives him of his judgment, well expreſſed by the Poet, <hi>De Ponto lib.</hi> 4.</p>

            </lg>
            <p>A wretched man, right, reaſon firſt forſakes,</p>
            <p>He reckes not of advice, nor counſell takes.</p>
            <p>The Friars began with <hi>Excom.</hi> they arrived at <hi>Exile.</hi> What's the next? <hi>Aſsiſes and Quarter-Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW this ſame <hi>Paul Harris</hi> is doubtleſſe the Engliſh Prieſt, who lives in <hi>Dublin,</hi> who wrote a Booke in anſwer to <hi>Tho.

So then it ſeemes this ſame <hi>Paul Harris</hi> the Engliſh Prieſt, is to be commanded by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Meath</hi> Do. <hi>Deſe,</hi> authorized by the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Cardinalls <hi>De propagandâ fide,</hi> to depart the Dioceſſe of <hi>Dublin.</hi> Certs if the Biſhop of <hi>Meath</hi> his Warrant come in the Name of King CHARLES, it will doubtleſſe bee obeyed; but if it come in any other mans name, <hi>Paul Harris</hi> (as farre as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his minde) is reſolved not to depart. Nay, if all the Friars, Prieſts, Biſhops, Cardinalls, Popes, and a generall Councell, ſhall command him to depart, he will not remove a foot out of the Dioceſſe of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin.</hi> The reaſons of this his reſolution he hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly yeelded, and publiſhed unto the world, in an Anſwer unto the Archbiſhops <hi>Excom.</hi> cap. 3. Yea, but it is ſaid in the text of this Letter, That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Meath</hi> is to command him <hi>Forthwith to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</hi> Alas good Friars, give him leave to pay his way, and bid his friends farewell. <hi>Forthwith</hi> is very ſudden. Let him at leaſt depart with bag &amp; baggage,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19638:5"/>as Souldiours doe from the Fort they can no longer defend. Happily <hi>Paul Harris</hi> cannot ſay as old <hi>Bias</hi> did, <hi>Omniamea mecumporto.</hi> The Friars ſay, hee is rich: Will they not allow him time to tranſport his wealth to the place of his future reſidence, to make ſale of his houſes, and lands, and to recover the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reeres of his rents, to call in his debts, to make an end of his ſuites in law, &amp;c. All which require time, and cannot be diſpatched <hi>Forthwith. Patrick Cahil</hi> being baniſhed the ſame Dioceſſe by the preſent Archb. was allowed 15. dayes of abode before he removed. O but he was a native, and <hi>Harris</hi> is an Engliſh churle, and muſt not be ſo kindly dealt withall. <hi>Forthwith:</hi> This is like the Summons of Gads hill, or Salesbury plaine, <hi>Stand &amp; deliver.</hi> Well, <hi>perambulet mare &amp; ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, quaerens quid devoret.</hi> Let the Friar compaſſe ſea and land, ſeeking what he may devoure, yet old <hi>Paul</hi> is reſolved to live among his old neighbours of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin,</hi> notwithſtanding the Friars ſhould determine the contrary in a generall Chapter.</p>
            <p>By this then gentle Reader, you ſee (at leaſt if this Letter came from <hi>Rome,</hi> as our Archb. pretends, and would have it to be beleeved) That the ſword of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile is taken out of his fiſt, and put into the Lord Biſh. of <hi>Meath</hi> his hands; who for all the perſwaſions that our Biſh. <hi>Flemming</hi> can uſe (ſee the luck of it) abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely denyes to draw out the ſame; In plaine termes that he never intends to pronounce any ſentence of exile againſt <hi>Harris,</hi> and ſo hath declared himſelfe to the face of our Archb, and his Friars, and to as many as deale with him about it. But how will the Biſh. of <hi>Meath</hi> anſwer this neglect, or rather contempt of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19638:5"/>
               <hi>Romane</hi> command? O! let it alone: He knowes how to give ſatiſfaction unto the holy Congregation of Cardinalls <hi>De propagandâ fide,</hi> or to any other miſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and abuſed ſuperiour. And now it pittyes me to ſee, (and yet I cannot but laugh) how our Archb. <hi>Plemming,</hi> and his Friars, torment themſelves in this buſineſſe. For now that they cannot induce the B. of <hi>Meath</hi> by no perſwaſion to this horride fact, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſentence a Prieſt to exile, yet never called to his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and much leſſe convicted of any fault, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently innocent, (for ſo the Law preſumes <hi>Reg. 8</hi>) They now cry out; <hi>O frustra noſtri ſuſcepti labores! O malè impenſi ſumptus!</hi> O all our labour in vaine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken! O coſts caſt away! Albeit in truth, all their labours, coſts and charges, were no more then the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing of one Letter unto Friar <hi>Wadding,</hi> a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto their owne heart, reſident continually in the <hi>Citty,</hi> and preſt to negotiate all their cauſes, a man of that zeale &amp; earneſtneſſe in procuration, as he would well weene to obtaine a ſentence before a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, a condemnation before a conviction.</p>
            <q>Cordiger eſuriens in coelum juſſeris ibit.</q>
            <p>I tell you perdy: A hungry Friar, hungry of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, hungry of honour, hungry of vanity and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, &amp; to conſerve his declining reputation among his fellowes, what will he not doe? <hi>Ad ſtygias ſi juſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ibit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then our Archb. and his Friars, ſeeing all their proceedings againſt <hi>Paul Harris,</hi> come to no better a paſſe in the <hi>Roman</hi> Court. The Archb. diſarmed as a party, &amp; therefore partiall. The Biſhop of <hi>Meath</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly authorized to pronounce ſentence, and refuſing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19638:6"/>that ſervice. I ſay, all deſignments &amp; machinations ſo untowardly ſucceeding on our Archb. ſide. At laſt, as deſperat of all better ſucceſſe, he betakes himſelfe to this ſilly refuge, forſooth to publiſh a privat Letter received fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Card. the Popes Nephew, which Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is nothing elſe in the world, but the caſe or cover of the Letter ſent unto the B. of <hi>Meath:</hi> As if one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft of his ſword, ſhould lay about him with the ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd. For it plainely appeares, that the B. of <hi>Meâth</hi> hath the ſword, and our B. nothing left him but the ſcabberd, with which he maketh this goodly flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, ſending abroad the coppyes thereof like ſo many butter-flyes among his followers and devoto's, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming (as he well may) of the many-headed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in all communityes as moſt injudicious, ſo with all moſt factious, being as ready as the blind Senator in <hi>Iuvenal, Sat. 4.</hi> to applaud what they heare others to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne: adding of his own invention, as likewiſe his Friars in their perambulations, that the ſentence of <hi>Harris</hi> his exile, awarded by the Ordinary, is now ratified &amp; confirmed by the <hi>Popes</hi> ſentence, which is as farre from truth, as <hi>Rome</hi> is from <hi>Dublin</hi> Nothing ſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Hol. in theſe parts inſinuating the ſame. And that now <hi>Harris</hi> (ſayth the Archb.) may turne the edge of his ſtile from me, upon the Cardinalls, who have confirmed my ſentence: And this he may doe with ſmal labour: for it is no more but to change the Title of his Booke fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me to them. So <hi>Tho. Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</hi> Al which (with due reſpect unto your place my Lord) are manifeſt untruths, and ſo convicted to bee by the tenure of this very Epiſtle of the Card. publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by your command into ſo many hands. For if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19638:6"/>that ſentence be put into the power of the B. of <hi>Meath</hi> to be pronounced <hi>de futuro,</hi> without relation to your ſentence at all. How then is your ſentence confirmed of which no mention is made? A ſentence of which it ſeemed your ſelfe being aſhamed, before a grave audience, did in expreſſe termes before many witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, diſclay me and deny ever to have given.</p>
            <p>For you may remember my Lo. Archb. that being called before the Lo. Biſhop of <hi>Derry,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Radcliffe</hi> Knight, there being then preſent Do. <hi>Peter Caddell,</hi> Do. <hi>Patrick Cahil, William Brown, Patrick Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, Edmund Doyle</hi> Prieſts, that you acknowledging and avowing your command of <hi>Peter Caddell</hi> out of your Dioceſſe, you conſtantly denyed the exile of <hi>Paul Harris,</hi> but onely that you willed and adviſed him to depart, by reaſon of which your deniall, hee was forced to produce his witneſſe <hi>William Browne</hi> Prieſt, who before thoſe two honorable perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charged by them upon his conſcience, as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man to ſpeake the truth, whether you onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired or commanded him to quitt your Dioceſſe; the ſaid <hi>William Browne</hi> did teſtifie, that you abſolutely commanded <hi>Paul Harris</hi> to depart, and to leave your Dioceſſe, and that himſelfe was the man who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo commanded to deliver that meſſage unto him in your name. All thoſe before named can witneſſe that buſineſſe ſo to have paſſed. And therefore I ſay, had your exile of <hi>Paul Harris</hi> been moſt legall, (which I will never grant) by your voluntary deniall thereof it was revoked, and utterly quaſhed, no leſſe then a ſentence of <hi>Excommunication, Suſpenſion,</hi> &amp;c. by the like deny all remaines cancelled and revoked. How
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19638:7"/>then now confirmed? It followeth.</p>
            <q>Otherwiſe to give order by authority of the ſame holy congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to the faithfull people, that none ſhall receive from him the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, nor heare his Maſſe.</q>
            <p>The order which <hi>Tho. Flemming</hi> gave foure yeeres agoe, was; That none under paine of Excom. ſhould be preſent at his Maſſe. The nullity of which Excom. being declared by an Anſwer thereunto, it was the leſſe obſerved, eſpecially of ſuch as were of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What order the B. of <hi>Meath</hi> was to lay down, appeareth not, for that the Serpent was cruſhed in the Egg.</p>
            <p>This ſacred Congregation of Card. <hi>De propagandâ fide,</hi> was inſtituted about the yeare 1612. by <hi>Paulus</hi> 5. of which Congregation at this time, Card. <hi>Antonio Barbarini,</hi> the youngeſt of the three nephewes of this preſent Pope <hi>Vrbanus 8.</hi> is head, or Praefect, a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 30. wiſe, but not much learned. And it is ſtrange that being wiſe, and an Italian (a Natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo reſpective) writing to forraigne countreyes, he would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Secretary, to ſtile his Epiſtles in Latin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe (peradventure) Latine is become a ſtranger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Latine Secretaryes. Wee <hi>Tramontani</hi> (as the Italians call us) directing our Letters unto the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither write them in Engliſh, or Iriſh, albeit we are not ignorant, that there wants not of theſe Countreyes in the Citty, who are able to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them into <hi>Italian.</hi> This Congregation of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalls (I confeſſe) have a glorious ſtile conferred upon them by his Hol. as to be Propagators, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19638:7"/>&amp; promoters of the Faith, but ſurely their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors will never anſwere unto thoſe honorable titles, ſo long as (giving eare to a company of turbulent &amp; male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content Friars) they ſhall ſeeke to diſturb the peace &amp; tranquillity of thoſe Kingdomes, over or in which they have no principality. I ſay, by exerciſing a ſecular pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over thoſe who are none of their ſubiects. For as his Majeſty of Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> never attempted to exile any of the Popes ſubjects out of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other his Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoryes; ſo neither ought they to baniſh any of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties liege people, either out of this, or that City, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or Dioceſſe, but to know their owne bounds, and not to tranſgreſſe the ſame. And truly were I either wiſe or learned, I would endeavour to perſwade thoſe moſt eminent L. Cardinalls (in acknowledgment of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror) either to ſend an Embafſadour unto his Majeſty, or at leaſt to direct a deprecatory Epiſtle unto him, by which he might be induced to paſſe over that injurious entrenchment upon his Crowne &amp; Dignity. And alas what leſſe can they doe? This truly would be a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable act, beſeeming their greatneſſe, and anſwerable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their high titles; by this meanes, the Faith might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be propagated, or certs leſſe ſcandalized. And it may be hoped, that in ſo generous a breſt of our renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Soveraigne, it would find both a gentle admittance and remittance.</p>
            <p>And as for the faithfull people here mentioned: Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as many as be of underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding &amp; capacity (who I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, are not the greateſt part of your flock) doe well ſee &amp; diſcerne, that all theſe machinations of the Friars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Harris,</hi> proceed meerely from malice, who for his deſire &amp; zeale of their reformation, as well in their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19638:8"/>manners in life, as abhominable errors in doctrine, doe labour by all meanes to ruinate &amp; undoe him. But <hi>P.H.</hi> is confident, that <hi>Qui habitat in adjutorio altiſsimi, in protectione Dei coeli commor abitur:</hi> Hee that dwells in the helpe of the higheſt, ſhall remaine in the protection of the God of Heaven. Neither is he better then his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, ſo many worthy Prelats and Prieſts, who for ſeeking to reforme abuſes among Monkes &amp; Friars, have ſuffered at their hands extreame perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not alwayes <hi>ad exiliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> but ſometimes <hi>ad ſanguine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Examples whereof both ancient and moderne, our Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtoryes doe recount. And it is no ſmal comfort unto <hi>P.H.</hi> and an affront to his adverſaryes, that his bookes being by the Friars preſented unto the <hi>Roman</hi> Cenſors, and by them read &amp; peruſed, tryed, ſifted &amp; bolted, yet came off as Gold from the fire, without the leaſt note, obeliske, or aſteris ke of reproofe, which is alſo no ſmall honour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our holy Faith, becauſe hereby thoſe who are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe perſwaded in matters of doctrine, may plainely ſee that the Catholique Church maintaines none of thoſe fooleryes, which the Friars <hi>profructu ventris</hi> doe daylie vent, and were largely confuted in his aforeſaid Booke. It followeth in the Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>And that ſome ſcandall ariſe not by meanes of this order, your Lordſhip may give unto the ſaid Biſhop, when he receiveth this encloſed, ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements &amp; informations, as you ſhall thinke fitting for prevention thereof.]</p>
            <p>But no advertiſements, or informations, that <hi>Dubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis</hi> could give, ſeemed ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to <hi>Medenſis</hi> to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of ſcandall, maturely conſidering, that it was a thing impoſſible, without notorious ſcandall, <hi>indictâ cauſâ</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:19638:8"/>to baniſh a Prieſt out of the Dioceſſe wherein hee hath his habitation, his friends, acquaintance, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, and that in a continued reſidence of more then 20. yeeres, and to be ſent into <hi>Pontus,</hi> I mean, to uncouth &amp; unknowne places, where being ſeparated from his friends &amp; wel-willers, he may with leſſe difficulty have his throat cut by a malicious Friar, or ſome ſuborned Wood-kerne. O! but <hi>Harris</hi> might paſſe into his native Countrey of <hi>England.</hi> True indeed, and ſo he may (but not for <hi>ſic volo, ſic jubeo</hi> of a Prelate) though as yet he is not ſo minded: theſe 20. yeeres of a continued abſence, having made him well-neere as much a ſtranger in his owne Countrey, as in the County of <hi>Tirconnell,</hi> where as yet he never ſet foot. Such are the fruites of time, whoſe nature is as the Poet <hi>Menander</hi> ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to procure oblivion. No no, with the good leave of the State, <hi>P.

            <p>Againe, the Lo. Biſhop of <hi>Meath</hi> no doubt doth well conſider, that a baniſhment inflicted without an exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the cauſe, without the bill of the Plaintiff, and anſwer of the Defendant, can not but be moſt injurious, &amp; illegall, and ſo by the ſame <hi>non-ſenſe</hi> of a <hi>nolo,</hi> that a party is removed from this Dioceſſe of <hi>Dublin,</hi> he may alſo be excluded from any other Dioceſſe, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently out of all Chriſtendome, for that there is no place in any Countrey of the Chriſtian world, but is contained in ſome Dioceſſe, and ſo perforce muſt bee
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19638:9"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to live either vpon the Seas, or among Turkes and Infidells.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the Lo. B of <hi>Meath</hi> had good cauſe to refuſe to be imployed in ſuch a piece of ſervice, <hi>viz.</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſentence of exile againſt any of the Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, for hee being a Do. of that famous Vniverſity of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> &amp; as by profeſſion a Divine, ſo alſo ſeene in the Canons &amp; Lawes of holy Church, doth well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that <hi>Exile</hi> is a puniſhment beyond the ſpheare of Epiſcopall juriſdiction, proper to the Crowne, and not to the Miter, and accordingly to be managed by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and not by the Spiritual arme. So S. <hi>Bernard</hi> in his 5. booke <hi>De conſideratione,</hi> unto Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> tells us; That as the Keyes belong unto the Prelats, ſo the Sword unto the Civill Magiſtrate. <hi>Forſitan tuo nutu, non tua ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu evaginandus:</hi> Peradventure by your will (ſayth he) not by your hand to be unſheathed. Which doctrine is layde downe, and canonized in the Decretals of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory lib. 5. de Cler. excom. tit. 27. cap. 2. Si quis presbyter, aut alius clericus fuerit degradatus, aut ab officio pro certis crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus ſuſpenſus, &amp; ipſe per contemptum &amp; ſuperbiam aliquid de miniſterio ſibi interdicto agere praeſumpſerit, &amp; poſtea ab E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopo ſuo correptus in incepta praeſumptione perduraverit modis omnibus excommunicetur, &amp; quicunque-cum co com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municaverit, ſimiliter ſe ſciat eſſe excommunicatum. Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter de Clericis, Laicis, vel foeminis excommunicatis obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dumeſt. Quod ſi aliquis omnia iſta contempſerit, &amp; Epiſcopus minimè emendare potuerit regis judicio ad requiſitionem Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae exilio damnetur:</hi> If a Prieſt or a Clergy-man ſhal be degraded, or for certaine crimes ſuſpended from his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and thorough contempt &amp; pride, ſhall preſume to doe any thing in his miniſtery forbidden unto him, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19638:9"/>after being by his Biſhop reproved, ſhall notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding perſevere in his former preſumption, by all meanes let him be excommunicated, and he who ſhall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with him, let him know that he is excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And this to be obſerved with Clerkes, Laicks, &amp; and women excommunicated. But if any ſhall contemne all theſe things, and that the Biſhop can put no remedy unto it, then by the judgment of the King, at the requeſt of the Church, let him be baniſhed.</p>
            <p>In which Canon is plainly diſtinguiſhed the office of the Biſhop, &amp; of the King. The ſpirituall cenſures of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. Suſpenſion &amp;c. to be inflicted by the Biſhop, &amp; not by the King. The temporall puniſhment of exile &amp;c. to be commanded by the King, and not by the Biſhop. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, in this Canon may be obſerved the order &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of a legall proceſſe; as firſt, conviction of crimes, or contumacy, including in his nature &amp; eſſence, a cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the party accuſed; next, infliction of ſpirituall cenſures by ſentence of the Biſhop, as Excom. Suſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp;c, which being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temned, &amp; the delinquent incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible. What then is to bee done? Mary the Biſhops power being exhauſted, in the laſt place comes in the ſword, to wit, corporall puniſhment of <hi>Exile,</hi> to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by the King, at the inſtance of the Church. By which it is manifeſt, that <hi>Exile</hi> is a puniſhment tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending all ſpirituall power &amp; Epiſcopall juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For elſe ſhould the Law have ſaid: Then by the judgment of the Biſhop, let him be baniſhed; but here it is ſaid <hi>in terminis,</hi> in expreſſe termes, by the judgment of the King let him be baniſhed.</p>
            <p>Like unto this is that other <hi>Canon de judiciis, lib. 2. tis. 1. cap. 10.</hi> In theſe words. <hi>Si Clericus in quocunque ordine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutus,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19638:10"/>in furto, vel homicidio, vel perjurio, ſeu alio crimine fuerit deprehenſus legitimè, atque convictus, ab Eccleſiaſtice judice deponendus est.

                  </gap>e poſsit eſse ultra perditio plurimorum, per ſecularem com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primendus est poteſtatem. Ita quod ei deputetur exilium, vel alia legitima poena inferatur.</hi> That is, If a Clergy man in what order ſoever, ſhalbe found in theft, or man-ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or perjury, or other crime, and being lawfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by the Eccleſiaſticall Iudge, he is to be depoſed; who, if after depoſition he ſhalbe incorrigible, he ought to be excommunicated, afterward his contumacy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, to be ſtroken with the ſword of <hi>Anathema:</hi> but if arriving at the depth of all evills, he ſhall remaine in contumacy, whenas the Church hath not further what to doe (that there be not beſides the deſtruction of very many) he is to be repreſſed by the Secular power. So as Exile may be deputed unto him, or ſome other lawfull puniſhment inflicted. So the Canon.</p>
            <p>In which we ſee, as in the former, that the power of the Church &amp; of the Prelat, proceedes no further, even with the greateſt delinquents, but to excommunication &amp; to <hi>Anathema,</hi> at which once arriving, they make a period, confeſſing (as we ſee in this <hi>Canon</hi>) that the Church can paſſe no further, but leaves Exile, &amp; all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corporall puniſhments, to the Secular power to be awarded &amp; inflicted. What then may we thinke of that Prelat, who not content with his ſpirituall ſword of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall cenſures, will with his owne hand unſheath the temporall ſword of the Civill Magiſtrate? which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19638:10"/>S. <hi>Bernard</hi> conformable unto the doctrin of the Church, lay de downe in theſe two Canons above cited, flatly denyeth not onely to Biſhops, but to the Pope himſelf, <hi>Non tuâ manuevaginundus:</hi> Not by thy hand (O Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi>) to be unſheathed. Yet hath our Archb. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto the Lawes of holy Church, &amp; the practiſe of all times, unſheathed the ſword of his Soveraigne and Liege Lord, once by his owne confeſſion, &amp; twice more by conviction of witneſſes, before honorable Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, by exiling out of his Dioceſſe, three Prieſts, albeit (I confeſſe) with very bad ſucceſſe, their diſobedience to unlawfull commands, being ſo juſtifiable as we have ſeene.</p>
            <p>I doe not marvaile then, though the B. of <hi>Meath</hi> like a good ſubject, did refuſe to meddle in a buſines of that nature, not having the conſent and approbation of the State. All temporall juriſdiction in inflicting corporall puniſhments, from the leaſt to the greateſt, being eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall unto his Majeſties Crowne &amp; Dignity. And I can not but wonder, that the Archb. <hi>Flemming</hi> &amp; his Friars, ſhould perſwade themſelves, that albeit a Prince be of another opinion in ſome points of doctrine, from the <hi>Roman,</hi> which wee call the Catholique &amp; Apoſtolicall Church, that therefore he is a leſſe abſolute and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Commander within his Realmes &amp; Dominions, over which Almighty GOD hath placed him, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other the moſt Catholique Prince in the World: which is a doctrine ſo undoubted, as it is defined by the Church, as a matter of divine faith, which whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth, <note n="*" place="margin">Coneil.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19638:11"/>never condeſcend thereunto, &amp; in moving him in that affayre, he ſhall but looſe his labour, and peradventure be repulſed with blame. Well, what then? what doth the Friar? Mary he ſayes, <hi>Courage m<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>n Frers,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further delay, hee excommunicates the party himſelfe. I demaund in this caſe, <hi>Quid juris?</hi> It<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>True it is, That conformable unto the Canons above alledged, as alſo the immemorable cuſtomes &amp; conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of theſe Kingdomes, in caſe of enormous crimes, as Theft, Murder, Perjury, Simony, Hereſie, &amp;c. as alſo diſobedience, proceeding to incorrigibility &amp;c. and that not onely in Clearkes, but in Laicks, unto their Eccleſiaſticall ſuperiours, as Biſhops, &amp; other Prelates, after ſpirituall remedies uſed, as admonitions, cenſures, depoſitions, degradations &amp;c. at the inſtance of the Church upon a <hi>ſiguificavis,</hi> there commonly iſſued out a Writ from the Kings high Court of Chancery, <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piendo excommunicate.

If then our Archbiſh. hath proceeded in this legall manner with his ſubject, &amp; is arrived at the uttermoſt extent of Epiſcopall juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. He may then require the aſſiſtance of the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar arme, by intimating his Proceſſe into the Kings Court of Iuſtice, which if they anſwere his deſires, ſo it is; if not, he muſt reſt contented, and not thinke to erect a new Tribunall, and a new courſe of proceeding, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what before, by authority of Church &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth

For by ſo doing, he may draw the ſword of the Secular arme upon his owne neck, and in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting others, make himſelfe an offendor in the higheſt degree.</p>
            <p>How often doe we finde in former ages? when both Prince and Prelate were of one lip and heart in divine worſhip, and acknowledged obedience unto the Pope in matters ſpirituall. Yet even in thoſe times, did not thoſe Catholique Princes alwayes anſwere the inſtance and requiſition of their Biſhops, in lending them the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of their ſword and ſecular arme, but ſometimes were ſlow and remiſſe in that kinde of correſpondency, yea ſometimes did abſolutely deny the ſame. As who ſo will peruſe the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory of the Church, collected by that learned Card. <hi>Caeſar Baronius</hi> in his Annalls; Or our Countrey-man <hi>Nicholas Harpſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild</hi> in his Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory of <hi>England,</hi> ſhall eaſily finde.

Which matters well pondered by the B. of <hi>Meath,</hi> it is no wonder that hee told our Arch that they were none of his friends that procured him that Commiſſion from <hi>Rome,</hi> to pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſentence of exile againſt any of the Kings Liege people;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19638:12"/>by which act, himſelfe might come to bee in the ſame predicament with <hi>Tho.

            <p>I remember I have read in <hi>Philip Commines</hi> his hiſtory of the warres twixt the French King <hi>Lewis II.</hi> &amp; <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> that in ſome ſervices wherein the French had the worſe, &amp; routed (more upon a <hi>Pannick</hi> feare, then any juſt cauſe of terror) ſome Commanders being after by the King called to an accompt for their cowardiſe: The Author obſerves, &amp; ſo reports it: That certaine Captaines, and great <hi>Monſieurs,</hi> that ran from the field but ſix leagues off, were ſeverely puniſhed for their offences; and others who fled from the field, and ran ten leagues beyond them, were highly rewarded for their valour &amp; good ſervice.

            <p>And ſo it hapned in the cafe of <hi>P. H.</hi> who by Friar <hi>Wadding,</hi> the Archb. his <hi>Agent</hi> in the Citty, and others of his fraternity, as well ſhodd, as bare-footed Friars, his mortall &amp; ſworne enemies, is accuſed to be a moſt tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent; &amp; a ſeditious perſon, diſobedient to all lawfull authority, and as one confirmed in contumacy, remaines incorrigible, and ſo incurable, without hope of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp;c. And thus have the Friars chanted their Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P. Harris</hi> the defendant of his innocencie, in the mean time lyes at anchor in the Port of <hi>Dublin,</hi> little knowing how the windes blow abroad, till upon theſe ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there comes from the Citty, not a Commiſſion to any particular Biſhops, or other Prelats, to examine his cauſe, or to heare what the Archb. can alledge againſt him, or he make anſwer thereunto, but the percloſe of all judiciall proceedings, namely <hi>Sentence,</hi> and that is thought fit to bee of <hi>Exile</hi> out of the Dioceſſe wherein he lives, and that ſentence commanded unto the B. of <hi>Meath</hi> to pronounce.</p>
            <p>But now heare (good Reader) what <hi>Paul Harris</hi> ſaith unto this information. Albeit nothing more, or other can hee ſay, then what he hath delivered in his former Bookes.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:19638:13"/>Cleargy and the Regulars, beſt of all know to bee true: Namely, that this information made by the Archb. and his Friars, unto the Cardinalls at <hi>Rome,</hi> is moſt falſe, moſt unconſcionable &amp; wicked, that it is a meere <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera,</hi> &amp; an <hi>En<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

For it is ſo farre from any ſhadow of verity; That <hi>Paul Harris</hi> hath beene diſobedient unto his Superiour the Archb. or that ever he denyed upon any ſummons, citation or meſſage, to appeare before him, or to anſwer any accuſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or matter, litle or great, layde unto his charge, that in all his life he never recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any meſſage or citation at all from his <hi>Ordinary</hi> which hee hath not obeyed. And this to bee true, the Archb. in his owne conſcience knowes, and none better then himſelfe underſtands the innocencie of <hi>P. H.</hi> in that behalfe. But in caſe it bee otherwiſe, ſince it is a matter of fact, why hath not the Archb. (in all this time ſince <hi>Harris</hi> wrote his two Bookes,) for his owne credit &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and to the greater affront of <hi>P. H.</hi> declared here at home unto ſome ſufficient &amp; underſtanding men either of the Cleargy, or Laity, the falſity of this his ſo bold aſſertion, naming the partyes by whom he ſent his citations, or his meſſages, to what place he called him

For our Archb. &amp; his Friars are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that no Eccleſiaſticall perſons, ought to bee brought before a Temporall Magiſtrate, for what cauſe ſoever; and that the party ſo conventing them, incurres <hi>Excom. De Iure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which <hi>P. H.</hi> anſwers; That no ſuch <hi>Canon</hi> was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver received, or practiſed in theſe Kingdomes, as hee hath largely declared in his former Bookes, and that he preferres the judgement of all antiquity under his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and his Predeceſſours, before the opinion of <hi>Tho.

Since thoſe who are learned in the Lawes, as well Canon, &amp; Civill, as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, doe with one voyce agree, and have aſſured him: That in all cauſes &amp; actions, meerely Civill, of which nature this was, againſt the Prieſt &amp; the <hi>Carmelite</hi> Friar, that as well Biſhops, as Prieſts, Abbots, and Priors, did ſue, and were ſued in the Kings Courts, &amp; none other. If then all Biſhops and Prieſts, Abbots and Friars, who have conſented and allowed of this practiſe, for theſe thouſand yeeres &amp; upward, did maintaine an error, I thinke <hi>P. H.</hi> had better venture upon that error, then u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the skill of a Prelat who never yet ſtudied out of his owne Friary, or tooke degree in any Vniverſity. But this Phyſician who is ſo liberall of his plaſters, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering his abſolutions, before the Penitents aske them:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19638:16"/>Sith he can not cure himſelfe, let him ſeeke a remedy in time for his owne ſores, not being ignorant that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is notoriouſly excommunicated <hi>ab homine,</hi> and by authority of this preſent Pope <hi>Vrbanus 8.</hi> in the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie twixt <hi>Patrick Cahil,</hi> &amp; <hi>Patrick Brangan,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which (to the great ſcandall of Gods Church) we never heard that yet hee received an abſolution.

I ſay all this being granted as moſt true &amp; undoubted, <hi>P. H.</hi> is as cleare from all ſpot of <hi>Excom.</hi> as the ſun-beames, or the water in the fountaine. As how? Forſooth upon this ground; That before he convented thoſe Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall men, to wit, the Prieſt &amp; the Friar above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, hee was denyed all audience and correſpondencie with his Prelate the Archb. either by word or writing, as before hath beene declared &amp; teſtified. In which caſe it is lawfull, not onely for a Prieſt, but for a Layman to ſeeke for Iuſtice at the hands of the Temporall Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, againſt a Cleargy-man, and to convent him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Secular Tribunall: I ſay, in caſe his Prelate refuſe to heare him, or to admit his complaint, or to doe him juſtice, Reade for this <hi>De Iudiciis tit. 1. cap. 7.

Wherfore I conclude, that in conventing his Adverſaryes, though Prieſts, before the Temporall Magiſtrate in Civill cauſes, hee did not incurre any cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>Excom.</hi> being warranted by the Canon above al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged; <hi>In defectum juſtitiae, Clerici ad ſeculare tribunal trahi poſsunt:</hi> For want of Iuſtice, Cleargy-men may be

Such is the influence of that bleſſed aſpect in our dread and no leſſe beloved Soveraigne, with that gracious &amp; propitious Starre, to their perpetuall glory, and our unſpeakable comfort. O then! what pitty is it? That golden Peace, and gowned Reſt, ſhould be the parents of ſo foule an off-ſpring, as is diſcord and diſſention.</p>
            <p>Is it? That we have already ſurfetted of Eaſe, and in ſo ſhort a time become weary of ſo long-expected a well-fare, that now (the rod and rigour of State being removed) we ſhould embolden our ſelves upon dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall broyles.</p>

            <p>Verily, if our Friars had but read their <hi>Eſopſ</hi> fables,

            <p>Alas! have theſe men ſo ſoone forgotten S. <hi>Stevens</hi> day? when for the non-obſervance of ſome points of a Proclamation, all our Houſes and Oratoryes were in one houre ſeaſed unto the Kings uſe.

            </p>
            <p>And as touching this union of Charity and Iuſtice: It is not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the purpoſe to recount an accident which hapned in <hi>Sivill</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> in the time that my ſelfe lived there. A certaine Iudge of a Court, called in their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage an <hi>Oydor,</hi> riding ſomewhat late in the evening, was by his enemy who ſought his life, aſſaulted in the ſtreet, and by whom he was mortally wounded, yet ſo as he lived in perfect ſenſe &amp; memory ſome few dayes after.

To whom ſayth the wounded Iudge, being at hand to yeeld up the Ghoſt: Yes brother, from the Tyles of the Houſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I freely forgive thee; but from the Tyles down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I deſire Iuſtice may bee done upon thee. And in the ſame minde that hee was dying, am I now living; From the Thatch of the Houſe upward, I freely forgive all my adverſaryes, perſecutors, and enemyes: That is,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19638:20"/>I deſire all heavenly graces &amp; good gifts from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lights to deſcend downe upon them, and after this life, the ſalvation of their ſoules in Heaven: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over I deſire that the good Angells of GOD may keep them in all their wayes, &amp; protect them from all harme in body, goods, &amp; good name.

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing lately in the Country, it was my chance in ſome communication with one of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, to ask of him, if he knew, or could gueſſe, how the Cardinalls Letters were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and came to the hands of <hi>Dublinenſis,</hi> whether by the poſt of <hi>Paris,</hi> or <hi>Antwerp,</hi> &amp;c. He anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red very pleaſantly, he could ſoone reſolve mee in that point, and that they neither came by the way of <hi>Paris</hi> or <hi>Antwerp,</hi> but by the way of <hi>Loretto.</hi> Your reaſon quoth I. Why? quoth he, wot you not that there paſſed from <hi>Ireland</hi> certaine Pilgrims for <hi>Loretto</hi> the laſt yeare, &amp; ſo from <hi>Loretto,</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and returned back this laſt Spring? Now, before they returned home from their pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, there was not a word ſpoken of theſe Letters; but ſince their arrivall, all the Countrey hath ſounded of them. This diſcourſe of my friend, made mee remember a paſſage which I read ſome 50. yeares agoe, in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of <hi>Hugh Latimer,</hi> which as then, ſo I now relate, to parallell his conceit.</p>
            <p>It hapned in the dayes of <hi>Henry 8.</hi> that many ſhips be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt away upon the coaſt of <hi>Kent,</hi> eſpecially in that place which to this day is called <hi>Goodwins ſands.</hi> The Councel thought good to grant a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion to examin ſuch as were of the moſt ancient inhabitants of thoſe parts, if there could be any cauſe found thereof, who
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19638:21"/>being called to <hi>Dover,</hi> were required to ſay their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in that caſe, what they thought might be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe dangerous ſeas &amp; ſands, now infamous for ſhipwracks, which informer times had no ſuch note of danger. Among the examined, one old man ſtood up &amp; told the Commiſſioners, that for his part, he wiſt well what was the cauſe of thoſe troubleſome ſands, which ſwallowed up ſo many ſhips, and by my hood (ſayth he) it is no other then <hi>Tenderton ſteeple.</hi> I ſay (quoth he) and will abide by it, that <hi>Tenderton ſteeple</hi> is the cauſe of <hi>Goodwin ſands.</hi> For I can well remember the building of <hi>Tenderton ſteeple,</hi> and before it was built, there was no <hi>Goodwin ſands,</hi> but ſoon after the building of that ſteeple I could heare the ſea-faring men in the Church-yard after Even-ſong, and in the Ale-houſe, complaine much of thoſe ſands, and they would tell, how ſuch a ſhip, ſuch a Barque or Pinnace was there ſunke &amp;c. Well, well, quoth my friend (interrupting me) it is enough, you have very ſtrongly confirmed my opinion of the Letters; but what matter is it whether the Pilgrims are the cauſe of <hi>Goodwins ſands,</hi> or <hi>Tenderton ſteeple</hi> brought the Letters fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Rome,</hi> let thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the matter concernes more then you &amp; me, look to it. For ſince they have the threed by the end, they know how to wynde it up. But ſince by this occaſion we are fallen into mention of the Pilgrimage of <hi>Loretto,</hi> I pray you reſolve what opinion you hold of that ſtrange Houſe of our Ladyes, of which there runneth ſo great a fame, as it drawes us out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from our Houſes, Wives &amp; Children, to the great danger of our perſons, &amp; expence of our purſes, unleſſe for ſuch as make a bon voyage of it, &amp; receive fifteene for five at their returne home. And as for the miracles,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19638:22"/>we heare very much with our cares, but wee ſee little with our eyes; neither the blind or deafe to returne wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſed: as for the halt and the lame, I leſſe marvaile, for few of them can reach ſo farre. Nay bir lady, I have known ſome to carry hence a paire of good leggs with them, &amp; ſcarce have brought them ſo ſound back again. Beſides they tell us, that Houſe did uſe to flye in the aire, by ſea &amp; land, above a thouſand leagues: now it is ſtrange to us, that a Houſe that hath no leggs to goe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, ſhould have wings to flye withall. Of theſe &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters no leſſe wonderfull, I pray you ſhew us the truth, and how farre they may bee beleeved; for I confeſſe, God's above all &amp;c. And I thinke by this time there was as many gathered about to liſten to our talke, as were aſſembled in Queene <hi>Dido's</hi> Hall, to heare <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> diſcourſe of the <hi>Trojan</hi> warre.</p>
            <p>Well then (quoth I) if ſo great a longing you have to heare the hiſtory of the <hi>Lauretan</hi> Houſe, &amp; the ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious wonders of that holy place. Albeit the lights u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon yonder cup-bord are now ſpent farre below their waſtes, &amp; ſo invite us rather to retire our ſelves unto our lodgings, then to begin any new diſcourſe: yet to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your no leſſe earneſt, then harmleſſe curioſity, I will begin.</p>
            <p>Know then, that I have not onely read and heard of this Houſe but I have ſeen the ſame, and (which I more eſteeme) my ſelfe within it. And for the reaſons which ſhall after be alleadged) I am perſwaded this is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame Houſe in which the bleſſed Virgin the Mother of GOD was borne, in which ſhe received the Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſalutation, and in which the Saviour of the World in his infancie was nurſed and bred.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19638:23"/>It ſeemes to me not much different from a miraculous preſervation, that <hi>M.

Memorable is that alſo &amp; in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not much ſhort of a miracle: That <hi>Horatius Cocles,</hi> a valiant <hi>Roman,</hi> &amp; blind of one eye, by his alone proweſſe with-ſtood <hi>Porſenna</hi> King of the <hi>Tuſcans,</hi> &amp; his whole Army, invading the Citty, &amp; ſtanding upon the bridge, defended the paſſage, &amp; made it good, one man againſt a multitude, till ſuch time as his Citizens (being at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, &amp; not underſtanding of that danger) comming to their doores and windowes, and ſeeing in what eſtate matters were, iſſued forth to his ayde, and breaking downe the bridge behinde him, hee with no leſſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, threw himſelfe into the river <hi>Tibris,</hi> and in his Armour, ſwamme unto the Citty ſhoare without any harme.

And muſt whatſoever is related by ſo many pious Authors, and conſented unto, by the Suffrages (in a manner) of all
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19638:23"/>Chriſtians, as touching that ſacred Houſe of <hi>Loretto,</hi> be throwne out of doores? To come to Eccleſiaſticall hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, we reade that <hi>Gregory,</hi> B. of <hi>Neoceſarea,</hi> called (for his great &amp; many miracles) <hi>Thaumaturgus,</hi> removed a Rock out of his place; &amp; this is related by no meaner an Author then the great <hi>S. Baſil,</hi> a Primative Father, and an ancient Doctor of Gods Church, who doubteth not to compare the aforeſaid <hi>Gregory,</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets &amp; the Apoſtles. This S. <hi>Gregory</hi> lived in the yeare 233. after our Saviour, &amp; S. <hi>Baſil</hi> 370. both of them in the Primitive times of the Church. We know who ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Diſciples, if they had faith, as a graine of muſtard ſeed, they ſhould ſay unto this mountaine, remove hence, &amp; it ſhould obey, <hi>Math. 17.</hi> And the like of the Mulberry tree. <hi>Luke 17.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither doe I applaud that opinion, that maintaines all miracles to have ceaſed with the Apoſtles and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Saviour. For (methinkes) that doctrine is not conſonant to theſe Scriptures, <hi>Mar. 16. Signa autem cos qui crediderint hac ſequentur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The ſignes that ſhall follow ſuch as beleeve, are theſe; In my Name ſhall they cast out devils, they ſhall ſpeake with new tongues, they ſhall take away ſerpents, &amp; if they drinke any thing that is deadly, it ſhall not hurt them: they ſhall lay hands upon the ſick, &amp; they ſhall be healed, &amp;c.</hi> Of which miracles, albeit ſome of them were wrought by the Apoſtles, and recorded in their <hi>Acts,</hi> yet why this Scripture may not extend to the faithfull in all ages, according to that order &amp; diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gifts, layde downe by the Apoſtle, <hi>1. Cor. 12.</hi> I would willingly underſtand? <hi>And ſome verily GOD hath ſet in the Church: firſt Apostles, ſecondly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, thirdly Doctours, next miracles, then the graces
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19638:24"/>of doing cures, helpes, governments, kindes of tongues. Are all Apoſtles? Are all Prophets? Are all Doctors? Are all Miracles? Have all the grace of doing cures? Doe all ſpeake with tongues? Doe all interpret?</hi> This text then that proves unto us, that in the Church are placed Doctors, helpes, &amp; governments, tells us alſo, that in the ſame, GOD hath ſet miracles, &amp; graces of healing; neither was the Church which our bleſſed Saviour purchaſed with his owne Bloud, and the Holy Ghoſt, enriched with thoſe divine graces, to endure only for the time of the Apoſtles, and the 42. Diſciples, but even unto his ſecond comming, &amp; yeelding up his government into the hands of his Father. By the ſame reaſon then that they exclude miracles, they muſt alſo exile Doctours, helpes, &amp; governments out of the Church, all conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Apoſtle in one catalogue, &amp; theſe later con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be perpetuall in the Church. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> the 4. and conſequently the former. Againe, our Saviour ſayth, <hi>Iohn 14.12. Amen, amen I ſay unto you, he that beleeveth in me, the workes that I doe, he alſo ſhall doe, and greater workes then theſe ſhall be doe.</hi> But we finde not this Scripture ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in any of the Apoſtles, or of his Diſciples, or in all of them put together, whoſe miracles (ſo farre forth as we reade of them in holy Writ) did neither in number or excellencie, equall our Saviours miracles, and much leſſe exceede them. Who then be they that ſhall doe greater workes then our Saviour did? but the faithfull who were to ſucceed in the future ages of the Church? of which times now to deſcend to ſpeake, me thinkes it would argue either too much ſimplicitie, or ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to diſcredit all thoſe miracles, aſcribed as well to the Saints departed this life, and their Reliques, as to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19638:24"/>the living; by thoſe Fathers and Doctours of Gods Church, who for their antiquity, ſanctity, and learning, all ages have, and ever ſhall admire.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Iohn Chryſoſtome,</hi> in a whole Booke againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, proveth that Chriſt was God, becauſe he wrought miracles, not onely by S. <hi>Peters</hi> ſhadow, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> his hand-kerchiefe, but alſo by the reliques and monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Saints, and namely by the aſhes of S. <hi>Babilas.</hi> As Almighty GOD by the bones of the Prophet <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeus</hi> gave life unto a dead corps, ſo ſoone as it touched them, <hi>4. Reg. 13.</hi> See for this S. <hi>Chryſost. lib. de Babilamar. tom. 5.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Euſebius.</hi> B. of <hi>Caeſarca,</hi> who flouriſhed in the yeare 326. reports in his Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory, That the woman who was cured by our Saviour of a Flux of Bloud, <hi>Mat. 9.</hi> having the Image of our Saviour made of braſſe, and placed before her doore, there did grow up a certaine ſtrange hearbe at the foot of the Image, which ſo ſoone as in growth it came to touch the hemme of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours garment in that <hi>Statua,</hi> it became medicinable to the curing of all infirmityes, but being taken before it ſprung up to that height, it had no vertue at all. And the ſame Author tells us, that this ſame braſen Image of our Saviour continued till his time, and that he ſaw it with his owne eyes. <hi>Euſeb. eccleſ. hiſtor. lib. 7. cap. 14.</hi>

            <p>What ſhal we ſay unto the miracles wrought by S. <hi>Paul.</hi> the firſt Hermite, and by <hi>Hilarion,</hi> recorded by S. <hi>Hierom?</hi> The miracles of many Saints, wrought at their tombes and monuments, teſtified by S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Bookes <hi>De civitate Dei?</hi> The miracles of S. <hi>Martin,</hi> written by <hi>Severus Sulpitius.</hi> The innumerable miracles of the holy <hi>Ermites,</hi> living in the deſarts of <hi>Lybia,</hi> recounted by <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oderet</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:19638:25"/>in his religious hiſtory? The miracles approved by S <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great in his Dialogues? The miracles reported by S. <hi>Bede</hi> in his Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory &amp; lives of Saints? with infinite others, recorded by Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Writers of later times: muſt all theſe bee ranked with the Legends of <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi> of <hi>Huyon</hi> of <hi>Burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,</hi> of <hi>Primaleon</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> or the <hi>Knight of the Sun?</hi> O no: neither judgment, nor piety can allow of it.</p>
            <p>But to draw to a concluſion, That it may appeare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſenſes, that miracles are not ceaſed, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among us even till theſe times: And that Almighty GOD hath not ſo reſtrained his power to the Ordinary courſe of ſecondary cauſes, as that ſometimes, and ſo often as he is pleaſed, he tranſcendeth not all the works of Nature, ſhewing ſuch wonders among us, as that the moſt refractary cannot but ſay with the unbeleeving <hi>Iewes, Act. 4.16. Ecce manifeſtum ſignum factum eſt, &amp; non poſſumus negare:</hi> Behold, a manifeſt miracle is wrought among us, and we cannot deny it. I will then only inſiſt in that kinde of miracle which is called: <hi>Gratia ſanitatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the gift of healing diſeaſes, inſerted in the Liſt of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, both by our Saviour, <hi>Mar. 16.</hi> and by the Apoſtle <hi>1. Cor. 12.</hi> which gift <hi>ab effectis,</hi> is apparant to have beene conferred from above, unto two Chriſtian Princes, as it were by an hereditary deſcent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> immemorable times, namely, the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King, who onely by the touch of their hands. (calling upon Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD) doc cure that diſeafe which in Greeke is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in Latine <hi>ſtruma,</hi> and in our Engliſh tongue ſcarce known by any other name then the <hi>Kings evill,</hi> ſoyclepped from the Crowned Curers. Neither is this infirmity helped by any other Prince, or Potentate
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19638:25"/>upon Earth, but by thoſe two ſacred &amp; anointed Kings, neither have they the gift of helping any other diſeaſe or infirmity in mans body, this onely excepted. By what then hath beene ſaid, as touching the authentica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of miracles, as well in moderne, as ancient times, I ſee not but according to the weight &amp; worth of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters, they may receive admittance: It being no leſſe a fault of indiſcretion to beleeve nothing, as to beleeve every thing in that kinde publiſhed.</p>
            <p>And now in the laſt place, it remaines to anſwere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my friends objection, made in the beginning of this Chap. That (forſooth) many infirme &amp; diſeaſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons returne from <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; <hi>Loretto,</hi> &amp; other holy places, with as little health as they paſſed hence; which diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie ſhal be the better reſolved, if wee conſider the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of Pilgrimes, and digeſt them into their ſeverall rankes: Sith among thoſe that paſſe into forraine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes, you have in a manner as many ends &amp; purpoſes, as perſons.</p>
            <p>For firſt we have the <hi>Curious</hi> Pilgrim, whom co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we call the <hi>Traveller,</hi> either ſome yong Gallant in his minority, or lately wived, or who either upon ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content leaving their home, &amp; friends, make the ſcope &amp; end of their peregrination (according to the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation) to furniſh themſelves with knowledge &amp; experience, obſerving the various manners of Men and Cittyes, &amp; not alwayes in motion, but ſometimes at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor in ſome famous Vniverſity, to heare a <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> a <hi>Plato,</hi> or an <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Who (to obſerve that ſhort precept of <hi>Tully</hi>) it ſhall never repent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming home. <hi>Peregrini, &amp; incolae officium est, nihil praeter negotium ſuum agere. Officer.</hi> It becomes a Pilgrim, and an Inmaco, to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19638:26"/>meddle with nothing but his owne affaires. Neither would I wiſh this our curious Pilgrim to bee too long abſent from home, leſt he taſte of ſuch diſcommodities as <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> did, at his returne to <hi>Ithaca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our ſecond Pilgrime is the <hi>Covetous</hi> Pilgrim, a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer, though no merchant, who deſignes his voyage to ſome one ſet place, admitting a probability of danger, either in reſpect of the Countrey ſo remote, or of the indiſpoſition of his body, for age, or infirmity, in regard whereof, he covenants before he departs from his own ſmoake, to multiply the greater, by the leſſer number, according to the expoſing of his Dollors, Dublons, Rings, Chaynes, Iewels, Horſes, Coaches, &amp; what not: That at his returne (if ever) he may ſay.
<q>—I am mihi quarto: I am decies redit in rugam. <bibl>Perſ. Sat. 6.</bibl>
               </q>
his Creditors at home (in the meane time) curſing thoſe leggs that ſhall ever bring him back.</p>
            <p>Our third Pilgrim, is the <hi>Counterfeit</hi> Pilgrim, who under pretence of devotion, viſiting the moſt memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Pilgrimages of Chriſtendome, he walkes by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall Churches, Abbayes, &amp; Hoſpitalls, not diſday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning alſo <hi>(Si ſpes refulſerit nummi)</hi> to viſit places of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour note. To which purpoſe, as the prologue to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended &amp; pretended Pilgrimage, he puts himſelfe into a Pilgrims Habit, which is a gray Friſe coat, ſide to the mid-legg, well girt unto him, a ſtiffe felt of a courſe hat of the ſame colour, a ſtrong aſhen ſtaff in his hand about his own pitch, with two bigg knots toward the upper end. His knapſack, and his Calavas, accommodated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his left arme, with the proviſion in them of an <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> Arke. And to the end it may appeare, that he beggs
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19638:26"/>not of any neceſſity, but onely like a young <hi>Ieſuite</hi> for mortification, his holland-ſhirt hangs halfe a foot out of his ſleeve at the hand, &amp; below his Friſe Habit, you ſhall diſcover a faire ſilke ſtocking upon his legg, for by that ſleight he ſhall be held by ſtrangers, a man of note &amp; faſhion in his Countrey, &amp; that thorough extremity of piety, he travells ſo diſguiſed, to give ſatiſfaction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſuppoſed moſt ſincere devotion, either volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily undertaken, or injoyned for pennance. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the needy beggar, veſted as well in-ſide, as out-ſide, with pure unfayned poverty, ſhall with much importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity get a penny, this <hi>Counterfeit</hi> will purchaſe a pound, and after a few moneths, returnes home, like a Spaniſh Gallion from the Weſt <hi>Indyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our fourth Pilgrim, who from his motion may bee termed the <hi>Rolling</hi> Pilgrim, being very penurious, makes a vertue of neceſſity, no leſſe mindful of his wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let then of his devotion, eating the ſinnes of the people by whom he paſſeth, whoſe travells commonly do end either with his health, or with his life, imitating the motion of the heavenly bodies; for as they rolle about the circumference, ſo he about the center. Neither doth it much import where he beginnes, ſince hee is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined where to conclude &amp; make an end. Meeting him then upon the borders of <hi>France,</hi> comming from the never-waſting taper of <hi>Arras,</hi> he tends for <hi>Amiens</hi> in <hi>Picardy,</hi> there to viſite the head of S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt.</hi> Thence he paſſeth to S. <hi>Denis,</hi> where beſides many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rare Reliques in rich incloſures, he doth reverence the <hi>thorne</hi> of our Saviours Crowne. And ſo to <hi>Paris,</hi> proſtrated at the ſhrine of <hi>S. Genovefa,</hi> neither forgets he in his walke the reſt of the <hi>nostre Dames</hi> of <hi>France:</hi> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19638:27"/>to <hi>Marſells</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> hee religiouſly adores the Reliques of <hi>S. Lazarus,</hi> whom our Saviour <hi>Iohn 11.</hi> raiſed to life: next hee arrives at <hi>Baubne,</hi> where hee ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his devotion at the body of the bleſſed <hi>Magdalen,</hi> who anointed our Saviours head, and waſhed his feete with her teares: Then entring into <hi>Savoy,</hi> &amp; paſſing the <hi>Alpine</hi> rocks &amp; mountaines of ſnow, hee deſcends into <hi>Piemont,</hi> where he viſits the Reliques of <hi>S. Euſebius</hi> B. of <hi>Vercells.</hi> At <hi>Millan</hi> in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> he viſits the monument of <hi>S. Ambroſe;</hi> as alſo of <hi>S. Carolus Borromeus,</hi> both Biſh. of that place: thence to <hi>Padua,</hi> to honour the Reliques of <hi>S.

And ſo leaving <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> he coaſts over <hi>Siera Morena,</hi> to <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos,</hi> to worſhip the ſweating Crucifix: &amp; never reſts till he arrive at the body of <hi>S.

Nothing more encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a man to draw out the threed of his ſpeech to the ful length, then attentive Auditors, which I have found you hitherto to be. Having then paſſed through ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pilgrimes: The <hi>Curious,</hi> the <hi>Covetous,</hi> the <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> and the <hi>Wanderer,</hi> Give me leave to adde to that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the fift, which is the <hi>Distreſſed</hi> Pilgrim, in ſpeaking of whom, had you my friend not interrupted my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe happily by this time I had given you an account of what you deſired at my hands in the beginning, which (if I doe not miſtake) is this.</p>
            <p>How comes it to paſſe (ſay you) That in thoſe which you call holy places, and have in ſo high an eſtimation, &amp; glory ſo much of their miracles? That we behold ſo great a number of Halt, Blinde, Deafe, Dumbe, lamed of their limmes, diſeaſed of their bodies, of Dropſies, Palſies, Conſumptions, Convulſions, Gouts, Sciaticks, Phrenſies, Ielouſies, Epilepſies, &amp;c? ſo few to be cured, or to returne home ſound of winde, &amp; lim, &amp; in perfect health? To which I anſwere. It ſeemes no more ſtrange then that ſo many ſitting at home, (where they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD ſtill preſent with them) doe not recover of the ſame infirmities, For albeit we heare it ſaid, <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te &amp; dabitur vobis, quarite &amp; invenietis, pulſate &amp; aperietur
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:19638:29"/>vobis. Luc. 11.</hi> Aske, &amp; it ſhalbe given you; ſeeke, &amp; you ſhall find; knock, &amp; it ſhalbe opened unto you. Yet <hi>S. Iames</hi> ſaith. <hi>Petitis &amp; non accipitis, eò quòd malè petatis, Iac. 4.</hi> You aske &amp; you receive not, &amp; the reaſon is added, becauſe you aske amiſſe. Whether then at home, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, you aske amiſſe; that is, either things unlawfull, or in complacency of ſin, or with an inordinat deſire, as of health, or any other temporall benefit, which happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denyed, is better then obtayned. This inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, not conformable to the will of GOD, &amp; repugnant unto our ſoules health, may be a ſufficient impediment of not receiving what is asked. Our <hi>diſtreſsed</hi> Pilgrime repaires unto <hi>Loretto;</hi> he ſpeeds not; he went blinde, he returnes blinde; he went crooked, he returnes with the ſame <hi>Nemeſis</hi> upon his ſhoulders; hee went hence with two good legges, hee comes limping home; hee went with a Dropſie, he comes home with a Timpany; hee went to be cured of his phrenſie, or his jealouſie, and he returnes madd. Was there then any inſufficiencie of almighty GOD, to have ſupplyed theſe defects, or to have remedied theſe diſeaſes at the memory of his Saints? O no. The Poet could ſay, <hi>Perſ. Sat. 2.</hi>

            <p>It is ſaid of our Saviour, <hi>Mar. 6.</hi> That in his owne Countrey of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> by reaſon of their incredulity, <hi>Non poterat virtutem ullam facere,</hi> he could not worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miracle, but onely heale a few ſick perſons. Not that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19638:29"/>our Saviour being GOD, could not work miracles, but that on their part there wanted apt diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city unto them. Of which diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, <hi>Faith</hi> is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall? &amp; note, that <hi>Non poſſum</hi> is often in the Scriptures put for <hi>Nolo,</hi> I will not. So our Saviour ſayth in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell: The children of the Kingdome cannot faſt while he be with them, <hi>non poſsunt jejunare,</hi> as much as to ſay, <hi>nolunt jejunare,</hi> they will not faſt. So when a man takes himſelfe to be wronged, hee will commonly ſay, I can not put up this wrong at his hands: I can not diſgeſt it: as much to ſay, I will not.</p>
            <p>Againe, we muſt not inferre, that where diſpoſitions requiſite in the perſon of the Patient are found, as a true faith, purity of heart, reſignation to the will of GOD, that there is alwayes the benefit of cure in their corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall infirmityes, becauſe it is ever a ruled caſe: That our heavenly Father knowes what we have need of, &amp; what is beſt for us: many moe being driven by adverſity to ſeeke out their ſalvation, then by proſperity: thoſe who have but one eye, one foot, one hand, entring into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when others who have two eyes, feet, hands, are caſt into hell fire. <hi>Mark. 9.</hi> And we know the Parable of the Sun &amp; the Wind. Albeit then we ſee twenty for one returning from ſuch places (where almighty GOD is pleaſed ſometimes to work miracles, in honor of thoſe who on earth were his faithfull &amp; true ſervants, &amp; now triumphant in Heaven) laboring ſtill of thoſe maladies, for which they ſought relief at the memories of Saints, It would be great preſumption &amp; temerity in us, to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, much more to judge, that they were not prepared for ſo great a benefit. We know what Apology our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour made in the caſe of the man blinde from his nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19638:30"/>When as the <hi>Iewes</hi> demanded of him, <hi>Quis peccavit, hic, aut parentes ejus, ut coecus naſeeretur? Iohn 9.</hi> Who was it that ſinned, he, or his parents, that he ſhould be borne blind: The anſwer was, <hi>Ne<expan>

            <p>Beſides, it is not to bee doubted of, but many infirme &amp; diſeaſed people repaire to ſuch places, more for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion &amp; ſpiritual comfort, then for any deſire, or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their bodily health. <hi>Non ut benè ſit pedi, aut la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri, ſed ut benè ſit anima:</hi> not ſo tender of the well-fare of their corruptible bodies, as of that immortall part, which is, and ought to be moſt deare unto them. And ſo much (my friend) to anſwere your difficulty, why ſo many returne from pilgrimages without reparation of their health.</p>
            <p>The laſt knot to be untyed in this Argument, (&amp; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſinuated by you, then clearely propounded) is this. How is it to be beleeved ſay ſome? That ſo many ſignes and works ſurpaſſing all power of Nature, which we call miracles, ſhould be wrought at the memory and monuments of Saints, rather then in other places. The omnipotencie of GOD (the Author both of Nature, Grace, and all miraculous workes) being one and the ſame in all places and times.</p>
            <p>To as many as urge this reaſon, and thinke it worthy to be inſiſted upon. I might ſay as our Saviour ſaid unto the <hi>Sadducees, Math. 23. Erratis neſcientes ſcripturas, &amp; vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutem Dei:</hi> You erre, not knowing the Scriptures, or the power of GOD. Our bleſſed Saviour tells us, <hi>Luke 4.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19638:30"/>Quòd multa erans vidua, &amp;c.</hi> That there were many Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes in the dayes of <hi>Elias</hi> in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were ſhut for 3. yeares and ſix moneths, in which time there was a great famine thorough the whole earth, and unto none of thoſe was <hi>Elias</hi> ſent, but in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repta</hi> of <hi>Sidonia,</hi> unto one Woman a Widow. And there were many Lepers in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Elizeus</hi> the Prophet, and none of them was cleanſed, but <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian.</hi> Now what was the cauſe why no other Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow was exempted from that famine, but only the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Sarepta?</hi> Becauſe (notwithſtanding the preſence of GOD in all places) there wanted alſo the preſence of the Prophet <hi>Elias.</hi> And why were not the reſt of the Lopers clennſed, but onely <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian?</hi> wanted there the power of GOD, or due preparation in the Subject: Who can ſay ſo? No, but the preſence of the Prophet <hi>Elizeus.</hi> By which we ſee the circumſtance of perſonall preſence, though not neceſſary unto the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yet many times required unto the will of the worker of ſignes and wonders. And albeit our Saviour in the Goſpell, ſometimes did cure the abſent, to givers to underſtand, that his power was not reſtrayned to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, yet commonly, and ſo the moſt part, hee cured none but the preſent: and ſo the people did underſtand, both by laying his hands upon them in the Cure: As when by reaſon of the preſſe of people, they uncovered the roofe of the houſe, <hi>Mar. 2.</hi> to let downe the Parali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique in his bed before him. So the Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> raiſed not the Widowes ſon to life, before him ſelfe came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. And our Saviour went unto the grave of <hi>Lazarus</hi> before he revived him. He took the Governors Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the hand, <hi>Math. 9.</hi> as alſo in <hi>Naum</hi> he touched the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:19638:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>Coffin of the dead, before he rayſed them to life.</p>
            <p>And no leſſe alſo doe we behold a preſence required even in thoſe liveleſſe inſtruments, which it pleaſeth the divine Wiſdome to uſe in this kind. So the bones of the Prophet <hi>Elizeus,</hi> quickned the dead Corps throwne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his grave, by a Phyſicall touch or contact. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Iordan</hi> in like manner, the leproſie. The <hi>Hemoriſsa</hi> (being ſo many yeares diſeaſed) found no cure, till ſhe touched the hemme of our Saviours garment. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the pond in <hi>Hieruſalem, Iohn 5.</hi> did not heale be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were touched. S. <hi>Peters</hi> ſhadow, healed none but ſuch as it paſſed over. And the Napkins &amp; Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes which were ſent from the Body of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> being applyed, did not onely cure diſeaſes, but caſt out devils <hi>Acts 19.</hi> By which, &amp; many other examples (which for brevity I omit) it may appeare, that either Preſence, Application, or Phyſical contact in moſt miracles, have beene required as a condition to the effecting of them. That we may the leſſe marvaile, if preſent at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and monuments of Saints, we receive thoſe helps both ſpirituall and temporall, which being abſent, wee might miſſe of.</p>
            <p>And ſo I conclude this Chap. of Pilgrimages, my ſelfe unfit for thoſe ttavells, to which ſome againſt my will, moſt willingly would compell me. And now our artificial ſtarres being ready to ſet, &amp; to deſcend below their Horizons. It is time to end that diſcourſe, to which your attention hath thus farre drawne me. And ſo wiſhing all well-fare &amp; happines to the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, I bid you all good-night: reſolving my ſelfe to ſleepe, till ſome other occaſion ſhall awake mee.</p>
