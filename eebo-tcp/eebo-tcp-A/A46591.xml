            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>His Majeſties REASONS For With-drawing Himſelf from ROCHESTER.</head>
            <head type="sub">Writ with his own Hand, and Ordered by Him to be Publiſhed.</head>
            <p>THE World cannot wonder at my With-drawing my Self now this Second time. I might have expected ſomewhat better Uſage after what I writ to the P. of <hi>Orange</hi> by my Lord <hi>Feverſham,</hi> and the Inſtructions I gave him; but inſtead of an Anſwer, ſuch as I might have hoped for, What was I to expect after the Uſage I received by the making the ſaid Earl a <hi>Priſoner,</hi> againſt the Practice and Law of Nations; <hi>The ſending his own Guards at Eleven at Night to take Poſſeſſion of the Poſts at Whitehall,</hi> without advertiſing me in the leaſt manner of it; <hi>The ſending to me at One a Clock, after Midnight, when I was in Bed, a kind of an Order by three Lords, to be gone out of mine own Palace, before Twelve that ſame Morning?</hi> After all this, How could I hope to be ſafe, ſo long as I was in the Power of one, who had not only done this to me, and Invaded my Kingdoms without any juſt occaſion given him for it, but that did by his firſt Declaration lay the greateſt Aſperſion upon me that Malice could Invent, in that Clauſe of it which concerns my <hi>Son.</hi> I appeal to all that know me, nay, even to himſelf, that in their Conſciences, neither he nor they can believe me <hi>in the leaſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſo unnatural a Villany,</hi> nor of ſo little common ſenſe, to be impoſed on in a thing of ſuch a nature as that. What had I then to expect from one who by all Arts hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſuch pains to make me appear as black as Hell to my own People, as well as to all the World beſides? What effect that had at Home all mankind have ſeen, by ſo <hi>General a defection</hi> in my Army, as well as in the Nation, amongſt all ſorts of People.</p>
            <p>I was born <hi>Free,</hi> and deſire to continue ſo; and tho I have <hi>ventured my Life</hi> very frankly, on ſeveral Occaſions, for the Good and Honour of my Countrey, and am as free to do it again (<hi>and which I hope I ſhall yet do, as Old as I am, to redeem it from the Slavery it is like to fall under</hi>) yet I think it not convenient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe my ſelf to be Secured, as not to be at Liberty to Effect it; and for that, Reaſon do with-draw, but ſo as to be within call whenſoever the Nations Eyes ſhall be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo as to ſee how they have been abuſed and impoſed upon by the <hi>ſpecious Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Religion and Property.</hi> I hope it will pleaſe God to <hi>touch</hi> their Hearts, out of his infinite Mercy, and to make them ſenſible of the ill Condition they are in, and bring them to ſuch a temper, that a <hi>Legal Parliament</hi> may be called; and that amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which may be neceſſary to be done, they will agree to <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> for all Proteſtant Diſſenters, and that thoſe of of my own Perſwaſion may be ſo far Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and have ſuch a ſhare of it, <hi>as they may live peaceably and quietly,</hi> as Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Chriſtians ought to do, and not to be obliged to <hi>Tranſplant</hi> themſelves, which would be very grievous, eſpecially to ſuch as love their own Countrey; and I appeal to all men, who are conſidering men, and have had experience, whether any thing can make this Nation ſo great and flouriſhing as <hi>Liberty of Conſcience.</hi> Some of our Neighbours dread it.</p>
            <p>I could add much more to confirm all I have ſaid, but now is not the proper time.</p>
