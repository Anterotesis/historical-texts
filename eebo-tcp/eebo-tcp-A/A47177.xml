            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>Iſaiah xxxviii. xix.</bibl>
               <q>The Living, the Living he ſhall praiſe
thee, as I do this Day.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <head>Compared with Pſal. 18. 46, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT is a certain Teſtimony which the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
gives concerning thoſe that praiſe God,
according to the Words of that good King <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi>
a Faithful Servant of the Lord, <hi>For the
Grave cannot praiſe thee, Death cannot celebrate thee,
they that go down into the Pit cannot hope for thy Truth.</hi>
How is this to be underſtood? Do not the Deceaſed
Saints Praiſe God? Yes certainly they do, to wit
their Souls and Spirits which die not: Though their
Bodies die, their Souls Praiſe God. Who then are theſe
Dead which the Scripture teſtifies do not Praiſe God?
I Anſwer, ſuch as are dead in their Sins and Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes;
for Sin hath brought that Spiritual Death over
Men and Women that they are not capable to Praiſe
God nor ſerve him any manner of way acceptably,
till he breath upon them, and quicken them by his
Living Breathings, and by that Living Vertue and
Power which proceeds from him. Now Holy <hi>David</hi>
was very ſenſible of this when he ſaith, in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Pſalm, <hi>The Lord liveth, and bleſſed be my Rock:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 46.</note>
               <hi>and let the God of my ſalvation be exalted.</hi> That Man
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45873:3"/>
or Woman that can ſay this, <hi>The Lord liveth,</hi> from a
true inward and Spiritual Senſe of his Living Power
and Preſence, that hath quickened them and made
them alive, made them ſenſible of his Power and
Mercy, of his great <hi>Deliverance</hi> and Preſervation,
theſe are only fit to ſay, <hi>Bleſſed be my Rock: and let the
God of my ſalvation be exalted.</hi> But alas! How few are
there in compariſon that can ſpeak theſe words in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
of Heart and from true experience, <hi>The Lord
liveth?</hi> Thoſe that can ſpeak it in an acceptable way
from true experience, they know the Revelation of
Gods mighty Arm and living Power in their Hearts
and Souls; They know that the Lord is the only Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and True God; There is no other God like to
him: The Idols of the Nations are falſe Gods. The
<hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks thus of them,<note place="margin">Pſal. 135. 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>The Idols of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
are ſilver and gold, the work of mens hands. They
have mouths, but they ſpeak not; eyes have they, but they
ſee not. They have ears, but they hear not; neither is
there any breath in their mouths. They that make them
are like unto them: ſo is every one that truſteth in them.</hi>
But <hi>David</hi>'s God, the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and
<hi>Jacob,</hi> he is the True and Living God. Dead Idols
can neither do good nor evil, but God is a preſent
Help in trouble. God is the Living and True God;
they that have an Inward Senſe and Experience of
his Mighty Power that hath quickened them,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 1, 4.</note> and
made them alive, they alone can praiſe him in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
manner. Thoſe that are under the Power
of Sin, and under its Reign and Government, they
are under the Power of Death, and the Dead cannot
praiſe him. Death reigneth over them, Spiritual
Death;<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Death reigned from Adam to Moſes, even over
them that had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of Adams
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45873:3"/>
tranſgreſſion.</hi> Death began from <hi>Adam,</hi> God made
him upright and in Innocency; Death reigned from
his Fall and Tranſgreſſion, when he tranſgreſſed the
Commandment of the Lord. So now I deſire you well
to ponder and conſider this great and weighty Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Holy Scripture, who theſe are that are
capable to praiſe God for his Mercies, Deliverances
and Preſervations. Thoſe that he hath made alive,
and quickened, thoſe that can ſay from true Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<hi>The Lord liveth,</hi> and can call him their Rock,
and can ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Bleſſed be my Rock:
and let the God of my ſalvation be exalted.</hi> And as he
ſpeaks in the beginning of this Pſalm,<note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 2.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord is my
Rock, and my Fortreſs, and my Deliverer: my God, my
ſtrength, in whom I will truſt, my Buckler, the horn of
my Salvation and my high Towre. I will call upon the
Lord, who is worthy to be praiſed: ſo ſhall I be ſaved
from mine Enemies.</hi> And the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place,<note place="margin">Pſal. 147. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord: for it is good to ſing
praiſes our God; for it is pleaſant, and praiſe is
comely. Praiſe is comely for the Righteous.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 33. 1.</note> It is as a
beautiful and comely Garment; it is an Ornament
to them; but it is as improper for the Unrighteous
and for Wicked and Ungodly Perſons, as it is to take
a Dead Carcaſe full of Stench and Corruption, and
cloth it with a rich and beautiful Garment, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
and uncomely is Praiſe and Thankſgiving in
the Mouth of a Wicked and ungodly Perſon. The
Scripture gives no Allowance to ſuch as are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unfit, to Rejoyce and Praiſe the Lord; they are
called to mourn and weep, and to be humbled for their
Sins. But ſome may object and ſay, Is it not an
univerſal Duty of all Men to praiſe the Lord? Yes
if they will forſake their Sins, and turn to the Lord;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45873:4"/>
as the Prophet ſpeaks,<note place="margin">Iſa. 55. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way,
and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return
unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to
our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> Then the Lord
will accept of a Sacrifice of Praiſe,<note place="margin">Iſa. 1. 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>Waſh ye, make you
clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine
eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, ſeek judgment,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord: though
your ſins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow;
though they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wooll.</hi>
Then he will allow them to come into his preſence
and to ſpeak unto him, and to offer him praiſe for his
Mercies.</p>
            <p>Now there is this thing further that I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to your ſerious Conſideration. Look through
the whole Scripture and you ſhall find, it hath
been the manner and way of Gods People to praiſe
him, not only in general, daily and conſtantly for his
Mercies, Favours, Preſervations and Deliverances, but
upon every <hi>New Occaſion</hi> upon the receiving of any
Extraordinary Mercies, Bleſſings, Preſervations, or
Deliverances from Dangers, and from Violence deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and threatned, to Praiſe, and Solemnly bleſs the
Lord, with Cordial Thankſgiving; and we are to
ſet Time apart for this Work, and to excite and ſtir
up our ſelves to magnifie and praiſe the Lord. Thus
Holy <hi>David</hi> excites and ſtirs up himſelf to praiſe the
Lord,<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 156.</note> and prays to the Lord to quicken him, <hi>Great
are thy tender mercies, O Lord: quicken me according to
thy judgments. Many are my perſecutors, and mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
yet do I not decline from thy teſtimonies. Conſider
how I love thy precepts: quicken me O Lord, according to
thy loving kindneſs.</hi> Of this I might give many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
from the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:45873:4"/>
When the Lord brought a Flood to drown the old
World, he ſaid, <hi>I will deſtroy man, whom I have created,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 7.</note>
               <hi>from the face of the earth, both man and beast, and the
creeping thing, and the fowls of the air.</hi> But <hi>Noah</hi> found
grace in the eyes of the Lord, and he commanded
<hi>Noah</hi> to make him an <hi>Ark</hi> for the ſaving himſelf and
his Family; and when he had finiſhed it, the Lord
ſaid unto <hi>Noah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 7. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Come thou and all thy houſe into the
Ark: For thee have I ſeen righteous before me in this
generation;</hi> and that Ark was Inſtrumental for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
him and his Family from the Deluge. We
ſee what benefit <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family received by, and
through him. You that dwell in Families that ſerve
and fear the Lord, there is great benefit and advantage
you may receive thereby; but it is not that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles
you to Eternal Salvation: It is not the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of Parents that will ſave their Children, but
they muſt be changed and renewed in their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:
But there is a great advantage in it for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
and Servants to dwell in a Godly Family; they
enjoy many Spiritual Advantages, and partake of
Temporal Salvation and Deliverances, as it appears
by <hi>Noah</hi>'s Family, who were ſaved in the Ark. After
the Flood <hi>Noah builded an Altar unto the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 8. 20.</note> and in
token of his Thankſgiving, he <hi>took of every clean beaſt,
and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the
Altar. And the Lord ſmelled a ſweet ſavour:</hi> There
was a ſweet ſavour did aſcend to the Lord, it was
the ſavour of his Faith. <hi>And God ſpake unto Noah,
and to his ſons with him, ſaying, And I, behold, I eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
my Covenant with you, and with your ſeed after you;
And I will eſtabliſh my Covenant with you, neither ſhall
all fleſh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall there any more be a flood to deſtroy the earth.</hi> I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45873:5"/>
ſhall give ſome further Inſtances of this great Truth,
of offering Praiſe and Thankſgiving to the Lord for
Mercies and Deliverances. Conſider that great and
wonderful Deliverance that God gave to the Children
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when he brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> through
the Red Sea,<note place="margin">Pſal. 106. 9, 10.</note> as upon dry Land, <hi>He rebuked the Red
Sea alſo, and it was dried up: ſo he led them through the
depths as through the wilderneſs. And he ſaved them
from the hand of him that hated them: and redeemed
them from the hand of the enemy. And the waters cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their enemies: there was not one of them left. Then
believed they his words, they ſang his praiſe.</hi> You have
the words of Thankſgiving ſet down:<note place="margin">Exod. 15. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Then ſang Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and the children of Iſrael this ſong unto the Lord, I
will ſing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriouſly;
the horſe and the rider hath he thrown into the Sea.</hi> We
have many Inſtances of this Duty of praiſing God in
the Book of <hi>Pſalms,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 126.</note> 
               <hi>When the Lord turned again the
captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. Then
was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with
ſinging: then ſaid they among the heathen, the Lord hath
done great things for them. The Lord hath done great
things for us: whereof we are glad.</hi> And the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>
tells us,<note place="margin">Pſal. 137. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>By the rivers of Babylon, there we ſat down,
yea we wept, when we remembred Zion. We hanged our
harps upon the willows in the midſt thereof. For there they
that carried us away captive, required of us a ſong; and
they that waſted us, required of us mirth, ſaying, Sing
us one of the Songs of Zion. How ſhall we ſing the Lords
ſong in a ſtrange land?</hi> But when they came back to

               <hi>as it were a ſea of glaſs, mingled with fire;

and them that had gotten the victory over the beaſt, and over
his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his
name, ſtanding on the ſea of glaſs, having the harps of
God. And they ſang the ſong of Moſes the ſervant of

ſung the Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Song of the <hi>Lamb?</hi>
I hope this is in part already fulfilled, and it will be
more abundantly fulfilled, when the Lord ſhall be
pleaſed to raiſe up many, and make them Living
Witneſſes of this Victory over the Beaſt, and over his

that mind to ſlight and undervalue what God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

brought to paſs, and will be more and more brought
to paſs and accompliſhed, the great Work of God, in
raiſing up Men with a Noble and Undaunted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and great Reſolution, with their Lives in their
Hands; for many have laid down their Lives to give a
faithful Teſtimony of the Truth, and have ſealed it
with their Blood above One hundred and thirty Years
ago: The Work of God is to be owned, the Arm of
God was made bare, and his Mighty Hand made known
therein: This which hath been done is a great prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for what is to follow: He that made not the World
at once, but by degrees, as in the ſpace of ſix days:
God that <hi>was before <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

God could (if he pleas'd) form the Child in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Womb in one day, or in a moment, yet he doth
it gradually, in the ſpace of ten Months; God could
make a Corn or Grain of Wheat to grow up in a

Errors and Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are
ſuch, that ſhe may well be called the Mother of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots,
and Abominations of the Earth; She hath her
Daughters, that tho they profeſs to be different from
her, yet they are too much of her Spirit. All that
Worſhip Idols of Gold and Silver, VVood and Stone;
And likewiſe thoſe that, although they do not Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
Images, yet if they love Money more than God,
they are guilty of Idolatry, and will be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
her Daughters at the great Day of Account:
As alſo, all Perſecuters and falſe Worſhipers. It was
a mighty Work of God that hath broken the Ice in

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45873:6"/>
paſs, and is yet further to be carried on till it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated

and Revelation that God made to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<hi>John,</hi> who by the Light of Prophecy foreſaw
things to come, many Hundred Years before they

great red dragon, having ſeven heads, and ten horns, and
ſeven crowns upon his heads. And the Dragon stood before
the woman that was ready to be delivered for to devour her
child as ſoon as it was born. And ſhe brought forth a man
child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and
her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne. And
the woman fled into the Wilderneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the dragon
was worth with the woman, and went to make war with

               <hi>And after theſe things,</hi> ſaith
the Apoſtle, <hi>I heard a great voice of much people in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
ſaying, Alleluja, Salvation, and Glory, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and Power unto the Lord our God: For true and
righteous are his Judgments, for he hath judged the great
whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication,
and hath avenged the blood of his ſervants at her hand.
And the four and twenty elders, and the four living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45873:7"/>
fell down and worſhiped God that ſat on the throne,
ſaying,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 5. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>Amen; Alleluja. And the four living creatures,
and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb,
having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of
odours, which are the prayers of the ſaints. And they ſang
a new ſong, ſaying, Thou waſt ſlain, and hast redeemed us
to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue,
and people, and nation. And every creature which is in
heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and ſuch
as are in the ſea, and all that are in them, heard I, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Bleſſing, and Honour, and Glory, and Power be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him that ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for

out of the Holy Scripture, that it hath been
the Work of Gods people to praiſe God for all his
Mercies, Bleſſings and Deliverances, and this is that
which God expects from us that we ſhould Magnifie
and praiſe him when he is pleaſed to work great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances

               <hi>Offer unto God thanksgiving, and pay thy vows

This is the juſt Tribute that God requires who is the
Great Deliverer and Preſerver of Men, to glorifie and
praiſe him, and give him that honour that is due to
his Great and Excellent Name, and not only to praiſe
him with our Tongues and Lips, but with our Lives;

<hi>and to him that ordereth his converſation aright, will I
ſhew the ſalvation of God.</hi> And our Saviour command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
this, and chargeth it upon us as our duty. <hi>Let

               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note>

as concerning the praiſes of God; all Gods praiſes

which are acceptable to him, they are to be in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him.</hi> The praiſes of God
are of a higher and lower degree. We find there are
in the Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> Songs of degrees, ſo there are
the high Praiſes of God, when the Soul is raiſed up by
Gods Power and Spirit from a deep and profound
ſenſe of his Mercies and great Deliverances to render
Thankſgiving and Praiſe. <hi>For thou haſt delivered my

               <hi>mine eyes from tears, and my feet from

My meditation of him ſhall be ſweet: I will be glad in the

Praiſes of God, theſe words are going before; <hi>Let the
ſinners be conſumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be
no more: bleſs thou the Lord, O my ſoul, Praiſe ye the
Lord.</hi> When the high Praiſes of the Lord are to be
in our Mouths, then all evil thoughts, and wicked
imaginations, and ſinful motions, ſuch as hinder Gods.
Praiſes, are to be put far from us, that we may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

               <hi>O give thanks unto the Lord; call

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45873:8"/>
Truth, that upon receipt of great Mercies do render
praiſes to God. If real gratitude be in our Hearts
and the high Praiſes of God in our mouths, this is a
token for good; it is like the white ſtone and new
name, which none know but them that have it. It
is a great folly in many Men that will argue ſo much
about Perfection, as if they had attained to Perfection,
and were already perfect, when it may be they know
little of it, or are ſcarce advanced a few ſteps towards
it. It is as if a Child of three or four Years old
ſhould diſpute and quarrel about the Perfection of a
Man come to a full age, and about the Wiſdom
and Strength of ſuch a one; as an Infant under age is
not in a capacity to underſtand theſe things, no more
can many that talk ſo much of Perfection judge of
the experiences of grown and eminent Chriſtians.
The Apoſtle ſaith concerning ſuch,<note place="margin">1 John 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>I have written
unto you, young men, becauſe ye are strong, and the word
of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked
one.</hi> VVe cannot attain to this high degree of praiſing
the Lord with a perfect heart, and a raiſed and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
mind as becomes thoſe that ſing the high Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of God, till the body of Sin in a great meaſure
be deſtroyed, mortified and crucified in us, that Sin
may not have dominion, but that as Sin hath reigned
unto Death, even ſo might Grace reign through
Righteouſneſs unto Eternal Life by Jeſus Chriſt our
Lord. The motions of Sin in the Fleſh, are like a
Rebel in a Country well governed: There may be
ſome Rebels in a Princes Country that is well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned,
and they may ſeek to do miſchief, ſo it is
with ſome in whom a good work is begun; he hath a
Law in his Members, that wars againſt the Law of
his Mind, to bring him into Captivity to the Law
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45873:8"/>
of Sin, yet there is in him ſomething that is good,
ſo that the Reign and Government of Sin is oppoſed
and reſiſted, and Sin hath not Dominion over him.
It is a good and bleſſed State a Man is in, when he
reſiſts and ſtrives againſt Sin to get the Blood of Sin;
he will reſiſt Sin unto Blood to get the Blood of Sin,
<hi>Ye have not yet reſiſted unto blood</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle)
<hi>ſtriving againſt ſin.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12. 4.</note> There have been thoſe that have
reſiſted unto Blood, not to ſhed the Blood of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
but have laid down their Lives in the Cauſe of
God, and have Sealed their Teſtimony with their
own Blood, and have witneſſed againſt Popery, and
the damnable Hereſies of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> with
the expence of their own Blood. VVe have cauſe to
bleſs God for thoſe that are gone before us that have
broke the Ice and prepared our way for us. VVe
have cauſe to bleſs the Lord that hath the hearts of Kings
in his hands and turneth them as the Rivers of VVater.
Bleſſed be God that ſo inclined the Heart of the King
and thoſe in Authority, that all in this Nation and all
the three Nations that are Sober and Godly and of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Conſciences may enjoy the happy Freedom and
Liberty to ſerve and VVorſhip God according to
their Faith and Perſwaſion. This is that, God hath
graciouſly vouchſafed to us which is a Marvellous and
Signal Mercy never to be forgotten. O how would
we have prized this Mercy and Liberty ſome Years
ſince, when we could not meet and aſſemble together
without great hazard and ſuffering, when many were
haled to Priſon, and many knocked down, and had
their Blood ſhed when they came together for the
VVorſhip of God. O that we could truly apply to
our ſelves the Words of Holy <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 18, 17, 19.</note> and ſay, <hi>The
Lord delivered us becauſe he delighted in us: He deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45873:9"/>
me from my ſtrong enemy, and from them which hated
me: for they were too ſtrong for me. He brough me forth
alſo into a large place: he delivered me, becauſe he delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in me.</hi> O that we could ſay, that God hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the KING, and the whole Nation becauſe
he delighted in us, and hath taken pleaſure in us. It
may be ſaid ſo concerning ſome, I would to the Lord,
it might be ſo ſaid concerning many among us. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
ſaith further in the following words, <hi>The Lord
rewarded me according to my righteouſneſs, according to
the cleanneſs of my hands hath he recompenſed me. For
I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly
departed from my God. I was alſo upright before him:
and I kept my ſelf from mine iniquity.</hi> This is a very
high ſtrain of <hi>David,</hi> he mentions his Innocency
with reſpect to <hi>Saul;</hi> we have it thus expreſſed in the
title of the Pſalm; <hi>David</hi> the Servant of the Lord
ſpake unto the Lord the words of this Song, in the
day that the Lord delivered him from the hand of all
his Enemies, and from the hand of <hi>Saul. David</hi> was
proclaimed by <hi>Saul</hi> a Traytor and a Rebel. Poor <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
Little <hi>David,</hi> when he was a Shepherd, little
thought that he ſhould be the King of that great
Kingdom; and after he was anointed King he did not
conſpire againſt <hi>Saul,</hi> that purſued him for his Life
as a Rebel, but <hi>David</hi> was innocent with reference to
him; therefore he ſaith, <hi>The Lord rewarded me accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to my righteouſneſs, and according to the cleanneſs
of my hands hath he recompenſed me.</hi> This is not to be
underſtood, as if <hi>David</hi> relied upon his own Works
or Merits, but he had a Teſtimony in his own heart,
and the Lords Spirit bare him witneſs, that he was
Innocent with reſpect to <hi>Saul,</hi> and the Lord account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him Innocent, he ſuffered for his ſake. The Lord
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45873:9"/>
choſe him to be King, without any Plotting or Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and <hi>David</hi> was tender of <hi>Saul,</hi> he did not take
the opportunity to ſlay <hi>Saul</hi> when ſome would have
perſwaded him. But then there is an obſervable word
which <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks,<note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 23.</note> 
               <hi>I was alſo upright before him, and
I kept my ſelf from mine Iniquity.</hi> A ſtrange word may
ſome ſay; How did he keep himſelf from his <hi>Iniquity?</hi>
The opening of this may be of uſe and ſervice to ſome
here: It is thus to be underſtood; <hi>David</hi> tho he was a
good Man, yet he did find, and was conſcious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that there was a Principle of Iniquity which lay
very near to him, to tempt him to Sin, and to ſome
particular Sin more than to others, which he calls <hi>mine
Iniquity;</hi> he was not ſo careful and watchful afterwards,
when he came to be ſettled in the Kingdom. He was
not ſo watchful over his Heart, as to keep himſelf from
that principle of Luſt that was remaining in him; you
know what appeared and brake out in the caſe of <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba;</hi>
he walked upon the top of his Palace, and was
gazing abroad, he was not upon his Guard, did not
keep his Watch, and his Iniquity got Victory over
him; but before this happened, when he was vigilant
and jealous over himſelf with a godly Jealouſie, he
could ſay, <hi>I have kept my ſelf from mine Iniquity;</hi> this
Expreſſion declares to us thus much, that he had ſome
particular Sin that he had need to watch againſt; he
had ſome particular Enemy near to him according to
thoſe words of our Bleſſed Lord, <hi>A Man's greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are thoſe of his own houſe:</hi> So it was in this caſe,
<hi>David's</hi> worſt Enemies were thoſe of his own Houſe,
he did not watch and keep his guard againſt them in
the time of his Proſperity, when he was advanced to
the Crown and Scepter of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and his
Enemies ſubdued under him; after God had delivered
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45873:10"/>
him from the Hands of all his Enemies, he ſhould have
kept himſelf from his <hi>Iniquity,</hi> as he had done former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when <hi>Saul</hi> hunted and purſued him as a <hi>Partridge</hi>
upon the Mountains. Men and Women commonly
have ſome particular Sin and Luſt, which in a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
manner they may call their own <hi>Iniquity.</hi> It is Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs
and the love of Carnal Pleaſure in ſome,
Ambition and Pride in others; and Envy and Malice
in ſome and Covetouſneſs (which is Idolatry) in
others. Therefore let not Men Flatter and Deceive
themſelves, and think that there is nothing of the Seed
and Principle of Sin remaining in their Fleſh. I have
heard of the Saying of a choice Chriſtian a worthy
Woman, <hi>ſhe had long experienced a bleſſed State of near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to God:</hi> I have heard a Perſon ſay (that had it from
her own Mouth) that for the ſpace of ſome Years, the
Grace of God did ſhine in her as the Sun at Noon-Day.
It was a conſtant thing with her to walk with God the
whole Day, from her riſing up to her lying down,
and ſhe enjoyed a lively ſenſe of the Love of God, and
the Conſolations of his Holy Spirit: But it pleaſed the
Lord afterwards to hide his Face, and then ſhe was
troubled, yet God did not utterly leave her, for ſhe
Died a good Chriſtian: But He did withdraw and
with-held from her thoſe ſenſible Joys and Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſhe had raſted and felt in Communion with Him;
ſome have heard her ſay, <hi>When it was ſo with me, that
the Light of God's Countenance was lifted up upon me, and
he had put gladneſs into my Heart, I thought there was no
Sin had any place or room in me; but after thoſe refreſhing
Joys and ſenſible Conſolations were removed, and the Lord
did hide his Face from me, who hath promiſed he will not
utterly forſake his People, whoſe Faithfulneſs doth engage
him never finally to leave them, tho' for ſome time he may
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45873:10"/>
ſeem to Deſert them; when I had</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>thoſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Joys and refreſhings from the preſence of the Lord, I
thought Sin had been quite gone, but afterward I found it
was but driven into a corner.</hi> Many that think they
are come to high Attainments,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 18.</note> may ſay, <hi>For I know
that in me (that is in my fleſh) dwelleth no good thing. O
wretched Creature that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the
body of this death! I thank God, through Jeſus Chriſt our
Lord. So then with the mind I my ſelf ſerve the law of God;
but with the fleſh the law of ſin.</hi> The Work that God
hath appointed to every Chriſtian is like the work of
a Gardener Dreſſing his Garden, we are ſo to manage
our Hearts, and order our Converſations, and Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
our ſelves, that we may be as a Watered Garden
to the Lord. A Dreſſer of a Garden muſt take great
pains, and labour hard to make it Fruitful; if he doth
not diligently and conſtantly employ himſelf, Weeds
will be ſpringing up, and hinder the growth of the
Herbs and Flowers; therefore the Gardener muſt lay
his Hands to it, and pluck up the noxious Weeds that
they may not ſpread and ſpoil and overrun the Garden.
So we muſt labour and take pains with our Hearts and
Souls. I remember it was a ſaying of <hi>Bernard</hi> in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which he wrote to ſome of his Friends, <hi>Let your Soul
be continually in your Hands,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 109.</note> as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>my ſoul is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
in my hands,</hi> that is, in a way of reliance and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it up into the Hands of the Lord. But <hi>Bernard,</hi>
when he ſaith, <hi>Let your Soul be continually in your Hands,</hi>
he means thus, Let your Soul be continually waſhing
and cleanſing every Day more and more, that you may
be purified and kept unſpotted from the World. If we
have a ſpot or ſpeck upon a Garment, we will take
pains to rubit out. And thus it ought to be with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of us; let our Souls be continually in our Hands,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45873:11"/>
let us be dreſſing our Hearts continually, and keep
them with all keeping; keep them with all Diligence,
for out of them are the Iſſues of Life; keep your Hearts
with all keeping, and our Lord Chriſt will refreſh you
with his Living Water, as he told the Woman of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,
Whoſoever drinketh of the Water that I ſhall give him,
ſhall never thirst; but the Water that I ſhall give him,
ſhall be in him a well of Water ſpringing up unto everlaſting
Life.</hi> There is a great Myſtery in this; God for Chriſt's
ſake, and through Chriſt Jeſus hath placed in us an
inward principle of Divine Life. We are oft refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Streams of this Living Spring that flows
within us, reviving us with the ſenſe of the Love of
God; What is it that oft hinders this Well from ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up in us, but the dirt and rubbiſh of Sin? The <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines</hi>
ſtopped the VVells that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
had Digged, but they unſtopped them again that
the VVaters might ſpring up. Let us keep our Hearts
clear from the dirt and rubbiſh of Sin, that this VVell
may ſpring up in us to Everlaſting Life. VVhen our
Saviour was demanded of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> when the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God ſhould come? He anſwer'd them, and ſaid,
<hi>The Kingdom of God cometh not with obſervation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 17. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall ye ſay, Lo here, or lo there: for behold, the
kingdom of God is within you.</hi> Yet they were bad Men
and Hypocrites. It was in them as a very little Seed,
it was in them as if it were not in them; as the Man
that had one Talent, he had it as if he had it not, he
did no good with it; our Lord called him wicked and
ſlothful Servant,<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 13.</note> and ſaid, <hi>Take therefore the Talent from
him, and give it unto him which had ten talents. For unto
every one that hath ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance:
but from him that hath not ſhall be taken away, even
that which he hath.</hi> A Covetous Man wants what he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45873:11"/>
hath, as if he had it not. Chriſt Jeſus is the true Light
that lighteth every Man that cometh into the World.
I diſſent from them that ſpeak ſlightly of that Light
which reproves Sin in the Conſciences of Men and
Women, God hath put his Law in Mens Hearts, and
as the Great Law-giver he hath written it there with
his own Finger, <hi>and the Gentiles that have not the Law,
are a Law to themſelves,</hi> for if God had not writ his
Law in all Mens Hearts they would have no ſin, where
no Law is there is no Tranſgreſſion. God alſo writes
his Laws in the Hearts of true Believers and ſoftens
their Hearts to take the impreſſion of it; but every
Unbeliever and unconverted Man and Woman hath a
Heart of Stone. None but thoſe which know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be of the New Creation of God, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of a Heart of Fleſh given them, and a Heart
of Stone taken away. It is they only that have the
Law written upon the fleſhly Tables of their Hearts,
that are waſhed and purified; though I cannot ſay,
there is a Well of Living Water in any that do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
yet there is ſomething placed by God in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one towards it, like the Miniſtry of <hi>John</hi> the
<hi>Baptiſt</hi> which was <hi>a preparing the way of the Lord,</hi> he was
ſpoken of by the Prophet <hi>Iſaias ſaying,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 3.</note> 
               <hi>the voice of one
crying in the wilderneſs, prepare ye the way of the Lord, make
his paths straight.</hi> Our Saviour ſaid to the Woman
of <hi>Samaria, if thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is
that ſaith unto thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have
asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</hi>
And in another place it is ſaid,<note place="margin">John 7. 37. 38.</note> 
               <hi>In the laſt day, that great
day of the feast, Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying, if any man
thirſt, let him come unto me, and drinke. He that believeth
on me, as the ſcripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow
rivers of living water; but this he ſpake of the ſpirit, which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45873:12"/>
that believe on him ſhould receive;</hi> not Unbelievers: You
that ſincerely and truly Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
without all peradventure you have ſomething of this
Well of Living Water within you, you have the gift
of God, O give thanks to God through Jeſus Chriſt our
Lord for this great and unſpeakable Gift! Some may ſay,
if I have a Well of Living Water in me, what is the reaſon
I feel ſo little comfort? my ſoul thirſt, and I want this
Living water to drink, O that I had ſome drops of it to
cool and quench my thirſty Soul. I Anſwer, Thou doſt
not diligently watch thy Heart; thou ſuffereſt thy
Sins, thoſe <hi>Philistins</hi> to prevail over thee, and ſtop
up thy Well. When <hi>Abimelech</hi>'s Servants had ſtopped
the Wells which were digged in the days of <hi>Abraham,
Iſaac</hi> digged them again;<note place="margin">Gen. 26. 18.</note> I ſay unto you throw away
the Rubbiſh, and Earth, and Dirt, that is got into
your own Hearts, and every thing that the Light in
your own Conſciences tells you in evil, and then the
Waters will ſpring forth. Then you will experience
a Well of Living Water ſpringing up in you unto
Everlaſting Life. The Prophets of Old, <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Samuel, Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and all other
Holy Men of God, they had experience of this Well
within them ſpringing up unto Everlaſting Life, and
all true Believers before Chriſt came in the Fleſh, they
<hi>did all eat the ſame ſpiritual meat;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and drink the ſame ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
drink: (For they drank of that ſpiritual Rock that
followed them: and that Rock was Christ)</hi> and they had
all thoſe Spiritual Bleſſings we enjoy upon the account
of Chriſt, his moſt Holy Obedience and Death: There
was this difference between us and them. We believe
in Chriſt that is already come, and they ſaw Chriſt
in the Promiſes, and in Shadows, Types and Figures,
and believed in Chriſt that was to come Under the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45873:12"/>
Law they were under a Yoke of Bondage; but
we have cauſe to bleſs the Lord, that hath taken that
Yoke from off our Necks, that neither they nor their
Fathers were able to bear. We Read in <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 5.<note place="margin">Acts 15. 5, 6, 7, 8.</note>
               <hi>There roſe up certain of the ſect of the Phariſees, which
believed, ſaying. That it was needful to circumciſe them,
and to command them to keep the law of Moſes. And the
apoſtles and elders came together for to conſider of this
matter. And when there had been much diſputing, Peter roſe
up and ſaid unto them, Men and Brethren, ye know how that
a good while a go, God made choice among us, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
by my mouth ſhould hear the word of the Goſpel, and
believe. And God which knoweth the hearts, bear them wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
giving them the holy Ghoſt, even as he did unto us:
And put no difference between us and them, purifying their
hearts by faith. Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put
a yoke upon the neck of the diſciples, which neither our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
nor we were able to bear? But we believe that
through the grace of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhall be ſaved
even as they.</hi> Bleſſed be God, that hath delivered us
from that burden of Ceremonies and multitudes of
Rites and Obſervations, that were continued till the
clearer times of the Goſpel, when all the Males before
that time went every Year up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip,
which was many Miles diſtant from many of their
Habitations: The Lord hath been pleaſed to make
the Chriſtian Service under the Goſpel much more
eaſie to us upon an outward account, and likewiſe
more advantagious as well as more eaſie and Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
upon a Spiritual Account: God hath given us
more of his Spirit in theſe times of the Goſpel, not that
God hath given us a greater Meaſure of his Holy
Spirit than he gave unto the Prophets (for they had
greater gifts of the Spirit) but there is now generally
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45873:13"/>
given more abundant meaſures of the Spirit to Gods
Poople under this Diſpenſation of the Goſpel; there
were then in general but lower and leſſer Meaſures,
and as it were ſome droppings of the Spirit upon them
that lived in former Ages, but in the latter days after
Chriſts aſcenſion there hath been the powring out of
the Spirit,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 7.</note> that (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>God might in
ages to come ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace in his
kindneſs towards us, through Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And if any
do not now witneſs the powring forth of the Spirit,
they may find the cauſe in themſelves, they are not
careful and diligent to improve the Means and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
that God hath given to them, and that is
the reaſon of it. In the cloſe of the 18th <hi>Pſalm, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
ſpeaks ſome things concerning himſelf, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things relating to Chriſt, ſpeaking of himſelf, as
he was a <hi>Type of Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 43. 44.</note> 
               <hi>Thou haſt delivered me from the
ſtrivings of the people: and thou haſt made me the head of
the heathen: a people whom I have not known ſhall ſerve
me. Aſſoon as they hear of me, they ſhall obey me: the
ſtrangers ſhall ſubmit themſelves to me.</hi> This was
but little fulfilled in <hi>David</hi> the <hi>Type,</hi> but was largely
fulfilled many hundred years after in <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type.</hi>
VVhen the Apoſtles came to Preach Chriſt Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
then very many that heard believed in Chriſt,
and obeyed him, ſubmitted themſelves to him, and
many afterwards laid down their Lives for him. My
Friends, ought not we be very Thankful when we
conſider and call to mind what a ſad condition <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
was in many Hundred Years ago, when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
worſhipped <hi>Diana,</hi> and other Idols and
falſe Gods? <hi>Jerom</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Britains</hi> were ſo Savage
and Barbarous, that they did eat Mans Fleſh. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be God for his abundant mercy and kindneſs to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45873:13"/>
us that hath brought many in this Nation to the
true Knowledge of God and his Son Jeſus Chriſt,
which is Life Eternal. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> concludes the
<hi>Pſalm</hi> I have been mentioning with theſe words,<note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 50.</note>
               <hi>Great deliverance giveth he to his King: and ſheweth
mercy to his annointed, to David, and to his ſeed for
evermore. David</hi> (as a <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) ſtiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Gods King, none are to be called Gods Kings e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
and in all reſpects as <hi>David</hi> was, thus he brings
in God ſpeaking in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 2. 6. of Chriſt. <hi>Yet have I
ſet my King upon my holy hill of Zion. Ask of me, and
I ſhall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and
the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> Great
deliverance hath he given to his King; <hi>David</hi> was
called Gods King in a peculiar ſenſe as a <hi>Type</hi> of <hi>Chriſt:</hi>
I know no King in the VVorld, that in all reſpects
may equal himſelf with <hi>David.</hi> God ſent the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Samuel</hi> to anoint him King when he was keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sheep;<note place="margin">1 Sam. 16. 12.</note> he was the leaſt and loweſt of all his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
but <hi>he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and goodly to look to. Samuel</hi> Anointed him in
the midſt of his Brethren, <hi>and the ſpirit of the Lord came
upon David from that day forward;</hi> and afterward the
People choſe him to be King. It is my Belief and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,
that there have been, and may be Kings in the
World that may be ſaid to be God's Kings. God hath
raiſed up ſome for ſome ſingular and eminent Work,
ſo God raiſed up <hi>Cyrus</hi> and ſtiled him his <hi>Anointed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 44. 28.</note>

               <hi>I have raiſed him up in righteouſneſs,</hi>
(ſaith the Lord) <hi>and I will direct all his ways: he ſhall
build my city, and he ſhall let go my captives, not for price
not reward, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> Whatſoever King or
Prince God hath raiſed up, it ſhould be our earneſt
Deſire and Prayer, That the work of the Lord may
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45873:14"/>
Proſper in their Hands. And let me tell you this
Day here is matter for high Praiſes and Thankſgiving,
that God hath graciouſly and wonderfully Saved and
Delivered the King from the Hands of bloody Men
that deſigned his Deſtruction, and the Ruin of theſe
Nations: We have abundant cauſe to be Thankful not
only for his Perſonal Deliverance and Preſervation; but
alſo to Pray that God would be pleaſed to make him an
eminent Inſtrument in his Hand to ſerve and glorifie
God in his Generation, and promote the Chriſtian
Faith, and the common Intereſt of all ſincere Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
againſt the Roman Papacy, and barbarous Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and Slavery. I pray God the ſenſe of this great
Mercy and Deliverance may dwell upon all our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
It is not only a Deliverance (as I hinted before)
of the King's own Perſon; but of us, our Wives and
little Ones, our Cities, Towns, and Families: If this
Deſign had proſpered and anſwered the expectation
of our Enemies, what Ruin and Confuſion would it
have brought upon theſe Nations! What could we
have expected in this Great and Populous City, but
Deſolation and Ruin throughout the whole Iſland.
I ſpeak in ſincerity, I feel joy to ariſe in my Heart,
and ſuch a ſenſe of this Mercy, as doth excite me to
Praiſe and Thankſgiving, and to magnifie the Name
of the Lord that hath done great Things for us; if
therebe any that flatteringly and hypocritically Praiſe
God for this National Mercy, they have their reward.
Let us all therefore Sincerely Cordially and in
good ear-neſt expreſs our Thankfulneſs to God for
that great Salvation he hath wrought for the
King and theſe Kingdoms. It is a ſignal Mercy and
Univerſal Bleſſing. Let us all excite and provoke one
another to be truly Thankful to God, not only with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45873:14"/>
our Lips but with our Lives, not only verbally but
really in a Chriſtian Life and Converſation; without
which our keeping a Day of Thankſgiving will not
be acceptable to the Lord. For thus ſaith the Lord,
<hi>Whoſo offereth praiſe, glorifieth me: and to him that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
his converſation aright,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 23.</note>

            <p>AS We do ſincerely believe and profeſs,
that Magiſtracy and Government in the
World is an Ordinance of God; and that it is
the Duty of all Men to be ſubject to thoſe in
Authority whom God hath placed over them,
ſo moſt eſpecially, that it is the Duty of all
Chriſtians to be eminently exemplary to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in giving and demonſtrating all due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the Government and Authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

for Conſcience ſake; and that they ought to
pray for them, and give thanks to God for the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45873:15"/>
Bleſſings and Benefits received by them and their
Government; and for this cauſe Tribute is due
unto them to ſupport and maintain them in the
neceſſary diſcharge thereof: And in behalf of
our ſelves and other Chriſtian People, who are
of one Faith and Perſwaſion with us, as true
and ſincere Chriſtians and Proteſtants, ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Mercy hath in general brought into theſe Three
Nations, as well as to other Proteſtant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
againſt the Uſurpation of the Papal Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy.
By this our preſent Teſtimony we do
ſincerely and ſolemnly declare, that we hold it
