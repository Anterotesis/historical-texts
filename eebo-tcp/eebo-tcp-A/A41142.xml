            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, then why doſt thou not ſee thy caſe to be <hi>damnable</hi>? Doſt thou not know that judgement is paſt upon all to damnation? <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>all men are damned out of Chriſt.</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not <hi>a new creature, is not in Christ,</hi> but is a damn'd man to this day; thou knoweſt the Lord himſelfe doth ſay thus; what hinders thee now from deducting a particular there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from?

I am a damned man and a damned wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to this day; if thou wouldſt be brought to this paſſe there might be ſome hope of thee, <hi>but thou wilt not,</hi> thou wilt ſcrape up ſome hopes or other, thou wilt not beleeve this. Beleeve thus, <hi>ſayes God</hi>; but I will not ſayſt thou, no, thou wilt have thy luſt ſtill, and thou wilt not beleeve this, if thou wouldſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54043:36"/>
verily thou art a <hi>damned man,</hi> becauſe thou art not <hi>a new creature in Chriſt,</hi> may be thou wouldſt never have done til thou art one, thou wouldſt forſake all and follow <hi>Chriſt in all</hi> things, but thou <hi>wilt not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, but I cannot ſayſt thou; why then wilt thou not <hi>diſpaire in thy ſelfe?</hi> a man muſt deſpaire as he is, otherwiſe hee can never <hi>get into Chriſt</hi>; as long as a man lives and does after the fleſh, hee can have no true hope of mercy or pardon, or any thing; no hee is a <hi>dead man,</hi> all the <hi>Angels of Heaven</hi> cannot help him; if there were a thouſand <hi>Chriſts</hi> he ſhould periſh without them; and why wilt thou not deſpaire in thy ſelfe? Deſpaire? God forbid. I'le never deſpaire while I live, God is more mercifull then ſo, and I hope I neede not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire. <hi>Chriſt dyed for ſinners and I were a foole if I ſhould deſpaire.</hi> Thus thou pleadeſt with God for thy vaine hopes; but why wilt thou? ſayes God, why wilt thou plead with me, thou haſt tranſgreſſed againſt me, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.29. Thou plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt for hopes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lieſt in thy ſinnes, why wilt thou? marke, the will is ſet on it, and thou wilt plead; <hi>thou might deſpaire of thy ſelfe, but thou wilt not,</hi> and therefore thou wilt wilfully periſh.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, but I cannot <hi>pull downe my owne heart,</hi> nor maſter mine one will ſayſt thou; no? Why then canſt thou not goe and <hi>reſigne it to God?</hi> Lord, here is a proud heart, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not humble it; Oh; here is a ſtony heart, I cannot breake it; Lord do thou; here is a rebellious heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

I know Gods anger is very reaſonable, for things which thou canſt not; becauſe once hee gave thee power; but when hee commendeth the meanes, now his anger is very reaſonable. Wee our owne ſelves count this anger very reaſonable in the like caſe; <hi>what will hee not do it?</hi> No not uſe the meanes for to do it? Would not this <hi>anger any body?</hi> Say wee ſo for theſe things ſake <hi>comes the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 5.6. That is for adultery, for fornication, for vaine words, and vaine hopes to be ſaved, for theſe things comes the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience. Hee does not ſay for not being renewed, for not being converted, but for theſe things comes the wrath of God forth. He's angry for that, but his <hi>wrath comes generally forth upon men for theſe things, becauſe they will not uſe the meanes</hi>; They will not give over thoſe ſinnes which are the hinderances to converſion. This is very reaſonable; if a man were not able to do it, there would be ſome ſhew at leaſt of unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe in Gods anger; but there is not any ſhew of unreaſonableneſſe in his anger, when men will not buckle to the <hi>meanes which they may.</hi> When <hi>God</hi> commanded the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to ſubmit and be humbled, they would not; he commanded them at leaſt to uſe <hi>the meanes, to let his people go, and they would not.</hi> You ſhall ſee how the Text ſayes his anger now was

very reaſonable; there is a ſweet phraſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.50. Hee <hi>made a way to his anger</hi>; in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew 'tis hee <hi>weighed a path to his anger.</hi> Hee weigted it in a <hi>ballance</hi>; marke how <hi>reaſonably and proportionably God is angry.</hi> Hee puts his anger and mens ſinnes in a ballance, and weighs out the right meaſure of anger. When a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant forceth a Maſter to be angry whether he will or no, hee cannot complaine his Maſters anger is unreaſonable; hee may go of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands and he will not, he may do this buſines and hee will not; if hee cannot do the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelfe, yet he may uſe the meanes, and he will not. Now his Maſters anger is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, becauſe hee forceth him to be angry; as the <hi>churning of Milke bringeth forth butter, ſo the forcing of wrath bringeth forth ſtrife.</hi> Prov. 30.33. Hee does even charme his Maſters paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and hee forces the ſame, as a charmer forcing the Milke to become Butter, ſo hee forces ones kindneſſe to become anger; and therefore the anger is very reaſonable. So God is very reaſonable in his anger; wilt thou not uſe the meanes to be quickned? Suppoſe thou canſt not <hi>quicken thy ſelfe,</hi> but wilt thou not <hi>ſee about the meanes?</hi> This <hi>churneth the Lords anger,</hi> and his anger is very reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>

                        <hi>4</hi> Argu.</note> 
                     <hi>Gods offer of his Kingdome to the wicked is ſerious</hi>; if they were ſenceleſſe and quite dead, and could do nothing, his offer were not ſerious; ſhould a man offer a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound to a dead carcaſſe, here is a hundred pound for you, if youle take it, i'le give it you.

This offer were not ſerious, becauſe the dead carkaſſe is not able to ſtirre, but is ſenceleſſe. True, in <hi>matter of converſion it ſelfe, a man is as dead as a carkaſſe. Nevertheleſſe hee is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely a dead carkaſſe to all uſe of the meanes</hi>; hee hath the life of nature, and reaſon, and of ſence, and therefore when God offers his <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in the meanes, this offer is ſerious. Turne you at my reproofe, behold I will poore out my ſpirit unto you,</hi> Prov. 1.23. Hee ſpeakes there even of reprobates and all, and hee ſeriouſly offers <hi>them his ſpirit,</hi> and therefore they might have gone about the meanes, but they would not; <hi>vocatio dei eſt ſeria,</hi> as our Divines do all ſay, and therefore the meanes hee appointeth may be uſed.</p>

God reproves Iſrael for <hi>not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Statutes,</hi> ſaying the <hi>Statutes of Omri are kept. Mic.</hi> 6.16. You can obſerve his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, why cannot you ſet about mine? hee

ſets up a Temple, you can go conſtantly to it, why cannot you go conſtantly to mine? The reproofe was very equall. If thou wilt not ſet upon the meanes, thou art moſt equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. I cannot preach ſo often as ſome do, nor be ſo much reſident as ſome are. No? Why wilt thou not give over one of thy two livings then?

Yea, its free and without price: its fit though that this price ſhould be ſet upon the almes, that the proud beggar ſhould chooſe to receive it; if thou wilt not give the price that God hath put into thy hand, thou art worthy to miſſe it; I will give ſo much, and labour ſo much, and pray ſo much, and reforme ſo much. No, no; that will not do, Chriſt will have tother odde penny too; thy <hi>filthy ſpeaking muſt off,</hi> and thy baſe <hi>paſſions</hi> and <hi>old curſes muſt off,</hi> heele have thee ſtoope to all his holy meanes; wouldſt thou have it cheaper? Mine owne children and Saints never had it cheaper.

meditation in their hearts, examination in their conſciences, holy communication in mouthes, none of my Saints had it cheaper. And thou makeſt a mock of them for praying ſo much, and profeſſing ſo much, ſo much hearing, and ſo much gadding after Sermons, &amp;c. Well, well, i'le not bate thee one duty, nor one luſt, nor one carnall deſire, i'le have <hi>thee ſet about all or thou ſhall never have mercy.</hi> Yea, but I cannot finde in my heart to put up this, nor to be abridged of this, and ſhall <hi>Chriſt</hi> and thou part for one <hi>ſingle farthing?</hi> Periſh then, and go and thanke thine <hi>will for it in Hell.

                  <p>Firſt, becauſe <hi>Heaven is an end, and an end can never be gotten without meanes</hi>; the end is eternall life. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.22. <hi>eternall life</hi> is an end, and therefore except the means be all uſed, you can never attaine it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God hath <hi>annexed it to the means</hi>; all Heaven and Earth can never ſeparate them; either uſe all the meanes that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, or elſe hee hath decreed it, yee ſhall never be ſaved.

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Every ſoule muſt give an account be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how hee hath uſed the meaners,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee hath uſed them all yea or no. And according as the account is hee can give, ſo ſhall his judgement be. God hath ſworne this, as I live ſaith the Lord; God hath pawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his owne life upon this, that thus it ſhall be. As <hi>J live ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to mee, and every tongue ſhall confeſse to God, every one of us all ſhall give an accompt unto God,</hi> Rom 14.11.12. every one of us, God will <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt none,</hi> wee muſt all be brought to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt for theſe things; will not thy heart bow to it?

                  <head>Proofes.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Some of the meanes that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed you may do them without labour,</hi> you may do them with eaſe; do but ſay I will, and it is done. What labour is it to ſay, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-keepers ſhall not ſit drinking in my houſe? There is nere an Alehouſe in your Towne, but if they will, may root out diſorders from their houſes, their owne wills do deſtroy them; Its no labour in the World to do this, and will ye not do it? <hi>periſh then and thank your own wils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Some of the meanes that God hath appointed, are eaſier then them</hi>; onely that you would give way to another to do them; may be the <hi>wife</hi> would have prayers in the family if the husband would give way. The <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> would teach you if you would give way; The Lord Jeſus might worke many things in you, if you would give way; this <hi>a leſſe then to will.</hi> You that have good Wives, who would reforme ſundry things if you would give way, &amp;c. I beſeech you apply it particularly to yourſelves, your ruin is wilfull if ye yeild not, and will not give way.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Some of the meanes are yet eaſier,</hi> for ſome of the meanes of grace are better for you, even in <hi>your worldly and carnall reſpects.</hi> You'l ſay, that's the eaſieſt of all for a man to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54043:52"/>
himſelfe, and his fleſh. As for example the reforming of your gaming, dicing, card<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your Innes, your drunkenneſſe and bezeling o're the pot, your pride and your gei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gawes, and the like; would not this favour your purſes, and be more agreeable to your very carnall reſpects? And therefore you that do <hi>not reforme theſe,</hi> you <hi>pluck wilfull</hi> perdition on your heads.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, ſome of the <hi>meanes of grace, its harder to omit them then to uſe them.</hi> Many of you meet with more hardſhips in the omiſſion then you could light upon in the practice of them; I need not inſtance, the particulars are very familiar.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Some of the meanes of grace, be they hard, yet they are but hard; they are not impoſſible for you to uſe</hi>; They will aske no more then a litlle labour and diligence, and therefore omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only by reaſon of <hi>will-nots.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I hope by this time you ſee clearely the truth of this ground. <hi>If yee will not ſet your ſelves to uſe the meanes of grace and ſalvation, when yee die, you muſt needs lay the blame on your wills</hi>; And why will yee ſo? <hi>Why will yee die O houſe of Iſrael?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding the evidence of this truth; <hi>The wiſdome of the fleſh which is enmity againſt God,</hi> fills carnall mindes with many <hi>objections</hi> againſt it; from all which I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to vindicate it, by anſwering them all in order.</p>

This is no reaſon why thou ſhouldſt murmur or cavill, or be ſtubborne as thou art, thou canſt not come at Chriſt exeept the father take pity on thee to draw thee. Thou haſt ſo much the more reaſon to be humbled, and not to go on wittingly and willfully as thou doeſt. Canſt thou not be holy, and ſaved, except he be pleaſed to pitty thee? in what a wofull caſe then art thou to provoke him as thou doſt? So much ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the firſt Objection, drawne out of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond thing thou objecteſt, is thy willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; thou wouldeſt as thou pretendeſt, but thou canſt not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer thee for this.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, may be its the <hi>will</hi> of thy <hi>conſcience,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>2.</hi> Object. anſwered</note> and not the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>thy heart</hi>; thy heart is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and unacquainted with God, and ſo its contented to be, only thy conſcience would have thee grow better and more heavenly; but thy heart will not yeeld; and therefore all thy <hi>willings</hi> are nothings but <hi>deludings</hi>; they are only the willings of conſcience and not of thy heart. Thou art chaſing and fretting every foot, thy conſcience tells thee thou ſhouldſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54043:56"/>
not, thou art praying carnally every day; when thou haſt done, conſcience ſayes thou ſhouldſt pray holyer then ſo; <hi>conſcience would, but thou wilt not,</hi> conſcience would have thee get aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance for Heaven, but thou wilt not be at the paines. Alas, this makes thee inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, for now thou <hi>condemneſt thy ſelfe,</hi> and <hi>yet wilt ſinne</hi>; thou art inexcuſable O man who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou art that judgeſt, for <hi>wherein thou judgeſt another, thou condemneſt thy ſelfe.

(I do not now quote it for the particular the Apoſtle does inſtance in there for judging another,) for the truth is the ſame, whatſoever ſinne we do inſtance in, the truth is this that <hi>Paul</hi> grounds his ſpeech on.<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>Hee that condemneth himſelfe in a ſinne, and yet will go on in it; that man is inexcuſable.</hi> What now haſt thou gotten by thy plea? thou wouldſt, thou ſayeſt; this makes thy ſinne to be worſe in that thy conſcience would, and yet for <hi>all that thou wilt not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, may be <hi>its a copulative will</hi>; thou haſt a will to repent and be godly, but it is with a copulative will. <hi>Repentance and ſome luſt, godlineſse and ſome luſt</hi>; thou wouldſt faine pleaſe the Lord and thine own luſt too, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and proud too, believe in Chriſt and covet too, and be vaine too, &amp;c. Thou haſt a will, but it is a copulative will, to ſerve God and do this too; Piſh, cannot I ſerue God and do this too? No, no; <hi>this ſame copulative will is a flat contradiction.</hi> Couple light and darkneſſe? <hi>Chriſt and Beliall,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15. Its a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54043:56"/>
contradiction to imagine to couple them, for they cannot poſſibly be coupled. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſame copulative will is nothing but a <hi>mockery,</hi> and the truth ſtill is this <hi>thou wilt not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, May be thou haſt a <hi>woulding will, this is no will, but onely a velleity</hi>; ſo thou haſt a woulding will. I would do as well as any other but I cannot; to ſpeake properly this is no will, for its onely that will wherewith <hi>fooles</hi> will things <hi>impoſſible</hi>; I would I were at <hi>London,</hi> with a <hi>wiſh</hi> ſayes he; I would I could flie as well as an <hi>Eagle.</hi> Theſe things are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and therefore its no will, but meere folly; thus may be thou willeſt grace, I would with all my heart I could do as God ſayes, <hi>God knowes my heart, my will is good,</hi> I would be better then I am; And yet thy conſcience can call for ſomething or other to be mended, and thou wilt not. This is an impoſſibility,<note place="margin">Lazy vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leities no will.</note> and therefore no will; like the foole that would ſit in his chaire, and I would I were at <hi>London,</hi> he would faine be at <hi>London and ſit ſtill.</hi> So thou ſitteſt at the ſame paſſe, <hi>I would I were in Chriſt</hi>; thou wouldſt faine be in Chriſt, and yet thou art loth to ſtir out of that baſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per thou art in. This is an impoſſibility, a folly and no will; <hi>woulding and no willing.</hi> I grant the Saints of God have their wouldings, and their would does go further then their wil; <hi>their wil is abſolutely ſet to be holy,</hi> and they would be holy. Their will is deeply to be humbled, and they would be deeper; their <hi>would is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a will,</hi> they will in ſome meaſure and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54043:57"/>
they would go further. I will, oh that I could will more. But thou that lieſt in thy ſinfull eſtate, <hi>thy would is pure folly.</hi> A would groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a <hi>will</hi> not is foppiſh; the <hi>Saints would is grounded upon a will</hi>;<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>but thine, the roote at bottome is this thou wilt not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, may be thou <hi>haſt a generall meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicall will,</hi> but to come to <hi>particulars,</hi> there <hi>thou wilt not.</hi> I hate the Saints of God? God forbid? I'le never hate them while I live; and yet come to this Saint and that Saint; <hi>him thou wilt hate; him?</hi> Hee is the verieſt <hi>hypocrite</hi> in the Country, and keepes more adoe then needs.<note place="margin">When car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men can diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhin the Saints, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they charg them with hypocriſy.</note> Thus thy will is good to a company of metaphyſicall Saints in the cloulds; but thoſe that are Gods <hi>Saints in particular, thou mockeſt.</hi> I be ſtubborne againſt the Commandements of God? I will not be ſtubborne againſt them; yea but <hi>this and that Commandement thou wilt not obſerve.</hi> Thou wilt not thinke beſt of them of whom thou ſhouldſt, nor take up that carriage in meetings that thou ſhouldſt; thou haſt a good will to the Commandements in <hi>affection,</hi> but thy will ſtands againſt the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of them. Generalls are but Notions, when they are abſtracted from the particulars.</hi> And therefore thy will is but a <hi>Notion; the will</hi> when it willeth indeed, willeth <hi>particulars,</hi> this <hi>particular</hi> duty, this <hi>particular Ordinance.</hi> Indeed good in the <hi>general</hi> is the <hi>object of the will,</hi> but when the will comes to will in the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe</hi> of it it <hi>pitcheth on particulars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, thou haſt <hi>no true will,</hi> I ſpeake ſtill to the carnall, I ſay thou haſt no true will,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54043:57"/>
becauſe if thou <hi>truly didſt will, thou couldſt</hi>; if thou didſt truly will to believe, and will to be a new creature, thou couldſt; for the will it hath <hi>potentiam execuvtiuam,</hi> ſo <hi>far as it will, &amp;c.</hi> It hath an executing power to go ſo far as it wills; if thou didſt truly and really will to ſpeak holy, thy will would make thy tongue to put it in execution. If thou hadſt a will, thy will would command execution, <hi>my tongue ſhall ſpeake the praiſe of the Lord</hi> ſayes <hi>David, Pſal,</hi> 119.171.172. <hi>my ſoule it ſhall prayſe thee</hi> verſ. 175. I grant the woulding of the will goes further then all execution can go, <hi>to will is preſent with me, but how to performe that which is good, I finde not, Rom.</hi> 7.18. I quote this place the rather becauſe many wreſt it to their own <hi>destruction.</hi> Oh ſayes a wicked man, I have a a good will, I would as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>but J can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not performe,</hi> thus men miſinterpret this place; for <hi>looke how far</hi> Paul <hi>would, he could performe,</hi> for the will hath <hi>potentiam executricem</hi> and an imperative force over the man. What he did will, he did performe, he performed it in <hi>his heart</hi> and <hi>tongue and hand, &amp;c.</hi> but he would draw his will forwarder then it was, but he could not, his very will was partly unwilling, hee could not indeed performe ſo much as he would, that is, he could not draw on his will ſo ſtrongly as he would. His will was not perfectly ſanctified, no Saint in this World hath any perfect completeneſſe of will; and therefore his performance is not perfect becauſe his will is not perfect. I ſay if thy will be converted to God, thou thy ſelfe art conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54043:58"/>
to God, obedience ever goes as far as the will. And therefore if thou art <hi>willing, its certaine thou art obedient</hi>; if yee be willing and obedient ſayes the Text, <hi>Iſay</hi> 1.19. whoſoever is willing to obey, that man does obey in ſome meaſure, becauſe the will hath power of execution, and the whole man at command. This is the reaſon why <hi>Divines</hi> ſay, that the <hi>ſincerity of the will is the condition of the Goſpell</hi>; wherefore if thou beeſt not obedient, neither art thou willing to obey, all the powers of thy ſoule and all the members of thy body, thy will hath an <hi>actus imperativus</hi> to command them. Now if thy will will not command them to yeild, thou art not ſo much as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at all; if a Juſtice of peace ſhould tell me he would give me a Warrant, and yet when all comes to all, he will not command his clark for to write it, nor his own hand for to pen it, I ſee plainly he will not. Doſt thou ſay <hi>I would obey Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>J would</hi> deny ſelfe, why then <hi>doſt thou not command thy Clerke for to writ it?</hi> If thy will will not command tongue, <hi>Tongue</hi> thou ſhalt never talke ſo unprofitably as thou haſt done, and <hi>Eare</hi> thou ſhalt never hearken after vanity as thou haſt done; and thoughts, <hi>Thoughts</hi> yee ſhall never run at rovers as yee have done. <hi>Jf your will were but willing, it would command your whole ſoule, ſoule thou ſhalt not do as thou haſt done</hi>; as <hi>Davids</hi> will commanded his ſoule <hi>O my ſoule bleſſe the Lord, and forget thou not all his benefits, Pſalme</hi> 103.2. nay he commanded <hi>all that was in him, all that is in me, bleſſe his holy name,</hi> verſ. 1. So if
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54043:58"/>
thou wert willing, thy will would command all thy ſoule; ſoule, thou ſhalt not be ſo ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome at the throne of grace at thou art, &amp;c. thus much of the ſecond objection drawn from the will.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, your <hi>deſtruction is moſt juſt,</hi> you cannot alleadge ſeverity or cruelty; no; your ſelves are the cruell ones. You judge your own ſelves unto Hell. The Lord <hi>preſſeth the Goſpell</hi> of grace upon you, and you <hi>put it off.</hi> Acts 13.46.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, your <hi>deſtruction is inexcuſable,</hi> you have nothing to excuſe you; God hath taken way all clokes of excuſes, he hath offered you <hi>ſaving knowledge</hi> and you <hi>would not</hi>; a <hi>Chriſt and you would not; good motions,</hi> counſels, threatnings, and you would not.

                  <p>Fourthly, your <hi>deſtruction is unavoydable;</hi> if you would have relented and yeilded, there might have beene hope, but you would not.

If the theife will ſteale and will to the Gallowſe, let him go; he is no object of pity; as we ſay of a wilfull man, no tale can tune him to take heed, ſo no meanes can tune you to take heed; and therefore when you rue it, you <hi>cannot be pittied.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, your <hi>destruction is grievous</hi>; of all plagues, none will fret more, then thoſe which one hath wilfully puld on himſelfe. You'le one day gnaſh your own teeth, <hi>curſe your owne wills,</hi> banne your own hearts; woe is me, I am <hi>under the rod,</hi> and my ſelfe gathered it; <hi>in Hell,</hi> and my ſelfe kindled it.

                  <p>Secondly, hereby thou <hi>dodgeſt with God, and thou tempteſt the Lord.</hi> If God would give me grace I would doe it; this is nothing but dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying and trifling with the Lord; for why doſt thou not ſet about it and <hi>try every day what thou canſt doe?</hi> If God would but quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me and perſwade me, and compell me, and inable me, I would doe it.

Wee cannot be Saints, and wee are not able to be ſo holy; theſe pleas bring an evill report on Religion. Like the <hi>ſpies</hi> that brought an evill report upon <hi>Canaan. Num.</hi> 13.23. What ſayes the Text in the verſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before? we be not able to get it, ſay they, verſe 31. this made the reſt of the <hi>people thinke hardly of their going into Canaan</hi>; they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thought it was to very little end. Oh they were not able to winne it; ſo yee bring an evill report upon the <hi>Heavenly Canaan,</hi> the fleſh is too ſtrong, the divell too ſtrong, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations too ſtrong, and its impoſſible to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with them all, wee are not able to get maſtery. I ſay this brings up an evill report on Religion, yee diſcourage one another. I cannot get quickning, and I cannot deny my ſelfe. Yee bring up an evill report upon theſe duties, and yee are guilty of the evill report that goes up and down.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this ſame <hi>pleading is a murmuring

                     </gap>es God give mee ſuch Commandements, that I cannot obſerve?</hi> Why does he charge mee to root out a luſt that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not root out? this is to murmur againſt God. Like thoſe <hi>murmuring Diſciples</hi> in the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> when they were told they muſt feed upon Chriſt, and as the <hi>body</hi> feeds upon <hi>meate,</hi> ſo <hi>your ſoules muſt feede upon Chriſt</hi>; this is a hard ſaying, who can heare it ſay they? <hi>Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued</hi> this ſpeech to be <hi>murmuring,</hi> Joh. 6.60.61. Wee cannot do this, and this is ſo hard we are not able to do it. The Text ſayes it was murmuring, <hi>when Jeſus knew in himſelfe that his Diſciples murmured at it</hi>; that plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>cannot was a murmuring.</hi> So when thou grumbleſt on this manner I cannot walk thus, I cannot believe thus, &amp;c. this is to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur againſt God, nay this will bring thee to <hi>Apoſtacy at laſt,</hi> if thou ſuffer thy heart to plead thus. May be now thou art a forward profeſſor, yet beeſt thou never ſo forward, and favoureſt any luſt, and I cannot give it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I cannot root it out, &amp;c. I ſay this will breake thy neck at the laſt, if thou doſt not looke to it. So it was with thoſe forenamed Diſciples, they were very forward Profeſſors, for they were the Diſciples of Chriſt ſayes the Text; yet thoſe <hi>Diſciples, they went away back and walked no more with Chriſt,</hi> verſ. 66. their pleading of their cannots, drove them to Apoſtacy; they went away back. So thou wilt goe away back, and fall into <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> if thou ſuffer thy heart to ſtand <hi>pleading of cannots in this manner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:54043:73"/>Fourthly, this is the <hi>ſawſieſt excuſe of all excuſes,</hi> many ſinners excuſe their own ſelves, but there is more <hi>mannerlineſſe in all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes</hi>; I pray thee have mee excuſed ſayes one. I have bought <hi>five yoake of Oxen, and I pray thee have mee excuſed</hi>; ſayes the other, <hi>I have bought a purchaſe,</hi> I pray thee have mee excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Theſe though wretched excuſers and turned out from all mercy, yet they were ſomewhat more <hi>mannerly</hi>; but I cannot come, ſayeſt thou; I have married a Wife, <hi>and J cannot come,</hi> Luke 14.20. this is a moſt ſawcy excuſe, thou telleſt Chriſt in plaine termes, I cannot come, <hi>q.d.</hi> yee may even ſave your labour to invite, for this is the ſhort and long, as we ſay, I cannot come.

               <p>I ſhewed you ſome of the deceits of the heart in pleading theſe cannots.</p>
               <p>Firſt, How it <hi>lies unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, how it <hi>dallies with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, how <hi>hereby it puts off the word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then I ſhewed you the ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we have to be humbled under theſe will-nots.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe heere cheifly <hi>lies the pride of the heart, not in mens Cannots, but in their will-nots,</hi> Jer. 13.17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, here lies <hi>cheifly the hardning of the heart,</hi> Ex. 9.34.35.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, here lies cheifly <hi>the ſtubborneneſſe of the heart,</hi> Deut. 21.18.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, here lies chiefly <hi>the greateſt deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54043:74"/>
of the Commandements of God,</hi> Levit 26.15.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, now to go on, here lies the reaſon why <hi>Divines</hi> ſay that <hi>the converſion of a ſinner is a harder worke then the Creation of Heaven and Earth</hi>; for thus they do reaſon. When God created Heaven and Earth, hee had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to reſiſt him; as hee had nothing to helpe him, (he made all of nothing) ſo he had nothing to reſiſt him. There was but <hi>one difficulty</hi> in the <hi>creation of Heaven and Earth</hi>; but in the <hi>converſion of a ſinner there be two difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, here is the <hi>ſame difficulty that was in creation, for God makes a Convert of nothing</hi>; he had nothing to helpe him, not one thought, not one deſire, not one good inclination, and therefore the Scripture calles it <hi>a new creation</hi>;<note place="margin">Note.</note> whoſoever is in <hi>Chriſt is a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> 2 Cor 5.17. that is, is created anew. And therefore, there was nothing praeixiſtent, no <hi>not one thought, all the thoughts of men are onely evill, and that continually.</hi> So there is the ſame difficulty, that was in the Creation of Heaven and Earth; and then</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is another difficulty more then there was in the Creation; for as there was nothing praexiſtent to helpe, ſo there was <hi>nothing to reſiſt. But here is ſomething to reſiſt, the will it reſiſteth</hi>; now the <hi>Cannot does not reſiſt. No, the beſtowing of the new powers is no more then another Creation. But the changing of the will is more then another Creation; for the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54043:74"/>
will it reſiſteth, yea and it ſets all the ſoule a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting.</hi> Carnall reaſon reſiſteth, carnall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires they reſiſt, all the ſoule it reſiſteth; and the <hi>greateſt reſiſtance</hi> of all is the <hi>reſiſtance of the will</hi>; for the will is the utmoſt ſtrength of the ſoule. And therefore here lies the infinite difficulty of the converſion of a ſinner, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the turning of the will; it requireth more power, then was required to the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Heaven and Earth. God puts himſelfe forth more when hee converteth a ſinner, then when hee created a World; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture calles the day of <hi>converſion of mens wills, the day of his power.</hi> Thy people ſhall be <hi>willing in the day of thy power,</hi> Pſal. 110 3. In the day of thy power; marke; its cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a day of Gods power, when hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth a people to be willing. Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the will did reſiſt him;<note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>nay God had his owne ſelfe to reſiſt him, anger</hi> ſteps in his way to reſiſt him. Convert him not Lord, his wilfulneſſe hath anger'd thee; <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſtept in to reſiſt him, ſave him not Lord, his ſinnes have diſhonoured thee. Nay, he had his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to reſiſt him; <hi>mercy</hi> ſteps in, Lord hee hath abuſed mee, ſave him not. Indeed had a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner yeilded as ſoone as hee ſinned, mercy would not reſiſt him; but mercy had bee dealing with him, and hee abuſed all mercy. And therefore hee had mercy to reſiſt, nay and <hi>wiſdome</hi> one would thinke to reſiſt too, <hi>what a wilfull foole? pitty him not Lord.</hi> There is no reaſon hee ſhould be pitied, if hee will
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54043:75"/>
periſh let him periſh. <hi>I ſay in the converſion of a ſinner, as there was nothing to aſſiſt him, ſo there was all to reſiſt.</hi> The will does reſiſt him, nay God had himſelfe as I may ſo ſpeake to reſiſt him; yea, and mercy to reſiſt him; it was not ſo in the Creation of Heaven and Earth. <hi>The creature had never provoked God not to create it; but the ſinner hath provoked God never to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him,</hi> ſo that now God muſt have power over himſelfe if hee meane to convert him. Oh then what infinite reaſon haſt thou to be humbled; thou reſiſteſt God, as <hi>Stephen</hi> told the Jewes, <hi>you have alwayes reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 7.51. ſo thou haſt <hi>reſisted Gods ſpirit,</hi> yea, thy will does reſiſt him, and that is the ſtrongeſt thing to reſiſt in the World. His word comes to convert thee, and thou doſt reſiſt his motions, his mercies, his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, his ordinances and all holy meanes to convert thee, thou doſt reſiſt them; nay his <hi>ſpirit contendeth</hi> within thee, and thou <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt reſiſt him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I gave you five things to conſider, <hi>what it is to ſticke at your wil nots.</hi> I beſeech you conſider yet further,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>If you will not, Gods Miniſters have diſcharged their duties, and have left your blood on your owne heads</hi>; they can goe no further if you will not: the Groome can but carry the Steed unto watering as we ſay, if he will not drinke he cannot helpe it; ſo they can't helpe it, your blood lies upon your owne heads, they have diſcharged their duties.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54043:75"/>
When <hi>Abrahams ſervant objected,</hi> and how if the woman will not? Abraham he anſwers, if the woman will not be willing, <hi>then thou ſhalt be cleare from my oath. Gen.</hi> 24.8. So Lord, how if they will not? may we ſay, nay if they will not, let them chuſe, thou art cleare; the Lord hath ſworne us to preach, and teach, and exhort, and reprove, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite you to grace; but if we doe ſo, and you will not, we can't helpe it, <hi>your blood is on your owne heads</hi>; wee have diſcharged our oath and our duty, we would be glad that you would; but if now you will not, we have diſcharged our duties. Nay,</p>
               <p>Secondly, if you will not, the <hi>Goſpel hath delivered its errand,</hi> yee are <hi>guilty of your owne everlaſting perdition</hi>; the Goſpel hath delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red its meſſage, and this is the meſſage, <hi>Whoſoever will, let him take of the water of life freely, Revelat.</hi> 22.17. This meſſage hath been delivered to you often; <hi>its the laſt exhortation in the whole Bible:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> like one in the evening of the market, he is even about to take downe his ſtanding; I have told you my lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt price, if you will have it, take it; if not, chuſe, I muſt be gone. So this is the <hi>end of Gods booke</hi>; as if he ſhould ſay, I am even a cloſing up my booke, ſpeake quickly, if yee <hi>will, come, and welcome</hi>; but if not, I am gone. If yet you will not, you will not ſubmit; nay but you will have your luſts, and your ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes will not come downe, you will not ſtirre a jot beyond your painted civility and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54043:76"/>
formality; you will not be more conſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then you have been, nor frequent holy duties more then you have done: nor get more holineſſe then you have done, <hi>then if Will will have will, Will muſt winne woe</hi>; the Goſpel hath delivered its meſſage.</p>
               <p>Nay,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if you will not; <hi>the blood of Jeſus Chriſt hath done that it came for</hi>: it came to <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you mercy upon very eaſie termes</hi>; to offer you grace and pardon, and ſalvation and Heaven, and all upon <hi>very free coſt.</hi> If you had rather that <hi>ſinne</hi> ſhould be your <hi>maſter,</hi> then that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be your <hi>maſter</hi>; if you will not hearken and obey, I ſay the blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done that which it came for; and your <hi>ſoules ſhall know yee ſhall be worſe offered:</hi> you have knowledge of the truth, Chriſt hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered you very faire, and you cannot but know it, and yet you will not ſubmit to it; aſſure your ſelves you ſhall be worſe offered: for next to your <hi>wil nots, comes Chriſt leaving you deſolate.</hi> As Chriſt <hi>told Jeruſalem, I would, but you would not</hi>; what followes? Behold <hi>your houſe is left unto you deſolate, Mat.</hi> 23.37.38. So Chriſt would, and you would not; he he hath given you gracious offers, but you will not: therefore you may look to be worſe offered, your ſoules to be deſolate. Nay,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>If you will not, yee murder your own ſoules</hi>; when a man hath murdred himſelfe, the Coroner comes and he does ſit on him, and he enquires and he examines, and who hath
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54043:76"/>
murthered this man? and when he findes that it was himſelfe that did murther him, ſo he concludes, and that man is branded for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of himſelfe; ſo you murther your owne ſoules. The <hi>Jewes their ſoules were all murdred</hi>; well, when the Coroner ſate on them, he concluded they had murdred themſelves: <hi>O Iſrael thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelfe, Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. So if the Coroner ſet on thee, its moſt certaine he ſhall finde thou haſt murdred thine owne ſelfe; O what a company of you is there, your ſoules are quite murdred; one in one ſinne, another in another; who hath mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred theſe men? <hi>not God,</hi> he was <hi>ready to helpe them:</hi> not the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> he did uſe all <hi>meanes to ſave them</hi>; he hath not been wanting to teach them and exhort them. No, your own ſelves have murdred your ſelves; <hi>you would be carnall, and you would be proud, and you would not lie downe to the word</hi>: when the Coroner ſits on you, he muſt neceſſarily conclude, you have murdred your ſelves; your owne wils have condemned you.</p>
               <p>You remember what exhortations we gave you. As ever you regard mercy to humble your ſoules, we told you the <hi>firſt queſtion Chriſt askes, is, if yee be willing,</hi> as he ask'd the blind man, <hi>what wilt thou? Luke.</hi> 18.41. if thou beeſt not willing, hee'l never take thee in hand: <hi>the ſubjects of the kingdome of grace muſt be willing.</hi> Chriſt will never come into a ſoule, where his will may be affronted by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;<note place="margin">Caelum non patitu<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

No, no, your wils they muſt bow, or Chriſt wil not take you in hand; <hi>the wil is the general preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of all the whole goſpel:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> the ſumme of the whole Goſpel is this, to deny a mans ſelfe and take up Chriſts croſſe and ſo follow him; now ſee the wil is preſuppoſed as ready; if any man wil come after me, let him deny himſelf, &amp;c. <hi>Luke.</hi> 9.23. ne're a commandment of the goſpel, ne're a promiſe, ne're an one paſſage but preſuppoſes the wil; Chriſt will not open his mouth except thy will be brought downe.</p>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>We can never diſpleaſe God but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon wil nots.</hi> I ſpeake onely upon Gods people; we can never ſtaine our acceptance with God, but onely in our wil nots; <hi>though we cannot but ſinne in our prayers,</hi> but ſinne in our duties, but ſin in every thing that we doe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet this does not ſtaine our acceptance with God, nor blemiſh it one whit, <hi>when God hath our wills:</hi> for if <hi>there be a willing minde, it is accepted according to that which a man hath, and not according to that which a man hath not,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. But when God would have us mend this, and we will not; and reforme that and we will not; we let ſecurity and ſloth breake in to our wils, here and here onely doe wee

deſpleaſe our good God, this is a maine thing to conſider; is there but one thing wherein we may diſpleaſe God, and ſhall we not take heed of that!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Conſcience can never condemne us but onely upon wil nots</hi>; when a child of God ſinnes, and he cannot otherwiſe chooſe, his conſcience can never condemne him. A <hi>child of Gods cannots,</hi> be they never ſo many, nay if they were millions more then they are, they never <hi>hinder ſincerity</hi>; ſincerity is rooted one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the will, it is <hi>our wil not that is the breach of ſincerity,</hi> and therefore here onely the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience condemnes</hi>; does our conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach us in our wayes? let us thanke our <hi>wil nots</hi> for this; have we little peace? it is becauſe o' the <hi>rebellion of our wil nots.</hi> Ah, ah, this is an infinite evill, for it hinders our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, it hinders our boldneſſe of acceſſe to the throne of Gods grace, it hinders our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and every good duty, this does us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite hurt; it ſtabbes to the heart, and wounds our very ſoule, when our conſcience affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth little peace, O it hinders very grievouſly; all this is long of our <hi>wil nots,</hi> becauſe wee will not be ſo carefull and ſo circumſpect as we might.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>God can never be angry with us but onely upon wil nots</hi>; its true as long as a man is not in Chriſt, all the ſcore ſtands, and God is angry for all; but God is angry for nothing but <hi>wil nots in his children,</hi> as <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah ſaies of Gods people in Judah, they would
