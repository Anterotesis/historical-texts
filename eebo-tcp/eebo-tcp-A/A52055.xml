            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:38504:4"/>
should establish: I suppose the reverend Authours were willing to lie hid under this <hi>ONOMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STICK,</hi> partly that their work might not be received with prejudice, the faction against which they dealt, arrogating to themselves a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly of Learning, and condemning all others as ignorants and novices not worthy to be heard; and partly that they might not burden their Frontis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece with a <hi>voluminous nomenclature,</hi> it not being usuall to affix so many names at length to one Treatise.</p>
            <p>For the work it self, it speaketh its own praise, and is now once more subjected to thy censure and judgement: This second publication of it was occasioned by another book for <hi>vindication of the Ministery</hi> by the Provinciall Assembly of <hi>London,</hi> wherein there are frequent appeals to <hi>Smectymnuus;</hi> though otherwise I should have judged the reprinting seasonable; for the Lord hath now returned us to such a juncture of time, wherein there is greater freedom of debate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out noyse and vulgar prejudice; and certainly if the quarrell of Episcopacy were once cleared, and brought to an issue, we should not be so much in the dark in other parts of Discipline, the conviction of an <hi>errour</hi> by <hi>solid grounds</hi> being the best way to finde out the <hi>truth;</hi> reformations carried on with <hi>popular tumult,</hi> rather then <hi>rationall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Helena,</hi> whose Champion this Remonstrant chiefely is, is that <hi>Government</hi> which he calls <hi>Sacred,</hi> viz. that <hi>Government by Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Deanes, Archdeacons, &amp;c.</hi> which, saith he, through the sides <hi>of some misliked persons some have endeavoured to wound.

                  <hi>without any interruption,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38504:6"/>
without contradiction of any one congregation in the world unto this present age.</hi> This is but an <hi>Episcopall Bravado</hi>; therefore we let it passe, till we come to close and contend with him in the point; where we shall demonstrate, that in the compasse of three lines he hath packt up as many untruths, as could be smoothly couched in so few words, as any man of common understanding, that lookes upon the face of the Government of almost all reformed Churches in the Christian world may at first view discover.</p>
               <p>But before we come to this, there are yet two things in this Preface which we count not unworthy observation. The <hi>First</hi> is, the comparison which he makes between the two Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Civil which with us <hi>is Monarchy</hi>: and the sacred which with <hi>him is Episcopaey.</hi> Of the first he saith,<note place="margin">Remon. pag. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>if Antiquity may be the Rule</hi> (as he pleades it for Episcopacy) or if Scripture (as he interprets Scripture) it is VARIABLE, and ARBITRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY: but the other DIVINE and VNALTERABLE: so that had men petitioned for the altering of <hi>Monarchicall</hi> Government, they had (in his Judgement) been lesse culpable, both by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Antiquity, then in petitioning the alteration of the <hi>Hierarchicall</hi>: Had he found but any such passage in any of his <hi>Lewd Libellers</hi> (as his modesty is alwayes pleased to terme them) certainly if we may borrow his own phrase, the eares of the <hi>three Interessed Kingdomes, yea all the neigbbour Churches, and if we may say, the whole Christian world, and no small part beyond it,</hi> had run with the loud cryes of no lesse then <hi>Treason, Treason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truth is, in his <hi>Antiquity</hi> we finde that <hi>this his uninterrupted sacred Government</hi> hath so farre invaded the Civil, and so yoked Monarchy, even in this Kingdome, as <hi>Malmesbury</hi> reports: That <hi>William Rufus oppressed by Bishops,</hi> perswaded the Jewes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them;<note place="margin">Malmsbury lib. 4.</note> promising thereupon to turne <hi>England</hi> to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that he might be free of Bishops. And this is so natural an effect of <hi>unalterable Episcopacy,</hi> that <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Embassador, importuning him to permit Bishops to be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> to be <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> gave this answer:<note place="margin">Hist. Concil. Trid.</note> That his King knew not what he did desire; for if Bishops should be so declared, they would be all exempted from his Power, and as independent as the Pope himself.</p>
               <p>The second thing observable is the comparison he makes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the late <hi>Alterations</hi> attempted in our Neighbour Church by his Episcopal faction, and that <hi>Alteration</hi> that is now justly desired by the <hi>humble Petitioners</hi> to this <hi>Honourable House.</hi> The one being attempted by strangers, endeavoring violently to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38504:7"/>
                  <hi>Innovations</hi> upon a <hi>setled Church and State,</hi> The other <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly petitioned</hi> to the <hi>Heads and Princes</hi> of our State by <hi>Multitudes</hi> therein <hi>almost ruined by an Innovating</hi> Faction: yet doth not this Remonstrant blush to say; if <hi>these be branded,</hi> (so he calls the just censures of this Honourable House) <hi>for Incendiaries, how shall these Boutefeux escape, &amp;c.</hi> thus cunningly indeavouring either to justifie the former by the practise of the latter,<note place="margin">

               <p>The attempts of these men whom he would thus render o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, he craves leave to present to your Honours in two things, which are the subjects of this quarrel: The <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Episcopacy</hi>; and we <hi>humbly crave your Honours leave in both to answer.</hi>

               <p>But howsoever this applause of conceived prayer may seem to be Cordial, yet he makes it but a <hi>vantage ground</hi> to lift up <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like formes of sacred Church Liturgy</hi> (as he calls it) the higher, that they may have the greater <hi>honour,</hi> that by the <hi>power of your autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they be reinforced,</hi> which work there would have been no need to call your <hi>Honours</hi> to, had not <hi>Episcopal zeal</hi> broke forth into such flames of indignation against conceived prayers, that we have more just cause to implore the <hi>propitious aide</hi> of the same <hi>Authority</hi> to <hi>re-establish the Liberty of this,</hi>

               <p>Yet there are two specious Arguments which this Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant brings to perswade this desired re-inforcement, the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and Confirmation of our Liturgy.</p>
               <p>For the first, he tels your <hi>Honours,</hi> it was <hi>selected out of ancient. Models not</hi> Roman <hi>but</hi> Christian, <hi>contrived by the holy Martyrs and Confessors of the blessed reformation of Religion</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 13.</note> where we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech your <hi>Honours</hi> to consider how we may trust these men, who sometimes speaking and writing of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime it a true Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> and yet here <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> stand in opposition: sometimes they tell men, their Liturgy is wholly taken out of the <hi>Romane Missal,</hi> onely with some little alteration: and here they would perswade your Honours there is nothing <hi>Romane</hi> in it. But it is wholly selected out of pure <hi>Ancient Models,</hi> as the <hi>Quintessence</hi> of them all. Whereas alas the original of it, is published to the world, in that Proclamation of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt.</p>
               <p>And though here they please to stile the Composers of it, <hi>holy Martyrs and contrivers of the blessed Reformation:</hi> yet there are <hi>of the Tribe for whom he pleads,</hi> not a few that have called them <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> rather then <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and <hi>Deformers</hi> rather then <hi>Reformers</hi> of our Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> His other Argument for the Liturgy is taken from that <hi>supply of strength it hath received from the recommendation of foure most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Princes, and your own Parliamentary establishments: and more
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38504:9"/>
especially from the Proclamation of King</hi> James <hi>of famous memory</hi>: the validity of which plea, your Honours are best able to judge, and therefore we leave it at your Bar; yet these two things we know: first, that this <hi>forme</hi> was never <hi>established</hi> to be so <hi>punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally observed,</hi> so <hi>rigorously pressed,</hi> to the <hi>casting out of all that scruple it, or any thing in it</hi> (as many of his Majesties Subjects now doe) to the (<hi>almost)</hi> justling out of the <hi>preaching of the Word</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Prayer altogether.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And secondly, as sure we are, that your <hi>Honours</hi> think neither your own Lawes, nor the Proclamation of that <hi>most famous and ever admired Prince,</hi> to be as unalterable as the Lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now having briefly shewed, that <hi>Liturgies</hi> are not of that <hi>antiquity</hi> that this <hi>Remonstrant</hi> pretends, but that <hi>conceived prayer</hi> was in <hi>use</hi> in the Church of God before <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and is <hi>justified from their own mouthes,</hi> and not to be <hi>found fault with by any but a gracelesse man</hi>: and having likewise shewed that <hi>our Liturgy was taken</hi> out of Models, not onely <hi>Christian</hi> but <hi>Romane,</hi> and had since the first compiling of it suffered <hi>alteration</hi> to the <hi>worse</hi>; and though <hi>established by Law,</hi> and confirmed by Proclamation, was never intended to the justling out, either of preaching or concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved prayer; these things declared, we humbly crave your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours leave to propound these two <hi>Queries.</hi>

                  <p>Whether it be not fit to consider of the alteration of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Liturgy.</p>
                  <p>First, because it symbolizeth so much with the Popish Masse,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as that the Pope himself was willing to have it used, if he might but confirme it.</p>
                  <p>It was made and composed into this frame, on purpose to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> bring the Papists to our Churches, which we finde to be with so little successe, as that it hath rather brought many of us to them, then any of them to us, and hath lost many of ours from us.</p>
                  <p>Because many things therein contained are stumbling blocks <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> before the feet of many: such as these, the clogging it with Ceremonies, and the often and impertinent reiterating of the Lords Prayer, the ill translation of the Psalmes, and other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the many phrases in the very prayers, which are liable to just exception. And whereas the Minister by the Scripture is the peoples mouth to God, this book prescribes Responsories to be said by the people, some of which are unsutable to what the Minister pronounceth, some of them seem to savour of Tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38504:10"/>
some are made to be so essential to the prayer, as that all which the Minister saith, is no prayer without them; as in the <hi>Letany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Because it is so much Idolized, as that it is accounted the only worship of God in <hi>England,</hi> and is now made the upholder of a non-preaching Ministry, and is cryed up to that height, as that some are not ashamed to say;<note place="margin">

                  <p>There are such multitudes of people, that distaste this book, that unlesse it be altered, there is no hope of any mutual agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between Gods Ministers and their people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> There is such a vast difference between it, and the Liturgies of all other reformed Churches, as that it keepes them at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from us, and us from full Communion with them.</p>

                  <p>Whether the first reformers of Religion did ever intend the use of a Liturgy further, then to be an help, in the want, or to the weaknesse of a Minister.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> All other reformed Churches, though they use Liturgies, yet doe no binde their Ministers to the use of them.</p>

And if it can be thought no lesse then sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge to rob the people of the Ministers gift in preaching, and to tye them to Homilies, it can be no lesse, to deprive them of their gift in prayer.</p>
                  <p>The ground of the first binding of it upon all to use, was not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to tye godly men from exercising their gift in prayer; but the old Popish Priests, that by a seeming returne to our Religion did through indulgence retaine their places, from returning to the old Masse.</p>
                  <p>That which makes many refuse to be present at our Church service, is not onely the Liturgy it self, but the imposing of it upon Ministers. And we finde no way to recover our people to a stinted prayer, but by leaving it free to use or not to use.</p>

                  <p>Why should the free liberty of using or not using a Liturgy,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> breed more confusion then the free liberty of reading or not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Homilies? especially when Ministers shall teach people, not to condemne one another in things indifferent.</p>
                  <p>If there be a care taken in those that have the power to make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Ministers, to choose men gifted as well for prayer as preaching, there cannot be conceived how any inconvenience should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Or if afterwards it should appeare, that any Minister should prove insufficient to discharge the duty of prayer in a conceived way, it may be imposed on him as a punishment, to use set forms and no other.

               <p>Fourthly, he saith it hath thus continued <hi>without the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of any one Congregation in the Christian world.</hi> It seemes he hath forgotten, what their own darling <hi>Heylin</hi> hath written of the people of <hi>Biscay in Spaine,</hi> that they admit of no Bishops to come among them; for when <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholike came in progresse accompanied among others with the Bishop of <hi>Pampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, the people</hi> rose up in Armes, drove back the Bishop,<note place="margin">

But we reade the same in the Spanish Chronicle, who saith more then the Doctor: for he tels us that the People threw that dust that the Bishop or his Mule had trode on, into the Sea with <hi>Curses and Imprecations</hi>: which certainly saith he was not done without some <hi>Mystery,</hi> those people not being voide of Religion, but superstitiously devout as the rest of the Spaniards are: so that there is one Congregation in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world in which this Government hath met with contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>And are not the <hi>French, Scottish,</hi> and <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches worthy to be counted Christian Congregations? and who knowes not that amongst these this Government hath met not onely with verbal but reall contradiction?</p>

               <p>Their Identity is discernable: first, from the same names given unto both: secondly, from the same office designed unto both in Scripture. As for the names, are not the same names given unto both in Sacred Writ? Let the fifth, sixth, and seventh verses of the first Chapter to <hi>Titus</hi> testifie: in the fifth verse, the Apostle shews that he left <hi>Titus</hi> in Creet to ordain Elders in every City; in the sixth verse, he gives a delineation of the persons that are capable of such Ordination: and in the seventh, the Reason, why the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be ordained, must be so qualified: <hi>for a Bishop, &amp;c.</hi> Now if the Bishop and Elder be not here the same, but names of distinct of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and order, the Apostles reason rendred in the seventh verse of his direction in the fifth and sixth verses, is (with reverence be it spoken) inconsequential, and his demand unjust. If a Chancellor in one of the Universities should give order to his Vice-Chancellor to admit none to the degree of Batchelour in Arts, but such as were able to preach, or keep a Divinity Act: <hi>For Batchelours in Divinity must be so</hi>: what reason or equity were in this? So if <hi>Paul</hi> leaving <hi>Titus</hi> as his <hi>Lecum tenens,</hi> as it were in Creet for a season, should give order to him not to admit any to be an <hi>Elder</hi> but one thus and thus qualified, because a Bishop must be so: had a Bishop been an Order or Calling distinct from, or superior to a Presbyte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and not the same, this had been no more rational or equal then the former: therefore under the name of Bishop in the seventh verse the Apostle intends the Elder mentioned in the fifth verse. Consonant to this is the Language of the same Apostle, <hi>Acts.</hi> 20. v. 17.18. where such as in 17. verse he calls <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that this <hi>Presidency</hi> was of such as laboured in the word and Doctrine.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the Censures of the Church were managed not by one, but by them all in <hi>Communi. Them that admonish you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, that there was among them a <hi>Parity</hi>: for the Apostle bids <hi>know them</hi> in an <hi>indifferency,</hi> not discriminating one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: yea such was the rule that Elders had, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> thought it needful to make an exhortation to them to use their power with <hi>Moderation,</hi> not <hi>Lording it over Gods Heritage,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3.</p>
               <p>By this time we have sufficiently proved from Scripture, that <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> are the same in name, in Office, in Edifying the Church, in power of Ordination and Jurisdiction: we sum up all that hath been spoken in one argument:</p>

                     <hi>Cephas,</hi> the Churches were governed by the Common-councell of the Presbyters. But after that each man began to account those whom he had baptized his own, and not Christs; it was decreed thorow the whole world, that one of the Presbyters should be set over the rest; to whom the care of all the Church should belong, that the seeds of schisme might be taken away. Thinks any, that this is my opinion, and not the opinion of the Scripture, that a Bishop and an Elder is the same? let him read the words
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38504:16"/>
of the Apostle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> the servants of Jesus Christ, to them that are at <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi,</hi> with the Bishops and Deacons, <hi>Philippi</hi> is one city of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and certainly in one city there could not be <hi>many Bishops</hi> (as they are now called &amp;c.) and after the allegations of many other Scriptures, he concludes thus; as the Elders therefore may know, that they are to be subject to him that is set over them by the custome of the Church; so let the Bishops know, that it is more from custome, then from any true dispensation from the Lord, that they are above the Presbyters, &amp; that they ought to rule the Church in common.</p>
                  <p>In which words of <hi>Ierome,</hi> these five things present themselves to the Readers view;</p>
                  <p>First, that <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> are originally the same; <hi>Idem. ergo est Presbyter qui Episcopus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that that Imparity that was in his time between Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Elders, was grounded upon Ecclesiastical custome, and not upon devine Institution; <hi>Episcopi noverint, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that this was not his private judgement, but the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Scripture; <hi>Putat aliquis, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that before this Priority was upon this occasion star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Church was governed <hi>Communi Presbyterorum Consilio,</hi> by the Counsel of the Presbyters in common, and that even after this imparity, it ought to be so governed; <hi>Sciant Episcopi se Ecclesiam debere in communi regere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, that the occasion of this Imparity and Superiority of Bishops above Elders, was the divisions which through the Devils instinct fell among the Churches; <hi>Postquam verò Diaboli instinctu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saravia</hi> would take advantage of this place, to deduce this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity as high as from the Apostles times, because even then they began to say, <hi>I am of Paul, and I of Apollos</hi>: but sure S. <hi>Ierome</hi> was not so weake as this man would make him, to speak Inconsistencies; and when <hi>he propounds</hi> it to himself, to prove that <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> are in <hi>Scripture</hi> the same, to let fall words that should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute his own proposition: whereas therefore S. <hi>Ierome</hi> saith, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38504:16"/>
                     <hi>after men began to say, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, &amp;c. it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that one of the Presbyters should be set over the rest, &amp;c.</hi> This is spoken indeed in the <hi>Apostles phrase,</hi> but <hi>not of the Apostles times,</hi> else to what purpose, is that coacervation of texts that followes?</p>
                  <p>But suppose it should be granted to be of Apostolical antiquity (which yet we grant not, having proved the contrary) yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, it was not of <hi>Apostolical intention,</hi> but of <hi>Diabolical occasion</hi>: And though the Devil by kindling Divisions in the Church, did minister <hi>Occasion</hi> to the invention of the primacy or prelacy or one for the suppressing of Schisme; yet there is just cause to think, that the Spirit of God in his Apostles was never the author of this invention.</p>
                  <p>First, because we read in the Apostles dayes there were Divisions,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.7. and Schismes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. and 11.18. yet the Apostle was not directed by the holy Ghost to ordaine Bishops for the taking away of those Divisions. Neither in the rules he prescribes for the healing of those breaches, doth he mention <hi>Bishops</hi> for that end: Nor in the Directions given to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> for the <hi>Ordination of Bishops or Elders,</hi> doth he mention this as one end of their <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> or <hi>one peculiar duty of their office.</hi> And though the Apostle saith, <hi>Oportet haereses inter vos esse, ut qui probati sunt manifesti fiant inter vos</hi>; yet the Apostle no where saith, <hi>Oportet Episcopos esse, ut tollantur haereses, quae manifestae fiunt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, because as Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi> saith, the remedy devised <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> hath proved worse then the disease, which doth never happen to that remedy whereof the holy Ghost is the author.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because the holy Ghost, who could foresee what would ensue thereupon, would never ordaine that for a remedy, which would not onely be ineffectual to the cutting off of evil, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a stirrup for Antichrist to get into his saddle. For if there be a necessity of setting up one <hi>Bishop</hi> over many <hi>Presbyters</hi> for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting schismes, there is as great a necessity of setting up one <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop over many Bishops,</hi> and one <hi>Patriarch over many Archbishops,</hi> and one <hi>Pope over all,</hi> unlesse men will imagine, that there is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of schisme onely among <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and not among <hi>Bishops and Archbishops,</hi> which is contrary to <hi>reason, truth, History,</hi> and our own <hi>Experience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And lest our adversaries should appeale from <hi>Hierome</hi> as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent Judge in this case, because a Presbyter, and so a party, we will therefore subjoyne the judgments of other ancient Fathers who were themselves Bishops.</p>
                  <p>The Commentaries that go under the name of Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. mention another occasion of this Discrimination or

First, in that <hi>Sole Iurisdiction</hi> which our Bishops assume to themselves. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in the <hi>Delagation</hi> they make of the <hi>power of exercising</hi> this Jurisdiction unto others. Thirdly, in the <hi>way of the exercise of that power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the first of these, <hi>Their sole Iurisdiction</hi>; That our <hi>Bishops</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume this to themselves, it is <hi>known</hi> and <hi>felt,</hi> and that this <hi>Sole Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction</hi> was a <hi>stranger,</hi> a <hi>Monster</hi> to former times, we shall now prove, and make cleare; that the power of <hi>Ordination, Admonition, Excommunication, Absolution,</hi> was not in the hands of any sole man.</p>
               <p>First, for <hi>Ordination, Cyprian</hi> in his exile writing to his Charge, certifies them, that <hi>Aurelius was ordained by him and his Colleagues,</hi>

                  <hi>who were present with him</hi>; (who were these Colleagues, but his Presbyters; as he himself expounds it, writing to <hi>Lucius</hi> in his own name, and the name of his Clergy and people, <hi>Ego &amp; Collegae &amp; fraternitas omnis, &amp;c.</hi>

So that it is cleare in <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, <hi>Presbyters</hi> had a hand in <hi>Ordination,</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> did not Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine alone. <hi>Firmilianus</hi> saith of them that rule in the Church, <hi>Quod baptizandi,</hi>

               <p>The iniquity of our times hath been such, that a Minister may not Preach to his own flock, without a Licence: doth this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence make a man a Minister, and give him power to preach, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a faculty and liberty to exercise that power?

               <p>First, that these Fathers put all the difference that lies betweene Bishops and Presbyters, to be in point of Ordination. <hi>Quid facit Episcopus, quod non facit Presbyter exceptá Ordinatione.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Chrysostome</hi> himselfe confesseth, that in his days there was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no difference between a Bishop and a Presbyter. <hi>Inter Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copum &amp; presbyterum interest fermè nihil, &amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, That this difference is not so to he understood, as if these Fathers did hold it to be by divine right (as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and our Episcopal men would make us beleeve) but by a humane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. And therefore they do not speak <hi>De jure</hi> but <hi>de facto,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>We may observe in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> whilst persecution separated him from his Church, when questions did arise among his people, he doth not send them to his Chancellour or Commissary; No, he was so far from substituting any man (much lesse a <hi>lay man</hi>) to determene or give Judgement in such cases, that he would not assume that power wholly to himself, but suspends his Judgement, till the hand of God should restore him to his Church againe, that with the advice and Counsel of the Presbyters, he might give sentence: as may appeare to any that shall peruse his Epistles.</p>
               <p>Sure if God had ever led his Church to such a way of deputation, it would have been in such a case of Necessity as this was: or had any footsteps of such a course as this been visible by this holy Martyr in the goings of former ages, he needed not have deferred the determination of the question about the receiving of some penitent lapsed ones into the bosome of the Church again, till his returne and the returne of his Clergy, as he doth.</p>

               <p>And though these two Bishops went at first abreast in this point, yet in a short time the Roman had out stripped the Alexandrian in that power, till the Church degenerating more and more, that Roman Priest advanced his power not onely above all the Bishops, but all the Monarchs in the Christian Orbe.</p>

termed any Apostle a Bishop of this or that City (as namely S. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Antioch</hi> or <hi>Rome)</hi> they meant it in a general sort and signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, because they did attend that Church for a time, and supply that roome in preaching the Gospel, which Bishops did after; but as the name of Bishop is commonly taken for the <hi>Overseer</hi> of a particular Church, and Pastor of a several flock; so <hi>Peter</hi> was not Bishop of any one place; therefore not of Rome. And this is true by <hi>Analogy</hi> of all extraordinary Bishops, and the same may be said of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> that he saith of <hi>Peter.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But if <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were no Bishops, or had not this power, it may be the Angels of the <hi>seven</hi> Asian <hi>Churches</hi> had; and our Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant is so subtile as to twist these two together, that if one faile, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may hold.</p>
               <p>To which we answer; first, that Angel in those Epistles is put <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively,</hi> not <hi>Individually</hi>; as appears by the <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Thyatira, cap.</hi> 2. <hi>vers.</hi> 25. where we read <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. But I say unto <hi>you</hi> (in the plural number, not unto <hi>thee</hi> in the singular) <hi>and unto the rest in Thyatira, &amp;c.</hi> Here is a plain distinction between the members of that Church. <hi>By you,</hi> is signified those to whom he spake under the name of the Angel. By <hi>the rest,</hi> the residue of the people. The people governed, and the Governours in the plural number. What can be more evident
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38504:25"/>
to prove, that by <hi>Angel</hi> is meant not one singular person, but the whole company of Presbyters that were in <hi>Thyatira.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This also further appears, because it is usual with the holy Ghost, not only in other Books of the Scripture, but also in this very Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> to express a company under one singular person. Thus the Civil State of Rome, as opposite to Christ, is called <hi>A beast with ten horns:</hi> and the Ecclesiastical State Antichristian is called <hi>the whore of Babylon,</hi> and, <hi>the false Prophet</hi>; and the Devil and all his family is called <hi>An old red Dragon.</hi> Thus also the seven Angels that blew the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven trumpets, <hi>Revel.</hi> 8.2. and the seven Angels that poured out the seven Vials, are not literally to be taken, but Synecdochically, as all know. And why not then the seven Angels in those Epistles? Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in his Commentaries upon the <hi>Revelation,</hi> pag. 265, hath these words; <hi>Denique (ut jam femel iterum<expan>

               </p>
               <p>Adde, thirdly, that the very name <hi>Angel</hi> is sufficient to prove, that it is not meant of one person alone, because the word <hi>Angel</hi> doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any peculiar jurisdiction or preheminence, but is a common name to all Ministers, and is so used in Scripture. For all Ministers are Gods Messengers and Embassadours, sent for the good of the Elect. And therefore the name being common to all Ministers, why should wee think that there should be any thing spoken to one Minister, that doth not belong to all? The like argument we draw from the word <hi>Stars</hi> used <hi>Revel,</hi> 1.20. <hi>The seven Stars are the Angels of the seven Churches.</hi> Now it is evident, that all faithful Ministers are called Stars in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whose duty is to shine as lights unto the Churches, in all purity of doctrine and holiness of conversation. And in this sense, the word is used, when it is said, that <hi>the third part of the stars were darkned,</hi> Revel. 8.12. and that the <hi>Dragons taile drew the third part of the stars of Heaven, and cast them to the Earth,</hi> Revel. 12.4. Which is meant not only of Bishops, but of other Ministers, unlesse the Bishops will appropriate all corruption and Apostacy unto themselves.</p>
               <p>Adde, fourthly, out of the Text it selfe, it is very observable, that our Saviour in opening the mystery of the Vision, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.20. saith; <hi>The seven Candlesticks which thou sawest, are the seven Churches,</hi> but he doth not say, The seven Stars are the seven Angels of the same Churches, <hi>But the Angels of the seven Churches</hi>; wherein not without some mystery the number of the Angels is omitted, least we should understand by Angel, one Minister alone, and not a company. And yet the Septenary number of Churches is twice set down.</p>
               <p>Lastly, though but one Angel be mentioned in the fore-front, yet it is evident, that the Epistles themselves are dedicated to all the Angels
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38504:25"/>
and Ministers in every Church, and to the Churches themselves: And if to the whole Church, much more to the Presbyters of that Church. This is proved <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.11. <hi>What thou seest, write in a Book, and send it to the seven Churches which are in</hi> Asia. And also by the Epiphonema of every Epistle; <hi>He that hath an care to hear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches.</hi> Upon which words, <hi>Ambrosius Ausbertus</hi> in his second book upon the <hi>Revelation,</hi> saith thus; <hi>Vnâ eadem<expan>
                        <am>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> locutione &amp; Angelos &amp; Ecclesias unum esse designat. Nam cum in principio locutionum quae ad septem fiunt Angelos dicat, &amp; Angelo illius Ecclesiae scribe; in fine tamen earundem non dicit, Qui habet aurem audiat quod spiritus dicat An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo, sed quid Ecclesiae dicat.</hi> By one and the same phrase of speech he sheweth, the Angels and the Churches to be one and the same. For whereas in the beginning of his speech, which he makes to the seven Churches, he saith, <hi>And write to the Angel of the Churches</hi>; yet in the close of the same, he doth not say, He that hath an Eare, let him heare what the Spirit saith to the Angel, but <hi>what he saith to the Church.</hi> And this is further proved by the whole argument of those Epistles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the admonitions, threatnings, commendations, and reproofes, are directed to all the Ministers of all the Churches. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.10. <hi>The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil shall cast some of you into prison, &amp;c.</hi> Revel. 2.16. <hi>I will fight against them with the sword of my mouth,</hi> Revel. 2.24. <hi>I will put upon you no other burthen, &amp;c. I say unto you and the rest of</hi> Thyatira, <hi>as many as have not this Doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, &amp;c.</hi> And when it is said in the singular Number (as it is often) <hi>I know thy works and labour, &amp;c.</hi> vers. 2. and vers. 4. <hi>Repent and do thy first works</hi>; and vers. 13. <hi>Thou hast not denyed my Faith, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>cap.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Because thou art neither hot nor cold, &amp;c.</hi> All these and the like places, are not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood as meant of one individual person, but of the whole compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Ministers, and also of the whole Church, because that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment threatned, is to the whole Church; <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Repent and do thy first works, or else I will come unto thee quickly and remove thy Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick out of his place</hi>; Rev. 2.16. <hi>Repent, or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against thee with the sword of my mouth</hi>; Revel. 2.24. <hi>I will not put upon you any other burthen.</hi> Now we have no warrant in the Word to think that Christ would remove his Gospel from a Church for the sin of one Bishop, when all the other Ministers, and the Churches themselves are free from those sins. And if God should take this course, in what woeful &amp; miserable condition should the Church of <hi>England</hi> be, which groaneth under so many corrupt Prelates? By all this it appears, that the word <hi>Angel,</hi> is not to be taken, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; not properly, but figuratively. And this is the judgment of Master <hi>Perkins</hi> upon the second Chapter of the <hi>Revelation</hi>: and of Master <hi>Brightman</hi>: and of Doctor <hi>Fulke,</hi> who in answer to the Rhemists in <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.20. hath these words: S. <hi>Iohn</hi> by the Angels of the Churches
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38504:26"/>
meaneth not all that should wear on their heads Myters, and hold crosier staves in their hands, like dead Idols, but them that are the faithful messengers of Gods word, and utter and declare the same. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they are called the Angels of the Churches, because they be Gods messengers.</p>
               <p>Master <hi>Fox</hi> likewise in his Meditation upon the <hi>Revelation</hi> (pag. 7.9.17.) is of this opinion, and hath gathered to our hands the opinions of all Interpreters he could meet, and saith that they all consent in this that under the person of an Angel, the Pastors &amp; Ministers of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were understood. S. <hi>Austin</hi> in his 132. Epistle, saith thus, <hi>Sic enim in Apocalypsi legitur Angelus, &amp;c. Quod si de Angelo superiorum colorum, &amp; non de</hi> Praepositis Ecclesiarum <hi>vellet intelligi, non consequenter diceret,</hi> Habeo adversum te, &amp;c. And so in his second Homily upon the <hi>Revelation</hi> (if that book be his) <hi>Quod autem dicit Angelo Thyatirae.</hi> Habeo adversum te panca, <hi>dicit</hi> Praepositis Ecclesiarum, &amp;c, This also <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, <hi>lib.</hi> 34. <hi>Moral. in Iob. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Saepe sacram scripturam praedicatores Ecclesiae pro eo quod patris gloriam annunciant, angelorum nomine solere designare: &amp; hinc esse, quod Iohannes in Apocalypsi</hi> septem Ecclesiis scribens, angelis Ecclesiarum loquitur, <hi>id est,</hi> Praedicatoribus populorum. Master <hi>Box</hi> citeth <hi>Primasius, Haymo, Beda, Richard, Thomas,</hi> and others, to whom we refer you.</p>
               <p>If it be here demanded (as it is much by the Hierarchical side) that if by Angel be meant the whole company of Presbyters, why Christ did not say, to the Angels in the plural number, but to the Angel in the singular?</p>
               <p>We answer, that though this question may savor of a litle too much curiosity, yet we will make bold to subjoyn three conjectural reasons of this phrase of speech.</p>
               <p>First, it is so used in this place, because it is the common language of other Scriptures in types and visions to set down a certain number for an uncertain, &amp; the singular number for the plural. Thus the Ram, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.3. is interpred vers. 20. to be the Kings of Media, and Persia. And the enemies of Gods Church are set out by four horns. And the deliverers by four Carpenters, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.18.20. And the wise and foolish Virgins are said to be five wise and five foolish. And many such like. And therefore as we answer the Papists, when they demand why Christ if he meant figuratively when he saith, <hi>this is my body,</hi> did not speak in plain language, <hi>this is the sign of my body</hi>? We say, that this phrase of speech is proper to all Sacraments: So we also answer here, this phrase of speech, <hi>Angel</hi> for <hi>Angels,</hi> is common to all types and visions.</p>
               <p>Secondly Angel is put, though more be meant, that so it may hold proportion with the vision which <hi>Iohn</hi> saw, Chap. 1.12.20. <hi>He saw se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven golden Candlesticks, and seven Stars.</hi> And therefore to hold propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Epistles are directed to seven Angels, and to seven Churches.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38504:26"/>
And this is called a mystery, Revel. 1.20. <hi>The Mystery of the seven Stars. &amp;c.</hi> Now a mystery is a secret which comprehends more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed; and therefore though but one Angel be expressed, yet the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery implyes all the Angels of that Church.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to signifie their unity in the Ministerial function, and joynt commission to attend upon the feeding and governing of one Church, with one common care, as it were with one hand and heart. And this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> more fitly declared by the name of one Angel, then of many. We of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten finde the name of (one) Prophet or Priest to be put for the general body of the Ministery, or whole multitude or Prophets or Priests, in the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> or <hi>Iudah,</hi> when the Spirit of God intendeth to reprove, threaten, or admonish them. Thus it is <hi>Iere.</hi> 6.13.18.19. <hi>Isa.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Hos.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.26. <hi>Hos.</hi> 4, 6. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. Neither should it seem strange, that a multitude or company of Ministers should be understood under the name of one Angel, seeing a multitude of Heavenly Angels (imployed in one service for the good of Gods Saints) is sometimes in the Scripture shut up under one Angel in the singular number, as may be gathered from <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.7. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.35. <hi>Psal</hi> 34.7. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Psal.</hi> 91.11. <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.1. 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 6.16, 17. And also a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Devils or evil Angels, jointly labouring in any one work, is set forth under the name of one evil or unclean spirit, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.21, 22. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.23, 24. <hi>Mark</hi> 5.2.9. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.33.34. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.27.30. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.11.12.</p>
               <p>But now let us suppose (which yet notwithstanding we will not grant) that the word <hi>Angel</hi> is taken individually for one particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> seems to interpret it, together with Master <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> yet nevertheless<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, there will nothing follow out of this acception<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that will any ways make for the upholding of a Diocesan Bishop, with sole power of Ordination and Jurisdiction, as a distinct Superior to Presbyters. And this appears,</p>
               <p>First, because it never was yet proved nor ever will (as we conceive) that these Angels were Diocesan Bishops, considering that Parishes were not divided into Diocesses in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> days. And the seven Stars are said to be fixed in their seven Candlesticks or Churches, not one Star over divers Candlesticks. Neither can those Churches be thought to be Diocesan, when not onely <hi>Tindal</hi> and the old translation, calls them seven Congregations, but we read also <hi>Acts</hi> 20. that at <hi>Ephesus</hi> which was one of those Candlesticks, there was but one flock.</p>
               <p>And secondly, we further finde that in <hi>Ephesus</hi> one of those seven Churches, there were many Presbyters, which are all called Bishops, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. and we finde no colour of any superintendency or superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of one Bishop over another. To them in general the Church is committed to be fed by them without any respect had to <hi>Timothy,</hi> who stood at his Elbow, and had been with him in Macedonia, and was now
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38504:27"/>
waiting upon him to Jerusalem. This is also confirmed by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> who writing of the Heresies of the <hi>Miletians,</hi> saith, that in ancient times this was peculiar to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that it had but one Bishop, whereas other Cities had two. And he being Bishop of <hi>Cypres,</hi> might well be acquainted with the condition of the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> which were so nigh unto him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is nothing said in the seven Epistles that implyeth any superiority or majority of rule or power that these Angels had over the other Angels that were joyned with them in their Churches. It is written indeed, in commendation of the Angel of the Church of <hi>Ephesus, that he could not beare them that were evil, and that he had tryed them which say they were Apostles and are not, and had found them lyers.</hi> And it is spoken in dispraise of the Angel of <hi>Pergamus, that he suffered them which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But suppose that there were some superiority and prehemenency in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated by this individual Angel, yet who knoweth not that there are diverse kinds of superiority? to wit, of Order, of Dignity, of Gifts and Parts, or in degree of Ministery, or in charge of power and juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. And how will it be proved that this Angel if he had a supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, had any more then a superiority of Order, or of Gifts and Parts? Where it is said, that this Angel was a superior degree or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Ministery above Presbyters? In which Epistle is it said that this Angel had sole power of Ordination and Jurisdiction? And therefore as our learned Protestants prove against the Papists, that where Christ directed his speech to <hi>Peter</hi> in particular and said, <hi>I will give unto thee the Keys of the kingdom of Heaven; &amp;c.</hi> That this particularization of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> did not import any singular preheminence or majority of power to <hi>Peter</hi> more then to the other Apostles; But that though the promise was made to <hi>Peter,</hi> yet it was made to him in the name of all the rest, and given to all as well as one. And that therefore it was spoken to one person, and not to all; that so Christ might fore-signifie the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Church, as <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Cyprian, Austin, Hierome, Optatus,</hi> and others say.

And that which is written to him, is written to the rest as well as to him.

               <p>If therefore our <hi>Remonstrant</hi> can produce no better evidence for his Hierarchy then <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and the <hi>Angels of the Asian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> Let not this Remonstrant and his party, cry out of wrong, <hi>if this claimed Hierarchy be for ever booted out of the church,</hi> seeing it is his owne Option. And yet we cannot conceale one refuge more out of Scripture, to which the Hierarchy betake themselves for shelter. And that is the two Postscripts in the end of <hi>Pauls</hi> second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and of that to <hi>Titus</hi>; where in the one, <hi>Timothy</hi> is said to be the first Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and in the other, <hi>Titus</hi> is said to be the first Bishop of the Church of the <hi>Cretians</hi>: to both which places wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
               <p>That these two Postscrips (and so all the rest) are no part of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Scripture. And therefore our former and ancienter English translations, though they have these Postscripts, yet they are put in a small character different from that of the Text. Although our Episcopal men of late in newer impressions have inlarged their Phylacteries, in putting those Postscripts in the same full cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter with that of the Text, that the simple might beleeve they are Canonical Scripture. The Papists themselves <hi>(Baronius, Serrarius,</hi> and the Rhemists) confesse that there is much falsity in them. The first Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> is thus subscribed: <hi>the first to</hi> Timothy <hi>was written from</hi> Laodicea, <hi>whoch is the chiefest City of</hi> Phrygia Pacatiana. Here wee demand, whether <hi>Paul</hi> when hee writ the first Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> was assured he should live to write a second, which was written long after? And if not; How comes it to bee subscribed, <hi>the first to Timothy,</hi> which hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to a second? Besides, the Epistle is said to bee writ from <hi>Laodicea,</hi> whereas <hi>Beza</hi> in his Annotations proves apparently, that it was written from <hi>Macedonia</hi>; to which Opinion <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Serrarius</hi> subscribe. It is added, <hi>Which is the chiefest City of Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia Pacatiana.</hi> But this Epithet is nowhere read in the Writers of those ages, saith <hi>Beza, Sed apud recentiores illo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

writing of the Epistles by some men, for the most part <hi>vel indoctis,</hi> saith <hi>Beza, vel certe non satis attentis,</hi> Either by a Learned, or negligent man.</p>
               <p>The second Epistle is thus subscribed; <hi>The second Epistle unto</hi> Timothy, <hi>ordained the first Bishop of the Church of the</hi> Ephesians, <hi>was written from</hi> Rome, <hi>when</hi> Paul <hi>was brought before</hi> Nero <hi>the second time.</hi> Now these words <hi>Ordained the first Bishop,</hi> is wanting, saith <hi>Beza, in quibusdam vetustis codicibus, in veteri vulgatâ editione, &amp; apud Syrum interpre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>m.</hi> If Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had written this Postscript, he would not have said, <hi>To</hi> Timothy <hi>the first Bishop, &amp;c.</hi> whereas it was not yet certain whether ever there should bee a second. Neither would it bee said when <hi>Paul was brought, &amp;c.</hi> But when I was the second time brought before <hi>Nero.</hi> The Syriack Interpreter reads it, <hi>Here ends</hi> the <hi>second Epistle to</hi> Timothy <hi>written from</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>The Epistle to <hi>Titus</hi> is thus subscribed: <hi>Written to</hi> Titus, <hi>Ordained first Bishop of the Church of the</hi> Cretians, <hi>from</hi> Nicopolis <hi>of</hi> Macedonia. Here it is said that this Epistle was written from <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> whereas it is cleare that <hi>Paul</hi> was not at <hi>Nicopolis</hi> when he wrote it. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.12. Be <hi>diligent to come to me at</hi> Nicopolis, <hi>for I have determined there to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Hee doth not say, <hi>Here to winter,</hi> but <hi>There</hi>; Where note, for the present he was not there. And besides it is said, that <hi>Titus</hi> was <hi>Ordained the first Bishop, &amp;c.</hi> And who was the second? or was there ever a second? And also <hi>He is said to be Bishop,</hi> not onely of a Diocess, <hi>but of all Creet.</hi> Was there ever such a second Bishop? Adde, lastly, that it is said, <hi>Bishop of the Church of the</hi> Cretians; Whereas it would bee said of the <hi>Churches of the Cretians.</hi> For the Christian Churches of any Nation are called Churches by <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> not Church. Therefore <hi>Codex Claremontanus</hi> subscribes; <hi>Here ends the Epistle to</hi> Titus, and no more. So the Syriack; <hi>Finitur Epistola ad</hi> Titum <hi>quae scripta fuit è Nicopoli.</hi> The old Vulgar Edition hath nothing of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy of <hi>Titus.</hi> By all this it appears, that if the Bishops had no more authority to urge us to subscribe to their Ceremonies, then they have authority for their Episcopal Dignity by these Subscriptions, there would be no more subscription to Ceremonies in the Churches of England.</p>
               <p>But some will say, that there is one objection out of Scripture yet unanswered, and that is from the inequality that was betweene the twelve Apostles, and the seventy Disciples.</p>
               <p>To which we answer;</p>
               <p>First, that it cannot be proved that the twelve Apostles had any su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over the seventy, either of Ordination, or Jurisdiction, or that there was any subordination of the seventy unto the twelve: but suppose it was, yet we answer</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:38504:28"/>Secondly, that a superiority and inferiority betweene Officers of different kindes, will not prove that there should be a superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and inferiority between Officers of the same kinde. No man will deny but that in Christs time, there were Apostles, Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, Prophets, Pastors, and Teachers, and that the Apostles were superior to Evangelists and Pastors But it cannot be proved, that one Apostle had any superiority over another Apostle, or one E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist over an other. And why then should one Presbyter be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver another? Hence it followeth, that though we should grant a superiority between the twelve and the seventy, yet this will not prove the question in hand. Because the question is concerning Officers of the same kind, and the instance is of Officers of different kinds, amongst whom no man will deny but there may be a supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority and inferiority, as there is amongst us between Presbyters and Deacons.</p>
               <p>And now let your <hi>Honours</hi> judge (considering the premisses) how far this Episcopal government is from any <hi>Divine right,</hi> or <hi>Apostolical Institution:</hi> And how true that speech of <hi>Hierome</hi> is, that a Bishop as it is a superiour Order to a Presbyter, is <hi>an Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane presumption,</hi> not a <hi>Divine Ordinance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though Scripture fails them, yet the indulgence and Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of <hi>Religious Princes</hi> may support them, and to this the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrant</hi> makes his next recourse, yet so as he acknowledgeth here, <hi>Ingagements to Princes onely for their accessory dignities, titles, and Maintenance; not at all for their stations and functions,</hi> (wherein yet the author plainly acknowledgeth a difference between our <hi>Bishops</hi> and the <hi>Bishops of old</hi> by such accessions.)</p>
               <p>For our parts, we are so farre from envying the <hi>gracious Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of pious Princes, in collating honourable maintenance upon the Ministers of Christ,</hi> that we beleeve, that <hi>even by Gods own Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, double Honour</hi> is due unto them.</p>
               <p>And that by how much the <hi>Ministery of the Gospell</hi> is more <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable</hi> then that of <hi>the Law,</hi> by so much the more ought all that embrace the <hi>Gospell,</hi> to be carefull to provide, that the <hi>Ministers of the Gospell</hi> might not onely live, but maintain Hospitalitie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule of the <hi>Gospell.</hi> And that <hi>worthy Gentleman</hi> spake as an Oracle, that said, <hi>That scandalous Maintenance is a great caues of a scandelous Ministery.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But the pith of his answer after a few good words is this, that no such consequent can be drawn from their opinion; for their <hi>Ius di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum</hi> pleads only for a <hi>Iustifiablenesse of this holy calling:</hi> not for an absolute necessity of it, <hi>warranting it where it is, and requiring it where it may be had; but not fixing upon the Church that wants it, the defect of any thing of the Essence of a Church, but only of the glory and perfection of it</hi>; neither is it their sin, but their misery.</p>
               <p>And is it so, doth not this <hi>Ius divinum</hi> argue a <hi>Necessitie,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Iustifiablenesse</hi> of this calling? nor is the want of it a want of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing of Essence, but onely of perfection? we had thought, that page the 20th, where this <hi>Remonstrant</hi> strives to fetch the <hi>pedegree of Episcopacie</hi> from no lesse than <hi>Apostolicall,</hi> and in that right <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine institution</hi> he had reckoned it among those things, which the Apostles ordained for the succeeding administration of the Church <hi>in essentiall matters</hi>: but here it seemes he is willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract what there fell from him: there it was to his advantage to say, this Government was a thing essentiall to the Church, and here it is no lesse advantage to say, it is not essentiall.</p>
               <p>But if it be not Essentiall, then what is the reason that when a <hi>Priest</hi> who hath received Orders at <hi>Rome,</hi> turnes to us, they urge not him to receive ordination among us again: but when some of our brethren, who flying in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, had received <hi>Imposition of hands</hi> in the Reformed Churches beyond the Seas, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again in the dayes of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> they were urged to receive Imposition of hands againe from our Bishops, and some did receiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If those Churches that want Bishops, want nothing essentiall to a Church; then what <hi>Essentiall</hi> want was there in the Ordination of those <hi>Ministers</hi> that received Imposition of hands in those Churches, that might deserve a <hi>Re-ordination,</hi> more than if they had first received their Ordination at <hi>Rome</hi>?</p>
               <p>And what is the reason that Bishop <hi>Mountague</hi> so confidently affirmes, that Ordination by Episcopall hands is so necessary,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>d with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it? And if this <hi>Remonstrant</hi> should leave Bishop <hi>Mountague</hi> to answer for himself, yet notwithstanding he stands bound to give us satisfaction to these two questions, which arise from his own Book.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:38504:31"/>First, whether <hi>that Office,</hi> which by <hi>divine right</hi> hath the <hi>sole power of Ordaining,</hi> and <hi>Ruling</hi> all other <hi>Officers</hi> in the Church, (as he saith Episcopacie hath) belong not to the being, but onely to the glory and perfection of a Church? Secondly, there being (in this mans thoughts) the same <hi>Ius divinum</hi> for Bishops, that there is for <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> whether if those <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> too, they should want nothing of the <hi>Essence</hi> of a Church, but of the <hi>perfection and glory of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this <hi>Remonstrant</hi> seemes to know so much of the minde of those Churches, <hi>that if they might have their option, they would most gladly embrace Episcopall Government, as little differing from their own Moderatorship, save onely in the perpetuitie of it, and the new Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (as he odiously calls it) <hi>of lay-Elders.</hi> But no question those learned Worthies that were intrusted <hi>by the Churches to compile their Confessions, did comprise their Iudgements better</hi> than the <hi>Composer of this Remonstrance.</hi> And to his presumtion, we oppose their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.

                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:38504:31"/>We believe that the true Church ought to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that policy which Christ Jesus our Lord esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, <hi>viz.</hi> that there be Pastors, Presbyters, or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Deacons. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, We believe that all true Pastors whereever they be, are endued with equal and the same power, under one chief Head and Bishop Christ Jesus. Consonant to this the <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches: We believe (say they) the true Church ought to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with that spiritual policy which God hath taught us
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:38504:31"/>
in his Word, to wit, that there be in it Pastors to preach the Word purely, Elders and Deacons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute the Ecclesiastical Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that by these means Religion may be preserved, and manners corrected.

                  <p>In which Harmony of these Confessions, see how both Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches agree in these five points:</p>
                  <p>First, That there is in the Word of God, an exact form of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Government set down; <hi>Deus in verbo suo edocuit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That this form of Government Christ established <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in his Church; <hi>Iesus Christus in Ecclesiâ sancivit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That this form of Government is by Pastors, Elders,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and Deacons.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That the true Church of Christ ought to be thus go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                     <hi>Veram Ecclesiam debere regi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, That all true Ministers of the Gospel are of equal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> power and authority.</p>
                  <p>For the reason he assigns, why those Churches should make this Option, we cannot enough admire that such a passage should fall from his pen, as to say, There is <hi>little difference between their <gap reason="foreign">

as between the <hi>Duke of Venice</hi> and an <hi>absolute Monarch.</hi> For, 1, the Moderator in <hi>Geneva</hi> is not of a superiour order to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; nor 2, hath an Ordination differing from them; nor 3, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes power of sole Ordination or Jurisdiction; nor hath he 4, maintenance for that Office above his Brethren; nor 5, a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive voice in what is agreed by the rest; nor 6, any further power then any of his Brethren.

As also by <hi>Albaspineus,</hi> in his Edition of <hi>Optatus</hi>: in which Acts the <hi>Seniors</hi> are often mentioned. In that famous relation of the purging of <hi>Caecilianus</hi> and <hi>Felix,</hi> there is a copie of a Letter; <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribus &amp; filiis: Clero &amp; Senioribus, Fratribus in Domino aeternam salutem:</hi> Another Letter is mentioned a little before, <hi>Clericis &amp; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioribus Cirthensium in Domino aeternam Salutem.</hi> These Seniors were interessed in affaires concerning the Church as being the men, by whose advice they were managed.</p>
               <p>The Letter of <hi>Purpurius</hi> to <hi>Silvanus</hi> saith, <hi>Adhibete conclericos, &amp; seniores plebis, Ecclesiasticos Viros, &amp; inquirant quae sint iste Dissensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones: ut ea quae sunt secundum fid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

affairs; that by their wisdom and care peace might be set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Church; for which cause, these <hi>Seniors</hi> are called <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical men</hi>; and yet they are distinguished from <hi>Clergie men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are mentioned again afterwards by <hi>Maximus,</hi> saying, <hi>Loquor nomine SENIORUM Populi Christiani. Greg.

               <p>So again, <hi>Optatus,</hi> who mentioning a persecution that did for a while scatter the Church, saith, <hi>Erant Ecclesiae ex auro &amp; argento quàm plurima Ornamenta, quae nec defodere terrae, nec secum portare poterat, quare fidelibus Senioribus commendavit Albaspineus,</hi> that learned Antiquary, on that place acknowledges, that <hi>Besides the Clergie there were certain of the Elders of the people, men of approved life, that did tend the affairs of the Church, of whom this place is to be understood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all these testimonies it is apparent; first, that in the ancient Church there were some called <hi>Seniors,</hi> Secondly, that these <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors</hi> were not Clergie men. Thirdly, that they had a stroke in governing the Church, and managing the affairs thereof Fourthly, that <hi>Seniors</hi> were distinguished from the rest of the people.</p>

               <p>As for the learned <hi>Spanhemius</hi> whom he produceth, though we give him the deserved honour of a worthy man: yet we think it too much to speak of him, as if the judgment of the <hi>whole Church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THere are yet two things with which this <hi>Remonstrance</hi> shuts up it self, which must not be past without our Obelisks.</p>
               <p>First, he scoffs at the <hi>Antiprelatical Church,</hi> and the <hi>Antiprela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Divisions</hi>; for our parts, we acknowledge no <hi>Antiprelatical Church.</hi> But there are a company of men in <hi>the Kingdom, of no mean rank or quality,</hi> for <hi>Piety, Nobility, Learning,</hi> that stand up to bear witness against the <hi>Hierarchie</hi> (as it now stands:) their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpations over Gods Church and Ministers, their cruel using of Gods people by their tyrannical government: this we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and if he call these the <hi>Antiprelatical Church,</hi> we doubt not but your Honours will consider, that there are many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands in this Kingdom, and those pious and worthy persons, that thus do, and upon most just cause.</p>
               <p>It was a speech of <hi>Erasmus</hi> of <hi>Luther, Vt quisque vir est optimus, it is illius Scriptis minimè offendi</hi>; The better any man was, the less offence he took at <hi>Luthers</hi> Writings: but we may say the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Prelates, <hi>Ut quisque vir est optimus, it à illorum factis magis offendi</hi>; The better any man is, the more he is offended at their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. And all that can be objected against this party, will be like that in <hi>Tertullian. Bonus vir Cajus Sejus, sed malus tantùm, quia An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiprelaticus.</hi>

                  </note> But he upbraids us with our <hi>Divisions</hi> &amp; <hi>Subdivisions,</hi> so do the Papists upbraid the Protestants with their <hi>Lutheranisme, Calvinisme,</hi> and <hi>Zuinglianisme.</hi> And this is that the Heathens ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the Christians, their Fractures were so many, they knew not which Religion to chuse if they should turn Christians: And can it be expected that the Church in any age should be free from Divisions, when the times of the Apostles were not free? and the Apostle tells us, <hi>It must needs be that there be divisions:</hi> in <hi>Greg. Naz.</hi> dayes there were 600 Errours in the Church; do these any wayes derogate from the truth and worth of Christian Religion?</p>
               <p>But as for the Divisions of the Antiprelatical party, so odiously exaggerated by this Remonstrant: Let us assure your Honours, they have been much fomented by the <hi>Prelates,</hi> whose practice hath been according to that rule of <hi>Machiavil: Divide &amp; Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera,</hi> and they have made these divisions, &amp; afterwards complain'd of that which their Tyranny and Policy hath made. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, considering the paths our Prelates have trod, that there are Divisions in the Nation. The wonder is our divisions are no more,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:38504:36"/>
no greater; and we doubt not but if they were of that gracious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> spirit, and so intirely affected to the peace of the Church as <hi>Greg, Naz.</hi> was, they would say as he did in the tumults of the people, <hi>Mitte nos in mare, &amp; non erit tempest as</hi>; rather then they would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that sweet <hi>Concordance,</hi> and conspiration of minde unto a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that shall be every way agreeable to the rule of Gods Word, and profitable for the edification and flourishing of the Church,</p>
               <p>A second thing we cannot but take notice of, is the pains this <hi>Author</hi> takes to advance his <hi>Prelaticall Church:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>these severall thousands are punctually calculated.</hi> But we doubt not but your Honours will consider that there may be <hi>multi homines, &amp; pauci viri</hi>; and that there are more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them then for them.</p>
               <p>And whereas they pretend, that they differ from us onely in a Ceremony or an Organ-pipe, (which however is no contemptible difference) yet it will appeare that our differences are in point of a superiour Alloy.

                  <note place="margin">

               <p>First, if he ask what are the bounds of this Church? we answer him out of the sixt of their late founded Canons: where we finde the limits of this Prelatical Church extend as farre as from the high &amp; lofty Promontory of Archbishops, to the <hi>

               </p>
               <p>If what <hi>Distinction of professors and Religion</hi>; we answer, their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping towards the East, and bowing towards the Altar prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselves in their approches into Churches, placing all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in outward formalities, are visible differences of these profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours and their Religion</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If what new Creed</hi> they have, or what grounds of Faith differing from their Neighbours? we answer, Episcopacy by divine right is the first Article of their Creed, Absolute and blinde obedience to all the Commandements of the Church (that is, the Bishop and his Emissaries) election upon faith foreseen, the influence of works in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Iustification,</hi>

                  <p>Whether seeing it hath been proved, that Bishops (as they are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> novv asserted) are a meere humane Ordinance, it may not by the same Authority be abrogated, by vvhich it vvas first established; especially, considering the long experience of the hurt they have done to Church and State?</p>

Because that many consciencious men that have hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to Ceremonies and Episcopacy, have done it upon this ground, as supposing that Authority did not make them matters of vvorship, but of Order and Decencie, &amp;c.

By the Divine Bishop, he meanes the Bishop as he is taken in Scripture, which is one and the same with a Presbyter. By the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bishop he meanes the Bishop chosen by the Presbyters to be President over them, and to rule with them by fixed Lawes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. By the Diabolical Bishop, he means a Bishop with sole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Ordination and Jurisdiction, Lording it over Gods heritage, and governing by his owne will and authority. Which puts us in minde of the Painter that Limned two pictures to the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and figure; The one he reserved in secret, the other he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to common view. And as the phansie of beholders led them to censure any line or proportion, as not done to the life, he mends it after direction: If any fault be found with the eye, hand, foot, &amp;c. He corrects it, till at last the addition of every mans fancy had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced the first figure, and made that which was the Picture of a man, swell into a monster: Then bringing forth this and his other Picture which hee had reserved, he presented both to the people. And they abhorring the former, and applauding the latter, he cried, <hi>Hunc populus fecit:</hi> This deformed one the People made: This lovely one I made. As the Painter of his Painting, so (in <hi>Beza</hi>'s sense) it may be said of Bishops, God at first instituted Bishops, such as are all one with Presbyters; and such are amiable, honourable in all the Churches of God. But when men would be adding to Gods institution, what power, preheminence, Jurisdiction, Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness their phansie suggested unto them, this divine Bishop lost his Original beauty, and became to be <hi>Humanus.</hi> And in conclusion (by these and other aditions swelling into a Pope) <hi>Diabolicus.</hi>

And if so, then it much concernes all those that desire the purity of the Church, to consider, how neere the Discipline of the Church of England borders upon Antichrist;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:38504:39"/>
lest, while they endeavour to keep out Antichrist from entring by the door of doctrine, they should suffer him secretly to creep in by the door of Discipline, especially considering, what is here said in this Booke, That by their own confession <hi>the Discipline of the Church of England is the same with the Church of Rome.</hi>

                  <p>How it comes to pass, that in <hi>England</hi> there is such increase of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Popery, Superstition, Arminianism, and prophaneness, more then in other Reformed Churches? Doth not the root of these Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders proceed from the Bishops and their adherents, being forced to hold correspondencie with <hi>Rome,</hi> to uphold their greatness, and their Courts and Canons, wherein they symbolize with <hi>Rome?</hi> And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not to be feared, that they will rather consent to the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of Popery, for the upholding of their dignities, then part with their dignities for the upholding of Religion?</p>
                  <p>Why should <hi>England</hi> that is one of the chiefest King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> in <hi>Europe,</hi> that separates from Antichrist, maintain and defend a Discipline different from all other Reformed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which stand in the like Separation?

                  <p>Whether it be fit that the name Bishop, which in Scripture is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> common to the Presbyters with the Bishops (and not only in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but also in Antiquity for some hundreds of yeers) should still be appropriated to Bishops, and ingrossed by them, and not rather to be made common to all Presbyters; and the rather because?</p>

            <p>The violent opposition of the Popish Bishops, which made <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> write to King <hi>Edward</hi> in his Book <hi>de Regno Christi, lib.</hi> 2 <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and say, Your Majesty doth see, that this restoring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Kingdom of Christ, which we require, yea, which the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of us all requireth, may in no wise be expected to come from the Bishops, seeing there be so few among them which do understand the power and proper Offices of this Kingdom; and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many of them by all means (which possibly they can and dare) either oppose themselves against it, or defer and hinder.</p>
            <p>The deficiency of zeal and courage even in those Bishops who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> afterwards proved Martyrs, witness the sharp contention of <hi>Ridley</hi> against <hi>Hooper</hi> for the ceremonies.
