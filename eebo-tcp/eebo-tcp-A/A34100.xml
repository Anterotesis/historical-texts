            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SEVERALL CONSIDERATIONS,
Offered to the Parliament concerning the improvement of
Trade, Navigation, and Comerce, more especially,
the old draperies and other woolen manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
of England: by G. C. a Louer, of his country.</head>
            <p>WHereas in former ages, the subjects of <hi>England,</hi> lived cheifely by pasturage
and tillage, they were necessitated, to transport their wooles, to bring in
bullion, and other comodities, for their support, and pleasures. But after the
invention of gunns and gunpouder. Shipping, &amp; marriners, inereasing soe much in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
parts (from the product of English woole) both in number and strenght;
<hi>England</hi> could not be defended any longer, with bows and arrowes, wherefore they sligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
many old castles, and trusted to new Shipps, and even at last to thinke upon trade and
comerce, which proved the cheifest fortress, and support <hi>of the King and Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the dissolution of Monasteries and Abbies, the people multiplying soe fast,
they setled severall Colonies, and plantations in <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> finding noe roome
at home, for all yonger brothers to live, and gett estates. Diverse of them, that were
naturally adicted to the warrs, left the service of other <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>States</hi> (where English
men sell their skinns, and spinn out their lives, for <hi>brass stivers, and sols marques)</hi> to see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
their fortunes in those Dominions, that were added to the Crowne, through the great
charges and industry of severall well affected persons (to their <hi>King and Country)</hi> who
since have not only lost their reall possessions, but their originall costs, by bad go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment,
and worse conducts.</p>
            <p>When the staple of woole was kept at <hi>Midleburgh, <hi>in Richard the seconds</hi>
               </hi> time, and
at <hi>Callais,</hi> in <hi>Edward the thirds time,</hi> it was ordained, that for every sack of woole,
which should be transported out of <hi>England,</hi> there should be a competent quantity of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
bullion returned, besides 50<hi>s.</hi> a sack for custome outwards to <hi>the King.</hi> And to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all manner of fraudes in those days, there were severall offices of the staple errected
at <hi>West-minster, New-castle, Yorke, Lincolne, Canterbury, Excester, Bristoll,</hi>
and other places, soe that, a fleece of woole, could not be exported, without account to
<hi>the King,</hi> and a returne to the <hi>Kingdome.</hi> The tenth parte of all wooles being to come
to the church, their officers served the <hi>Crowne gratis,</hi> for the benefitts they received of
maintenance, and protection, which may be done, now by Parochiall, and Secular
persons, as was then by Regulars, without any charge to the crowne.</p>
            <p>It is the Custome in <hi>England</hi> for the cheifest lords in <hi>Parliament,</hi> to sitt upon woole packs,
to put them in minde of the naturall groweth of their estates, and the best dependance
of the Crowne, and the comon wealth.</p>
            <p>A pack of English woole containing 100. waight, Exceeds in value a pack of the finest
flax, Goates haire, or the finest filke, of the same waight, as farr as 100. waight
of English Tin, or lead, Exceeds 100. waight of Hollands turfe, digged out of their silver
Mines. In regard English woole, is of that absolute necessity to most nations of the world,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103811:2"/>
for warmth, and cloathing, when the other is for pleasure and delight. 100. waight of
fine flax, mohaire, or silke, may sett as many people at worke, as a pack of woole, but
it is not universally of the tenth parte, for use of apparell, or consumption. And the one
being of English groweth, and the other fforraigne, the woole adds to the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and
the other deminisheth.</p>
            <p>100. Pore men, women, and children, are usually imployed, and sett at worke by
every 100. waight of English woole (viz) <hi>Combers, Spinners, Reelers, Weavors,
Kintters, Dyers, Cloathworkers, Rowers, Fullers, Labourers,</hi> &amp;c. That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes

Dornick hangings, Ratines, Bays, Drugetts, &amp;c. Which canot be wrought alone
with their short staple wooles.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Kings of France,</hi> originally granted liberty, and priviledges, to all nations that
would come, and inhabite <hi>Flanders, Brabant, &amp;c.</hi> Whereupon, those great, &amp; populous Citties
and townes, were suddanly built by strangers, of all arts and sciences. And many of
their best Churches, Monasteries, and Abbies, were founded, and erected, by <hi>Severall Kings</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> and noble men in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time; As the records of <hi>Flanders,</hi> makes appeare,
Amongst which, there is a very remarkable History. <hi>The Queene of France</hi> in her progress,
coming to vissit <hi>Brugis</hi> and <hi>Gant,</hi> she found, the people soe richly cloathed, that she sayd
she thought, there had been but one <hi>Queene in France,</hi> but there she found all the women
<hi>Queens,</hi> and wished she had been a Cloathiers wife also, most of the inhabitants, being
Cloathiers, Weavors, and others, that lived upon the manufacture of English woole,
which soe increased their wealth, and beauty, to wonder, and admiration.</p>
            <p>Afterwards by severall acts of Providence, many thousand <hi>Weavors, Felt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,
Knitters, and Spinners,</hi> transported themselves for <hi>England,</hi> when the great
Councell of the land, had prohibited the transportation of woole, and incouraged the
woolen manufactures at home. Then a Charter was granted to the Marchant adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers,
who maintained severall persons, in all the sea Port townes of <hi>England, France</hi>
and <hi>Flanders,</hi> to make seizures, and discoveries, of all wooles, and fullers Earth, that
should be conveyed out of his <hi>Majesties</hi> Dominions, to fforraigne parts; But since the

            <head>CONSIDERATIONS
Of the Advantages, which the <hi>King of great Brittaigne,</hi> and his
subjects, may draw by the opening of the navigation, in
the River of the Scheld, to the citty of <hi>Antwerpe.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THere is nothing of more importance to the united Provinces, then navigation, by which
they doe not only subsist, but are inriched, and render themselves formidable to all
the Princes, and Potentates of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to the prejudice of all their neighbours, and their owne great profit, they draw to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
the Comerce of the whole world, as well in respect of the sale of goods, in their owne
Country, as of what they distribue unto others.</p>
            <p>And although their Comerce seeme to be interrupted, and deminished by this warr, yet that is
only for a time, since that as sone as they shall have peace, they will imeadiatly setle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
againe, in the trade, to the Exclusion of all other nations.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the only means to weaken the states, and to divert this inundation
of trade (that swells amongst them) without any effusion of bloud, or expence of
his Majesties subjects. It being a Sure and easie conquest, which is gott by peace.
A ffree Passage ought to be procured, for his Majesties subjects and their Shipps in
