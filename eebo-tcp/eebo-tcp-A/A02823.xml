            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y deare PARTHENIANS,
When the Sauiour of the world
had passed the Torrent of <hi>Cedron,</hi>
into the Garden of <hi>Gethsemani,</hi>
there to commence the Tragedie,
whose sad Catastrophe he was to finish on
Mount <hi>Caluarie,</hi> he gaue to vnderstand, how
much (no doubt) he was pleased with <hi>Gardens.</hi>
But then especially, after the Tragick Scene was
ended, and that doleful curten or veyle was rent
asunder (a token of the period of the Iewish
Theater) when al was voyded, and he vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
to appeare familiarly againe to his deerest
friends, in the forme and habit of a <hi>Gardener,</hi> he
euidently declared his good affection, towards
the <hi>Garden</hi> of their Soules, which then he came to
<pb facs="tcp:4067:4"/>
cheer-vp and refresh with his Diuine presence,
&amp; to banish the clowdes of heauines, which so sad
a spectacle had cast vpon the Garden of their
harts, when as no flowers or functions of their
soules could chearfully yeald their luster, or send
forth anie special odour of sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctitie, so drowned in
teares. May it not therefore seeme strange vnto
you, if I, knowing the sympathie of harts,
between the Mother and the Sonne, the Blessed
IESVS, flower of Nazareth, and his sacred
Stem, presume heer to personate, and make her
appeare to your viewes, not in the habit of fashion
of a Gardener, which office she rather yealds (as
proper) to her Sonne, but of a <hi>Garden,</hi> vnder the
veyle of Symbols, to deliciate a while with her
Deuotes, You, deerest Parthenians, yet greeued

from the beginning planted the same for himself,
from al Eternitie. Now then the winter past of
melancholie thoughts, the showers blowne-ouer
and quite vanished, of teares of persecution; I say,
laying the memorie of them al aside, as stormes
already past, in conceit at least, you heer behold
our SACRED PARTHENES, who presents her
self for your delights in Garden-attire and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
receaue her, with serene browes, in this
coorse and rural array, of hearbes and flowers, as
if she were clothed with the Sunne, crowned
with the Starres, and trampling the Moone, as
<pb facs="tcp:4067:4"/>
once she was seen by her holie Guardian, the
deare Disciple, whom IESVS loued. Nor
would I wish you perfunctoriously to view her
only, and passe her ouer with a slender glance
of the eye, but to enter into her <hi>Garden,</hi> which she
is herself, and suruey it wel. Where, to the end
you may not erre, mistake, or goe astray, in wayes
so new, and strange, and (for ought I know) as
yet vntraced or trod of anie, take heer, I pray, for
Guide, my proper <hi>Genius,</hi> wel acquainted with al

in her, and with his most exquisit fingars, hath
bestowed so much art and industrie in her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neation,
and so pleased himself with the delicat
draughts he hath shewed in this one image of
himself, as if in the shop of human things he
would expose her to all, to be imitated. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when as that Soule, farre purer then the
Starres, and flowing with so manie exquisit
ornaments, glided into the Tabernacle of her
<pb facs="tcp:4067:7"/>
bodie, that impure Firebrand was not cast into
her, which first was kindled in the Authours of
our kind, and flamed forth afterwards farre and
wide, to the waste and vtter ruine of the whole
world, but as a Saphyr or purer Adamant, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
and growes vp in pure and burnisht gold: so
a most chast Soule, by the hands of God dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
so therof, was put into her inuiolable
and sanctified bodie, that no least stayne of her
stock and progenie might light vpon her. Then,
after. SHE (that golden issue of her Mother)
was borne and brought forth to light, I easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that Nature recreated and refreshed from
the daylie miserie it lay in, euen laughed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
her, supposing the light was newly risen to
her, when first she fixt her eyes on her, from
whose precious and Virginal womb, was the
Fountain of light itself to spring. The Virgin-infant
heervpon was nursed-vp and trayned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twen
chast walls, in a most holie discipline of
Patrial lawes, and instructed with those studies
of arts, that might addresse her as a noble
Sacrarie of God. Anticipating vertue, she
vrged and pressed more hard the flower paces
of her years, which hardly could endure the
long demurres of age, of vhom was Nature
ashamed as it were to impose anie lawes of
longer attendance. For euen now in her first
age, there shined manie <hi>Dotes</hi> in her, as starres
in the heauens in a serene night, like sparkling
<pb facs="tcp:4067:8"/>
gemmes fixed in their orbs; since SHE had in her
whole life, as you know, a maruelous societie of al
Vertues, wherewith SHE woue that loome of
her age, as with singular and most excellent
figures, in whom the absolute consent and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of al Vertues haue magnificently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired,
that Beautie should not violate Shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnes;
grauitie, infringe lowlines; meekenes,
grauitie; Simplicitie, Maiestie; facilitie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie;
lastly (which til then was neuer heard
of) that the name of <hi>Mother</hi> should be nothing
iniurious to <hi>Virginitie.</hi> Al Vertues stroue alike in
HER, and al had the victorie. Nor yet was SHE de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiture
of the guifts of Nature likewise, while a
certain Diuinitie of beautie dazeled the aspects
of men.<note place="margin">So Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius very nigh des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes her,</note> The bashful forhead (seate of sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnes)
soft and gently arose; beneath the
black and archie browes, shined forth the bright
lamps of HER eyes, which how powerfully they
pierced and penetrated the heauens, who
knowes not? The nose most gracefully inflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
made a handsome kind of pillaster to her
forhead; lips somewhat thinner, the recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of a meeke elocution, and celestial gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
a great affabilitie of speach; a singular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie
of gate; a countenance, graceful with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
softnes or leuitie, graue without statelines,
set alwayes in a perpetual sereanes, which
hardly could admit the least impression of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
It were long to prosecute the rest; I shal
<pb facs="tcp:4067:8"/>
haue sayd al things, saying, SHE is the MOTHER
of GOD. But this dignitie when al the tongues,
I say not of men only, but euen of the Angels
themselues, shal proclaime and set forth, doe

before you; and if you mark it wel, you shal discerne
that domestical and almost inseparable companion
therof, the HEN, there scraping in the dust for food,
wherin She finds a precious Margarit or PEARL;
and on the top therof espy an innocent and meek
DOVE, as white and candid, as the driuen snow;
for in this GARDEN are al things pure. Where

            <p>But soft, my <hi>Genius;</hi> ere thou leade thy Reader
into the Maze or Labyrinth of the beauties therin
contained, pause heer a while, to consider how to
behaue thy self, before (I say) thou let him in, to
speculate that Magazin of beauties; which
being so mysterious and delicious an Obiect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
not to be rashly lookt vpon, or perfuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
to be slighted ouer, but, as the manner is
of such as enter into a Garden, to glance at first
<pb facs="tcp:4067:10"/>
theron with a light regard, then to reflect vpon
it with a better heed, to find some gentle mysterie
or conceipt vpon it, to some vse or other; and
then liking it better, to reuiew the same againe,
and so to make a Suruey thervpon to the same
vse. This would I haue thee punctually obserue
in al, to guide thy Reader with, in this present
GARDEN of our sacred PARTHENES. First
then shalt thou presente him with the Symbol it
self, set-forth in manner of a <hi>Deuise,</hi> with an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prese</hi>
and <hi>Motto,</hi> expressing the allusion to the
SACRED PARTHENES herself, in some mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
of hers, or attribute belonging to her. Then
shalt thou take the <hi>Imprese</hi> being the Symbol by
itself, and dallie as it were with some natural
and apt <hi>Character</hi> vpon it; being no more, then
certain superficial Glances, deciphering it in some
sort, but lightly only, for a first entertainment of
thy <hi>Reader.</hi> The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with <hi>Morals,</hi> on the <hi>Motto,</hi> shalt thou but
touch or reflect vpon the <hi>Paragon</hi> herself for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and no more. Then looking back with a fresh
reuiew on the Symbol itself, by way of an <hi>Essay,</hi>
shalt thou make a fuller <hi>Suruey</hi> therof, discoursing
on the <hi>Paragon</hi> herself, to match compare, and
paralel them togeather, to find out some <hi>Elogies</hi> or
other, in prayse of our SACRED PARTHENES.
Thence to satisfy the Eye as wel as the Vnderstanding,
for his greater delight, thou shalt
pause a while, to leade him to behold, as in a Tapestrie,
the Symbol turned into an <hi>Embleme,</hi> piously
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>posed; where for the clearer vnderstanding therof,
the same shal be indicatiuely expressed in a <hi>Poesie,</hi>
made for the purpose. Then shalt thou make him sit
downe a while, to ponder, consider, and conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plate
some things besides, conducing to the further dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4067:11"/>
of the hidden mysterie, contained in the
Symbol itself, to the honour of our SACRED
PARTHENES, as certain <hi>Speculations</hi> or <hi>Theories</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And after al, shalt thou inuite him to Apostro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phize

the Symbol so handled, being the vtmost scope,
and ful fruition of the whole; and so conclude the

Cast but your eyes a little on those
goodlie Allies, as sowed al ouer with
sands of gold, drawne-forth so streight by a line.
Those Cros-bowes there (be not affrayed of them)
they are but Cros-bowes made of Bayes; and the
Harquebusiers, wrought in Rosmarie, shoot but flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and dart forth musk. Those Beasts likewise, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
there and dreadful to see to, are but in ieast; al
that menace they make, is but a shew only. Al those
armed Men with greenish weapons, and those Beasts
al clad in skins of green, are but of Prim, Isop, and
Tyme, al hearbs very apt to historify withal. I wil
quite passe ouer those little Groues, Thickets, and
Arbours, and speake nothing of those Pety-canons
there and Quiristers, chanting their Complines in
the Euening, and Nocturnes in the Night, mingling
their prettie Mottets, which Nature learnes them, of
their owne accord. Nor wil I heer speake a word of
those Water-works, Conduits, and Aquaducts, which
yet might you heare to make a gentle murmur
throughout, affording an apt Base for the birds to
descant on. I hast me to the Flowers only most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to our GARDEN heer. Behold, I pray, those
Bushes, al enameled with ROSES of so manie sorts;
these heer apparrelled with the white of Innocencie;
those there with a scarlet tincture; one wel-nigh
withered embalmes the ayre with its perfume, and
makes a shew with its golden threads, and al
its treasure; that other is yet in its folds, and dares
<pb facs="tcp:4067:13"/>
not hazard so much as to peepe forth; this heer puts
forth the bud, and now half-open smiles withal, and
shewes forth a glimps of its purple, through a cliff
of the green Cafe, wherein it is; which the theeuish
birds would soone come to steale away, were it not
for the Garrison of thornes, that serues for a Corps<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de-guard
to that Queene of flowers. Behold there the
Lillies of ten sorts; some yet hidden in their green
cups; others half borne; and the rest newly disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
What think you? are they not exceeding faire?
You would say, they were of white Satin, streaked
without, and al embroadered within with gold; you
can hardly tel, whether they be milk condensed into
leaues, or figured snow, or siluer flower-de-lis'd, or
a starre al musked. Those yellow ones, would you
not verily think them to be golden bels? and that
red one, a little purse of crimson-satin? and those
others, some goodlie vessels of Emeralds, or the
like? But marke a while; see you not those beds
strewed with a thousand <hi>Violets?</hi> some yellow, some
purple, some white, some speckled, and some party-couloured,
some Carnashion, and some changeable.
Behold those faire and beautiful Tulips there; those
rich Amaranths, cerulean Hiacinths, Pansies, the
gemmes of the goodlie IRIS; the scarlet Gillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower,
the Pinks, the Marygolds, and a thousand
other flowers. O what a Paradice of flowers is this!
What a Heauen of muskie starres, or Celestial Earth
al starred with flowers, empearled with gemmes and
precious stones! A land of promise, ful of milk and
honie! Behold, I say, the ROSE, dedicated (they
say) to that little elf <hi>Cupid;</hi> whose threads are as
golden hayres; whose thornes in steed of arrowes;
whose fire, a flash of luster; and whose leaues are
wings; few can touch it, without touch of loue
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4067:14"/>
vnto it; and it costs them deare, who meddle with it.
The LILLIE hangs the head downe; for modestie, I
suppose; though it can not blush, for hauing nothing
to blush at; her flower being al so white and without
spot. They say, She was borne of the milk of <hi>Iuno;</hi>
howsoeuer she is called the Royal flower, the <hi>Rose of
Iuno.</hi> Note there the humilitie of the VIOLET, how
like to the strawberrie she keeps by the ground,
hiding, what she can, her beautie in her leaues, but is
discouered whether she wil or no; partly by the
flashes of her luster, breaking forth vnawares
betweene the leaues, not so reserued as they ought;
and partly with the odour she can not choose but
send forth. The Tulip is a singular ornament to this
Garden; looke and obserue it wel. How were it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
one would think, so thin a leaf, bred and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
in the same ayre, and proceeding from the
same stem, should be golden in the bottome, violet
without, saffron within, bordered on the edge with
fine gold, and the prickle of the point blew as a
goodlie Saphir? and a hundred others of seueral
fashions, as if they had striuen to dresse themselues to
put the eyes into paine, not knowing where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow

the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> whereof <hi>S. Augustin</hi> sayth thus: The

is an oderiferous tree, and the <hi>Nard</hi> a most humble
hearb. There was <hi>Nard</hi> and <hi>Saffron,</hi> to wit, feruent
Charitie, and Humilitie of Celestial Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
because the <hi>Nard</hi> is a hot hearb; and <hi>Saffron</hi>

withal the trees of <hi>Libanus;</hi> because in her was a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
puritie of Conscience, an excellent odour
of good Fame, and Incorruptibilitie of the flesh.
For the <hi>Cane</hi> hath its vertue in the pith; the <hi>Cinamon</hi>
hath its odour in the bark; and the wood of <hi>Libanus</hi>
is incorruptible: And lastly was there both <hi>Mirrh</hi>

was bitternes of tribulation for her Sonne's passion,
the bitternes of compassion for the affliction of

cheeres and glads the eyes of al with its glorious

also, which is the death of the said <hi>Rose,</hi> what an
odour it hath with it, euen after it hath been perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted

multiplied her fauours to man-kind, especially after
she was translated thence, and had been proued and

but thorns. For what should
thorns conceaue but meerly thorns?
Corrupt mothers bring forth into
the world but men, which meerly are
but men and sinners. But the <hi>Virgin-Mother</hi>
conceaued the Holie of Holies. <hi>She</hi> now a <hi>Lillie</hi>
conceaued, and afterwards produced the <hi>true Lillie of
the vallies;</hi> a Lillie of Virginitie, the Lillie of Maiestie:
through whose candour is darknes expelled; with
whose odour, are raysed the dead; with whose touch,
are the leaprous cleansed, and al the infirme and
diseased cured. And therefore how much this <hi>Lillie</hi>
of ours, is to be exalted aboue al the other Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
iudge you, and ponder it wel.</p>
               <p>Consider then, that though there were manie other
Virgins besides, conspicuons and eminent for sanctitie,
yet were as thorns; for that they had some ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
in them; since, howbeit they were pure in
themselues, yet the <hi>fomes</hi> of sinne was not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
in them; who were indeed as thorns to
others, that haue been touched and incited with
concupiscence towards them. Wheras the <hi>Virgin-Mother</hi>
was wholy priuiledged from al guilt, in whom
was that <hi>fomes</hi> altogeather extinguished, and was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
with so intense a Chastitie, that with
her inestimable Virginal puritie, she so penetrated
the harts of the beholders, as she could not be coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of anie; but for the time rather extinguished
al lust of concupiscence in them. O beautie of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie

               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:4067:27"/>
Ponder lastly, that as the <hi>Lillie</hi> hath a most effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
vertue against leaprosie, vlcers, and the holie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire,
as also against the stinging of serpents: So the
<hi>blessed Virgin</hi> being conceaued as a <hi>Lillie,</hi> was endued
with such vertue of the Diuine grace, that neither the

with whom, when she is disposed, she wil

enamel, and to make the delicatnes of his
pencil shine therin, and the fairest cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of the world, to border the mantle
of the Spring withal. There are some purple, but with
the finest purple; some as snow, fashioned into litle

<hi>Argent</hi> leaues, al sowen thick with little odoriferous
starres: Others are of <hi>Ore musked,</hi> or of <hi>Violcts</hi> meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphosed
into most sweet gold, cut into blossomes.
There are some deckt with a hundred and a hundred
leaues neatly fitted togeather, and al as grafted into
one stemme, which casting themselues into a round
and folding within one another through a sweet
oeconomie, agree to frame and compose a very dayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and delicious <hi>Violet,</hi> as faire as sweet, mingling,
with a gentle confusion, a thousand coulours, which
simpathize exceeding wel, and glad the eye. Behold
the <hi>Violet</hi> of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April; May</hi> and <hi>Iune</hi> haue theirs
a-part, being of a changeable coulour, hauing the top
and edge of purple, white in the midst, and guilded
beneath in the bottome. What a maruelous enamel
to see the <hi>argent,</hi> the <hi>purple,</hi> the <hi>Ore,</hi> and <hi>azure</hi> of the

a litle green tuft, from a litle sprig, with a string, that
serues as a pipe for Nature to distil her musks, that
breathe from thence. The leaues are somewhat
round in their peering forth, and iagged; and then
after extend they in length, and spread themselues.
Their great vertue comes from a litle fire wel tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered

think might follow wel in <hi>Our Ladyes Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
as an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Type or Symbol of her.
It is flower wel knowne to al, familiar and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
with al Nations. For where haue you a Garden,
that hath not store of them? yea the woods togeather
with the Primrose seeme to be as strewed with
them as tapistryes; they are so diapred al-ouer with
those flowers. And our glorious VIRGIN is as easie
and familiar to approach vnto, as it. The honour
of this <hi>Violet,</hi> is in the Spring; or rather is the <hi>Violet,</hi>
the honour of the Spring. Because the hoarie &amp; hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Winter now passed ouer, and the rigid frosts and
snowes dissolued, the pleasant season of the Spring
returning, the Earth seemes to put forth the <hi>Violet,</hi>
as the <hi>primitias</hi> of flowers, togeather with the
Primrose her inseparable companion, to welcome
it with; a hastie present indeed, but yet a rare one.
The spring of Grace so appearing, and opening the
breast, after so tedious a Winter ouerpast, of horrid
Sinne and frozen Infidelitie, our MARIE the <hi>Violet,</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:4067:30"/>
or the <hi>Violet-Marie</hi> rather, is put forth, as a ioyful
present to glad the time withal.</p>
               <p>This flower I find now to affect the hils and
mountains, though there want no store and plentie
of them in the plaines and vallies also; and, as gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
vse to say, it loues to be transplanted to and
fro. And so our <hi>Violet</hi> heer was no lesse transplanted
in her <hi>Visitation,</hi> when she <hi>Rifing vp, went hastily into the
mountains.</hi> For loe, this <hi>Violet</hi> sprung at first and grew
in the vallies, to wit, of herself; but was then trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
and remoued into the mountain of Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to the mountain of Glorie, mountain of
Fame, Honour, and Exaltation: but yet was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
planted in the valley of Humilitie. A strange
thing truly, and more then a Garden-miracle, that
our <hi>Violet</hi> should stil remaine in the valley, and yet
be placed on a Mountain! yea the higher she was
exalted on the Mountain, the better she was rooted
in the Valley: both on the same Mountain, and in
the same Valley, at one and the self-same time.
Now, Philosopher, tel me, what would you more?
can not the same thing be in two places at once? It
may; MARIE on the Hil of exaltation, and the
self-same MARIE in the Valley of demission, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
therin the precept of the Wife-man: <hi>How

                  <note place="margin">Eccles.</note> 
                  <hi>do thou humble thyself in al.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now see, I pray, the haste the <hi>Violet</hi>
makes aboue al flowers, to entertaine the Spring;
and then to behold our <hi>Violet</hi> made to clime the
mountaines, would make you wonder, to see
her in such haste. For who would not admire to
see a tender Virgin, great with child, to fly from
the valley, ouer hils and dales, through thick
and thin, to the mountain-tops? But yet wonder
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4067:31"/>
not, while we dayly see great engins moued, and
that most swiftly too, by force of fire: GOD <hi>is our
consuming fire.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</note> This fire then the <hi>Virgin</hi> carried in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
She is stirred and excited with the blast of the
Holie-Ghost, vnto offices of pietie. The fire breaks
forth; what maruel then, if it carries so the engine of
the bodie with it? I say, what maruel, while the Spirit
of GOD, whose Symbol is Fire, carries her so fast
through publick places, to shun the aspect of men (so
contrarie to the inclination of Virginal modestie) to
hide herself in the house of her <hi>Cosen?</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Violet,</hi> as the Rose also, being planted neer the

as the vngrateful sent of the one, giues a sweeter

plants it neer vnto them, to haue it send forth a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

<hi>Heliotropion</hi> or <hi>Flower of the Sun;</hi> be it for
the height of its stem, approaching to
the heauens some cubits high; or beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the flower, being as big as a man's head, with
a faire ruff on the neck; or, for the number of the
leaues, or yellow, vying with the marigold; or, which
is more, for al the qualities, nature, and properties
of the Flower, which is to wheel about with the Sun;
there being no Needle, that more punctually regards
the Poles, then doth this <hi>Flower</hi> the glorious <hi>Sun.</hi> For
in the morning it beholds his rising; in his iourney,
attends vpon him; and eyeth him stil, wheresoeuer
he goes; nor euer leaues following him, til he sink
downe ouer head and eares in <hi>Tethis's</hi> bed, when
not being able to behold him anie longer she droops
and languishes, til he arise; and then followes him
againe to his old lodging, as constantly as euer; with
him it riseth, with him it falles, and with him
riseth againe. Nature hath donne wel in not
affording it anie odour at al; for with so much
beautie and admirable singularities, had there
been odour infused therinto, and the sweetnesse
of odoriferous flowers withal, euen men, who
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4067:35"/>
are now half mad in adoring the same for its excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
guifts, would then haue been stark mad indeed,
with doting vpon it. But Nature, it seemes, when first
she framed a pattern for the rest, not being throughly
resolued, what to make it, tree or flower, hauing
brought her workmanship almost vnto the top, after
a litle pause perhaps, at al aduenture put a flower
vpon it, and so for haste, forgot to put the Musks into
it. Whervpon, to countervaile her neglect heerin,
the benigne <hi>Sol,</hi> of meer regard and true compassion,
graced her by his frequent and assiduous looke with
those golden rayes it hath. And as the Sun shewes
himself to be enamoured with her, she, as reason
would, is no lesse taken with his beautie, and by her
wil (if by looks we may guesse of the wil) would
faine be with him. But like an Estrich, with its leaues
as wings, it makes vnprofitable offers, to mount vp
vnto him, and to dwel with him; but being tyed by
the root, it doth but offer, and no more. It is like the

that beares an Eye on the top; while this flower is
nothing els but an Eye, set on the point of its stem;
not to regard the affayres of Mortals so much, as to
eye the Immortal Sunne with its whole propension;
the midle of which flower, where the seed is, as the
white of the eye, is like a Turkie-carpet, or some finer
cloth wrought with curious needle-work, which is
al she hath to entertaine her Paramour.</p>

before them al; that trauerses al places, this pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates

The <hi>Sun,</hi> the Planet, is the origin of life, the <hi>Sun of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi>
life itself; that is soueraignly visible, this most
soueraignly intelligible. In the <hi>Sun of Planets,</hi> is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes,

the vertue of plants and flowers, the perfection of

               <p>Hence it is, that GOD makes so great accompt of

the world, who is the graine of mustard-seed, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
this same rich drop of <hi>Deaw.</hi> For as the <hi>Sonne</hi> of
<hi>God</hi> in outward apparance was, as it were, no bodie,
nor seemed to make anie shew, yet when the <hi>Sun of

himself to be the vertue of Paradice, euen so a little

and Mother of vs al, was not created
immediatly of earth,<note place="margin">The Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</note> as <hi>Adam</hi> was, but
taken from his rib (it being a priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
only due to <hi>Adam,</hi> so to be framed
of virgin-earth) and was therefore called <hi>Virago,</hi> fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
her extraction as it were <hi>a Viro:</hi> So our second
<hi>Eue,</hi> our Spiritual and Celestial <hi>Mother,</hi> adopting vs,
&amp; engendring vs as children, through the <hi>Deawes</hi> of
Celestial graces procured vs from heauen, was not
made of virgin-extraction herself, that is, was not
framed of the Diuine or Angelical nature, as a <hi>Deaw</hi>
exhaled from the virgin-element of waters, but of
the pure human nature, as drawn from the mixt, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and brackish waues of the Sea, by that great <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect</hi>
of heauen, the <hi>Sun of Iustice,</hi> giuing her the name
of MARIA, to wit, <hi>a mari amaritudinis,</hi> as it were,
fetcht from the Ocean of bitternes of human kind.
And now with her graces and fauours, as <hi>Deawes</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
from heauen, perpetually doth nothing, but
showre downe vpon her children and Deuotes.</p>
               <p>Consider then, how our <hi>Ladie</hi> became as a marine
<hi>Coucha,</hi> or Oyster of the Sea, which opens itself to
receaue the <hi>heauenlie Deaw</hi> into her <hi>Lap,</hi> that so the
precious Gemme might be engendred in it, which
when it hath receaued once, it closeth vp againe, not
to loose so precious a <hi>depositum,</hi> til it be fairely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
and brought forth in time prefixed. Euen so
our incomparable <hi>Ladie,</hi> the precious vessel of so
heauenlie and Diuine a <hi>Deaw,</hi> hauing once conce aued
the same within her virginal Womb, retires herself
into her <hi>Nazareth,</hi> to ruminate on the mysterie she
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4067:43"/>
had within her, vntil necessitie drew her to <hi>Bethleem</hi>
and the time prefixed of the deliuerie of her <hi>fruit</hi> was
come; for then as purely as she receaued it, she gaue
it vp most perfect and compleat, and made therof a
rich present to the world.</p>
               <p>Ponder lastly, how the <hi>Deaw</hi> being a meer extract
from the Seas, exhaled by the vertue of the Sunnie
rayes, which when he can hold no longer, lets it fal to
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort and refresh al fublunarie things, and drawing
it againe vnto himself, lets it fal againe for the same
end; and so wil do, to the end of the world, for the
comfort and solace of man-kind. So the humanitie
of our <hi>Sauiour Christ,</hi> as a waterie <hi>Deaw,</hi> being extrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the virgin <hi>Marie (amaro mari</hi>) and through
the Sunnie rayes of the Diuinitie assumpted vp to
heauen in the glorious <hi>Ascension,</hi> through loue not
able to stay any longer, descends againe in the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Sacrament,</hi> to recreate and refresh vs Mortals, &amp;
so as often as we desire, is readie to visit vs with his

delighted with these things: first, with faire &amp; serene
weather; for then those deawes more plentifully fal &amp;
are more delicious: and of the contrarie in the raynie
&amp; more boysterous weather they are wholy hindered
from their vintage, as it were, or gathering those su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred
deawes. Secondly, they are pleased much with
abundance of flowers; from whence they gather
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4067:47"/>
their purest honie; for though the deawes fal vpon
the leaues, and they gather it no doubt from them
also, yet is it not so delicious and pure; for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of deawes participats much of the places they
light on, which makes the <hi>Bee</hi> farre more busie and
industrious on the flower, then on the leaues. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they are wonne with a sweet sound. For <hi>Aristotle</hi>
sayth, they are exceedingly allured with the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of musick and sweet sounds; which we ordinarily
practise now adayes, to stay them with, when they
are in a great consult to take their flight and be gone;
for then with the striking of a pan only insteed of
other musick are they brought to settle themselues
neer home; so Musical they are. And lastly, they ioy
greatly insweet wine, as we find by experience and
daylie practise, as often as they begin to swarme, &amp;
are now on the wing and point to trauel into forren
parts.</p>
               <p>Al these things the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> was exceedingly
affected to, and had them al, as it were, within her;
as first a serenitie in the internal conscience, where
appeared no clowd in the ayre of her Mind, and
where the pacifical <hi>Salomon</hi> sat peacefully indeed as
in his Iuorie Throne. <hi>Al the glorie of the King's daughter,
was wholy within her.</hi> Then had she the flowers of al
Vertues and Graces within <hi>her,</hi> to wit, the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of al vertues, the <hi>lillies</hi> of <hi>chastitie,</hi> the blush and

and Diuine loue of the <hi>Heliotropion,</hi> and the like. <hi>Her</hi>

Paradise, which had the Archangel as Paranimph &amp;
Guardian therof, with the two-edged sword of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie
and the chast Feare of God. O delicious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,
and more then terrestrial, euen when she was
dwelling on the earth! Thirdly she was affected to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4067:47"/>
Musick, and very rare and singular therin, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
by that excellent and melodious Canticle of <hi>hers,</hi>

world, and taken-vp in the <hi>Church,</hi> for an admirable
peece of that Art, to vye with the Angels, the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins,
and Seraphins themselues, to frame the like.
Nor yet was <hi>she</hi> so pleased, to heare herself sing only,
as to listen to her <hi>Spouse, the voice of her beloued knocking</hi>
and saying: <hi>My sister, open vnto me;</hi> to whom she would
answer againe: <hi>Behold, my beloued speaks vnto me.</hi> Oh <hi>let
thy voice stil sound in mine eares!</hi> and a thousand other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of her Musical hart would <hi>she</hi> dayly sing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
to the Angelical troups, which enuironed her
round. And lastly for her loue to wine, that is, to
the Angelical Nectar, <hi>she</hi> was dayly feasted with, of
spiritual gladnes, as tasts before hand, of her fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ioyes, which might appeare by the quantitie
<hi>she</hi> tooke of those wines, and the qualitie againe by

remaining in her Closet, as we may piously beleeue,

               <p>But especially indeed is the blessed <hi>Virgin</hi> sayd to

no doubt is a singular prayse of the Virginal womb;

we receaue al the chiefest benefits of Nature, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the growth and prosperitie of plants, without
which nothing would succeed or come to anie thing:
so from this glorious <hi>Virgin-Mother</hi> we likely receaue
the most notable fauours &amp; guifts we haue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> GOD.
For as the <hi>Heauen</hi> visits the earth, affording its light by
day &amp; night, by meanes of the two great torches, Sun
and Moon, and millions of lesser lights, which with
their influe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces besides doe fructify the same, and with
their sweet showers in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner inebriate it, and coole
it againe, when need requires, with dryer clowds, yea
enrich it also, with gold, siluer, and precious stones: so
our incomparable <hi>Ladie</hi> visits and illustrats the whole
vniuersal <hi>Church</hi> with her admirable examples, and
with the guifts of the <hi>Holie-Ghost</hi> inebriats the same,
stores it abundantly with good works, and enriches
it with an infinit treasure of al vertues:<note place="margin">Psal.</note> and therefore
is it sayd: <hi>Thou hast visited the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ponder lastly, how among al things which haue anie
stuff, matter, or dimesion in them of length, breadth,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:4067:54"/>
or thicknes, there is no incorruptible thing to be
thought on, but only the <hi>heauens;</hi> for al mixt things,
whatsoeuer they be, corrupt at last, and the Elements
we see continually corrupt; saue only the Celestial
bodie, which is wholy incorruptible of its owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
So in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, whenas al the Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Adam,</hi>
begot according to Nature, are lyable, and obnoxious
to the corruption of Original sinne; and al women
loose in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceauing, the integritie of the bodie; yet this
<hi>Heauen</hi> of <hi>Marie,</hi> through especial grace &amp; prerogatiue
of her <hi>Sonne,</hi> was made incorruptible, according to
either part, of soule and bodie: Of the soule truly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tagion and corruption of Original sinne
touched not <hi>her</hi> so much as a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t only; &amp; of bodie
also, because though indeed <hi>she</hi> were a true &amp; natural
Mother, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaued <hi>her Sonne</hi> most truly indeed, yet
knew <hi>she</hi> no corruption at al, obseruing and keeping
perpetually, the Virginitie of mind and bodie. How

so strange and admirable incorruptibilitie in <hi>her?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Let vs see then, how this <hi>heauenlie Bow</hi> deciphers the
<hi>Queen of Heauen,</hi> this mirrour of Nature, and the asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of man-kind. The Generation and extract
of anie thing discouers it most. This <hi>Iris</hi> then or
<hi>Raynebow,</hi> is caused by the reflexion of the Sunnie
beames, vpon a lucid clowd, concaue and waterish.
Clowdes are engendred of the marine vapours or
exhalation of the seas, where the vapoural parts of
the Ocean are attracted by the vertue of the Sun;
which conglomerated togeather, engender a clowd,
when the brackishnes of the Sea-water is turned to
sweetnes. And so was our <hi>Ladie</hi> a true clowd, since in
<hi>her</hi> were found these marine vapours, that is, incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
tribulations, bitter and brackish of themselues,
though to <hi>her</hi> made sweet, through the force and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4067:57"/>
vertue of Diuine Loue. The Sunnie beames therefore,
that is, the grace of GOD being a ray, as it were, of
the Diuine Essence, reflecting on the purest <hi>Virgin,</hi> a
lucid clowd, concaue and waterish, produced the
<hi>Iris</hi> or <hi>Rainebow</hi> in the Hierarchie of the Church, as in
the firmament of the Heauens; and therefore called
the <hi>Iris</hi> or <hi>Celestial Bow,</hi> a signe of the Reconciliation
of GOD with al mankind. She was concaue through
humilitie, and therefore very apt to receaue the
rayes of the <hi>Sunne of Iustice,</hi> the influence of Diuine
graces; as she was waterish no lesse through compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and pietie, because <hi>her</hi> hart was a Spring, and <hi>her</hi>
eyes as continual-standing pooles of teares.</p>
               <p>A bow commonly hath a string, is bent with an
arrow in it, and hath the horns conuerted towards
vs, as menacing the Foes. Our <hi>Blessed Vigin</hi> is a <hi>Bow</hi>
indeed, but without the string of seueritie, because
most iust; and without menaces and feare, because
most sweet; and hath two horns withal, to wit, Grace
and Mercie, which <hi>she</hi> holdeth towards vs; while
grace <hi>she</hi> affordeth to the iust, and mercie to sinners,
and is therefore called the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Mother</hi>
of <hi>Mercie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Aboue al, the <hi>Rayne-bow</hi> hath its proper subsistence
in coulour, which it seemes to borrow (as <hi>Bede</hi> sayth)
of the foure Elements. For, of the fire it contracts a
ruddie coulour; from the water a Cerulean; from the
ayre, the coulour of the Hyacinth; and from the
earth, the green it hath: al which seeme spiritually
to be found in our <hi>Celestial Bow,</hi> the Incomparable
<hi>Ladie;</hi> for red <hi>she</hi> was, being wholy inflamed with the
fire of Diuine loue, which <hi>she</hi> tooke from the Diuine
fire, <hi>God being our consuming fire:</hi> a fire indeed, that
burns and consumes others, but not <hi>her;</hi> because al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<hi>she</hi> were a <hi>bush,</hi> and <hi>burning too;</hi> yet <hi>incombustible.</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:4067:58"/>
She might borrow that coulour likewise from <hi>her</hi>
dead <hi>Sonne,</hi> as <hi>he</hi> lay on <hi>her</hi> lap, being taken from the
Crosse, al bathed with his precious Bloud, which
mixed with <hi>her</hi> faire complexion, might wel appeare
like to flames, in our <hi>heauenlie Iris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She had the Cerulean, which is the coulour of the
Sea, because <hi>she</hi> is properly the <hi>Starre of the Sea,</hi> and
hath therefore a great correspondencie with that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid
Element; and through meer compassion, was
become, as it were; al liquid, according to that of
the Psalmist: <hi>My hart is become as dissolued or liquifyed wax;</hi>
as wel for the abundance of teares <hi>she</hi> was wont to
shed, as the puritie of <hi>her</hi> mind, which made them so
limpid and cleare.</p>
               <p>She had thirdly the coulour of the Hyacinth; which
<hi>she</hi> tooke, as from the ayre; since al <hi>her</hi> conuersation
was in the ayre, as it were, abstracted from the earth,
or terrene cogitations. <hi>She</hi> was wholy as the <hi>Bird of
Paradise,</hi> which hath no feet to touch the earth with;
&amp; from the time that her Sonne ascended to heauen,
from the mount Oliuet, she could do nothing but cast
vp her eyes thither-wards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so powerfully perhaps
contracted that coulour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through the vehemencie of
her attention, and application to that object, til her
<hi>Assumption</hi> haply, when <hi>she</hi> left it by the way in her
Bow, to remayne for euer, as a signe of her puritie.</p>
               <p>But now to conclude with the green, which <hi>she</hi>
tooke from the earth, what might it be, but a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Spring of al Graces and Vertues, which <hi>she</hi> prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
on earth? Looke into a garden, in that season of
the Spring; and whatsoever your eyes can behold
truly delicious there, in the greennes of the plots and
arbours, both open and close, and in the green-sword
allies and bancks; your vnderstanding shal be able to
paralel and find-out her vertuous conuersation on
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4067:58"/>
earth. For if you consider <hi>her</hi> green walks, they were
al as streight, as garden-walks; for streight were the
paths of <hi>her</hi> whole life. If on the arbours, you shal
find <hi>her</hi> continually in her closet; her plots were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els, but how to become more gratful to her
Sonne, <hi>her</hi> Spouse, <hi>her</hi> Lord; and those alwayes new &amp;
euer green; so as in the garden of <hi>her</hi> mind, was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual

so as among her other works most choice and rare,
the same is accounted as a cheef miracle in Nature,

himself is able to doe in his works of Grace, being

an <hi>Iris</hi> likewise, in this Heauen of Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to astonish

the <hi>Moon</hi> euer was, or euer like to be. For as the <hi>Moon</hi>
indeed hath her light borrowed, very gracious to
behold, but none of her owne, being meerly a light
reuerberated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sun: So the <hi>Virgin</hi> truly, though
her light be borrowed, and none of her owne, as
simply hers, yet hers it is indeed, though borrowed
of her Sonne, the <hi>Sun of Iustice,</hi> as daughter of the King.
For <hi>al the glorie of the King's daughter is within her</hi> &amp;c: not
outwardly only in the voice of people, alwayes
doubtful, euer vncertain, for the most part vndeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and of little subsistence and permanencie, but
intrinsecally in <hi>her</hi> most certain, meritorious, and
for euer. Besides, the <hi>Moon</hi> hath her light often
ecclipsed, and looseth wholy her light for a time;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4067:63"/>
but the blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> though <hi>she</hi> seemed to be ecclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
through the vehemencie of her sorrow, when <hi>she</hi>
saw her Sonne so shadowed by a clowd, in the time
of his Passion, yet for her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stancie of fayth <hi>she</hi> could
not be ecclipsed so, as to despaire of his Resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

mutabilities they are. One is of the mind, which is
often moued through diuers affecti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ons; another in the
bodie, which is subiect to manifold alteration and
corruption; an other of fortune, because temporal
things are alwayes a flowing or ebbing, a flux or
reflux, the losse of guilt and offence which is in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
who alwayes are sliding from vice to vice. But
our <hi>Ladie</hi> hath al these changes and mutabilities vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her feet, since the <hi>Moon</hi> indeed is placed <hi>vnder her
feet;</hi> while <hi>she</hi> alwayes retained the constancie of her
mind, and Vow of Virginitie; <hi>she</hi> put on the glorie
of Immortalitie on her bodie; <hi>she</hi> trampled al terrene
and temporal things vnder foot; and lastly through
a singular prerogatiue was euer priuiledged from
sinne. Furthermore, the <hi>Moon</hi> hath her light al speck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ouer with little spots: but our blessed <hi>Ladie</hi> had
no blemish or spot at al, either in her thoughts,
because alwayes pure and immaculate; or in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
because Angelical. <hi>Thou art wholy fayre, my friend,
And there is no spot in thee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 4.</note> I say, most fayre in cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

can surpasse her Rational, Sensible, or Insensible

               <p>The <hi>Moon</hi> is sometimes wholy obscure, sometimes
wholy lucid and bright, and sometimes partly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
and partly resplendent; wherin it resembles the
<hi>Virgin</hi> right. For the <hi>Moon,</hi> as <hi>S. Augustin</hi> sayth, is obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
either when it is vnder a clowd, or when ecclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
or when renewed, as in the new <hi>Moon:</hi> So the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Virgin</hi> in this world, was thrice or three manner
of wayes obscured. First, through her excessiue humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
which was a kind of obscure clowd, that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shadowed
her brightnes or splendour in the eyes of
the world. <hi>Black I am but beautiful;</hi> as if she had sayd:<note place="margin">Cant. 1.</note>
I am outwardly black through humilitie, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
beautiful in grace and maiestie. Secondly,
through acerbitie and bitternes of sorrow; and this
in the Passion of her Sonne, as I sayd aboue, where
she suffered an ecclips in the veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of her greef.
<hi>The Sun,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Christ, shal be turned into darknes</hi>
through death; and the <hi>Moon,</hi> to wit, <hi>the blessed Virgin,
into bloud,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>el 2.</note> that is, into dolour. And thirdly, through
corporal death; for then became she obscure in a
sort, when her soule departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her precious bodie
so obscured, as it were to become a new <hi>Moone</hi> againe
in her <hi>Assumption;</hi> and then indeed <hi>was she a moone most
perfect for euer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly this <hi>Moon</hi> of ours, was wholy lucid, in
her <hi>Assumption,</hi> because she was glorified in soule and
bodie, and receaued there her double Stole; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
shines vpon vs, with her infinit fauours and
graces, which <hi>she</hi> dayly sends vs. For then indeed as
the <hi>Moon</hi> is wholy bright and lucid, when <hi>she</hi> shines in
the beginning, midst, and to the end of the night: by
which night is tribulation both signified and vsually
vnderstood: And as some <hi>Saints</hi> there are, who help
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4067:64"/>
the afflicted, in the beginning of the night as it were;
others, who suffer men to fal into tribulation, and to
be tempted, in the beginning and middle, but help
and succour them at the end: the blessed <hi>Virgin</hi> shines
with her fauours vpon the distressed, as wel in the
beginning, in affording courage; and in the midle, in
giuing perseuerance; as in the end, in placing the
crowne on their heads. This is she, when others fayle,
who neuer fayles; whom other <hi>Saints</hi> for sinnes iustly
forsake, she neuer leaues; and while others seeme to
subtract their suffrages, she alwayes helps.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this <hi>Moon</hi> was partly lucid and partly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure;
and this truly in the Passion of her Sonne, where
both she was obscured, and yet gaue light; obscure,
through inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se sorrow, yet lucid by most firme Fayth.
For as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sun is ecclipsed, the <hi>Moon</hi> being oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
between vs &amp; the Sun, appeares wholy obscure:
so when the <hi>Sun of Iustice</hi> suffered ecclips at his death,
the blessed <hi>Virgin</hi> became wholy dark, that is, quite
ouercast and ful of sorrow; And yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>she</hi> shined euen then likewise, because <hi>she</hi> kept
the light of Fayth vnextinguished in her.<note place="margin">Prou. vlt.</note> 
                  <hi>Her light shal
not be extinguished in the night.</hi> Surely two Heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s there
are, which yet neuer lost their light, nor euer are
like to doe: to wit, <hi>Christ</hi> for one, who neither with
death did forgoe the light of his Diuinitie, but his
Deitie was both with his bodie in the Sepulcher, and
with his soule in <hi>Limbus:</hi> and his Mother the other,
who neuer lost the light of grace and fayth within
her.</p>

               <p>Consider then, that as in the opinion of such as
hold the <hi>Moon</hi> encreasing to haue her horns directed
towards the rising of the Sun; but decreasing, or
being in the wayne, to haue the horns pointing to
the setting of the Sun: So our heauenlie, Angelical,
and spiritual <hi>Moon,</hi> the Incomparable <hi>Virgin-Mother,</hi>
had certain addresses and preparations, of humilitie
and Virginitie, wherewith she disposed herself, to
embrace her Sun in her armes, in the morning of his

that is, at his Passion, regarded him with two other

especially selected by that great <hi>Assuerus</hi> of <hi>Starres,</hi> to
cast his most amorous glances and fayrest influence
vpon. This happie and auspicious <hi>Starre</hi> is knowne
and called by diuers names, according to the offices
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4067:68"/>
she discharges in the great <hi>Assuerus</hi> his house. For first
is she stiled by the name of <hi>Venus,</hi> not as the Goddesse
of Loue, which the <hi>Poets</hi> feigne, but for that she dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
them to loue, whom she lwayes, and exercises her
vertues on. Secondly, she is called the <hi>Morning-Starre,</hi>
because she shewes and declares the <hi>Morning</hi> now at
hand, and euen begins the same herself with her bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
torch, to glad the world withal, who then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to shake off sleepe, and disperse the mistie va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,
which so long had shadowed &amp; clowded ouer
the Gemell <hi>Starres</hi> or Eyes of the Microcosmes of
men. Thirdly, they cal her <hi>Lucifer,</hi> in that her light ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
so much the other <hi>Starres;</hi> so as wel she may be
sayd, the <hi>Hester</hi> of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al. And fourthly, she is tearmed
the <hi>Hesperus,</hi> for as much as she respects the ensuing

or as much as this same Firmament itself,
where GOD eternally raignes in his Empyreal and

may aptly agree, according to these other things,
which are sayd of her: <hi>I am the Mother of faire dilection,

<hi>she</hi> giues the beginning of <hi>Diuine knowledge,</hi> and so is
the <hi>Mother of knowledge;</hi> And lastly <hi>Hesperus,</hi> since <hi>she</hi> so

Marriners is, that when they determine to sayle vnto
some land, to make choice of some one <hi>Starre,</hi> by
whose signe they may be lead without errour into
that part they desire to arriue vnto. And such truly is
the office heer of <hi>Marie</hi> our <hi>Starre,</hi> who directs the
Marriners through the vast sea of the world, in the
Ship of Innocencie or Pennance, to the shore of the
Heauenlie countrey. And not vnlike to this, Pope <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi>
writes, being cited likewise by the sayd <hi>S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
in the same place. By what helps (sayth he) may

               <p>Now therefore as that <hi>Starre</hi> guides and directs the

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ontemplate first,<note place="margin">The Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</note> that howbeit a
<hi>Starre</hi> be sayd, by many degrees to be
greater then the Earth, yet seemes it to
be but a spangle or fierie point only in
that immense and vast vault of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament.
So likewise the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi>
though she be the greatest <hi>Starre</hi> in the Heauenlie
Hierarchie, yet thought she alwayes humbly of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and seemed the least &amp; meanest of al the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> while she liued on earth. For she was
humble in mind, in word, &amp; fact: in mind, because she
euer preferred others before herself; as <hi>Ioseph: Thy
Father and I with heauines haue sought thee;</hi> In word,
because she called not herself the Mother of GOD,
nor Ladie of the world, nor Queene of Heauen, but
the handmayd of CHRIST, when she replyed so:
<hi>Behold the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dmayd of our Lord;</hi> and agayne. <hi>He hath regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the lowlines of his handmayd;</hi> And lastly in fact, because
that after she was now become the <hi>Mother of</hi> GOD; she
made herself the <hi>handmayd of Elizabeth,</hi> when she mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
to her for three months togeather that she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned
with her.</p>
               <p>Consider then, how this <hi>Starre</hi> of ours is as the Pole-<hi>Starre</hi>
or axeltree of the Firmament. For as the whole
circumference of the lesser <hi>Starres</hi> encompasseth the
Pole, and the wheel enuirons the axeltree round: So
is the whole Firmament of Saintlie and Angelical
<hi>Starres,</hi> about this singular &amp; soueraigne <hi>Starre,</hi> that is,
the whole Celestial Court of blessed Spirits, wheele,
as it were; and beset the <hi>Virgin</hi> round, because they
enco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe &amp; enuiron her about as the Queen &amp; Ladie
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al, according to that which the Church sings:
<hi>Like the dayes of the spring-time doe the flowers of roses &amp; lillies
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:4067:71"/>
of the vallies beset her round,</hi> that is, the Orders of Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours
and Virgins; and the <hi>Prophet</hi> sayth: <hi>The Queen stood
at thy right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, in a garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t al of gold with varietie beset round.</hi>
For the Saints are a certain robe or garment of the
blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> adorning her richly indeed like a Ladie
or Queen, where the Apostles afford the embroderie
of gold; Martyrs, the ground of scarlet, Confessours,
Saphyrs and Emeralds; and the Virgins, the Orient
Pearls and Diamonds.</p>
               <p>Po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der lastly, that as this <hi>Starre</hi> is moued most swiftly
by the motion of its Superiour, to wit, of the vpper
firmament or chief Mouer, because it dayly carries it
about the world; but moues most slowly of its owne
motion, for that they say it moues but one degree in
a hundred yeares. So the blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> our delicious
<hi>Starre,</hi> moued neuer of her proper motion, but
through the motion of her Superiour, to wit, the
<hi>Holie-Ghost;</hi> for as much as moued by the <hi>Holie-Ghost</hi>
made she a vow of Chastitie, and kept her virginitie
inuiolable, and that perpetual; moued by the <hi>Holie-Ghost,</hi>
she gaue her assent to the <hi>Conception</hi> of the <hi>Sonne</hi>
of GOD in an instant; being moued to goe to serue her
<hi>Coseu,</hi> presently she climbd the mountains; being
moued (so great with child, and neer her time) to
goe to <hi>Bethlem,</hi> she went her wayes; and lastly moued
to returne againe, immediatly she returned. Behold
how she moued not of herself, but meerly of the
<hi>Holie-Ghost,</hi> which was within her, and guided and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
her in al things: for other motion in moral
actions had she none.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Reuiew:</note> is vnderstood the tree, the
fruit, the oyle. As for the tree, if man be a
tree, turnd vpside downe, as some wil haue
it, whose bodie is the trunck, his legs and
armes the branches, and whose head the
root, where, by the mouth, it takes its nutriment; the
<hi>Oliue</hi> is that tree, since no other tree resembles him so
wel. For no other tree, is so ciuilized as it; no other
tree so vseful and profitable to the neighbour; no
other tree, so medicinal. The first makes him a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,
at least a free Denison amongst men; the second,
a Marchant; and the third, a Physician; and what are
these but trades, faculties, and professions of men?
<hi>Minerua</hi> was the first as the Paynim Antiquitie wil
haue it, who found-out the culture and planting of
the <hi>Oliue,</hi> and expressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the lickour thence, or pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the Oyle; howbeit they grant the Plant had
been euer existing, and had growne before, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather
vnknowne to men, among the other trees.
And for a good while was not the <hi>Oliue</hi> to be found,
but with the <hi>Athenians;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Epidaurians</hi>
contracted with them, to send them yearly <hi>Oliue</hi>
branches for their Sacrifices. And for as much as
the lickour of the <hi>Oliue,</hi> as the Oyle expressed, is apt
for al arts, they held <hi>Minerua</hi> was the Inuentresse of al
arts. For surely, there is hardly anie Art, that makes
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:4067:74"/>
not vse of this vnctuous lickour, we cal <hi>Oyle of Oliues.</hi>
There are two sorts of these Oliue-trees; the one Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil,
as I sayd, and fit for Citties, bred and trayned vp
in Gardens, wel cloathed with Oliue-coulour suits
without, and faced or lined with ash-coulour within;
the other Wild, and fitter for the forrests, being
somewhat of a harsher &amp; more churlish disposition;
as being ful of thorns and prickles mingled with the
leaues, and whose fruit seldome or neuer come to
good, as hauing little acquaintance or familiaritie
with the Sun, that perfects al things, by reason of the
thickets of the forrests where they dwel, which
hinder it. But for the nobler &amp; more generous <hi>Oliue,</hi>
they are high and tal of stature, wel branched, and
with as manie armes and hands to feed vs with, as
had <hi>Briarius</hi> to sling and hurt with. Their flowers and
blossomes cluster togeather, like to grapes; the fruit,
made Oual-wise, being long and round, about the
bignes of our damsons; whose bones within, were
they as smal as the flesh is good, the marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts needed
not to venture so far as to the <hi>Indies</hi> for gold or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
while <hi>Spayne</hi> and <hi>Italie</hi> would hold them trade
enough. As for the Oyle, the Poets, who are punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
&amp; Religious in their Epithets, are wont to ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
and mark out al other lickours with their proper
attributs, as to tearme the milk, candid; the honie,
liquid gold; the Rose, crimson; the wine, brisk; but
the Oyle of al others, they cal humid, a qualitie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to al lickours, chiefly, for that it hath no
ariditie of anie mixture with it, as other lickours
haue, euen the water itself, there being nothing more
smooth, slick, and lesse porie, then it. It hath besides
very faire correspondencie with the eyes, and little
lesse then good wil between them; affording itself to
be easily gazed on, as a glasse; and though not so
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:4067:74"/>
transparent as other lickours, yet more reflectiue &amp;
representatiue, then others. It is apt to burne, as
being so liquid, as I sayd; for were it ayrie, it would
vanish into smoke; if earthlie, turne to ashes; but
being humid, it spends itself, and nourishes the fire.
Finally this sweet lickour, as the friend and dear
companion of Nature, restores the fraile forces,
comforts the languishing vigour, repayres and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth
the bodie in decay, clarifyes the voice, dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates,
resolues, and quite consumes the coldnes of
humours, and asswages tumours; and what not?</p>

               <p>Wherefore we aptly marke the <hi>Oliue</hi> in the whole

and Peace. For in the same was made the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of human Redemption, as also of the Diuine
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:4067:75"/>
benignitie and liberalitie; which to the end that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron

done, when <hi>Gabriel</hi> taking the person of an Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
deliuered his Embassage to <hi>Marie,</hi> whom if you
conceaue as the Doue of <hi>Noë,</hi> bringing in his hand a

ensigne of his Legation, you shal not think amisse;
since the <hi>Oliue</hi>-branch is euen with the <hi>Gentils</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
the Symbol of mercie, but in a singular and
peculiar manner denotes to vs the <hi>Virgin</hi> in the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               </p>
               <p>But heer may we demand with <hi>S. Ambrose:</hi> how
came it to passe, the <hi>Oliue</hi> should flourish so suddenly
after the Deluge, and put forth a twig so soone? doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
whether that leaf (for so he calles it) sprung
before the floud, or, during it; concludes it did, and
that the iust <hi>Noë</hi> reioyced, to see some fruit reserued
of the old seed; and gathered thence a notable signe
of the Diuine Mercie, for that as then he had remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the deluge, shewing the fruit which the inundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
could not hurt, as holding the litle branch of green
<hi>Oliue</hi> to be a signe therof, which euen flourished in the
midst of the waters and vniuersal inundation of vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatiue
Iustice, since this <hi>Oliue</hi> of Mercie could not
be drownd, swallowed, or withered wholy. Wherein
truly may we worthily contemplate our blessed <hi>Virgin
Marie</hi> expresly deciphered, as the especially and most
singularly preserued plant of this mysterious <hi>Oliue,</hi>
which euen flourishing before the floud, ceased not
likewise to be green and prosper in the verie floud.
For if the iust man worthily reioyced to behold
yet some fruit to remaine of the old seed; could
he choose but admire this mystical branch of our
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:4067:76"/>
                  <hi>Oliue</hi> heer, which euen so great an vniuersal floud of

               <p>Heer now the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> would haue <hi>Mount-Oliuet</hi>
not to haue been couered wholy with the waters of
the floud, and how that branch of <hi>Oliue</hi> was taken
from that <hi>Mount-Oliuet.</hi> Others report it to haue
been fetcht out of Paradice. Both which I hold ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
if we speake of the Mount or Paradice in a

if we vnderstand it in the mystical. For the

euer green, both in Sommer, Winter,
Spring, and Autumne; and what hew it
receaues in the Spring, it stil retaines
the dead of Winter, when al other
trees besides haue either no leaues, or
els are changed into other coulours, as tasting the
common calamitie of al Plants, some few excepted.
So the incomparable Virgin <hi>Marie</hi> neuer lost the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
greennes of her sanctitie, eyther in the smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Sommer of her abundant consolation in her
ioyful passages with her deer <hi>Sonne;</hi> or in the sad

in the Temple, and when <hi>she</hi> found him afterwards
hanging on a forren tree, so strangely altered, as he

<hi>her</hi> minoritie; nor yet in the Autumne of <hi>her</hi> el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derage,
since look what feruour <hi>she</hi> had in youth, the
same <hi>she</hi> stil retained in her elder yeares.</p>
               <p>Consider then, how the blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> and <hi>her deer
Sonne,</hi> were both <hi>Oliues,</hi> to wit, the fruits of <hi>Oliues.</hi> For
as the <hi>Oliues</hi> are first green,<note place="margin">Isid.</note> then red, then brown or

red, through her burning and enflamed Charitie; and
brown or black,<note place="margin">Cant. 1.</note> through humilitie. <hi>I am black</hi> behold

               </p>
               <p>Ponder lastly, how <hi>Christ</hi> himself was truly the <hi>Oliue;</hi>

And yet the Rauen hath had the
commendation of a good voice, and
been seriously told, she had a good
one; but whosoeuer it was, he did but to flatter her
grosly to herface, &amp; spake not as he thought indeed,
but to bring her into a foole's Paradise, and to sooth
her vp for some politick ends of his owne. But what
haue we heer to doe with such <hi>Saxtons,</hi> as she, that
rings but knells to passengers out of this world? Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
the Swan yet, who though she sings very dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
yet doth it very sweetly; nor should I think the
Swallow had reason of her side, to contend with her
for skil in musick; for if her tune be reasonable good,
she hath no varieties; &amp; though she sing very cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and hath iubiley in the hart, yet hath she no
great melodie in her mouth. The <hi>Philomel</hi> is truly she
of al wind-instruments, that carries the siluer bel
away. For she wil iug-it forth both cheerfully and
sweetly to. She wil sing from the hart, as hauing an
innocent soule of her owne, not an ounce of care
within, nor so much as a Doit of debts to pay. A good
Musicia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> indeed can not choose but be an honest man;
nor doe I see, how an honest man can be ought els,
then a good Musician; since Musick is no more then
a harmonie and sweet accord of diuers tones into
one melodie, without any iarre or discord between
them. And Man is a Harp; the Powers and Faculties of
the Soule, the strings; and Reason, the Harper. If Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:4067:79"/>
then playes wel his part, which makes the honest
man, Oh what a harmonie there is in al, &amp; especially
where the tongue and hart agree togeather? When
<hi>Dauid</hi> playd on the harp, the il Spirit fled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Saul.</hi> And
why? because he hateth vnitie and concord: Whereas
had he iarr'd but neuer so litle, the Spirit had stayd no
doubt. Is it so in the Harp, &amp; not in the Organ of the
voyce? No doubt it is. As the hand striks, what the
hart dictats, so the mouth puts forth, of the abundan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of the hart. The hart then of the Incomparable
<hi>Virgin,</hi> so innocent and free from al engagements, how
cheerful of necessitie must it needs be? and being so
ful of glee and iubiley, how must <hi>she</hi> needs exhale &amp;
vent forth melodie? and consequently, how diuinely
brake <hi>she</hi> forth into that melodious Canticle of her
<hi>Magnificat?</hi> And if euer els where, was that truly veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed

when she is in her deepest silence, to
heare the litle <hi>Nightingal</hi> to warble, in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and recounting her delights &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
to <hi>Zephirus</hi> and the forrests, tuning a
1000. Canzonets, and sweetly cutting the ayre with
repetitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a hundred thousand semi-semi-quauers,
which she lets go without cease. To take her pleasure
and recreation, she wil ballance her self vpon a
branch that shakes, to dance Laualtoes as it were at
the Cade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of her lighter so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs, &amp; to match her voyce
with the siluer streames of a chrystal currant, gliding
there along, which breaking against the litle pibles,
murmures and sweetly purls, while she pearches and
sets herself iust ouer a banck enameled al with
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:4067:80"/>
litle flowers. This litle Musician alone making vp a
song of foure Parts, and a ful Quire of musick, you
would say she held within her throat, a thousand
Quiristers, and as manie Violins, and that the litle
cornet of her beak were in steed of al the wind-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.
It is admirable in so smal a bodie, so cleere,
so sweet, so strong, and pleasant a voice should be
found; that in the Spring, when trees begin to bud
their leaues, whole dayes and nights perpetually she
should sing without intermission at al. For whence
from so litle a bird, so bold and pertinacious a spirit?
Whence that force of containing yet the soule, in
chanting so manie diuersities in the continuation of
one song? and where, I pray, are the liuelie streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
and remissions of the voice co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained? Whence
so artificious and so perfect a knowledge of musick,
so ingenious a modulation, so gratful a tone to the
eares, which now with a continued breath is drawne
out at length, now turns againe with a strange and
admirable varietie, distinguished with a slicing
voice, and then with a wreasted, peeced togeather?
There is truly no Song so hard and abstruse, which
she can not expresse, ful, flat, sharp, quick, long, high,
meane, base, what more? Now in these litle throats,
are al kinds of songs to be found entire and perfect;
which, with so much labour, with so much industrie,
and with so manie instruments inuented, the Art of
man hath deuised. But oh what sport it is, when this
litle feathered voice, this prettie harmonie in the
shape of a bird, this litle end of nothing, as it were,
being viuifyed with musick, is euen readie to kil her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with singing, when she heares the counterfet
<hi>Nightingal</hi> (the Eccho) to mock her, in repeating
and returning her whole melodie againe! For then
she mounts vp, as it were, to the heauens, and then
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:4067:80"/>
stoops againe to the Center of the earth, she flyes,
she followes, she sighs, she sobs, she is angrie, and then
pleas'd againe, she mingles the sharp with the sweet,
the sharp with the B. flat; one while a Chromatick,
then a sweeter stroke, now strikes a Diapente, and
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Diapaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. She counterfets the Hawboy, Cornet,
&amp; Flute; she deuids, she gargles, &amp; hath her Groppo,
the trills, and the like, and al in that her litle throat,
but yet can varie nothing, but the Eccho imitates
and expresses; til at last, as it were, she looseth al pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
falles into a litle chafe with herself, in that
seing nothing, she heares notwithstanding, and so
flyes into some bush to hide her self for shame, til
prickt with a thorn, at last she is pushed to sing
againe; which she doth without measure, where al is
delicious as before.</p>

to be of two sorts: some conuersant in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and some in the marishes; which wil appeare
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:4067:81"/>
by the manner of their singing, there being no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
between them; since the one doth far excel
the other, whether it be the litle pipes of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
be stopt by the vapours of those humid places, I
know not, but am sure of this, that <hi>Iulius Alexandrinus</hi>
vpon the 9. booke of <hi>Galen,</hi> puts a notable difference
between them; for thus he sayes: It is noted, that the
<hi>Nightingals</hi> of the plaine and marish places,<note place="margin">Alex 9 l. Galen.</note> are wont
to giue forth a voice a great deale shirler, then those
of the mountains, the organ of the voice relenting
no doubt through too much moisture, as they cannot
haue so smart, cunning, &amp; tunable a voice with them,
as the others haue.</p>
               <p>Behold then our <hi>Lalie</hi> a <hi>Nightingal</hi> of the mountains:
<hi>For Marie arising went into the mountains,</hi> and so became
the <hi>Nightingal</hi> of the mountains. <hi>She</hi> inhabited not the
fens or marishes of dissolute lubricitie, abode not in
the playnes of an ordinarie vertue, but left the vallies
of baser cogitations, aspired to the tops of Heroical
vertues, placed the nest in the sublimitie of Diuine
contemplations, and dwelt in the top of the mount
of Perfection; whence proceeded that sweet voice,
more sweet then anie mortal harmonie besides: <hi>My
Soule doth magnify our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let others with the tongue, hand, or breath charme
the delicate eares; let them wind the Cornet, with a
thousand diminutions, runne diuisions on the Harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicon
or Virginals: Let them pay the Violin as much
as they wil, spatter the Lute, touch the Orpharion
neuer so sweetly, the Cithern, Pandore, and the Harp
itself: Yet this Canticle of <hi>Magnificat</hi> in my mind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
them al, and wil stand for Organs, Flutes,
Cornets, Harps, Lutes, Citherns, Pandoras, and a
thousand the like. This is the Musick indeed that
pleased GOD, and which I like best, which the syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:4067:81"/>
of the Soule and hart doe make, while the
tongue playes the Harp. GOD magnifyed <hi>Marie</hi>
because he made her great; <hi>Marie</hi> magnified GOD,
because she proclaimed him Great.</p>
               <p>When I think of our <hi>Nightingal,</hi> what hast she made
to goe vnto the mountains, it comes into my mind,
what a certain Authour hath, writing of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of things: That the <hi>Nightingal</hi> is wont to
sing with expedition and celeritie.<note place="margin">Vliss. Aldr. Ornith. l. 28. p. 780.</note> But what are
the causes of her so hastie and precipitous speed?
The <hi>Naturalists</hi> wil tel you: perhaps, because she
feares, least the time of her singing passe away;
perhaps she hastens, least her tunes otherwise
would seeme harsh and vngratful to delicate
eares; perhaps, because she would charme the
eares more powerfully and politely withal. But
why made <hi>Marie</hi> such hast then? Let <hi>Ambrose</hi> tel
vs: The <hi>Virgin</hi> made hast, that she might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
long in publick out of her house. Learne,
you Virgins, sayth he, not to stay in the streets,
nor to hold vnprofitable chats in publick. Againe
let <hi>Ambrose</hi> tel vs: She hastned for ioy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the <hi>Virgins</hi> hart exulted to GOD. Let him
tel vs a third time againe: The <hi>Virgin</hi> being ful of
GOD, whither should she goe but to the higher
places, with ful speed? The grace of the <hi>Holie-Ghost</hi>
knowes no delayes. Let <hi>Origen</hi> yet tel vs: For
that CHRIST, who was in the <hi>Virgins</hi> womb,
made hast to sanctify <hi>Iohn,</hi> and cleanse him from
Original sinne. O let our <hi>Nightingal</hi> therefore sing
apace.</p>
               <p>But hearken awhile, you Musicians, how the
<hi>Nightingal</hi> sings; obserue her wel, and you shal note,
how she pauses not, but equally sings at length with a
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual breath without anie cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, stil holding out
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:4067:82"/>
her wind to the ful: now she sings her diminutions,
and diuides <hi>in infinitum;</hi> now she wrigles and curles
her voice as it were, now she lengthens it againe,
now she drawes it back; one while she chants forth
longer verses, as they were Heroicks; another while,
more short and sudden, much like vnto Saphicks; and
sometimes againe, extreme short as Adonicks. Now
she tunes with a fat and grosser voice, you would ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
say, it were a Sack but at least: anon rings she
forth a most shril treble, as fetched a note aboue <hi>Ela</hi>
at least; cleer; to fil the eares with a siluer sound; sweet,
to charme the hearing with deliciousnes, running
Descant as it were, vpon the ground of her lower
Notes; and now she goes smooth &amp; euen againe, now
seeme you to heare a Tenour voice, then a Counter,
&amp; a Counter-alt following and chasing one another
with certain fugnes. But Oh terrene Philomel, thou
art but a babler heer, with al thy trilloes, if thou
standst in competencie in Musick with this Diuine
<hi>Nightingal.</hi>

to see to, nor expressed with instruments il tuned,
but most diuinely and sweetly done, with a gratful

haue their peculiar Notes, which are as
their proper Dialects, in the region of

are easily distinguished one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, saue only the
<hi>Nightingal,</hi> which hath no proper Note of its owne,
but rather alone is a Quire of al the Musical birds in
the world. So is it right with our heauenlie and diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
<hi>Nightinga;</hi> for as al other creatures chant forth the
prayses of their <hi>Creatour</hi> with Notes each one in their
seueral kinds, our <hi>Nightingal</hi> warbles them, with the
diuersitie of al voices, with the voice of the Angels,
of men, &amp; of things that want both reason and sense.</p>
               <p>Consider then, that, as <hi>Plinie</hi> sayth, the <hi>Nightingal</hi>
sings not so artificiously by nature so much as by art;
while the yong are taught to warble of the elder. The
yonger (sayth he) do meditate and receaue their
verses fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the elder to practise, to imitate: the schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
attentiuely listen, and proue their Notes, and by
turnes hold their peace. You may note a correction
in the learner, and a kind of reprehension in the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher.
Where behold, how <hi>S. Iohn</hi> was a yong <hi>Nightingal;</hi>
and if you doubt it, aske of him, if he be so or no: he
wil tel you: <hi>He is the voice of the desert;</hi> Which is nothing
els but a <hi>Nightingal.</hi> For if you pul but the feathers of
his titles from him, you wil find but a voice, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els; and what is that but a <hi>Nightingal,</hi> that sings
as it is taught by an elder one? whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being in his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

follow and sing likewise, as then could no more, but
skip and dance.</p>
               <p>Ponder lastly, that as the <hi>Nightingal,</hi> though often <hi>she</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:4067:84"/>

of its shoulders; which the more you loade, the

the Phenix wil lightly take vp his Inne no where els.
And verily I think, if the Phenix were to be a tree, it

are so amourous one of an other, as they wil hardly
liue without the societie of each other; and yet so
chast, as they breed and bring forth without contac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
As the Turtle-widowes sit mourning on a
withered branch, or die of greef; so wil the <hi>Palme</hi> in

away. If diuers sexes they haue with them (as some

shew a far off like Tropheys hangd with Fauchions or
Turkie Scimiters; but neerer hand, as loaden and

may seeme as two,<note place="margin">The Motto.</note> but are easily reduced
to one, that is, to a stout Patience, or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Fortitude. If you deuide them, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
attempts without temeritie; and
hauing once begun, without al feare goes through
with it. Patience hath large shoulders, and fit to beare
a burden of iniuries, which it suffers not of pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
or basenes, as not daring to reuenge it self, but
out of a true and Christian magnanimitie, because he
may not. Fortitude seekes not dangers, but meeting
with them, beares them brauely indeed with courage
and good successe. Patience is so subiect to it self, as
iniuries can not subdue it, as holding this Maxim,
that the whole victorie consists in yealding. Fortitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
is sole Mistris of it self, submitting passions to
Reason's lore, through which interiour victorie it
works its owne peace. Patience walkes aboue Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
so long as it is beneath itself. Fortitude is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at nothing, but for displeasing the Soueraigne
Good, and feares nothing but Sinne. Patience makes
vse of Lawes for its onlie protection, not for reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
and its owne forces, to eschew indignities and
not to offer them. If Fortitude haue a quarel in hand,
it regards not the arme, but the cause, not how stout
it is, but how innocent; and where it hath equitie
for warrant, wel may it be maistered, but not
vanquished. The contrarie euents, do only exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,

so equal, and perseuering so long at the foot of the

the palme. It is euen the Tower of Plants,
both for height and strength at once; for if
the Pine be higher, it is the weaker; if the
Oak be stronger, it is nothing neer so high; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with Antiquitie it was the Symbol of constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and victorie. It is (as I may say) the Phenix of
trees, with which it hath such simpathies, as what
with the Etimologie of the name, being the same in
Greek, and the faire correspondencies they haue
with each other, in Authours they are much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.
And for the Phenix, she wil neast herself in
none other. The <hi>Palmes</hi> are likewise the Turtles amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
trees; for they are Male and Female, as they; they
match and payre togeather as they, and are as loyal
as they, and ful as chast as they. For in the absence of
each other, they produce no fruit, and yet (wherin
they much exceed the Turtles) they bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forth
without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taction of branch or root, but it is enough
that they enioy each others companie; and so great
a sympathie they haue withal, that if they be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted

from each other, they mourne and languish
likewise, if not dye. The <hi>Palme</hi> is euen the Magazin of
al prouisions, for the vse and sustentation of man.
The <hi>Indians</hi> haue need of manie things, and lo the
<hi>Palme</hi> supplyes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al; so as if anie one be industrious
among them, or anie thing be very profitable, they
wil say immediately: <hi>Behold the Palme.</hi> It affords them

they couer their houses, as we with tiles; they write

for who sees not the <hi>Assumption</hi> of the <hi>Mother of</hi> GOD,
to be nothing els, but a certain translation of her fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
this Militant to the Triumphant Church? A <hi>Palme</hi>
being oppressed with a heauie weight, was put vp in
the Obsequies of <hi>Marguerit</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> with this Deuise:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:4067:87"/>
                  <hi>Subacta mole resurgo;</hi> representing therin, how the Iust

faire and beautiful then before; though formerly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
by the burden of death and of human ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie.
And so was it with our incomparable <hi>Ladie</hi>
in an eminent degree, especially (I say) at her glorious
<hi>Assumption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Palmes,</hi> there are Male and Female; and
the Female neuer brings forth fruits, but standing
opposit by her Male; and hence it is, that two <hi>Palmes,</hi>
being planted by two banck-sides of a riuer, are the
Hieroglifick of Nuptials, with <hi>Valerius:</hi> &amp; especially,
say I, of the Spiritual Nuptials between the <hi>Spouse,</hi> &amp;
his <hi>Spouse,</hi> between <hi>Christ</hi> and his blessed <hi>Mother.</hi> Amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
these <hi>Palmes</hi> likewise, is noted this difference; that the
Male growes and flourishes sooner then the Femal;
and so fares it heer with our two <hi>Palmes,</hi> our <hi>Sauiour
Christ,</hi> and his deare <hi>Mother.</hi> Where, of the first sayth
the Prophet: <hi>The iust shal flourish like the Palme;</hi> And the
latter sayth of herself:<note place="margin">Psal. 31</note> I <hi>am exalted like a Palme in Cades;</hi>
with this difference,<note place="margin">Eccl. 24.</note> that <hi>Christ</hi> much sooner then
his <hi>Mother</hi> arising to immortal life, seemed to flourish
sooner:<note place="margin">Psal. 27.</note> as he testifyes of himself: <hi>And my flesh hath
flourished.</hi> But the blessed <hi>Virgin</hi> dying some yeares
afterwards, and gloriously resuscitated, did flourish
indeed, but so as after him.</p>
               <p>It is sayd moreouer, that though the <hi>Palme</hi> grow
higher then manie trees, yet neuer arriues it to the
height of the Cedar. So likewise, though our mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<hi>Palme,</hi> our admirable <hi>Ladie,</hi> were raysed and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
so high, as she far transcended the glorie of al men
and Angels, yet to the height of the glorie of <hi>Christ,</hi>
very aptly signified by the Cedar, was she neuer
assumpted, as wel for sublimitie as innated incorru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptibilitie;
because our <hi>Lord Christ</hi> as wel in the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:4067:87"/>
Triumphant as Militant Church is the Head of the
mystical Bodie, whereof his <hi>Mother</hi> was a member
only, though the noblest part of al, as being <hi>the
neck.</hi> Heerto may be added that prettie Deuise of
<hi>Mark Anthonie,</hi> being this: a Pillar wreathed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
about with two branches, the one of <hi>Palme,</hi> the
other of <hi>Cypresse,</hi> with this Motto: <hi>Erit altera merces;</hi>
signifying thereby, the recompence of a generous
man, was either a noble Victorie, or an honourable
Death; for that the <hi>Palme</hi> representing victorie, the
Cypresse of the other side is a Symbol of death, being
ordinarily vsed in the Funerals and Sepulchers of
the dead. So was al the life of the blessed Virgin a
perpetual standing pillar or Trophey, as is were, of
incredible Mysteries, especially in the <hi>palme</hi> of her
glorious <hi>Assumption,</hi> yet by the meanes of the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
of her death, since that was to be the way and
the next step to her highest aduancement, and the
greatest victorie of al.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Palme,</hi> is sharp and rough beneath, but smooth
and handsome aboue; wherein <hi>S. Gregorie</hi> sayth in his
Morals, the life of the iust man is aptly represented,
being bitter and rough in the exteriour shew and in
the sensitiue part, but yet sweet and delightful
through contentments which the soule receaues the
while: So was the whole life of the Mother of GOD
nothing els but a life of paynes and doulours, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
at the passion of her deerest <hi>Sonne,</hi> which
through compassion she made her owne, but yet
sweet for the end, to wit, of a life of rest and repose
afterwards in the kingdome of Heauen, and of the
ineffable ioyes of her glorious <hi>Assumption</hi> by
the way, as riding in Triumph. Which <hi>Saint</hi>
besides, makes yet another note, which is
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:4067:88"/>
this; that the <hi>Palme</hi> heerin is differing from other
trees, in that the other are grosse beneath, and grow
slenderer vpwards; while the <hi>Palme</hi> of the contrarie,
is slender beneath, and bigger and grosser, the higher
it goes: So were the thoughts of the blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> the
true <hi>Palme</hi> indeed, as poore and slender downe to the
earth-wards, but substantial and solid vp to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
<hi>whose conuersation</hi> doubtles, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> sayth, <hi>was
wholy in Heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Strange things are reported of the <hi>Palmes,</hi> to liue
mutually, and dye togeather. A singular type surely
of the Sympathie between our two <hi>Palmes,</hi> our <hi>Christ</hi>
and his blessed <hi>Mother,</hi> affording one life, and as it
were one self-same death between them both. For
<hi>Christ</hi> dying, she languished as dead; and he arising
from his Sepulcher after his death, she reuiued
againe as it were from death. And so that same Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph
more fitly might be applyed to these Diuine
<hi>Louers,</hi> our amourous <hi>Palmes,</hi> which a certain Poet
of ours had framed for a payre of profane Louers,
dying both with one and the self-same sword:

trauellers on the way, preseruing them
from the scorching rayes of the Sun,
and yealding them Dates to expel

and protection, we are saued from the outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
heats of concupiscence, fed with the delicious
examples of her life, and cloathed with the habits of
her vertues, and especially refreshed with the sweet
consideration of the limpid streames of her purest
chastitie, no lesse then Nectar in the tast.</p>
               <p>Consider then, how as the <hi>Palme</hi> is rough without,
narrow beneath, and broad on the top, wheron the
Phenix takes delight to build his neast: So was our

of her Nazarean neighbours, being held for no
more, then a Carpenter's wife; while she was truly
indeed the <hi>Palme</hi> of <hi>Cades.</hi> Beneath she was narrow,
that is, in the loue of terrene things, wheron she
touched as it were, but in a point only of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
nature, not acquainted with the impurities
and miseries therof: but broad on the top, that is,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:4067:89"/>
in Diuine contemplation, and loue of celestial
things, <hi>where she alwayes dwelt in the highest;</hi> and where

               <p>Ponder lastly, that as the <hi>Palme</hi> euer flourisheth
and neuer withers, so our Incomparable <hi>Mother</hi> of

because most pure and neat; and green and

GOD himself, the Monarck of the whole Vniuers, is
seen to be euerie where within his Dominions,
through his essence, power, and presence, but not in

of al which yealds it a pertinent and satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
reason to the curious examiners, why euerie
thing is so done, this and not that. Some are Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitects
by hand only, and no more, who frame
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:4067:92"/>
their buildings by roat, taking forth copyes heer
and there, but can afford no reason at al for what
they do, nor inuent ought that is worth a rush; and
for a final reason say nothing but, such is the custome
so to do. Others are Architects by booke only, and
by discourses which they haue read; but they haue
no hands to put in practise, and know but the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
only; such as they, are good for nothing, but
to build a <hi>house</hi> for <hi>Plato,</hi> of Ideas, al suspending in
the ayre. The good Architect should linck his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
with his hand, and the compas with his reason,
setting his hand to work, as wel as the brayne. The
first do frame but bodies without a soule; the second,
soules without a bodie; the third do build the whole,
and are men of note and reputation indeed. The
perfect Architect indeed should be ignorant in no
Science; otherwise, if he do wel, it is by chance, or
els by nature, as beasts do, which do manie goodlie
things, and know not why, nor wherefore. He had
need be a Painter, to make his plaines, eleuations,
designes, &amp; to copie-out a thousand rarities to please
the phantasie withal; a Geometrian, to handle the
compas, for the vse of Circles, rulers, squares, plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets,
and the like; To haue the Perspectiue, to let-in
lights into his <hi>house,</hi> to steale-in the day in certain
corners, to content the eye with diuers aspects; and
if not directly to introduce the Sunnie rayes, at least
obliquikly through reflexions; The Arithmetick, to
cast vp and calculate the charges he is at, to number
the materials and degrees that belong thereto; The
Historie: for al the enrichments of buildings, Armes,
statues, and other ornaments, are nothing els but
Historie, true and fayned, which if he knowes not,
he shal commit a thousand errours; To haue Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie,
to know the nature of beasts, the seas,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:4067:93"/>
the elements, flowers, fruits, and al whatsoeuer in
nature; Astrologie and Phisick, in planting his <hi>house</hi>
in a holsome and sound climat, in choosing the best
Sun, a good wind, the purest ayre, holesome waters,
a faire and free prospect, a good situation for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and profit. This is certain, that al art is then in
truest perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when it may be reduced to some na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Principle or other. For what are the most iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

in our <hi>House</hi> is seen, comparing it with the fabrick of
our natural bodies, wherin the high <hi>Architect</hi> of the

human reason to enter into it: Where the Hart, as the
Fountain of life, is placed in the midle, for the more
equal communication of the vital spirits; the Eyes
seated aloft, to comprehend the greater circuit in
their view; the armes, proiected on each side for the
vse and commoditie of reaching; Briefly, the place
of euerie part, is determined by the vse. Wherefore,
the principal chambers of delight (as Studies and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries)
should be towards the East: for the Morning
is a friend to the Muses; Al offices requiring heat, as

                  </q>
But who sees not, how this <hi>House</hi> heer, wherin the <hi>Sun</hi>
of <hi>Iustice</hi> dwelt, did farre exceed the same, whose

for whose golden pillars, were the Guifts of the

her most ardent Charitie abundantly supplyed; &amp; for

then those others did the <hi>Ouidian</hi> Pallace of the Sun.</p>
               <p>

<hi>With clarity:</hi> note the luster of Vertues.</p>
               <p>Consider then, that as a <hi>House</hi> hath also Galleries
for recreation and delight, so had our Mystical <hi>House</hi>
heer, delicious galleries to walke in, and, for varietie,
three: to wit, the lower, the middle, and the vpper
gallerie. The lower was sustained with siluer pillars;
and therefore is it sayd, that <hi>wisedome erected siluer pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</hi>
The middle was paued with precious stones, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that: <hi>The middle was strewed with charitie.</hi> The
highest was hangd with silks and purples; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is added <hi>a purple ascent.</hi> The lower gallerie of
this virginal <hi>house,</hi> was the precious bodie of the
<hi>Virgin;</hi> the middle, her purest soule; and the highest,
her sublime and Angelical spirit. Her bodie was the
lower gallerie, because her sensualitie was neuer
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:4067:96"/>
prone to euil, but alwayes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to reason. Her
soule, the second; because strewed with precious sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that is, Diuine vertues. Her Spirit was the vpper
gallerie, &amp; adorned with purple ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gings, for being so
enflamed with charitie, or wounded with the sorrow
of her <hi>Sonne's</hi> passion, or sprinckled with his bloud.</p>
               <p>Ponder lastly, as a <hi>house,</hi> especially the Pallace of
Kings, requires to be spacious and ample; so was this
<hi>House,</hi> our <hi>Ladie,</hi> being the <hi>House</hi> of GOD, most spacious
&amp; wide; according to that which the <hi>Church</hi> sings of
her: <hi>Whom the heauens can not containe, hast thou held in thy
lap.</hi> Secondly, wide and ample in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passion, while she
receaues al, and refuseth none, into the bowels of her
mercie; receauing the tempted, in prtoecting them
from the snares of the Diuel; Sinners, in obtaining
mercie and grace for them; the Iust, in conseruing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in grace obtained; and lastly the Dying, in receauing
their soules into her protection: and therefore sayd
to be <hi>Mother of grace, and mother of mercie.</hi>

the latter more happie and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.
It is sayd indeed: <hi>Beatius est dare

giue protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, inuolues a power to be able to afford
it; to take the same, implyes a necessite to recurre

Whence that: <hi>Behold the handmayd of our Lord. God hath

               </p>
               <p>But how then, O mysterious <hi>Hen,</hi> louest thou dust
so wel, hating al fowlnes and sordities so much?
Feltst thou the itching of Vanitie a whit, that thou
shouldst scrape in that sort? No, not the least itching
of vaine ostentation infested <hi>thee,</hi> the immaculate
<hi>Virgin.</hi> Or wouldst thou haue pranckt thy quils &amp; plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of supernal affects? It was not needful, since
they were without anie lets to hinder them at al. Or
was thy intention, to shake off at least any euil cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations?
Not so likewise; no such thing had euer
accesse or ingresse into that purest mind. No
temptation of arrogancie, ostentation, or pride
could euer find admittance there. But truly, this it
was; thou louedst Humilitie, which thou knewest to
be gratful and acceptable to thy <hi>Sonne,</hi> which could
no where more appeare, then in the dust of human

<hi>thou</hi> diggest so in the dust of thy Nothing: to find, as
<hi>Hens</hi> are wont in the dust, some food more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to them; for this is a maine cause likewise of
their so frequent scraping in the dust; &amp; who knowes
perhaps, whether they may not light on a gemme

<hi>Virgin Marie</hi> indeed euen nourished herself with
humilitie, as a most sauourie food vnto her; this she
supposed to lye in the dust of her proper abiection;
and therefore with clawes of consideration, neuer
left she digging and scraping it forth; nor was she
anie whit deceaued; the earth of her abstraction,
gaue her abundantly to feed most deliciously. And
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:4067:100"/>
which is more, she found, in so doing, the precious

As an armie wel marshalled, is a terrour to the

               <p>Consider then, the great compassion of the <hi>Hen</hi>
towards her yong; which appeares in this, that with
the sick and infirme, she wil be infirme; she is so sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
in feeding them, as she finds not a graine, but
she calles them to her, to participate therof: And
for her care of preseruing them from danger, she
clucks them vnder her wings, from the rapin of the
kites, and the like rauenous fowle. And then weigh
withal the tender compassion the <hi>Virgin-Mother</hi> hath
euer shewen towards vs her Children and Seruants,
in being so sollicitous to feed vs, while she was on
earth, with the food of her doctrine: <hi>She hath opened
her mouth in wisedome, and the law of clemencie in her toung;</hi>

to be conserued in grace, and may say with him li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewise:
<hi>She hath shadowed vs with her shoulders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ponder lastly, how the <hi>Hen</hi> not only sits vpon her

should set the price, or price and valew

of GOD is such, to haue them so, that
things which are excellent in themselues, should be
rare and scarce to be found, that <hi>pearls</hi> (for worth)
might not be cast to swine, or trampled vnder foot.
Monsters are rare indeed, and yet most hateful, and
prodigious. It is the worth then that giues the price
to things. The Sybils Books were valued lesse being
nine, then when they were but three; not for the
plentie of the nine, or scarcitie of the three; but to
let <hi>Tarquinius</hi> see, the true estimate and value of each
one; and had he not perhaps taken her at last at her
word, as he did, he had payd as much for one alone,
as for the nine, or gone without it. Yea gold itself,
were it as common happely as manie other things
are of litle worth, would yet be in as great esteeme
as now it is, through a certain excellence it hath in
itself aboue others. And therefore S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did very
wel, to dresse vp GOD al in gold, and paue the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of ioyes with the same: for otherwise, do I
feare, that manie an one, would neuer haue had

then a yelow earth, a glittering Stone, a kind of froth
boyling from Hel, should haue such a power vpon
reasonable men? So as wel it may seeme, to be the
Golden Age, since al is set vpon gold; they wish but
gold, they speake or thinke of nothing els but gold,
when lo, the Gold of gold, the precious Margarit of
<hi>Pearls,</hi> is truly valuable indeed, the Incomparable

the Scallop, wherin it is a prisoner, while it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
its food from the heauens, and hath its whole
alliance with them. They vse to counterfeit the same
in a thousand manners with glasse, and aboue al, with
the <hi>Mother-Pearl,</hi> in beating it to powder, and making
a past therof, and then causing pigeons to let it
downe, which with their natural heat do boile
and polish it in the manner it is, and then put it
forth againe. The <hi>Mother-pearl</hi> engenders from the

forth her <hi>Pearl</hi> withal, either siluer, pale, or yelowish,
according as the Sun makes it, or the ayre, whence it
feeds, be more or lesse pure. Receauing then the deaw
of Heauen into the gaping shel, it formes litle
graines or seeds within it, which cleaue to its sides,
then grow hard, and geale, as it were: and so Nature

we al know, what <hi>Pearls</hi> of sanctitie are lightly

But if we looke into the other congruities
between them, we shal find them to sympathize so,
as we may wel tearme our <hi>Virgin-Mother,</hi> a <hi>Pearl</hi> or
<hi>Margarit</hi> of the Heauens, as the other of the
Seas.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Margarit,</hi> as I sayd, is bred in the Sea; which
<hi>Isidor</hi> affirmes, and that in this manner. At certain
times of the yeare, to wit, in the Spring and Autum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
the cockles, oysters, or scollops, or cal them what
you wil, approach to the Sea-shore, and lye there ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and opening themselues, and receaue the
celestial deaw into their bowels; from the coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
wherof, as abouesayd, are the <hi>Margarits</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred.
Now this Shelfish, oyster, or <hi>Mother-Pearl</hi>
(for the Mother, or issue <hi>Pearl,</hi> are al of a substance,
as mothers and embrions vse to be) is the <hi>Virgin-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Pearl</hi>
it self, which opened her Virginal soule,
at her mysterious <hi>Annunciation,</hi> in the Spring of the
yeare, by the quiet shore of her tacit and silent
contemplation, to receiue the heauenlie Deaw, the
new <hi>Margarit:</hi> that is, to conceaue that precious
<hi>Pearl, Christ Iesus,</hi> in her womb. For she opened her
consent, to the great Angel, her singular Paranimph,
to obey GOD in al things, saying: <hi>Behold the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayd
of our Lord, &amp;c.</hi> and her soule likewise to the
<hi>Holie-Ghost,</hi> to ouershadow her: and after the opening
thus of her free consent, and her Angelical soule, the
Celestial deaw of the <hi>Holie-Ghost</hi> descended into her,
and so this infant-<hi>Pearl</hi> was diuinely begot in the
virginal womb of the Virgin-mother - <hi>Pearl.</hi> Of
which deawing of the <hi>Holie-Ghost,</hi> and opening of
the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> therevnto, it is prophetically sayd:
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:4067:105"/>
                  <hi>Deaw you heauens thervpon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isay. 45</note> 
                  <hi>and let the clouds rayne
downe the Iust; let the earth open and bring forth the
Sauiour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These <hi>Pearls</hi> besides, if they be right <hi>Margarits</hi>
indeed, are faire, white, and cleer; for such as are so,
are truly of the best, and a great deale better then
those which are dimmer, and of a yellow and duskish
coulour. For those which are faire, white, and cleer,
are bred of the morning-deaw; and the others, of thar
which falles in the euenings. And our Incomparable
<hi>Margarit,</hi> was predestinate so from the morning of
the eternal Decree in Heauen, so created, as it were,
<hi>ab initio &amp; ante secula,</hi> while the other <hi>pearls</hi> of lesse
regard were only produced in the euening, after
that sinne was brought into the world.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Margarit</hi> therefore so faire, so white, and cleer,
signifyes our heauenlie <hi>Margarit</hi> and glorious <hi>Virgin,</hi>
who was beautiful and faire in mind through a
more then Angelical puritie of hers consisting in the
mind; most snowie and white in bodie, through an
immaculate chastitie and virginitie; and cleer and
sincere in works, through a simple sanctitie, and
Saintlie simplicitie in al her actions, in the whole
course of her blessed and incomparable life, which
she led on earth.</p>
               <p>I sayd aboue, that <hi>Pearls</hi> being stampt and beat to
powder are holesom, soueraigne, and medicinal
for manie maladies; wherof I find the <hi>Naturalists</hi>
chiefly to reckon three: <hi>First,</hi> they are purgatiue,
because they purge and euacuate the bodie of al
noxious and superfluuous humours; secondly, restric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
staying the flux of bloud or venter; and thirdly,
they comfort and corroborate the hart, being readie
to faynt or swoune through debilitie of the spirits,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:4067:106"/>
or the vital parts. To these infirmities, the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of these pownded <hi>Pearls</hi> so beat to powder, are
of singular auayle. In this manner the Blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi>
being seriously pressed with importunitie of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and often vrged and called vpon with incessant
vowes, relenting and mollifyed at last, as fallen
into powder, applyes herself, first through a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue
power to purge vs of our sinnes, by procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
vs the grace of Contrition, and the holesome
Sacrament of Pennance, to bewayle and purge our
sinnes past; secondly, with her restrictiue vertue,
to restraine the soule from flowing and falling agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
into future sinnes; and thirdly, with her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storatiue,
comfortatiue, and corroboratiue power,

bring-in the <hi>Pearl</hi> withal: or for the vnion of the
Celestial deaw, with the Conchal nature, to make
vp a <hi>Pearl,</hi> in the lap of the fish, I wil not say: this I am
sure of, that our blessed <hi>Pearl</hi> heer is called <hi>Deipara,</hi>
as much to say, as the <hi>Mother</hi> of GOD; nor can she be so
called a <hi>Mother,</hi> as she is, but GOD must needs be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to her, to make vp her name.</p>
               <p>Consider then, that as the <hi>Mother-pearl,</hi> being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:4067:107"/>
only a meer shel-fish of its owne nature, and of
no greater a ranck then a playne oyster of the Sea:
yet through the appetite she had to suck, and draw
in the heauenlie deaw into her bowels, obtained the
especial priuiledge and prerogatiue, to become indeed
the <hi>Mother</hi> of the true oriental <hi>Pearl.</hi> So the <hi>virgin-mother,</hi>
though she were, as she sayd herself, the sillie
handmayd of our Lord, and of our human nature,
subiect to the natural fray leties therof; yet through
a singular immunitie with the puritie of her
intention, integritie of bodie, and Angelical can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
of mind, disposing herself most affectuously and
ardently indeed, to receaue the Celestial deawes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
heauen, that is, the grace of perfect Vnion with GOD,
in her pure soule, she deserued to become the <hi>Mother</hi>
of the <hi>Pearl</hi> of <hi>Pearles,</hi> sweet IESVS.</p>
               <p>Ponder lastly, that if a meer <hi>Pearl,</hi> being so basely
bred in an oyster-shel, whose extract at the best is
but meer Deawes let fal from the nether Region of
the Ayre, and those but drops of fresh water, as it
were impearled in the fish, through benefit of the
Sun should come to be so highly prized as we haue
sayd, being no more then a meer seed of <hi>Pearl</hi> somwhat
fairer then the rest of that kind; how are we to prize
and magnify, trow you, our heauenlie <hi>Pearl</hi> heer,
whether you meane the <hi>Pearl,</hi> or <hi>Mother</hi> herself? the

Reading indeed, though it much auayle to lead vs

serious Meditation doth; &amp; Meditation though it
dig into the Rock, yet dwels not so quietly there,
nor rests so sweetly in the Rock, as a deep Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation

into a thousand coulours, more various then

as scarlet, cerulean, flame-coulour, and yealding a

And though she be neuer so chast, innocent, and
loyal to her mate, yet can she not auoyd his iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.
Which you may see, and it is a pleasant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
to note the while, when the Cock
returns to his Douecot, how, discouering his iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies,
his litle breast wil swel vp to the bignes of
his bodie; then with the voice to break forth into
a hoarse and angrie note; by and by to walke in state,

with the shew of a wrothful <hi>Nemesis,</hi> rake the ground,

he persecutes the poore wretch, deseruing it not. Yet
she abides very patient to al, nor is troubled a whit

with more ardent affection, renewes the

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:4067:111"/>
and worldlie things, but to Celestial and eternal;

fed of the Bread of life, the thing represented by

<hi>He satiats thee with the fat of corne;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isay. 63.</note> and hath rednes

and besides is white within, and expresseth the

This <hi>Doue</hi> then fed of such a grayne, because

               </p>
               <p>And for her groanes, the ordinarie musick
of the Lyre of her hart, they were the lamentable
and sad accents, which the Passion of her deer <hi>Sonne</hi>
had caused in her. For lo, this <hi>Doue</hi> with the rest
of that desolate and mourning flight of <hi>Maries,</hi> her
fellow-doues, did nothing els, but sigh and
groane, in beholding the onlie Pearl of doues, her
deerest Sonne, in so piteous a plight, so hampered
and entangled in the fowler's nets. <hi>Like Doues
that meditate, they groned sore,</hi> as the Prophet sayth,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:4067:111"/>
especially this <hi>Doue</hi> aboue the rest, the incomparable
<hi>Virgin-Doue,</hi> being the natural Dam and parent of the
poore distressed one, most sadly powring forth a
floud of teares without measure. Whence <hi>S. Anselm</hi>
sayth in a certain place:<note place="margin">S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selm.</note> My most merciful <hi>Ladie,</hi> what
fountains may I say brake forth of thy purest eyes,
when thou sawest thy onlie innocent Sonne to be
scourged, bound, &amp; so cruelly entreated before thee,
and the flesh of thy flesh so mangled in thy sight?
what groanes shal I imagin thy breast sent forth the
while, when thou heardst him say: <hi>Woman, behold thy
Sonne;</hi> and agayne: <hi>Behold thy mother?</hi> For she could not
see her Sonne to be so crucifyed, without groanes,
and motherlie laments for her dying Sonne, the ioy
of her hart, and hart of al her ioyes, so pierced with a
souldiers speare, that euen transfixed withal the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
breast, a verie <hi>Niobe</hi> of teares, or rather <hi>Noome</hi> of bitter groanes.</p>
               <p>Now for the wing, which so eternizeth the <hi>Doues,</hi>
and makes them most illustrious among fowles of
the highest pitch, this I note, they loue not much
to fly alone, bur to assemble themselues in flights.
The blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> is that Woman cloathed with
the sunne, of whome it is sayd in the <hi>Apocalyps,
that two wings were giuen her to fly with, in the
desert;</hi> which two wings are the wings of <hi>Loue</hi> and
<hi>Hope,</hi> wherewith she flyes into Heauen. <hi>Who wil afford
me wings as the Doue?</hi> But yet she would not fly alone,
but draw others also to fly along with her, to wit, the
Apostles, during her life, and through her example
afterwards al other Saints.</p>
               <p>They were accustomed of old, the better to attract
strange pigeons to their houses, to vse this industrie
or slight, to annoynt some one tame and domestical
<hi>Doue</hi> with an oyntment, which they knew most
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:4067:112"/>
grateful vnto them, and so annoynted to let it fly at
large; when she so flying in the ayre, through the
fragrance of the odours about her, would draw to
her a number of them; &amp; so she, who first flew alone,
would returne back againe in triumphing manner.
The <hi>Virgin</hi> of herself alone at first was the onlie louer
of vowed Chastitie, who professed, she knew not,
nor euer would know man. This <hi>Doue</hi> then the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie
Fowler had sent forth into the ayre of the
world, as annoynted with the perfume of al graces,
and especially of Chastitie; but now she flyes with an
innumerable number of Virgins, led by her example,
singing altogeather with one consent that verse: We
<hi>wil runne after the odour of thine oyntments; the yong virgins
haue loued thee, O louelie Doue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, for the sitting of the <hi>Doue</hi> by the waters

great Contemplatour of Celestial Secrets vpon the
<hi>Canticles,</hi> speaking of this most holie <hi>Virgin,</hi> how she
was assumpted to Heauen, sayth: <q>I saw one specious
as a Doue ascending from the waters. She was a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<hi>Doue,</hi> as it were; because she shewed the forme
and simplicitie of that <hi>Doue,</hi> which came vpon <hi>Christ,</hi>
coming out of the streames of waters.</q> Now as the
<hi>Doue</hi> is sayd to dwel vpon the streames, as wel to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
the shadow of the hawke, as to refresh herself
against the heats: So the blessed <hi>Virgin</hi> rests &amp; abides
vpon the fulnes of the flouds of the <hi>Holie-Ghost,</hi> as wel
to admonish her Deuotes to beware the Diabolical
snares, as to enioy the plenitude of the waters of the

whether the waters were fallen and ceased vpon the

of hils appeared bare, yet they remained moist and
slymie, and therefore the <hi>Doue</hi> being a nice and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
bird, and extremly amourous of puritie and
cleannes, would by no meanes put her foot theron.
And heer reflect vpon the <hi>Virgin</hi> pure, in whome no
spot appeared of Original Sinne at al, in that great

in the Ark of her Innocencie Immaculate, because

               <p>Consider then the singular prouidence of the <hi>Doue,</hi>
which is a part indeed of the prudence of this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in that to shun the hawke, she shrouds herself in
the secret holes of the Rock, and there securely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
in great peace. And then consider, how this
<hi>Doue of Doues,</hi> this same most prudent <hi>Virgin,</hi> being
higher then the rest, and more profound, had placed
her nest or chamber in <hi>Christ</hi> her Rock; where being
alwayes safe and kept inuiolable, the slights of the
Diuels and the subtleties of Hereticks could doe
nothing against her; but what they did, was against
the Rock itself, rebounding back vpon the impious
themselues, like the waues against the cliffes, the
ships against the shelfs, the rusling of the winds
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:4067:113"/>
against the towers, the fomie froth against the beach,
the edge of the sword against the Adamant, the reed
against a target, drifts of snow against a helmet, fire
against gold, &amp; lastly a slender cloud against the Sun.</p>
               <p>Ponder lastly the great similitude and resembla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
which is between the saluation of mens liues in <hi>Noës

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ontemplate first, that as an Aqueduct
hath length and breadth with it:<note place="margin">The Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</note> so
our glorious <hi>Virgin,</hi> the <hi>Fountain,</hi> I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
aboue, of liuing waters, as an
Aqueduct hath so great a length, as
she reaches euen from heauen to the
earth; according to that mellifluous <hi>Doctour: Marie</hi>
is an Aqueduct,<note place="margin">S. Ber.</note> whose top like <hi>Iacob's</hi> ladder, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to Heauen. And the breadth of this Aqueduct is
such, as she was able to containe the Diuine <hi>Fountain</hi>
itself, as the same <hi>S. Bernard</hi> affirmes: A <hi>Fountain</hi> is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
to vs,<note place="margin">Idem.</note> because that Celestial veyne hath descended
by the Aqueduct, though not affording vs the whole
plentie of the <hi>fountain,</hi> yet powring out certain stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licides
of grace, into our dry and arid harts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:4067:119"/>
Consider then, that as we can not deriue the waters
of the Heauens into our Conduits on earth, without
some conueyance or other: so can we not expect the
waters of Grace to come from thence without some
Aqueduct of Grace, which is the blessed <hi>Virgin,</hi> the
Incomparable <hi>Fountain</hi> therof; for that, as <hi>S. Bernard</hi>
sayth, the flouds of graces were wanting so long to
human kind, for that as yet no Aqueduct had made
intercession for it. Seeke we therefore grace through
the inuocation of <hi>Marie,</hi> Mother of Grace; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
we offer to GOD, commend we to <hi>Marie,</hi> that
grace may returne back by the same channel, by
which it flowed.</p>
               <p>Ponder lastly the manner how this Aqueduct or
<hi>Fountain</hi> of ours communicates its waters; for
to some she communicates in manner of a Well,
to some againe in manner of a Spring, and thirdly to
others in manner of Riuer-waters. The Well hath its
waters hid in the bottom of the pit, and not to be
drawne without some difficultie: in which manner
she communicates herself to sinners only, to whom
the waters of grace are hidden, but yet to be fetcht
and had with the labour of contrition and pennance.
but the water of the Spring is drawne without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
at al, and flowes continually: and in this manner
she communicates herself to pious Soules and her
Deuotes, because continually she affords them gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with much facilitie; and lastly, as touching the
Riuer, that flowes so with great abundance, she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
and powres forth herself to the Blessed
Soules, with ineffable graces, which are not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable
to mortal wights.</p>

True honour consists in fearing GOD;

is, he that puts generositie in some aboue the rest,

a tedious famine, to fertilize and fructify the earth.</p>
               <p>Nor is <hi>Marie</hi> our <hi>Mount</hi> restrayned to <hi>Moria</hi> only, but

them, from the bondage of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> through

And so was the Blessed Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> as the Queen

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:4067:125"/>
is a fountain and spring of flouds; while on the foot
therof, two fountaines arise, the one <hi>Ior,</hi> the other
<hi>Dan;</hi> which sliding &amp; falling into one, do make the
<hi>Iordan</hi> at last, as <hi>S. Hierom</hi> sayth. So our Incomparable
<hi>Virgin</hi> is truly a <hi>Libanus</hi> likewise of endles &amp; indeficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
waters, whose graces and fauours continually flow
to Mortals; nor can those springs of hers be euer dry,

               <p>Consider then, that as <hi>Mount Libanus</hi> is a <hi>Mount</hi> of

<hi>Like Libanus hauing the odour of sweets.</hi> For there are trees
that beare the incence,<note place="margin">Ec. 39.</note> and many odoriferous herbs

with the Incence of sublime prayer and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the perfumes of sanctitie &amp; holie conuersation,
the mirrh of mortification &amp; memorie of death,
while her life was nothing els, but a continual lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor
of perpetual mortification, as wel in denying
herself the pleasures, contentments, and delights of
the world, as in sighing &amp; groning so much after hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
where her whole conuersation was. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is it sayd in the <hi>Canticles: Fly my beloued, resemble the

               <p>Ponder lastly, that as <hi>Libanus</hi> is interpreted white,
for the candour of the snow, which perpetually co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers

exquisit painter, in the Age immediatly following,
would needs draw her pourtraict, though he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
seen her while she liued: &amp; therefore gathered he

whatsoeuer he found rare and excellent in anie, he
would exactly put into his peece, not leauing, til he
had finished a most admirable peece of work, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neated
from them, which euen rauished the eyes and
harts of al. So may we say of our blessed Ladie, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the eternal King, that she was an abstract of al
the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s possible, dispersed not only in that sex,
or the huma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kind, but euen likewise in the Angelical

of al perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; since both her name, in the Hebrew,
sounds as much as <hi>Sea;</hi> and as the <hi>Sea</hi> is nothing els,

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> so is she
no lesse an assemblie and congregation of al graces
and perfections to be found elswhere.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sea</hi> indeed hath three properties; It is the Spring
and origin of al fountains; it is alwayes ful; and is bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and brackish in tast. Our Ladie likewise is the
spring and origin of al graces, from whose virginal
womb did IESVS flow, the fountain of this Fountain,
the increated Grace, from the plenitude of whose
grace, we al receaue grace, in what measure soeuer
we become capable of. And as from the sea do flow
great quantities of waters which it receaues againe,
not being kept; so do graces flow fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Marie</hi>
in great plentie; yet with flowings and ebbings,
through our ingratitude, and not making vse therof.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:4067:129"/>
But if after our neglect of her fauours we returne,
as we ought, to beg them againe, though we receaue
no effectual benefits by her first offers which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
yet doth she dayly offer them againe; with this
differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce from those flowings of the liquid seas, that
they go and come to and fro of course, and at certain
times with stints; but she is readie euerie moment to
communicate her fauours without limits, so we wil
but open the chanels of our harts to let them in.</p>
               <p>As al Wels, Springs, and Fountaines deriue from
the <hi>Sea,</hi> the <hi>Sea</hi> virtually containes the nature and
qualities of al Well-springs, current fountaines, and
riuers. By which waters are aptly vnderstood the
three degrees of graces, which through our Ladie
flow into our harts; to wit, the Incipient or preue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
grace, in the first beginnings of our conuersio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s;
the Proficient, by which we proceed; to vertuous
actions through grace receaued; &amp; the Perfect grace,
which is the ful consummation therof, and is indeed
a constant perseuerance to the end in al vertues. This
Incipient or commencing grace, is signifyed <hi>by the
Well</hi> or spring <hi>of liuing waters;</hi> because these springs
haue their waters secret &amp; hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder ground; they
suddenly arise, and no man knowes from whence, &amp;
so preuenient grace, is by vs not merited at al, but
springs, and is powred into vs, through a secret and
hidden inspiration of GOD, no man can tel how, or
whence, but often comes through the intercession of
the Inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable <hi>Mother</hi> of mercie, and the <hi>Sea</hi> of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
being called the liuing Waters, for that by this
grace, are sinners dead in sinnes, as viuifyed to life.
The Fountain-water, is vnderstood to be grace Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t;
wherof is sayd: the <hi>Fountain of the Gardens;</hi> which
gardens of GOD, are the good Proficients in grace, &amp;
vertues; in whome are the hearbs &amp; plants of al ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:4067:129"/>
in a flourishing state; which yet could not spring
at al, nor grow a whit, much lesse seeme to prosper &amp;
flourish, vnles by this fountain they were watered
with grace, being a <hi>Fountain indeed ascending from the
earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>which waters the vniuersal face therof.</hi> By the Riuer-water,
which flowes with viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, is perfect grace to
be vnderstood, which is sayd <hi>to flow with violence,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
such as are replenished therwith, are very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest

               <p>The <hi>Sea</hi> is alwayes ful, and neuer wasts; and so our
Ladie was announced by the Angel, to be ful of
grace, as truly she was a vast and immense <hi>Sea</hi> of al
graces. Of whom the mellifluous <hi>S. Bernard</hi> sayth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

&amp; confounded for want of wine; she had compassion
of the <hi>Iewish</hi> nation, while she saw them to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate

seing them dispersed in the passion of her Sonne; But
especially was she bitterly sorie at the passion of her
Sonne, when the sword of sorrow tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sfixed her hart;

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ontemplate first, that when the world was
first created, &amp; that the waters were diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as it were,<note place="margin">The Contem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plation.</note> by the Firmament, while
part was put aboue the Firmament and
part beneath, the waters beneath on the earth, were
called by the name of <hi>Maria,</hi> or <hi>Seas;</hi> and the Spirit of
GOD, as we haue it in <hi>Genesis, did incubare super aquas</hi>
couer, as we say, or ouershadow the waters: Which
was a work of the first Creation. So in the work of
our Redemption, where the blessed Virgin, <hi>Maria</hi> by
name, which signifyes the <hi>Seas</hi> also, it pleased the
Eternal Word, leauing the delicious bosome of the
heauenlie <hi>Father</hi> to descend into this <hi>Sea,</hi> of human
miseries to take them vpon him; and the <hi>Holie-Ghost</hi>
likewise to ouershadow her withal.</p>
               <p>Consider then in the Temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> that as besi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
other riches and ornaments there, as the Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatorie
aboue; the Cherubins and Seraphins of each
side therof, the golden Candlestick in the midst, the
Altars of Perfumes and of Propitiation, heer and
there, with the lamps, the Veyle, the Ark, and the like
in their places, was planted a great vessel of Brasse,
ful of water, at the entrance of the said Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, where
the Priests were to cleanse themselues, before they
entred to Sacrifice; and this Vessel was called, <hi>Mare
aeneum,</hi> or the <hi>brazen Sea.</hi> So ought the Priests in our
Churches before they enter or approach vnto the
dreadful Sacrifice of al Sacrifices, the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the
<hi>Masse,</hi> to recurre to this <hi>Mare aeneum,</hi> our Blessed <hi>Ladie,</hi>
to procure them a puritie of soule, to assist therat, or
approch thervnto.</p>
               <p>Ponder lastly, that as GOD, the soueraigne Lord of
al things, communicates his offices and charges to
men according to his most holie and Diuine dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:4067:131"/>
very suitable and agreable to euerie one: as to
<hi>Moyses</hi> the office of a Law-giuer to his people of <hi>Israel;</hi>
to <hi>Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> the office of high Priest; to <hi>Iosue,</hi> of Captain &amp;
Leader of them into the land of promise; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
gaue them talents accordingly to discharge
the same very punctually in al things. So is it likelie,
that in choosing his Mother, he vsed the self-same te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in his fayre dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof, to wit, in appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her so to be the <hi>Starre</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> he ordeyned her
no doubt to be the Ladie of the <hi>Sea,</hi> as her name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.
Now then as in the <hi>Seas,</hi> he hath drencht and
plunged, as it were, an other world, since there is no
liuing creature but hath its like in the <hi>Sea</hi> also impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citiuely,
he hath likewise appointed her to be the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and Mistris of al the world. For how should she
saue from shipwrack, if were not Ladie &amp; Mistris of
the waues and winds? And how should she be Ladie
of the <hi>Seas</hi> alone, if she were not the Ladie likewise of
the land? Since she who is stiled the Ladie of the <hi>Seas,</hi>

she hath wel planted with Canons and Sacres, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
she more confides, then manie do in Sacred Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons;
her whole saluation depending vpon them. It
is a litle Common-wealth, whose whole Reason of
State consists in iealousies, &amp; spyes, which she sends

vp to her turret-tops, to discouer, if the coasts be
clear, stil standing on her guard, against the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour

al her care is, to walke vpright amidst her enemies,
least vnawares they arrest her, and cite her to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
at Pluto's Court, for euerie errour or default
of the least ship-boy. There is no Bride requires so
much time to dresse her on her wedding-day, as she
to be rigd, whensoeuer she goes to sea. If they haue
their fillets to bred and wreath their haires with, she
hath her tacklings to trim her vp; whose ropes are as
manie &amp; as intricate as they; if they haue their veyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es

in euerie mouth a Serpent tongue, that spits &amp; vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits

strouts it out, as brauing euen the Elements them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,

bnt no good diuer at al; which she neuer doth,
but sore against her wil, and that with so il successe,

dismisse thy <hi>Reader,</hi> with his Ship
ful fraught with the prayses of
the <hi>sacred Parthenes;</hi> and shutting
vp thyself in this <hi>Parthenian</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
walk in it vp and downe by
thyself alone, without eye or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter,
to witnes the secret aspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of thy hart; while contemplating with thyself,
this great rich Magazin of the treasures of Nature,
enclosed in this spacious and ample GARDEN of our
SACRED PARTHENES, thou enter into thyself a while,
gathering the fruits and flowers, at least of good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
from the obiects themselues. Not be a whit dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayd,
though they put thee to the blush, to be
taught thy dutie so, from irrational and insensible
things; but yeald and submit thy hart, to learne of
each creature, how to serue the common <hi>Creatour</hi> of
vs al. And as thou walkest vp and downe, taking a
view of those curious knots of euer-flourishing and
green hearbs, say this vnto thyself: When shal I order
and compose my greener and inordinat affections in
so faire and goodlie a <hi>decorum,</hi> and so sweet propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Walking in the Allyes, say: Lord, conduct me
by the streight and readie way; and shew me thy
kingdome. Noting the neatnes of those walkes, how
trim and smooth they are, say: When shal it be, I be so
curious, to purge and take away the impurities from
my hart? The great diuersitie of flowers, wil present
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:4067:138"/>
to thee, the great multiplicitie and wel-nigh infinitie
of thy thoughts, as various as numerous, &amp; al as tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitorie
as they. If thou seest a swarme of Emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts at thy

and carrying them with toyle, vnto their litle Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries,
one groaning with his load, another newly
discharged therof, most lightly and nimbly running
for another, say vnto thyself: Oh slothful wretch,
looke on these people heer, how they labour to
mayntaine that paltrie litle carkas of theirs, of smal
continuance; and thou to mayntaine thy soule, in
good estate, so created for Eternitie, art so litle labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and industrious. When thou beholdst the trees,
ful loaden with their fruits, so faine to be shored vp
beneath; remember the menace of fire, the Sauiour
made against the barren tree. When thou seest the
plants, to be watered so, against the scor ching of the
Sun, thinke and say inwardly in thyself: When shal,
we with our teares appease the auenging Wrath of
the Diuine Iustice? The faire and beautiful Pansyes,
but without al sent or odour, wil tel thee, of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
agitations of thy soule; the Tyme, the
bitternes of displeasures; the Poppie, that lulles the
soule a-sleep, wil admonish thee of the sweet exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
and rauishments of heauenlie Contemplation,
thou neglectest so much; the Rubarb, or hearb called
Patience, wil put thee in mind of that Vertue, which
giues it the name; the Balme, of a good and faire
reputation. Nor stay thou heer, but runne to resalute
the proper and peculiar Familie likewise the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Symbols of the <hi>Sacred Parthenes,</hi> so mentioned
aboue; and note the documents they wil yeald thee,
for thine owne behoof; and then take thy leaue of
al. The <hi>priuate Garden</hi> wil teach thee to keep thy

vertues close, if thou hast anie; and not very easily
to loose their odour, through a voluntarie publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
the same to others. Saluting the <hi>Rose,</hi> enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with thorns, think, there is no contentment to
be found, without displeasures. Beholding the <hi>Lillie</hi>
among bryars, imagin Chastitie is so conserued
amid austerities. The <hi>Violet</hi> wil figure thee a low
and humble esteeme of thyself; which yet is a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
and delicious flower. The <hi>Heliotropion,</hi> which
hath alwayes its look to the Sun-wards, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
it by day, and closes vp agayne with the
night, wil put thee in conceipt of the true Sun of
Iustice indeed thou oughtst to follow, and should
be the whole obiect of thy soule. The <hi>Deaw,</hi> that
falles from Heauen, wil remember thee of the
heauenlie graces, that were shed and distilled from
Heauen, by the coming of the <hi>Holie-Ghost</hi> in forme of
fierie tongues. The busie and industrious <hi>Bee,</hi> which
bounds and rebounds so aloft in the ayre as she
flyes, wil cal to thy mind, those words of thy great
Maister: <hi>Work, and negotiate while tune lasts.</hi> The
<hi>Heauens,</hi> wil attract thy thoughts, to heauenlie
things; the <hi>Rain-bow,</hi> moue thee to pardon iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and immediatly to reconcile thee, to thine
enemies. The <hi>Moon</hi> wil tax thee of inconstancie,
like to hers; the <hi>Starre, rayse</hi> vp thy thoughts to a
vertuous emulation, to become a <hi>Starre</hi> indeed,
in the heauenlie Hierarchie, as it is so fixed
in the celestial Firmament. The <hi>Oliue</hi> wil
warne thee, to be alwayes green in thy good
purposes, and fruitful in good works. The
<hi>Nightingal,</hi> wil let thee heare a taste or relish, as
it were, of the heauenlie Quiers, and sacred
Alleluya's, sung by the Angels in Heauen. The

               <hi>Palme,</hi> wil stirre thee to Martyrdome; at least, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

the heauenlie mansions and Tabernacles into thy

that of the Heauenlie Kingdome. The <hi>Doue,</hi> wil retire
thee, and draw thee into solitude. The <hi>Fountain,</hi> wil

mentioned, that spring to eternal life. The <hi>Mount,</hi> wil

Where you must note, that these are but they
only, which wayte and attend vpon her, in her GAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEN;
and that she hath infinit other Clients and
Deuotes besides, in created things, as forward al, to
offer vp themselues, in her seruice; I meane, in this
Symbolical Theologie, to giue forth Elogies, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums,
and Panegyricks, to her sacred prayse. For
testimonie wherof, you might obserue, the GARDEN
being shut vp, two noble creatures likewise, though
too late, to be admitted with the rest, to come in
with their Deuises and Emblemes, to expresse no
lesse in her honour, then the rest had done. But the

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Phenix,</hi> is the <hi>Cesar</hi> of birds,<note place="margin">The Inpresa.</note> and sole
Dictatour amongst them, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
no <hi>Pompey</hi> in his kind: &amp; therefore
Nature hath framed but one at once,
to take away the cause of ciuil iarres.
He is the miracle of Nature, and a prime maister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece
of her workmanship; wherin she seemes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to her custome, to shew some art. He is euen
the honour of <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> or the felicitie of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
the of-spring of the Sun, that might wel haue
been his father, if either two Suns had been possible,
or two <hi>Phenixes</hi> at once. He is a Treasurer, or rather
an Vsurer of spices, with the interest of his life. He
is the Heyre apparant to himself, and feares no
other's clayme to that nature; bred of ashes, and, as
we al, to ashes must returne againe; and yet immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
while he dyes not, but renewes rather; and not as
the Hawke, which mewes his feathers only, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
The Tomb is his cradle, the Fire his midwif,
himself the Damme, the Sun his Sire. There being but
one at once, they are framed without a pattern, and
yet so like, as they are taken for the same. He can
speake much of others Ancesters, but nothing of his
owne. He is the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of his kind, the first
and last, because alwayes the same. Being solitarie,
he is apt to scruples, but puts them ouer through the
innocencie of his life; for though by nature he be a
Prince, yet dares he not say We, because there is no
more then he. If he steale, they are but spices, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he makes no conscience, because for his Altar
of Holocausts; nor hath anie Casuist with him, to
put that scrupule into his head. And being so acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:4067:141"/>
to his owne death, he makes as litle scruple of
that also, as done through the inspiration of Nature,
as he calles it, to maintaine his House, and to rayse
his seed. Were he not wel knowne otherwise to the
<hi>Arabians,</hi> to be a bird, by manie faire demonstrations,
it had been a wonder, that people had not chosen
him for a GOD. But GOD, it seemes, would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it, as a special fauour to this singular and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Bird. Like the Camelion, he liues by the ayre;
and no maruel, the spirit of birds should liue of its
proper Element, the ayre being the Eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of birds,
as the waters of the fish. The Fire he makes his Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie
in this world; and that so efficaciously, as he
becomes renewed to an other life, or like the Snake,
which changing his coat only, is stil the same, but
yet more fresh. Whereby obseruing the precept, <hi>he
puts off the old man, to be take him self to a new being, in
newnes of life.</hi>

Siren of the Brook;<note place="margin">The Impresa</note> the liuing
Ghost, that walks and hants those humid
playnes, as if confined to her <hi>Eliseum</hi> there.
She is much taken with the pleasant banck of the
Continent, and spends much time therin, but yet wil
not trust it with her houshold, nor there be brought
to bed, but rather hires some Iland for the purpose; &amp;
the rent she payes, is some part of her children. She
likes to haue her walks and gardens there, for her
delights; but her mansion-house, for more securitie,
wil she haue wel gyrt with an ample and spacious
Moat. It is strange to see, how solitarie she liues; and
yet otherwise, you would think her, though she see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
highly to affect that life, made for Citties and
the Court; her clothing al, saue her Spanish-leather
buskins, from top to toe, of the richest
Mineuers; her gate, statelie and Maiestical; her
garb and fashion, graue, yet not affected, or
sprung from an ouer-weening of herself. She rather
pitties the companie of men, and their good
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:4067:144"/>
fellowships, as feastings, bancketings, and pastimes,
then hates them for it, and so neglects them rather,
with a demisse eye, then with a brow contracted, or a
lookmore Cinick, to appeare <hi>Diogenes,</hi> or a <hi>Tymo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of men, rather then the deboishments of their ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
As she is solitarie and melancholie by nature,
she is very Musical, as likely are al such; but chiefly
doats she on the wind-instruments, and is neuer seen
without her Howboy; wherewith, when she list,
wil she enchant the verie Sirens themselues with the
melodie she makes; but then especially, when fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the chimes of her passage out of this world to
sound within her, as a presage of her death to others,
she wil ring forth such a peale of delicious and chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
straines mixt togeather, as would moue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
in the hearers rather, then compassion, while
they wil iudge streight, she had a pure soule of her
owne. She is a right Hermitesse; and hath her sallets
proper to herself alone; and as she loues them wel,
she wil feed of no man's picking, but her owne.
Other whiles she liues in state, and keeps her kitchin,
as the manner is in some places, in the Cellars, and
lower roomes; which by reason of the moystnes of
those places, are alwayes vnder waters; but she likes
them neuer the worse for that, but rather so much
the better; for so she feeds on her sallets very fresh,
but new-gathered. She is further much delighted, to
take her pleasure on the waters, for her meer dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and recreation; and wil haue no other boat, then
her owne Barge, nor other oares then her owne; and
being so good a Swimmer, makes a pastime of it, to
tilt her boat quite ouer head and eares. She is very
hale, and hath a long breath, and wil keep her head
vnder water, longer then any Moor shal doe, that
hunts for pearls.</p>
