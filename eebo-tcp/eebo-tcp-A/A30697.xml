         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

At our meeting we took into our conſideration, that beyond the ſea, <hi>viz</hi> the <hi>Lowcountries,</hi> by ſetting their poor on work, moſt of thoſe evils are removed and remedied, and thoſe places bleſſed of God and inriched: And likewiſe that in ſome Towns in this our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is not a begger or idle perſon to be ſeen, as <hi>Norwich, Ipſwich, Dorcheſter</hi> and other places, to their great honour, and that in this City is nothing wanting which thoſe other parts and places doe enjoy, that might conduce to the regulating and effectuall relieving of the poor: yet that we might the better herewith poſſeſſe our ſelves, and be the better able to poſſeſſe and perſwade others, we did deſire every man to deliver in writing, his thoughts, which way it were beſt, and might be done with moſt advantage; the which was performed, and thoſe propoſitions brought in, were by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

The Common Counſell granted what we deſired, and withall ordered that Committee to conſider of an Act made ſix or eight years before, with an intent to create a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that ſhould take care to ſee the Laws and Statutes concerning the poor, put in execution: The ſaid Committee after many meetings and much debate, did agree that it was neceſſary that there ſhould be a Corporation made conſiſting of eight Aldermen, and thirty two Commoners, Freemen of the City, choſen out of each ward reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, and to that end drew a draught, which being agreed upon, after many alterations by councell, is by M. <hi>Maynard</hi> and M. <hi>Hayle,</hi> Counſellors at Law, in a ſhort draught perfected and approved as fit to paſſe the Houſe, and to eſtabliſh a Corporation, who might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gain an enlargement of power, as occaſion ſhould require.

But through the multitude of their affairs, and length of the Ordinance, we could not in ſix moneths procure it to be read and committed, whereupon by adviſe we drew up a ſhort petition and repreſentation of our complaints and deſires to the Houſe of Lords.</p>
            <p>The Lords readily embrace this pious and charitable work, and to their great honours within fourteen daies cauſed an Ordinance to be drawn up, and the ſame ſoon after concluded, and ſent down unto the Commons, which was likewiſe by them committed and perfected: and ſent down to the right Honourable <hi>John Warner,</hi> then Lord Major of <hi>London,</hi> and the Corporation appointed for that purpoſe, to put in execution the afore-mentioned Ordinance, which Ordinance I have here inſerted.</p>

at hand, which he did accordingly, and ſomewhat wet his breech, but all this nothing prevailed; untill the aforeſaid Divine having obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the former paſſages, and what was the relation of the maids, tried his experiment upon him, which was thus, cauſed him to be laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his back, and kneeled upon his breſt, with one of his knees, cauſing one of his legs to be drawn forth (if poſſible) which was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly done, and ſo the other; having both his legs thus ſuddenly ſtraitned (without any miracle) he was lifted up upon his feet, to try if he could or would go, which preſently he did in the ſight of them all (though ſeemingly very feeble) The Divine having ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered him, ſends haſtily for a Conſtable to ſend him to the houſe of correction, and in the mean while the fellow deſired the people to ſtand further off him, and he would try his utmoſt to mend his pace, which the people having done, he as haſtily runs away, leapt over a gate and eſcaped them all.</p>
               <p>That ſome way be ſetled, that the food of the City of <hi>London</hi>

               <p>That the Acts and Statutes for ſowing of Hemp and Flax be put in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> execution, and enlarged if need ſhall require, which will much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the good of the poor, and the raiſing of ſtock for the eaſe of the Kingdome.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, Some can work but will not; make them work and their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> labour will maintain them.</p>

               <p>Sixtly, For this City, 'tis needfull to provide four work houſes, and them to be diſtinguiſhed, the eaſt, weſt, north, and ſouth workhouſes, and to divide the City into four parts accordingly, for one or two Pariſhes are not ſufficient for a work-houſe, to build it, to furniſh it, to maintain manufactures in it.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, As alſo to diſtinguiſh your poor belonging to each quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by badges, to prevent ſtraglers.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, It is neceſſary likewiſe to appoint a place in each Ward, to receive ſtuffe from their <hi>Generall ſtore-houſe,</hi> for ſuch as work at home, and to receive in the work ſo wrought back again, paying for the ſame according to the worth thereof, for the better eaſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of the ſaid indigent poor and of the Corporation; as alſo to receive ſuch food as might be frugally ſaved, and prudently or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, multiplied and diſpoſed in ſuch ſort, as that it may be ſufficient to ſtop the mouths of ſuch as complain, We are almoſt ſtarved; and prevent the mention of that ſad diſeaſe in the weekly bills of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
               <p>Ninethly, For the better effecting of the former rules, its neceſſary that a Regiſter book be kept for the poor in each Ward, and each Pariſhes poor be diſtinctly ſet down with their charge and abilities, and that they be truly repreſented by ſome appointed and ſworn for that purpoſe, and thoſe ſeverely puniſhed if they fail, for their neglect and perjury in a matter of that conſequence.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, That certain known rules for relief be ſet down, the family of four children to be provided for before that of three, ſo that ſome receive not all, others none at all, as now it is; but following the wiſe counſel of our fore-fathers, diſcovered by their good Laws, donations and foundations, or the laudable practice of other parts of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and elſewhere.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, That care be taken, that by releeving one poor we make not another, as is 1. The very forme of government in Bridewell, by

By allowing multiplicity of Ale-houſes, to the relief of a few, and the utter undoing of many. 3. By allowing Hucſters, by means whereof our poor houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers (eſpecially) buy their food at the third or fourth hand; with Coſtermongers and ſuch like callings, that tend only to the ſpoil of young fruit, and enhancing the price of old; the exceſſe of Bruers, and abuſe of bakers, which produce the like inconveniences.</p>
               <p>Twelfthly, A conſultation with the ſeverall Trades of <hi>London,</hi> what their grievances are, and how they may be remedied; our fathers have left us foot-ſteps of their care herein, as appears in the grant to Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, to regulate diſorders in their trade for ſeven miles round about <hi>London,</hi> and divers Laws and orders tending to uphold the well-being of Joyners, Carpenters, Painters and other trades in and belonging to this City.</p>
               <p>Thirteenthly, A courſe be taken for removing that ſleight or trick in Law (called <hi>Miſtaking the Caſe</hi>) and the trying cauſes according to the truth of the matter, all circumſtances impartially conſidered.</p>
               <p>Fourteenthly, A courſe for preventing of cheating by morgages, Judgements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which multitudes of families are undone; and buying lands in other mens names, and compounding their own debts, making that land not liable to ſatisfie their creditors; which things conſidered and removed, would doubtleſſe produce much good to this City and the whole Kingdom.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, By gift of Victuals gathered at every houſe thrice in the week, by ſome honeſt perſons appointed for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By loan of Monies from ſome well-affected perſons, and to be repaid them at the years end, either in money or ſuch commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as they ſhall like of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:30772:15"/>Fiftly, By taking the benefit of ſome penall Statutes.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, By concealed Legacies given to charitable uſes.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, The goods and money of Pentioners that die, at leaſt ſuch as have no children, to go to the common ſtock (as it is in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>)</p>
               <p>Eighthly, By gifts of old clothes, ſhooes, boots, hats and the like, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered quarterly at every houſe, by ſome honeſt perſon appointed to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Ninethly, By Contributions of well-affected perſons at the time of their death, being preſſed thereto by the Miniſters that viſit them in their ſickneſſe.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, The aſſiſtance of ſuch perſons as will take off ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of poor, by imploying them in their ſeverall Trades, which will be as effectuall as ſo much ſtock.</p>
               <p>And if all that will not do, it were better ſell all the bells in our ſteeples, then that ſo good and ſo great a work ſhould fail (it were but a little muſick loſt, and happily many lives ſaved) the value of the bells in <hi>London,</hi> accounting four in a ſteeple one with another, and thoſe at twenty Pound apeece, would in one hundred twenty two Pariſhes, amount unto nine thouſand ſix hundred and ſixty Pound: or could we but perſwade the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> but one year to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear altering their apparell into other fantaſtick faſhions, and lay by as much for the poor as they uſe to ſpend that way, it is clearly belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſame would amount to four times as much as the rates of the poor come to. But what need theſe ſhifts? how or wherewith are the poor now maintained? few working, moſt playing, begging, ſtealing, whoring, cheating and the like? can theſe by their ſhifts now live? and could they not much better live by honeſt labour? eſpecially if work, if ſtock and other helps were added to them, eaſie to be procured, if not already in our power to give and grant. I beſeech you let this City no longer plead excuſe, and live under this ſin and ſhame: leave off pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring your friends to places and priviledges, to gifts and other helps, and let the deſtitute of friends periſh before your eyes, and go effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually about the work, elſe when I ceaſe further to pleade the cauſe of the poor, God take the cauſe into his own hand, and it prove bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe in the end.</p>
               <p>And now to conclude all, as I never intended to ſatisfie every man that ſhall reade or hear what is here ſet forth, ſo ſhall I not regard
