            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I can't tell how a Miniſter can promiſe himſelf any Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in his Endeavours, if the Parents will not believe themſelves obliged (as certainly they are by God's Commands) to educate their Children well, and bring them up in the Fear and Nurture of the Lord; and by their Care at home in private, fit them for thoſe farthèr Inſtructions they
<pb facs="tcp:100705:3"/>
are to receive in publick, at the appointed Opportunities. <hi>They</hi> are to ſow the Seeds of Chriſt's Religion in the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Minds, and <hi>He</hi> muſt wiſely cultivate, improve, and nouriſh them; <hi>They</hi> are to lay the firſt Foundations in their Hearts, and <hi>He</hi> muſt build thereon, as God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables him.</p>
            <p>That this might not be a Work of Difficulty, either to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or to Children, nor either of them left at an Uncertainty, the One of Teaching, and the Other of Learning, what they ought, the Church in Her great Wiſdom hath collected in Her Catechiſm, a ſhort, but full and comprehenſive, <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary</hi> of whatſoever a Chriſtian is to believe and practiſe to his Soul's Health, which all her Children are to learn, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and conſider, according to their Age and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This is delivered in ſo clear a Method, in Words and Senſe ſo eaſie and intelligible, that it is not above a very mean Capacity; and yet the Matter is ſo ſolid and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, that it is fit for the ſtrongeſt Underſtanding; the oldeſt Chriſtian in the World need know no more, than what he is to learn there in his Youth, though he will know it better and more fully, the longer he conſiders it; ſo that the Parent, whilſt he is inſtructing the Children in it, will be himſelf a gainful Learner; more and more edified, and grow continually in the Knowledge of his Faith and Duty.</p>
            <p>The Neglect of this preſcrib'd Courſe, has been one great Occaſion, I believe, of that wide Difference there appears of Private Peoples Judgments and Opinions in Matters of Religion; they have taken in different Principles in their Youth, and therefore as their Age advanc'd, have drawn different Concluſions ſrom them, the Effects of which have been exceedingly miſchievous. I do therefore adviſe and deſire you all to teach your Children this judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſound, and truly Chriſtian Catechiſm, that ſavours no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:100705:3"/>
of a Party or private Spirit, but is what they may, and muſt, depend upon to their Lives end.</p>
            <p>When this good Ground-work is well laid, you may with much more Eaſe, form and faſhion them to Vertue and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by putting them in mind of the <hi>Covenant</hi> they have made with God in Baptiſm, by which they ſtand oblig'd to give themſelves entirely up to Chriſt; to look upon him as their only Lord and Law-Giver, their Saviour and their Judge; to believe whatever he reveals, and to fulfil whatever he commands. There alſo you will find the two Tables that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Duty towards God and towards their Neighbour, and both of them explained with the cleareſt Brevity that can be found, from whence you are to take occaſion of exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to a moſt diligent Performance of them, as alſo to rebuke and puniſh the Neglect, or the Tranſgreſſion of them. There alſo they will learn the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> the Prayer that Chriſt himſelf, the Son of God, (who knew the <hi>Father</hi>'s Will, and Man's Neceſſities the beſt of all Men living) taught his Followers to uſe; and therefore it is ſuch, you may be ſure, as is beſt fitted for our Purpoſe, and ſuch as is, both for the Matter and the Manner, acceptable to God the Father. After this follows a ſhort but full Account of the two Sacraments, of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper;</hi> by which they learn the Manner how they themſelves (and all true Chriſtians ever ſince our Saviour's Inſtitution of it) were initiated into Chriſt's Religion, namely by being bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed <hi>in Water, in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> according to Chriſt's Command, explain'd by the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Practice of the Church; inſomuch that they who have at any time denied or refuſed the Matter and the Form of this Sacrament, have not been accounted Chriſtians. Here they ſee alſo what is ſignified by being thus baptized in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, namely, the <hi>dying unto Sin, and living a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>new to Righteouſneſs, i. e.</hi> the repenting of, and forſaking all their
<pb facs="tcp:100705:4"/>
paſt Sins, and living for the time to come, a Righteous and a Holy Life, which is alſo the Meaning of becoming <hi>a New Man, a New Creature, a Regenerate Perſon,</hi> and the like, all which is engag'd for, by every one at his Baptiſm, and is to be remembred, and perform'd for ever after. Here, <hi>laſtly,</hi> they will come to ſee the <hi>End</hi> of the Inſtitution of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, the Cauſe and Purpoſe of its being ordained, namely, <hi>For the continual Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Sacrifice of the Death of Chriſt, and of the Benefits which we receive thereby, i. e.</hi> to put them conſtantly in mind, that Chriſt the Lord was crucified upon the Croſs; that this his Death was an attoning, expiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and accepted by God as ſuch; that for its Sake and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit his Anger is appeas'd, he is now reconcileable to all that will repent them of their Sins, and forſake them, and obey the Goſpel; he will forgive them the Penalty they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd, and will moreover crown them in the World to come with Everlaſting Happineſs. The Remembrance of this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary Death and Sacrifice, and the great Benefits deriv'd to us <hi>from</hi> and <hi>by</hi> it, is the End of this Sacrament's being inſtituted by Chriſt: and therefore to anſwer the End of this Inſtitution, they muſt come to the Sacrament; and when they come, the Bread broken is to remind them of the Body of Chriſt, torn and ſuffering on the Croſs, and the Wine poured out is to remind them of the Blood of Chriſt that was there ſhed; and then they are to call to mind the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100705:4"/>
Upon this Knowledge of the End of the Inſtitution, and of the Benefits that we receive by Chriſt's Death, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains only that the young ones be acquainted with the <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> that is neceſſary to their coming to the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which they will find in the Anſwer to the laſt Queſtion of the Catechiſm, which contains the whole of what they are to do. They are to examine themſelves, <hi>whether they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent them truly of their former Sins,</hi> whether <hi>they ſteadfaſtly purpoſe to lead a new and better Life for the time to come</hi>—whether <hi>they have a lively Faith in God's Mercy, through Chriſt,</hi> i. e. Whether they verily believe that God was ſo exceeding Merciful and Gracious to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that for the Sake of Chriſt's Obedience, Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, he will certainly forgive the Sins of ſuch as ſhall repent and leave them, and whether in full perſwaſion of this Mercy and theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Gracious Promiſes, they ſet about Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: <hi>Whether they thankfully remember Chriſt's Death,</hi> i. e. Whether upon the conſideration and remembrance of the mighty and amazing Miſeries to which their Sins expoſed them, and from which the Death of Chriſt alone has freed them, they do not call to mind this great Deliverance with the greateſt Joy and Thankfulneſs, and bleſs and magnifie the Name of God who hath wrought this wouderful Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for them by the Death of Chriſt, his dear and only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son. And <hi>Laſtly, whether they are in Charity with all Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Preparation (and <hi>all</hi> the Preparation) that is neceſſary to the coming to the Lord's Supper. And if People would be content to learn, wherein this Duty conſiſts, in the ſhorteſt, plaineſt, and the ſureſt Method, they would go no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her than the <hi>Church-Catechiſm;</hi> or if a little farther, it ſhould be but to the <hi>Communion-Service,</hi> in which they will be ſure to find all that is needful or convenient for them to know or do, before, and at, and after this Holy Sacrament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100705:5"/>
I have neither Authority nor Intention to diſcommend or diſallow the uſe of other Books that treat of theſe Matters; but you will take it on my Word, I hope, that the ſhorteſt, and the plaineſt Rules of Direction are ſtill the beſt; that wherein ſoever other Books differ from this, they are not to be depended on: And that multiplicity of Books is apt to beget Confuſion. As far therefore as you will let my Judgment weigh with you, I recommend it to your Care, that you let the Church Catechiſm be the Ground and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of what your Children are to know of the Chriſtian Religion; and that other good Books be call'd in, as Helps to their Devotion only, or to explain the Particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd therein, if they be difficult.</p>
            <p>Whilſt you are teaching, and your Children learning, all theſe Things, you muſt be ſure, of all Things in the World, to go before them with a good Example; <hi>that</hi> is, to recommend, impreſs, and make your Leſſons Credible. They will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, believe, and practice better, if they ſee you live as you teach them to live. Let them know you pray to God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly with your Family; that you love and exerciſe Truth, and Honeſty, and Juſtice in all your Dealings; let them hear and ſee you chide your Servants, and Dependents, for every Lye they tell, and every Fraud and Falſhood they are guilty of: let them never hear you ſwear, or curſe, or ſpeak any Thing diſreſpectfully of God, or Providence, or Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, or any thing of Religion; and they will then believe you are in earneſt, and be more careful of doing as you bid them, and more fearful of offending. Let them ſee you go your ſelf to Church upon the Lord's Day, and as many of the Family as can be ſpar'd, with your Convenience, and there behave themſelves as becomes the Servants of God in his own Houſe and more immediate Preſence: And let them never ſee, even in the after Part of that good Day, any thing Light Extravagant, or Rude, but ſomething of Reſpect and Honour
<pb facs="tcp:100705:5"/>
ſhewn to the good Exerciſes that are over, and to the Day devoted by the Church of Chriſt to God's Service. Away with that ſevere, ſullen, moroſe Religion, with which ſome <hi>Judaizing</hi> and miſtaken Chriſtians paſs that Day on one Hand, and that prophane, contemptuous, court-like Obſervation of it on the other; but let a decent, Chriſtian, and good natur'd Carriage, temper theſe Extreams; that your Children may neither dread the approach of Sunday above other Days, nor yet long for it, as a Day of Sloth and Idleneſs.</p>
            <p>I hope I may, without Offence, take this Occaſion to deſire ſuch of the Separation as are within my Pariſh, to take all Care they can, that both their Children and their Servants go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them to the Places where they ſerve God themſelves, or to ſome other certainly, and require an Account of their ſo doing, that the <hi>Liberty</hi> of abſenting themſelves from their Pariſh-Churches, indulg'd to them by <hi>Man's Law,</hi> be not turn'd to the <hi>Libertiniſm</hi> of ſerving God no where, and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Prophaneneſs find thoſe People whom the Church looſes. We muſt indeed, on all ſides, be ſollicitous leſt he who ſowes Diviſion amongſt us, reap the Fruits thereof, and be the greateſt Gainer; of this, in earneſt, there was never greater need than now, for Chriſtianity and good Morality had never more, or greater Enemies; and therefore all our joint Endeavours will be little enough to oppoſe the ſoft In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations of their ſecret Underminers, and the moſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and bold Attacks of their avowed and open Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. I am ſorry we can date the mighty Growth and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of theſe Miſchiefs within the Compaſs of ſo few Years, when we were hoping ſtill for better Things. But let this evil State provoke us to a greater Care and Zeal in the Defence of Vertue and Religion, for the future.</p>
            <p>You muſt all of you help to make this ugly Digreſſion perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and uſeful, by taking all imaginable Care to breed up a Generation better than the preſent, and ſuch as may do

theſe wicked Days all the Diſgrace and Shame they can, by a moſt firm adherence to the Chriſtian Faith, by a lively Senſe of Virtue and Religion in the Soul, made manifeſt by a moſt Virtuous and Religious outward Practice.</p>

            <p>THE Education of Children is, and hath always been accounted, a thing of ſuch Importance, that all who have at any time diſcourſed or written of Government, have found themſelves obliged to dwell parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly on that Subject. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thinks it a matter of ſuch moment, that he poſitively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines it ought not to be left to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents choice; but that the Publick (whoſe eſpecially the Children are) ſhould be entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only with that Charge: and <hi>Plato</hi> lays down ſuch ſevere Rules, that 'tis a queſtion whether they were ever practicable, or only fitted to his fanſied <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> And indeed, conſidering that they are the Seed of Empires, Kingdoms, Corporations, and Families, and that the Good and Wellfare of them all, depends entirely on them, there can't be too much care employed about their bringing up: there are ſo many
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100705:7"/>
hazards from the ſenſible and tender diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe nice Plants, from noxious Airs, inclement Seaſons, and their own natural Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riancy, that it requires a great deal of skill to cultivate them as they ſhould, and as they well deſerve. And it is with this proſpect (and a larger one beſides, the World to come) that the Spirit of God hath inſerted ſo many poſitive Commands, and ſo many wiſe Rules of training Children up, into the Holy Scriptures. For though <hi>One</hi> were enough, when found there, to make it our Duty, yet there are <hi>Many</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it farther; and though the Spirit of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd a-like the Herdſman's Son, with <hi>Solomon</hi> the King's, and made them a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>like infallible, in what they ſhould deliver to the World, yet in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance (may be) with our Weakneſs, and the fond Conceits we have of human Reaſon and Underſtanding, it is ſo contriv'd, that there are more Precepts concerning Childrens Education found in <hi>Solomon</hi> alone, than all the Scriptures elſe: that they who take no notice of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, might yet be moved by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the greateſt Wiſdom, and the beſt Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and the thing however done. I am to confine my ſelf to that of my Text, which is as comprehenſive as any: and will,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100705:7"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Explain the Terms of it; And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Shew the Truth of the Propoſitions contain'd therein; And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Make what Application may be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and uſeful.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>Firſt,</hi> of the Terms. <hi>To ſpare the Rod,</hi> in the firſt Clauſe, being oppos'd to <hi>chaſtening,</hi> in the ſecond; by the <hi>Rod</hi> muſt needs be meant, not only that particular Inſtrument of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but every thing beſides that may prove the Means of our Correction and Amendment. And ſo in <hi>Job</hi> 33. 19. <hi>He is chaſtened with pain upon his bed.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 10. <hi>I wept, and chaſtened my ſoul with faſting.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 5. <hi>The chaſtiſement of our peace was on him;</hi> by which is meant the Miſeries, Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Pains, and Torments that our Lord en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured both in Life and Death for our ſakes: and ſo in a great many other places. So that by <hi>Chaſtiſement</hi> is here intended every Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Correction, every Means of effecting what we intend by chaſtiſing. And <hi>to ſpare the Rod,</hi> is, not to uſe thoſe Means, not to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy thoſe Inſtruments for the correcting and amending what we ſee amiſs in Children, which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100705:8"/>
are proper to their Age, ſuited to their Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and proportion'd to their Faults; whether it be Reproof and ſharp Admonition, Reſtraint of Liberty, Diſappointment of their Wills, or corporal Puniſhment: to do (in a word) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is neceſſary, convenient, or becoming the Children and the Parents in their reſpective cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, is <hi>to chaſten,</hi> and to neglect the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, is <hi>to ſpare the Rod.</hi> Let us ſee in the next place, what it is to love and hate one's Son, which are the reſt of the Terms.</p>
            <p>By <hi>loving</hi> and by <hi>hating</hi> is not here meant the exerting actually thoſe Paſſions in the Heart, for then the Text would be untrue: it is by no means likely that an indulgent Parent ſparing of his Child, ſhould actually hate it in his Heart, or that the puniſhing it ſhould be the Effect or Sign of natural Love, for the contrary to this, is moſtly true; the Sparing it is the Fruits of natural Fondneſs and Affection, and the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting it, is not the choice of the Heart, but the effects of a Neceſſity impos'd by Prudence and Conſideration, and Hopes and Fears of what may come to paſs. By <hi>loving</hi> and by <hi>hating</hi> therefore is to be underſtood, the acting agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and not the <hi>Blindneſs</hi> of thoſe Paſſions; the producing ſuch effects as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100705:8"/>
are in God's Accounts, and wiſe Mens too, and in our own when freed from partial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, the Conſequence and Fruits of Love and Hatred acting regularly; ſuch as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly eſteemed the Effects of thoſe two Cauſes, whether they indeed proceed from them or no: So that to love and hate ones Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is to behave ones ſelf ſo towards them, that they and others may be convinc'd we love or hate them, by ſuch Fruits as reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably and ordinarily are the Products of thoſe two Paſſions, whether thoſe Paſſions actually poſſeſs the Heart or no, of which we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince none but our ſelves.</p>
            <p>From the Terms thus explain'd, it will not be difficult, to ſhew, in the <hi>ſecond Place,</hi> the the Truth of the two Propoſitions, how and in what Senſe he may be ſaid to <hi>hate</hi> his Son, that ſpares the Chaſtiſement of him, and how he <hi>loves</hi> him who chaſtiſeth him betimes: For if we are to reckon of Love and Hatred by the Effects, then it is eaſie to diſcern when Parents hate their Children, namely, when either through Neglect or Fondneſs they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to enter on at firſt, or afterwards continue in ſuch Courſes, as will bring them to inevitable Ruine; when by their want of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100705:9"/>
Care, Inſtruction, or Correction, thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren fall into ſuch Miſeries, as the utmoſt Hatred of their moſt profeſt inveterate Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, could neither wiſh nor make them grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; whatever Love there may be at the bottom. What ſignifies the crowning of a Victim with a Garland, when it is ſtill dreſt up to Death? That Mother is as much a Murthereſs who ſtifles her Child in a Bed of Roſes, as ſhe that does it with a Pillow-bear. The End and Miſchief is as great, tho' the Means and Inſtrument be not the ſame. And where two Cauſes will produce the ſame Effect, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Certainty, 'tis no great Matter which of them it is, nor whether you give it a hard or gentle Name. It is all one as if a Parent truly hated his Child, if through his Default, he fall into thoſe Evils, which will naturally work his Miſchief or Undoing; that Fault has the ſame effect that downright Hatred would have had. And then for the <hi>Will,</hi> tho' he can't be ſaid to <hi>will</hi> downright the Evil of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yet if he will the Means which have a natural tendency to produce that End, he is underſtood, in the Accounts of Reaſon, to will the End, and to be guilty of the Evil in a great Degree. And ſo we are ſaid to will
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100705:9"/>
a great many things in Scripture, not that we will them properly, but that we do thoſe things, from whence the others naturally and neceſſarily follow. So God expoſtulates, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 31. and 33. 11. <hi>Why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael!</hi> Not that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> will'd or deſired to die, for that's a thing incredible, if not impoſſible, in the hardeſt Senſe of that Word, but that they willed ſuch things, as would unavoidably bring that Death, and moſt inevitably ruine them. So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 24. <hi>Yea they deſpiſed that pleaſant land.</hi> Not that they diſpiſed or rejected the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> it felf, but rejecting the only Means God had appointed to bring them thither, which were Faith and Truſt in him, and Patience and Obedience to his Laws, they are ſaid to deſpiſe the Land it ſelf. So in <hi>Pro.</hi> 17. 19. <hi>He that exalteth his gate ſeeketh deſtruction, i. e.</hi> He that liveth above his Fortune and Condition, or that openeth wide the Flood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Gates to Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſeeketh Deſtruction; the meaning is, that ſuch a One ſhall <hi>find</hi> Deſtruction, he is as One that <hi>ſeeks</hi> and makes Inquiry after it, and he ſhall ſurely find it. So that Men are not charged with the Miſchiefs only they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend directly, but with ſuch alſo as are like
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100705:10"/>
to follow whether they intend them or not, nay, tho' they ſhould intend the contrary. He who takes the natural and ready Means to any End, is ſtrongly guilty of the evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, altho' he ſhould not only <hi>not</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign that End and Conſequence, but hope and wiſh it might not come to paſs; becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hopes, nor Wiſhes, nor Deſigns can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der natural or moral Cauſes from producing natural and moral Effects. But neither is it only ſo in acting, but in permitting alſo; he is ſaid, upon the ſame Account and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to be guilty of the Evils that enſue, whoſe Duty it was, and in whoſe Power it was, to have prevented them, but did not: It were cruel and unjuſt, to charge a Man with all the Evils he ſhould by Duty prevent, but could not, for want of Power: And it is not always reaſonable, to charge a Man with the Eviis he could by his Power have prevented, but did not, becauſe he was not oblig'd in Duty; becauſe the Signification of Power, in ſuch a Caſe, is to be determin'd by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of Time, and Place, and Perſon, and a great many other Circumſtances of which a Man is only able to judge himſelf: But where Power and Duty meet together, there the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100705:10"/>
is unqueſtionable, and the Neglect of doing what we ſhould and conld is inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The Application of theſe Rules to the Caſe in Hand, is, I think, as evident as the Reaſon of thoſe Rules. It is plain from the Light of Nature, and the uſe of Reaſon, as well as God's Determination in Scripture, that a Parent is oblig'd to educate his Children in the beſt, and moſt religious Manner poſſible, to inſtruct them in all that's Good, and warn them of all that's Evil; and it is as plain from the corruption of our Nature, the perverſneſs of our Wills, and from lamentable Experience, that unleſs this Care be taken, Children will unavoidably be ruin'd; and therefore he who neglects this Education, which he might and ſhould look after, is properly enough ſaid to undo his Children; and as he who ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly ruine his own Children, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly be ſaid to hate them, ſo may he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, who neglects their Education, if ſuch Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect be the natural and ready Way to Ruine, though he don't deſign that Ruine, and though that Neglect do not proceed from Hatred, yet he is ſaid, and properly enough, both to undoe and hate them,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:100705:11"/>
Now the Evils that proceed from a careleſs, or from bad Education, from want of good Inſtruction, of Reproof, Reſtraint, or of due Chaſtiſement in any Kind, are Infinite and Pernicious, they are Numberleſs, and they are Intolerable. I believe it were hard to reckon up any conſiderable Calamity that has befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len a Kingdom, City, Family, or private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but might be juſtly charg'd upon this Head in ſome Meaſure.</p>
            <p>The Reaſoning of <hi>Plato</hi> is both juſt and excellent upon the Education of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and his Son <hi>Cambyſes, Darius</hi> and his Son <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and the following Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and ſhews the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and perfect Correſpondence betwixt the Ways of bringing up thoſe Princes, and the Quality and Fortune of their Government and Kingdoms whilſt they liv'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> having been brought up ſtill in pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and laborious Exerciſes, and in a handſome kind of Equality of almoſt all Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt himſelf and his Companions, his Reign was full of Glory and Succeſs, and every thing that's Good and Laudable. But whilſt himſelf was reaping Palms and Crowns of Victory, he left the Education of his Son to the Ladies
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100705:11"/>
who brought him up in the luxurious ſoftneſs of the <hi>Medes,</hi> where no body durſt ſpeak a word of Truth or Honeſty, for fear of wounding his Ears, which were us'd to nothing but to compliment and flattery. And hence it came, that the Reign and Government of this ſoft Prince was full as Infamous and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate both to himſelf and People as that of his brave Father had been Glorious, Wiſe, and Happy, unto both. <hi>Darius Hyſtaſpes</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards aſcended the Throne, and as his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation had not been in the Delights of a Court, but Hard, and Rough, in Labours and Fatigues, ſo his Reign reſembled in a Manner that of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> both for Glory and for Conqueſt: But whilſt he and his Compeers were ſpreading every where the <hi>Perſian</hi> Honour by their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry and brave Atchievements, <hi>Xerxes,</hi> his Son, was left in Womens Hands, and from them had juſt ſuch another Education as <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſes</hi> had, and reigned accordingly, leaving where'er he came, the ſhameful Marks of a prodigious Power put into the Hands of an ambitious Mad-man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Darius</hi> was indeed a great deal more to blame than <hi>Cyrus,</hi> becauſe he avail'd not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of ſo notorious an Example of Miſcarriage,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100705:12"/>
nor procur'd a better Education for his Son; but that's not the only Uſe that we may make of theſe great Inſtances, one cannot chooſe but ſee, and lament too, that the Fate and Fortune of great Empires, the Wellfare and the Ruine of ſo many Hundred Thouſands ſhould depend upon the Care and the Neglect of a Parent, upon the Improvement or the Sottiſhneſs of one Body. But this would not touch us ſo near we think, if it were not alſo true in leſſer Matters, and as fatal to private Families. The good or evil Education of Children, does not only affect themſelves, but all the Stock and Kindred more or leſs; there is hardly any body ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, but ſome body may be bettered, and ſome body prejudiced by him; there is no body ſtands ſo ſingle and remote, but if he falls, there is ſome one hurt beſides himſelf, directly or indirectly: which as it is a Motive to induce every Relation to ſee after the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Children, as it falls in their Way, ſo it is a ſpecial Argument to Parents, to attend more heedfully to the well educating of their Children, becauſe the Wellfare and the Prejudice of ſo many other People does in a great Meaſure depend thereon. But ſuppoſing the Evil were ſingle, that neither Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100705:12"/>
nor Family, nor Parent were enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged (as they all are) by want of Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet the Evils that befall the Children, are ſo intolerably many, and pernicious both to Soul and Body, that thoſe may well be ſaid <hi>to hate them,</hi> that do not, when they might and ſhould, prevent them.</p>
            <p>Can we ſee a Man that has wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd to Truth and good Faith, ſo entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſs'd with the Spirit of Falſehood, Lying and Deceit, that one knows not how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Word he ſayes, nor how to truſt him with the leaſt Concern? Can we ſee a Man ſo ignorant of God and Goodneſs, of Religion and his Duty, and of all Things Spiritual, that one would think he were newly born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, and had not yet attained the Uſe of Reaſon, nor indeed the Uſe of Speech, and Language; and another ſo exceeding skilful in thoſe Matters, and of ſo ſharp a Wit and penetrating Judgment, that he knows very well that there is no ſuch thing as God and Soul, or any thing but groſs ſubſtantial Matter, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dify'd with great variety? Can we hear ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther talk ſo loudly, and ſo frequently of God, that his Mouth is fill'd with nothing elſe, and yet at laſt it ſhould be all in his Diſhonour
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100705:13"/>
and Defiance, in wounding Oaths, in raging Blaſphemies, and dreadful Imprecations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Temptation, without Pleaſure, without Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; and at laſt without his Knowledge and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign? Can we ſee another vers'd in all the Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Intemperance, practis'd in all the Arts of Luxury and Wantonneſs, and devoted whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to exceſs, a perfect Slave to his voracious Appetite, and whoſe heart and Soul is in his Diſh? Another ſo intoxicated with the Love of Drink, that if 'twere poſſible to drown him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he would, devoting both the Day and Night to that exceſs, having no other Buſineſs, nor other Pleaſure and Diverſion than Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, neglecting all Concerns, forgetting all his Duty both to God and Man, a Reproach to Nature, Scandal to Religion, Uſeleſs to all the ends and purpoſes of living; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but by his bad Example, and the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Conſequences of thoſe Courſes, ruinous to himſelf and Family, and a moſt pernicious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Commonwealth. And another ſo enfeebled by his Luſts, ſo debilitated both in Soul and Body, by his exorbitant Indulgence to thoſe brutal Longings, that he is ſcarce the Shadow of a Man; dull of Apprehenſion, weak in Imagination, failing in Memory, and moap'd
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100705:13"/>
in his Underſtanding. In a word, as impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Mind as Body, and whoſe Soul is as looſe about him as his Limbs.</p>
            <p>Can one ſee, I ſay, theſe, and a thouſand other Evils and Diſorders, with all their ugly Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, reign and rage about the World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and know at the ſame time they are the natural Conſequences of a looſe and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Education, and might in a great meaſure, have been prevented by Advice, Reſtraint, and puniſhing betimes; can one ſee and know this, and doubt at the ſame time, whether our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents hated us or no, who ſhould and could, but would not ſave us from them? What could our greateſt Enemy have done beſides? He would have taken the ſame courſes; for one that he exerciſes as he did <hi>Job,</hi> with Sorrows and Afflictions, he ruines a thouſand by Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences; it is the End he aims at, which is our deſtruction, and 'tis no matter by what means he comes about it. If <hi>Eutrapelus</hi>'s Preſents are ſure to prove as fatal to a weak Mind, as a Dagger in a Man's Heart, or a Glaſs of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his Bowels, what ſignifie the ſhews of Love, and the Pretence of Friendſhip, which prove as deadly as the Aſſaults of open Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? What ſignifies it, that the Child is the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100705:14"/>
Delight of its Parents Eyes, and the Idol of their Hearts; the perpetual Object of their Thoughts, and the perpetual Theme of their Diſcourſe, that they diſcern new Beauties day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in it, ſecret Charms, and Excellencies undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable to all the World beſides; hear Muſick in his Voice, and Wit in every Word, and Grace and Comelineſs in every Action. If Care be not taken to render him as excellent indeed and to himſelf, and as amiable to others, by Vertue, Goodneſs, Sweetneſs and Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as he is to them by an abuſed Fancy. All other Demonſtrations are but Demonſtrations of their own Fondneſs to, and Love of their own ſelf, and end in their own Complacence and Delight. If you would convince another of your Love, it is <hi>he</hi> that muſt feel the effects of it, in and upon himſelf, as well as you. It is otherwiſe like the Charity of good Words, the wiſhing of Alms, and Food, and Raiment, with which a Man may be ſtarv'd with Cold and Hunger. The Love that terminates in Fondneſs, and the little trifling (if no worſe) effects of that, can no more properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Love of ones Children, than the bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the hungry be filled, the thirſty be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and the naked be cloathed, without ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100705:14"/>
thoſe Neceſſities, can be call'd <hi>relieving them.</hi> But the Parallel will hold no farther, for he that relieves not the diſtreſſed, does them at leaſt no harm or injury; whereas the Parent that with all this dotage, takes not care to educate his Children virtuouſly and well, does them the greateſt injury and miſchief in the World; miſpends the only proper time and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Improvement, deprives them of all the Advantages and Opportunities of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming uſeful to the Publick, a Support to the Family, a comfortable Relation, and happy People themſelves: and not only ſo, but expoſes them defenceleſs, deſtitute and naked to abundance of Hazards and Temptations; to a contagious Air in the moſt ſenſible and tender Age; to a vicious World, with vicious Inclinations; to combate with thoſe Foes, with whom our Hearts do naturally conſpire; to meet thoſe Dangers we rejoice to run into; to vanquiſh thoſe Temptations which we ſeek and hunt for; to reſiſt thoſe evils we had rather ſhould prevail than be ſubdu'd; to be left, in a word, to our ſelves, to the Naughtineſs of our own Hearts, and the Dictates of unruly heedleſs Nature, to engage with ſo many Sins, and ſo many Snares, as are commonly a match ſufficient for the greateſt Care, and greateſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100705:15"/>
Watchfulneſs, and greateſt Prudence, together with the ordinary Supplies of God's Grace, is to be ruin'd and undone without peradventure. And if theſe are not true effects of Hatred, if theſe are not the Tokens of the greateſt Ill-will, and the moſt improv'd refin'd Malice, we are yet to learn what thoſe Words mean. And this I hope is ſo evident from the ſenſe of the Thing, from the reaſon of the Words, and from the experience of the World, that there is little occaſion to preſs you with the Authority of the Text, and to inſiſt upon it, that 'tis King <hi>Solomon</hi> inſpir'd by God that ſays, That <hi>he that ſpareth the Rod, hateth his Son.</hi> It will be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what clearer by conſidering the other Clauſe in the Text, and ſeeing what are the effects of Love, which is early Chaſtiſement. <hi>He that loveth his Son, chaſteneth him betimes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have already made appear, that Love and Hatred, in theſe caſes, can only be ſecurely judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by the Effects; not by the Feelings, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Affections of the Parents Heart, but by the Fruits and Conſequences, of which the Children muſt be ſenſible themſelves, and all the World be Judges. For the ground of all this miſchief is, that Parents commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with no body but themſelves, to know if they love their Children, and finding quickly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100705:15"/>
by the Reply their Hearts make, that they love them, as they love their Eyes; they reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the Anſwer, and uſe them indeed as tenderly: whereas they ſhould enquire of Strangers and of wiſe Men, impartial and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd; they ſhould take their Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Reafon and good Senſe, from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the Aged, and ſuch as ſtudy more particularly this Affair; and they would ſhew them, by the effects alone, whether they lov'd or no: the Marks and Tokens of Affection would be viſible in Manners and Inſtruction, beyond the Power of being deceived; and if this be too much, let them learn the Truth, from the Pity of ſome, and the Reproach of others, and from the common Rumours of the Neighbourhood. Every body but themſelves, will tell them, that Love of Children muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by its Effects and Fruits, and no other thing can poſſibly convince another of that Love, though they themſelves are never ſo perſuaded that they do, and to confirm it could be content to die. But of this enough alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and alſo what it is <hi>to chaſten;</hi> it remains that I ſay a word or two of the proper Seaſon, and that is <hi>betimes, he that loveth him chaſteneth him betimes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> either betimes with reſpect to his Age, or with reſpect to his Faults.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:100705:16"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> with reſpect to his Age. It is, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, of great Importance, how we begin, what Grounds we lay, and what Foundation 'tis we build upon: if this be not right, the reſt is but Time and Pains miſpent, and will end in Loſs and Diſappointment. It is as a Man that ſets out falſe, every ſtep that he proceeds, is ſo much out of his way, and he muſt return and begin again. And ſo it is with the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyings of Life; if in our early Youth we ſet out falſe, fall into evil Practices, or be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with pernicious Maxims, it is either a great chance that we never ſee our Errour at all, but blindly ſtill proceed at all adventure; or if we do, we find our ſelves conſtrain'd to begin a-new, to return to the place from whence we firſt fet out, to our intollerable trouble and vexation. What a deal of human Life is ſpent, not in weaving a new web, but in unravelling the old; not in learning new Leſſons of Truth and Vertue, but in unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe of Vice and Falſhood; in forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of evil Principles, and laying down old Prejudices; in ſtripping our ſelves of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd Habits, in parting with our old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances, in forſaking our old Friends, and in a manner tearing out our Vitals, and rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Hearts aſunder: all which might, in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100705:16"/>
great meaſure, be prevented, by an early Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning in the ways of Goodneſs. It was in proſpect of this, that one of the Ancients would have Children accuſtom'd to love and praiſe with delight all vertuous Actions, and deteſt all Vices, even before they attain'd the Uſe of Reaſon, he would have them conſtantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, know them compleatly, and form in their Minds perfect Idea's of them; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that Children are firſt of all affected with the Senſe of Pleaſure and of Pain, he would have them uſed, though never ſo little and young, to take or think there is no Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure but in Goodneſs, Vertue, Temperance, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and the like; nor feel or think there is any great Pain but in thoſe things that are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evil, Vice and Sin. The thing is carried cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly too high, and the Leſſon too refin'd and ſubtil to be put in practice: but the thing he means is this; that the Preventions and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſions of Vertue, Goodneſs, and Religion, ſhould anſwer at leaſt the Prejudices of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Corruption, and that Propenſity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to Folly and to Sin, we bring along with us into this World; that the Artificial Principles of Education, might be of equal poiſe with our original Corruption, till the uſe of our Underſtanding bear down the Scale on
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100705:17"/>
the right ſide: and if it be better to prevent, than cure an Evil, to ſave from Danger, than deliver out of it, then it is better to begin <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> with chaſtening of our Children, to make them wiſe at <hi>our</hi> expence, to let them know no Sin but by deſcription; to hinder them from making an Experiment ſo very unprofitable at beſt, and fatal in the Event, moſt commonly.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Secondly, betimes</hi> is alſo to be underſtood with reſpect to the Fault; the firſt reſpecting Age, would, if 'twere poſſible, prevent the evil, this latter is to put a ſpeedy ſtop to it, to hinder it from growing any farther; the firſt Advice is, to take all care imaginable, that no corrupt or noxious Weeds ſhould ſpring up, in that pure and tender Soil; the ſecond is to root them out betimes, if once they come; ſo that <hi>to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten betimes,</hi> is to ſee, that Puniſhment do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly attend the Crime, before it be forgotten, and before an evil habit be contracted by the frequent repetition of evil Acts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Before it be forgotten; as well that it may not appear to proceed from a delight in Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or to be the effects of ſtudied and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate Cruelty, as alſo that the Fault being freſh in Memory, the Juſtice and Reaſonableneſs of the Infliction may the better appear, and make the deeper Impreſſion on the Mind, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100705:17"/>
raiſe the greater Averſation and Abhorrence of the Thing, that <hi>Impunity</hi> may not breed <hi>Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in</hi> Sin; and that Children may not argue as older People often do, that <hi>becauſe Sentence is not ſpeedily executed againſt an evil Work, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Hearts ſhould be fully ſet in them, to do Evil.</hi> 'Tis a falſe and vicious Way of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but becauſe 'tis obvious, natural, and too too eaſie, it ſhould be ſilenc'd quickly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of its Falſehood; that it may not impoſe on them a ſecond Time.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> and moſt eſpecially, for fear of evil Habits being contracted, the Dread of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is the moſt natural Reſtraint upon the Mind, tis the moſt powerfull Motive to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, the very Life of all Laws, and without which they would be but a dead Letter; and all the Reaſon in the World they ſhould be ſo; for who would obey againſt his Intereſt, or who would practice againſt his inclination, without fear? and who would fear without Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment? according therefore to the Degrees of Impunity, which Men can find or fanſie, will their Obedience to the Laws, or Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience prove. And ſo it is, even in the ſmalleſt Matters that relate to Children, they natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incline the wrong Way, and are kept ſtrait by forcible Coercion; the Dread of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100705:18"/>
is the Reſtraint that lies moſt powerfully upon them, 'tis the Conſideration of that, that is their Motive to Obedience, and the Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that keeps them from offending: and he that removes that Bar, lays them expos'd and open to every Danger and Temptation. But nothing does this more effectually, than ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to ſin at firſt without Reproof and Puniſhment; this ſtrangely leſſens the Guilt and Horrour of their Faults within their own Minds, gives them Degrees of Confidence in Wickedneſs, and makes them think it no ſuch hainous Matter, and venture on it frequently and freely, till it at laſt becomes habitual, and is rooted firmly in them: and then the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is a thouſand times the greater, and the Pains of remedying all theſe Miſchiefs infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more. So that allowing that they <hi>muſt</hi> ſome time or other root theſe Evils out, free them from the Bondage and Captivity of their Luſts and Paſſions, and rid them of all their bad and fooliſh Principles, and ſet them in the Ways of Virtue and Sobriety again, allowing, I ſay, that this muſt needs be done, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be Safe or Happy withont it, nay, that they muſt be miſerable here and more than ſo hereafter. Allowing of all this, it is demonſtrable, that it is not only a Piece of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100705:18"/>
the greateſt <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to ſet about it betimes, but of the greateſt <hi>Mercy</hi> and Compaſſion in the World, even in the Judgment of the tendereſt and moſt pittying Mother. 'Tis like putting <hi>one</hi> to Death, to ſave a Hundred by the Terror of the Example, which may be Juſtice to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, but is in truth a Kindneſs to the reſt. If <hi>one</hi> Reproof and Admonition, will prevent the Occaſion of twenty more, each one as ſharp and terrible, it would be Cruelty to ſpare it. If an early reſtraint of undue Liberty, will prevent Licentiouſneſs hereafter, which muſt be reſtrain'd with Chains and Dungeons, who would not think it a Mercy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd betimes? It is better ſure to break us of our Wills betimes, and to deny us our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions in ſmall and trifling Things, before we can have ſet our Hearts upon them, than to let our Wills and Inclinations gather Strength, and our Affection ſettle and grow firm, <gap reason="illegible: scratched out" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and then begin to fall upon us; the one is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the bending, the other as the breaking, of an Arm. A little Pain, and Trouble, and Uneaſineſs will ſerve at firſt to ſet us right again, when a Continuance in our Evil State, and a contracted Habit, will require a great deal of Patience, and put us to a great deal of Torment. A little Care and a little Strength,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100705:19"/>
will ſerve to keep a young and tender Graft in uprightneſs and order, which if permitted to grow awry for ſome time, muſt ſuffer violence and great diſtortion, before it will be ſtrait again. The older <hi>we</hi> grow in evil Practices and evil Maximes, the older <hi>they</hi> grow too, and take the faſter hold, and root the deeper in us, and conſequently are remov'd with greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So that allowing, that there is an abſolute Neceſſity of their being removed at length it is plain and manifeſt beyond denyal, that it is not only better both for Parent and for Child, that it be done <hi>betimes,</hi> but that it is a Piece of Cruelty both in the one, and to the other, to deferr it, till the vicious Habit is contracted; and conſequently that the Truth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the Text does viſibly appear, <hi>that he that loveth his Son chaſtneth him betimes.</hi> And having done with that, I am now to make Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of what hath been ſaid, and it ſhall be to the Parties here concern'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Parent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Children, and to both in ſhort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To the Parent. To ſhew you the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity there is of bringing up your Children under an early and ſevere diſcipline, the Spirit calls the doing of it <hi>Love,</hi> which is a Term ſo fit and ſo expreſſive, that Nature ſeems to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100705:19"/>
it to Parents in ſuch manner, that they are fond of the Name, even when they have not the Thing; they would be thought to love even when they don't, it lookes ſo like their own, and what they ſhould do: and the Neglect of this he calls <hi>hatred,</hi> a Term from which all Parents naturally abhor. But that you might not be deceived, and make your Judgments from the Paſſions and Affections of your own Hearts, he deſcribes this Love and Hate by ſuch Effects as are not uſually the Products of thoſe Paſſions in the Hearts of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; but ſuch as are ſo in God's Accounts, and wiſe Mens, and Childrens themſelves when they grow up to Years of Underſtanding; and therefore that you ſhould not ſet the movings of your Hearts, and your own fond Opinions and conceits of Kindneſs, againſt the Reaſon, Judgment, and Experience of the whole World, and oftentimes your own: But freeing your ſelves as much as may be, from the Partialities of Nature, and your P<gap reason="illegible: scratched out" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arental Prejudices, deal with your own as freely and as wiſely as you would with the Children of a Forreigner and Stranger, believing there is need of equal Care, and equal Rigour, in treating with your own as you can viſibly diſcern there is, in treating with anothers. This is the only true and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100705:20"/>
Kindneſs you can do them; all other Tokens of your Love, but that of good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, will die with you, or may be taken from them by ſundry Chances and Misfortunes. This is the only Treaſure and Poſſeſſion you can leave them, of which they cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd by Thieves and Robbers; out of the Power of Chance, and above the Reach and Malice of the ſubtileſt and moſt formidable Enemy. This alone, without any other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, often proves the Foundation of a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Happineſs; but every thing beſides, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, ſignifie at leaſt nothing, but are moſt commonly the Inſtruments of greater Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and the Occaſions of greater falling. And though it can't be done without reluctancy and ſome uneaſineſs on both Parts, yet it muſt needs be done however: It is but like removing Knives and Inſtruments of Danger out of their Way, for fear of hurting them, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their cryings and impatience after them; or like the adminiſtring ſevere Phyſick, to prevent a growing Sickneſs, notwithſtanding all their loathings and reſiſtance: Your Fondneſs ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hinders you from this, and yet ſevere and early Diſcipline, is but an equal croſſing of their Wills, an exerciſing of their Patience, and applying as uneaſie Remedies to Evils much
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100705:20"/>
more dangerous, and to effect a Good much more conſiderable than that of Health it ſelf. It is not eaſie to determine how far Childrens Faults are chargeable upon their Parents; there are too many, and too intricate Circumſtances to be conſider'd, before one can deciſively pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce on ſuch Matters: But neither of them are the ſafer for this Uncertainty and Doubt: The Children ſhall unqueſtionably ſuffer for their own Sins, and the Parents as unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for their Neglect: They have both of them Guilt enough, and both of them ſhall have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of Puniſhment; the one for not having done what they ſhou'd, the other for doing what they ſhou'd not. Not that after all the Care, and Diſcipline, and early Chaſtiſement, the Parent is ſecure of the Event, but ſecure of himſelf, and his Deſign: He has done his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and muſt leave the iſſue in the hands of of God; he has taken the natural, ready, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and uſual, and appointed Means, and if the Strength of Temptations, and the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Children's Paſſions, or the Perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Wills, obſtruct and hinder theſe Means from attaining of their good End, he has freed his Soul; the Parent may be, after that ſad and unfortunate, but has remov'd his Guilt and Puniſhment; and, <hi>next to the effecting what</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100705:21"/>
               <hi>we would, is the ſatisfaction of having done what one ſhould.</hi> And ſo much for Application to the Parent.</p>
            <p>A word or two to the other Party, and I have done; and that, not to perſuade you that Reproof, Reſtraint, and Puniſhment are things eligible, or no ſuch grievous and uneaſie States as they are fanſied, for they are undoubtedly uneaſie States, and juſt as bad as you experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence them to be; there is no arguing againſt ſenſe, or perſuading againſt feeling: but that you would believe, ſince they proceed from Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the greateſt Love and Tenderneſs, and ſore againſt their Inclinations, that they are the moſt natural and neceſſary Means of effecting the greateſt Good, and preventing the greateſt Evils in the World, and ſo deſigned by thoſe that do inflict them. It is true what St. <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves in another caſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. I1. that <hi>no chaſtiſement for the preſent ſeemeth to be joyous, but grievous; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs afterwards, it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of Righteouſneſs unto them which are exerciſed thereby.</hi> You cannot love Correption and Reſtraint, but when you ſhall hereaſter ſee and feel the Effects of all this careful Diſcipline, in the Fear of God, in the Government of your Paſſions, in Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, in Chaſtity, in Patience under evils, in bearing Diſappointments, in the Joys of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100705:21"/>
and the Comforts of a good Conſcience; then you will bleſs your Parents and Inſtructors, who by their Admonitions, ſeaſonable Reproofs, and early Chaſtiſements, delivered you from the Snares of Sin and Death, from the Plague of a guilty Mind, from an uneaſie Remembrance of what is paſt, and a fearful looking for of Evils to come, which you will then deſire to have avoided, though with the utmoſt Pain and Torment, and curſe the Indulgence that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it. You will have other Notions and Opinions of the Love of Parents and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors than you now have; and therefore, in the mean time, let the Reaſon, Wiſdom, and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of all Ages convince you, that the Courſes taken, to make you good and happy, are not only fit and ſuited to your Age, and Tempers, but neceſſary and unavoidable, tho' for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they appear ſo grievous and unacceptable; and therefore ben't ſo haſty and impatient under them, nor covet ſo to be deliver'd from them: be not ſo fond of immature Manhood, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you think it is a State of Freedom from the Bondage of your Diſcipline. That Age has no ſuch Charms in it as you imagine, and when aſpir'd to ſo ambitiouſly, and ſo unſeaſonably, 'tis only to perfect your Deſtruction, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete your Miſery the ſooner; it is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100705:22"/>
to the good or ill Improvement of this your Seaſon of Diſcipline, that Manhood ſhall prove more or leſs comfortable: the Ground is now a cultivating, the Seed is now a ſowing, that ſhall ſpring up to laſting Honour and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or to your laſting Shame and Ruine. And therefore though the Heats of Fancy, the Vigour of your ſpringing Youth, and Fervour of Complexion, may ſuggeſt both ſtrange and forward things, yet truſt them not, nor liſten to them. It is but like the Gaiety that ſprings up from the Fumes of New Wine, that warm and delight Men for a moment, but ſoon eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate, and leave the Heart in greater Damps and Melancholy. You will quickly find the Miſchiefs of forſaking Diſcipline, and all thoſe gay Expectances will vaniſh, and conclude in lamentable Diſappointments; but the trouble is, that then Repentance comes too late, the Time is irrecoverable, and the Evil is irreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diable. And therefore, to conclude, learn to be wiſe in this your hour, the Wiſdom at leaſt, of ſuffering others to be wiſe and careful for you, in things of which you have as yet no Knowledge or Experience, and yet ſo neceſſary to you, that thereupon depends the Welfare and Felicity of all your Lives.</p>
