            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CLEAVELAND'S PETITION To His HIGHNESSE the Lord POTECTOR.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>May it pleaſe your Highneſs,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>RUlers within the Circle of their Government have a claim to that which is ſaid of the Deity, <hi>They have their Center every where, and their Circumference no where.</hi> It is in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that I addreſs to your <hi>Highneſs,</hi> as knowing no place in the Nation is ſo remote, as not to ſhare in the ubiquity of your care; no Priſon ſo cloſe, as to ſhut me up from partaking of your influence. My <hi>Lord,</hi> it is my misfortune, that after ten years of retirement from being engaged in the difference of the State, having wound my ſelf up in a private receſs, and my comportment to the publique, being ſo inoffenſive, that in all this time, neither fears nor jealouſies have ſcrupled at our Actions: Being about three Moneths ſince at <hi>Norwich,</hi> I was fetched with a Guard before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, and ſent Priſoner to <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and if it be not a new offence to make inquiry wherein I offended (for hitherto my faults are kept as cloſe as my perſon,) I am induced to believe, that next to the adherence to the Royal party, the cauſe of my confinement is the narrowneſs of my eſtate; <hi>for none ſtand committed whoſe eſtate can bail them;</hi> I only am the Priſoner, who have no Acres to be my hoſtage. Now if my poverty be Criminal (with Reverence be it ſpoken,) I muſt implead your <hi>Highneſs,</hi> whoſe victorious Arms have reduc'd me to it, as acceſſary to my guilt. Let it ſuffice my Lord, that the calamity of the War hath made us poor; do not puniſh us for it! <hi>Who ever did Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for being raviſhed?</hi> Is it not enough that we are ſtript ſo bare, but it muſt be made in order to a ſeverer Laſh? muſt our skars be engraven with new wounds? muſt we firſt be made Cripples, then beaten with our own Crutches? Poverty! if it be a fault, it is its own puniſhment; Who ſuffers for it more, pays Uſe upon uſe. I beſeech your <hi>Highneſs</hi> put ſome bounds to our overthrow, and do not purſue the chaſe to the other World; Can your thunder be levelled ſo low as our groveling Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Can that towering Spirit that hath quarried upon Kingdoms make a ſtoop at us, who are the rubbiſh of thoſe ruines? Methinks! I hear your former Atchievments interceding with you not to ſully your glories, with trampling on the proſtrate, nor Clog the wheels of your Chariot with ſo degenerous a Triumph. The moſt renowned <hi>Heroes</hi> have ever with ſuch tenderneſs cheriſhed their <hi>Captives,</hi> That their Swords did but cut out work for their courteſie; Thoſe that fell by their proweſs, ſprung up by their favours, as if they had ſtruck them down, onely to make them rebound the Higher. I hope your <hi>Highneſs</hi> as you are the Rival of their fame, will be no leſs of their vertues; the nobleſt Trophy that you can erect to your Honour is to raiſe the afflicted. And ſince you have ſubdued all oppoſition, it now remaines that you attach your ſelf, and with acts of Mildneſs vaniquſh your victory. It is not long ſince, <hi>my Lord,</hi> that you knocked off the Shackles from moſt of our party, and by a grand releaſe did ſpread your clemency as large as your territories. Let not now proſcriptions interrupt our Jubilé. Let not that your lenity be ſlandered as the Ambuſh of your further rigour. For the ſervice of his <hi>Majeſty</hi> (if it be objected) I am ſo far from excuſing it, that I am ready to alledge it in my vindication: I cannot conceive that my fidelity to my Prince ſhould taint me in your opinion; I ſhould rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it ſhould recommend me to your favour; Had not we been faithfull to our <hi>King,</hi> we could not have given our ſelves to be ſo to your <hi>Highneſs;</hi> you had then truſted us <hi>gratis,</hi> whereas now we have our former Loyalty to vouch us. You ſee my <hi>Lord,</hi> how much I preſume upon the greatneſs of your Spirit, that dare prevent my Indictment with ſo frank a Confeſſion, eſpecially in this, which I may ſo juſtly deny, that it is almoſt arrogancy in me to own it; for the truth is, I was not qualifi'd enough to ſerve him; all that I could doe, was to bear a part in his ſufferings, and give my ſelf up to be cruſhed with his fall; thus my charge is doubled (my obedience to my Soveraign, and what is the reſult of that, my want of-fortune;) Now what ever reflections I have on the former, I am a true penitent for the latter; My <hi>Lord</hi> you ſee my crimes! As to my defence you bear it about you! I ſhall plead nothing in my juſtification, by your <hi>Highneſs,</hi> (which as it is the conſtant inmate of a valiant breaſt, If you graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleaſe to extend it to your Suppliant in taking me out of this withering durance,) your <hi>Highneſs</hi> will find that mercy will eſtabliſh you more than power; though all the days of your life were as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant with victories, as your twice auſpicious third of <hi>September.</hi>
