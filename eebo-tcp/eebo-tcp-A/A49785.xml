            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The Observations for the discovery of Witches.</head>
               <p>NOw for asmuch as Witches are the most cruell, revengefull, and
bloody of all others: The Justices of Peace may not alwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
direct evidence, seeing all their works are workes of darkenesse,
and no witnesses present with them to accuse them; and therefore for
their better discovery I thought good here to insert certaine observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
partly out of the book of discovery of the Witches that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned
at <hi>Lancaster, Anno dom.</hi> 1612. before Sir <hi>Iames Altham,</hi> and
Sir <hi>Edward Bromeley</hi> Judges of Assise there: And partly out of Mr.
<hi>Bernards Guide to grand Iury-men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. These Witches have ordinarily a familiar, or spirit, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to them; sometimes in one shape, sometimes in another, as in the
shape of a Man, Woman, Boy, Dogge, Cat, Fo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le, Fowle, Hare, Rat,
Toad, &amp;c. And to these their spirits they give names, and they meet
together to Christen them. <hi>Ber.</hi> 107. 113.</p>
               <p>2. Their said Familiar hath some big or little teat upon their body,
where he sucketh them; and besides their sucking, the Devil leaveth
other markes upon their bodies, sometimes like a Blew-spot, or Red-spot,
like a flea-biting, sometimes the flesh sunck in and hollow, all
which for a time may be covered, yea taken away, but will come again
to their old forme: and these the Devils markes be insensible, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pricked wil not bleed; and be often in their secret parts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
require diligent and carefull search. <hi>Ber.</hi> 112. 219.</p>
               <p>These first two are maine points to discover and convict these Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
for they prove fully that those Witches have a Familiar; and made
a League with the Devil. <hi>Ber.</hi> 60.</p>
               <p>So likewise if the suspected be proved to have been heard to call upon
their Spirit, or to talk to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or of them, or have offered them to others.</p>
               <p>So if they have been seen with their Spirits, or seen to feed some
thing secretly, these are proofes they have a familiar, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. They have often pictures of clay or wax (like a man, &amp;c. made of
such as they would bewitch) found in their house, or which they roast,
or bury in the earth, that as the picture consumes, so may the parties
bewitched consume.</p>
               <p>4. There are other presumptions against these Witches; as if they be
given to usuall cursing, and bitter imprecations, and withall use threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
to be revenged, and their imprecations, or some other mischief
presently followeth, <hi>Ber.</hi> 61. 205.</p>
               <p>5. Their implicite confession, as when any shall accuse them for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:39554:3"/>
hurting them or their cattell, they shall answer, You should have let
me alone then, or, I have not hurt you as yet: These and the like spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are in manner of a confession of their power of hurting, <hi>Ber.</hi> 206.</p>
               <p>6. Their diligent inquiry after the sick party; or coming to visite him
or her unsent for; but especially being forbiden the house.</p>
               <p>7. Their apparition to the sick party in his fits.</p>
               <p>8. The sick party in his fits naming the parties suspected, and where
they be or have been, or what they do, if truly.</p>
               <p>9. The Common report of their neighbours, especially if the party
suspected be of kin, or servant to, or familiar with a convicted Witch:</p>
               <p>10. The testimony of other Witches, confessing their own Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts,
and witnessing against the suspected, and that they have Spirits,
or Markes; that they have been at their meetings: that they have told
them what harme they have done, &amp;c. <hi>Ber.</hi> 212. 223.</p>
               <p>11. If the dead body bleed upon the <hi>Witches</hi> touching it.</p>
               <p>12. The testimony of the person hurt, upon his death.</p>
               <p>13. The examination and confession of the Children (able and fit
to answer) or servants of the Witch; especially concerning the first
six observations of the party suspected; Her threatnings and cursings
of the sick party; her enquiring after the sick party; her boasting or
rejoycing at the sick parties trouble: Also whether they have seen her
call upon, speak to, or feed any Spirit, or such like; or have heard her
foretell of this mishap, or speak of her power to hurt, or of her trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
to this or that place, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>14. Their own voluntary confession (which exceeds all other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences)
of the hurt they have done, or of the giving of their soules to
the Devil, and of the Spirits which they have, how many, how they
call them, and how they came by them.</p>
               <p>15. Besides, upon the apprehension of any suspected, to search also
their houses diligently for pictures of clay or wax, &amp;c. haire cut, bones,
powders, books of witchcrafts, charms; and for pots or places where
their spirits may be kept, the smell of which place will stink detestably.</p>
               <p>Now to shew you further some signes to know whether the sick
party be bewitched:</p>
               <p>1. When a healthy body shall be suddenly taken, &amp;c. without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
reason, or naturall cause appearing, &amp;c. <hi>Ber.</hi> 169.</p>
               <p>2. When two or more are taken in the like strange fits in many
things.</p>
               <p>3. When the afflicted party in his fits doth tell truly many things
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39554:4"/>
what the Witch or other persons absent are doing or saying, and the
like.</p>
               <p>4. When the parties shall do many things strangely, or speak many
things to purpose, and yet out of their fits know not any thing thereof.</p>
               <p>5. When there is a strength supernaturall, as that a strong man or
two shall not be able to keep down a child, or weak person, upon a bed.</p>
               <p>6. When the party doth vomit up pins, needles, nailes, coales, lead,
straw, haire, or the like.</p>
               <p>7. When the party shall see visibly some apparition, and shortly after
some mischief shall befall him. <hi>Ber.</hi> 173.</p>
               <p>Note, for the better riddance of these Witches, there must good
care be had, as well in their examinations taken by the Justices, as also
in the drawing of their indictments, that the same be both set down di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
in the materiall points, &amp;c. As,</p>
               <p>That the Witch (or party suspected) hath used invocation of some
Spirit.</p>
               <l>That they have consulted or covenanted with their Spirit.</l>
               <l>That they imployed their Spirit.</l>
               <l>That they fed or rewarded their Spirit.</l>
               <l>That they have killed, or lamed, &amp;c. some person, &amp;c,</l>
               <l>And not to indict them generally for being Witches &amp;c.</l>
               <p>The difference between Conjuration, Witchcraft, and Inchantment,
&amp;c. is this: <hi>viz.</hi> Conjurers and Witches have personall conference
with the Devil or evill spirit, to effect their purpose, see 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 7. &amp;c.
The Conjurers believe, that by certain terrible words they can raise the
Devil, and make him to tremble; and by impaling themselves in a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
(which as one saith cannot keep out a mouse) they beleeve that
they are therein insconsed and safe from the Devil, whom they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to raise; and having raised the Devil, they seem, by prayers, and
invocation of Gods powerfull Names, to compell the Devil to say or
do what the Conjurer commandeth him.</p>
               <p>The Witch dealeth rather by a friendly and voluntary conference or
agreement between him (or her) and the Devil or Familiar, to have his
or her turn served, and in lieu thereof the Witch giveth (or offereth)
his or her soule, blood, or other gift unto the Devil.</p>
               <p>Also the Conjurer compacteth for curiosity, to know secrets, or work
miracles; And the Witch of meere malice to do mischiefe, and to be
revenged.</p>

The Inchanter, Charmer, or Sorcerer, these have no personall confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with the Devil, but (without any apparition) work and perform
things (seemingly at the least) by certain superstitious, and ceremoniall
formes of words (called Charmes) by them pronounced, or by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
herbs, or other things applied above the course of nature; and by
the Devils help, and covenants made with him.</p>
               <p>Of this last sort likewise are Soothsayers or Wisards, which divine
and foretell things to come, by the flying, singing, or feeding of Birds:
and unto such questions as be demanded of them, they do answer by
the Devil (or by his help) <hi>sc.</hi> they do either answer by voyce, or else
do set before their eyes in glasses, chrystall stones, or rings, the pictures
or images of the persons or things sought for.</p>

         <div type="account_of_confession">
            <head>I shall now adde the Confession of Mother Lake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
of Ipswich, who was arraigned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for a Witch, and suffered death by
burning, at Ipswich in Suffolk, on Tuesday the
9. of September, 1645.</head>
            <p>THe said Mother <hi>Lakeland</hi> hath been a professour of Religion, a
constant hearer of the Word for these many years, and yet a <hi>Witch</hi>
(as she confessed) for the space of near twenty years. The <hi>Devil</hi> came
to her first between sleeping and waking, and spake to her in a hollow
voyce, telling her, that if she would serve him she should want nothing.
After often sollicitation she consented to him; then he stroke his claw
(as she confessed) into her hand, and with her blood wrote the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.
<hi>(Now the subtilty of Sathan is to be observed, in that he did not
presse her to deny God and Christ, as he useth to do to others; because she
was a Professour, and might have lost all his hold by pressing her too far)</hi>
Then he furnished her with three Imps, two little Dogs and a Mole (as
she confessed) which she imployed in her services: Her husband she
bewitched (as she confessed) whereby he lay in great misery for a time,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:39554:5"/>
and at last dyed. Then she sent one of her Dogs to one Mr. <hi>Lawrence</hi> in
<hi>Ipswich,</hi> to torment him and take away his life: she sent one of them
also to his Child, to torment it, and take away the life of it, which was
done upon them both: and all this (as she confessed) was, because he
asked her for 12. S. that she owed him, and for no other cause.</p>
            <p>She further confessed, that she sent her Mole to a Maid of one Mrs.
<hi>Ienings</hi> in <hi>Ipswich,</hi> to torment her and take away her life, which was
done accordingly: and this for no other cause, but for that the said
Maid would not lend her a needle that she desired to borrow of her, and
was earnest with her for a shilling that she owed the said Maid.</p>
            <p>Then she further confessed, she sent one of her Imps to one Mr. <hi>Beale</hi>
in <hi>Ipswich,</hi> who had formerly been a sutor to her Grand-child; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he would not have her, she sent and burned a new ship (that had
never been at Sea) that he was to go Master of; and sent also to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
him and take away his life; but he is yet living, but in very great
misery, and as it is verily conceived by the Doctors and Chirurgions
that have him in hand, that he consumes and rots, and that halfe of his
body is rotten upon him as he is living.</p>
            <p>Severall other things she did, for all which she was by Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to die, and in particular to be burned to death, because she was
the death of her husband, as she confessed; which death she suffered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>But since her death there is one thing that is very remarkable, and to
be taken notice of: That upon the very day that she was burned, a
bunch of flesh, something after the form of a Dog, that grew upon the
thigh of the said Mr. <hi>Beale,</hi> ever since the time that she first sent her Imp
to him, being very hard, but could never be made to break by all the
means that could be used; brake of it self, without any means using:
And another sore, that at the same time she first sent her Imp to him,
rose upon the side of his belly, in the form of a Fistula, which ran, and
could not be healed by all the means that could be used, presently also
began to heale, and there is great hopes that he will suddenly recover
again, for his sores heale apace, and he doth recover his strength. He
was in this misery for the space of a yeare and halfe, and was forced to
go with his head and his knees together, his misery was so great.</p>
