            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orſomuch, the truth of hiſtorie, is
the foundation of faith, and of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
vnderſtanding, (Chriſtian
Reader,) and the hiſtory of things
donne, blinde and imperfect, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the knowledge of places, the
which knowledge giueth muche
light, both to the truth of hiſtory, and alſo to the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
interpretation thereof: therefore I haue thought good
to obſerue two things with great diligence in this worke.
Firſt that I might portray and ſet forth the true and liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Image of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> of all other citties the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
and famous throughout the whole world, whereof men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is made in ſacred and in prophane hiſtories, as it flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
in Chriſt his time; and alſo the forme of the temple,
(the fame whereof hath beene extolled aboue the heauens,
and was worthy of eternall memory) by the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
by approued writers, and by auncient tradition of
faithfull and truſty men, in a liuely plot, or map, moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitly
drawn, together with the names, originalls, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
and formes of euery place, and the moſt worthy hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories
concerning the ſame, with all breuity. Secondly,
that I might rightly diſpoſe the places of Chriſt his pasſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and repreſent euery thing which he ſuffered in euery
place, euen as if they were now donne before our eies: and
ſo repreſented that I might, explaine it with plaineneſſe
and breuity. For hereby, all thoſe thinges which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
for our ſakes, wilbe both more plainely vnderſtood,
and alſo more profitably remembred. But per aduenture
there wilbe ſome which will miſlike this our endeuour,
and the rather bicauſe we haue many thinges by tradition
of elders: to whom I anſwere out of Saint <hi>Hierom</hi> where
<pb facs="tcp:542:5"/>
he ſaith, <hi>That eccleſiaſticall traditions, which are no
hinderance to faith, are ſo to be kept, as they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
by the auncients.</hi> In the meane time I will not
ſay, that they are too raſh &amp; too too wicked, which wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that thing,<note place="margin">Hier. to. 1.</note> which hath beene godly receiued at al times
and of all men.<note place="margin">Epiſt. 28. ad Lucinium.</note> So many of vs therefore as waſhed with
the bloud of Chriſt, do beare his name and are called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
if our faith be aunſwering to our name, and our life
not diſagreeing from the truth, hoping to be ſaued by the
merits &amp; grace of Chriſt our ſauiour, let vs beleeue that,
which incorrupt and reuerend antiquity hath left, let vs
in no wiſe depart from thoſe thinges which our aunceſtors
haue celebrated without ſuperſtition, and which by the
conſent of the whole worlde, are come euen from them to
our hands, and with thankful godlines, and godly thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
let vs call to minde thoſe places oftentimes, which
may put vs in rememberance of the pasſion of Chriſte: to
which places this mappe will leade vs, as it were by the
hande: and with the eies of faith and of our minde let vs
looke vpon the ſame ſonne of God, and inwardly behoulde
him, who being vrged with the great loue of our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hauing finiſhed his laſte ſupper in the parlour of Sion
and being come into the Garden of Oliuet, prayed and
ſwet bloud, through the anguiſh and greuous conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Imminent afflictions. Immediately hee was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
by the moſt wicked Iudas; he was taken, bounde,
and thruſt forward by the Iewes, euen as a lambe by the
woolues, moſt cruelly amidſt the noiſe of clamors and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
and then was ledde to the houſe of <hi>Anna</hi> the high
prieſt: There hee was ſtricken: From thence hee was
drawne to the pallace of <hi>Caiphas:</hi> in the ſame, hee was
falſely accuſed, condemned, ſpyt vpon, blindfolded, buffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with fiſtes, and ſundry waies all the night ſcorned and
afflicted. In the morning he was violently caried through
the midſt of the cittie to the houſe of <hi>Pilate.</hi> From thence
<pb facs="tcp:542:5"/>
he was led to the pallace of <hi>Herod</hi> and accufed againe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed
of him, mocked, &amp; apparrelled like a foole in a white
garment, &amp; brought back again by another way of the city
to <hi>Pilate.</hi> There again he was accuſed of many faultes, ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ped,
and greuouſly whipped, cloathed with purple, crowned
with thornes, dyuerſly derided, ſpitted vppon, buffetted
with fiſtes and ſtricken with a reede<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and being thus miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed,
was made a gazeing ſtocke to the people and adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to death. Then he was loden with a heauie croſſe, and
in the ſight of all the people, with greeuous and bloudy ſteps
hee was drawen, punched: and vrged by the furiouſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
of the ſoldiers, through a great parte of the cittie,
and by the gate of Iudgement out of the cittie, by a harde
and ſtoany way, euen vnto mount, <hi>Caluarie.</hi> And being
come thither he was ſtripped againe, and being both faint
and weary, was refreſhed with gaule in ſtede of drink: and
about high noone he was faſtened to the croſse, &amp; ſo lifted
vpon high. And hanging on the croſſe by the ſpace of three
howers, was derided with taunts &amp; reproachfull woordes:
being thirſtie, they gaue him vineger to drinke. Finally
he which could ſaue the world with one drop of his bloude
would needes beſtowe vppon vs by the fiue Riuers of his
woundes, his life, with all his bloude. A figure hereof
was that braſen ſerpent,<note place="margin">Cant. 3.</note> which moſes cauſed to be exalted
in the wildernes. To this ſpectacle alſo our heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Phiſicke, the full knowledge of Lawe and of Iuſtice, the
ſcience of liberall artes, of true humilitie, of obedience, of
pietie, of charitie, of patience, finally of all manner of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
and of thinges moſt perfect: and may alſo bee inflamed
and drawen to loue and to follow Chriſt. Thus the bleſſed
virgin, ſtanding nere to the croſſe of Chriſt, did not onely
with bodely eies, but alſo in hart, through faith (which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
not in her) behould the woundes of her ſonne and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
thinking thereon, was ſo comforted, that now, as
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith ſhe was prepared alſo to die for the good
of mankind.<note place="margin">Ambroſe in Luc. ca. 23.</note> So ſaint Ihon both ſeing the ſide of Christ o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
with a ſpeare,<note place="margin">Iohn. 19.</note> bloude with water comming foorth of
the ſame, and alſo giuing teſtimonie thereunto, did by the
meditation thereof ſo greatly profite, that at the laſt he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a moſt perfect diuine, and a ſoaring Eagle to behoulde
the moſt holy Trinitie.<note place="margin">Luk. 23, Hier. to. 1.</note> So the Theefe, when he ſawe and
hearde Chriſt Ieſus crucified,<note place="margin">Epiſt. 13. ad Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> in continently tourned vnto
Chriſt, and confesſing him, he made the puniſhment of mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
martiredome, and chaunged the croſſe for Paradice.
So alſo the <hi>Centurion</hi> by this ſpectacle,<note place="margin">Mar. 15.</note> receaued ſo great
ſtrength of faith, that vnder the croſse he was made a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb facs="tcp:542:6"/>
confeſſor of Chriſt, and further (as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>
ſaith) was afterwarde crowned with <hi>Martyredome.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chriſoſt. in Mat. ca. 27.</note>
Moreouer <hi>Thomas</hi> behoulding &amp; touching the wounds
of Chriſt crucified, was ſo illumined with faith, that hee
plainly and openly profeſsed Chriſt, to be both his Lord and
his God.</p>
            <p>This beeing ſo, and loue procuring loue, euen as the
loadſtone draweth Ironne: who is hee, I pray you, whome
ſo vehement loue of Chriſt, nay rather a heate and flame
will not affecte, kindell, and ſette on fier? Who is he when
at the death of Chriſt all creatures do ſuffer with him, the
Sunne darkened, the vaile of the Temple rent in ſonder,
the earth quaking, Rockes breaking, graues opening, and
the deade ariſing, who and what is hee (I ſay) that will
not woonder, and that will not be abasſhed? Onely Adams
children, for whoſe cauſe he died are not moued with this
ſo great a benefite.</p>
            <p>The Adamente, that moſt harde ſtoane, is mollified
with the bloude of a goate: Iron with the heate of fier is
made ſofte:<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 10.</note> but the hartes of Chriſtians more harde then
Adamant or Iron, are not mollified with the bloude and
fier of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but do crucifie a freſh vnto themſelues the
ſonne of God, and do tread vnder their feete the bloude of
the teſtament.</p>
            <p>What I pray you can be more beſeeming, more meete,
more Iuſte, and more profitable for vs, then to loue againe
him that ſo loueth vs, and Imitate him whome wee loue?
For if any thing herein ſeme harde, if any thing greuous,
that thing, loue, the ſweete yoke of the Lord, maketh light
and eaſie, for all labor is light, to him that loueth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that notable ſentence of that auntiente father
ſaint <hi>Gregory, Nihil adeo graue eſt quod non aequani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miter
toleretur, ſi Chrſti pasſio, ad memoriam reduca
tur.</hi> There is nothing ſo heauy &amp; burthenſome but the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:542:7"/>
is willingly borne, if ſo be the pasſion of Chriſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered.</p>
            <p>For we will indure all thinges with patience as light
and eaſie, if we call to mynde what hard wordes, harder
ſtripes, and moſt harde paines and afflictions, he ſuffered
for vs, whoſe heade was crowned with thornes, his eyes
blinde foulded, his eares filled with reproaches, his mouth
with gaule and vineger, his face polluted with ſpitting,
his cheekes bruſed with buffetting, his kneeſe ſhaking, his
ſhoulders laden with the croſſe, his hart repleniſhed with
ſorrow his bodie torne with whippes, his members racked,
his handes and feete bored,<note place="margin">Exod. 15.</note> to be breefe from the crowne of
the heade to the ſoales of the foot, he ſuſtained an Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſort of woundes and ſorrowes. Wherefore as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<hi>Mara,</hi> being ſometimes bitter, were made ſwete by
<hi>Moſes,</hi> at what time he caſt wood into them: euen ſo all
our tribulation, if we patiently indure the croſſe of Chriſt,
will waxe ſweete, and the gaule thereof will: tourne into
honny. For by the meditations of theſe afflictions of our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
faith is illumined, hope ſtrengthened, charitie infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and all vertue increaſed. Wherefore ſaint Auguſtine
a light of the Church, no leſſe truly then godly, prouoking
vs by very forceable woordes therevnto: ſaith thus, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould
the woundes of him that hangeth, the bloud of
him that dieth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Auguſt. in lib de virgi nitate.</note>

that it is not enough to meditate of theſe thinges once: but
it is profitable to thinke vpon them often: yea the oftener,
the more they auaile and profite. In the wholeſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
<pb facs="tcp:542:7"/>
of whoſe pasſion, although we profite much, yet
we ſhall neuer attaine to the perfite knowledge thereof,
but there will remaine ſtill ſomewhat that we may ſeeke
for, the full knowledge wherof is reſerued to our heauenly
countrey. In the meane tyme, let vs contemplate in theſe
thinges day and night, in theſe things let vs recreate and

yea to die in the meditation of theſe things, is moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,

ſhut vppe the Iewes in the Cittie as in a priſon, which
came out of euerie Tribe to cellebrate the feaſt of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer

famine, peſtilence, and ſword, there periſhed in the

ſeeking to put out, could not by any manner of means

polliſhed ſtones, couered with a leaden roofe, very
large high and bewtifull to behold. The which in

ſcorned him, ſhaking their heads, and ſaying, <hi>Thou

ouercame Sathan, brake a ſunder hell gates, reſtored

THeſe (<hi>Chriſtian Reader</hi>) are the moſt notable and
famous places of the Citty and Temple of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.
By the placing whereof, the ſcituation of the reſt
may eaſily be knowne. Therefore if wee haue made a
true deſcription, let the praiſe be giuen to God, the
giuer of all good gifts. But if otherwiſe there bee any
defect, impute that to my want of skill, and not to my
ill will: who for that I was not able to giue towards the
furniſhing of the Temple, golde, ſiluer, or pretious
ſtones, haue notwithſtanding offered a little oyle to
lighten the Church; truſting that the ſame will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
both to Chriſt,who allowed the twoe
mites which the poore Widdow offered: &amp;
alſo to thoſe that be good Chriſtians,
whom it becommeth well to
be like vnto their hed
CHRIST.</p>
