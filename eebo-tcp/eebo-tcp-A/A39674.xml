         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Reverend Author of
the ensuing Treatises, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in them explained and
defended several Gospel-Truths,
unto which divers
things in the Writings of the Reverend
Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi> deceased, do seem very opposite;
Whereas some of us who subscribed a Paper,
the design whereof was only to testify, That
we believed certain Writings of the Doctor's
<hi>never before Published,</hi> were faithfully
transcribed by his Son, the Publisher of
them; which Paper is now, by the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller,
prefixed to the whole Volume, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a large Preface, which we never
saw till after the publication, together with
all the Doctor's former Works that were
<hi>published many years before;</hi> And are
hereupon, by some weak People, misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
as if by that Certificate, we intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an Approbation of all that is contained
in that Volume. We declare, we had no such
intention: As the Paper we subscribed hath
no word in it that gives any such intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
But are well pleased these later Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb facs="tcp:54465:3"/>
are Publish'd (in reference whereto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
We only certified our belief, which we fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
retain, of the Publisher's fidelity)
as they contain many passages in them, that
may in some measure remedy the hard and
hurtful construction that many expressions
were more liable to <hi>in the former;</hi> whereof
the Doctor seem'd apprehensive himself, when
in the beginning of his Discourse, on <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.
11, 12. he speaks thus: <hi>[Beloved, I am
jealous of you with an holy jealousy,
1</hi> Cor. 11. 2, 3. <hi>Lest after the sweet
wooing of you in Christ's Name, that
you might be espoused unto him; I
say, I am jealous, and fear, lest as the
Serpent beguiled</hi> Eve <hi>through his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty,
namely, bewitching her to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous,
licentious adventuring on
God's gentleness, while she tasted the
forbidden Fruit; so your minds should
be corrupted from the simplicity that is
in him, namely, by presuming too much
upon him, and adventuring to continue
in Sin, in hope that Grace may abound.
For the preventing of which dangerous
miscarriage, which hath been the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
lot of many Thousands, I
thought good to step in with this Text,
which I am persuaded will prove a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable

'Tis best, if any unwary Reader receive
hurt, that he receive his healing also from
the same hand; and whereas a Paper was
Printed upon this occasion soon after the
Publication of the Doctor's Works, We
willingly adopt so much of it as is requisite
to our present purpose, which is to this effect:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Some who Subscribed, this Certificate,
saw only the Paper it self, to which sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
was desired; never having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used
the Works of Dr. <hi>Crisp.</hi> The Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate
only concerned the Son, not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and certified only concerning the Son,
That they who should subscribe it, believed
him in this, to deal truly; that he was not
a <hi>Falsarius;</hi> that he would not say that was
his Father's, which was not so; a Paper
so sober, so modest, was (<hi>taken by it
self</hi>) scarce refusable by a Friend.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Son's Preface, some that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
this Certificate, saw not, nor had
any notice, or the least imagination of its
Contents; otherwise the part of a Friend
had certainly been done, as well in advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
against much of the Preface as in
subseribing the Certificate.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54465:4"/>
               <q>For the Works of this Reverend Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
themselves, as it no way concern'd
the subscribing this Certificate, to know
what they were; so from the opinion that
went of the Author, among many good
Men, That he was a Learned, Pious,
Good Man, it was supposed they were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to have in them many good and useful
things; to which it was only needful to
think them <hi>his,</hi> not <hi>to think them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We may in some respect judge of Books
as of Men, <hi>i. e.</hi> reckon, that though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
very valuable Men, have had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
failings; yet that upon the
whole, 'tis better they have lived and
been known in the World, than that they
should not have lived, or have lived ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The truth is (which we have often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered)
that though the great Doctrines
of Christian Religion do make a most co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent,
comely Scheme, which every one
should labour to comprehend and digest
in his mind; yet when the Gospel first
becomes effectual for the changing mens
hearts, 'tis by God's blessing this or that
passage which drops; the most discern not
the series and connection of Truths at first,
and too little afterwards.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54465:4"/>
               <q>Vpon that view of Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Writings
we have had since the Publication, we find
there are many things said in them, with
that good savour, quickness, and spirit,
as to be very apt to make good impressions
upon mens hearts; and do judge, that
being greatly affected with the Grace of
God to Sinners himself, his Sermons did
thereupon run much in that strain. All
our minds are little, and incomprehensive;
we cannot receive the weight and impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of all necessary things at once, but
with some inequality; so that when the
Seal goes deeper in some part, 'tis the
shallower in some others.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If some parts of Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Works be
more liable to exception, the danger of hurt
thereby seems in some measure obviated
<hi>in some other:</hi> As when he says, <hi>p. 46
vol. 1. Sanctification of Life, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
Companion with the Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of a Person by the Free-Grace of
Christ.</hi> And Vol. 4. p. 93. <hi>That in
respect of the Rules of Righteousness,
or the Matter of Obedience, we are
under the Law still, or else we are
Lawless, to live every Man as seems
good in his own eyes, which I know
no true Christian does so much as
think.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:54465:5"/>
               <q>In like manner whereas, <hi>Vol. 2.
Serm. 15. and perhaps elsewhere, the
Doctor seems to be against evidencing
our Justification and Union to Christ,
by our Sanctification and new Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
we have the truth of God in this
matter plainly deliver'd by him.</hi> Vol. 4.
p. 36. <hi>when he teacheth, that our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is a comfortable evidence of our
being in Christ; and on that, as well as
on many accounts, necessary.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The difference between him and other
good men, seems to lie not so much <hi>in the
things,</hi> which the one or other of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
as about <hi>their order</hi> and <hi>reference
to one another;</hi> where, 'tis true, there
may be very <hi>material difference:</hi> but we
reckon, That notwithstanding what is more
controversible in these Writings, there
are much more <hi>material things,</hi> wherein
they cannot but agree, and would have come
much nearer each other, even in these
things, if they did take some words
or terms which come into use on the one
or the other hand, <hi>in the same sense;</hi>
but when one uses a word in <hi>one sense,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
uses the same word (or understands it,
being used) in quite <hi>another sense,</hi> here
seems a vast disagreement, which proves
at length to be verbal only, and really none
<pb facs="tcp:54465:5"/>
at all: As let by <hi>Condition,</hi> be meant a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
Cause,</hi> (in which case 'tis well
known <hi>Civillians</hi> are not wont to take it)
and the one side would never use it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
any good Act that can be done by
us, or good Habit that is wrought in us, in
order to our present acceptance with God,
or final Salvation. Let be meant by it,
somewhat, that by the constitution of the
Gospel-Covenant, and in the nature of
the thing is <hi>requisite</hi> to our present and
eternal well-being, without the least notion
of desert, but utmost abhorrence of any
such notion in this case, and the other
side would as little refuse it. But what
need is there for contending at all about
a <hi>Law-term,</hi> about the proper or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
use whereof, there is so little agreement
between <hi>them it seems best to serve,</hi> and
<hi>them it offends.</hi> Let it go, and they will
well enough understand one another. Again,
Let <hi>Justification</hi> be taken for that which is
compleat, entire, and full, as it results at
last from all its Causes, and Concurrents,
and on the one hand it would never be denied
Christ's righteousness justifies us at the Bar
of God in the Day of Iudgment, <hi>as the
only deserving cause;</hi> or affirmed that our

us there, <hi>as any cause at all.</hi> Let Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
<pb facs="tcp:54465:6"/>
be meant only of being justified in
<hi>this or that particular respect;</hi> As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
against <hi>this particular Accusation,</hi>
of never having been a Believer: and the
honest mistaken <hi>Prefacer</hi> would never have
said, O horrid! upon its being said, Christ's
Righteousness doth not justify us in this case:
For he very well knows Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
will justifie no man that <hi>never was a
Believer;</hi> but that which must immediately
justifie him <hi>against this particular Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,</hi>
must be proving, that he did sincerely
believe, which shews his interest in Christ's
Righteousness, which then is the only deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
cause of his full entire Iustification.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>There is an Expression in <hi>Vol. 1. p. 46.
That Salvation is not the end of any good
work we do,</hi> which is like that of another;
<hi>we are to act from Life, not for Life.</hi>
Neither of which are to be <hi>rigidly taken,</hi>
as 'tis likely they were never <hi>meant</hi> in the
strict sense. For the former, this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Author gives us himself the handle,
for a gentle interpretation, in what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
subjoyns, where he makes <hi>the end of
our good works to be the manifestation
of our Obedience and Subjection; the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth the praise of the glory of the
Grace of God;</hi> which seems to imply, that
he meant the foregoing negation in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative,
<pb facs="tcp:54465:6"/>
not in an absolute sense; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
the glory of God to be <hi>more
principal;</hi> and so that by <hi>end,</hi> he meant
the very <hi>ultimate end:</hi> so for the other 'tis
likely it was meant, that we should not act
or work <hi>for</hi> life <hi>only,</hi> without aiming and
endeavouring, that we might come to work
<hi>from</hi> life <hi>also.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>For it is not with any tolerable charity
supposable, that one would <hi>deliberately
say</hi> the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other</hi> of these in the
rigid sense of the words; or that he would
not, upon consideration, presently unsay it,
being calmly reasoned with. For it were
in effect to <hi>abandon Humane Nature,</hi>
and to sin against a very Fundamental Law
of our Creation, not to intend our own feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;
it were to make our first and most deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Fundamental Duty, in one great essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial

Lord for our God:</hi> For <hi>to take him for
our God</hi> most. <hi>essentially</hi> includes our
taking him for our <hi>supream good;</hi> which
we all know, is included in the notion of the
<hi>last end;</hi> it were to make it unlawful to
strive against all sin, and particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sinful oversion from God; wherein
lies the very death of the Soul, or the sum
of its misery; or to strive after perfect
conformity to God in holiness, and the full

as the Character and commendation
of the most eminent Saints; a fault, as of
<hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> &amp;c. That
<hi>they sought the better and Heavenly
Countrey; and declared plainly</hi> that
they did so: which necessarily implies their
making it their end.</q>

            <p>
               <q>But let none be so harsh as to think of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good man, that he intended any thing of
all this; if every passage that falls from
us be stretch'd and tortured with utmost
severity, we shall find little to do besides
accusing others, and defending our selves
as long as we live.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A Spirit of meekness and love, will do
more to our Common Peace, than all the
Disputations in the World.</p>
            <p>Vpon the whole, We are so well assured of
the peaceful healing temper of the present
Author of these Treatises, That we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
he designed such a course of mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the Controversies wherein he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
himself, as not on the one hand to

Nor do we say thus much of him, as if
he sought, or did need any Letters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
from us; but as counting this
Testimony to Truth, and this expression of
respect to him, a Debt; to the spontaneous
payment whereof, nothing more was requisite
besides such a fair occasion as the Providence
of God hath now laid before us, inviting us
thereunto.</p>

such an improper time as this.
I should never spontaneously have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened

God's severe castigation of his people for
them, and in the most proper and hopeful
season for their Redintegration.</p>
            <p>And beside what I have formerly said,
I think fit here to add, That if the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque

            </p>
            <p>The Book now in thy hands consisteth
of Four parts, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. A general Discourse
of <hi>the Causes and Cures of Errors,</hi> very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
at all times (especially at this time)
for the reduction and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
and staggering Christians; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that nature having occurred to
my observation among the manifold Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemical
Tracts that are extant, I thought it
might be of some use to the Churches of
Christ in such a vertigenous Age as we
live in; and the blessing of the Lord go
<pb facs="tcp:54465:9"/>
forth with it for benefit and establishment.</p>
            <p>2. Next, thou hast here the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
moved by my Antagonist, <hi>first</hi> about
the <hi>Mosaick Law</hi> complexly taken, which
he boldly pronounces to be an <hi>Adam</hi>'s Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of works. And <hi>secondly,</hi> about <hi>God's
Covenant with Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. which he
also makes the same with that God made
with <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradise;</hi> and affirms Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
(expresly called a Seal of the
Righteousness of Faith) to be the Seal of
the said Covenant of Works first made
with <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Finding my Adversary in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of his design, running into many <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian
delirations,</hi> to the reproach and
damage of the Cause he contends for; I
thought it necessary to take the principal
Errors of <hi>Antinomianism</hi> into examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
especially at such a time as this, when
they seem to spring afresh, to the hazard
of God's Truth, and the Churches Peace;
wherein I have dealt with becoming-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
and plainness, if haply I might be
any way instrumental in my plain and
home way of Argumentation, to detect
the falsity and dangerous nature of those
notions which some good men have vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb facs="tcp:54465:10"/>
and preserve the sounder part of the
Church from so dangerous a contagion.</p>
            <p>4. In the next place I think it necessary
to advertise the Reader, That whereas in
my first <hi>Appendix</hi> under that head of the
<hi>Conditionality</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> I
have asserted Faith to be the Condition of
it, and do acknowledg, <hi>p.</hi> 246. that the
word <hi>Condition</hi> is variously used among
<hi>Iurists;</hi> yet I do not use in any sense,
which implies or insinuates, that there is
any such condition in the New Covenant,
as that in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant was, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in perfect, personal, and perpetual obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
or any thing in its own nature
meritorious of the benefits promised, or
capable to be performed by us in our own
strength; but plainly, that it be an act of
ours (tho' done in God's strength) which
must be necessarily done before we can be
actually justified or saved; and so there is
found in it the true suspending nature of
a condition; which is the thing I contend
for, when I affirm, Faith is the condition
of the New Covenant.</p>
            <p>How many senses soever may be given
of this word <hi>Condition,</hi> this is the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
sense in which I use it throughout
this Controversy. And whosoever denies
the suspending Nature of Faith, with
<pb facs="tcp:54465:10"/>
respect to actual Justification, pleads
(according to my understanding) for the
actual Justification of Infidels. And,
thus I find a Condition defined by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var.
Iohan. Baptist. Petrus de Perus.</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Conditio est Suspensio alicujus dispositionis
tantisper dum aliquid futurum fiat.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>Conditio est quidam futurus eventus,
in quem dispositio suspenditur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once more, My Reader possibly may
be stumbled at my calling Faith some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the <hi>Instrument,</hi> and sometimes the
<hi>Condition</hi> of our Justification, when
there is so great a Controversy depending
among Learned Men, with respect to
the use of both those terms. I therefore
desire the Reader to take notice, That I
<hi>dive</hi> not into that Controversy here,
much less presume to <hi>determine</hi> it; but
finding both those Notions equally op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by our <hi>Antinomians,</hi> who reject
our actual Justification by Faith either
way, and allow to Faith no other use in
our actual Justification, but only to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
to us what was done from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
I do therefore use both those terms,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Conditionality,</hi> and <hi>Instrumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
of Faith, with respect unto our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
and shew in what sense those
terms are useful in this Controversy, and
<pb facs="tcp:54465:11"/>
are accommodate enough to the design
and purpose for which I use them, how
repugnant soever they are in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
wherein the Learned contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Use and Application of them.</p>
            <p>To be plain, when I say, Faith ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies
us as an <hi>Organ</hi> or <hi>Instrument;</hi> my
only meaning is, that it receives, or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
the Righteousness of Christ, by
which we are justified; and so speaking
to the <hi>Quomodo,</hi> or manner of our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
I say with the general Suffrage
of Divines, we are justified instrumental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by Faith.</p>
            <p>But in our Controversy with the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians,</hi>
where another different Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is moved about the <hi>Quando,</hi> or time
of our actual Justification; there I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
that we are actually justified at the
time of our believing, and not before;
and this being the Act upon which our
Justification is suspended, I call Faith
the <hi>Condition</hi> of our Justification.</p>
            <p>This, I desire, may be observed, lest
in my use of both those terms, my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
should think, either that I am not
aware of the Controversy depending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
those terms; or, that I do herein
manifest the vacillancy of my Judgment,
as if I leaned sometime to one side, and
<pb facs="tcp:54465:11"/>
sometime to another. I speak not here,
<hi>ad idem,</hi> as they do in that Contest; but
when I call it a <hi>Condition</hi> of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
my meaning is, that no Man is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
until he believe. And when I
call it an <hi>Instrument,</hi> my meaning is, that
it is the Righteousness of Christ appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
by Faith, which doth justify us
when we believe. And so I find the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality
of our Divines calling Faith some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a Condition, and sometimes an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of our Justification, as here I do.</p>
            <p>And if there be any Expression my
Reader shall meet with, which is less ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate,
and may be capable of another
sense: I crave that Candor from him,
that he interpret it according to this my
declared Intention.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Lastly,</hi> I have added to the former,
a short, plain, practical Sermon, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Peace and Unity of the Churches
of Christ, and prevent their Relapse into
past Follies.</p>
            <p>In all the Parts of this Discourse, I
have sincerely aimed at the Purity and
Peace of the Church of God; and he
greatly mistakes, that takes me for a Man
of Contention. 'Tis true, I am here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
with my Brethren, but pure
necessity brought me in; an unpleasing
<pb facs="tcp:54465:12"/>
irksomeness hath attended me through it,
and an hearty desire, and serious moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for Peace amongst all the professed
Members of Christ, shall close and finish
it. Let all Litigations of this nature (at
least, in this Critical Juncture) be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended
by common Consent, since they
waste our time, hinder our Communion,
imbitter our Spirits, impoverish practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Godliness, grieve the Spirit of God,
and good Men, make sport for our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Enemies, who warm their own
Fingers at the Fire of our Contentions;
and place more Trust in our dividing
Lusts, than they do in their own feeble
Arguments, or castrated Penal Laws, to
effect our Ruin.</p>
            <p>It is my grief (the Lord knows) to
see the delightful Communion the Saints
once enjoyed, whilst they walked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
under the same Ordinances of God,
now dissolved in such a sad and scandalous
Degree, by the Impressions of erroneous
Opinions, made both upon their Heads
and Hearts. I do therefore heartily joyn
with <hi>Budaeus</hi> in his pious Wish,<note n="*" place="margin">Utinam tam conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis manibus compertam comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samque ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel reti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

God would give his People as much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
in retaining the Truths they once
received, as they had Joy and Comfort
at their first Reception of them. I must
<pb facs="tcp:54465:12"/>
in this occasion declare my just Jealousy,
that the Non-improvement of our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal
Covenant unto the great and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Ends thereof in our Mortification,
Vivification, and regular Communion
with the Church of Christ, into which So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
we were matriculated by it; is at this
day punished upon Professors in those
fiery Heats, and fierce Oppositions, unto
which God seemeth to have penally deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
us at this day.</p>
            <p>For my own part, it is my fixed Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to provoke no good man if I can
help it. But if their own intemperate Zeal
shall provoke them, in pursuit of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
to destroy the very nature of God's
Covenant of Grace with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his
Seed, and I have a plain call (as here I
had) at once to defend God's Truths and
my Peoples Souls against them, I will ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
contend in the Cause of Truth,
whilst I can move my Tongue, or make
use of the Pen of the Scribe.</p>
            <p>Reader, I shall appeal to thee, if thou
be wise and impartial, Whether any man
that understands the Covenant of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
with <hi>Abraham</hi> (which is the grand
Charter, by which we and our Children
hold and enjoy the most invaluable Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges)
can endure to see it dissolved and
<pb facs="tcp:54465:13"/>
utterly destroyed, by making it an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant of Works; and
stand by as an unconcerned Spectator,
when challenged and provoked to speak
in defence thereof?</p>
            <p>Is there any thing found in God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17. to make
it an abolished Covenant of Works, which
doth not as injuriously bear upon, and
strike at the very life of the Covenant of
Grace in the last and best Edition of it,
under which the whole Church of God
now stands? What is that thing (I would
fain know) in God's Covenant with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham?</hi>
Is it the Promissory part of it,
<hi>I will be a God unto thee, and to thy
Seed after thee,</hi> Gen. 17. 7? God forbid:
for the essential and sweetest part of the
New Covenant is contained in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<hi>Ier. 31. 33. Heb.</hi> 8. 10. Yet thou
wilt find my <hi>Antagonist</hi> here forced to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
God may become a Peoples God in a
special manner by virtue of the abolished
Covenant of Works; and such he makes
this Covenant to be.</p>
            <p>Or does the <hi>Restipulation Abraham</hi> and
his were here required to make unto God,
even <hi>to walk before him, and be perfect;</hi>
doth this make it an <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant of
Works? Surely no. For as God there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb facs="tcp:54465:13"/>
perfection of <hi>Abraham,</hi> so Christ
requires the same perfection of all New-covenant
Foederates now, <hi>Matth. 5. 48.
Be ye perfect, as your Father which is in
Heaven is perfect;</hi> which is altogether as
much as ever God required of <hi>Abraham</hi>
and his, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. Take Perfection
in what sense you will, either for a <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
Perfection, consisting in truth and
sincerity; or a <hi>comparative</hi> Perfection,
consisting in the growth and more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
degrees of Grace; or a <hi>superlative</hi>
Perfection, which all New-covenant Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates
strive after here, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12, 13-
and shall certainly attain in Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi>
12. 23. In this also the Covenant with
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and with us, are truly and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantially
one and the same.</p>
            <p>Or doth my mistaken Friend imagine,
that God required this Perfection of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
and his, as in the First Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
he required it from <hi>Adam,</hi> and all
his? <hi>viz.</hi> to be performed and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his own strength, under penalty
of the Curse; but now though Christ
command perfection, yet what duty lies
in any command, answerable strength
for it lies in the Promise? Very well,
and was it not so then? compare the
Command, <hi>Deuter. 10. 16. Circumcise
<pb facs="tcp:54465:14"/>
therefore the fore-skins of your hearts,</hi> with
the answerable gracious Promise to enable
them so to do, <hi>Deut. 30. 6. The Lord thy
God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart
of thy Seed, to love the Lord thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or lastly, Did Circumcision, the Sign
and Seal added to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant,
make it an <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant of Works?
That's equally impossible with the former:
for no man, but such a daring Man as I am
concerned with, will dare to say, that <hi>a
Seal of the righteousness of Faith</hi> (as Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
was, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11.) can make
the Covenant, to which it is affixed (and
which I have shewn in all the other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
parts, the very same with that we
are now under) to become an <hi>Adam</hi>'s Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Works.</p>
            <p>These things I have here superadded,
to leave as little as is possible behind me to
be an occasion of further trouble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.
Let all strife therefore in so plain
a case be ended: Contentious Spirits are
not the most excellent Spirits among
Christians. Fire (and so Contention) is
more apt to catch in low-built thatcht
Cottages, than in high-built Castles, and
Princely Palaces: the higher we go, still
the more peace. The highest Region is
most sedate and calm. Stars have the
<pb facs="tcp:54465:14"/>
strongest influence, when in conjunction.
Angels (tho legions) have no wars among
them; and as willingly go down, as up the
Ladder, without justling each other. And
the Most High God is the God of Peace;
let us also be the Children of Peace. And
I do assure the Persons with whom I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
That whilst they hold the head, and
are tender of the Churches Peace, I can
live in charity with them here, and hope
to live in glory with them hereafter.</p>

spring up with Liberty
(though the restraint of

I judged it necessary at this

Rise, Causes, and Remedies of several
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54465:26"/>
Mistakes and Errors, under which even
the Reformed Churches among us, as
well as others, do groan at this Day.</p>
               <p>I will not stay my Reader long upon
the Etymology and Derivations of the
Word. We all know that Etymologies
are no Definitions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet because they
cast some light upon the Nature of the
thing we enquire after, it will not be lost
labour to observe that this word <hi>ER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROR</hi>
derives it self from three Roots in
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language.</p>
               <p>(1.) The Frst word Primitively sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
to deviate or decline from the true
Scope or path,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> Chatta, a Scopo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berravit.</note> as Unskilful Marks-men,
or Ignorant and Inadvertent Travellers
use to do. The least variation or turning
aside from the true Rule and Line, tho
it be but an hairs breadth, presently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
an Error. We read, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 20. 16.
of 700. <hi>Benjamites,</hi> who could every
one sling stones at an hairs breadth, and
not miss, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> and not err.
This by a <hi>Metaphor</hi> is applied to the Mind
or Judgment of man; and denotes the
warpings thereof from the Straight, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
Divine Law or Rule, and is usually
Translated by the word <hi>Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) It is derived from another word
also, which signifies to wander in varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54465:26"/>
and uncertain motions: You find it
in the Title of the <hi>7th. Psalm, Shiggaion</hi>

                     </gap> Shaga.</note> or a Song
of variable Notes and Tunes, higher and
lower, sharper and flatter. In both the
former Derivations it seems to note sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Error through meer Weakness and
Ignorance. But then</p>
               <p>(3.) In its Derivation from a third
Root, it signifies not only to Err, but to
cause others to Err also; and so signifies a
Seducer, or one that is active in leading
others into a wrong way; and is applied
in that sense to the <hi>Prophets</hi> in <hi>Israel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> takes in both these
senses, both to go astray, and when put
Transitively, to lead or cause others to go
astray with us. Hence is the word

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Planets</hi> or wandring Stars; the
title given by the Apostle <hi>Iude ver.</hi> 13.
to the false Teachers and Seducers of his
time.</p>
               <p>An Error then is any departure or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation
in our Opinions or Judgments
from the perfect Rule of the Divine
Law: And to this all men by nature are
not only liable, but inclinable. Indeed
man by Nature can do nothing else but
Err, <hi>Psal. 58. 3. he goeth astray as soon as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54465:27"/>
born;</hi> makes not one true step till renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Grace, and many false ones after
his Renovation. The Life of the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
man is a <hi>Book</hi> with many <hi>Errata</hi>'s;
but the whole <hi>Edition</hi> of a wicked man's
Life is but one continued Error; he that
thinks he cannot Err, manifestly Errs in
so thinking. The <hi>Pope</hi>'s supposed and
pretended <hi>Infallibility</hi> hath made him the
great deceiver of the World. A good
man may Err, but is willing to know his
Error, and will not obstinately maintain
it, when he once plainly discerns it.</p>
               <p>Error and Heresy among other things
differ in this; Heresie is accompanied
with pertinacy; and therefore the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick
is <gap reason="foreign">

his own Conscience condemns him,
whilst men labour in vain to convince
him. He doth not formally and in terms
Condemn himself, but he doth so equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valently,
whilst he continues to own and
maintain Doctrines and Opinions which
he finds himself unable to defend against
the evidence of Truth. Humane frailty
may lead a man into the first, but De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilish
Pride fixes him in the last.</p>
               <p>The word of God which is our rule,
must therefore be the only Test and
Touchstone to try and discover Errors;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54465:27"/>
for <hi>Regula est index sui &amp; obliqui.</hi> 'Tis not
enough to convince a man of Error, that
his Judgment differs from other mens;
you must bring it to the Word, and try
how it agrees or disagrees therewith;
else he that charges another with Error,
may be found in as great or greater an
Error himself. None are more dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
easily to receive and tenaciously to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
Errors, than those who are the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesignani,</hi>

               <p>The following Discourse justly entitles

find the Roots of many Errors laid bare

which I here mention together,
many of them springing from the same
Root: Yet I am far from censuring them
alike; nor would I have any that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in lesser Errors be exasperated,
because their lesser Mistakes are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with greater and more pernicious
ones; this Candor I not only intreat,

<hi>try words, as the mouth tasteth meat?</hi>
Knowledg is the assimilation of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
to the truths received by it.
Nothing is more natural to man, than a
desire to know: Knowledg never cloys
the Mind, as food doth the natural Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite;
but as the one increaseth, the other
is proportionably sharpened and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
The Minds of all (that are not
wholly immers'd in Sensuality) spend
their Strength in the laborious search and
pursuit of Truth. Sometimes climbing up
from the Effects to the Causes, and then
descending again from the Causes to the
Effects; and all to discover Truth. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Prayer, sedulous Study, fixed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations,
are the labours of inquisitive
Souls after Truth. All the Objections
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54465:29"/>
and Counter-arguments the mind meets
in its way, are but the pauses and hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of a bivious Soul, not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
whether Truth lies upon this
side, or upon that.</p>
                  <p>Answerable to the sharpness of the
Minds appetite, is the fine edg of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and Delight it feels in the discovery
and acquisition of Truth. When it
hath Rack'd and Tortured it self upon
knotty <hi>Problems,</hi> and at last discovered
the Truth it sought for; with what joy
doth the Soul dilate it self, and run (as
it were with open arms) to clasp and
welcome it?</p>
                  <p>The Understanding of man at first was
perspicacious and clear, all Truths lay ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious

beauty before it: <hi>God made man upright,
Eccl.</hi> 7. 29. this rectitude of his mind

Truth in the Mind, or the Minds union
with Truth, being part of the Divine
Image in man, discovers to us the Sin
and Mischief of Error, which is a defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

it was by a Scripture-consequence,

The <hi>Arrians</hi> and other <hi>Hereticks</hi> rejected

                  <p>Some think that reason and natural

us about natural and earthly
things; yet they are utterly insufficient to
guide us in spiritual and heavenly things,

                        <hi>Vnto the Attainment of Divine Knowledg
out of the Scriptures, some things are
naturally, yet less principally requisite in
the Subject; and something absolutely
and principally necessary.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>The natural qualifications desirable in
the Subject, are clearness of Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
solidity of Judgment, and fidelity
of Retention. These are desirable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisites
to make the Understanding susce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible
of knowledg; but the irradiation
of the mind by the Spirit of God, is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
necessary, <hi>Joh. 16. 13. He shall
guide you into all truth:</hi> The clearest and
most comfortable light he giveth to men,
is in the way of Sanctification, called the
teachings of the Anointing, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 27.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:54465:31"/>
When this spiritual sanctifying light
shines upon a mind, naturally enriched
and qualified with the three foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
requisites, that Mind excels others in
the riches of knowledg. And yet the
teachings of the Spirit in the way of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
do very much supply and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
the defects and weaknesses of
the forementioned qualifications. Whence
two things are highly remarkable:</p>
                  <p>1. That men of great abilities of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
clear apprehensions in natural
things, strong Judgments, and tenacious
memories, do not only frequently fall into
gross Errors and damnable <hi>Heresies</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
but become <hi>Heresiarchs,</hi> or Heads of
erroneous Factions, drawing multitudes
into the same sin and misery with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
as <hi>Arrius, Socinus, Pelagius,
Bellarmin,</hi> and multitudes of others
have done.</p>
                  <p>And secondly, It is no less remarkable,
that men of weaker parts, but Babes in
comparison, through the Sanctification
and direction of the Spirit, for which
they have humbly waited at his feet in
Prayer, have not only been directed and
guided by him into the Truth, but so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
and fixed therein, that they have
been kept sound in their Judgments in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54465:31"/>
times of abounding Errors, and firm in
their adherence to it in days of fiercest
Persecution. How men of excellent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
parts have been blinded, and men
of weak natural parts illuminated; see
1 <hi>Cor. 1. 26, 27. Matth.</hi> 11. 25.</p>

of the mind puffs it up with a vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that it is not only able to penetrate
the deepest Mysteries revealed in the
Scripture, but even unrevealed secrets
also, <hi>Col. 2. 18. intruding into those things

his fleshly mind.</hi> But <hi>Error</hi> militates directly
against it, contradicts and opposeth Truth,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54465:32"/>
especially when an Error is maintained
by pride against inward convictions, or
means of better information. 'Tis bad
to maintain an Error for want of light;
but abundantly worse to maintain it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
light. This is such an affront to
the Spirit of God, as he usually punishes

to a spirit of Error.</p>

                     <hi>Antiquity</hi> is a venerable word, but ill
used, when made a cloak for Error.
Truth must needs be elder than Error,
as the Rule must necessarily be, before
the ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

of Opinions are then only Beauty, and
a Crown, when found in the way of
Righteousness. <hi>Copper</hi> (saith Learned
<hi>Dumoulin</hi>) will never become Gold by
Age. A Lye will be a Lye, let it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so ancient. We dispute not by Years,
but by Reasons drawn from Scripture.
That which is now call'd an Ancient O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
if it be not a true Opinion, was
once but a new Error. When you can
tell us how many years are required to
turn an Error into Truth, then we will
give more heed to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> when
press'd in the service of Error, than we
now think due to it.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Antiquity</hi> will not do, Reason shall
be press'd to serve Error's turn at a dead
lift; and indeed the <hi>Pencil</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi>
can lay curions Colours upon rotten <hi>Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:54465:37"/>
and varnish over erroneous Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
with fair and plausible pretences.
What expert Artists have the <hi>Socinians</hi>
proved themselves in this matter? But
because men are bound to submit human
Authority and Reason to Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
both must give way and strike sail
to the Written Word.</p>
                  <p>Hence it comes to pass, that the great
<hi>Patrons</hi> and <hi>Factors</hi> for Error, do above
all things labour to gain countenance to
their Errors from the Written Word; and
to this end they manifestly wrest and rack
the Scriptures to make them subservient
to their Opinions; not impartially study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scriptures first, and forming their
notions and opinions according to them;
but they bring their Erroneous Opinions
to the Scriptures, and then with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
art and sophistry wiredraw and
force the Scriptures to countenance and
legitimate their Opinions<note n="†" place="margin">Cum u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naquaeque Haeresis sui commenti parentem habeat Diabolum, ac pudore tàm exosi nominis teneatur; pulcherrimum, &amp; quod super omnia est, nomen Salvatoris profitetur, Scripturarumque dictionibus amici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, <hi>Athanas. contra Arian</hi>

                        <hi>God in all ages in his tender care for his

provided <hi>Antidotes</hi> against the poisonous
<hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Animals</hi> of the Countrey;
and the one is never far from the other:
So is the care of his Providence much
more conspicuous in the case now before
us. When, or wheresoever venomous
<hi>Errors</hi> and deadly <hi>Heresies</hi> do arise, he
hath his servants at hand with <hi>Antidotes</hi>

When <hi>Arrius,</hi> that cunning and
deadly Enemy to the Deity of Christ,
struck at the very heart of our Religion,
Faith and Comfort; a man of subtil
Parts, and Blameless Life, which made
his Heresie much the more spreading and
taking; the Lord had his well-furnished
<hi>Athanasius</hi> in a readiness to resist and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
him. And as he had his <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>
to defend the Deity of <hi>Christ;</hi> so he
wanted not his <hi>Basil</hi> to defend the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Holy Spirit against <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>so when <hi>Pelagius</hi> was busily advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<hi>Free-will</hi> into the Throne of <hi>Free-grace,</hi>
Providence wanted not its Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
in Learned and Ingenious <hi>Augustin,</hi> to
break him and his Idol to pieces: And
it is highly remarkable (as the Learned
D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Hill</hi> observes) that <hi>Augustin</hi> was
born in <hi>Africa</hi> the same day that <hi>Pelagius</hi>
was born in <hi>Brittain.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>When Gotteschalcus</hi> published his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Doctrine about <hi>Predestination,</hi>
the Lord drew forth <hi>Hincmarus</hi> to detect
and confute that Error, by evincing
clearly, that God's Predestination forces
no man to Sin.</p>
                  <p>So from the beginning and first rise of
<hi>Popery,</hi> that centre and sink of Errors,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54465:38"/>
we have a large Catalogue of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

it; and when notwithstanding all, it
had even over-run <hi>Europe</hi> like a rapid
Torrent, or rather Inundation of the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean:</hi>
And <hi>Germany</hi> was brought to that
pass, that if the <hi>Pope</hi> had but Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it, they would have eaten Grass or

bring forth Invincible <hi>Luther,</hi> and with
him a troop of Learned Champions, into
the field against him; since which time
the Cause of <hi>Popery</hi> is become desperate.</p>
                  <p>Thus the care of Providence in all ages

the Church against the dangers that
arose from false Brethren within it, as

                  <p>What is Opinion, but the wavering

In such cases there should be
a due concession and allowance of other

whilst they offer as fair for the Truth as
we? And haply their Parts, Helps, and
Industries, arenot inferior to ours, it may
be beyond them, and we may discern in
them as much tenderness of Conscience,
and fear of Sin as in our selves. In this
case a little more modest Suspicion in our

False Doctrines are fit Plagues for false

which provokes God to inflict this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
None likelier to make <hi>Seducers</hi>
than <hi>Boasters, Iude 16. Arrius</hi> gloried
that God had revealed some things to
him, which were hidden from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
themselves. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> boasted
himself to be the mighty Power of God.

2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. the sublime and mysterious
nature of the matter rendering it so: and
some things hard to be interpreted from
the manner of expression; as indeed all
mystical parts of Scripture and Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
predictions are, and ought to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
The Spirit of God this way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly
casts a veil over them, till the
proper season of their revelation and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
be come. Besides (as the
Learned <hi>Glassius</hi> observes) in <hi>Paul</hi>'s style
there are found some peculiar words and
forms of speech, which ordinary Rules of
<hi>Grammar</hi> take no notice, nor give any
parallel Examples of: as <hi>to be buried with
Christ; to be baptized into his death;</hi> to
which I may add, <hi>to be circumcised in
him,</hi> &amp;c. There are also multitude of
words found in Scripture of various and
vastly different Significations: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
there is a diversity, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a contrariety of senses given of
them by <hi>Expositors;</hi> which to an <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourist</hi>
or quarrelsome Wit gives an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to vent his Errors with a plausible
appearance of Scripture-consent. And
indeed <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, <hi>Non periclitor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
ipsas Scripturas ità dispositas esse, ut
materiam subministrarent Haereticis.</hi> The
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54465:49"/>
Scriptures are so disposed, that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
may pick Occasions; and those
that will not be satisfied, may be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened. See <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>But all this notwithstanding, the great
and necessary things to our Salvation are
so perspicuously and plainly revealed in
the Scriptures, that even Babes in Christ
do apprehend and understand them,
<hi>Matth. 11. 25. 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 27, 28, 29. And
though there be difficulties in other
points more remote from the foundation;
yet the Spirit of God is not to be accused,
but rather his Wisdom to be admired
herein. For (1.) this serves to excite
our most intense study and diligence,
which by this difficulty is made necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 3, 4, 5. the very <hi>Prophets,</hi>
yea the very <hi>Angels</hi> search into these
things, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11, 12. (2.) Hereby a
standing Ministry in the Church is made
necessary, <hi>Nehem. 8. 8. Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13.
So that to pretend <hi>Obscurity</hi> of Scripture
to be the culpable cause of <hi>Error,</hi> when
indeed the fault is in our selves; this is
too much like our Father <hi>Adam,</hi> which
would implicitly accuse God, to exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and recover that just Right, and

'Tis commanded by Christ, <hi>Iohn 5. 39.

by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Bereans,</hi> Acts 17. 11.
<hi>These were more noble than those in Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salonica,
in that they received the Word
with all readiness of mind, and searched
the scriptures daily whether those things
were so.</hi> This <hi>Liberty</hi> is not allowed in
that latitude in any Religion, as it is in
the Christian Religion, nor enjoyed in
its full liberty, as it is in the Reformed
Religion, whose glory it is that it allows
its Principles and Doctrines to be critical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
examined and tryed of all Men by the
Rule of the Word, as well knowing,
the more it is sifted and searched by its
Professors, the more they will be still
confirmed and satisfied in the truth of it.</p>

                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:54465:52"/>
But yet this gracious and just liberty
of Christians, suffers a double abuse: One
from the <hi>Popish</hi> Enemies, who injurious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
restrain and deny it to the people.
Another, by Protestants themselves, who
sinfully stretch and extend it beyond the
just degree and measure in which Christ
allows it to them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> injuriously restrains it, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the danger that must necessarily
follow the concession of such a liberty to
the people, to compare his superstitious
and erroneous Doctrines with the Rule
of the Word.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. tells the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
they have a more sure Word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
whereunto they do well that they
take heed. Certainly the <hi>Pope</hi> forgot
either that he was <hi>Peter</hi>'s Successour;
or that ever St. <hi>Peter</hi> told the people they
did well to make use of that liberty,
which he denies them. Mr. <hi>Pool</hi> tells
us of a <hi>Spaniard</hi> that used this expression
to an <hi>English</hi> Merchant, <hi>You people of</hi>
England (said he) <hi>are happy, you have
liberty to see with your own eyes, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the Doctrines delivered to you, upon
which your everlasting Life depends; but
we dare not say our souls are our own, but
are commanded to believe whatever our

<hi>SLOTHFVLNESS</hi> and careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in a due and serious search of the
whole Scripture, with a sedate and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
consideration of every part and
particle therein, which may give us any,
though the least light to understand the
mind of God in those obscure and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
points we search after the knowledg
of.</p>
                  <p>Truth lies deep, as the rich Veins of
Gold do, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. If we will get the

as he speaks, <hi>Prov. 14. 23. The talk of
the lips tends only to poverty.</hi> We are not
to take up with that which lies upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
and next at hand upon the surface
of the Text; but to search with the most
sedate and considerative mind into all
parts of the written Word, examining
every Text which hath any respect to
the truth we are searching for, heedfully
to observe the Scope, Antecedents, and
Consequents, and to value every <hi>Apex,

Divine Authority, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 18. and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
greater weight is laid upon a small
word, yea, upon the addition or change
of a Letter in a word, as appears in the
names of <hi>Abram</hi> and <hi>Sarai.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It will require some strength of mind,
and great sedulity, to lay all parts of
Scripture before us, and to compare
words with words, and things with
things, as the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 13.
comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</hi>
And though it be true that some impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Doctrines, as that of <hi>Iustification</hi> by
<hi>Faith,</hi> are methodically disposed, and
throughly clear'd and setled in one and
the same Context; yet it is as true, that
very many other points of Faith and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
are not so digested, but are delivered
<hi>sparsinì,</hi> here a little, and there a little,
as he speaks, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 10. You must not
think to find all that belongs to one Head
or Point of Faith, or Duty, lay'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in a <hi>System,</hi> or common place in
Scripture; but scattered abroad in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
pieces, some in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi>
and some in the <hi>New,</hi> at a great distance
one from another.</p>
                  <p>Now in our searches and inquiries af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the full and satisfying knowledg of
the Will of God in such Points, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54465:56"/>
that the whole Word of God be
throughly searched, and all those parcels
brought together to an interview. <hi>Ex.

                  </p>
                  <p>If a Man would see the entire disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
that was made of Christ, to the
Fathers, under the <hi>Old-Testament,</hi> he
shall not find it laid together in any one
Prophet; but shall find that one speaks
to one part of it, and another to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> gives the first general hint of it,
<hi>Gen. 3. 15. The seed of the woman shall break
the serpents head.</hi> But then if you would
know more particularly of whose Seed
according to the flesh, he should come,
you must turn to <hi>Gen. 22. 18. In thy seed</hi>
(saith God to <hi>Abraham) shall all nations of
the earth be blessed.</hi> And if you yet
doubt what Seed God means there, you
must go to the Apostle, <hi>Gal. 3. 16. To
thy seed,</hi> which is <hi>Christ.</hi> If you would
further know the place of his Nativity,
the <hi>Prophet Micha</hi> must inform you of
that, <hi>Mic.</hi> 5. 2. it should be <hi>Bethlehem-Ephrata.</hi>
If you inquire of the quality
of his Parent, another <hi>Prophet</hi> gives you
that, <hi>Isa. 7. 14. Behold, a Virgin shall
conceive, and bear a Son, and call his name
Immanuel.</hi> If the time of his Birth be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54465:57"/>
inquired after, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> must
inform you of that, <hi>Gen. 49. 10. Dan.</hi> 9. 24.</p>
                  <p>So under the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> If a Man
inquire about the change of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
he must not expect to find a formal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
of the Seventh day, and an express
institution of the first day in its room;
but he is to consider,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> What the <hi>Evangelist</hi> speaks,
<hi>Mark</hi> 2. 28. That Christ is Lord of the
Sabbath, and so had power, not only to
dispense with it, but to change it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That on the first day of the
Week Christ rose from the dead, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.
1, 2. And that this is that great day,
foretold to be the day to be solemnized
upon that account, <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. 24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That accordingly the first
day of the Week is emphatically styled
the Lord's day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. where you
find his own name written upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> You shall find this was the
day on which the <hi>Apostles</hi> and Primitive
Christians assembled together for the
stated and solemn performance of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worship, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 19. and other
publick Church-Acts and Duties, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
16. 1, 2. And so by putting together,
and considering all these Particulars, we
draw a just Conclusion, That it is the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54465:57"/>
Will of God, that since the Resurrection
of Christ, the first day of the week
should be observed as the Christian-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</p>
                  <p>In like manner as for the Baptizing of
Believers <hi>Infants;</hi> We are not to expect
it in the express words of a <hi>New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>-Institution
or Command, that <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi>
under the Gospel should be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed;
but God hath left us to gather sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
about his Will and our Duty in
that point, by comparing and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the several Scriptures of the <hi>Old</hi> and
<hi>New-Testament</hi> which relate to that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
which if we be impartial and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derative,
we may do,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> By considering, that by God's
express Command, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9, 10. the
Infant Seed of his People were taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Covenant with their Parents, and the
then Sign of that Covenant commanded
to be applied to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That though the Sign be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
the Promise and Covenant is still
the same, and runs as it did before, to
Believers and their Children, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.
38, 39.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the foederal holiness of
our Children is plainly asserted under the
<hi>New-Testament, 1 Cor. 7. 14. Rom.</hi> 11. 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:54465:58"/>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We shall further find, that
<hi>Baptism</hi> succeeds in the room of <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi>
and that by an Argument drawn
from the compleatness of our Privileges
under the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> no way infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
but rather more extensive than
those of the <hi>Iews, Col.</hi> 2. 10, 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> We shall find that upon the
Conversion of any <hi>Master</hi> or <hi>Parent,</hi> the
whole Houshold were Bapized. By put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all these things, with some others,
together, we may arrive to the desired
satisfaction about the Will of God in this
matter.</p>
                  <p>But some Men want abilities, and
others are too sluggish and lazy to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
together, compare and weigh all
these and many more hints and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
of the Mind of God, which
would give much light unto this point;
but they take an easier and cheaper way
to satisfy themselves with what lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost
upon the surface of Scripture,
and so, as it were by consent, let go,
and lose their own, and their Childrens
blessed and invaluable Privileges, for
want of a little labour and patience to
search the Scriptures; a folly which few
would be guilty of, if but a small earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inheritance were concerned therein.</p>

enjoyned by his Soveraign Command,

                     <p>Remarkable is that Text to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,

that Will of God, for the discovery

<hi>viz. Good, Acceptable,</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
Good</hi> it must needs be, because the

O what a mercy would it be to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors

Truths of Christ! Happy is that man
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54465:63"/>

                     <p>To this sense sound the Apostle's
words, <hi>Col. 2. 6, 7. As you have therefore
received Christ Iesus the Lord, so walk ye
in him, rooted and built up in him, and
stablished in the faith, as you have been
taught. Fertility and stability</hi> in Christ,
a pair of inestimable Blessings, depend
upon a good rooting of the Soul in him at
first. He that thrusts a dead stick into
the ground, may easily pull it up again,
but so he cannot do by a well-rooted
Tree. A colour raised by violent action,
or a great fire, soon dies away; but that
which is natural or constitutional will
hold. Every thing is as its foundation
is. 'Twas want of a good root and due

                  <p>When there is in the Soul more heat

the <hi>Iewish Bigots,</hi> Rom. 10. 2. as the

about the great point of <hi>Iustification:</hi>
and surely no man understood the evil
of it more than he, who in his unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
state was transported by it to the
most furious persecution of the <hi>Saints,
Acts</hi> 26. 11. and even to dotage, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme

                  <p>Blind <hi>Zeal</hi> is a Sword in a Mad-man's

one, whose Erroneous Conscience offers
up the blood of the Saints to the glory of
God, <hi>Iob.</hi> 16. 2. The blind, but zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<hi>Pharisees</hi> would compass Sea and

not well: yea, they would exclude you

that you might affect them.</p>
                  <p>And as it is the great Instrument by
which <hi>Satan</hi> propagates <hi>Errors,</hi> so it
makes a fit temper in the Souls of the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54465:76"/>
People to receive them. For by this
means <hi>Error</hi> gains the possession of the
Affections, without passing a previous
and due test by the Understanding, and
so gains the Soul by the advantage of a
Surprize. Every thing, by how much
the more weak and ignoble it is, by so
much the more it watcheth upon Surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
and Advantages. <hi>Error</hi> cares not
to endure the due examination and test
of Reason; and therefore seeks to gain
by surprisal, what it despairs of ever
gaining by a plain and fair tryal.</p>
                  <p>There be few <hi>Errorists</hi> in the World of

<hi>Sex.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From this <hi>blind Zeal</hi> it is, that they
cunningly wind their Erroneous Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions

into a flame, it breaks the nearest bonds

the Devil's work of Persecution
throughly, and to purpose. They'l rush
violently and head-long into the blood of
their dearest Relations, or most eminent

sharp Spur. Superstitious Zeal draws
all the strength and power of the Soul
into that one Design; and wo to him
that stands in the way of such a man, if
God interpose not betwixt him and the
stroke. It was a rational wish of him
that said, <hi>Liberet me Deus ab homine unius

                     <p>Pray earnestly for a thorow change of
the state and temper of thy Soul, by
sound <hi>Conversion</hi> and <hi>Regeneration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Conversion turns us from darkness to
light; and from the power of Satan to
God, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. They are his own
slaves and vassals that are taken captive
by him at his will, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 16. A San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
heart is a Soveraign defensative
against Erroneous Doctrines; it furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
the Soul with spiritual eyes, judicious
ears, and a distinguishing taste, by which
it may discern both good and evil, truth
and error, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 14. yea, it puts the
Soul at once under the conduct of the
Spirit, and protection of the Promise,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 13. and though this doth not
secure a Man from all lesser mistakes,
yet it effectually secures him from great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ones, which are inconsistent with
Christ and Salvation.</p>

they be pleasant sounds to both ears, yet
the wary Soul will examine, before it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
and admit Doctrinal Points under
these gilded Titles. Those that have
made their Observations upon the strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems
of Satan, will heedfully observe
both the tendency of Doctrines, and the
Lives of their Teachers; and if they find
looseness, pride, wantonness in them,
it is not a glorious title, or magnificent
name that shall charm them. They
know Satan can transform himself into
an Angel of Light; and no wonder if
his Ministers also be transformed into
Ministers of Righteousness, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.

we come next to consider the <hi>Instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>FALSE TEACHER,</hi>
whom Satan makes use of as his Seeds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,

The choice of Instruments is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
part of Satan's policy. Every one is
not fit to be employed in such a Service
as this. All are not fit to be of the
Council of War, who yet take their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

                  <p>The first Instrument chosen by Satan
to deceive Man, was the Serpent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that Creature was more subtil than

The knowledg of them is a good defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sative

                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> They usually seek to disgrace and

and to beget credit and reputation to
those Errors which they have a mind to

<hi>&amp;c</hi> fall under disgrace with many,
and indeed all qualifications and pre-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisites
unto coming to Christ, as things
not only needless, but pernicious unto
the Souls of Men, although they have
not the least dependance upon them:
Yea, Faith it self, as a pre-requisite unto

the false Teachers would have brought

which obtains greatly in the World; and
no Doctrine like the <hi>Pelagian</hi> and <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelagian</hi>

that sets fallen Nature upon its Legs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and persuades it, it can go alone
to Christ; at least, with a little external
help of Moral suasion, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
or creating work in the Soul.
This goes down glib and grateful.</p>
                     <p>And then for <hi>Fleshly Liberty,</hi> How do
those that are fond of it rejoice in that
Doctrine or Opinion, which looses Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

to think he hath liberty by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to let loose the reins of his Lust

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54465:87"/>
which tells him, the Gospel allows more
Liberty than severe Legal Teachers think

by them, to draw the minds of Men
from the Truth. Amongst which, that
which comes first to consideration, is the
great skill they have in representing the
<hi>ABVSES</hi> of the Ordinances of God,
and Duties of Religion, by wicked
Men, to scare tender and weak Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
from the due use of them, and
all further attendance upon them.</p>
                  <p>The abuse of Christ's holy Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are so cunningly improved to serve
this design, that the minds of many well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning
persons receive such deep dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust
at them, that they are scarce ever
to be reconciled to them again. A strong
prejudice is apt to drive Men from one
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54465:87"/>
extream upon another, as thinking they
can never get far enough off from that
which hath been so scaringly represented
to them. Thus making good the old
Observation, <hi>Dum vitant stulti vitia, in
contraria currunt;</hi> they run from the
troublesome smoak of Superstition, into
the Fire of an irreligious contempt of
God's Ordinances, split themselves upon
<hi>Charybdis</hi> to avoid <hi>Scylla. Ex. gra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Papists</hi> having deeply abused the
Ordinance of <hi>Baptism,</hi> by their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptive
mixtures and additions of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
<hi>Cross, Chrism,</hi> &amp;c. part
whereof is not sufficiently purged to this
day by the Reformation; and finding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
multitudes of carnal <hi>Protestants</hi> dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously
resting upon their supposed bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal
Regeneration, to the great hazard
of their Salvation; which mistake is but
too much countenanced by some of its
Administrators: They take from hence
such deep offence at the administration
of it to any Infants at all (though the
Seed of God's Covenanted People) that
they think they can never be sharp e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in their invectives against it; nor
have they patience to hear the most ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
defences of that Practise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:54465:88"/>
So, for that Scriptural Heavenly Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Singing:</hi> What more commonly
alledged against it, than the abuse and ill
effects of that precious Ordinance? How
often is the Nonsense and Error of the
common Translation, the rudeness and
dulness of the Metre of some <hi>Psalms,</hi> as
<hi>Psal.</hi> 7. 13. as also the cold formality,
with which that Ordinance is performed
by many who do but Parrotize? I say,
How often are these things buz'd into
the ears of the people, to alienate their
hearts from so sweet and beneficial a
Duty?</p>
                  <p>And very often we find it urged to the
same end, how unwarrantable and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
a thing it is for carnal and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
persons to appropriate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in Singing, those Praises and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences
which are peculiar to the Saints;
not understanding, or considering that
the singing of <hi>Psalms</hi> is an Ordinance of
Christ, appointed for teaching and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
as well as praising, <hi>Col. 3. 16.

Psalms and Hymns,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="*" place="margin">

If Satan can prevail first with wicked
Men, to corrupt and abuse God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
by the superstitious mixtures and
additions; and then with good Men, to
renounce and slight them for the sake of
those abuses; he fully obtains his design,
and gives Christ a double wound at once;
one by the hand of his avowed Enemies,
the other by the hands of his Friends, no
less grievous than the first. First, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men corrupt Christ's Ordinances; and
then good Men nauseate them.</p>

them in the Gospel-Charter? A Liberty
from Satan, Sin, and the rigour and

true, Christ came to be a Sacrifice for

abuses; and oftentimes through the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions

What then? Shall we renounce the

                     <p>The more they are abused and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

A good Man will strive to honour and
secure those Truths and Duties most,
which he finds under most disgrace or
danger. He loves the Truth sincerely,
who cleaves to it, and stands by it under
all opposition. This is a good tryal of
the soundness of thy heart, and purity of
thine ends in Religion: Such a proof, as
the honour and reputation of Religion
in the World can never give thee.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Solomon'</hi>s time the <hi>Iews</hi> were very

                  <p>Another Method and Artifice, by

the <hi>LIBERTY</hi> of <hi>PROPHESYING;</hi>

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54465:91"/>
fancy that they are wiser than their
Teachers; their Pride will quickly tempt
them to shew their Ignorance, and that
mischievous Ignorance will prove dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to the Truth, and troublesome to
the Church. The Apostle forbids the
Ordination of a <hi>Novice,</hi> lest he be puffed
up, and fall into the condemnation of the
Devil: and in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 7. he shews us
the reason why some swerved and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
aside unto vain jangling; and it was
this, That <hi>they desired to be Teachers of
the Law, neither understanding what they
said, nor whereof they affirmed.</hi> That is,
They affected to be Preachers, though
not able to speak congrucusly, with to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
sense and reason.</p>
                  <p>I do not here censure and condemn the
use and exercise of the Gifts of all private
Christians. There are to be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them some Persons of raised parts,
and answerable modesty and humility,
who may be very useful, when called to
service, in extraordinary Cases, by the
Voice of Providence; or exercise their
Gifts in a probationary way, or in due
subordination unto Christ's publick Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
and Ordinances, by, and with the
consent of the <hi>Pastor,</hi> and Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

But when unqualified and uncalled
Persons undertake such a work out of the
conceit and pride of their own hearts, or
are allured to it by the crafty Designs of
Erroneous Teachers, partly to overthrow
a publick, regular and standing Ministry
in the Church, to which end the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
are manifestly abused, such as <hi>Ier.

I here censure, which like a <hi>Trojan
Horse,</hi> hath sent forth multitudes of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
Persons into the City of God to
infest and defile it.</p>
                  <p>I cannot doubt but many a sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
may be drawn into such employment
whichputs him into a capacity of honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God in a more eminent way, which
is a thing desirable to an honest and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
heart: and that the temptation may
be greatly strengthened upon them by the
plausible suggestions of cunning Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
who tell them, That those <hi>Ministers</hi>
who oppose and condemn this practise,
do it as men concerned for their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
as desirous to monopolize the
work to themselves, and as envying the
Lord's People: and that Christ hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them a greater liberty in this case,
than those men will allow them. By
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54465:92"/>
this means they daw many after them,
and fix them in their Erroneous ways.</p>
                  <p>I have no mind at all here to expose

                  <p>In the beginning of our <hi>Reformation</hi>
by <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> &amp;c. there sprung up
a Generation of Men, called <hi>Swenkfeldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
great Pretenders to Revelations and
Visions, who were always speaking of
<hi>Deifications;</hi> and an higher strain of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
they commonly used among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,

and therefore scornfully entit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Orthodox and humble Christians,
who stuck to the Scripture-phrase, and
wholsome form of sound words, <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matists,
Vocabulists, Literalists,</hi> &amp;c. These
Men (as<note n="*" place="margin">Irretiti suis qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busdam Enthusia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticis la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queis, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de se ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricari summam putant impietatem: dementabant multos magnificis istis verbis, <hi>Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, Revelatio, Deificatio, &amp;c.</hi>

entangled in certain Enthusiastick Snares,
that they thought it the highest impiety

                  <p>Much of the same Spirit was <hi>Thomas

Iacob Behmen,</hi> &amp;c. whose cloudy Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense,
aenigmatical Expressions, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Obscurity, drew many into a strange
admiration of them: They all pretend to
an higher knowledge of Mysteries than
what the Gospel is acquainted with; and
and yet give us (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves)
neither <hi>Reasons</hi> with <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
nor <hi>Miracles</hi> with Christ, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,

Of the same Bran were our late <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> of whom <hi>Henry Nichols</hi>
was the chief Leader, who decried the
written Word as a dead Letter; and set
up their own fond Conceits and Fancies
under the notion of the Spirit; against
whom that heavenly and Learned Man,
Mr. <hi>Samuel Rutherford,</hi> seasonably and
succesfully appeared. <hi>Hacket, Coppinger</hi>
and <hi>Arthington,</hi> were of the same Tribe;
who lived a-while wrapt up in <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi>
Fancies, which at last brake forth
into the highest and most horrid Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies.</p>
                  <p>Another Art they make use of to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Credulous, is a pretence unto
the Spirit of Prophecy; and great suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
they promise themselves this way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the weak, but curious Vulgar.
And to this end Satan hath inspired and
employed some Cunninger Heads to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
very pleasing Predictions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,
in favour of that Party whom he
designs to deceive. And how catching
and bewitching these things are, gaining
more respect among these vain Spirits,
than the divine unquestionable Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Scripture, this Age hath had full

                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:54465:95"/>
Now the Design of Satan in these
things, is to gain credit to those <hi>Sects,</hi>
as People peculiarly favoured and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

the particular Favourites of Heaven, as
<hi>Daniel</hi> was; and so to draw the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

The Scripture (saith <hi>Luther</hi>) is so
full, that as for Visions and Revelations,
<hi>nec curo, nec desidero,</hi> I neither regard,
nor desire them. And when he himself
had a Vision of Christ after a day of fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and prayer, he cried out, <hi>Avoid Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
I know no Image of Christ, but the
Scripture.</hi> An hankering mind after

At length the Lord extorted from this
Woman a full Confession of the notorious
falseness of these things, by a terrible Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Hell: her Partizans laboured
four days to suppress and stifle it, but
to no purpose: for the Horrors of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
prevailed with her to confess the
notorious Dissimulations contained in
that Book, before the People of <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi>

                     <p>Consider how difficult, yea, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
it is for a man to determine that
such a Voice, Vision, or Revelation is

into an Angel of Light; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
abandoning all those unsafe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain

                  <p>Another way in which False Teachers
discover their Subtilty with great success,
is, in <hi>TIMING</hi> their Assaults, and
nicking the proper Season, when the
minds of men are most apt and easy to
be drawn away by their fair and specious
Pretences.</p>
                  <p>Such a Season as this, they find about
the time of mens first Conversion, or
soon after their Implantation into Christ.
Now it is that their Affections are most
lively and vigorous, though their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
be but weak. They have now such
strong and deep apprehensions of the
Grace and Love of Christ, and such
transcendent zeal for him, that they
easily embrace any thing whereby they
conceive he may be honoured and exalted.
They have also such deep Apprehensions
and powerful Aversations as to Sin, that
they are in danger to fly even from
Truth and Duty it felf, when it shall be
artificially represented to them as Sin.
For not only that which is <hi>malum per se,</hi>
Sin indeed; but that which is <hi>male colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum,</hi>
painted with Sin's Colours, is apt
to scare and fright them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:54465:98"/>
Besides, These young Converts or
Novices have not had time to confirm
and root themselves in the Truth; and
Trees newly planted are much more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
drawn up, than those that have spread
and fastened their Roots in the Earth.
'Tis observable what a swarm of false
Teachers troubled the Churches of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,
Galatia</hi> and <hi>Philippi,</hi> at, and new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after their first planting: and what
danger those young Christians were in,
abundantly appears in the Apostle's fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Cautions and holy Jealousy over
them: he bids them <hi>beware of Dogs,
beware of Evil Workers, beware of the
Concision,</hi> Phil. 3. 2. <hi>I fear lest by any
means as the Serpent beguiled Eve through
his s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from the simplicity that is in Christ,</hi> 2 Cor.
11. 3. he was afraid of the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
lest he had bestowed upon them labour in
vain, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 11. he would not give place
to false Brethren, no not for an hour,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 5. charges the <hi>Romans</hi> to receive
them that were weak in the faith, but not
to doubtful Disputations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1. All
which, and many more Expressions, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
his grounded jealousy, and their
extraordinary danger of seduction at their
first plantation. A Novice in Christianity
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54465:98"/>
is the Person Satan seeks for: strong Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
are not in such apparent danger
as little ones in Christ, 1 <hi>Iohn 5. 21. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Children, keep your selves from Idols.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the reason is, because keen Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
match'd with weak Judgments,
give a mighty advantage to Seducers.
Children are apt to be taken with beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Appearances, and fine shews; and
Erroneous Teachers have the very knack
to set a glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s of extraordinary sanctity
upon their dangerous Opinions. Hence
those Persons that promoted the Sect of
the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> made use of a cunning
Woman, who for her skill in painting
Errors with the Colours of Truth, got
the name of <hi>Iezebel,</hi> Rev. 2. 20. That
<hi>Queen</hi> was famous for the art of Painting,
1 <hi>King.</hi> 16. and so was this false <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tess:</hi>
indeed there was scarce any emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<hi>Sect</hi> of Errorists or Hereticks men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in Church-history, but some cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
feminine Artist hath been employed
to lay the beautiful Colours upon it. So
we find <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had his <hi>Helena.
Carpocrates</hi> his <hi>Marcellina. Montanus</hi> his
<hi>Priscilla</hi> and <hi>Maximilla.</hi> And the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Colours of Holiness, Zeal and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
artificially laid upon the face of
Error, how wrinkled and ugly soever in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54465:99"/>
it self, sets it off temptingly and takingly
to weak and injudicious Minds.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, Erroneous Teachers are
great Boasters: they usually give out
to the World what extraordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
they meet with in their way, which
proves a strong temptation to young
Converts, who have been so lately in the
depths of spiritual Trouble, to try at
least, if not to embrace it, for the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Comforts sake.</p>
                  <p>Ah, how many pious Ministers in
<hi>England,</hi> upon such Grounds and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
as these, have had their spiritual
Children rent from them as soon as born!
they have travailed as in birth for them;
and no sooner did they begin to take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in the success of their Labours, but
to the great grief and discouragement of
their hearts, they have been this way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved
of them. those that have owned
them as their spiritual Fathers one month,
would scarce vouchsafe to own them,
when they have met them in the Streets
another month. Many sad Instances
I could give of this, and some as remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as they are fresh and recent: but I
silence particulars. Oh see the advantage
Satan and his Instruments gain by nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such a critical Season as this is.</p>

                     <p>First, It is not safe to try, nor upon

doth not usually bless those ways to mens
comfort and edification, into which they
turn aside from that good way wherein
they first met with Christ and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.

                     <p>Secondly, 'Tis a manifest Snare of the

Your hearts are now warm with God,
Satan labours this way to cool and quench
them: the cunning Cheat labours to steal
away the sweet and nutritive Food
which is before you, and lay the hard
and dry Bones of barren Controversies

business is not to frame <hi>Syllogisms,</hi> or

                  <p>There is yet another Artifice of false
Teachers to draw Men into Errors, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54465:101"/>
that is, by pressing the Consciences of those
they have made some impressions upon,
unto all <hi>HASTE</hi> and <hi>SPEED,</hi>
openly to declare their new Opinions,
and avow and own them before the
World; as knowing that this will rivet
and fix them to all intents and purposes.</p>
                  <p>When they find Men under half Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions,
and strong inclinations to their
way, they are sure then to ply them
with a thick succession of Motives and
Arguments, to joyn themselves by a free
and open profession, to that erroneous
Party which are headed by themselves.</p>
                  <p>And the Arguments usually pressed to
this purpose are,
<list>
                        <item>1. The danger of delay.</item>
                        <item>2. The comfort of declaring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> They press them with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the least delay, by telling them,
That now they must live every day and
hour in known sin, and hold the truth of
God in unrighteousness, the evil where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they skilfully aggravate; and the
more tender and sensible the Conscience
is, the deeper impressions such discourses
make, although the Case, indeed, will
not bear the weight they lay upon it, as
having not that due allowance God
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54465:101"/>
gives of time and means of full infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in matters of this nature; yea,
possibly driving them into as great a
snare by precipitation, and too hasty
engagements under a Doubting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> They press them to a quick
resolution, with the expectations of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of comfort, inward peace and
joy, which will result from a full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
of themselves, and open decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of their Judgment; proseliting
to a Party, being the main design they
drive at.</p>
                  <p>This was the very Art and Method by
which Satan prevailed with <hi>Eve</hi> to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the bait, <hi>Gen. 3. 5. For God doth
know, that in the day ye eat thereof, then
your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as
Gods, knowing good and evil. q. d.</hi> The
sooner thou tastest, the better; for the
first taste will give thee a God-like know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
and marvellous advancement of thy
understanding; Didst thou but know the
benefit that would accrue to thee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
thou would'st not delay one moment.
And thus by setting before her the spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and immediate benefits of eating, he
prevailed, and drew her into the fatal
snare.</p>

                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:54465:102"/>
In this the Ministers of Satan imitate
the Ministers of Christ: As these press
Men to make haste to Christ, lest by
consulting with flesh and blood, and
listening to the temptations of Satan,
hopeful inclinations should be blasted in
the bud; so the others push Men on to
hasty resolutions, lest by hearkening to
the voice of God's Spirit and their own
Consciences, the design they have so far
advanced should be lost and disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The Ministers of Christ urge Men
to a speedy change of their Company,
and to associate themselves with spiritual
and profitable Christians, as well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of what great use this will be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
and strengthen them in the ways of
God. So Errorists in like manner vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
urge them to associate with their
Party, as knowing how one wedges in
and fixes another in the ways of Error;
for such Causes Satan pushes on half-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
into hasty resolutions, quick dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
being his great advantage. This
the Apostle intimates, <hi>Gal. 1. 6. I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi>

                     </gap>, what so soon!
yes, if it had not been so soon, it might
never have been at all; for <hi>Errors</hi> (as

how soon will the flock go astray? <hi>Moses</hi>

mislead a whole flock. A Minister's
work is not only to feed, but to defend
the flock. I am set (saith <hi>Paul</hi>) for the
defence of the Gospel, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 17. An
Orthodox and Faithful Minister, is a

to that people, whose Ministers, instead

cause them to err, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. 16. they are
the Dogs of the Flock. Some in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

break forth again, and clear up the day.
Thus it hath been, and thus it will be

it shall be light; then light and love shall
get the ascendant of error and divisions.
Most of our scuffles and contentions are
for want of greater measures of both

the true Grounds and Reasons of
those frequent Persecutions which God
lets in upon his Churches and People:
These rank Weeds call for Snowy and
Frosty Weather to subdue and kill
them.</p>
                     <p>I know the enemies of God's People
aim at something else: They strike at
Profession, yea, at Religion it self; and
according to their wicked intention,
without timely Repentance, will their
reward be. But whatever the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Agents be, the issues of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
are upon this account greatly
beneficial to the Church; the Wisdom
of God makes them excellently useful,
both to prevent and cure the mischiefs
and dangers of Errors. If Enemies
were not, Friends and Brethren would
be injurious to each other. Persecution,
if it kills not, yet at least it gives check
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54465:107"/>
to the rise and growth of Errors: And
if it do not perfectly redintigrate and
unite the hearts of Christians, yet to be
sure it cools and allays their sinful heats;
and that two ways: (1.) By cutting out
for them far better and more necessary
work. Now, instead of racking their
Brains about unnecessary Controversies,
they find it high time to be searching
their hearts, and examining the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their Faith and Hope, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the other World. (2.) More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
such times and straights, discover
the Sincerity, Zeal and Constancy of
them we were jealous of, or prejudiced
against before, because they followed
not us.</p>

Forbearance; We have all our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
and errors one way or other, and
therefore must maintain mutual Charity
under dissents in judgment.</p>
                     <p>I do not say, but an erring Brother
must be reduced if possible, and that
by sharp rebukes too, if gentler essays
be ineffectual, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 13. and the wounds
of a Friend have more faithful love in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54465:107"/>
them, than the kisses of an Enemy: And
if God make us instrumental by that or
any other method, to recover a Brother
from the error of his way, he will have
great cause, both to bless God, and thank
the Instrument, who thereby saves a

that are none, nor stretch every innocent
expression to that purpose; nor yet be

               <p>NEXT to the not deserving a
Reproof, is the due reception
and improvement of it. You
deserve a sharper reprehension for your
timerity and obstinacy, than I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to give you from the <hi>Press.</hi> Yet in
love to the Truth, and your own Soul,
reprove you I must, and I hope God will
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54465:109"/>
enable me to be both mild in the manner,
and convincingly clear in the matter and
cause thereof. 'Tis better to lose the
<hi>Smiles,</hi> than the <hi>Souls</hi> of men. I dare
not neglect the duty of a Friend, for fear
of incurring the suspicion of an Enemy.
Several Learned and Eminent Divines
who have seen what hath publickly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
betwixt you and me, have returned
me their thanks, and think you ought to
thank me too for the pains I have taken
to set you right, hoping you will evidence
your self-denial and repentance by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
retractation of your Errors.</p>
               <p>But how will you deceive their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations,
and unbecome the Character gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you by your Friends, when they shall
find the true measure both of your ability
and humility drawn by your own Pen in
the following Rejoinder?</p>
               <p>I have throughly considered your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
in the Manuscript you sent me, which
I hear is now in the <hi>Press;</hi> and in the
following Sheets have given a full, and
(I think) a final Answer to whatsoever
is material therein. And it so falling out,
that my Discourse of <hi>Errors</hi> was just go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the <hi>Press,</hi> whilst your Rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was there also, I thought it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to delay my Reply any longer,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54465:109"/>
but to have my Antidote in as great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
as might be to meet it.</p>
               <p>One Inconvenience I easily foresee,
that the Pages of your Manuscript, which
I follow, may not throughout exactly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to the Print: But every intelligent
Reader will easily discern and rectify
That, if my Bookseller save him not
that trouble, as I have desired him to
do.</p>
               <p>As to the Controversy about the Right
of Believers Infant-seed to <hi>Baptism,</hi> you
have altogether adventured it the second
time with the consent of your Partizans,
upon the three <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> which (if I
mistake not) I have fully confuted and
baffled in my first Answer. But if my
brevity occasioned any obscurity in that,
I hope you shall find it sufficiently done
here. Mean time you have given, and
I accordingly take it for granted, that
our Arguments for <hi>Infants Baptism</hi> stand
in their full strength against you, 'till
you can better discharge and free your
dangerous Assertions from the Errors
and Absurdities in which they are now
more involved and intricated than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

OR, A
REFUTATION
OF THE
Weak and Impertinent Rejoinder
OF
Mr. PHILIP CARY:</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein he vainly attempts the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of his Absurd Thesis, to the
great abuse and injury of the Laws
and Covenants of God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AND must I be dipt once more
in the Water-Controversy? 'tis
time for me to think of undres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
my self, and making ready for my
approaching Rest, and employ those
few moments I have to spend, in more
Practical and Beneficial Studies, for my
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54465:111"/>
own, and the Churches greater advantage.
And 'tis time for Mr. <hi>C.</hi> to reflect upon his
past Follies, which have consumed too
much of his own, and others time,
without any advantage; yea, to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
loss and injury of the Cause he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
to defend.</p>
               <p>When I received these Sheets from him,
in vindication of his <hi>Solemn Call,</hi> I was
at a stand in my own Resolutions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to let it pass (without any Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
upon it) as a passionate Clamor
for a desperate Cause; or give a short
and full Answer to his confused and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
Rejoinder. But considering
that I had under hand at the same time
the foregoing <hi>Treatise</hi> of <hi>the Causes and
Cures of Mental Errors;</hi> and that though
my honest Neighbour discovers much
weakness in his way of Argumentation,
yet it was like to meet with some intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
Readers, to whom, for that reason,
it would be the more suitable; and how
apt such Persons are to glory in the last
word; but especially considering that a
little time and pains would suffice (as
the Case stands) to end the unseasonable
Controversy betwixt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> us, and both clear
and confirm many great and weighty
Points of Religion: I was upon these
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54465:111"/>
Considerations prevailed with, against
my own Inclination, to cast in these few
Sheets as a <hi>Mantissa</hi> to the former seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and necessary Discourse of <hi>Errors,</hi>
resolving to fill them with what should
be worth the Reader's time and pains.</p>
               <p>As for the rude Insults, uncomely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
and passionate Expressions of
my discontented Friend, I shall not
throw back the dirt upon him, when I
wipe it off from my self: I can easily
forgive and forget them too. The best
men have their Passions, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 17.
even <hi>Sweet-briers</hi> and <hi>Holy-Thistles</hi> have
their offensive Prickles. I consider my
honest Neighbour under the strength of
a Temptation. It disquiets him to see
the Labours of many years, and the
raised Expectations of so great a conquest
and triumph over men of Renown, all
frustrated by his Friend and Neighbour,
who had done his utmost to prevent it;
and often foretold him of the folly and
vanity of his Attempt. Every thing will
live as long as it can, and <hi>natura vexat a
prodit seipsam.</hi> But certainly it had been
more for Truth's honour, and Mr. <hi>C</hi>'s
comfort, to have confessed his Follies
humbly to God, and have laid his hand
upon his mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:54465:112"/>
The things in controversy betwixt us,
are great and weighty, <hi>viz.</hi> The true
nature of the <hi>Sinai Laws,</hi> in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
body; the quality of God's <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
with <hi>Abraham;</hi> and the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the New <hi>Covenant</hi> we are now
under. These are things of great weight
in themselves; and their due Resolutions
are at this time somewhat the more
weighty, because my <hi>Antagonist</hi> hath
adventured the whole Controversy of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
Baptism upon them.</p>
               <p>I have in my <hi>Vindiciae Legis, &amp;c.</hi> sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the several Questions clearly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly.
Shewn Mr. <hi>C.</hi> what is no part
of the Controversy, and what is the
very hinge upon which it turns; desired
him, if he made any Reply, to keep close
to the just and necessary Rules of Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
by distinguishing, limiting, or
denying any of my Propositions; that
the matters in Controversy might be put
to a fair and speedy issue. But instead of
that, I meet with a flood of words rolling
sometimes to this part, and then to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of my Answer, and so back
again, without the steddy direction of
Art or Reason. There may, for ought I
know, be some things of weight in
Mr. <hi>Cary</hi>'s Reply, if a man could fee
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54465:112"/>
them for words: but without scoff or
vanity I must say of the rational part of
it, as the <hi>Poet</hi> said of the overdressed
Woman,—<hi>Pars minima est ipsa Puella sui,</hi>
'tis the least part of it. To follow him
in his irregular and extravagant way of
writing, were to make my self guilty of
the same folly I blame him for. I am
therefore necessitated to perstringe them,
and reduce all I have to say, under three
general Heads.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. I shall clearly evince to the World,
That Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> hath not been able to
discharge and free his own <hi>Theses</hi>
from the horrid Consequents, and
gross Absurdities which I laid to
their charge in my first Reply; but
instead thereof, in this feeble and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successful
attempt to free the former,
he hath entangled himself in more
and greater ones.</item>
                  <item>II. That he hath left my <hi>Arguments</hi>
standing in their full strength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him.</item>
                  <item>III. And then I shall confirm and
strengthen my three <hi>Positions,</hi>
which destroy the Cause he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages,
by some further Additions
of Scripture, Reason and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54465:113"/>
which I hope will fully end
this matter betwixt us.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But before I touch the Particulars, two
things must be premised for the Reader's
due information.</p>
               <p>1. That the Controversie about the
true nature of the <hi>Sinai Laws,</hi> both Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and Ceremonial, complexly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
is not that very Hinge upon which
the Right of Believers Infants to Baptism
depends: that stands as it did before, be
the <hi>Sinai Laws</hi> what they will. We do
not derive the Right of Infants from any
other Law or Covenant, but that graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Covenant which God made with
<hi>Abraham,</hi> which was in being 430 years
before <hi>Moses</hi> his Law;<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 17.</note> and was no way
injured, much less disannulled, by the
addition of it. If <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant
be the same Covenant of Grace we are
now under, the Right of Believers In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
to Baptism, is secured, whatever the
<hi>Sinai</hi> Convenant prove to be. Which I
speak not out of the least jealousie that
Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> hath, or ever shall be able to
prove it to be a pure <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant
of Works; but to prevent Mistakes in
the Reader.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:54465:113"/>
2. It must be heedfully observed also,
that how free, gracious and absolute soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the New Covenant be, (for God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
that I should go about to eclipse the
glory of Free-grace on which my Soul
depends for Salvation) yet that will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
prove <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant to be an
abolished <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant of Works,
unless two things more be proved, which
I never expect to see, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his believing
Posterity, were bound by the very nature
and act of Circumcision to keep the
whole Law in their own persons in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to their Justification and Salvation,
as perfectly and perpetually, and under
the same penalty for the least failure, as
<hi>Adam</hi> was to keep the Law in <hi>Paradise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It must be further proved,
That <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all his believing Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring,
who stood with him under that
Covenant, whereof Circumcision was
the initiating Sign, were all saved in a
different way from that in which Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
are now saved under the Gospel:
for so it must be, if the addition of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
made it unto them an <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Covenant of Works. But this would be
a direct contradiction to the words of the
<hi>Apostle,</hi> speaking of them who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54465:114"/>
the Covenant of Circumcision, <hi>Acts
15. 11. But we believe, that through the
grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, we shall be
saved even as they.</hi> If he say, they stood
indeed under that Covenant, as a pure
Covenant of Works, but were saved by
another Covenant; and so for many Ages
the Church of God stood absolutely under
the Covenant of Works, and at the same
time under the pure Covenant of Grace;
the one altogether absolute and free, the
other wholly conditional: and though
these two be in their own natures incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
and destructive of each other, yet
so it was, that all the Saints for many
Ages were absolutely under the one, and
yet purely under the other: shall I be
then censured for saying he speaks pure
contradiction?</p>
               <p>Possibly my Reader will be tempted to
think I abuse him, and that no man of
common sense can be guilty of such an
horrid Absurdity. I must, whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
I have for Mr. <hi>C.</hi> once more tell
him before the World, that this is not
only his own Doctrine, but that very
Doctrine upon which he hath adventured
the whole Cause and Controversie of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
Baptism, which I therefore say is
hereby become a desperate Cause.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:54465:114"/>
And this brings me to my first general
Head, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. <hi>First,</hi> That Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> hath not been
able to free his Thesis from this borrid ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity;
but by strugling to do it, hath
(according to the nature of Errors) entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himself in more and greater ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Cary, <hi>in</hi> p. 174, 175. <hi>of his</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Call, <hi>was by me reduced to this Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity,
which he there owns in express
words,</hi> 
                  <q>That <hi>Moses,</hi> and the whole body
of the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> were absolutely
under (without the exception of any) the
severest penalties of a dreadful Curse;
and that the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant could be no
other than a Covenant of Works, a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of death and condemnation;
and yet at the same time, both <hi>Moses,</hi>
and all the Elect, were under a pure Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Gospel-grace: And if these were
two contrary Covenants in themselves,
and just opposite the one to the other, as
indeed they were, we have nothing to say,
but with the Apostle, <hi>O the depth,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This, Reader, is the Position which
must be made good by Mr. <hi>Cary,</hi> or his
Cause is lost. Deformed Issues do not
look as if they had beautiful Truth for
their Mother. No false or absurd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54465:115"/>
can regularly follow from true
Premisses: But hence naturally and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
follows this</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Absurdity I.</head>
                  <p>That <hi>Abraham, Moses,</hi> and all the
Believers under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> by
standing absolutely under <hi>Adam</hi>'s Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works, as a ministration of
death and condemnation; and at the
same time purely under the Covenant of
Grace (as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> affirms they did) must
necessarily, during their lives, hang mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
betwixt Life and Death, Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Condemnation; and after death,
midway betwixt Heaven and Hell. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
life, they could neither be justified nor
condemned. Justified they could not be,
for Justification is the Soul's passing from
death to life, 1 <hi>Iohn 3. 14. Iohn</hi> 5. 24.
Upon a man's justification his Covenant
and State are changed; but the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and State of no man can be so
changed as long as he remains absolutely
under the severest Penalties and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Law, as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> affirms
they did.</p>
                  <p>Again, Condemned they could not
be, seeing all that are under the pure Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace (as he saith they were
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54465:115"/>
at the same time) are certainly in Christ;
and to such there is no condemnation,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. nor ever shall be: <hi>Ioh. 5. 24.
He that believeth, shall not come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
but is passed from death unto
life.</hi> What remains then, but that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
life, they could neither be perfectly
justified, nor perfectly condemned; and
yet being absolutely under the severest
Penalties of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant, they were
perfectly condemned; and again, being
under the pure Covenant of Grace, they
must be perfectly justified?</p>
                  <p>And then after death, they must nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
go to Heaven, nor Hell; but either
be annihilated, or stick mid-way in <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo
Patrum</hi> (as the <hi>Papists</hi> fancy) betwixt
both. No condemned Person goes to
Heaven, nor any justified Person to Hell.
His <hi>Position</hi> therefore, which necessarily
infers this gross Absurdity, is justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
and detested by Learned and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Divines.</p>

<q>The <hi>Israelites</hi> (saith he) with whom

                        <hi>Mr.</hi> Strong <hi>on the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> p. 66, 67.</note> gives four irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
Arguments to prove, that no man
can stand under both these Covenants at
the same time, which in co-ordination
actually destroy and make void each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<q>If the First Covenant stand,
there is no place for the Second; and
if the Second stand, the first is made
void. And this (saith he) will fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
if we consider the direct contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the terms of those two Covenants.
For (1.) the Righteousness of the
first Covenant is in our selves; but the
Righteousness of the Second is the
Righteousness of another, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 11.
12. (2.) In the Covenant of Works,
acceptation is first of the Works, and
afterwards of the Person; <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7.
but in the Covenant of Grace, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation

is first of the Person, and
then of the Work, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 4. (3.) The
First Covenant was a Covenant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a <hi>Priest,</hi> but the Second is a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with a <hi>Priest.</hi> (4.) In the First
Covenant there is matter of glorying,

3. 27. So that these two can never

reconcile these four Opposites in the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
of the same Person.</q>

                     <q>That
the same pretended Absurdities do fall as
heavily, and a great deal more, on our
Doctrine, who affirm the <hi>Sinai</hi> Law (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexly

or Grace, than upon his who makes them
two essentially different Covenants: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are forced to comprize perfect
doing, with the curse for non-performance,
under the same Covenant with believing:
and that it cannot be denied but that all

                     <hi>This is the sum
and substance of his first Answer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will not be tempted to expose my
Neighbour to derision for this his strange
Answer;<note place="margin">Reply.</note> but rather propound two sober
<hi>Queries</hi> to him, and the Reader, <hi>viz.</hi>
(1.) What Orthodox Divines he ever
met with, and what are their names,
who are forced to comprize perfect do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
with the curse for non-performance,
under the same Covenant with believing:
and so make the two opposite Covenants
to be specifically one and the same? Name
your Men, with their Books and Pages;
or retract with shame and sorrow what
you have here abusively affirmed of them.
<hi>Cameron</hi> indeed makes it a subservient
Covenant; the most a true, though ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
Covenant of Grace; but none com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant with its Curse, in
the New Covenant. (2.) Whether it be
imaginable, That the same Absurdity can
follow from their Doctrine, that make the
whole complex body of the <hi>Sinai Law</hi> a
Covenant of Grace, though more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure,
and so place all the People of God
in those Ages under it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as does necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
follow his Doctrine, who makes it a
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54465:118"/>
pure <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant of Works, and
places the Church of God absolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the curse of it, and also under the
pure Covenant of Grace at the same
time? If Grace and Grace (how diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
soever in degrees of manifestation)
be as opposite and repugnant, as Grace
and Works, as Justification and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
are, 'tis time for me to lay down
my Pen; for I have certainly lost my
Understanding to guide it any further.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> will say, If you do not,
yet Mr. <hi>Roberts</hi> doth comprize both in
one Covenant. I say, you abuse Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi>
in so affirming: for he saith in that
very place you refer to<note n="*" place="margin">Roberts <hi>on the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> pag. 775, 776, 777.</note>, That believing
in Christ was ultimately and chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
doing was only urged upon <hi>Israel</hi> in
subordination and tendency to that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.
And upon that ground it is he
affirms that Covenant to be a Covenant
of Faith, and so denominates it from the
chief scope and intent of it. He sets not
<hi>doing</hi> and <hi>believing</hi> in co-ordination, or
places the Church under two opposite
Covenants, as you do; but places the
Law, where it ought to be placed, in
subordination to Faith and Christ. And
therefore you have abused that good Man,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54465:118"/>
as well as me, and your self most of all
in this your first impertinent and silly
Answer.</p>
                  <p>(2.) But you have one Evasion more,
<hi>p.</hi> 7. where you say, <q>
                        <hi>That how harsh
and dreadful soever the Terms or Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Legal Covenant were to those
that were under it, as</hi> Moses, <hi>and the
whole body of the</hi> Israelites, <hi>then were;
yet the grace of the Gospel-Covenant far
superseded, and was by far more victorious,
powerful, and efficacious,</hi> Rom. 5. 17,
20.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Worse and worse.<note place="margin">Reply.</note> Your Discourse
mends like sower <hi>Ale</hi> in <hi>Summer.</hi> Here
you fancy the two Covenants (under
which you place the whole Church of
God) to be in a conflict one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
Condemnation and Justification
strugling one with another, as I told
you before they would: but however,
the Grace of the New Covenant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
at last, and gets the victory over the
Covenant of Works. Very good; but
then pray, Sir, if you please, answer me
a plain Question or two at your leisure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> How far did the Covenant of
Grace prevail against the Covenant of
Works? Was it so far prevalent and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
as utterly to vanquish and disannul
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54465:119"/>
it, as a Covenant of Works to them?
or was it not? Was the Victory you
speak of, a compleat, or a partial one?
If you say it was incompleat and partial,
then you leave them (as I told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you must) partly under the Promise,
and partly under the Curse; justified in
part, and condemned in part. But if
you say, it was a compleat and perfect
Victory, then it utterly dissolved its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
as a Covenant of Works; then
they did not remain under two opposite
Covenants, as you affirmed they did;
but on their believing, changed their state
with their Covenant, as we affirm they
did.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If you say, it did not totally
free them from the Curse of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works, but however prevailed
so far that they were not actually damned
by vertue of the Curse; then be pleased
to answer me one Question more, <hi>How
it was possi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>le for them to be absolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Curse of the Law (as you affirmed
they were) and yet that Curse to be so su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perseded
by the Covenant of Grace, as here
you speak?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To supersede the Curse</hi> (though it be a
Phrase I never met with before) if it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
any thing, it must signify this; That
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54465:119"/>
the Covenant of Grace caused the Law
to omit, forbear, or give over to curse
that People any more. But did, or can
the Law forbear or cease to curse those
that are absolutely under it as a ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of death and condemnation? Pray
consult, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10.
Are you aware what you say, when you
place Believers absolutely under the
Curse of the Law, and then talk of the
New Covenant's victory over it; and
after all this, leave them as you do, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
under the cursing power of the
one; and still under the victorious grace
of the other? For shame, my Friend,
give up your absurd notion, and repent
of this folly. I would not willingly
shame you before the World; I did all
that lay in me to prevent it. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<hi>Pudor est medicina pudoris,</hi> the only
way you have left me to prevent your
glorying in your shame, is this way, to
make you ashamed of your vain-glory.
As for that Scripture you alledge to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
your fancy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17, 20. you
might to as good purpose have opened
your Bible, and have taken the first Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
that came to hand, and it would
have done your <hi>Position</hi> less harm. For
the Apostle's scope there, is to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54465:120"/>
the perfection of the abounding
Righteousness of Christ, for the full dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of Believers from the guilt of sin,
and curse of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant; and cuts
the throat of your <hi>Position,</hi> which it is
alledged to prove.</p>
                  <p>I have stood the longer upon the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this first Point; because this being
fully cleared, it runs through and clears
the whole Controversy betwixt us. For
now it will be evident to all, That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s, nor <hi>Moses</hi> his Covenant
(complexly taken, as Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> takes it)
could possibly be for this reason, an
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant of Works; and if not
a Covenant of Works, then how dark
or legal soever the Dispensations of them
were, they must needs be the same Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace, for substance, under
which we are, and so the main Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy
betwixt us is hereby at an end.</p>
                  <p>I know not how many Covenants of
Works, or how many of Grace, Mr. <hi>C.</hi>
fancies there are; But Orthodox Divines
constantly affirm<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Vid.</hi> Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton<hi>'s Bounds,</hi> p. 148.</note>, That as there never
were but two ways of Life to mankind,
the one before the Fall, by perfect do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the other after the Fall, by sincere
believing: So answerably there can be
but two Covenants betwixt God and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54465:120"/>
Mankind, <hi>viz.</hi> the Covenant of Works,
and the Covenant of Grace. The last of
which hath, indeed, been more obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Administred, and in that respect is
called the Old Covenant; yet that and
the New are essentially but one Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:
And the Church of God, which
for many Ages stood under that Old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
did not stand under it as an
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant, or the First Covenant
of works, for the undeniable Reasons
above given. And therefor <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
Covenant, from whence we derive our
Childrens Title to Baptism, must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
be the very same Covenant for
substance with this New Covenant,
which all <hi>Abraham</hi>'s believing off-spring,
and their Infant-seed are now under.
And in proving this one point, I have
sufficiently confuted both Mr. <hi>C</hi>'s <hi>Solemn
Call,</hi> and this his feeble vindication of it,
together.</p>
                  <p>But lest he should take this for the
only Absurdity proved upon him, tho'
it be tiresome to me, and must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
to him; give me leave to touch
one more among many; and that the
rather, because I make great use of it in
this Controversy, and Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> both
yields and denies it. If his own words
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54465:121"/>
be the Messengers of his meaning, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he, or I, must mistake their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand.</p>
                  <p>I had in my <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> distinguished
of the Law, as strictly taken for the <hi>Ten
Commandments;</hi> and more largely and
complexly taken, as including the <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial</hi>
Law. The former I considered
according to God's intention and design
in the prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

add it as an <hi>Appendix</hi> to the Promise,

Rom.</hi> 10. 3. I told him, That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
depended upon this double sense
of the Law, for that it ought not to
be denominated from the abused and
mistaken End of it; but from God's chief
scope and design in the promulgation of
it, which was to add it as an <hi>Appendix</hi>
to the Promise, as the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> How the <hi>Iews</hi> were <hi>right
enough</hi> in reference to the true nature of
the Law, as it was a Covenant of Works,
and yet <hi>out</hi> in respect of its proper use
and intention, which was not, that any
should attain unto Life and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54465:122"/>
by it, but to convince them of Sin,
and of the necessity of a Saviour; and
yet the Law be a Covenant of Works, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally,</hi>
as well as <hi>materially</hi> consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and that in respect of God's special
designation and appointment? If God
designed and appointed it in his <hi>Sinai</hi>
dispensation, to be to them an <hi>Adam</hi>'s Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Works, then certainly they
were not out (as you say they were)
when they sought Righteousness by the
works of it; nor could that mistake of
theirs be the ground of the Controversy
betwixt the <hi>Apostle</hi> and them: For it
seems it was no mistake, being by God's
intention, as well as its own primitive
nature, promulged at <hi>Sinai,</hi> as a true

                  <p>

                     </note> and ask me why it
might not be added to the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to re-inforce that? I answer, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the scope of the place will not bear
it, nor any good Expositor countenance
such a fancy. You make the <hi>Sinai</hi> Law
to be the same with that first Covenant,
and by so expounding the Apostle, you
make him say, either that the same thing
was added to it self, (which must in
your own Phrase, be by a <hi>Correspondency
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54465:123"/>
of Identity</hi>) or else that there are two
distinct Covenants of Works (when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
there is but one) and that the latter
was added to the former. This is your
way of Expounding Scripture, when
driven to a streight by dint of Argument.
Nothing beside such a pure necessity,
could drive you upon such an Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
                  <p>It was added to the promise (saith Dr.
<hi>Reynolds</hi>) by way of subserviency and
attendance,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Dr.</hi> Reynolds, <hi>Use of the Law,</hi> p. 378. <hi>full up to my sense, and</hi> p. 371.</note> the better to advance and
make effectual the Covenant it self.
Mr. <hi>Strong</hi> upon the two Covenants,
saith, the Apostle's meaning is, that
the Law was added as an <hi>Appendix</hi> to
the Promise. But it may be you had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hear Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Exposition<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Dr.</hi> Crisp, Lib. 4. <hi>Serm.</hi> 9.</note> than
his; for you say, had it been added to
the Promise, it would have given life.
The <hi>Doctor</hi> will at once give you the
true sense of the Text, and with it a full
answer to your Objection. <q>
                        <hi>Though
Life</hi> (saith he) <hi>be not the end of the
Law, yet there are other sufficient uses of
it requiring the promulgation thereof:
It was published to be an Appendix to
the Gospel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

the Promise of Life by Christ, above the
Law.</hi> (3.) <hi>The Consistence of the Law

that the <hi>Iews</hi> did mistake its chief scope

40, 41, 46. whence I plainly proved,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54465:124"/>
That there is a Promise of Pardon found
in the <hi>Sinai</hi> dispensation, to penitent
sinners. That this Promise was given
at <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> by the hand of <hi>Moses,</hi> is
undeniable from <hi>vers.</hi> 46. That it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Relief of a gracious remission
to penitent sinners, is as undeniable from
<hi>vers.</hi> 40, 41. If you say, this Promise
belongs to <hi>Moses</hi> his dispensation (as
<hi>verse</hi> 46. tells you it did) then there is
remission of Sins found in the <hi>Sinai</hi> Laws.
If you say, it only refers to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
Covenant of Grace; then that Covenant
of Grace appears to be conditional, which
you utterly deny.</p>
                  <p>Now what is your Reply to this?
(1.) You object my own words in <hi>the

never read the just and fair Vindication
I had before given you of them, <hi>p.</hi> 134,

rate Men may continue Controversies to
the Worlds end. Sir, there are many
Witnesses, that you are very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with my <hi>Method of Grace.</hi>
(2.) You say, <hi>p.</hi> 31. of your Reply,
That that Covenant could not be condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
<hi>because a Condition implies merit
either of congruity or condignity.</hi> This is

But that Point belonging to
the last Head of Controversy between us,
I shall refer it thither.</p>
                  <p>It were easie for me to instance in
many more Absurdities which Mr. <hi>C.</hi>
cannot eluctate, and to prove them upon
him as easily as to name them. But I
will not press him too far; what hath
been named and proved already, is more
than enough to convince the Reader,
that my first Argument is left standing

                  <p>My next <hi>Argument, Vindiciae, &amp;c.
p.</hi> 27. is as secure as the first. It was this.
If <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant had one end, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Happiness and Justification of
Men by their own Obedience, and the
Law at <hi>Sinai</hi> had quite another end,
namely to bring Sinners to Christ by
Faith for their Righteousness; the one
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54465:125"/>
to keep him within himself, the other to
take him quite out of himself; then the
<hi>Sinai</hi> Law cannot possibly be the same
with <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant of Works in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But so stands the Case, <hi>Rom. 10. 4.
Christ is the end of the Law for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to every one that believeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore they cannot be the same,
but two different Covenants.</p>
                  <p>All that touches this <hi>Argument,</hi> is but
three Lines in the 49th page of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply;
where you say you have sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answered and cleared this in <hi>p.</hi> 169,
172. of your former Discourse, from the
corrupt interpretation by me fastened
thereon.</p>
                  <p>Now, if the Reader will give himself
the trouble to examine those Pages, he
shall find that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> there allows that
very interpretation which he here calls

If Christ himself were the <hi>Angel</hi> by

such a Covenant directly opposite to all

                  <p>The last <hi>Argument</hi> I urged, was from

                  <p>No such Covenant as by the Fall had
utterly lost all its Promises, Privileges,
and Blessings, and could retain nothing
but Curses and Punishments, could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
be numbred among the chief Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
in which God's <hi>Israel</hi> gloried.</p>
                  <p>But the Law given at <hi>Sinai</hi> was num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
among their chief privileges, <hi>Rom.
9. 4. Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this he only saith, <hi>p.</hi> 57. of his
Reply, <q>That the Law, even as it was
a Covenant of Works, was a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
inestimable, beyond what all others
enjoyed; because the very Curses and
Punishments annexed thereunto, in
case of the least faileur, were of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
use to convince them of their
sin and misery without Christ, and
their necessity therefore of a Saviour;
which was the proper work of the
Law, as a Covenant of works; which
advantage all other Nations wanting,
it might well be numbred among the
chief Privileges they were invested
with.</q>

But (1.) If the Law were intended
by God, to be an <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant to
them (as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> saith it was) where
then is the Privilege of God's <hi>Israel</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
other Nations? (2.) If their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
consisted in the subserviency of
that Law to Christ (as he here intimates
it did) then he yields the thing I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for. For this being its chief scope
and end, we do hence justly denominate
it a Covenant of Grace, though more
obscure and legally administred. And
in this judgment most of our solid Divines
concur. Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> on the <hi>Attributes,
p.</hi> 390. is clear and judicious in the
point.<note place="margin">Bolton<hi>'s</hi> Bounds, <hi>p.</hi> 130, &amp;c.</note> Mr. <hi>Samuel Bolton,</hi> in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Book called, <hi>The Bounds of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

as a Covenant of Works.<note place="margin">Burgess, de Lege, <hi>p.</hi> 225. Greenhill, in Loc.</note> Mr. <hi>Anth.

<hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. gives us demonstration from
that Context, That since it was a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Covenant,
as it appears to be <hi>v.</hi> 8.
it cannot possibly be a distinct Covenant
from the Covenant of Grace. The incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable

states this Controversy;<note place="margin">Turret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, <hi>part 2. p.</hi> 288, 289.</note> and both
positively asserts, and by many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54465:127"/>
fully proves, That the <hi>Sinai</hi> Law
cannot be a pure Covenant of Works, or
a Covenant specifically distinct from the
Covenant of Grace. It were easie to
fill Pages with Allegations of this kind;
but I hope what hath been said, may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for this Point.</p>
                  <p>But still Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> complains, that I
have all this while but threatned his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi>
to prove them fallacious, or to
have four Terms in them; and therefore
he hath drawn out some select <hi>Arguments,</hi>
as he calls them, <hi>p.</hi> 37. to try my skill
upon. I will neither tire my Reader in
a foolish chase of such weak and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
<hi>Arguments</hi> as he there produceth,
nor yet wholly neglect them, lest he
glory in them as unanswerable. And
therefore to shew him the fate of the rest,
I will only touch his first Argument,
which being his <hi>Argumentum Palmarium,</hi>
deservedly leads the Van to all the rest.
And thus it runs upon all four.</p>
                  <p>That Covenant that is not of Faith,
must needs be a Covenant of Works,
yea, the very same for substance with
that made with <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Scripture is express, That the
<hi>Law</hi> is not of Faith, <hi>Gal. 3. 12. Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>

The <hi>Law</hi> is considered two ways in
Scripture.<note place="margin">Reply.</note> (1.) Largely, for the whole

the Ceremonial as well as Moral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts;
and that Law is of Faith, as the

it required that God
be worshipped, which he

Faith. And because <hi>Paul</hi>
describes the Righteousness
of Faith in those very words whereby
<hi>Moses</hi> had declared the Precepts of the
Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 11, 12, 13. Again, the
Law in Scripture is taken <hi>strictly</hi> for the
<hi>Moral Law</hi> only, considered abstractly
from the promises of Grace, as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
<hi>Iusticiaries</hi> understood it. These are
two far different senses and acceptations
of the Law. Your <hi>Major Proposition</hi>
takes the Law in its large complex body,
as appears by your <hi>3d</hi> page. Your <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
Proposition,</hi> which you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
by <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 12. takes the Law strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54465:128"/>
and abstractly, as it is set disjunctly
from, yea in opposition to Faith and the
Promises, and so there are two sorts of
<hi>Law</hi> in your <hi>Argument,</hi> and consequently
your <hi>Argument</hi> is fallacious, as all its fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
be, and <hi>runs</hi> (as I told you before)
<hi>upon all four.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I hope this may suffice with respect to
the <hi>Sinai</hi> Covenant controverted betwixt
me and my Neighbour, to evince that it
cannot be what he asserts it to be, even
an <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant of Works: and that
I have discharged what I undertook to
prove with respect to this Covenant,
namely, That Mr. <hi>C.</hi> cannot free his <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi>
from the gross Absurdities with
which I loaded it, but endeavouring to
do that, hath incurred many more: that
his <hi>Reply</hi> hath left my Arguments stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and that the <hi>Position</hi> I have set up against
him, is well founded in Scripture; and
hath the general concurrence and consent
of Learned, Holy and Orthodox Divines.</p>

                        <hi>That the Law

<hi>with no other than Evangelical and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
purposes,</hi>
                     </q> he abundantly confirms
my Sense and <hi>Arguments,</hi> and saves me
the labour of refuting the principal, and
most of yours: where carrying before
him the whole Context of <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. from
the 15th to the 23d, he clearly carries
his Doctrine with it, proving from <hi>v.</hi> 15.
<q>That God's Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi>
was perpetual and immutable, and
therefore all other subsequent Acts of
God (such as the giving of the Law
was) do some way or other refer unto
it. (2.) From <hi>v.</hi> 16.<note place="margin">P. 376.</note> he further proves,
That as God's Covenant with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
is most constant in regard of the
wisdom and unvariableness of him that
made it; so it can never expire for want
of a Seed to whom it is made.<note place="margin">P. 377.</note> (3.) From
<hi>v.</hi> 17. he proves, that if another Law
be made after the Promise, which <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
specie,</hi> and in strict construction,
doth imply a contradiction to the terms
and nature of the former Law; then it
is certain, that this latter Law must be
understood in some other sense, and
admit of some other subordinate use,
which may well consist with the being
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54465:129"/>
and force of the former Covenant.
(4.) From <hi>v.</hi> 18. he proves, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Law hath not voided the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and that the Law is not of force (as
you vainly dream) towards the Seed to
whom the Promise is made; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if it be not to stand in a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
it follows that it must stand in
subordination to the Gospel; and so to
tend to Evangelical Purposes.</q> (5.) He
further proves his Conclusion from <hi>v.</hi> 19.
which shews for what end the Law was
added, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <q>It was not (saith
he) set up alone, as a thing in gross
by it self; as an adequate, compleat,
solid Rule of Righteousness, as it was
given to <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradise:</hi> much less
was it published to void and disannul
any precedent Covenant; but so far
was it from abrogating, that it was
<hi>added to the Promise</hi> by way of subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency,
and attendance; the better to
advance and make effectual the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
it self; and that until the Seed
should come, which whether it respect
Christ personal, or mystical; in either
sense (saith he) it confirms the point
we are upon, <hi>viz. That the Law hath
Evangelical purposes.</hi> If the Seed be
understood of the Person of Christ,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54465:130"/>
then this shews that the Law was put
to the Promise, the better to raise and
stir up in men the expectations of
Christ, the promised Seed. But if we
understand by Seed, the <hi>Faithful</hi>
(which I rather approve);<note place="margin">P. 379.</note> then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle's
meaning is this; That as long
as any are either to come into the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Christ's Body, and have the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace applied to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
so long there will be use of the Law,
both to the Unregenerate, to make
them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

already called, that they may learn to
cast all their faith, hope, and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Righteousness upon him still.
This then manifestly shews,<note place="margin">P. 380.</note> that there
was no other intention in publishing
the Law, but with reference to the
Seed: that is, with Evangelical pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
to shew mercy: not with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to those that perish, who would
have had condemnation enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Law.</q> And further strengthens
his Conclusion from the last words of
<hi>vers.</hi> 19. <q>That it was ordained by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
in the hand of a <hi>Mediator.</hi> This
(saith he) evidently declares, That the
Law was published in mercy and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cification,
not in fury or revenge;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:54465:130"/>
(for the work of a <hi>Mediator</hi> is to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
peace, and treat of reconcilement
between Parties offended) whereas, if
the Lord had intended death in the
publishing of the Law, he would not
have proclaimed it in the hand of a
<hi>Mediator,</hi> but of an <hi>Executioner.</hi>
(6.) From <hi>vers.</hi> 20.<note place="margin">P. 381<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> Those words
(saith he) shew why the Law was
published in the hand of a <hi>Mediator,
viz.</hi> that they should not despair and
sink under the fear of his Wrath. For
as he made a Covenant of Promise to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed; so he is the
same <hi>God</hi> still, one in his grace and
mercy towards Sinners. <hi>God is one,
i. e.</hi> in sending this <hi>Mediator,</hi> he doth
declare to Mankind, that he is at peace
and unity with them again. <hi>Moses</hi>
was the Representative, and Christ
the substantial and real Mediator.
<hi>God is one, i. e.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">P. 382.</note> he carries the same
purpose and intention both in the Law
and in the Gospel;<note place="margin">P. 384.</note> namely, benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and desire of reconcilement with
men. (7.) To sum up all that hath
been spoken touching the use of the
Law in a plain similitude; Suppose
we a <hi>Prince</hi> should proclaim a Pardon
to all <hi>Traitors,</hi> if they would come in
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54465:131"/>
and plead it; and after this, should send
forth his Officers to attach, imprison,
examine, convince, arraign, threaten
and condemn them: is he now contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to himself? hath he repented of his
Mercy? No, but he is unwilling to
lose his Mercy, desirous to have the
honour of his Mercy acknowledged
unto him. The same is the Case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and us. To <hi>Abraham</hi> he
made a promise of Mercy and Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to all that would plead interest in it,
for the remission of their Sins; but men
were secure and heedless of their
Estate,<note place="margin">P. 385.</note> 
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hereupon the Lord pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
by <hi>Moses</hi> a severe and terrible
Law; yet in all this, God doth but
pursue his first purpose of mercy, and
take a course to make his Gospel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
worthy of all acceptation;
which clears the general point, <hi>That
God in the publication of the Law by</hi>
Moses <hi>on Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>had none but
Merciful and Evangelical Intentions.</hi>
And once more; The Law was not
published by <hi>Moses</hi> on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> as
it was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradise,</hi>

all which he saith, <hi>p.</hi> 388, 389. that

                  </p>
                  <p>Here I have abundant cause again to
complain, that Mr. <hi>C.</hi> hath so formed
his Answers, as if he had never read the
Book he undertakes a Reply to. And I
do verily believe, the greatest part of his
Reply was made at random, before ever
my printed Book was in his hands. For
he hath not at all considered the state of
the Question as I there gave it him; nor
kept himself to the just and necessary
Rules of Disputation, as I earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
he would. However, 'tis not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
but confirmation and vindication
of my Arguments, which is my proper
work. I shall therefore recite them
briefly, and vindicate and confirm them
strongly; contracting all into as few
words as can express the sense and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Point before me.</p>

I have taken a liberty to say what I please,

For those things that have thus passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

knoweth not what spirit he is of.</hi> The
Case must be tried by his own Book, and
it will quickly be decided. These are
the very words in his <hi>Solemn Call,</hi> p. 148.
<q>
                        <hi>He</hi> (that is, Mr. <hi>Sedgwick) makes no
distinction betwixt the Ceremonial Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
that was dedicated with blood, and
the Law written in stones that was not
so dedicated. How strangely doth he
confound and obscure the word and truth
of God, which ought to have been cleared
and distinctly declared to those he had
preached or written to?</hi>
                     </q> With much
more, <hi>p.</hi> 149, 150, 151. where he saith,
<q>
                        <hi>It's plain, that the Law written in Stones,
and the Book wherein the Statutes and
Iudgments were contained, were two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Covenants, and delivered at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
seasons, and in a distinct method;
the one with, the other without a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
the one dedicated with blood and
sprinkling, the other (that we read of)
not so dedicated.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let the Reader judge whether I
have deserved such Tragical Complaints
and dreadful Charges for inferring from
these words, That the Ceremonial Law
being by him pronounced a distinct Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
from the Moral Law, which he
makes all one with <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54465:133"/>
delivered at a distinct season, and in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
method; the Ceremonial Law
with a <hi>Mediator,</hi> the Moral Law without
a <hi>Mediator;</hi> the Ceremonial Law dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with blood and sprinkling, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law not so dedicated: let him judge
(I say) whether I have wronged him in
saying, that by his own confession, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
being a part of this Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Law, it can therefore be no part of
the Covenant of Works?</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> hath two things to say
for himself.<note place="margin">Exception.</note> (1.) That in the same place
he makes the Ceremonial Law no other
than <hi>a Covenant of Works:</hi> And the
wrong I have done him, is by not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
(as he did) betwixt <hi>A Covenant
of Works,</hi> and <hi>The Covenant of Works.</hi> Here
it seems lies my guilt upon which this
dreadful out-cry against me is made.</p>
                  <p>But if I should chance to prove,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> that
there never was, is, or can be any more
than one Covenant of Works; and that
any other Covenant which is distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from it (as he confesses the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Law was) by a Mediator, and the
blood of sprinkling, can be no part of
that Covenant of Works: what then
will become of Mr. <hi>C</hi>'s distinction of <hi>A
Covenant of Works,</hi> and <hi>The Covenant of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54465:134"/>
Works?</hi> Now the matter is plain and
evident, That as there never were, are,
or can be more than two common Heads
appointed by God, namely <hi>Adam,</hi> and
<hi>Christ, 1 Cor. 15. 45, 46, 47, 48. Rom.</hi> 5.
15, 17, 18, 19. so it is impossible there
should be more than two Covenants, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which Mankind stands, under these
two common Heads. And the First Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
once broken, it is utterly impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that fallen Man should ever attain
life that way, or that ever God should
set it up again with such an intention and
scope,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Charnock</hi> on the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, p. 390.</note> 
                     <hi>unless</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> speaks)
<hi>he had reduced man's Body to the dust, and
his Soul to nothing, and framed another
man to have governed him by a Covenant
of Works; but that had not been the same
man that had revolted, and upon his revolt
was stained and disabled.</hi> If Mr. <hi>C.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be not able to prove more Covenants
of Works with Mankind than one, let
him rather blush at his silly distinction
betwixt <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> Covenant of Works, and <hi>the</hi>
Covenant of Works. For indeed he
makes at least four distinct Covenants
of Works, one with <hi>Adam,</hi> two with
<hi>Moses;</hi> one Moral, the other Ceremonial;
and a fourth with <hi>Abraham</hi> at the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Circumcision, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="tcp:54465:134"/>
(2.) If it appear (as it clearly doth)
that as there never was, is, or can be any
more than one Covenant of Works, so
whatsoever Covenant is distinguished
from it by a Mediator, and dedication by
the sprinkling of blood (as he saith the
Ceremonial Law was) cannot possibly,
for the Reasons he gives, be any part or
member of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant of Works;
then, I hope, I have done M. <hi>C.</hi> no
wrong in my assumption from his own
words, for which he so reviles and abuses
me. But this will appear as plain as the
Noon-day-light: for a Covenant with a
Mediator, and dedicated by sprinkling
of blood, doth, and necessarily must essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
difference such a Covenant from
that Covenant that had no Mediator, nor
dedication by blood. To deny this, were
to confound Law and Gospel, <hi>Adam</hi>'s
and Christ's Covenant; but the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
betwixt them is his own, therefore
my assumption was just. That this
blood was typically the blood of Christ,
and that the Holy Ghost signified the one
by the other, is plain from <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 7, 8.
And I never met with that man that
scrupled it before Mr. <hi>Cary.</hi> So then my
first <hi>Argument</hi> to prove <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Circumcision to be the Covenant
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54465:135"/>
of Grace, and not an <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant,
or any part thereof, stands firm after
Mr. <hi>C</hi>'s passionate <hi>Reply,</hi> which I hope
the Lord will pardon to him, though he
had scarce Charity enough left to desire a
pardon for his Friend, who had neither
wronged the Truth, nor him.</p>

                  <p>My second <hi>Argument</hi> was this. If
Circumcision was the seal of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Faith, it did not pertain to the
Covenant of Works; for the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Faith and Works are opposite.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The sum of what he answers to this,
<hi>p. 72, 73, &amp;c.</hi> (as far as I can pick his
true sense out of a multitude of needless
words) is this. <q>
                        <hi>He confesses this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
seems very plausible; but however,</hi>
Abraham <hi>was a Believer before Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision;
and tho indeed it sealed the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Faith to him, yet it sealed it
to him only as the Father of Believers:
and denies that ever</hi> Jacob, <hi>or</hi> Isaac, <hi>or
any other enrolled in that Covenant, were
sealed by it; but to all the rest beside</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
<hi>it was rather a token of servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54465:135"/>
and bondage.</hi>
                     </q> This is the sum and
substance of his Reply.</p>
                  <p>But,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reply.</hi>
                     </note> Sir, let me ask you two or three
plain <hi>Questions.</hi> (1.) What is the reason
you silently slide over the <hi>Question</hi> I
asked you, <hi>p.</hi> 41. of my <hi>Vindiciae, &amp;c?</hi>
Did you find it an hot <hi>Iron,</hi> which you
durst not touch? 'Tis like you did.
My Question was this. <hi>Had</hi> Adam<hi>'s
Covenant a seal of the righteousness of
faith annexed to it, as this had,</hi> Rom. 4. 11?
<hi>The righteousness of faith is evangelical
righteousness, and this Circumcision sealed.
Say not it was to</hi> Abraham <hi>only that it
sealed it, for 'tis an injurious restriction put
upon the Seal of a Covenant which extended
to the Fathers, as well as to</hi> Abraham: <hi>how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
you admit that it sealed evangelical
righteousness to</hi> Abraham: <hi>but I hope you
will not say, that a Seal of the Covenant of
Works (for so you make Circumcision to be)
ever did, or could seal evangelical righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
to any individual person in the
World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I find you a man of great confidence,
but certainly here it failed you: not one
word in Reply to this. <q>(2.) I told
you your distinction was invented by
<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and shew'd you where it
was confuted by Dr. <hi>Ames:</hi> but not a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54465:136"/>
word to that. (3.) I show'd, That
the extending of that Seal to all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
as well as <hi>Abraham,</hi> is most
agreeable to the drift and scope of the
Apostle's Argument, which is to prove,
that both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are justified
by Faith, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was: and that
the ground of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ustification is common
to both: and that how great soever
<hi>Abraham</hi> was, yet in this case he hath
found nothing whereof to glory. And
is not your Exposition a notable one,
to prove the community of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Justification, because the Seal
of it was peculiar to <hi>Abraham alone?</hi>

                  <p>Sir, You have spent words enough
upon this Head to tire your Reader. But
why can I not meet with one word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, that fairly advances to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with my <hi>Argument?</hi> or answer the
important <hi>Questions</hi> before you, upon
which the matter depends? If this be all
you have to say, I must tell you, You
are a weak manager of a bad Cause;
which is the less hazard to Truth.</p>

of special interest: but it being upon such
hard terms, that it's utterly impossible for

                     </q> and bring
<hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 2. to prove it.</p>
                  <p>This is new and strange Divinity with
me.<note place="margin">Reply.</note> (1.) That God should become a
People's God by way of special interest,
by vertue of the broken Covenant of
Works. This wholly alters the nature
of that Covenant; for then it was a Law
that could give life, contrary to <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21.
unless you can suppose a Soul that's total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dead in Sin, to have a special interest
in God, as his God. (2.) This Answer
of yours yields the Controversy about the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:54465:137"/>
nature of the <hi>Sinai Law:</hi> for this very
Concession of yours, is the <hi>Medium</hi> by
which our Divines prove it to be a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace. (3.) This Concession
of yours confounds the two Covenants,
by communicating the essential property
and prime privilege of the Covenant of
Grace; to <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant of Works.
Either therefore expunge <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 33. as
a Covenant of Grace, <hi>I will be their God,
and they shall be my people;</hi> or allow that
in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. to be specifically the same;
and that <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. though more obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delivered. (4.) <q>You assert, <hi>That
God may actually become a Peoples God
by way of special interest, and yet the
salvation of that People be suspended
upon impossible terms.</hi>
                     </q> You sent them
before to <hi>Purgatory,</hi> but by this you
must send them directly to <hi>Hell:</hi> for
if the salvation of God's peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
be upon impossible terms, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
they cannot be saved. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
It is an horrid reflection upon the
Wisdom and Goodness of God, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did, or will make any Covenant,
wherein he takes fallen Men to be his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
People, and make over himself to
be their God; and yet not make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for their Salvation in the same Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54465:137"/>
but leave their Salvation for many
Ages upon hard and impossible terms,
(<hi>i. e.</hi>) leave them under damnation.</p>
                  <p>(2.) I told you in my <hi>Vindiciae, &amp;c.</hi>
p. 49. that you were fain to cut <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. into two parts;
and make the first to be the pure Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace, which is the promisory
part to the <hi>9th verse;</hi> and the Restipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(as you call it, <hi>p.</hi> 205.) to be as
pure a Covenant of Works. Which I
truly said was <hi>a bold Action;</hi> and in so
calling it, I gave it a softer name than
the nature of it deserved.</p>
                  <p>The sum of what you reply to this,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mr.</hi> C<hi>'s Defence, p.</hi> 79.</note> is,
(1.) By denying the matter of fact, and
charging me with misrepresentation; and
in the next page confessing the whole
Charge, saying, Though the Promise
and the Restipulation, mentioned <hi>vers.</hi> 7,
8, 9. make but one and the same Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Circumcision; yet there are two
Covenants mentioned in that Context,
the first between God and <hi>Abraham</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>vers.</hi> 2, 4. the other between God
and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his natural Posterity
also, <hi>vers.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10. The former you
call a Covenant of Grace, the latter a
Covenant of Works. And <hi>p.</hi> 81. you
affirm, That after God had entred the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54465:138"/>
Covenant of Grace with <hi>Abraham,</hi> v. 2, 4.
that <hi>Abraham</hi> himself was required to be
circumcised by the Command of God, as a
Token of the Covenant of Works. And
then<note place="margin">P. 81.</note> (after some unbecoming Scoffs for
misplacing <hi>vers.</hi> 7, 8. where <hi>vers.</hi> 9, 10.
should be; as also of <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. for <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.
(whether by the <hi>Scribe,</hi> my <hi>Self,</hi> or <hi>Press,</hi>
I cannot say; but in each place sufficient
light is given to set you right in the scope
and Argument of my Discourse) you tell
us, That <hi>how harsh and unlikely soever it
may seem to man's carnal reason, that the
latter, to wit, the Covenant of Works
made with</hi> Abraham, <hi>vers. 9, 10. must
needs make void the Covenant of Grace
made with him,</hi> vers. 2, 4. <hi>yet the Apostle
gives a quite contrary resolution of it,</hi> Gal. 3.
17. And after all, <hi>p.</hi> 79. in return to
my <hi>Argument,</hi> That the Circumcision of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, <hi>vers.</hi> 9, 10.
could not possibly be a condition of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s
Covenant of Works from the nature
of the act:<note place="margin">☞</note> because <hi>Paul</hi> himself circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Timothy, Act.</hi> 16. 1, 2, 3. and asserts it to
be a part of his Liberty, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 3. 4. which
could never be, if in the very nature of
the act it had bound <hi>Timothy</hi> to keep the
Law for justification; and had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the whole scope of the Apostle's
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:54465:138"/>
Doctrine: but it became an obligation
only from the intention of the Agent.
All that you say to this, <hi>p.</hi> 95. is, <q>That
as for <hi>Paul's compliance with the Iews,
however the case stood in that respect,
this is certain, That the blessed Apostle
would never have expressed himself with
that vehemency he doth,</hi> Gal. 5. 2, 3.
<hi>if this had been only the sense of the
Iewish Teachers, or that Circumcision in
its own nature did not oblige to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the whole Law; and that this is
only my corrupt gloss upon the Text.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If there be but one Covenant made
betwixt God and <hi>Abraham</hi> in that <hi>17th</hi>
of <hi>Genesis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reply.</note> and you make two, not only
<hi>numerically,</hi> but <hi>specifically</hi> distinct, yea,
opposite Covenants of it; then you bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cut God's Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> in
two, and are guilty of an insufferable
abuse of the Covenant of God. But the
former is true: therefore so is the latter.
You say, <hi>p.</hi> 223, 224. of your Call,
<q>That at the <hi>second</hi> and <hi>fourth Verses</hi>
God made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi>
himself alone; but at <hi>verse</hi> 7. he makes
the Covenant of Circumcision betwixt
himself and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his natural
Seed also; and saith, <hi>vers. 7. And,</hi> or
(according to the old Translation)
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54465:139"/>
                        <hi>Moreover;</hi> as proceeding to speak of
another Covenant than what he had
been before insisting on.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I would soberly ask, (1.) What
Vouchers you have amongst Expositors
for this your rash and daring Assertion?
I find not a man that hath trod this path
before you, and I hope none will be
hardy enough to follow. You certainly
stand alone, and 'tis pity but you should.
(2.) Where do you find the just parts of
the New Covenant in the <hi>2d</hi> and <hi>4th
verse?</hi> Is it not altogether promisory on
God's part, without any restipulation on
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s? for you have excluded <hi>v.</hi> 1,
9, 10. from that which you call God's
Covenant of Grace with him. And then
for your Covenant of Works, <hi>vers.</hi> 7, 8,
9, 10. you make this to be the Promiso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part of that Covenant, <hi>to be a God unto
thee, and to thy Seed after thee;</hi> and again
vers. 8. <hi>I will be their God.</hi> Was ever
such a Promise as this, found in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works? Tell me what-ever God
said more in the New Covenant, than he
saith here? Oh blessed Covenant of
Works, if this be such! (3.) Tell me
whether you can satisfy your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
with the Answers you have given
to my first Argument against your para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxical,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54465:139"/>
yea heterodoxical Exposition?
I told you, That if <hi>vers.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
another Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> of Works,
entred by God with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his
Seed, it must needs make void the former
Covenant, <hi>vers.</hi> 2, 4. for where-ever the
Covenant of Works takes place, the Co-Covenant
of Grace gives place; they
cannot consist, as I have abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
before. Do you verily think those
words of the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. which
you bring as a foundation to support your
singular and sinful Exposition, <hi>viz. And
this I say, That the Covenant that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
before of God in Christ, the Law,
which was four hundred and thirty years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
cannot disannul that it should make the
Promise of none effect;</hi> do you think (I
say) that in that, or any other Text, the
Apostle opposes the two Covenants made
(as you fancy) with <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17?
or doth he not there speak of God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as distinguished
from the Law made 430. years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward?
(4.) Have you satisfied your own
Judgment and Conscience in the Reply
you make to that unanswerable Objection
from <hi>Paul</hi>'s circumcising of <hi>Timothy,
Acts</hi> 16. 2, 3. where you have the plain
matter of fact before you, that he was
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54465:140"/>
circumcised by <hi>Paul;</hi> and this Fact of
his, justified as a part of the Liberty
he had in Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 3, 4. from
whence it evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,<note place="margin">Teneter non simpli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> That Circumcision
in its own nature did not
simply and absolutely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
men to the keeping of
<hi>Moses</hi> his Law for Righteousness, but
only from the intention or opinion of
the Person. And though you call this
my corrupt gloss upon the Text, therein
you grosly abuse me. The gloss is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
corrupt, nor my own; but the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
Judgment of all sound Expositors
of the Text, as you might see, were you
capable of seeing it, in a Collection of
their Judgments upon that Text, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.
2, 3. in Mr. <hi>Poole's Synopsis.</hi> And tho
<hi>Estius</hi> thinks the Act of Circumcision
might be obligatory to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to
whom the Law was not given; yet it
was not so to the <hi>Iews</hi> that believed, and
such was <hi>Timothy.</hi> But why do I refer
you to the Judgment of <hi>Commentators?</hi>
the very reason of it may convince you:
For,</p>
                  <p>If the very Act of Circumcision did
in its own nature oblige all on whom it
passed, to keep the whole Law for their
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54465:140"/>
Righteousness, then <hi>Paul</hi> so obliged <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi>
and all others on whom he passed
it, to keep the Law for their Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Paul</hi> did not oblige <hi>Timothy,</hi> or
any other on whom he passed it, by the
very Act of Circumcision so to keep the
Law.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the very Act of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in its own nature did not oblige all
on whom it passed, to keep the whole
Law for Righteousness.</p>
                  <p>You may ponder this <hi>Argument</hi> at your
leisure, and not think to refute it at so
cheap a rate, as by calling it a corrupt
gloss of my own. And thus I hope I
have sufficiently fortified and confirmed
my Third Argument, to prove <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
Covenant to be a Covenant of Grace.
My Fourth was this.</p>

of your <hi>Reply.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> I take you for an honest man:
and every honest man will be as good as
his word. Either I have fully proved
against you, that the <hi>Sinai</hi> Law (taken
in that latitude you here express it) is
not an <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant of Works, or I
have not. If I have not, doubtless you
have reserved your more pertinent and
strong Replies in your own breast, and
trust not to those weak and silly ones
which you see here baffled, and have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
served to involve you in greater Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities
than before. But if you have
brought forth all your strength (as in
such a desperate strait no man can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
but you would) then I have fully
proved the point against you. And if I
have, I expect you to be ingenuous and
candid in making good your word, That
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:54465:141"/>
you will then grant with me, that this
<hi>Argument</hi> is convincing to the end for
which it was designed. And so I hope
we have fully issued the Controversy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, relating to God's Covenant
with <hi>Abraham.</hi> You have indeed four
<hi>Arguments,</hi> p. 59, 60, 61, 62. of your
<hi>Reply,</hi> to prove <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant a
Covenant of Works of the same nature
with <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Because as life was implicitly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to <hi>Adam</hi> upon his obedience, and
death explicitly threatned in case of his
disobedience, which made that properly
a Covenant of Works; so it was in the
Covenant of Circumcision, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8.
compared with <hi>vers.</hi> 10, 14.</p>
                  <p>This Argument or Reason can never
conclude:<note place="margin">Reply.</note> because as God never requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Children, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal,
perfect, and perpetual obedience
to the whole Law for life, as he did of
<hi>Adam;</hi> so the death, or cutting off, spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of here, seems to be another thing
from that threatned to <hi>Adam.</hi> Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
(as I told you before) was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be the discriminating Sign betwixt
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and the Heathen World:
and the wilful neglect thereof is here
threatned with cutting off by Civil or
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54465:142"/>
Ecclesiastical Excommunication from
the Commonwealth, and Church of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
as <hi>Luther, Calvin, Paraeus, Muscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
&amp;c. expounds; not by death of Body
and Soul, as was threatned to <hi>Adam,</hi>
without place for repentance, or hope
of mercy.</p>
                  <p>(2.) You say <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant
could not be a Covenant of Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Faith was not reckoned to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
for Righteousness in Circumcision,
but in Uncircumcision, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>This is weak reasoning.<note place="margin">Reply.</note> Circumcision
could not belong to a Gospel-covenant,
because <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Believer before he
was circumcised. You may as well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> to be the Seal of a
Gospel-Covenant, because the Partakers
of it are Believers before they partake of
it. Beside, you cannot deny but it sealed
the Righteousness of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith to <hi>Abraham:</hi>
and I desired you before, to prove that a
Seal of the Covenant of Works i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> capable
of being applied to such an use and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
which you have not done, nor ever
will be able to do; but politickly slided
by it.</p>
                  <p>(3.) You say it cannot be a Covenant
of Grace, because it is contra-distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Righteousness of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.
13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:54465:142"/>
The Law in that place is put strictly
for the pure Law of Nature,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> and <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptically</hi>
signifies the Works of the Law,
which is a far different thing from the
Law taken in that latitude wherein you
take it. And is not this a pretty Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that because the promise to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and his Seed, was not through the
Law, but through the Righteousness of
Faith; therefore the Covenant of God
made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. cannot be a gracious, but a legal
Covenant? This Promise mentioned
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 13. was made to <hi>Abraham</hi> long
before the Law was given by <hi>Moses:</hi> and
Free-grace, not <hi>Abraham</hi>'s legal Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
was the impulsive cause moving
God to make that Promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and to his Seed: and their enjoyment of
the Mercies promised, was not to be
through the Law, but through the
Righteousness of Faith. By what rule
of art this Scripture is alledged to prove
God's Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17.
to be a Covenant of Works, I am utterly
to seek. If it be only because <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
was added to it, that's answered over
and over before; and you neither have,
nor can reply to it.</p>

                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:54465:143"/>
(4.) Lastly, It cannot (say you) be
a Covenant of Grace, because it's repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to us in Scripture as a Bondage-covenant,
<hi>Acts 15. 10, &amp;c. Gal.</hi> 5. 1.</p>

                     </note> I see, to make an end.
Your discourse runs low, and dreggy.
Do you think it is one and the same thing
to say, That the Ceremonial Law was a
yoke of bondage to them that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, and to say it was an <hi>Adam</hi>'s Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?
Are these two parallel distinctions
in your <hi>Logick?</hi> Alas! Sir, there is a
wide difference. The difficulty, varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and chargeableness of those Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
made them indeed burthensome and
tiresome to that People; but they did
not make the Covenant, to which they
were annexed, to become an <hi>Adam</hi>'s Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Works: for in the very next
breath, <hi>vers.</hi> 11. the Apostle will tell you,
<hi>they were saved;</hi> yea, and tells us, that
<hi>we shall be saved even as they.</hi> So that
either they that were under this yoke,
were saved by Faith in the way of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
as we now are; or we must be
saved in the way of legal Obedience, as
they were. Take which you please, for
one of them you must take. <hi>We shall be
saved, even as they,</hi> Acts 15. 10, 11.</p>

If you can make no stronger opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to my <hi>Arguments,</hi> than such as you
have here made, your Cause is lost;
though your confidence and obstinancy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.
It were easy for me to fill more
Paper than I have written on this Subject,
with Names of principal note in the

your groundless <hi>Position,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
affirm, that the Law in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
sense you take it, as it comprehends
the Ceremonial Rites and Ordinances
whereunto Circumcision pertains, is,
and can be no other than the Covenant of
Grace, though more obscurely admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred.

in their fashion unto the People. In
the 15th of <hi>Numbers, vers.</hi> 28. (I will
give you but one Instance) there you
shall plainly see, That the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Priestly Office had remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Sins as the main end of that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration.
<hi>If a Soul sin through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
he shall bring a She-goat unto
the Priest, and he shall make an atonement
for the Soul that sinneth ignorantly, and
it shall be forgiven him:</hi> See, the main
end is administring forgiveness of
Sins.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And that Christ was the main Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of that their Ministry, is plain,
because the Apostle saith in the Verse
before my Text, That all that Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
was but a Shadow of Christ,
and a Figure for the present to represent
him, as he doth express in the <hi>9th
Chapter</hi> of this <hi>Epistle.</hi> And the truth
is, the usual general Gospel that all the
<hi>Iews</hi> had, was in their Sacrifices and
Priestly Observations.</q>—</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>So that it's plain, the administration
of their Covenant was an administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Grace, and absolutely distinct
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:54465:144"/>
from the administration of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works.</q> And what can be said
more absolutely and directly contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to your <hi>Position,</hi> than this is? And
yet again, <hi>p.</hi> 250. speaking to that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8. <q>where the Apostle
distinguishes of a <hi>better</hi> and a <hi>faulty,</hi>
of <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second;</hi> he saith, <hi>Finding
fault with them, The days come, when
I will make a new Covenant with the
House of</hi> Israel, <hi>and with the House of</hi>
Judah, <hi>not according to the Covenant I
made with their Fathers, when I took
them by the hand to lead them out of the
Land of</hi> Egypt; and (as <hi>Ieremiah</hi> adds
it, for the Apostle takes all this out of
<hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 31.) <hi>although I was an Husband
to them;</hi> and in the close of all, <hi>Your
Sins and Iniquities will I remember no
more.</hi>—Here are two Covenants, a
<hi>new Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>Covenant he
made with their Fathers.</hi> Some may
think it was the Covenant of works
at the promulgation of the Moral
Law; but mark well that Expression
of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and you shall see it was
the Covenant of Grace. <hi>For</hi> (saith he)
<hi>not according to the Covenant I made with
their Fathers, although I was an Husband
unto them. How can God be considered
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54465:145"/>
as Husband to a People under the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works, which was broken by man
in innocency, and so became disannulled
or impossible by the breach of it? The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Works runs thus: Cursed is
every one that continueth not in all things
that are written in the Book of the Law;</hi>
and, <hi>In the day thou sinnest, thou shalt die
the death. Man had sinned before God
took him by the hand to lead him out of the
Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and Sin had separated
Man from God: how then can God be
called an Husband in the Covenant of
Works? The Covenant therefore was not
a Covenant of Works, but such a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
as the Lord became an Husband in,
and that must be a Covenant of Grace,</hi>
                     </q>
&amp;c.</p>
                  <p>How the Doctor makes good his two
distinct Covenants of Grace, I see not,
nor expect ever to see proved, and is not
my present concernment to enquire; but
once it is evident by what he hath here
said, That the Ceremonial Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Circumcision is a branch, can be no
other than the Covenant of Grace. And
nothing is more common among our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
than to prove not only the <hi>Sinai</hi>
Law, but God's Covenant with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
Gen. 17. to be the Covenant of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:54465:145"/>
Grace by this <hi>Medium, That God having
entred into a Covenant of Grace with</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
<hi>before, would never bring him under a
Covenant of Works afterwards, which must
nullify and void the former.</hi> And beside,
such a Covenant of Works as you make
this, was never heard of in the World,
wherein God promises to be a God to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
and his Seed, in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
upon the rigorous and impossible
Terms of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant.</p>
                  <p>By this time, I presume, you must feel
the force of those Arguments produced
against your vain and groundless notion;
and how little you are able to do to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
your <hi>Thesis</hi> from them, but the
more you struggle, the more still you
are intangled. Go which way you will,
your Absurdities follow you as your Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
—<hi>haeret lateri lethalis arundo.</hi>
Leaving therefore all your Absurdities
upon you, till God shall give you more
illumination and ingenuity to discern and
acknowledge them; I shall pass on to the
examination of your <hi>third Position,</hi> which
led you into these other gross Mistakes;
and if God shall convince you of your Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
in this point, I hope it may prove a
means of recovering you out of the rest:
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:54465:146"/>
which in love to your Soul, I heartily
desire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>III. Your third</hi> Position <hi>is,</hi> That God's
Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17. can be
no other than the Covenant of Works, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Circumcision was the Condition of it:
For <hi>(say you)</hi> the new Covenant is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
absolute, and unconditional.</p>

                  <head>Of the Conditionality of the New
Covenant.</head>
                  <p>This Question, Whether the Covenant
of Grace be conditionate or absolute, was
moved (as a learned Man observes) in
the former Age, by occasion of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
about Justification, betwixt the
<hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Papists.</hi> Among the
<hi>Protestants,</hi> some denied, and others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
the Conditionality of the Gospel-covenant.
Those that denied it, did so
for fear of mingling Law and Gospel,
Christ's Righteousness and Man's, as the
<hi>Papists</hi> had wickedly done before. Those
that affirmed it, did so out of fear also;
lest the necessity of Faith and Holiness
being relaxed, <hi>Libertinism</hi> should be that
way introduced. But if the Question
were duly stated, and the sense of its
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:54465:146"/>
Terms agreed upon, the Gospel-Covenant
may be affirmed to be conditional, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the People of God from <hi>Libertinism,</hi>
without the least diminution of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ, or clouding the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
of God.</p>
                  <p>I did in my first Answer to your <hi>Call,</hi>
endeavour to prevent the needless trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you have here given your self, by a
succinct state of the Question: telling
you the Controversy betwixt us, is not,
(1.) Whether the Gospel-covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
no duties at all of them that are
under it? nor (2.) Whether it requires
any such Conditions as were in <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Covenant, namely, perfect, personal,
and perpetual Obedience under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of the Curse, and admitting no
place of Repentance? nor (3.) Whether
any Condition required by it on our part,
have any thing in its own nature meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
of the Benefits promised? nor
(4.) Whether we be able in our own
strength, and by the power of our Free-will,
without the <hi>preventing,</hi> as well as
the <hi>assisting</hi> Grace of God, to perform
any such work or duty as we call a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?
These things I told you were
to be excluded out of this Controversy.
But the only Question betwixt us, is,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:54465:147"/>
                     <hi>Whether in the New Covenant,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quest.</note> 
                     <hi>some act of
ours (though it have no merit in it, nor can
be done in our own single strength) be not
required to be performed by us antecedently
to a blessing or privilege consequent by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of a promise? And whether such an
act or duty, being of a suspending nature to
the blessing promised, it have not the true
and proper nature of a Gospel-condition?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In your <hi>Reply</hi> (contrary to all rule
and reason) you include and chiefly argue
against the very Particulars by me there
excluded; and scarcely (if at all) touch
the true Question, as it was stated, and
by you ought accordingly to have been
considered. I might therefore justly
think my self discharged from any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
concernment with you about it: for
if you will include what I plainly exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
you argue not against mine, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man's <hi>Position,</hi> which I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to defend. You here dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
meritorious Conditions, which I
explode and abhor as much as your self.
You say, <hi>p.</hi> 34. of your <hi>Reply,</hi> that a
Condition plainly implies something of
merit, by way of <hi>condignity</hi> or <hi>congruity;</hi>
which is false, and turns the Question
from me to the <hi>Papists.</hi> And were it not
more for the clearing up of so great a
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:54465:147"/>
Point for the instruction and satisfaction
of others, than any hope you give me of
convincing you, I should not have touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this Question again, unless I had found
your Replies more distinct and pertinent.
But finding the Point in controversy of
great weight, I will once more tell you,
<list>
                        <item>1. What the word [<hi>Condition</hi>] sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies.</item>
                        <item>2. In what sense it is by us used in
this Controversy.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>(1.) And first we grant, That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our word [<hi>Condition</hi>] nor your
term [<hi>Absolute</hi>] are either of them found
in Scripture, with respect to God's cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting
with Man; so that we contend
not about the signification of a Scripture
term. But though the word <hi>Conditional</hi>
be not there, yet the thing being found
there, That brings the word <hi>Conditional</hi>
into use in this Controversy. For we
know not how to express those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> sacred
<hi>Particles,</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
&amp;c. <hi>If, If not, Vnless, But if, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
Only,</hi> and the like, which are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
used to limit and restrain the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:54465:148"/>
Grants and Privileges of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<hi>Rom. 10. 9. Matt. 18. 3. Mark
5. 36. Mark 11. 26. Rom.</hi> 4. 24. I say,
we know not how to express the true
sense and force of these <hi>Particles</hi> in this
Controversy, by any other word so fit
and full as the word <hi>Conditional</hi> is. Now
this word <hi>Condition</hi> being a Law-term,
is variously used among <hi>Iurists;</hi> and the
various use of the word, occasions that
confusion which is found in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy.
He therefore that shall clearly
distinguish the various senses and uses of
the word, is most likely to labour with
success in this Controversy. I shall
therefore briefly note the principal senses
and uses of the term, and shew in what
sense we here take it. Of <hi>Conditions</hi>
there be two sorts.</p>
                  <list>
                     <head>Conditions.</head>
                     <item>1. Antecedent</item>
                     <item>2. Consequent</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>As to the latter, namely, <hi>consequent
Conditions,</hi> you your self acknowledge,
<hi>p.</hi> 100. <q>That in the outward dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of the Covenant, many things
are required of us in order unto the
participation or enjoyment of the
full end of the Covenant in glory.</q>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:54465:148"/>
So then the Covenant is acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be consequently conditional,<note place="margin">Si promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siones foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derisintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liganturde fine, nemo negare po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test esse conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Covenant so considered, <hi>à po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriori,</hi>

The only Question is about <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent Conditions;</hi>
and of these we are
here to consider,

                        <item>1. Such as respect the first Sanction of

So that our Question proceeds about such
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:54465:149"/>
                     <hi>antecedent Conditions</hi> only as respect the
Application of the Benefits of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
unto Men. And of these <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Conditions</hi> there are likewise two
sorts, which must be carefully distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Such Antecedent Conditions which
have the force of a meritorious
and impulsive Cause, which being
performed by the proper strength
of Nature, or at most by the help
of common assisting Grace, do give
a Man a right to the reward or
blessings of the Covenant. And
in this sense we utterly disclaim
antecedent Conditions, as I plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
told you, <hi>p.</hi> 61. of my <hi>Vindiciae,
&amp;c.</hi> Or,</item>
                     <item>2. An Antecedent Condition signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no more than an Act of ours,
which though it be neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in every degree, nor in the
least meritorious of the benefit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred;
nor performed in our own
natural strength; yet according to
the constitution of the Covenant,
is required of us in order to the
blessings consequent thereupon by
vertue of the Promise: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:54465:149"/>
the benefits and mercies
granted in the Promise in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
are, and must be suspended by
the Donor or Disposer of them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
it be performed. Such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
we affirm <hi>Faith</hi> to be. But
here again, Faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>
the Condition of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
is considered,

                           <item>1. Essentially.
Or,</item>
                           <item>2. Organically and Instrumentally.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>In the first consideration of <hi>Faith,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to its Essence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is contained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Obedience,</hi> and in that respect we
exclude it from justifying our persons,
or entitling us to the saving-mercies of
the New Covenant, as it is a work of
ours; and so I excluded it, <hi>p.</hi> 133. of
my <hi>Method of Grace,</hi> which you igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
or wilfully mistake, when in your
<hi>Reply, p.</hi> 88, 89. you object it against
me. Faith considered in this sense, is
not the Condition of the Covenant, nor
can pretend to be so, more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Grace. But</p>
                  <p>We consider it <hi>Organically,</hi> Relatively,
and (as most speak) Instrumentally, as
it receives Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 12. and so
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:54465:150"/>
gives us power to become the Sons of
God; it being impossible for any Man
to partake of the saving benefits of the
Covenant, but as he is united to Christ.
<hi>For all the Promises of God in him are
yea; and in him, Amen,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 20.
And united to Christ no Man can be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he be a believer; for Christ dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in our hearts by Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17.
Upon which Scriptural Grounds and
Reasons it is, that we affirm Faith to be
an Antecedent Condition, or, <hi>Causa sine
quâ non,</hi> to the saving benefits of the new
Covenant; and that it must go before
them, at least in order of nature, which
is that we mean, when we say Faith is
the antecedent Condition of the New
Covenant. And those that deny it to
be so, as the <hi>Antinomians</hi> do, who talk
of actual and personal Justification from
Eternity, or at least from the death of
Christ, must consequently assert the
actual Justification of <hi>Infidels;</hi> and not
only disturb, but destroy the whole order
of the Gospel, and open the Sluces and
Flood-gates to all manner of licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>And thus our Pious and Learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
generally affirm Faith to be the
condition of the Covenant.<note place="margin">

the great honour above all other Graces,
to be the <hi>Condition</hi> of the second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
therefore certainly it is some
great matter that Faith enables us to
do. Whatsoever keeps Covenant with
God, brings strength, though it self
be never so weak; as <hi>Sampson</hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s Hair.
What is weaker than a little Hair? Yet
because the keeping that, was keeping
Covenant with God; therefore even a
little Hair was so great strength to
<hi>Sampson.</hi> Faith then, that is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Covenant, in which all
Grace and Mercy is contained, if it
be kept, it will cause strength indeed
to do great things.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as this excellent Man, Mr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs,</hi>
is in this sense for the Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality
of the New Covenant; so are the
most Learned and Eminent of our own
Divines. Dr. <hi>Edward Reynold</hi>'s assigning
the differences betwixt the two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
gives this for one:<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold</hi>'s his Life of Christ. p. 512.</note> 
                     <q>They differ
in the Condition (saith he); there Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Obedience, here only Faith; and the
certain consequent thereof, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
There is difference likewise in
he manner of performing these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions:
For now God himself begins
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:54465:151"/>
first to work upon us, and in us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we move or stir towards him. He
doth not only command us, and leave
us to our created strength to obey the
Command; but he furnisheth us with
his own Grace and Spirit to obey the
Command.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the same judgment is Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi>

                     <q>Are we able (saith he) of our selves
to fulfil the Condition of the New
Covenant? Is it not as easie for a
Man by his own strength to fulfil the
whole Law, as to repent, and believe
the Promise of the Gospel? This then
is one main difference of these two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,
That the Lord did in the Old
only require the Condition; now in
the New, he also effects it in all the
foederates to whom the Covenant is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</q>

Faith that, which to Justification re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54465:153"/>
and their concurrence with those I have
named, evidenced by that Learned and
Pious Mr. <hi>Iohn Graile,</hi> in his <hi>Modest Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of the Doctrine of Conditions in
the Covenant of Grace,</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 58. on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
a Man whose name and memory
is precious with me, not only upon the
account of that excellent Sermon he
Preached, and those fervent Prayers he
poured out many years since at my Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
but for that Learned and Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<hi>Treatise</hi> of his against Mr. <hi>Eyre,</hi>
wherein he hath cast great light upon
this Controversy, as excellent Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> have also done. But
alas, what evidence is sufficient to satisfy
ignorant and obstinate Men!</p>
                  <p>Sir, it pities me to see the lamentable
confusion you are in. You are forced by
the evidence of truth to yield and own
the substance of what I contend for.
You have yielded the Covenant to be
consequently Conditional in <hi>p.</hi> 84. of your
<hi>Reply.</hi> You have also as plainly yielded,
that <hi>the Application of Pardoning Mercy
unto our Souls, is in order of nature conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
unto believing; p.</hi> 31. of your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</hi>
From both which concessions in
your own words recited, this Conclusion
is evident and unavoidable, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:54465:153"/>
That no adult person, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God's Eternal Election, and Christ's
meritorious death and satisfaction, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Constitution and Order of
the New Covenant, can either be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in this World, or saved in the World
to come, unless he first believe.</p>
                  <p>For if the Application of Pardoning
Mercy unto our Souls, is in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
consequent unto believing (as you
truly affirm it to be) then according to
the Constitution and Order of the New
Covenant, no application of pardoning
Mercy can be made to our Souls before
we believe. And if it be evident (as you
say it is, <hi>p.</hi> 84.) <hi>that unto a full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
enjoyment of all the Promises of the
Covenant, Faith on our part is required;</hi>
then as no Man can be actually justified
in this World, so neither can he be saved
before, or without Faith in the World
to come. And if you did but see the
true suspending nature of Faith, which
you plainly yield in these two concessions;
you would quickly grant the conditional
nature of it: For what is the proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and true notion of a Condition, but
to suspend the benefits and grants of that
Covenant in which it is so inserted? And
thus the Controversy betwixt us is fairly
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:54465:154"/>
issued. But I doubt you understand
not what you have here written, or are
troubled with a very bad memory: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I find you in a far different note
from this in <hi>p.</hi> 103. of your <hi>Reply,</hi> where
you say, <q>That <hi>if Iesus Christ fulfilled
the Law, and purchased Heaven and
Happiness for Men (as all true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
hitherto have taught) then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can remain, but to declare this to
them, to incline them to believe and
accept it; and to prescribe in what way,
and by what means they shall finally come
to inherit Eternal Life. To affirm there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that Faith and Repentance are the
Conditions of the New Covenant required
of us in point of Duty, antecedent to the
benefit of the Promise, doth necessarily
suppose, that Christ hath not done all for
us, nor purchased a right to Life for
any; but only made way that they may
have it upon certain terms, or (as some
say) he hath merited that we might me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
But the Conditions of the Covenant
are not to be performed by the Head and
Members both,</hi> Gal. 4. 4. <hi>Christ there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
having in our stead performed the
Conditions of Life, there remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a Promise, and the Obedience
of Children, as the fruit and effect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:54465:154"/>
to them that believe in him, together
with means of obtaining the full possession,
which here we want.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Either these passages I have here cited
and compared,<note place="margin">Reply:</note> were fetched at a great
distance of time, out of Authors differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as much in judgment as you and I
do; and so the dissonancy of them is the
meer effect of oblivion, and incogitancy:
Or else your Intellectuals are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
and weak than I am willing to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
them to be. For if the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Pardoning Mercy to our Souls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is in order of Nature consequent to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
(as you truly say it was); then
certainly, notwithstanding Christ's ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
the Law, and purchasing Heaven
and Happiness for Men, something else
must remain to be done, besides declaring
this to them, to incline them to believe
and accept it, or prescribing to them in
what way they shall finally come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
Eternal Life. For besides those
declarations and prescriptions you talk
of, Faith it self must be wrought in the
Souls of Men, or else Pardoning Mercy
is not in order of Nature consequent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
believing, as you said it was: For all
the external Declarations and Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the World are not Faith it self,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:54465:155"/>
but only the means to beget it; which
may, or may not, become effectual to
that end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas you say, that this
(senseless notion) is consequent upon the
Doctrine of all true <hi>Protestants,</hi> you
therein grosly abuse them, and make all
the true Protestants in the World guilty
of worse than <hi>Arminian</hi> or <hi>Antinomian</hi>
dotage. The <hi>Antinomian,</hi> indeed, makes
our actual justification to be nothing else
but the manifestation or declaration of
our Justification from Eternity, or the
time of Christ's death. And the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
tells us, That the Declaration of the
Gospel to Men, is sufficient to bring
them to Faith by the assisting Grace of
the Spirit.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But your notion is worse
than the very dregs of both, and yet
you tack it as a just consequent to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of all true <hi>Protestants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You say,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reply.</hi> P. 104.</note> That <hi>to affirm Faith
and Repentance to be the Conditions of the
New Covenant required of us in point of
Duty, antecedent to the benefit of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
doth necessarily suppose that Christ
hath not done all for us, nor purchased a
right to Life for any; but only made way
that they may have it upon certain terms,
or merited that we might merit.</hi> Here,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:54465:155"/>
Sir, you vilely abuse all those worthy
Divines before mentioned, who have
made Faith the Condition of the New
Covenant, pinning upon them both <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi>
and <hi>Iudaism. Popery,</hi> yea, the
dregs of <hi>Popery,</hi> in supposing their
Doctrine necessarily implies that <hi>Christ
hath merited that we might merit.</hi> And
<hi>Iudaism</hi> to the height, in saying,
<hi>their Doctrine necessarily supposes that Christ
hath not purchased a right of Life to any.</hi>
What can a <hi>Iew</hi> say more? Ah, Mr. <hi>C.</hi>
can you read the words I have recited
out of blessed <hi>Burroughs, Owen, Pemble,
Perkins, Davenant, Downame,</hi> yea, the
whole Assembly of Reverend and Holy
Divines, with multitudes more (who
have all with one mouth asserted Faith
to be the Condition of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
required on Man's part, in
point of Duty; and that Men must
believe before they can be justified;
which is the very same thing with
what I say, That it is antecedent to
the benefit of the Promise) and not
tremble to think of the direful char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
you here draw against them?
The Lord forgive your rash presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:54465:156"/>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whereas you say, Christ hath
in our stead performed the Conditions of
life, and that there remains nothing but
a Promise,<note place="margin">Sal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>marsh, <hi>of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. p.</hi> 126, 127.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you therein speak at the
highest dialect of <hi>Antinomianism;</hi> Hath
not Christ by his Life and Death per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the Conditions of Life in our
stead? yet you your self confess, that
pardoning Mercy is in order of nature
consequent to our believing; certainly then
there is something more to be done beside
the mere making, or being of a Promise:
there must be the effect of the Promise
in our hearts; yea, the effects of those
absolute Promises of the first Grace,
<hi>Ezek. 36. Ier.</hi> 32. Or else notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ's performance of Redemption
on his part, we can neither be justified
nor saved. For I don't think you intend
to lay the Conditions of Repentance or
believing upon Christ, who in the New
Covenant hath laid them upon us, tho in
the same Covenant he graciously under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to work them in us: and yet your
words sound in that wild <hi>Antinomian</hi>
Note.</p>
                  <p>But,<note place="margin">Objection.</note> I suppose, you take my Notion
to be as self-repugnant as your own,
when I say Faith is an antecedent Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Justification: because I also say,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:54465:156"/>
this Grace is also supernaturally wrought
in us, and is not of our selves. This
staggers you, and is the very stone you
stumble at all along this Controversie:
for in your sense, <hi>p.</hi> 34. every Condition
is meritorious by condignity or congruity.</p>
                  <p>First, What do I say more in all this,<note place="margin">Reply.</note>
than what those Worthies before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
do expresly affirm? Doth not
Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> (the man whom you deserved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
value) make Conditions both in <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Covenant and the New, with this
difference, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them, but the New Covenant effects
them in all the Foederates? Sir, We take
it for no contradiction to assert, That the
planting of the Principle, and the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
and exciting of the Acts of Faith,
are the proper Works of the Spirit of
God, and are also contained in the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Promises of the New Covenant,
<hi>Ezek. 36. 26, 27. Ier.</hi> 32. 39, 40. And
yet Faith, notwithstanding this, is truly
and properly our work and duty; and
that upon our believing, or not believing,
we have, or have not, an actual interest
in Christ, Righteousness, and Life. For
though the Author of Faith be the Spirit
of God, yet believing is properly our
Act, and an Act required of us by a
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:54465:157"/>
plain Command, 1 <hi>Iohn 3. 23. This is
the Command of God, That ye believe.</hi> And
if its being wrought in God's strength
makes it cease to be our Work, I would
fain know what Exposition you would
give of that place, <hi>Phil. 2. 12, 13. Work
out your own Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for it is God
that worketh in you both to will and to do.</hi>
And as this Faith is truly and properly
our work, though wrought in God's
strength (for it is not God, but we, that
do believe) so it is wrought in us by him
(by your own confession) before the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of pardoning Mercy, which is
consequent in order of nature thereunto:
and therefore hath the true nature of an
antecedent Condition, which is that I
contend for; and did you but understand
your own words, you would not contend
against.</p>
                  <p>Oh,<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> but say you, <hi>p.</hi> 34. every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is meritorious, either by way of
<hi>congruity</hi> or <hi>condignity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is your ignorance of the nature of
a Condition,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> with which I find you as
unacquainted as with the nature of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
A Condition, whilst unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
only suspends the act of the
Law or Testament: it being the will of
the <hi>Testator, Legislator,</hi> or <hi>Donor,</hi> that
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:54465:157"/>
his Law or Testament should act or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
when the Condition is performed,
and not before: but it is not essential to a
Condition, to be a meritorious or impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
cause moving him to bestow the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
for the sake thereof. A man freely
gives another out of his love and bounty
such an Estate or Sum of Money, which
he shall enjoy if he live to such a year, or
day; and not before: is this <hi>quando dies
veniet,</hi> this appointed time the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or impulsive cause of the gift? sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
no man will say it: but that it is a
<hi>causa sine quâ non,</hi> or a Condition suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the enjoyment of the gift, no man
will deny that knows what the nature of
a Condition is. An act meritorious by
way of <hi>Congruity,</hi> is that to which a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is not due out of strict justice, but
out of decency, or some kind of meetness.
Merit of <hi>condignity</hi> is a voluntary action,
for which a reward is due to a man out of
justice, and cannot be denied him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
injustice. Our Faith is truly the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the New Covenant, and yet we
detest the meritoriousness of it in either
sense.</p>
                  <p>But you object my words to me in my
<hi>Method of Grace,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Object. 3.</note> where I assert the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
of believing without the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54465:158"/>
of supernatural Grace, <hi>p.</hi> 102,
103.</p>
                  <p>Sir, I own the words you quote,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> and
am bold to challenge the most envious
Eye that shall read those lines, to shew
me the least repugnancy betwixt what I
said there, and what I have said in my
<hi>Vindiciae Legis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 9. of the <hi>Prolego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi>
and <hi>p.</hi> 61. of that Book. You
shew your good-will to make an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
thrust; but your Weapon is too
short, and can draw no blood. But lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
these weak and impertinent Cavils,
let us come to your Solution of my <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
p. 98. by which I proved the
Conditionality of the New Covenant.
My first <hi>Argument</hi> was this.</p>
                  <p>If we cannot be justified or saved till
we believe,<note place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 1</note> and are justified when we
believe; Then Faith is the Condition on
which those consequent Benefits are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The sum of your Answer (without
denying,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> distinguishing, or limiting one
Proposition) is this, That, <q>here Faith
is properly put into the room of perfect
Obedience, and is to do what perfect
Obedience was to do under the Law:
whereas (say you) Faith is only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
as an Instrument to receive and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:54465:158"/>
apply the Righteousness of Christ,
which is the alone matter of our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
before God; and Faith it self is
not our Righteousness, as it would be
if it were a Condition, <hi>p.</hi> 105, 106.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not to note the weakness and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence
of this Answer,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> I shall only take
notice of what you here allow, and
grant, That <hi>Faith is appointed as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
to receive and apply the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ, which is the alone matter
of our Iustification before God.</hi> Whence I
infer three Conclusions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That we cannot be justified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God till we believe, except you can
prove, that the unaccepted and unapplied
Righteousness of Christ doth actually ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify
our persons before God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the justification of our
persons before God, is, and must be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended
(as by a non-performed Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
untill we actually believe. Which
two Conclusions yield up your Cause to
my Argument, which you here seem to oppose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That hereby you perfectly
renounce and destroy your <hi>Antinomian</hi>
Fancy before-mentioned, That <hi>if Christ
have fulfilled the Law, and purchased
Heaven for men, nothing can remain but
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:54465:159"/>
to declare this to them,</hi> &amp;c. for it seems by
this, they must receive and apply Christ's
Righteousness by Faith, or they cannot
be justified (you say not <hi>declaratively</hi> in
their own Consciences, but) <hi>before God.</hi>
And thus instead of answering, you have
confirmed and yielded my first <hi>Argument,</hi>
and only oppose your own Mistakes, not
the sense or force of my <hi>Arguments,</hi> in all
that you say to it, or the Scriptures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to prove it.</p>
                  <p>To my second <hi>Argument,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 2.</note> recited <hi>p.</hi> 94.
where I argued from God's Covenant
with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and proved it to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional;
and yet by you acknowledged
to be a pure Gospel-covenant: all that
you say, is, That you have dispatched
that before, in your Discourse about the
Covenant of Circumcision, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will say nothing to it here.</p>
                  <p>In saying nothing to it here,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> you have
said as much as you did before in the
place you refer to; and therefore find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing said here or there, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
you can say nothing to it at all.</p>
                  <p>My third <hi>Argument</hi> was this.<note place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 3.</note> If all
the Promises of the Gospel be absolute
and unconditional, then they do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belong to the New Covenant. That
cannot properly and strictly be a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:54465:159"/>
which is not a mutual Compact,
and in which there is no restipulation,
nor reobligation: 'tis a naked Promise,
not a Covenant.</p>
                  <p>To this you answer three things.<note place="margin">Answer. <hi>p.</hi> 113, 114.</note>
In the first branch of your Answer you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
beg the Question, by saying,
That <q>
                        <hi>you have proved already in your
Replies to my former Arguments, that
the New Covenant is wholly free and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute.</hi>
Upon this absurd <hi>Petitio Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pii</hi>
you make bold to invert my <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
thus in your second Reply. <hi>If all
the Promises of the Gospel be wholly abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and unconditional, they do properly
and truly belong to the New Covenant:
But so they are. Therefore,</hi> &amp;c. Oh
rare Disputant! In the last place, in
opposition to the Sequel of my <hi>Major
Proposition,</hi> you tell me you will oppose
the Judgment of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> on <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10.
where he saith, That a Covenant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
is a Compact or Agreement on
certain terms stipulated by two or more
Parties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> and that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
there used, it signifies a Covenant im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you call this an opposition to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel
of my <hi>Major,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reply.</note> either your Brains or
mine do want <hi>Hellebore.</hi> Doth he not
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:54465:160"/>
say the very same thing I do, that there
must be a restipulation in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> proper Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?
And as for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
which (he saith) signifieth a Covenant
improperly, but prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rly is a <hi>Testamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Disposition,</hi> I fully concur with him
therein. But I hope a <hi>Testamentary Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
may have a Condition in it; to
be sure such a one as I assert Faith here to
be, which is the free gift of God; and in
this sense I shewed you before where the
<hi>Doctor</hi> yields Faith to be the Condition
of the New Covenant.</p>
                  <p>My fourth <hi>Argument</hi> was this.<note place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 4.</note> If all
the Promises of the New Covenant be
absolute and unconditional, and have no
respect nor relation to any grace wrought
in us, or duty done by us; then the trial
of our Interest in Christ by marks and
signs of Grace is not our duty, nor can
we take comfort in Sanctification as it is
an evidence of our Justification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your Answer is,<note place="margin">Answer. <hi>p.</hi> 120.</note> That <q>at this rate
I may prove <hi>quidlibet à quolibet:</hi> for it
doth not follow, that, because the
New Covenant is absolute, therefore
it hath no respect nor relation to any
Grace wrought in us, nor Duty done
by us, or that we may not justly take
comfort in Sanctification as an evidence
of our Justification.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:54465:160"/>
If I had a mind to learn the art of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>quidlibet à quolibet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reply.</note> and make my
self ridiculous to others by such foolish
attempts, I know no Book in the World
fitter to instruct me therein, than yours.
Certainly you have the knack of it, and
gave us an instance of it but now, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing
the Sequel of my <hi>Major</hi> by an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degation
out of Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> which expresly
confirms and establishes it. But to the
Point, I would willingly know how it is
possible for Sanctification to be a true and
certain mark and sign of Justification,
when (according to the <hi>Antinomian</hi>
Principle, which you here too much
comprobate and espouse) a man may be
justified before he believe, yea, before
he is a man, even from the time of
Christ's death, and (as others of them
speak) from eternity. A true mark and
sign must be proper to, and inseparable
from that which it signifies. Now if
that be true which you said before, That
<hi>after Christ's fulfilling of the Law in his
own person, &amp;c. nothing can remain but to
declare this to men to incline them to believe
and accept it, and to prescribe in what way
they shall come to inherit eternal life.</hi> If
this be all that can remain to us, then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Declarations and Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:54465:161"/>
of the Gospel, which are things
without us, can remain to be marks and
signs of Justification to us: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
all those to whom those Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Prescriptions are made and
given, have therein the marks and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of their Justification. But I am
truly weary of such stuff. I am sure the
Apostle places <hi>Vocation</hi> before <hi>Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
Rom. 8. 30. <hi>Whom he called, them
he justified.</hi> And without an immediate
Testimony from Heaven, I know not
how to evidence and prove my Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
but from, and by my faith, and
other parts of Sanctification; whereby
I apprehended and applied the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ: if you can prove it
from the Declarations and Prescriptions
of the Gospel, I cannot.</p>
                  <p>My Fifth and last <hi>Argument</hi> ran thus.<note place="margin">Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 5.</note>
If the Covenant of Grace be altogether
absolute and unconditional, requiring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to be done on our part, to entitle
us to its benefits; then it cannot be man's
duty in entring Covenant with God, to
deliberate the terms, count the cost, or
give his consent by word, or writing, to
the terms of this Covenant: for where
there are no terms at all (as in absolute
Promises there are none) there can be
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:54465:161"/>
none to deliberate. But I shewed you,
this is man's duty, from clear and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You say by way of answer hereunto,<note place="margin">Answer. <hi>p.</hi> 122, 123.</note>
that, <q>you must tell me, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
do make a plain distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the New and Everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
which God hath been pleased to
make with Sinners in Jesus Christ;
and the return of that sincere and duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
obedience which he requires of us,
by way of answer thereunto. (2.) You
say, there are many things, which tho
promised in the Covenant, and wrought
in us by the Grace of God; are yet du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
indispensably required of us in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the participation of the full end
of the Covenant in glory: and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
hereof, we are indeed to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the terms, count the cost, and
give up our selves solemnly to him
with sincere resolutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But then
you thought I had understood there
had been a vast difference betwixt
God's Covenant with us, and our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God, citing <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 59,
60, 61. where God promiseth to <hi>give
them their Sisters for Daughters, but
not by their Covenant.</hi> And with this
you compare <hi>Psal. 89. My Covenant
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:54465:162"/>
will I not break;</hi> where (you say) we
find a plain distinction betwixt God's
Covenant with them, and their duty
to God. And lastly, you say, <hi>p.</hi> 105.
that the want of a due observation of
this plain Scripture-distinction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
God's free and absolute Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
made with Sinners in Christ, and
our Covenants with God by way of
return thereunto; is the true reason of
all our mistakes about the true nature
of the Gospel-Covenant, whilst we
jumble and co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>found together that
which the Scriptures do so plainly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To your first Answer, I say:<note place="margin">Reply.</note> It is
true, the Scriptures do distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Covenant, and Covenant; that
of Works, and that of Grace. It also
distinguishes the same Covenant of
Grace for substance, according to its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
administrations, into the Old, and
New Covenant. It also distinguishes
betwixt the <hi>promissory part</hi> of the same
Covenant of Grace, and the <hi>restipulatory</hi>
part; not as of two opposite Covenants,
(as you distinguish them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.) but
as the just and necessary parts of one and
the same Covenant. It also distinguishes
betwixt Vows made by Men to God in
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:54465:162"/>
some particular Cases, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace betwixt God and them.
But what's all this to your purpose? Or
in what point doth it touch my <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
You desire me to cast mine eye
upon <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. I have
done so, and that impartially; and do
assure you, I admire why you produce
them against my <hi>Argument.</hi> That in
<hi>Ezek.</hi> speaks of the enlargement of the
Church by the accession of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
to it; and the sense of those words seems
to me to be this; That this enlargement
of the Church is a gracious addition, or
something beyond what God had ever
done in his former dispensations of the
Covenant to that People. And for
<hi>Psal.</hi> 89. I know not what you meant
to produce it for, unless it be to prove
what I never denied, That notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our failures in duty towards God,
God will still keep his Covenant with
us; though he will visit the Iniquities of
his Covenant-p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ople with a Rod.</p>
                  <p>To your second Answer, That we are
to deliberate the terms, and count the
cost, with respect to those duties, which
are in order to the participation of the full
end of the Covenant in glory: by which,
I suppose, you mean Self-denial, Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:54465:163"/>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have no Controversy
with you about that. Our Question is,
Whether there be no deliberations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of, or to be performed by men,
who are not yet in Christ by justifying
Faith, but under some preparatory
works towards Faith? And whether at
the very time of their closing with Christ,
there be not a consent of the Will unto
those terms required of them? If you
say there be (as by the places I alledged
it evidently appears there are) then you
yield the point I contend for. If you
say they are not before, or at the time
of believing, to consider any terms, or give
their consent to them by word or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
such an Answer would fly in the
very face of those Scriptures I produced:
for then a man may be in covenant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his own consent: he that deliberates
not, consents not; <hi>non consentit, qui non
sentit.</hi> And therefore you durst not
speak it out (for which modesty I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
you) and so leave me with half an
answer, not touching that part, <hi>viz.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent
deliberations which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in this <hi>Argument.</hi> And now let
your most partial Friends judge, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from this performance of yours, you
have any just ground for that vain boast
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:54465:163"/>
which concludes your Answer, <hi>viz.
<q>That the Covenants themselves, which
those Privileges are bottomed on, are now
repealed, and that there is no room left
for any other Argument to infer the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
of Infants:</q>
                     </hi> at least, I shall willingly
commit it to the judgment of all intelligent
and impartial Readers, Whether Mr. <hi>Cary</hi>
hath any real ground in this performance
of his, for such a Thrasonical Conclusion,
such a vain and fulsome Boast?</p>
                  <p>I find that with like confidence he hath
also attempted a Reply to Mr. <hi>Ioseph
Whiston,</hi> a Reverend, Learned, and
Aged Divine, who hath accurately and
successfully defended God's Covenant
with <hi>Abraham,</hi> against Mr. <hi>Cox;</hi> and
doubt not, if Mr. <hi>Cary,</hi> and his Party,
have but confidence enough to expose
it to the publick view, and to adventure the
Cause of Infant-baptism upon it, the World
will quickly see an end of this long-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
and unhappy Controversy, which
hath vexed the Church of God, and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
the Affections of good Men: and
that the Wisdom of Providence hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
and over-ruled this last Attempt,
to the singular advantage of the Truths
of God, and tranquillity of good Men,
whose concernment (at this time especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally)
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:54465:164"/>
is rather to strengthen their Faith,
and heighten their Encouragements from
God's gracious Covenant, than to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
it, when all things beside it are
shaking and tottering round about them.</p>
                  <p>And now, Sir, for a <hi>Coronis</hi> to all
those things that have been controverted
betwixt us about the Covenants of God,
and the right of Believers Infants to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
resulting from one of them, which I
have asserted and argued against you in
my first <hi>Answer,</hi> and you have silently
and wholly pass'd over in your <hi>Reply,</hi>
hoping to destroy them all at once, by
proving God's Covenant with <hi>Abraham,
Gen.</hi> 17. to be a pure <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant
of Works; I judge it necessary, as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
now lie between us, to give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the grounds and reasons of my Faith
and Practice with respect unto the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Infant Baptism, and that as
succinctly and clearly as I can, in the
following <hi>Theses;</hi> which being laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by an unprejudiced and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Reader, will, I think, amount to
more than a strong probability, That <hi>it
is the will of God, that the Infant-seed of
Believers ought now to be baptized.</hi>

lities perfectly and compleatly to obey all

immediately entred into the <hi>Covenant of

his standing or falling was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the perfection and constancy of his

no provision at all was made for his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

repentance or better obedience; but the
Curse immediately seized both Soul and
Body: and Sin by the Fall entring into
Man's nature, totally disabled him to the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Soon after the violation and cessation of
this first Covenant, as a Covenant of Life,
it pleased the Lord to open and publish the
second Covenant of Grace by Iesus Christ,
the first dawning whereof we find in</hi> Gen. 3.
15. <hi>where the Seed is promised which shall
bruise the Serpent's head.</hi> And though
this be but a very short, and somewhat
obscure discovery of Man's Remedy and
Salvation by Christ; yet was it a joyful
sound to the ears of God's people, it was
even life from the dead to the Believers
of those times. For we may rationally
conclude, That that space of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the breaking of the first, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the second Covenant; was the
most dismal period of time that ever the
World did, or shall see. This Covenant
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:54465:167"/>
of Grace now took place of the Covenant
of Works, comprehended all Believers
in the bosom of it. The Covenant of
Works took place from the time it was
made until the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and then
was abolished as a Life-giving Covenant.
The second Covenant took place from
the time it was made soon after the fall,
and is to continue to the end of the World.
And these only are the two Covenants
God hath made with Men; the latter
succeeding the former, and commencing
from its expiration; but both cannot
possibly be in force together at the same
time, and upon the same persons, as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
Covenants of Life and Salvation.
For in co-ordination they expel and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
each other, <hi>Gal. 5. 4. Whosoever of
you are justified by the Law, ye are fallen
from Grace.</hi> The first Covenant was a
Covenant without a Mediator; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is a Covenant with a Mediator.
Place a Believer under both at once, or
put these two Covenants in co-ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that which results will be a
pure contradiction, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Man is
saved without a Mediator, and yet by a
Mediator. Moreover, if there be a
way to Life without a Mediator, there
was no need to make a Covenant in and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:54465:167"/>
with a Mediator; nor can those words of
Christ be true, <hi>Ioh. 4. 6. I am the way,
the truth, and the life: no man cometh to
the Father but by me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Righteousness of the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
was within Man himself; the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of the second Covenant is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Man in Christ. Put these two in
co-ordination, and that which results is
as pure a contradiction as the former; <hi>viz.</hi>
That a Man is justified by a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
within him, and yet is justified by
a Righteousness without him; expresly
contrary to the Apostle's conclusion,
<hi>Rom. 3. 20. Therefore by the deeds of the
Law there shall no flesh be justified in his
sight.</hi> It is therefore an intolerable ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
to place believers under both these
Covenants at the same time; under the
Curse of the first, and Blessing of the
second. For whensoever the state of
any person is changed by Justification,
his Covenant is changed with his State,
<hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. 'Tis as unimaginable that a
Believer should thus stand under both
Covenants, as it is to imagine that a Man
may be born of two Mothers, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 22,
23, 24, 25. or a Woman lawfully Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to two Husbands, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 1, 2, 3, 4.
and more absurd (if it be possible any
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:54465:168"/>
thing can be more absurd) to attribute
the most glorious privilege of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace, (viz. <hi>I will be a God to
thee, and to thy seed after thee,</hi> Gen. 17. 7.)
to the impotent and abolished Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works; both which absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are asserted in defence of <hi>Antipoedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And though it be true, that after the
first Edition of the Covenant of Grace,
the matter of the first Covenant was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Moral
Law; yet that representation was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
and designed to be subservient,
and added to the Promise, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 19.
and so (as an Acute and Learned Divine
<note n="*" place="margin">Turret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini, Pars 2<hi rend="sup">da</hi>. loc. 12. p. 248.</note> speaks) the very <hi>Decalogue</hi> or <hi>Moral
Law</hi> it self pertained to the Covenant of
Grace; yea, in some sort flowed out of
this Covenant, as it was promulged by
the Counsel of God to be serviceable to
it; both <hi>anteccdently</hi> to lead Men by the
conviction of sin, fear of wrath, and
self-despair, to the Covenant of Grace;
and also consequently as it is a pattern of
Obedience and Rule of Holiness. For
had it been published as a Covenant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
intentionally to its primitive use
and end, it had totally frustrated the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace.</p>

                  <head>Thesis III.</head>
                  <p>Though the primordial Light or first
glimmerings of this Covenant of Grace,
were comparatively weak and obscure; yet
from the first publication of it to <hi>Adam,</hi>
God in all Ages hath been amplifying the
privileges, and heightning the glory of this
second Covenant in all the after expressures
and editions of it unto this day, and will
more and more amplify and illustrate it to
the end of the World.</p>
                  <p>That first Promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. is like
the first small Spring or Head of a great
River, which the farther it runs, the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
it grows by the accession of more
Waters to it. Or like the Sun in the
Heavens, which the higher it mounts,
the more bright and glorious the day still
grows.</p>
                  <p>In that period of time, betwixt <hi>Adam</hi>
and <hi>Abraham,</hi> we find no token of God's
Covenant ordered therein to be applied
to the Infant-Seed of Believers. But in
that second Edition of the Covenant to
<hi>Abraham,</hi> the privileges of the Covenant
were amplified, and his Infant-Seed, not
only taken into the Covenant (as they
were before) but also added to the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church, by receiving the token of
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:54465:169"/>
the Covenant, which then was Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision;
and so here is a great addition
made to the visible Church, even the
whole Infant Off-spring of adult Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
                  <p>From that period, until the coming
of the <hi>Messiah</hi> in the flesh, the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Church, and their Infant-Seed, except
only some few Proselytes out of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Nations, made up the visible Church
of God, and the poor <hi>Gentiles</hi> were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Christ, being aliens from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
of <hi>Israel,</hi> and strangers from
the Covenants of Promise, having no
hope, and without God in the World,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 12. but in this glorious third
period, the Covenant again enlarges it
self more than before, and the Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of it are no longer limited and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Believers and their
Infant-Seed; but the <hi>Gentiles</hi> also are
taken into the Covenant, and the door of
Faith was opened unto them, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 27.
the partition-wall was now broken down,
which separated the Church from the
<hi>Gentile</hi> World, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 14. This was a
glorious enlargement of the Covenant,
and many glorious Prophecies and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
were fulfilled in it; such as those,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 10. and 42. 1, 6. 49. 22. 54. 3.
60. 3, 5, 11, 16. 62. 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="289" facs="tcp:54465:169"/>
And though the Covenant, as to its
external part, seems to have lost ground
in the breaking off of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation
from the Church; yet, like the Sea,
what it loses in one place, it gains with
advantage upon another; the addition
of many <hi>Gentile</hi>-Nations to the Church,
more than recompences for the present
breaking off of that one Nation of the
<hi>Iews.</hi> And indeed they are broken off
but for a time; for God shall Graff them
in again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 23. This therefore
being the design of God, and steddy
Course of his Covenant of Grace, more
and more to enlarge it self in all Ages;
nothing can be more opposite to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this Covenant, than to narrow
and contract its privileges in its farther
progress, and cut off a whole <hi>Species</hi> from
it, which it formerly took in.</p>

                  <p>It is past all doubt and contradiction,
that the Infant-Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> under
the second edition of the Covenant of
Grace, were taken with their believing
Parents into God's gracious Covenant,
had the Seal of that Covenant applied
to them, and were thereby added to the
visible Church, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:54465:170"/>
which was a gracious Privilege of the
Covenant superadded to all the former,
and such as sweeps away all the frivolous
and groundless cavils and exceptions of
those that object the incapacity of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
to enter into Covenant with God,
or receive benefit from the external pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
of the visible Church. Nor can
the subtilest enemy to Infants Baptism,
give us a convincing reason why the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
of <hi>Gentile</hi> Believers are not equally
capable of the same benefits that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
of <hi>Iewish</hi> Believers were, if they
still stand under the same Covenant that
the former stood under; and God hath
no where repealed the gracious Grant for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
made to the Infant-Seed of his
Covenant-people.</p>

                  <p>It is to me clear beyond all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,

                  <p>Suitably hereunto we find, that no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
was the Christian Church constituted,

to it; but the Children of such Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving

them, that the same Promise, <hi>viz. I

                  <p>We also find a Commission given by

To disciple all nations, baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c.
from which Discipleship, Infants ought
not to be excluded, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. Yea,
we find, that as at the institution of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
<hi>Abraham</hi> the Father and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Family was first circumcised
in his own person, and then his whole
houshold, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 23, 24. Answerably,
as soon as any person by Conversion, or
publick profession of Faith, became a
visible Child of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that person was
first Baptized, and the whole Houshold
with him or her, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 33. 15. 'Tis
unreasonable to put us upon the proof,
that there were Infants in those Houses;
it being more than probable, that in such
frequent Baptizing of Housholds belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

for us to prove from their foederal
holiness, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. and the extent of
God's Promise to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39.
If there had been never so many Infants
in those Housholds, they might and
ought to have been Baptized. How the

true sense and scope of the two last men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

not lay the stress of Infants Baptism up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such <hi>strictures</hi> as the Baptizings of the
Housholds of Believers, or Christ's ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
up in his Arms, and blessing the

These and many other such things found

what is the substantial part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace now, but the same it was
to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed before? Is not
this our Covenant of Grace, <hi>Heb. 8. 10.
I will be to them a God, and they shall be to
me a people?</hi> And in what words was
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant expressed, <hi>Gen. 17. 7.
I will establish my Covenant between me and
thee, and thy seed after thee in their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
for an everlasting Covenant, to be
a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee.</hi>
This makes <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Covenant, sealed
to him and his Seed, as truly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Covenant of Grace, as that which
Baptism now seals to Believers and their
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:54465:173"/>
Seed. The rash ignorance of those that
affirm, God may become a People's God
in the way of a special interest, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the broken and abolished Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of works, rather deserves sharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
and sad lamentation, than a
confutation; which, nevertheless out of
respect to my Friend Mr. <hi>Cary,</hi> I have
given it in its proper place in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder.</p>
                  <p>I hope by this time I have made it
evident, That the defenders of Infants
Baptism, as it is established upon God's
Covenant with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.
have not so mistaken their Ground, as
Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> hath, by his endeavours to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that Covenant as an <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Covenant
of Works,</hi> through such a multitude of
other errors and absurdities, as he draws
along with it in his way of reasoning.</p>

               <head>A Postscript to Mr. Cary.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Resolved not to disturb my mind
with your passionate provoking Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
at least whil'st I was busily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in searching for Reason and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
(two scarce Commodities) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
heaps of vain and fulsome words.
Nor will I now imitate your folly and
rudeness, lest I become an <hi>Offender,</hi>
whilst I am to act the part of a <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
When I read your Title, <hi>A Iust
and Sober Reply,</hi> and presently fell in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
rude insults, silly evasions, and
such inartificial discourses as follow in
your Book; I began to challenge you in
my thoughts, for matching such bad stuff
with so fair and lovely a <hi>Title:</hi> But a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
thought quickly corrected the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
for I considered no Man living
could justly forbid the Marriage betwixt
your Book and its Title, since there is not
the least kindred or relation between
them.</p>
               <p>Had your Answers been <hi>just,</hi> you
would have observed the Rules of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent,</hi>
which you have not done: And
if they had been <hi>sober,</hi> you had never
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:54465:174"/>
been so free in your reproaches, and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in your Arguments as you have been.
Is this the Man, of whom it is said in the
<hi>Epistle</hi> to his <hi>Solemn Call,</hi> That <hi>his Lines
are free from reflection and reproach
towards those of the perswasion he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
with?</hi> Is this my old friendly
Neighbour? It calls to my mind the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
Proverb, <hi>God keep us from our Friends,
and we will do what we can to keep our selves
from our Enemies.</hi> And though you act
the part of an Enemy, you shall be my
Friend whether you will or no. If you
will not be my Friend out of Love, I
will make you so by a good improvement
of your Hatred.</p>
               <p>I have been musing with my self, what
might be the true cause of all your rage
against my Book; One while I thought
it proceeded from want of <hi>discretion,</hi> that
you were not able to distinguish betwixt
an Adversary in a <hi>Controversie,</hi> and an
Adversary to the <hi>Person;</hi> but thought
every blow that was given to your Error,
must needs be a mortal wound to your
Reputation. But, Sir, how close and
smart soever my Discourses against your
Errors be, I'm sure they are more full of
civility and respect to you, than such a
<hi>Reply</hi> as you have made deserves: And
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:54465:174"/>
if in exposing your Errors, your Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
be expos'd, you must blame them
for occasioning it, and not me.</p>
               <p>Some times I thought it an effect of
your <hi>Policy,</hi> that when followed close,
and hard put to it, you endeavoured an
escape this way. <hi>Camero</hi> speaking of this
kind of subtilty in his Adversaries, saith,
<hi>Faciunt quod quarundam ferarum ingenium
est, ut foetore &amp; graveolenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Some cunning Animals, as Foxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
when pursued at the heels, drive away
both Dogs and Huntsmen with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
stench. And <hi>Hierom</hi> long ago
told <hi>Helvidius,</hi> his Adversary, <hi>Arbitror
te veritate convictum, ad maledicta con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verti;</hi>
being vanquished by Truth, he
betook himself to ill Language. After
the same manner you act here, being no
longer able to defend your self by solid
and sober ratiocination, you trust to
your faculty in crimination. Bad Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
only drive Men into such refuges.</p>
               <p>In a word, I am satisfied nothing but
your extravagant zeal for your Idolized
Opinion, could have thrown you into
such disingenuous Methods and Artifices
as these. The <hi>Ephesians</hi> were quiet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
till their <hi>Diana</hi> began to totter.
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:54465:175"/>
Your passionate Outcries signify to me,
something is touched to the quick, which
you are more fondly in love with than
you ought. When one told <hi>Luther</hi> what
hideous Out-cries his Enemies made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, and how they reviled
him in their Books: <hi>I know by their
roaring</hi> (said he) <hi>that I have hit them
right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You tell me in your <hi>Reply,</hi> p. 24.
That you perceive <hi>I have a mighty itch
to find out your Absurdities.</hi> I wish, Sir,
you were no more troubled with the itch
after them, than I am after the discovery
of them. Had I affected such Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
I could easily have gathered three
to one out of your Book, more than I
did: And have represented those I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd,
much more odiously (and yet
justly) than I did. But Friendship con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
me to handle them (because
yours) as gently as I could.</p>
               <p>I might have justly charg'd you from
what you say, <hi>p.</hi> 174, 175. of your <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Call:</hi> where you place all the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
on Earth, without exception of
any, under the Covenant of Works, as
a ministration of Death and Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and the severest Penalties of a
dreadful Curse: I might thereupon have
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:54465:175"/>
justly charg'd you for presenting to the
World such a monstrous Sight as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
seen before since the Creation, <hi>viz.</hi>
A whole Church of condemned and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Believers. This I might as well have
charged upon your Position, and done
it no wrong.</p>
               <p>I could tell you from what you say,
<hi>p.</hi> 76. of your Reply, <hi>That God doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
in the Covenant of Works make over
himself to Sinners, to be their God in a way
of special Interest; but it being upon such
hard terms, that it is utterly impossible that
way to attain unto life,</hi> &amp;c. I could justly
have told you, That these Passages of
yours, drop pure nonsense upon the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's
Understanding: as if Salvation were
impossible to be attain'd by the same Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
wherein God becomes our God,
and makes over himself by way of special
interest, to us.</p>
               <p>Had I had an itch to expose the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesque
and ridiculous Stuff, which lies
obvious enough in your Book; I should
then have told your Reader, That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your Doctrine, how opposite
and inconsistent soever the two Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of Works and Grace be, yet the
same Subjects, <hi>viz.</hi> Believers, may at
once, not only stand under them both,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:54465:176"/>
but that the same common Seal, <hi>viz.</hi> Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
equally ratifies and confirms
them both; for you allow in your <hi>Call,</hi>
p. 205. <hi>That it sealed the Covenant of
Grace to believing</hi> Abraham, <hi>and yet was
a Seal of the Covenant of Works,</hi> yea the
very condition of that Covenant, as you
frequently affirm it to be. <hi>Vide,</hi> p. 81.
of your <hi>Reply,</hi> and <hi>Passim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could as easily and justly have told
you, That the most malicious <hi>Papist</hi>
could scarcely have invented a more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Reproach against our famous Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
Protestant Divines, than you (I
dare not say maliciously, but) ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have done, when you charge such
men as Mr. <hi>Francis Roberts,</hi> Mr. <hi>Oba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah
Sedgwick;</hi> and indeed all that assert
the Law, complexly taken, to be an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurer
Covenant of Grace; that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
perfect doing with the consequent
Curse for non-performance; and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in Christ unto life and salvation in
one and the same Covenant. This is an
intolerable abuse of yours, <hi>p.</hi> 5. of your
<hi>Reply.</hi> They generally assert the Law,
in that complex sense and latitude you
take it, to be a true Covenant of Grace,
though more obscurely administred; and
that the distinction of the Covenants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:54465:176"/>
Old and New, is no parallel distinction
with that of Works and Grace, or <hi>Christ</hi>'s
and <hi>Adam</hi>'s Covenant. Your publick
recantation of the Injury you have done
the very Protestant Cause herein, is your
unquestionable duty, yet scarce a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of the Injury.</p>
               <p>In a word, I cannot but look upon it
as a discovery of your great weakness,
That when you meet with such a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
as poses your Understanding, and
you cannot possibly reconcile with your
Notion; as that of <hi>Paul</hi>'s circumcising
<hi>Timothy,</hi> and you affirming that the very
act of Circumcision did in its own nature
oblige all on whom it pass'd, to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
observation of the Law for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
You will rather chuse to leave
the blessed <hi>Apostle</hi> in a contradiction to
his own Doctrine, than to your vain No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
For what do you say, <hi>p.</hi> 95. of
your <hi>Reply? That however the case stood
in that respect, this is certain,</hi> &amp;c. It also
argues weakness in you to insist upon,
aggravate, jeer, and reproach at that
rate you do, <hi>p.</hi> 83. of your <hi>Reply.</hi> For the
mistake, and misplacing of one Figure,
<hi>viz. Gen.</hi> 12. for <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. as if the merit
of the whole Cause depended on it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:54465:177"/>
The like I may say of your charging me
with Nonsense, for putting <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8.
for <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 9, 10. when yet you your
self, <hi>p.</hi> 205. of your <hi>Call,</hi> tell us, That
Circumcision was appointed as a Sign or
Token of the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9.
What pitiful Trifles are these to raise
such a mighty triumph upon? When
<hi>Dureus</hi> accused our famous <hi>Whitaker</hi> for
one or two trivial verbal Mistakes, <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker</hi>
return'd him the same Answer I
shall give you, <hi>Benè habet, his in rebus
non vertuntur fortunae Ecclesiae.</hi> 'Tis well
the Case of the Church depends not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such Trifles.</p>
               <p>For a Conclusion; I do seriously w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

so destructive to the great Truths of the
Gospel as these are. And I do solemnly
profess, I have not designedly strained
them, to cast reproach upon him that
publish'd them; But the matters are so
plain, that if Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> will maintain
his Positions, not only my self, but every
intelligent Reader, will be easily able to
fasten all those odious Consequents upon
him, after all his Apologies.</p>

                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:54465:177"/>
Sir, in a word, I dare not say, but
you are a good Man; but since I read
your two Books, you have made me
Think more than once of what one said
of <hi>Ionah</hi> after he had read his History,
that he was a strange Man of a good
Man; yet as strange a good Man as you
are, I hope to meet you with a sounder

            <p>THE Design of the following
Sheets, cast in as a <hi>Mantissa</hi> to
the foregoing Discourse of <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi>
is principally to discharge and free
the Free-grace of God from those dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
Errors, which fight against it under
its own Colours; partly to prevent the
seduction of some that stagger; and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
(though least of all) to vindicate my
own Doctrine, the scope and current
whereof hath always been, and shall
ever be, to exalt the Free-grace of God
in Christ, to draw the vilest of Sinners<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But notwithstanding my utmost care
and caution, some have been apt to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
it, as if in some things it had a tang
of <hi>Antinomianism:</hi> But if my publick or
private Discourses be the faithful Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
of my Judgment and Heart, (as
I hope they are) nothing can be found in
any of them casting a friendly aspect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>The Scriptures foreseeing there would
arise such a sort of Men in the Church as
would wax wanton against Christ, and
turn his Grace into lasciviousness; hath
not only precautioned us in general to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of such Opinions as corrupt the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:54465:179"/>
Doctrine of Free-grace, <hi>Rom. 6. 1, 2.
Shall we continue in sin that grace may
abound? God forbid:</hi> but hath particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
indigitated and marked those very
Opinions by which it would be abused,
and made abundant provision against
them; as namely,</p>
               <p>1. All slighting and vilifying Opinions
or Expressions of the Holy Law of God,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7, 12.</p>
               <p>2. All Opinions and Principles inclining
men to a careless disregard and neglect of
the Duties of Obedience, under pretence
of Free-grace and Liberty by Christ,
<hi>Iam. 2. Matth.</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>3. All Opinions neglecting or slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sanctification as the evidence of our
Justification, and rendring it needless
or sinful to try the state of our Souls
by the Graces of the Spirit wrought
in us, which is the principal scope of the
First <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Iohn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, such is the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of some, and weakness of others,
that in all Ages (especially the last past,
and present) men have audaciously bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in upon the Doctrine of Free-grace;
and notoriously violated and corrupted it,
to the great reproach of Christ, scandal
of the World, and hardning of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:54465:180"/>
of Reformation. <hi>Behold</hi> (saith
<hi>Contzen</hi> the <hi>Iesuit</hi> on <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.) <hi>the
fruit of Protestantism, and their Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing is more opposite to looseness
than the Free-grace of God, which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us, <hi>That denying all ungodliness and
worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously,
and godly in this present world.</hi>
Nor can it without manifest violence be
made pliable to such wicked purposes.
And therefore the Apostle tells us, <hi>Iude</hi> 4.
That this is done by <hi>turning</hi> the Grace of
our Lord into lasciviousness: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
transferring it, scil. <hi>foedâ interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatione,</hi>
by a corrupt, abusive interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to such uses and purposes as it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors.
No such wanton, licentious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions
can be inferr'd from the Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctrines
of Grace and Liberty, but by
wresting them against their true scope
and intent, by the wicked Arts and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
of Deceivers upon them.</p>
               <p>The Gospel makes Sin more odious
than ever the Law did, and discovers the
punishment of it in a more severe and
dreadful manner, than ever it was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
before, <hi>Heb. 2. 2, 3. For if the
word spoken by Angels were stedfast, and
every transgression and disobedience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:54465:180"/>
a just recompence of reward; How
shall we escape if we neglect so great salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
It shews our obligations to duty,
to be stronger than ever; and our encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
to holiness greater than ever;
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. and yet corrupt Nature will
be still tempting men to corrupt and
abuse it. The more luscious the Food
is, the more men are apt to surfeit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
               <p>This perversion and abuse of Free-grace
and Christian-liberty, is justly
chargeable (though upon different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts)
both upon wicked, and good
Men. Wicked Men corrupt it design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
that by entitling God to their Sins,
they might sin the more quietly and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely.
So the Devil instigated the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
to sin against the Light and Law of
Nature, by representing their gods to
them as drunken and lascivious Deities.
So the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> and School of <hi>Simon,</hi>
and after them the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> and other
<hi>Hereticks,</hi> in the very dawning of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
Light and Liberty, began presently
to loose the bond of restraint from their
Lusts, under pretence of Grace and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
The <hi>Aetiani</hi> blushed not to
teach,<note place="margin">August. de Haeres. <hi>Tom. 6. Haeres.</hi> 54.</note> 
                  <hi>That Sin, and perseverance in
Sin, could hurt the Salvation of none,

so that they would embrace their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How vile and abominable Inferences
the <hi>Manichaeans, Valentinians,</hi> and <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donites,</hi>
drew from the Grace and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Gospel in the following
Ages, I had rather mourn over, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite.
And if we come down to the 15 <hi>th

                  <hi>Calvin</hi>
mournfully observes, That under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Christian-liberty, they trampled
all Godliness under foot. The vile Courses
their loose Opinions soon carried them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
plainly discovered for what intents and
purposes they were projected and calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated:
and he that reads the Preface to
that Grave and Learned Mr. <hi>Thomas Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker</hi>'s
Book, entituled, <hi>God's Eye upon
Israel,</hi> will find, That some <hi>Antinomians</hi>
of our days are not much behind the
worst and vilest of them. One of them
cries out, <hi>Away with the Law, away with
the Law, it cuts off a man's Legs, and
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n bids him walk.</hi> Another saith, <hi>Tis
as possible for Christ himself to sin, as for
a Child of God to sin. That if a man by
the Spirit know himself to be in the state of
grace, though he be drunk, or commit mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:54465:181"/>
God sees no sin in him:</hi> with
much more of the same Bran, which I
will not transcribe.</p>
               <p>But others there be, whose Judgments
are unhappily tainted and leavened with
these loose Doctrines; yet being in the
main godly persons, they dare not take
liberty to sin, or live in the neglect of
known duties, though their Principles too
much incline that way. But though
they dare not, others will, who imbibe
corrupt notions from them; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Piety of the Authors will be no
antidote against the danger, but make
the Poison operate the more powerfully,
by receiving it in such a vehicle. Now
it is highly probable such men as these
might be charmed into such dangerous
Opinions upon such accounts as these.</p>
               <p>(1.) 'Tis like some of them might
have felt in themselves the anguish of a
perplexed Conscience under sin; and
not being able to live with these terrors
of the Law, and dismal fears of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
might too hastily snatch at those
Doctrines which promise them relief and
ease, as I noted before in the 5th <hi>Cause</hi>
of my <hi>Treatise</hi> of <hi>Errors.</hi> And that this
is not a guess at random, will appear
from the very Title-page of Mr. <hi>Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marsh</hi>'s
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:54465:182"/>
                  <hi>marsh's</hi> Book of Free-grace, where (as
an inducement to the Reader to swallow
his <hi>Antinomian</hi> Doctrine) he shews him
this curious Bait. <hi>It is</hi> (saith he) <hi>an
experiment of Iesus Christ upon one who
hath been in the bondage of a troubled Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
at times for the space of about twelve
years, till now upon a clearer discovery of
Iesus Christ in the Gospel,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>(2.) Others have been induced to
espouse these Opinions from the excess of
their Zeal against the Errors of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,</hi>
who have notoriously corrupted
the Doctrine of Iustification by Free-grace;
decried <hi>imputed,</hi> and exalted <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berent</hi>
Righteousness above it. The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
have designedly and industriously
sealed up the Scriptures from the People,
lest they should there discover those sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
and effectual Remedies which God
hath provided for their distressed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
in the riches of his own Grace,
and the meritorious Death of Christ;
and so all their <hi>Masses, Pilgrimages, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular
Confessions,</hi> with all their dear
<hi>Indulgences,</hi> should lie upon their hands
as stale and cheap Commodities. <hi>Oh,</hi>
(said <hi>Stephen Gardiner) let not this gap

               <p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:54465:182"/>
But as soon as the Light of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had discovered the Free-grace of
God to Sinners, (which is indeed the
only effectual remedy of distressed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences)
and by the same Light the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Cheats of the Man of Sin were disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
all good men, who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened
by the Reformation, justly and
deeply abhorred <hi>Popery,</hi> as the Enemy
of the Grace of God, and true Peace of
Conscience, and fixed themselves upon
the sound and comfortable Doctrines of
Justification by Faith through the alone
Righteousness of Christ. Mean while
thankfully acknowledging, that they
which believe, ought also to maintain
good Works. But others there were,
transported by an indiscreet Zeal, who
have almost bended the Grace of God as
far too much the other way, and have
both spoken and written many things
very unbecoming the Grace of God,
and tending to looseness and neglect of
Duty.</p>
               <p>(3.) 'Tis manifest that others of them
have been ingulphed, and suckt into
those dangerous Quick-sands of <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi>
Errors, by separating the Spirit
from the written Word: If once a man
pretend the Spirit without the Scriptures
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:54465:183"/>
to be his Rule, whither will not his own
deluding Fancies carry him under a vain
and sinful pretence of the Spirit!</p>
               <p>In the Year 1528. when <hi>Helsar,
Traier</hi> and <hi>Seekler,</hi> were confuted by
<hi>Hallerus;</hi> and their Errors about Oaths,
Magistrates, and Paedo-baptism were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
by him, and by <hi>Colvius</hi> at <hi>Bern,</hi>
that which they had to say for themselves
was, That <hi>the Spirit taught them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than the letter of the Scriptures
speaks.</hi> So dangerous it is to separate what
God hath conjoined, and father our own
Fancies upon the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>(4.) And it is not unlike, but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
weakness and injudiciousness of
mind meeting with a fervent zeal for
Christ, and his Glory, may induce others
to espouse such taking and plausible, tho
pernicious, Doctrines. They are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of the dangerous Consequences of
the Opinions they embrace, and what
looseness may be occasioned by them. I
speak not of Occasions taken, but given,
by such Opinions and Expressions. A
good Man will draw excellent Inferences
of duty from the very same Doctrine.
Instance that of the shortness of time,
from whence the Apostle infers absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
strictness and diligence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:54465:183"/>
7. 29. but the <hi>Epicure</hi> infers all manner
of dissolute and licentious practices, <hi>Let
us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die,
1 Cor.</hi> 15 22. The best Doctrines are
this way liable to abuse.</p>
               <p>But let all good men beware of such
Opinions and Expressions as give an han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
to wicked men to abuse the Grace of
God, which haply the Author himself
dare not do, and may strongly hope o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
may not do: but if the Principle
will yield it, 'tis in vain to think corrupt
Nature will not catch at it, and make a
vile use, and dangerous improvement
of it.</p>
               <p>For example; If such a Principle as
this be asserted for a truth before the
World, <hi>That men need not fear that any,
or all the Sins they commit, shall do them
any hurt;</hi> let the Author, or any man in
the World warn, and caution Readers
(as the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Author of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
hath done) not to abuse this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, 'tis to no purpose. The Doctrine
it self is full of dangerous Consequents,
and wicked men have the best skill to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
and draw them forth to cherish and
countenance their Lusts: that which the
Author might design for the relief of the
distressed, quickly turns it self into poison
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:54465:184"/>
in the bowels of the wicked; nor can we
excuse it by saying any Gospel-truth may
be thus abused: for this is none of that
number; but a Principle that gives of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to the godly, and encouragement
to the ungodly. And so much as to the
rise and occasion of <hi>Antinomian Errors.</hi>

                  <p>I shall begin with the dangerous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
of the <hi>Antinomians</hi> in the Doctrine

                  <p>In two things however I must do the
<hi>Antinomians</hi> right. (1.) In acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging,
that though their Errors about
Justification be great and dangerous, yet
they are not so much about the <hi>substance,</hi>
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:54465:184"/>
as about the <hi>mode</hi> of a Sinner's Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
An Error far inferior to the Error
of the <hi>Papists,</hi> who depress the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ, and exalt their own
inherent Righteousness in the business of
Justification. (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.) I am bound in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to believe, that some among them
do hold those Errors but speculatively,
whilst the Truth lies nearer their hearts,
and will not suffer them to reduce their
own Opinions into practice. Now as to
their Errors about Justification, the most
that I have read do make <hi>Iustification to
be an immanent and eternal act of God;</hi>

                  <p>In this Breviate, or summary Account
of <hi>Antinomian</hi> Doctrines, I have only
singled out, and touched some of their
principal Mistakes and Error, into
which some of them run much farther
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:54465:186"/>
than others. But I look upon such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
to be in themselves of a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
nature, and the malignity and
contagion would certainly spread much
farther into the World than it doth, had
not God provided two powerful Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes
to resist the malignity.</p>
                  <list>

                     <item>1. The scope and current of Scripture.</item>
                     <item>2. The experience and practice of the Saints.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>(1.) These Doctrines run cross to the
scope and current of the Scriptures,
which constantly speak of all unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Persons (without exception of the
very Elect themselves, during that state)
as Children of wrath, even as others,
without Christ, and under condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</p>
                  <p>They frequently discover God's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and tell us his castigatory Rods of
affliction are laid upon them for their
Sins.</p>
                  <p>They represent Sin as the greatest
Evil; most opposite to the Glory of God,
and good of the Saints; and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
filled with Cautions and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
to prevent their sinning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="324" facs="tcp:54465:187"/>
They call the Saint frequently and
earnestly, not only to mourn for their Sins
before the Lord; but to pray for the
pardon or remission of them in the blood
of Christ.</p>
                  <p>They give us a far different account
of saving Faith, and do not place it in a
persuasion more or less of Christ's love to
us, or a manifestation in our Consciences
of the actual remission of our Sins before
we had a being; but in our receiving
Christ as the Gospel offers him, for
righteousness and life.</p>
                  <p>They frequently call the People of
God to the examination and trial of their
Interest in Christ by marks and signs;
and accordingly furnish them with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of such marks from the divers parts
or branches of Sanctification in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>They earnestly, and every-where, press
Believers to strictness and constancy in
the duties of Religion, as the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
God would have them to walk. They
infer Duties from Privileges; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Dialect is a wild
note, which the generality of serious
Christians do easily distinguish from the
Scripture-stile and Language.</p>

                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:54465:187"/>
(2.) The Experience and Practice of
the Saints recorded in Scripture, as well
as our Contemporaries, or those whose
Lives are recorded for our imitation, do
greatly secure us from the spreading ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
of <hi>Antinomianism.</hi> Converse
with the living, or read the Histories of
dead Saints, and you shall find, That in
their Addresses to God, they still bless
and praise him for that great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
change of state which was made
upon them when they first believed in
Christ, and on their believing passed
from death to life; freely acknowledging
before God, they were before their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
equal in sin and misery with the
vilest Wretches in the World: They
heartily mourn for their daily Sins; fear
nothing more than Sin; no Afflictions in
the World go so near their heart as Sin
doth. They mourn for the hardness of
their hearts, that they can mourn no
more for Sin. They acknowledge the
Rods of God that are upon them, are
not only the evidences of his displeasure
against them for their Sins; but the
fruits of their uneven walking with him.
And that the greatest of their Afflictions
is less than the least of their Iniquities
deserve. They fall at their Father's feet
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:54465:188"/>
as oft as they fall into sin, humbly and
earnestly suing for pardon through the
Blood of Christ. They are not only sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
that God sees Sin in them; but that
he seeth such, and so great evils in them, as
makes them admire at his patience that
they are not consumed in their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
They find cause enough to suspect
their own sincerity: doubt the truth of
their Faith, and of their Graces: and
are therefore frequent and serious in the
trial and examination of their own states
by Scripture-marks and signs. They
urge the Commands and Threatnings,
as well as the Promises, upon their own
hearts, to promote Sanctification. Excite
themselves to duty and watchfulness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Sin. They also encourage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by the rewards of obedience,
knowing their labour is not in vain in
the Lord. And all this while they look
not for that in themselves, which is only
to be found in Christ: nor for that in
the Law, which is only to be found in
the Gospel: nor for that on Earth, which
is only to be found in Heaven. This is
the way that they take. And he that
shall tell them, their Sins can do them
no hurt, or their Duties do them no
good, speaks to them, not only as a <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian,</hi>
                     <pb n="327" facs="tcp:54465:188"/>
in a Language they understand
not, but in such a Language as their
Souls detest and abhor.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, The zeal and love of
Christ, and his Glory, being kindled in
their Souls, they have not patience to
hear such Doctrines as so greatly dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
from his Glory, under a pretence of
honouring and exalting him. It wounds
and grieves their very hearts to see the
World hardned in their prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Reformation, and a gap opened
to all licentiousness.</p>
                  <p>But notwithstanding this double Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote

such Doctrines too much obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the professing World. For my
own part, He that searches my Heart
and Reins is witness, I would rather
chuse to have my right hand wither, and
my tongue rot within my mouth, than
to speak one word, or write one line to
cloud or diminish the Free-grace of God.

None owes more to it, or expects

is by them made clear to the

of it.</p>
                  <p>Justification may be considered under

(1.) According to God's Eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
and Purpose; and in this respect
Grace is said to be given us in Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the World began, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. And

<hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
                  <p>(2.) According to the execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

by considering it two ways:
<list>
                        <item>1. In its Impetration by Christ.</item>
                        <item>2. In its Application to us.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>That very mercy or privilege of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
which God from all Eternity,
purely out of his benevolent Love, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
and decreed for his Elect, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in time purchased for them by the
death of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 9, 10. where
we are said to be justified by his Blood;
and he is said to have made peace through
the Blood of his Cross, to reconcile all
things to himself, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
for our Offences, and raised again
for our Justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 25. Once
more, <hi>That God was in Christ, reconciling
the world unto himself, not imputing their
trespasses,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. God the Father
had in the death of Christ a foundation
of reconciliation, whereby he became
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:54465:190"/>
propitious to his Elect, that he might
absolve and justify them. Again,</p>
                  <p>(2.) It must be considered in its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to us, which application is made
in this Life at the time of our effectual
Calling. When an elect Sinner is united
to Christ by Faith, and so passeth from
Death to Life, from a state of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
into a state of Absolution and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
this is our actual Justification,
<hi>Rom. 5. 1. Acts 13. 39. Iohn</hi> 5. 24.
which actual Justification is again consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
two ways:
<list>
                        <item>1. Universally, and in General, as
to the State of the Person.</item>
                        <item>2. Specially, and Particularly, as to
the Acts of Sin.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>As soon as we are received into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with Christ, and his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is imputed by God, and received by
Faith, immediately we pass from a state
of Death and Condemnation, to a state
of Life and Justification, and all Sins al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
committed, are remitted without
Exception or Revocation; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
so, but a Remedy is given us in the
Righteousness of Christ against Sins to
come; and tho these special and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Sins we afterward fall into, do need
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:54465:190"/>
particular Pardons; yet, by renewed
Acts of Faith and Repentance, the
Believer applies to himself the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ, and they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned</p>
                  <p>Again, they carefully distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. It's Application by God to our
Persons. And</item>
                     <item>2. It's Declaration or Manifestation
in us, and to us.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Which Manifestation or Declaration,
is either,
<list>
                        <item>1. Private in the Conscience of a
Believer. Or,</item>
                        <item>2. Publick, at the Bar of Judgment.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>And thus Justification is many ways
distinguished. And notwithstanding all
this, it is still <hi>actus indivisus,</hi> an undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
act; not on our part, for it is ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
in many acts; but on God's part,
who at once decreed it; and on Christ's
part, who by one Offering purchased it,
and at the time of our Vocation univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
applied it, as to the state of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
justified; and that so effectually, as
no future Sin shall bring that Person any
more under Condemnation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="332" facs="tcp:54465:191"/>
In this Sentence or Judgment, the
Generality of Reformed Orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
are agreed; and the want of distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing,
(as they according to Scripture
have distinguished) hath led the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians</hi>
into this first Error about Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and that Error hath led them
into most of the other Errors. That
this Doctrine of theirs, (which teaches
that Men are justified actually and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly,
before they have a being) is an
Error, and hath no solid Foundation to
support it, may be evidenced by these
three Reasons.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Because it is Irrational.</item>
                     <item>2. Because it is Unscriptural.</item>
                     <item>3. Because it is Injurious to Christ,
and the Souls of Men.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>It is Irrational to imagine that Men are
actually justified,<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> before they have a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
by an immanent Act or Decree of
God. Many things have been urged
upon this account to confute and destroy
this Fancy, and much more may be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
urged against it. Let the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Particulars be weighed in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of Reason.</p>
                  <p>1. Can we rationally suppose, that
Pardon and Acceptance can be affirmed,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:54465:191"/>
or predicated of that which is not? Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
tells us, <hi>Non entis nulla sunt acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi>
That which is not, can neither be
condemned nor justified: But before the
Creation, or before a Man's particular
Conception, he was not, and therefore
could not in his own Person be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Justification. Where there is no
Law, there is no Sin: Where there is
no Sin, there is no Punishment: Where
there is neither Sin nor Punishment, there
can be no Guilt (for Guilt is an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Punishment). And where there's
neither Law, nor Sin, nor Obligation
to Punishment, there can be no Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
He that is not capable of a
Charge, is not capable of a Discharge.
What remains then, but that either the
Elect must exist from Eternity, or be
justified in time? 'Tis true, future Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
may be considered, as in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and decree of God from Eternity;
or as in the Intention of Christ, who
died intentionally for the Sins of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
and rose again for their Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But neither the Decree of God,
nor the Death of Christ, takes place up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any Man for his actual Justification,
until he personally exist. For the Object
of Justification is a Sinner actually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:54465:192"/>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5. but so no Man is, or
can be from Eternity. In Election, men
are considered without respect to Good
or Evil done by them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. not
so in actual Justification.</p>
                  <p>2. In Justification there is a Change
made upon the state of the Person, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.
8, 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11. By Justification men
pass from a state of Death to a state of
Life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 24. But the Decree or Purpose
of God in it self makes no such actual
change upon the state of any person. It
hath indeed the nature of an Universal
Cause; but an Universal Cause produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
nothing without particulars. If
our state be changed, it is not by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
act of God: Hence no such thing
doth <hi>transire.</hi> A mere <hi>velle non punire,</hi>
or intention to justify us in due time and
order, makes no change on our state,
till that time come, and the particular
Causes have wrought. A <hi>Prince</hi> may
have a purpose or intention to pardon a
Law-condemned <hi>Traitor,</hi> and free him
from that Condemnation in due time;
but whilst the Law that condemned him
stands in its full force and power against
him, he is not justified or acquitted,
notwithstanding that gracious intention,
but stands still condemned. So is it with
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:54465:192"/>
us, till by Faith we are implanted into
Christ. 'Tis true, Christ is a surety for
all his, and hath satisfied the debt. He
is a common Head to all his, as <hi>Adam</hi>
was to all his Children, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19.
But as the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> condemns none,
but those that are in him; so the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ actually justifies none
but those that are in him; and none are
actually in him, but Believers. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
till we believe, no actual change pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
or can pass upon our state. So
that this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> is contrary to <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As this Opinion is Irrational,<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> so it is
Unscriptural. For (1.) The Scripture fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
speaks of Remission or Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as a future act, and therefore not
from Eternity, <hi>Rom. 4. 23, 24. Now it
was not written for his sake alone, that it
was imputed to him; but for us also to
whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on
him,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Gal. 3. 8. The Scriptures
foreseeing that God would justify the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
through faith, preached before the
Gospel unto</hi> Abraham. The Gospel was
preached many years before the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
were justified: but if they were justified
from Eternity, how was the Gospel
preached before their Justification?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:54465:193"/>
(2.) The Scripture leaves all Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
without distinction, under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
and wrath. The Curse of
the Law lies upon them till they believe,
<hi>Iohn 3. 18. He that believeth on him, is not
condemned; but he that believeth not, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
already.</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3, 12, 13. The
very Elect themselves were by nature
the Children of wrath even as others.
They were at that time, or during that
state of nature (which takes in all that
whole space betwixt their conception
and conversion) without Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hope, without God in the World.
But if this Opinion be true, that the
Elect were justified from Eternity, or
from the time of Christ's death; then it
cannot be true, that the Elect by nature
are Children of Wrath, without Christ,
without Hope, without God in the
World; except these two may consist to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
(which is absolutely impossible)
that Children of Wrath, without God,
Christ, or Hope, are actually discharged
from their Sins and Dangers by a free and
gracious act of Justification.</p>
                  <p>But doth not the Scripture say,<note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
33. <hi>Who shall lay any thing to the charge
of God's Elect?</hi> If none can charge the
Elect, then God hath discharged them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:54465:193"/>
God hath not actually discharged
them as they are Elect,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> but as they are
justified Elect: for so runs that Text,
and clears it self in the very next words,
<hi>It is God that justifieth.</hi> When God hath
actually justified an Elect Person, none
can charge him.</p>
                  <p>(3.) 'Tis cross to the Scripture-order
of Justification; which places it not only
after Christ's death in the place last cited,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. but also after our actual vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
as is plain, <hi>vers. 30. Moreover,
whom he did predestinate, them he also cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
and whom he called, them he also ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified;
and whom he justified, them he also
glorified.</hi> Is it absurd to place Vocation
before Predestination, or Glorification
before Justification? sure then it must
be absurd also to place Justification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Vocation: the one as well as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confounds and breaks the Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.
You may as well say, men shall
be glorified, that were never justified; as
say they may be justified, before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
or existed. So that you see the
notion of Justification from Eternity, or
before our actual existence, and effectual
Vocation, is a notion as repugnant to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scripture, as it is to sound Reason.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="338" facs="tcp:54465:194"/>
And as it is found repugnant to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Scripture,<note place="margin">Reas. 3</note> so it is highly injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to Jesus Christ, and the Souls of
Men.</p>
                  <p>(1.) It greatly injures the Lord Jesus
Christ, and robs him of the glory of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Saviour. For if the Elect be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
from Eternity, Christ cannot be
the Saviour of the Elect, as most assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
he is: for if Christ save them, he
must save them as persons subject to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing,
either <hi>de facto,</hi> or <hi>de jure.</hi> But
if the Elect were justified from Eternity,
they could in neither respect be subject
to perishing: for he that was eternally
justified, was never condemned, nor ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of condemnation; and he that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was, or could be condemned, could
never be subject to perishing; and he that
never was, nor could be subject to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing,
can never truly and properly be
said to be saved.</p>
                  <p>If it be said, the Elect were not justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
till the death of Christ: I demand then
what became of all them that died before
the death of Christ? If they were not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
they could not be glorified:
for this is sure from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. That
the whole number of the glorified in
Heaven is made up of such as were justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:54465:194"/>
on Earth: Let men take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
lest under pretence of exalting
Christ, they bereave him of the glory of
being the Saviour of his Elect.</p>
                  <p>(2.) It bereaves him of another glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Royalty. The Scripture every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
makes our Justification the result
and fruit of the meritorious death of
Christ, <hi>Rom. 3. 24, 25. Rom.</hi> 8. 3, 4.
2 <hi>Cor. 5. 19, 20. Gal. 3. 13, 14. Eph.</hi> 1. 7.
But if men were justified from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
how is their Justification the
fruit and result of the blood of the
Cross? as it plainly appears from these
Scriptures to be. Nay,</p>
                  <p>(3.) This Opinion leaves no place for
the satisfaction of Justice by the Blood of
Christ for our Sins. He did not die, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this Opinion, to pay our
debts. And here <hi>Antinomianism</hi> and
<hi>Socinianism</hi> meet, and congratulate each
other. For if there were no debts owing
to the Justice of God from Eternity,
Christ could not die to pay them: and
'tis manifest there were no debts due to
God's Justice from Eternity on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his Elect, if the Elect were
from Eternity justified; unless you will
say, a person may be justified, and yet
his debts not paid: for all Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:54465:195"/>
dissolves the obligation to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>If there were any debts for Christ to
pay by his Blood, they must either be his
own debts, or the Elect's. To say they
were his own, is a blasphemous reproach
to him: and according to this Opinion
we cannot say they were the Elect's; for
if they were justified from Eternity,
their debts were discharged, and their
bonds cancell'd from Eternity. So that
this Opinion leaves nothing to the Blood
of Christ to discharge or make satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for.</p>
                  <p>(2.) And as it hath been proved to be
highly injurious to the Lord Jesus, so it
is greatly injurious to the Souls of men,
as it naturally leads them into all those
wild and licentious Opinions which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
flow from it, as from the radical
prolifique Error, whence most of the
rest derive themselves, as will immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately

                     <p>Because there be multitudes of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and justified Persons in the World,
who have no such manifestation, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:54465:196"/>
with strong fears and doubts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be so or no. There are but few
among Believers that attain such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion
and manifestation, as <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
make to be all that is meant in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
by Justification through Faith.
Many thousand new-born Christians live
as the new-born Babe, which neither
knows its own Estate, or Inheritance,
to which it is born,
<q>Vivit, &amp; est vitae nescius ipse suae.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>A Soul may be in Christ, and a justified
state, without any such persuasion or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation,
as they here speak of, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50.
10. And if any shall assert the contrary,
he will condemn the greatest part of the
Generation of God's Children. Now
that cannot be the saving and justifying
act of Faith, which is not to be found in
multitudes of believing and justified Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                     <p>But manifestation, or a personal persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the love of God to a Man's Soul,
or that Christ died for him, and all his
Iniquities are thereby forgiven him, is
not to be found in multitudes of believing
and justified Souls.</p>
                     <p>Therefore such a persuasion or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
is not that saving, justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:54465:196"/>
Faith, which the Scripture speaks
of.</p>
                     <p>That Faith which only justifies the
person of a Sinner before God, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be found in all justified Believers,
or else a man may be justified without the
least degree of justifying Faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
it is not Faith alone, by which
a man is justified before God.</p>

                     <p>That cannot be the justifying act of
Faith, which is not constant and abiding
with the justified Person, but comes and
goes, is frequently lost and recovered,
the state of the Person still remaining the
same. And such contingent things are
these persuasions and manifestations;
they come and go, are won and lost, the
state of the Person still remaining the
same. <hi>Iob</hi> was as much a justified Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
when he complained that God was
his Enemy, as when he could say, <hi>I
know that my Redeemer liveth.</hi> The
same may be said of <hi>David, Heman, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saph,</hi>
and the greatest number of justified
Believers recorded in Scripture. There
be two things belonging to a justified
state. (1.) That which is essential and
inseparable, to wit, Faith uniting the
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:54465:197"/>
Soul to Christ. (2.) That which is
contingent and separable, to wit, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and persuasion of our interest in
him. Those Believers that walk in
darkness, and have no light, have yet
a real special interest in God as their
God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 10. Here then you find
Believers without persuasion or manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
of God's love to them; which
could never be, if justifying Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in a personal persuasion, manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
or evidence of the love of God,
and pardon of Sin to a Man's Soul.
That cannot be the justifying Faith
spoken of in Scripture, which a justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Person may live in Christ with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and be as much in a state of
pardon and acceptation with God,
when he wants it, as when he hath
it. But such is persuasion, evidence,
or manifestation of a man's particular
interest in the love of God, or the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of his Sins. Therefore this is not
the justifying Faith the Scripture speaks
of.</p>

                     <p>That only is justifying, saving Faith,
which gives the Soul Right and Title to
Christ, and the saving benefits which
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:54465:197"/>
come by Christ upon all the Children of
God. Now it is not persuasion that
Christ is ours, but acceptance of him, that
gives us interest in Christ, and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
benefits and privileges of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, <hi>Iohn 1. 12. But as many
as received him, to them gave he power to
become the sons of God; even to them that
believe on his name.</hi> So that unless the
<hi>Antinomians</hi> can prove, that receiving of
Christ, and personal persuasion of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
be one and the same thing; and
consequently, that all Believers in the
World are persuaded or assured that their
sins are pardoned; and reject from the
number of Believers all tempted, desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
dark, and doubting Christians; this
persuasion they speak of, is not, nor can
it be the act of Faith, which justifies
the person of a Sinner before God. That
which I think led our <hi>Antinomians</hi> into
this Error, was an unfound and unwary
<hi>definition</hi> of Faith, which in their youth
they had imbibed from their <hi>Catechisms,</hi>
and other <hi>Systems,</hi> passing without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
or scruple in those days, which
though it were a mistake, and hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
been proved to be so in latter
days; yet our <hi>Antinomians</hi> will not part
with a notion so serviceable to the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:54465:198"/>
of their darling Opinion of Eternal
Justification.</p>

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:54465:198"/>
what hopes of Salvation they
have, and how they are founded? Their
common answer is, Christ died for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and that they are persuaded, that
whatever he hath done for any other, he
hath done it for them, as well as others:
But such a persuasion cometh not of him

                     <p>This Doctrine is certainly unfound,
because it confounds the distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Dogmatical, and Saving Faith; and
makes it all one, to believe an <hi>Axiom,</hi>

in Christ to Eternal Life. What is it
to believe, that God lay'd our iniquities
upon Christ, more than the mere assent
of the understanding to a Scripture <hi>Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om</hi>
or Proposition, without any consent
of the will to receive Jesus Christ as the

to the truth of Scripture Axioms and

What is this more than a Scripture-Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om

or Proposition, <hi>God lay'd the iniquity
of us all upon Christ,</hi> Isa. 53. 6? And yet
(saith Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> p. 296.) God cannot

this Truth, <hi>That God lay'd his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
upon Christ.</hi> The assent of the
understanding may be, and often is given
to a Scripture Proposition, whil'st the
Heart and Will remain carnal, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
averse to Jesus Christ. I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Dogmatically, that the iniquities
of Men were lay'd upon Christ, and
persuade my self presumptively, that
mine, as well as other Mens, were lay'd
upon him, and yet remain a perfect
Stranger to all saving Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion

                     <p>This Opinion cannot be true, because
it takes away the only support that bears
up the Soul of a Believer in times of
temptation and desertion.</p>
                     <p>For how will you comfort such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
Soul that saith, and saith truly,
I have no persuasion that Christ is mine,
or that my sins are pardoned; but I am
heartily willing to cast my poor sin-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened
Soul upon him, that he may be
mine; I do not certainly know that he
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:54465:199"/>
died intentionally for me, but I lye at his
feet, cleave to him, wait at the door of
hope; I stay and trust upon him, though
I walk in darkness, and have no light.
Now let such Doctrine as this be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a Soul in this condition, (and we
may be sure 'tis the condition of many
thousands belonging to Christ) I say,
bring this Doctrine to them, and tell
them, That unless they be persuaded of
the Love of God, and that God lay'd
their iniquities on Christ, except they
have some manifestation that their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
were justified from eternity, their
accepting of Christ, consent of their
Wills, waiting at his Feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> signifies
nothing; if they believe not that their
particular sins were lay'd upon Christ,
and are pardoned to them by him, they
are still unbelievers, and have no part or
portion in him. Whatever pretences of
spiritual comfort and relief the <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi>
Doctrine makes, you see by this, it
really deprives a very great, if not the

best and sweetest relief in days of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and spiritual distress. So that this
Doctrine, which makes manifestation
and assurance the very essence of justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

us. There's not a just Man upon earth,

<hi>In many things we offend all,</hi> James 3. 2.
The Scriptures plainly affirm it, and the
universal experience of all the Saints sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confirms it. 'Tis true, the Blood of
Christ hath taken away the guilt of Sin,
so that it shall not condemn Believers;
and the spirit of Sanctification hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away the dominion of Sin, so that
it doth not reign over Believers; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,

the existence of Sin in Believers.
The acts of sin are our acts, and not
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:54465:203"/>
Christ's, and the stain and pollution of
those sinful acts, are the burthens and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicities
of Believers, even in their justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
State. Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi> indeed, <hi>p.</hi> 270, 271.
calls that objection (I suppose he means
distinction betwixt the guilt of Sin and
Sin it self) a simple objection, and tells
us, the very Sin it self, as well as the guilt
of it, passed off from us, and was lay'd
upon Christ: So that speaking of the
Sins of Blasphemy, Murther, Theft,
Adultery, Lying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From that time
(saith he) that they were lay'd upon
Christ, thou ceasest to be a transgressor.
If thou hast part in the Lord Christ, all
these transgressions of thine become actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the transgressions of Christ. So that
now thou are not an Idolater, or Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
a Thief, a Murtherer, and an Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
thou art not a sinful person; Christ is
made that very sinfulness before God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Such expressions justly offend and grieve
the hearts of Christians, and expose Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
to scorn and contempt. Was it
not enough that the guilt of our sin was
lay'd on him, but we must imagine also,
that the thing it self, Sin, with all the
deformity and pollution should be essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
transferred from us to Christ? No,
no. After we are justified, sin dwelleth
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:54465:203"/>
in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17. warreth in us, and
brings us into captivity, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
and oppresseth our very Souls, <hi>v.</hi> 24.
Methinks I need not stand to prove
what I should think no sound experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
Christian dares to deny, that there
is much sin still remaining in the persons
of the justified. He that dares to deny
it, hath little acquaintance with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Sin, and of his own Heart.</p>
                     <p>(2.) It is neither true nor tolerable to
say there is no considerable evil in the sins
of Believers, deserving a mournful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
or petition for pardon. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
of Sin is Hell; 'tis an artifice of Satan
to draw men to Sin by persuading them
there is no great evil in it; but none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Fools will believe it. Fools, indeed,
make a mock of Sin; but all that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
either the intrinsick evil of it,
or the sad and dismal effects produced by
it, are far from thinking it a light or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
evil. The sins even of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
greatly wrong and offend their God,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 4. and is that a light thing with
us? They interrupt and clog our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 21. They
grieve the good Spirit of God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 30.
Certainly these are no inconsiderable mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="358" facs="tcp:54465:204"/>
(3.) Now if there be sin in Believers,
and so much evil in their sins (neither
of which any sober Christian will deny)
then undoubtedly it is their duty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
it freely, mourn for it bitterly, and
pray for the pardon of it earnestly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
God have any where discharged them
from those Duties, and told them these are
none of their concernments, and that he
expects not these things from justified
persons; but that these are Duties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
and only belonging to other Men.
But on the contrary, you find the whole
current of Scripture running strongly
and constantly in direct opposition to
such idle and sinful notions. For first,</p>
                     <p>(1.) He hath plainly declared it to be
his will, that his people should confess
their sins before him, and strongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
their Confessions with their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,
1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5. 9. and frequently su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spends
from them the comfortable sense
of forgiveness, till their Hearts be brought
to this duty, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 5. compared with
<hi>vers.</hi> 3. 4. the more to engage them to
this duty by the sensible ease and comfort
attending and following it.</p>
                     <p>(2.) He also enjoyns it upon them,
That they mourn for their Sins, <hi>Isa.</hi> 22.
12. expresses his great delight in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:54465:204"/>
and brokenness of spirit for sin,
<hi>Isa. 66. 2. To this man will I look, even to
him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit.</hi>
Christ himself pronounces a blessing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them that mourn, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 4. Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<hi>Paul</hi> mournfully confesses his former
blasphemies, persecutions and injuries
done against Christ, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. So
did <hi>Ezra, Daniel,</hi> and other eximious
Saints.</p>
                     <p>Yes, say some,<note place="margin">Object.</note> they did indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
their sins committed before their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
but not their after-sins.</p>
                     <p>According to <hi>Antinomian</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,<note place="margin">Reply.</note>
I would demand, If all the Elect
were justified from Eternity, what sins
any of them could confess which they
had committed before their Justification?
Or if they were justified from the time of
Christ's death, what were the Sins any
of us have to confess who had not a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and therefore had not actually sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
long after the death of Christ? But
I hope none will deny that the mournful
complaints the Apostle makes for Sin,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23, 24. were after he was a sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and justified person.</p>
                     <p>(3.) It is not the Will of Christ to
exempt any justified person upon Earth,
from the Duty of Praying frequently and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:54465:205"/>
fervently for the remission of his sins.
This the most eminent Saints upon Earth
have done. The greatest favourites of
Heaven have freely confessed and hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prayed for the remission of sin, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.
4, 19. And that the Gospel gives us no
exemption from this Duty, appears by
Christ's injunction of it upon all his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<hi>Matt.</hi> 6. 12.</p>

                     </list>
                     <p>'Tis true, and we thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it, that God sees no Sin in Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
as a Judge sees Guilt in a Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
to condemn him for it; that's a
sure and comfortable truth for us: but
to say he sees no Sin in his Children as a
displeased Father to correct and chasten
them for it, is an Assertion repugnant to
Scripture, and very injurious to God.
For,</p>
                     <p>(1.) 'Tis injurious to God's <hi>Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
Psal. 139. 2. <hi>Thou</hi> (saith holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid)
knowest my down-sitting, and my up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising,
and understandest my thoughts of afar
off, and art acquainted with all my ways.</hi>
Job 28. 24. <hi>He looketh to the ends of the
Earth, and seeth under the whole Heavens.</hi>
Prov. 15. 3. <hi>The Eyes of the Lord are in
every place, beholding the evil and the

his habitation he looketh upon all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:54465:206"/>
of the Earth; he fashioneth their
hearts alike, he considereth all their works.</hi>
He that denies that God seeth his most
secret Sins, therein in consequentially denies
him to be God.</p>
                     <p>(2.) This Assertion is inconsistent
with God's Providential Dispensations to
his People. When <hi>David,</hi> a justified
Believer, had sinned against him in the
matter of <hi>Vriah,</hi> it is said, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.
27. <hi>The thing that</hi> David <hi>had done, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
the Lord:</hi> and as the effect of that
displeasure, it's said, <hi>Chap. 12. 15. The
Lord struck the Child that</hi> Uriah's <hi>Wife
bare unto</hi> David, <hi>and it was very sick.</hi>
Among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> some that should
not be condemned with the World, were
judged and chastened of the Lord for
their undue approaches to his Table,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32. Now I would ask the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian</hi>
these two Questions. (1. <hi>Qu.</hi>)
Whether it can be denied, that <hi>David</hi>
under the Old Testament, and these <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi>
under the New, were justified
Persons; and yet the former stricken by
God in his Child, with its sickness and
death; and the latter in like manner
smitten by God in their own persons;
and both for their respective sins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
against God; and yet God saw
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:54465:206"/>
no sin in them? Did God smite them for
sin, and yet beheld no sin them? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
lest in ascribing such strokes to god,
you strike at once both at his Omniscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Justice. (2. <hi>Qu.</hi>) How God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Confession and Repentance can be
said to put away his People's sins (as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
there assures <hi>David</hi> he had done)
when in the mean time he saw no sin in
him, either to chastise him for, or to
pardon in him? Do you think that God's
A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>flictions or Pardons are blind-fold Acts,
done at random? how inconsistent is this
with Divine Dispensations?</p>
                     <p>(3.) This Opinion is altogether desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of a Scripture-foundation: 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
it hath none in the only places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
for it. It hath no footing at all
in <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 21. Grave and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Gataker</hi> hath learnedly and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
vindicated that Scripture from this
abuse of it by <hi>Antinomians,</hi> in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
upon that Text, entitled, <hi>God's Eye
upon</hi> his Israel; where after a learned and
critical search of the Text, he telleth us,
it soundeth word for word thus from the
Original: <hi>He hath not beheld wrong against</hi>
Jacob, <hi>nor hath he seen grievance against</hi>
Israel: So that the meaning is not, That
God did not see sin in <hi>Israel,</hi> but that he
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:54465:207"/>
beheld not with approbation the wrongs
and injuries done by others against
his <hi>Israel;</hi> and shews at large by divers
solid Reasons, why the <hi>Antinomian</hi> sense
cannot be the proper sense of that place,
it being cross to the main tenour of the
Story, and truth of God's Word, which
shews, that God often complained of their
Sins, often threatned to avenge them;
yea, did actually avenge them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
them in the Wilderness; nay,
<hi>Balaam</hi> himself, who uttered these words
unto <hi>Balak,</hi> did not so understand them,
as appears by the advice he gave to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lak,</hi>
to draw them into sin, that thereby
God might be provoked to withdraw his
protection from them.</p>
                     <p>And for <hi>Ier.</hi> 50. 20. it makes nothing
to their purpose. Many expound the sin
there sought after, and not found, to be
the Sin of Idolatry, which <hi>Israel</hi> should
be purged from by their Captivity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 9. But the generality
of sound Expositors are agreed, That by
the not finding of <hi>Israel</hi>'s and <hi>Iudah</hi>'s Sin,
is meant no more, but his not finding
those Bonds or Obligations against them
to eternal punishment, which their Sins
had put them under.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="365" facs="tcp:54465:207"/>
(4.) In a word, This Opinion clashes
with their other Principles. For they
say, That though there was pardon and
remission under the Old Covenant (which
they allowed to be a Covenant of Grace)
yet it was but <hi>gradatim</hi> and successively,
as they offered Sacrifices. If a man had
sinned ignorantly, until he brought a
Sacrifice, his sin lay upon him, it may be
a week, a months distance between, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could have their pardon. <hi>Vide</hi>
Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi> of the two Covenants, <hi>p.</hi> 256,
257. Now I demand, If this were the
state and case of all God's <hi>Israel</hi> under the
Old Testament, Why do these men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that God can see no sin in a Believer?
and why do they expound the words of
<hi>Balaam</hi> so contradictorily to this their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Opinion? For they will not deny but
God sees unpardoned Sins in all; and here
is a week, or month, or more time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
between the commission and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of their Sin. And so much of
the <hi>5th Antinomian</hi> Error.</p>

               </div>
               <div n="6" type="section">
                  <head>Error VI.</head>
                  <p>That God is not angry with the Elect,
nor doth he smite them for their Sins;
and to say that he doth so, is an injurious
reflection upon the Iustice of God, who hath
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:54465:208"/>
received full satisfaction for all their Sins
from the hand of Christ.</p>
                  <p>There are several Mistakes and Errors
in these Assertions; and I suppose our
<hi>Antinomians</hi> were led into them, (1.) By
their abhorrence of the Popish Doctrine,
which errs more dangerously in the other
extream: for they wickedly assert our
Sufferings to be satisfactory for our Sins,
which is the ground of Popish Penances,
and voluntary Self-castigations. (2.) From
a groundless apprehension, That God's
Corrections of us for our Sins, are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the fulness of Christ's satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for them. Christ having paid all
our Debts, and dissolved our Obligations
to all punishment, it cannot consist with
the Justice of God to lay any Rod upon
us for our Sins after Christ hath born all
that our Sins deserved.</p>
                  <p>This mistake of the end of Christ's
death, occasions them to stumble into the
other Mistakes: they imagine that
Christ's Satisfaction abolished God's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of Sin in Believers. But this cannot
be; God's antipathy to Sin, can never be
taken away by the Satisfaction of Christ,
though his hatred to the Persons of the
redeemed be: for the hatred of Sin is
founded in the unchangeable Nature of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:54465:208"/>
God; and he can as soon cease to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as cease to hate Sin, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 13. Nor
was Christ's death ever designed to this
end: though Christ hath satisfied for the
Sins of Believers, God still hates Sin in
Believers. His hatred to their Sins, and
love to their Persons, are not inconsistent.
As a man may love his Leg or Arm, as
they are Members of his own Body, and
notwithstanding that love, hate the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene
which hath taken them; and lance
or use painful corrosives for the cure of
them.</p>
                  <p>Neither do our <hi>Antinomians</hi> distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
as they ought, betwixt vindictive
Punishments from God, the pure issues
and effects of his Justice and Wrath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Wicked; and his Paternal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigations,
the pure issues of the Care and
Love of a displeased Father. Great and
manifold are the differences betwixt his
vindictive Wrath upon his Enemies, and
the rebukes of the Rod upon his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Those are Legal, these Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
Those out of wrath and hatred,
these out of love. Those unsanctified,
but these blessed and sanctified to happy
ends and purposes to his People. Those
for destruction, these for salvation.</p>

To narrow the matter in Controversy
as much as we can, I shall lay down three
Concessions about God's Corrections of
his People.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="subsection">
                     <head>Concession I.</head>
                     <p>We chearfully and thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the perfection and fulness of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of Christ for all the Sins of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers:
and with thankfulness do own,
that if God should cast all, or any of
them, into an ocean of temporal Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and Distresses; in all that sea of
Sorrow, there would not be found one
drop of vindictive Wrath. Christ hath
drunk the last drop of that Cup, and left
nothing for Believers to suffer by way of
satisfaction.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="2" type="subsection">
                     <head>Concession II.</head>
                     <p>We grant also, That all the Sufferings
of Believers in this World, are not for
their Sins; but some of them are for the

the tryal of their Graces, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 2, 3.
some for a confirming testimony to his

these have much heavenly comfort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant

                     <head>Concession III.</head>
                     <p>We do not say, That God's displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
with his People for Sin, evidenced
against them in the smartest rebukes of
the Rod, is any argument that God's love
is turned into hatred against their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:
no, no, his love to his People is
unchangeable. Having loved his own,
he loved them to the end, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 1.
yet notwithstanding all this, three things
are undeniably clear, and being through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apprehended, will end this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That God lays his correcting Rod
in this World on the Persons of
Believers.</item>
                        <item>2. That this Rod of God is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
laid on them for their Sins.</item>
                        <item>3. That these Fatherly Corrections
of them for their Sins, are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
to, and fully consistent
with his Justice, compleatly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Blood of Christ for all
their Sins.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>1. That God lays his correcting Rod
in this World upon the persons of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
This no man can have the face
to deny that believes the Scriptures to be
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:54465:210"/>
the Word of God, or that the Troubles
of good men in this life fall not out by
casualty, but by the counsel and direction
of Divine Providence. He that denies
the hand of God to be upon the Persons
of Believers in this life in the way of
painful Chastisements and Sufferings,
must either ignorantly, or wilfully, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
that Scripture, <hi>Heb. 7. 8. What Son
is he whom the Father chasteneth not? but
if ye be without chastisement, whereof all
are partakers, then are ye Bastards, and
not Sons.</hi> Nor will any sober Christian
deny these Troubles of Believers to be the
effects of God's governing-Providence in
the World, or once imagine or affirm
them to be mere Casualties and Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences:
for <hi>affliction cometh not forth of
the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of
the ground,</hi> Job 5. 6. In what <hi>Eutopia</hi>
doth that good man live upon Earth,
that feels not the painful Rod of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himself, nor hears the sad laments and
moans of other Christians under it!
This sure is undeniable, that the Rod
of God is every-where upon the Persons
and Tabernacles of the Righteous; and
if any doubt it, his own sense and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may in a little time give him a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
demonstration of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="371" facs="tcp:54465:210"/>
2. And for the second, That this Rod
of God is sometimes laid upon Believers
for their Sins, methinks no sober modest
Christian in the World should doubt, or
deny it, when he considers, That
<list>
                           <item>1. God himself hath so declared it.</item>
                           <item>2. The Saints in all Ages have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

12, 13, 14. <hi>Wherefore hast thou despised

own heart, and that expresly for his Sin
in the matter of <hi>Vriah.</hi> So <hi>Moses,</hi> one
of the greatest Favourites of Heaven, for
his sinful shifting of the Lord's Work,
<hi>Exod. 4. 13, 14. The anger of the Lord
was kindled against</hi> Moses: <hi>For the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of thine iniquities, because thy sins
were encreased, I have done these things
unto thee,</hi> saith God to his own <hi>Israel,
Ier.</hi> 30. 15. To instance in all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
made by God himself in this
case, were to transcribe a great part of
both Testaments.</p>

                        <pb n="372" facs="tcp:54465:211"/>
2. And as God hath declared the Sins
of his People to be the provoking causes
of his rods upon them; so they have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ingenuously confessed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
the same, <hi>Lam. 3. 39, 40.
Wherefore doth the living man complain?
a man for the punishment of his Sins? Let
us search and try our ways, and turn again
to the Lord.</hi> This was spoken by <hi>Ieremy</hi>
in the name of the whole captive Church.
So <hi>Psal. 38. 3, 5. There is no soundness
in my flesh</hi> (saith <hi>David) because of thine
anger; neither is there any rest in my bones,
because of my Sin. My wounds stink, and
are corrupt, because of my foolishness.</hi> And
were it not an hideous and unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thing to hear any Child of God, under
his Rod, to stand upon his own justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and say, Lord, my Sins have not
deserved this at thy hand, nor is it justice
in thee thus to chastise me after thou hast
received satisfaction for all my Sins from
the hand of Christ. Would it not look
like an horrid Blasphemy, to hear the
best man in the World disputing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the Justice of God in the troubles
he lays him under? For my own part, let
the Lord lay on as smartly as he will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, I desire to follow the holy Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns
and Presidents recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:54465:211"/>
for my imitation, and to say with
the People of God, <hi>Ezr. 9. 13. Thou hast
punished me less than mine iniquities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</hi>
And <hi>Mica 7. 9. I will bear the
indignation of the Lord, because I have
sinned against him.</hi> And he that refuses
so to do, gives little evidence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Adoption in him, but a very clear
evidence of the pride and ignorance of
his own heart. <hi>Iob</hi> indeed stifly stood
upon his own vindication; but that was
when he had to do with men, who falsly
charged him, laying those Sins as the
causes of his trouble, which he was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
of, <hi>Iob</hi> 22. 5, 6. But when he had
to do with God, he disputes no more, but
saith, <hi>Behold, I am vile, what shall I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
thee? I will lay my hand upon my
mouth. q. d.</hi> I have done, Father, I have
done; Whether these Chastisements be
for my Sins or no, sure I am, my Sin not
only deserves all this, but Hell it self:
Thou art holy, but I am vile.</p>
                     <p>3. Nor can it at all be doubted, but
that these Fatherly Corrections of the
Saints for their Sins, are reconcileable to,
and fully consistent with his Justice, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
by the Blood of Christ for all their
Sins. For (1.) If it were not so, the
just and righteous God would never have
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:54465:212"/>
inserted such a clause of reservation in
his gracious Covenant with his People,
to chasten them as he saw need, after he
had taken them into the Covenant, <hi>Psal.
89. 30, 31, 32, 33. If they transgress, he
will visit their Transgressions with a Rod,
and their Iniquity with Stripes; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless</hi>
(saith he) <hi>my loving-kindness will
I not take away.</hi> That [<hi>Nevertheless</hi>]
clearly proves the consistency of his
stripes for sin, with his loving-kindness
to his People, and with Christ's satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for their Sins. (2.) If this were
not consistent with the Justice of God, to
be sure he would never single them out
to spend his Rods upon, rather than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
'Tis most certain the holiest men
have most lashes in this life. <hi>Asaph</hi> said,
<hi>Psal. 73. 12, 14. The ungodly prosper in the
World, but he was chastned every morning.</hi>
And <hi>vers. 5. The Wicked are not in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as other men.</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 17. <hi>Iudgment
must begin at the House of God;</hi> and if
Piety would give men an exemption
from all troubles, pains, and chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
then men might discern love or
hatred by the things that are before
them, contrary to <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 1, 2. Neither
could those that are in Christ suffer the
painful Agonies of Death because of sin,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:54465:212"/>
expresly contrary to <hi>Paul, Rom. 8. 10.
And if Christ be in you, the Body is dead
because of sin.</hi> (3.) In a word, As Christ
never shed his Blood to extinguish or
abolish God's displeasure against sin in
whomsoever it be found, so he never
shed it to deprive his People of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
blessings and advantages that accrue
to them by the Rods of God upon them.
It was never his intent to put us into a
condition on Earth, that would have
been so much to our loss. So then, if
the hand of God be upon his People for
sin, and consistently enough with his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
it must be an Error to say, God
smites not Believers for their sins, and it
would be injustice in him so to do, which
is their 6th Error.</p>

and punishment of sin was laid upon Christ;
but simply the very faults that men commit,

                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>Refutation.</head>
                     <p>These two Propositions will never go
down with sound and Orthodox Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
The first sinks and debases Christ
too low, the other exalts the sinful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
too high. The one represents the
pure and spotless Lord Jesus as sinful:
the other represents the sinful Creature
as pure and perfect: and both these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
seem evidently to be built upon
these two Hypotheses. (1.) <hi>That the
righteousness of Christ is subjectively and
inherently in us, in the same fulness and
Perfection it is in Christ:</hi> grant that, and
then it will follow indeed, That Christ
himself is not more righteous than the
Believer is. (2.) <hi>That not only the guilt
and punishment of sin was laid on Christ by
way of imputation; but sin it self, the very
transgression, or sinfulness it self, was
transferr'd from the Elect to Christ: and
that by God's laying it on him, the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
or fault it self was essentially
transfused into him; and so sin it self
did</hi> transire à subjecto in subjectum.
Grant but this, and it can never be
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:54465:213"/>
denied but Christ became as compleatly
sinful as we.</p>
                     <p>But both these Hypotheses are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
notoriously false, but utterly impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as will be manifested by and by;
But before I come to the Refutation of
them, it will be necessary to lay down
some Concessions to clear the Orthodox
Doctrine in this Controversie, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the matter under debate, as much as
may be.</p>
                     <p>(1.) And first we thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Lord Jesus Christ to be the
<hi>Surety</hi> of the New Testament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.
22. and that as such, all the Guilt and
Punishment of our Sins, was laid upon
him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 5, 6. That is, God impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and he bare it in our room and stead.
God the Father, as Supreme Law-giver,
and Judge of all, upon the Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Law, admitted the Sponsion
or Suretiship of Christ, to answer for
the sins of men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7. And
for this very end he was made under the
Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4, 5. And that Christ vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
took it upon him to answer as
our <hi>Surety,</hi> whatsoever the Law could
lay to our charge; whence it became
just and righteous that he should suffer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="378" facs="tcp:54465:214"/>
(2.) We say, That God by laying upon,
or imputing the Guilt of our Sins to
Christ, thereby our Sins became legally
his; as the Debt is legally the Sureties
Debt, tho he never borrowed one far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it: Thus God laid, and Christ
took our Sins upon him, tho in him was
no sin, 2 Cor. 5. 21. <hi>He hath made him
to be sin for us, who knew no sin</hi> (i. e.)
who was clean and altogether void of
sin.</p>
                     <p>(3.) We thankfully acknowledg, that
Christ hath so fully satisfied the Law for
the sins of all that are his, that the Debts
of Believers are fully discharg'd, and the
very last mite paid by Christ. His Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is full, and so therefore is our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
and Acquittance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 31.
And that by virtue hereof the Guilt of
Believers is so perfectly abolished, that it
shall never more bring them under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 24. And so in Christ
they are without fault before God.</p>
                     <p>(4.) We likewise grant, That as the
Guilt of our Sins was by God's Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
laid upon Christ, so the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ is by God imputed to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
by virtue of their Union with
Christ; and becomes thereby as truly and
fully <hi>theirs,</hi> for the justification of their
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:54465:214"/>
particular Persons before God, as if they
themselves had in their own Persons ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
all that the Law requires, or suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all that it threatned: No inherent
Righteousness in our own Persons, is, or
can be more truly our own for this end
and purpose, than Christ's imputed
Righteousness is our own. He is the Lord
<hi>our Righteousness,</hi> Jer. 23. 6. <hi>We are
made the righteousness of God in him,</hi>
1 Cor. 5. 21. <hi>Yea, the righteousness of the
Law is fulfilled in them that believe,</hi> Rom.
8. 4.</p>
                     <p>But notwithstanding all this, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say, (1.) That Christ became as
compleatly sinful as we. Or (2.) That
we are as compleatly righteous as Christ;
and that over and above the Guilt and
Punishment of Sin, (which we grant
was laid upon Christ) Sin it self simply
considered, or the very Transgression it
self, became the Sin or Transgression of
Christ; and consequently that we are as
compleatly Righteous as Christ, and
Christ as compleatly Sinful as we are.</p>
                     <p>1. We dare not say, That Sin simply
consider'd, as the very Transgression of
the Law it self, as well as the Guilt and
Punishment, became the very Sin and
Transgression of Christ: For two things
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:54465:215"/>
are distinctly to be considered and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced,
With respect to the Law, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Sin. As to the Law, we are to consider
in it,
<list>
                           <item>1. Its Preceptive part.</item>
                           <item>2. Its Sanction.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>(1.) The preceptive part of the Law,
which gives Sin its formal Nature, 1 <hi>Ioh.
3. 4. For sin is the transgression of the
law.</hi> All Transgression arises from the
Preceptive part of the Law of God: He
that transgresseth the Precepts, sinneth;
and under this consideration sin can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be communicated from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
The Personal sin of one cannot
be in this respect the Personal sin of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
There is no Physical Transfusion
of the Transgression of the Precept from
one subject into another: This is utterly
impossible; even <hi>Adam</hi>'s personal sins
consider'd in his single private capacity,
are not communicable to his Posterity.</p>
                     <p>(2.) Besides the Transgression of the
Preceptive part of the Law, there is an
obnoxiousness unto Punishment, arising
from the Sanction of the Law, which
we call the Guilt of Sin; and this (as Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> observes) is separable
from sin:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Owen</hi> of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 285.</note> And if it were not separable
from the former, no sinner in the world
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:54465:215"/>
could either be pardoned or sav'd: Guilt
may be made another's by Imputation,
and yet that other not rendred formally a
sinner thereby: Upon this ground we say,
the Guilt and Punishment of our Sin,
was that only which was imputed unto
Christ; but the very Transgression of
the Law it self, or Sin formally and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
consider'd, could never be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
or transfused from us into
him. I know but two ways in the world
by which one man's sins can be imagined
to become another's, viz. Either by <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,</hi>
which is Legal, and what we
affirm; or by <hi>Essential Transfusion</hi> from
subject to subject (as our Adversaries
fancy) which is utterly impossible; and
we have as good ground to believe the
absurd Doctrine of Transubstantiation,
as this wild notion of the Essential
Transfusion of Sin. Guilt arising from
the Sanction of the Law, may and did
pass from us to Christ by Legal Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but sin it self, the very Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
it self, arising from the very Precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
part of the Law, cannot so pass from
us to Christ: For if we should once ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that the very acts and habits of sin,
with the odious deformity thereof, should
pass from our Persons to Christ, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:54465:216"/>
to inhere in him, as they do in
us; then it would follow,</p>
                     <p>First, That our Salvation would
thereby be rendred utterly impossible.
For such an inhesion of Sin in the Person
of Christ, is absolutely inconsistent with
the <hi>Hypostatical Vnion,</hi> which Union is
the very Foundation of his Satisfaction,
and our Salvation. Tho the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
can, and doth dwell in Union with
the pure and Sinless human Nature of
Christ, yet it cannot dwell in Union
with Sin.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, This Supposition would
render the Blood of the Cross altogether
unable to satisfie for us. He could not
have been the Lamb of God to take away
the Sins of the World, if he had not been
perfectly pure and spotless, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Had our Sins thus been es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially
transfus'd into Christ, the Law
had had a just and valid Exception against
him; for it accepts of nothing but what
is absolutely pure and perfect. I admire,
therefore, how any good Man dares to call
our Doctrine which teaches the Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Guilt and Punishment to Christ,
a simple Doctrine; and assert, that the
Transgression it self became Christ's; and
that thereby Christ became as compleatly
sinful as we. And,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="833" facs="tcp:54465:216"/>
Fourthly, If the way of making our
Sins Christ's by imputation, be thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
and derided; and Christ asserted
by some other way to become as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
sinful as we; then I cannot see
which way to avoid it, but that the
very same Acts and Habits of Sin must
inhere, both in Christ, and in Believers
also. For, I suppose our Adversaries
will not deny that, notwithstanding God's
laying the Sins of Believers upon Christ,
there remain in all Believers after their
Justification, sinful Inclinations and Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations;
a Law of Sin in their Members,
a Body of Sin and Death. Did these
things pass from them to Christ, and
yet do they still inhere in them? Why
do they complain and groan of in-dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Sin? as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. If Sin it self be so
transferr'd from them to Christ? Sure,
unless Men will dare to say, the same
Acts and Habits of Sin which they feel
in themselves, are as truly in Christ as
in themselves; they have no ground to
say, that by God's laying their Iniquities
upon Christ, he became as compleatly
sinful as they are; and if they should so
affirm, that Affirmation would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the very Foundation of their own
Salvation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="384" facs="tcp:54465:217"/>
I therefore heartily subscribe to that
sound and holy Sentence, of a clear and
learned Divine,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Owen,</hi> Of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, p. 283.</note> 
                        <hi>Nothing is more absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true, nothing more sacredly and assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believ'd by us, than that nothing which
Christ did or suffer'd, nothing that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook,
or underwent, did, or could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
him subjectively, inherently, and
thereupon personally a Sinner, or guilty of
any Sin of his own. To bear the Guilt or
Blame of other Mens Faults, to be</hi> alienae
culpae reus, <hi>makes no Man a Sinner, unless
he did unwisely or irregularly undertake it.</hi>
So, then this Proposition, that by God's
laying our Sins upon Christ (in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, than by Imputation of Guilt
and Punishment) he became as compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sinful as we, will not, ought not to be
receiv'd as the sound Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
Nor yet this</p>

                  <div type="subsection">
                     <head>Second Proposition.</head>
                     <p>That we are as compleatly Righteous as
Christ is; or, that Christ is not more Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than a Believer.</p>
                     <p>I cannot imagine what should induce
any Man so to express himself, unless it
be a groundless conceit and fancy, that
there is an essential Transfusion of
Christ's justifying Righteousness into Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:54465:217"/>
whereby it becomes theirs by
way of subjective inhesion, and is in
them in the very same manner it is in
him: And so every individual Believer
becomes as compleatly Righteous as
Christ. And this conceit they would
fain establish upon that Text, 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 7.
He that doth righteousness, is righteous,
even as he is righteous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But neither this expression, nor any
other like it in the Scriptures, gives the
least countenance to such a general and
unwary Position. It is far from the
mind of this Scripture, That the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ is formally and inherent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ours, as it is his. Indeed it is ours
<hi>relatively,</hi> not <hi>formally</hi> and <hi>inherently;</hi>
not the same with his for <hi>quantity,</hi> though
it be the same for <hi>verity.</hi> His Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
is not ours in its <hi>Vniversal va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,</hi>
though it be ours, as to our <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
use and necessity.</hi> Nor is it made ours
to make us so many <hi>causes</hi> of Salvation to
others; but it is imputed to us as to the
<hi>Subjects,</hi> that are to be saved by it our
selves.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, we are justified, and saved
by the very Righteousness of Christ, and
no other; but that Righteousness is <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
inherent</hi> in him only, and is only
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:54465:218"/>
                        <hi>materially</hi> imputed to us. It was <hi>actively</hi>
his, but <hi>passively</hi> ours. He wrought it,
though we wear it. It was wrought in
the person of God-man for the whole
Church, and is imputed (not transfused)
to every single Believer for his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
only. For,</p>
                     <p>(1.) It is most absurd to imagine that
the Righteousness of Christ should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
inhere in the person of all, or any
Believer, as it doth in the person of the
Mediator. The impossibility hereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
plainly from the incapacity of the
Subject. The Righteousness of Christ
is an Infinite Righteousness, because it is
the Righteousness of God-man, and can
therefore be subjected in no other person
beside him. It is capable of being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to a finite creature, and therefore
in the way of imputation we are said
<hi>to be made the righteousness of God in him:</hi>
but though it may be imputed to a finite
creature, it inheres only in the person of
the Son of God, as in its proper subject.
And indeed,</p>
                     <p>(2.) If it should be inherent in us,
it could not be imputed to us as it is,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 6, 23. Nor need we go out of
our selves for justification, as now we
must, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. but may justify our
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:54465:218"/>
selves by our own inherent Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
And</p>
                     <p>(3 <hi>dly,</hi>) What should hinder, if this
Infinite Righteousness of Christ were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
into us, and should make us as
compleatly righteous as Christ; but that
we might justify others also, as Christ
doth: and so we might be the Saviours
of the Elect, as Christ is? Which is most
absurd to imagine. And</p>
                     <p>(4 <hi>thly,</hi>) According to <hi>Antinomian</hi>
Principles, What need was there that we
should be justified at all? Or, what place
is left for the justification of any sinner
in the World? For according to their
Opinion, the justification of the Elect is
an immanent act of God before the
World was; and that Eternal act of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
making the Elect as compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Righteous as Christ himself, there
could not possibly be any the least guilt
in the Elect to be pardoned; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
no place, or room could be left
for any Justification in time. And then
it must follow, that seeing Christ died
in time for sin, according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
It must be for his own sins that he
died, and not for the sins of the Elect;
Diametrically opposite to <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 25. and
the whole current of Scripture, and faith
of Christians.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="388" facs="tcp:54465:219"/>
'Tis therefore very unbecoming and
unworthy of a justified person, after
Christ hath taken all his guilt upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and suffer'd all the punishment due
thereunto in his place and room: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of an humble and thankful admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his unparallel'd grace therein,
to throw more than the guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of his sins upon Christ, even
the transgression it self: and comparing
his own Righteousness with Christ's, to
say he is as compleatly Righteous as
Christ himself. This is as if a company
of Bankrupt Debtors Arrested for their
own Debts, ready to be cast into Prison,
and not having one Farthing to satisfy,
after their Debts have been freely and
fully discharg'd by another, out of his
immense treasure; should now compare
with him, yea, and think they honour'd
him, by telling him, that now they are as
compleatly Rich as himself.</p>
                     <p>I am well assur'd no good Man would
embrace an Opinion so derogatory to
Christ's Honour as this is; did he but
see the odious consequences of it, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he would abhor them as much as we.
And as for those now in Heaven, who
fell into such mistakes in the way thither,
were they now acquainted with what is
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:54465:219"/>
transacted here below, they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
rejoyce in the detection of those
mistakes, and Bless God for the refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them.</p>

                     <p>They seem to be induced into this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
by misunderstanding the Apostle, in
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. as if the scope of that Text
were to assert the benefits of sin to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
persons; whereas he speaks there of
Adversities and Afflictions befalling the
Saints in this Life. <hi>Vniversalis restrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:54465:220"/>
est ad materiam subjectam, loquitur
enim de afflictionibus piorum.</hi> The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
matter (saith <hi>Pareus</hi> on the place)
restrains the Universal expression of the
Apostle: For when he there saith, <hi>All
things shall work together for good;</hi> he
principally intends the afflictions of the
Godly, of which he treats there in that
context. It may be extended also to all
providential events; <hi>Omnia quaecunque eis
accedunt forinsecus, tam adversa, quàm
prospera:</hi> All adverse and prosperous
events of things without us, as <hi>Estius</hi>
upon the place notes. Nothing is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of sin in this Text. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
distributing this General into Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
<hi>verse</hi> 38. plainly shews, what are
the things he intended by his Universal
expression, <hi>verse</hi> 28. as also in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
no creature can do the Saints any
hurt, namely, that they shall never <hi>be
able to separate them from the love of God,
which is in Christ Iesus our Lord.</hi> And in
this respect it is true that the Sins of the
Elect shall not hurt them, by frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the purpose of God concerning their
Eternal Salvation; or totally and finally
to separate them from his Love. This
we grant, and yet we think it a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary,
and unsound expression, <hi>That Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:54465:220"/>
need not fear their own sins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they can do them no hurt:</hi> 'Tis too
general and unguarded a Proposition to
be received for truth. What if their sins
cannot do them that hurt, to frustrate
the purpose of God, and Damn them to
Eternity in the World to come? Can it
therefore do them no hurt at all in their
present state of conflict with it in this
World? For my part, I think the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
fear of caution is due to sin, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
evil; and that <hi>Chrysostome</hi> spake more
like a Christian, when he said, <hi>Nil nisi
peccatum timeo,</hi> I fear nothing but sin.
Though sin cannot finally ruine the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
yet it can many ways hurt and
injure the Believer; and therefore ought
not to be misrepresented as such an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and harmless thing to them. In
vain are so many terrible threatnings in
the Scriptures against it, if it can do us
no hurt; and it is certain nothing can
do us good, but that which makes us
better, and more Holy: But Sin can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pretend to that, of all things in the
World. But to come to an issue, Sin
may be consider'd three ways.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Formally.</item>
                        <item>2. Effectively.</item>
                        <item>3. Reductively.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="392" facs="tcp:54465:221"/>
                        <hi>First, Formally,</hi> as a transgression of
the Preceptive part of the Law of God,
and under that consideration it is the
most formidable evil in the whole World.
The evil of evils, at which every gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
heart trembles, and ought rather
to chuse Banishment, Prison, and Death
it self in the most terrible form, than
Sin, or that which is most tempting in
Sin, the pleasures of it; as <hi>Moses</hi> did,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Sin may be consider'd <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively,</hi>
with respect to the manifold
mischiefs and calamities it produceth in
the World, and the Spiritual and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Evils it infers upon Believers
themselves: Though it cannot Damn
their Souls, yet it makes War against
their Souls, and brings them into mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Bondage and Captivity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23.
It wounds their Souls, under which
wounds they are feeble and sore broken;
yea, they roar by reason of the disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their hearts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 38. 5, 8. Is War,
Captivity, Festering painful Wounds,
causing them to roar, no hurt to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers?
It breaks their very Bones, <hi>Ps.</hi> 51. 8.
And is that no hurt? It draws off their
Minds from God, interrupts their Prayers
and Meditations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18, 19, 20, 21.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:54465:221"/>
And is there no hurt in that? It causeth
their Graces to decline, wither, and
languish to that degree, that the things
which are in them are ready to die,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 1. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4. And is the
loss of Grace and Spiritual strength, no
hurt to a Believer? It hides the Face of
God from them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 2. And is there
no hurt in spiritual withdrawments of
God from their Souls? Why then do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
Saints so bitterly lament and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan
it? It provokes innumerable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
and miseries, which fall upon
our Bodies, Relations, Estates; and if
Sin be the cause of all these inward and
outward miseries to the People of God,
sure then there is some hurt in Sin, for
which the Saints ought to be afraid
of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Sin may be consider'd <hi>Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,</hi>
as it is over-ruled, reduced, and
finally issued by the Covenant of Grace.
Under this consideration of sin, which
rather respects the future, than present
state, the <hi>Antinomians</hi> only respect the
hurt, or evil of it; over-looking both the
former considerations of sin, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the present state of Believers, and
so rashly pronounce, sin can do Believers
no hurt. An Assertion tending to a great
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:54465:222"/>
deal of looseness and licentiousness. A
Man drinks deadly Poison, and is after
many months recover'd by the skill of an
excellent Physician; shall we say, there
was no hurt in it, because the man died
not of it: sure those fearful twinges he
felt, his loss of strength and stomach,
were hurtful to him, tho he escaped with
life, and got this advantage by it, to be
more wary for ever after. <hi>Tantum Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio
potuit suadere malorum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And then for other mens sins, (which
they say we need not fear) 'tis an Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
against all the Laws of Charity.
For the sins of wicked men eternally
damn them: Disturb the Peace and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the World: Draw down Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Judgments upon the whole Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
Cause Wars, Plagues, Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Considerations of
the sins of others, opened fountains of
tears in <hi>David</hi>'s Eyes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119, 136.
caused horror to take hold upon him,
<hi>vers.</hi> 53. And yet if you will believe
the <hi>Antinomian</hi> Doctrine, Believers have
no need to fear, much less be in horror
(which is the extremity of fear) for other
mens sins. How is Satan gratified, and
temptations to sin strengthned upon the
Souls of men, by such indistinct, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:54465:222"/>
and dangerous Expressions as
these are? A good Intention can be no
sufficient salvo for such Assertions as
these.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> 
                        <q>They tell us, That as the
Saints need fear no sin for any <hi>hurt</hi> it
can do them, so they must do no duty
for their own <hi>good;</hi> or with an eye to
their own Salvation, or Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
in Heaven.</q>

                     <p>This, as the former, is too generally
and indistinctly deliver'd. He that distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
well, teacheth well. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
of things which ought to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd,
easily runs men into the bogs
of Errors. Two things ought to have been
distinguish'd here:
<list>
                           <head>in Duties.</head>
                           <item>1. Ends</item>
                           <item>2. Self-ends</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, <hi>Ends in Duty;</hi> There are two
ends in Duties: one <hi>supream</hi> and <hi>ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi>
viz. the glorifying of God, which
must, and ought to take the first place
of all other ends. Another <hi>secondary</hi> and
<hi>subordinate,</hi> viz. the good and benefit of
our selves. To invert these, and place
our own good in the room of God's
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:54465:223"/>
Glory, is sinful and unjustifiable; and
he that aims only at himself in Religion,
is justly censured as a mercenary Servant,
especially if it be any external good he
aims at; but spiritual good, especially
the enjoyment of God, is so involv'd in
the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the glory of God, that
no man can rightly take the Lord for his
God, but he must take him for his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Good, and consequently therein
may, and must have a due respect to
his own happiness.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Self-ends</hi> must also be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
into
<list>
                           <item>1. Corrupt, or carnal Self-ends.</item>
                           <item>2. Pure and spiritual Self-ends.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to carnal and corrupt Self-ends, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting
and moving men to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of Religious Duties: when these
are the only Ends men aim at, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray
the Hypocrisy of the Heart: and
accordingly God charges Hypocrisy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such Persons, <hi>Hosea 7. 14. They have
not cried unto me with their heart, when
they howled upon their Beds: they assemble
themselves for Corn and Wine,</hi> &amp;c. God
reckons not the most solemn Duties ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
by such Ends, to be done unto
him, <hi>Zech. 7. 5. Did ye at all fast to
me?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="397" facs="tcp:54465:223"/>
But beside these, Man hath a <hi>best
self,</hi> a <hi>spiritual self,</hi> to regard in duty,
<hi>viz.</hi> The conformity of his Soul to God
in holiness, and the perfect fruition of
God in glory. Such holy Self-ends as
these, are often commended, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
condemned in Scripture. 'Twas
the Encomium of <hi>Moses,</hi> That <hi>he had
respect unto the recompence of reward,</hi> Heb.
11. 26. These ordinate respects to our
spiritual best self, are so far from being
our sin, that God both appoints and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
them for great uses and advantages
to his People in their way to glory. They
are (1.) Singular Encouragements to the
Saints under Persecution, Streights and
Distresses, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. And to that
end Christ proposes them, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 32.
And so the best of Saints have made use
of them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17, 18. (2.) They
are Motives and Incentives to Praise and
Thankfulness, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 3, 4. 1 Coloss.</hi> 12.
(3.) They stir up the Saints to chearful
and vigorous industry for God, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.
23, 24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 58.</p>
                     <p>Now to cut off from Religion all
these spiritual and excellent Self-respects,
and to make them our sins, and marks of
our Hypocrisy, is an Error very injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the Gospel, and to the Souls of
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:54465:224"/>
Men. For (1.) it crosses the strain of
the Gospel, which commands us to strive
for our Salvation, <hi>Luk. 13. 24, 25. Phil.
2. 12. 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 16. (2.) It blames that
in the Saints as sinful, which the Scripture
notes as their excellency, and records to
their praise, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 26. (3.) It makes
the Laws of Christianity to thwart and
cross the very fundamental Law of our
Creation, which inclines and obliges
all men to intend their own Felicity.
And on this account, not only our
<hi>Antinomians</hi> are blame-worthy, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
also, who are far enough from their
Opinion, who urge humiliation for sin
beyond the Staple: teaching men, they
are not humbled enough till they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to be damned. (4.) It unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
supposes a Christian may not do that
for his own Soul, which he daily doth,
and is bound to do for other mens Souls,
<hi>viz.</hi> to pray, preach, exhort and reprove
for their Salvation.</p>

                     <p>(1.) The confounding of distinct Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,
leads them into this Error; we
acknowledge there was a Covenant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
made with Christ alone, which we
call the <hi>Covenant of Redemption.</hi> This
Covenant indeed, though it were made
<hi>for</hi> us, yet it was not made <hi>with</hi> us. It
had its Condition, and that Condition
was laid only upon Christ: <hi>viz.</hi> That he
should assume our Nature, and pour out
his Soul unto death, which Condition
he was solely concerned to perform; but
beside this, there is a <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi>
made with him, and with all Believers
in him: with him <hi>primarily</hi> as the Head,
with them as the Members, who perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
come into this Covenant, when
they come into union with him by Faith.
This Covenant of Grace is not made with
Christ alone, personally considered, but
with Christ, and all that are his, mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
considered, and is properly made
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:54465:225"/>
with all Believers in Christ; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is called their Covenant, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.
11. <hi>As for thee also, by the blood of thy Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
I have sent forth thy Prisoners out
of the Pit wherein is no water.</hi> So when
God entred into the Covenant of Grace
with <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17. 7. <hi>I will establish
my Covenant</hi> (saith he) <hi>between me and
thee, thy Seed after thee.</hi> So when
he took the People of <hi>Israel</hi> into this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<hi>Ezek. 16. 8. I sware unto thee</hi>
(saith he) <hi>and entred into a Covenant
with thee, and thou becamest mine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Covenant of Grace made with
Believers in Christ, is not the same, nor
must it be confounded with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of <hi>Redemption</hi> made with Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the World began. They are two
distinct Covenants; for in the Covenant
of Grace, into which Believers are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
there is a <hi>Mediator,</hi> and this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
is Christ himself; but in the other
<hi>Covenant of Redemption</hi> there neither
was, nor could be any <hi>Mediator,</hi> which
manifestly distinguishes them. Besides,
In the Covenant of Grace Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queaths
manifold and rich Legacies, as
he is the Testator; but no man gives a
Legacy to himself. This Covenant is
really and properly made with every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:54465:225"/>
as he is a Member of Jesus Christ
the Head; and they are truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

them therein by promises of strength
to be deriv'd from Christ to enable them
thereunto.</p>
                     <p>(2.) We thankfully acknowledge,
That the glory of the New Covenant is
chiefly discovered in the Promises there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
upon the best Promises it is establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And all the Promises are reducible to
the Covenant. They meet, and center
in it as the Rivers in the Sea, or Beams in
the Sun. But yet we cannot say, that
nothing but Promises is contain'd in this
Covenant: for there are Duties requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by it, as well as Mercies promised
in it.</p>
                     <p>Nor may we say, That those Duties
required by it, are required only to be
performed by Christ, and not by us; but
they are required to be performed by us
in his strength. Nor is it Christ that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
and believes for us, but we our
selves are to believe and repent in the
strength of his Grace. And till we do so
actually in our own persons, we have no
part or portion in the Blessings and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of this Covenant. If Christ by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:54465:226"/>
for us, give us an actual Right
and Title to the Promises and Blessings of
the New Covenant, then it will una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
follow,</p>
                     <p>(1.) That men, who never repented
for one sin in all their lives, may be, nay,
certainly are pardoned as much as the
greatest Penitents in the World; because
though they never repented themselves,
yet Christ repented for them: expresly
contrary to his own words, <hi>Luke 13. 3.
Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</hi>
And contrary to his own established Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<hi>Luke 29. 47. Acts</hi> 3. 19.</p>
                     <p>(2.) It will also follow, That Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
who never had union with Christ
by one vital act of Faith in all their lives,
may be, nay certainly shall be saved, as
well as those that are actual Believers:
because though they be Unbelievers in
themselves, yet Christ believed for them:
expresly contrary to <hi>Mark 16. 16. He
that believeth not, shall be damned.</hi> John
3. 36. <hi>He that believeth not the Son, shall
not see life; but the wrath of God abideth
on him.</hi> And <hi>Luke 12. 46. He will cut
him in sunder, and will appoint him his
portion with unbelievers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(3.) It will also follow from hence,
That men may continue in a state of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:54465:226"/>
all their days, and yet may be
sav'd as well as the most obedient Souls
in the World: expresly contrary to <hi>Eph.
5. 6. Let no man deceive you with vain
words; for because of these things, cometh
the wrath of God upon the Children of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience.</hi>
And <hi>Rom. 2. 8. But unto them
that are contentio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

truth, but obey unrighteousness, indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and wrath.</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 17. What
shall the end of them be that obey not the
Gospel of God!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Language sounds strange and
harsh to the Ears of Christians; a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
Christ saving the impenitent
Sinner: A believing Christ saving
Unbelievers: An obeying Christ sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obstinate and disobedient Wretches.
Whither doth such Doctrine tend, but
to encourage and fix men in their impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence,
unbelief, and disobedience? But
the Lord grant no poor Sinner in the
World may trust to this, or build his
hopes of Eternal Life upon such a loose,
sandy foundation as this is. Reader, All
that Christ hath done without thee, will
not, cannot be effectual to thy Salvation,
unless Repentance, Faith and Obedience
be wrought by the Spirit in thy Soul. 'Tis
<hi>Christ in thee that is the hope of glory,

                     <p>I am not at all surprized at this strange
and absonous Language. 'Tis a false and
dangerous Conclusion, yet such as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
results from, and by a kind of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
follows out of their other Errors.
For if the Elect be all justified from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and that neither Repentance, Faith
or Obedience be required of us in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace; but were all required
of, and performed by Christ, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,
believed, and obeyed for us;
then indeed I cannot understand what
relation our Sanctification hath to our
Justification; or how it should be an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
mark or sign thereof: or what
regard is due from Christians to any
Grace or Work of the Spirit wrought
in them, to clear up their Interest in
Christ to them. For we being in Christ,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:54465:227"/>
and in state of Justification, before we
were naturally born, we must necessarily
be so before we be regenerated, or new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born;
and consequently, no work of
Grace wrought in us, or holy Duties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by us, can be evidential of that
which from Eternity was done before
them, and without them.</p>
                     <p>(1.) I grant indeed, That many vain
Professors do cheat and deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by false unscriptural signs and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
as well as by true ones misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
                     <p>(2.) I grant also, That by reason of
the deceitfulness of the Heart, instabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Thoughts, similar works of
common Grace in Hypocrites, Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the World, Wiles of Satan,
weakness of Grace, and prevalency of
Corruptions: the clearing up of our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
by our Sanctification, is a work
that meets with great and manifold Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
which are the things that most
Christians complain of.</p>
                     <p>(3.) I also grant, That the evidence
of our Sanctification in this, or any other
method, is not essential, and absolutely
necessary to the being of a Christian. A
man may live in Christ, and yet not
know his interest in him, or relation to
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:54465:228"/>
him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 10. Some Christians, like
Children in the Cradle, live, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not that they live: are born to a
great Inheritance, but have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of it, or present comfort in it.</p>
                     <p>(4.) I will further grant, That the
Eye of a Christian may be too intently
fixed upon his own gracious qualification;
and being wholly taken up in the reflex
Acts of Faith, may too much neglect the
direct Acts of Faith upon Christ, to the
great detriment of his Soul.</p>
                     <p>But all this notwithstanding, The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of our Justification by our San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
is not only a lawful, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
but a very excellent and necessary
work and duty. 'Tis the course that
Christians have taken in all Ages. And
that which God hath abundantly blessed
to the joy and encouragement of their
Souls.</p>
                     <p>He hath furnished our Souls to this
end with noble self-reflecting Powers
and Abilities. He hath answerably fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
his Word with variety of marks
and signs for the same end and use. Some
of these marks are <hi>exclusive</hi> to detect
and bar bold presumptuous Pretenders,
1 <hi>Cor. 6. 9. Rev.</hi> 21. 8, 27. Some are
<hi>inclusive marks,</hi> to measure the strength
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:54465:228"/>
and growth of Grace by, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20.
And others are <hi>positive signs,</hi> flowing
out of the very essence of Grace, or the
New-Creature, 1 <hi>Iohn 4. 13. Hereby we
know that we dwell in him, and he in us,
because he hath given us of his Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He hath also expresly commanded us
to examine and prove our selves: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided
the neglectors of that duty, and
enforced their duty upon them by a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
Argument, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5. Examine
your selves whether ye be in the faith, prove
your own selves; know ye not your own
selves, how that Iesus Christ is in you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ye be Reprobates.</hi> In a word, For this
end and purpose, amongst others, were
the Scriptures written, 1 <hi>Iohn 5. 13. These
things have I written to you, that believe on
the name of the Son of God, that ye may
know that ye have eternal life.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to neglect this duty, is exceeding
dangerous; but to deny, and deride it,
intolerable. It may justly be feared, such
men will be drown'd in perdition, who
fall into the waters, by making a bridge
over them with their own shadows.</p>
                     <p>For my own part, I verily believe that
the sweetest hours Christians enjoy in
this World, is, when they retire into their
Closets, and sit there concealed from all
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:54465:229"/>
eyes, but him that made them; looking
now into the <hi>Bible,</hi> then into their own
<hi>Hearts,</hi> and then up to God: closely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the grand Debate about their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in Christ, till they have brought
it to the happy desired issue.</p>
                     <p>And now, Reader, for a close of all,
I call the Searcher of Hearts to witness,
That I have not intermedled with these
Controversies of <hi>Antipaedobaptism,</hi> and
<hi>Antinomianism,</hi> our of any delight I take
in Polemical Studies, or an unpeaceable
contradicting Humour, but out of pure
zeal for the Glory and Truths of God, for
the vindication and defence whereof, I
have been necessarily ingaged therein.
And having discharged my duty thus far,
I now resolve to return (if God will permit
me) to my much sweeter and more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Studies; Still maintaining my Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Charity for those whom I oppose; not
doubting but I shall meet those in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
from whom I am forced in lesser
things to dissent and differ upon Earth.</p>

IN A
SERMON
Preached by I. F.
Author of the Foregoing DISCOURSE.
FROM
<bibl>I COR. I. 10.</bibl>
               <q>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name
of our Lord Iesus Christ, That ye all
speak the same thing; and that there be
no divisions among you; but that ye be
perfectly joined together in the same
mind, and in the same judgment.</q>
            </head>
            <p>WHEN I consider this
Healing and Uniting
Text, and the scandalous
Divisions of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
to which I recommend it, I
could chuse rather to comment thereon
with Tears, than Words. 'Tis just mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of lamentation, to think what feeble
influences such Divine and Pathetical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations
have upon the minds and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:54465:230"/>
hearts of professed Christians. But it is
not Lamentations, but proper Counsels,
and convictions obey'd, must do the work.</p>
            <p>The Primitive and Purest Churches of
Christ, consisted of imperfect Members,
who notwithstanding they were knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by the same internal bond of the
Spirit, and the same external bonds of
common Profession, and common Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and enjoyed extraordinary helps for
uniting, in the Presence and Doctrine of
the Apostles among them; yet quickly
discovered a Schismatical Spirit, dividing
both in Judgment and Affection, to the
great Injury of Religion, and Grief of
the Apostle's Spirits. To check and heal
this growing-Evil in the Church at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi>
the Apostle addresses his Patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Exhortation to them, and to all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Churches of Christ, whom it equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerns, in the words of my Text.
<hi>Now I beseech you, brethren,</hi> &amp;c. Where note
<list>
                  <item>1. The Duty exhorted to.</item>
                  <item>2. The Arguments enforcing the Duty.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. The Duty exhorted to; namely,
Unity; the Beauty, Strength, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
as well as the Duty of a Church.
This Unity he describes two ways, 1. As
it is Exclusive of its opposite, Schism or
Division. All Rents, and rash Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:54465:230"/>
are contrary to it, and destructive
of it: <hi>I beseech you, brethren, that there
be no Divisions</hi> [or Schisms] <hi>among you.</hi>
2. As it is inclusive of all that belongs to
it; namely, the Harmony and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Judgments, Hearts, and
Language. (1.) That ye all speak the
same thing. (2.) That ye be perfectly
joined together in one Mind. And (3.) In
the same Judgment. This threefold U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in Judgment, Affection, and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
includes all that belongs to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Concord, makes the Saints <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
men of one Heart and Soul, the loveliest
sight this World affords, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 46, 47.</p>
            <p>(2.) The Arguments enforcing this
Duty upon them, comes next under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.
And these are Three. (1.) <hi>I
beseech you.</hi> (2.) I beesech you, <hi>Brethren.</hi>
(3.) I beseech you, brethren, <hi>by the name
of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> These Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are not of equal Force and Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:
The first is great: The second great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
The last the most efficacious, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible,
of all the rest: But all together
should come with such Power, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible
Efficacy upon the Judgments,
Consciences, and Hearts of Christians, as
should perfectly knit them together, and
defeat all the Designs of Satan, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:54465:231"/>
without them, or of their own Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
within them, to rend asunder
their Affections or Communion.</p>
            <p>And first,<note place="margin">Arg. 1.</note> he enforces the Duty of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
by a solemn Apostolical Obsecration
and Adjuration; <hi>I beseech</hi> you, saith he;
he had Power to command them to this
Duty, and threaten them for the neglect
of it: He had in readiness to revenge all
Disobedience, and might have shaken
that Rod over them; but he chuseth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to intreat and beseech them: Now I
<hi>beseech</hi> you, Brethren: Here you have,
as it were, the great <hi>Apostle</hi> upon his
knees before them, Meekly and Patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
entreating them to be at perfect U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
among themselves. 'Tis the intreaty
of their Spiritual Father, that had begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
them to Christ. Now [I] beseech
you, brethren, <hi>I</hi> who was the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Christ's hand, of your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to him: <hi>I,</hi> that have planted you a
Gospel-Church, and assiduously watered
you: I beseech you by all the spiritual
tyes and endearments betwixt me and
you, that there be no Divisions among
you. This is the first Argument, wrapt
up in a solemn Obsecration.</p>
            <p>Next, he enforces the Duty of Unity,
by the nearness of their Relation; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:54465:231"/>
you, <hi>Brethren:</hi> Brotherhood is an
endearing thing, and naturally draws
Affection and Unity with it, 1 Pet. 3. 8.
<hi>Be ye all of one mind; having compassion
one of another; love as brethren; be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
be courteous; ye are the children of
one Father, joint-heirs of one and the same
inheritance.</hi> To see an <hi>Egyptian</hi> smiting
an <hi>Israelite,</hi> is no strange sight; but to
see one <hi>Israelite</hi> quarrelling another, is
most unnatural and uncomely: The
nearer the Relation, the stronger the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
<hi>How good and how pleasant is
it,</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>for Brethren to
dwell together in Vnity! Psal.</hi> 133. 1.</p>
            <p>But the greatest Argument of all is the
last, <hi>viz. In the name of our Lord Iesus
Christ.</hi> In this name he beseeches and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats
them to be at perfect Unity among
themselves. In the former he sweetly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated
the duty by a loving <hi>compellation,</hi>
but here he sets it home by a solemn <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration;</hi>
I beseech you, brethren, <hi>by the
name of our Lord Iesus Christ:</hi> That is to
say, (1.) For Christ's Sake, or for the Love
of Christ; by all that Christ hath done,
suffered, or purchased for you; and as
Christ is dear and precious to you, let
there be no Divisions. If you have any
Love for Christ, don't grieve him, and
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:54465:232"/>
obstruct his great design in the world, by
your Scandalous Schisms. Mr. <hi>Iohn Fox</hi>
never denied a Beggar that asked an
Alms of him, for Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>esus Sake.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>In the name of our Lord Iesus Christ;</hi>
that is, in the Authority of Christ; for
so his Name also signifies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. and
it is as if he had said, If you reverence
the Supreme Authority and Soveraignty
of Christ, which is the Fountain out of
which so many solemn Commands of
Unity do flow; then see, as you will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
it to him at the Great Day, that ye
be perfectly joined together in one Mind,
and in one Judgment. The Point will
be this:</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>DOCT.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Vnity amongst Believers, especially in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church-Relation, is as desirable
a Mercy, as it is a necessary and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensable
Duty.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>How desirable a Mercy it is, and how
necessary a Duty, let the same Apostle,
who presseth it upon the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in
my Text, be heard again, enforcing the
same Duty with the same warmth, upon
the Church at <hi>Philippi,</hi> chap. 2. v. 1, 2.
<hi>If there be therefore any consolation in
Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:54465:232"/>
of the spirit, if any bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like-minded,
having the same love, being of one accord, of
one mind.</hi> In handling this Point, I will
shew,
<list>
                     <item>1. What Unity among Believers is.</item>
                     <item>2. How the necessity and desirableness
of it, may be evinced.</item>
                     <item>3. And then lay down the Motives
and Directions about it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>(1.) What Unity amongst Believers
is, and more particularly such Believers
as stand in particular Church-Relation
to each other.</p>
               <p>There is a twofold Union, one <hi>Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>
betwixt Christ and Believers; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Moral,</hi> betwixt Believers themselves:
Faith knits them all to Christ, and then
Love knits them one to another. Their
common relation to Christ their Head,
endears them to each other as Fellow-Members
in the same Body. Hence they
become <hi>Sanguine Christi conglutinati;</hi>
Glued together by the Blood of Christ.
Union with Christ is fundamental to all
Union among the Saints. Perfect Union
would flow from this their common Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with Christ their Head, were they not
here in an imperfect state, where their
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:54465:233"/>
corruptions disturb and hinder it; and
as soon as they shall attain unto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Sanctification, they shall also attain
unto perfect Unity. How their Unity
with one another comes by way of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
resultancy from their Union with
Christ; and how this Unity among
themselves shall at last arise to its just
perfection, that one Text plainly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<hi>Iohn 17. 23. I in them, and thou in
me; that they may be made perfect in
one,</hi>&amp;c.</p>
               <p>Unity amongst those that hold not the
Head, is rather a Conspiracy, than a
Gospel-unity. Believers and unbelievers
may have a Political or Civil union; but
there's no Spiritual unity, but what flows
from joint-membership in Christ. I will
not deny, but in particular Churches
there may be, and still are some Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
who hold Communion with the
Saints, and pretend to belong unto Christ,
the same Head with them; but as they
have no real Union with Christ, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have they any sincere affection to the
Saints; and these for the most part, are
they that raise tumults and divisions in
the Church, as disloyal Subjects do in the
Commonwealth. Of these the <hi>Apostle</hi>
speaks, 1 <hi>Ioh. 2. 19. They went out from
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:54465:233"/>
us, but they were not of us; for if they
had been of us, they would no doubt have
continued with us; but they went out, that
it might be made manifest that they were
not all of us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sincere Christianity holds fast the Soul
by a firm bond of Life to the truly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Community, wherein they reap
those spiritual pleasures and advantages
which assure their continuance therein
to a great degree: But those that joyn
with the Church upon carnal and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
inducements, make little conscience
of rending from it; and God permits
their Schismatical Spirits thus to act, for

And so much briefly for the nature
of Unity. Next,</p>
               <p>(2.) Let us evince both the necessity
and desirableness of this Unity among
Believers; and this will appear in a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
respect: <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. With respect to the Glory of
God.</item>
                  <item>2. The Comfort and Benefit of
our own Souls.</item>
                  <item>3. The Conversion and Salvation
of the World.</item>
               </list>
               <p>(1.) With respect to the Glory of
God. The manifestative Glory of God
(which is all the Glory we are capable of
giving him, is the very end of our Being,
and should be dearer to us than our
Lives) is exceedingly advanced by the
Unity of his people. Hence is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle's
Prayer, <hi>Rom. 15. 5, 6. Now the
God of patience and consolation, grant you
to be like minded one towards another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Christ Iesus, that you may with
one mind and one mouth glorify God.</hi> 'Tis
highly remarkable, That the Apostle in
this Petition for the Unity of the Saints,
doth not only describe that Unity he
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:54465:235"/>
prays for, one Mouth and one Mind,
and shews how much God would be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
by such an Union; but he also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
himself to God for it, under these
two remarkable Titles, the <hi>God of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
and consolation;</hi> thereby intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
two things; (1.) How great need
and exercise there is of patience, in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
Unity among the Saints: They
must bear one another's burthens; they
must give allowance for mutual infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
For the Church here is not an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of Spirits of just Men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
The Unity of the Saints therefore
greatly depends upon the exercise of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi>
one towards another; and this he
begs <hi>the God of Patience</hi> to give them.
And to endear this Grace of Patience to
them, He (2.) joyns with it another
Title of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>God of Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
wherein he points them to that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
comfort which would result un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
themselves from such a blessed Unity
continued and maintained by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
exercises of patience and forbearance
one towards another. And to set home
all, he lays before them the pattern and
example of Christ; <hi>The God of patience
and consolation grant you to be like minded
according to Christ.</hi> How many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:54465:235"/>
infirmities and failures in Duty,
doth Christ find in all his people? Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
which, he maintaineth Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Communion with them; and if
they, after his example, shall do so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
with one another, God will be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
glorified therein. This will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
both the Truth and Excellency of
the Christian Religion, which so firmly
knits the hearts of its Professors toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>(2.) <hi>Secondly,</hi> The necessity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirableness
of this Unity farther appears,
by the deep interest that the comfort
and benefit of our Souls have in it. A
great example hereof we have in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.
46, 47. Oh! what cheeriness, strength,
and pleasure, did the Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
reap from the Unity of their Hearts
in the ways and worship of God? Next
unto the pleasure and delight of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Communion with God himself,
and the shedding abroad of his Love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our Hearts by the Holy-Ghost; none
like that which ariseth from the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
exercises of the graces of the Saints
in their mutual Duties and Communions
one with another. How are their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
dilated and refreshed by it? What
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:54465:236"/>
a lively emblem is here of Heaven! the
Courts of Princes afford no such delights.
Whereas on the other side, when Schisms
have rent Churches a-sunder, they go
away from each other exasperated, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and wounded, crying out, Oh, that
I had a Cottage in the Wilderness! or,
oh! that I had the Wings of a Dove,
that I might flee away, and be at rest</p>
               <p>(3.) <hi>Lastly,</hi> The necessity and desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of this Union further appears
with respect unto the World, who are
allured to Christ by it, and scared off
from Religion by the feuds and divisions
of Professors. To this the Prayer of
Christ hath respect, <hi>Ioh. 17. 23. That
they may be made perfect in one, that the
world may know that thou hast sent me.
q. d.</hi> This, O Father, will be a convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
evidence to the World, of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
both of my Person and Doctrine,
and a great ordinance for their conversion
to me, when they shall see my people
cleaving inseparably unto me by Faith,
and to one another by Love. And on
the other side, it will be a fatal stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block
in the way of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to observe my followers biting and
devouring, rending and tearing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

when he saith, <hi>If there be any consolation
in Christ:</hi> And 'tis as if he had said, I
passionately and earnestly intreat you
by all that comfort and joy you have
found in your mutual Communion from
Christ, and his Ordinances, wherein
you have comfortably walked together,
by all that comfort resulting from the
mutual exercises, and fruits of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Love; by the unspeakable joys and
delights the Spirit of God hath shed
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:54465:237"/>
down upon you, whilst you walked in

all the bowels of compassion and mercy
you have for your selves, for your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
or for the poor carnal World,
who are in hazard of being destroyed by
your divisions: Or for me, your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,

                  <p>Reflect upon the late long and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
troubles you have been under, as the
just rebukes of God for your former
contentions and follies.</p>
                  <p>I need not tell you, you are but late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pluck'd as brands out of the burning,
and that the smell of Fire is yet upon
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:54465:238"/>
you. The time lately was, when you
gat your Bread with the peril of your
lives; when God handed it to you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
your Enemies backs; when your
eyes did not, could not behold your
former Teachers, except in Corners or
Prisons, when your Souls were sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for the solemn Assemblies; when you
mournfully confessed before the Lord,
that these were the just and deserved
punishments for your wantonness, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renness,
and provoking animosities. These
things were not only the matter of your
humble confessions; but the reformation
of those evils was what you solemnly
promised the Lord, when he should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
restore you to your liberty. What!
And is the Rod no sooner off your backs,
but you will to the old work again?
Read <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. and view
the face of this Sin in that glass. Have
we been so many years in the furnace,
and our dross not purged? Such sharp
and long-continued afflictions produce
no better effects? It may be said of our
troubles, as of the Siege of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> Ezek.
29. 18. <hi>Every head was made bald, and
every shoulder peeled.</hi> Some of us went
young Men into persecution and trouble,
and are come forth old; and which is
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:54465:238"/>
worst of all, we bring our old corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
forth with us. Either we did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
and bewail these sins in the days of
our affliction, or we did not. If we did
not, we were incorrigible, and defeated
the design of the Rod. If we did, our
Confessions and Sorrow were either sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
or hypocritical: If sincere, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they would effectually caution us, that
we return not again to folly, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.
13, 14. <hi>After all that is come upon us for
our evil deeds, and for our great trespass,
seeing that thou, our God, hast punished us
less than our iniquities deserve; and hast

call them in a few hours to end the strife
amongst us. We act not only beneath
the Rules of Religion, but of Reason
also. Brute creatures will depose their
very Antipathies in a common danger.
Mr. <hi>Tho. Fuller,</hi> in his <hi>History of the

                  <p>How long and how anxiously have we
prayed, and waited for such a day of
Gospel-liberty as we now enjoy? It hath
been one of the sorest afflictions we have
grapled with in the days of our restraint,
that we could not speak unto the carnal
World. If we had opportunity to speak
at all, it was for the most part to such as
stood in need of Edification more than
of Conversion. God hath now, beyond
thoughts of most hearts, opened to us a
door of Liberty to Preach, and for all
that will, to hear. Some fruits we have
already seen, and more we expect. The
Children are as it were coming to the
birth, and will you obstruct it? Will
you give the Gospel a miscarrying-womb?
Be instruments at once, by your
contentions, to destroy the Souls of Men,
and break the very hearts of your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,

whose greatest comfort is bound
up in the success of their Labours? Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
I beseech you read these words as
if they were delivered to you upon my
bended knees; I beseech you for the
Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the
hopes sake of saving the precious immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Souls of Men; and for your poor
Ministers sake, who have scarce any
thing besides the fruits of their Labours,
to recompence their long-continued and
grievous sufferings, depose your animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
maintain the unity of the Spirit in
the Bond of Peace; help us, but don't
hinder us in our hard labours. What
good will our Lives do us, if we must
labour in vain, and spend our strength
for nought? We find it difficult enough
to persuade sinners to come unto Christ,
when no such stumbling-blocks are laid
in the way; the counter-pleas of Satan,
the unbelief and sensualities of unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
nature, are difficulties too great for
us to grapple with; but if to these must
be added prejudices against Religion,
from your dividing Lusts, and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Breaches, what hope then remains?
If you have no pity for your selves, pity
perishing Souls, and pity your poor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
Ministers; have a care you
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:54465:240"/>
make us not to groan to God against you;
or if that be a small thing in your eyes,
have a care lest the Blood of Souls be
charged to your account in the great
day. Are there none in the Towns or
Neighbourhoods where you live? Are
you sure there are none that have hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
inclinations towards Religion? de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
and purposes to attend on the same
means of Grace you sit under, who will
charge the occasion of their Damnation
upon you at the Bar of Christ, and say,
Lord, we had some weak convictions
upon our Consciences, that we needed a
rouzing and searching Minister; we
were convinced that the profane and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
World, among whom we had our
conversation, were not in the right path
that leadeth to Salvation. We felt in
our selves inclinations to cast off our old
Companions, and associate with those
that professed more strictness and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and place our selves under the most
fruitful and advantagious Ministry, and
accordingly improved opportunities to
get acquaintance with them; but when
we came nearer to them, we found such
wrath and envy, such wranglings and
divisions, such undermining and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting
each others reputation; such
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:54465:241"/>
whisperings and tale-bearings, such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
aggravations and improvements of
common failings and infirmities, such
covetousness and worldliness, such pride
and vanity, as gave us such a disgust and
offence at the ways of Reformation, that
we could never more be reconciled to
them. Beware, I say, how you incur the
guilt of such a dreadful charge as this,
by giving liberty to such Lusts and Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
under a profession of Religion, and
pretence to Reformation.</p>

nothing more than Unity among his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

again, for the obtaining of this one thing:
Four times doth he beg for Unity among
them, and every time he seems to rise
higher and higher, beseeching his Father,
(1.) That they may be one. (2.) That
they may be one in us. (3.) That they
may be one as thou and I are one.
and lastly, That they may be made

perfect in one; By all this shewing
how intent his Spirit was upon this
one thing.</p>

you cannot take a readier way to do
it, than by breaking the bonds of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                  <p>Consider how directly your Divisions
cross and frustrate the Design and End
of Church-fellowship which is instituted
for the improvement of each other's
Graces, and helping on the mortification
of each other's Corruptions.</p>
                  <p>God hath distributed variety of gifts
and graces in different degrees amongst
his People; the improvement of these
gifts and graces to the glory of God,
and our mutual edification, is the very
scope and end of particular Church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship

and Communion: every man
hath his proper gift of God, and (as a late

<hi>Iob</hi> was exemplary for plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and patience: <hi>Moses</hi> for faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and meekness: <hi>Iosieh</hi> for tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and a melting Spirit: <hi>Athanasius</hi>
was prudent and active: <hi>Basil</hi> heavenly,
and of a sweet Spirit: <hi>Chrysostom</hi> labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and without affectation: <hi>Ambrose</hi>
resolved and grave. One hath quickness
of parts; but not so solid a Judgment:
Another is solid, but not ready and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential.
One hath a good Wit, another
a better Memory, a third excells them
both in utterance. One is zealous, but
ungrounded; another well principled,
but timorous. One is wary and prudent;
another open and plain-hearted. One is
trembling and melting; another chearful,
and full of comfort. Now the end and use
of Church-fellowship is to make a rich
improvement unto all by a regular use
and exercise of the gifts and graces found
in every one. One must impart his light,
and another his warmth. The Eye (<hi>viz.</hi>
the knowing man) cannot say to the hand
(<hi>viz.</hi> the active man) I have no need of
thee. Unspeakable are the benefits resul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:54465:242"/>
from spiritual and orderly Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
but whatever the benefits be, they
are all cut off by Schisms and Dissentions;
for as Faith is the grace, by which we
receive all from God; so Love is the
grace by which we share and divide the
comfort of all among our selves. The
excellent things of the Spirit are lodg'd
in earthen Vessels, which death will
shortly break, and then we can have no
more benefit by them; but these Jars and
Divisions render Saints, as it were, dead
one to another, whilst they are alive. Ah
how lovely, how sweet and desirable it
is to live in the communion of such Saints
as are described! <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. To hear
them freely, and humbly to open their
hearts and experiences to one another!
After this manner, some say, the art of
Medicine was found out: As any one
met with an Herb, and discovered the
virtue of it by any Accident, he was to
post it up, and so the Physicians skill was
perfected by a collection of those posted
Experiments. But wo to us! we are ready
to post up each other's Failings and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities

When <hi>Ioshua</hi> lay upon his face before

So say I, up, up, fall speedily to your

before you the following plain and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Directions.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>Direction I.</head>
                  <p>The orderly gathering, and filling of
particular Churches, is of great influence
unto the peace and tranquillity of those
Churches: and therefore it greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
all that are interested therein, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
such as are vested with Office-power
to beware whom they receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Communion.</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures do plainly discover to
us, that Church-members ought to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Saints, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 2. 2 Cor. 1. 1, 2.
Acts</hi> 2. 41, to the end. <hi>Ephes. 2. 7. 1 Thes.
1. 2, 3. Rom. 1. 7. Col.</hi> 1. 2. Hence par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Churches are called the Churches
of the Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 33. If admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
belax and negligent, so much hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:54465:244"/>
matter fills the Church, that it
can never be quiet. Christians and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
may live together harmoniously
and coalesce in one orderly and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Society, as having one and the same
Head, one Spirit, the same general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and End; but godly and ungodly,
spiritual and carnal are acted by contrary
Principles, pursue opposite Designs, and
can never heartily coalesce. There is a
spirit of discerning, a judgment of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
in the Saints, and it is especially
desirable in a more eminent degree in
those that have Office-power in the
Church, to judge of mens fit qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for Church-communion. We all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that gross ignorance and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
are just bars to mens admission: and
to deny this, were to take all power from
the Church to preserve the purity of
God's Ordinances, or to cast out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Offenders. None ought to
be admitted into Church-communion,
but such as do appear to the judgment of
Charity (comparing their Professions and
Conversations) to be Christians indeed,
that is, men fearing God, and working
Righteousness.</p>
                  <p>And I make no doubt, but some Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
as well as practices, render men
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:54465:244"/>
unmeet for Church-communion, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.
10. 2 <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. All Opinions which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
Doctrines necessary to be believed,
which the Apostle comprehends under
the name of Faith; and all such Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as are inconsistent with an holy Life,
and overthrow the power of Godliness,
which the Apostle comprehends under
the name of a good Conscience, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.
19, 20. whosoever shall hold or maintain
any such Opinions as these, he is either
to be kept out, if not admitted; or cast
out, if he be in Church-fellowship. In
receiving such, you receive but Spies and
Incendiaries among you. What a Fire-brand
did <hi>Arius</hi> prove, not only in the
Church of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but even to
the whole World? Men of graceless
Hearts, and erroneous Heads, will give
a continual exercise to the patience of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Christians. I deny not but out of the
purest Churches men may arise speaking
perverse things; and yet the Officers and
Members of those Churches be blameless
in their admission: But if they can be
discerned before they be admitted, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
preventive care would be of singular
and seasonable use to the tranquillity of
Church-Societies.</p>

way of Caution:</p>
                  <p>(1.) Let it be for Caution to Ministers
that they mind their proper work,<note place="margin">A Doctore glorioso, à pastore contentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utilibus Questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siam Deus. <hi>Luther</hi>'s Prayer.</note> study
the Peace of the Church, impartially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense
their respects to the Saints com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their charge, not siding with
a Party. There be few Schisms in
Churches, in which Ministers have not
some hand. <hi>Ierome</hi> upon those words,
<hi>Hosea</hi> 9. 8. hath this memorable note;
<hi>Veteres scrutans historias, invenire non
possum scidisse Ecclesiam, praeter eos qui
Sacerdotes a Deo positi fuerunt.</hi> Searching
the Ancient Histories (saith he) I can
find none that hath more rent the Church
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:54465:245"/>
of God, than those that sustain the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Ministers. This is a sad charge,
and 'tis too justly laid upon many of that
Order: Oh what a Blessing is a Prudent,
Patient, Peaceable Minister, to the Flock
over which he watches!</p>
                  <p>(2.) Let the People keep their places,
and study their proper Duties. There
be in most Congregations, some idle
people, who having little to do at home,
are employed upon <hi>Satan</hi>'s Errands to
run from house to house, carrying tales to
exasperate on Christian against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
These the Apostle particularly
marks, and warns the Churches of, 1 <hi>Tim.
5. 13. And withal they learn to be idle,
wandring about from house to house; and not
only idle, but tatlers also, and busie-bodies,
speaking things which they ought not.</hi> If
that one rule of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15,
16. were conscientiously and strictly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to, to tell a trespassing Brother his
sault privately, then with one or two
more, if obstinacy make it necessary, and
not to expose him to the whole Church,
and much less to the whole World, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a plain necessity, How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Ruptures would be prevented in
Christian Societies? But instead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
admonishing and reproving those
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:54465:246"/>
irregular and idle Tatlers (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
calls them) who make it their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to sow jealousies, to make and widen
breaches amongst brethren.</p>
