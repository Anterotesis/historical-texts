            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This sad Devastation the Prophet first beholds <hi>in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo prophetico,</hi> sees it from far in his prophetick <hi>Telescope,</hi> as clearly, and distinctly, as if it were before his eyes, and describes it here and there the whole Sermon through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but chiefly, Cap. xxiv. in so lofty a Language, that many have mistaken it for the <hi>End</hi> of the World, and the Consummation of all things. But then, to sweeten so sad a Theme, he assures them, it shall not be a <gap reason="foreign">

Nor shall they be only preserved, but restored too; <hi>The Lord God will</hi> in time <hi>wipe away every Tear from off all Faces,</hi> and at last, <hi>swallow up</hi> this <hi>Death</hi> too <hi>in Victory,</hi>

            <p>The <hi>first,</hi> to the time of the Ruine it self, Cap. xxiv.

where having set before their Eyes the sad prospect of the holy City, and <hi>House of God</hi> in Flames; <hi>When thus it shall be in the midst of the Land,</hi> saith he, there shall be a Remnant, <hi>and they shall lift up their voyce, and sing for the Majesty of the Lord,</hi> saying, <hi>Glorifie ye the Lord in the Fires,</hi> V. 15. And this is <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>

               </gap> a Song to give Instruction, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and in them us, how to demean our selves, while the Calamity lies upon us: <hi>sc.</hi> to make God our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. to wait for him in the Way of his Judgments, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and in this <hi>9. ver.</hi> earnestly <hi>to desire him from the very soul in the Night</hi> (in the Darkest, and Blackest of the Affliction;) <hi>to seek him early,</hi> when it begins to dawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a better Condition; and in the mean time, as 'tis in the Text, to improve all this severe Discipline, as he intends it, for the advancing us in the knowledge of Him, and of our selves, and of our whole Duty; <hi>For when thy Judgments are in the Earth, the Inhabitants of the World will learn Righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Text you see, that supposeth Judgments in the Earth,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49840:4"/>
or upon a Land (as its Occasions) and so suitable to our sad Condition: a Text too, that proposeth our Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as its End and Design, and so sutable (one would think) to our Inclination too. The Character, and <hi>Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> of the Age, we live in, is <hi>Learned:</hi> the pretence at this day so high, and so universal, that He is No-body now, who hath not a new <hi>Systeme</hi> of the World, a new <hi>Hypothesis</hi> in Nature, a new <hi>Model</hi> of Government, a new <hi>Scheme</hi> of God's Decrees, and the greatest Depths in The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology. We are many of us acute Philosophers (that must not be disputed us;) most of us grand Politicks and Statsemen too; All of us (without exception) deep Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines:—will needs be wiser than our Neighbours, but however wiser than our Teachers and Governours, if not wiser than God himself. A kind of <hi>Moral Rickets,</hi> that swells, and puffs up the Head, while the whole inner Man of the Heart wasts and dwindles. For like the <hi>silly Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 6, 7.</note> Disciples to the old <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> while we are thus <hi>ever learning</hi> (pretending to great Heights, and Proficiencies) we <hi>come never to the Knowledge of the Truth (the Truth which is according unto Godliness;)</hi> In fine, amongst so many Learners they are but few, that learn Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:—And therefore God himself here opens us a School; erects a severe Discipline in the Text; brings forth his <hi>Ferulas,</hi> when nothing else will serve the Turn. For he hath indeed <hi>four</hi> Schools, or rather four distinct Forms, &amp; Classes in the same great <hi>School of Righteousness;</hi> the last only (that of his Judgments) express in the Text, but the Rest too suppos'd at least, or covertly implied.</p>
            <p>For whether we look upon the latter Clause of the proposition. <hi>The Inhabitants of the World will learn;—</hi>We find our selves there under a double Formalitie; As Learners, and as Inhabiters. As Learners first, and so indued <note place="margin">1.</note> with Faculties of Reason; Powers of a Soul capable of Learning, what is to be learned; stampt, and possest with first Principles, &amp; common Notions which deeply search'd,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49840:4"/>
and duly improv'd, and cultivated, might teach us Much of Righteousness. And this is <hi>Schola Cordis in Domo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriori,</hi> the School of the Heart, God's first School in the little World within us. Secondly, as Inhabitants of the <note place="margin">2.</note> great World, which is God's School too, as well as his Temple, full of Doctrines and Instructions; <hi>Schola Orbis,</hi> in which, He takes us forth continual Lessons of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,<hi>—Seque ipsum inculcat, &amp; offert, Ut bene cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosci possit;</hi> and that both from the Natural World, and from the political; whether <hi>Schola Regni,</hi> or <hi>Schola Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae.</hi> Or if we return to the former Branch of the Text, <hi>When thy Judgments are in the Earth.</hi> This <hi>when they</hi> are, supposeth another time, when they <hi>Are Not</hi> in the Earth, and <hi>that time is the time of Love,</hi> (as the Prophet speaks) <note place="margin">Ezek. xvi. 8.</note> the Season of Mercy; So that, Thirdly, here's <hi>Schola Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sericordiarum,</hi> the School of God's tender Mercies inviting <note place="margin">3</note> us, gently leading, and <hi>drawing us with the Cords of a Man,</hi>

               <hi>with the Bands of Love:</hi> And lastly, when nothing else <note place="margin">4.</note> will serve, here's <hi>Schola Judiciorum,</hi> the School of God's severe Judgments driving us to Repentance, and compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us to come in and learn Righteousness. A provision (you see) every way sufficient, and abundant for our Learning,, were not we wanting to our selves.</p>
            <p>But alas! we may run by the Text, and easily read in it these <hi>three</hi> things, as so many very Natural Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and Emanations from it. First, our own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <note place="margin">1.</note> and Stupidity; <hi>Born like a wilde Asse's Colt,</hi> as <hi>Zophar</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jo b. xi. 12.</note> speaks; and then to our Natural we add affected Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance too: So that we are much to seek, and to learn Righteousness it must be taught us. Secondly, God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, <note place="margin">2.</note> and inexpressible Grace and Mercy to us; that when we had blurr'd the Original, defac'd the first Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Righteousness upon our Souls, he was pleas'd to provide Expedients to teach it us again the second time, that we might be <hi>renewed unto Knowledge after the Image</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Col. iii. 10. Ephes. iv. 24.</note> 
               <hi>of him, that created us in Righteousness,</hi> as the Apostle
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49840:5"/>
speaks. And Thirdly, Our indocible and unteachable Humour, our foul and shameful Non-proficiency under <note place="margin">3.</note> so plentiful a Grace. For though the Text indeed speaks of our learning Righteousness, when God's Judgments are upon us; yet (if the Appearances of the World abroad suggested nothing to the contrary) 'tis introduc'd here in the Text too, as the Effect of the last Form in God's School, in exclusion of all the former as ineffectual; his utmost Method not to be used but at a pinch, when all the rest are basfled, and prove improsperous upon us: And then 'tis exprest in the Original, and learned <hi>Versions</hi> with so many Limitations and Abatements (as we shall see by and by) that we may well give it up as the sum and upshot of all, that our All-merciful God omits no Means or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of our Improvement; but we (supinely negligent, and prodigiously stubborn as we are) render them all ineffectual.</p>
            <p>That we may do so no longer, but rather make good the profession, with which we have dar'd to appear this Day before God, of humbling our selves under his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Hand; Let us, before we pass on any further, lift up our Hands and our Hearts to Him in the Heavens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching him by the Power of his Mighty Grace so to sanctifie to us All, both the Sense of his present Judgment, and all our Meditations and Discourses thereupon, that by all we may be promoted in learning Righteousness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THe Inhabitants of the World will learn Righteousness or Justice:</hi> What's that? Is there such a thing in the World? Or is it a Name onely, and a glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence? Is it not only another word for <hi>Interest</hi> or Utility, and so nothing just, but what is profitable; <hi>Carneades</hi> his infamous Assertion retriv'd and own'd with open face <note place="margin">
                  <hi>V. Lactant. lib.</hi> v.</note> by Christians? Is it not the taking of a party, or the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pousing of a Faction, and appearing for it with heat and animosity; and a savage condemning and destroying All that are not of it? Is it not the Profession to believe such a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49840:5"/>
a <hi>System</hi> of Opinions, what life soever is consequent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon? an airy invisible Righteousness, that never embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies or appears in our Actions, but hovers in the Clouds, in speculations and fancies, where no Man can find it?</p>
            <p>The Truth is, there is no piece of Unrighteousness more common in the World, than thus to weigh Justice it self in an unjust Ballance; while every one contrives his <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi> so as to salve the <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> so declares his Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as may best suit and comport with his own unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practices. But the Righteousness we are to learn in God's School, must not be a self-chosen Righteousness: We must not pay God our Soveraign, the Tribute of our Obedience in Coyn of our own stamping; it must be such as will abide the Touchstone of his Word, and the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of his Sanctuary. To make short, Righteousness or Justice, though elsewhere a single Vertue, yet here 'tis vittually All:—<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49840:6"/>
of Righteousness, which this present Judgment of God upon our Land seems most clearly to take us forth, both in relation to God himself, and to our Neighbours; and then call you, and my self to a serious Scrutiny, how well we have learn'd them, and so an end.</p>
            <p>And first we begin (as we ought) in giving God his due; in rendring to God the things that are Gods. To limit this wide Universality too, and render it more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and peculiar, we may reduce all to that first of <hi>Esai</hi>'s three Songs mention'd at the beginning, <hi>Glorifie ye the Lord in the Fires;</hi> giving him upon this sad Occasion the <note place="margin">C. xxiv. 15.</note> Glory of that great Trinity of his Attributes; the Glory of his <hi>Power,</hi> and Majesty; the Glory of his <hi>Justice</hi> and Equity; the Glory of his Goodness and <hi>Mercy.</hi>

How great and glorious our God is, who is in himself incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, appears best by the glorious greatness of his Works. If he builds, it is a World, Heaven and Earth, and the Fulness of both. If he gives, it is his only Son out of his Bosom, the Brightness of his Glory, and the express Image of his Person. If he rewards, 'tis a Crown, 'tis a whole Heaven of Glories. If he be angry, he sends a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge; opens the Cataracts of Heaven above, and breaks up the Fountains of the great Deep below, and pours forth whole Flouds of Vengeance: Or else he rains down Hell out of Heaven, and in a moment turns a Land like <note place="margin">Salvian.</note> the Garden of God into a dead Sea, and a lake of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.

And therefore though it be a nice, and a delicate point to assign the particular sins, for which God hath thus sorely afflicted us; yet must we declare (as we are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by sacred Authority) <hi>That God hath laid his heavy Judgment upon us All, as an Evidence of his Displeasure for</hi>

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49840:8"/>
great Instruments of God's double Vengeance upon the World of the Ungodly: The One long since past record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our Instruction; the Other yet to come, the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (it ought to be, I am sure) of our continual Terror. <hi>The World that then was, perished by Water</hi> (saith S. <hi>Peter) and the World that is now, is reserv'd unto Fire:</hi> In the <note place="margin">2 Pet. iii. 6, 7.</note> mean time, Fire and Water, things of commonest Use with us, are also the standing Metaphors almost in every verse of Scripture, to express God's Judgments of all sorts: Is it not on purpose to remind us, when ever we hear the sound, or make use of the things, or feel the smart of either, to reslect upon the heavy wrath of God against Sin in his so solemn expressions of it? Once more, Fire is the <hi>Tyrant</hi> in Nature, the <hi>King</hi> of the Elements, the mighty <hi>Nimrod</hi> in the Material World. God hath given us this Active Creature for our Servant, and we degrade him to the meanest Offices, to the Drudgery of the Kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and the labour of the Furnace. But God can infran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize him when he pleases, and let him loose upon us; and for our sins, of an useful Servant, make him to us a a rigorous, and a Tyrannical Master. You saw him the other Day, when he escaped from all your Restraints, mockt all your Resistance, scorn'd the Limits, you would have set him: Wing'd with our Guilt, he flew triumphant over our proudest Heights, waving his curl'd Head, seeming to repeat us that Lesson which holy S. <hi>Austin</hi> taught us long since, <hi>That the inferiour Creatures serve us Men, only that we may serve him, who made both us and them too.</hi> If we rebel against Heaven, <gap reason="foreign">

that devour'd his Adversaries? And all to teach us this Lesson, That 'tis Sin puts the Thunder into God's Hand, and turns Flames of Love into a consuming Fire.</p>
            <p>And therefore dream no longer of <hi>Granado's</hi> or <hi>Fire-Balls,</hi> or the rest of those witty Mischiefs; search no more for <hi>Boutefieus</hi> or <hi>Incendiaries, Dutch</hi> or <hi>French:</hi> The Dutch Intemperance, and the French Pride and Vanity, and the rest of their Sins, we are so fond off, are infinitely more dangerous to us, than the Enmity of either Nation; for these make God our Enemy too.

            <p>If yet it be expected I should be more <hi>particular,</hi> in assigning the very Sins that have occasian'd this heavy Judgment, 'tis a slippery place, and hard to keep firm footing in it.

But there is so very much of Mercy even in God's Judgments too, that they also deserve a place amongst his Treasures, ay and amongst ours too. For he licenseth not a Wind, or a Storm, lets not fly a flash of Lightning, or a Ball of Fire, but a Mercy goes along with it; comes flying to us (if we miss it not by our Negligence or Inadvertency) upon the Wings of that Wind; and discovers it self to us even by the Light of those Fires.

            <p>Mercy first, that God spar'd us, and preserv'd us so long.

But though Humane Laws exact only outward Compliances, assume not to themselves to judge the Heart, because they cannot discern it, nor take Cognizance of secret Thoughts and Purposes, further than they are declar'd by overt Acts: Yet God is a Spirit, and a Discerner of the inmost Thoughts and Intentions; and his Law Spiritual too, and given to the Spirit; and the Righteousness taught in his School, is not a Carcase, or an Outside only, but a living Soul, and a Spirit of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness: and by con'equence it stays not in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Act, (the proper Object of Humane Laws and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions;) restrains not only open violences (such as the Judgment-seat of Man condemns, and the Scaffold, or the Gibbet take notice of;) not only smooths and polisheth the outward Garb, to render that plausible in the eyes of the World: But goes yet further and deeper, even to the Heart; composeth the whole Inner-Man too, and labours to approve that to the Righteous Judge, who sees not as Man sees; and in fine, calls us up to that glorious height of the Primitive Christians in <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> who obey'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Municipal Laws of their Countrey, but out-liv'd them too, and surmounted them far, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I have now opened the Book, and laid it before you, and given you a short Draught of this very important Lesson: a Lesson so considerable, that our Wise and Good God thinks it worth the while to rout Armies, and sink Navies; to burn up Cities, and turn Kingdoms upside down; to send Wars, and Plagues, and Conflagrations amongst us; to set open all his Schools, and ply all his severest Methods to teach it us the more effectually. Think now, that he looks down this Day from Heaven to take Notice of our Proficiency; to see how far we are advanc'd by these his Judgments in learning Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness. And is it possible, we should stand out any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? Can we still resist so powerful a Grace? Are not the parts of the Text by this time, happily met together? and the Truth of it accomplisht, and exemplified in us to the full?—Gods Judgments on us, and his Righteousness in us?

Righteousness, as <hi>Cato</hi> did <hi>Greek, Jam Septuagenarius,</hi> just when we are a dying;—Begin then to con our part, when we are ready to be hist off the Stage, and Death is now pulling off our properties.

No no; the great Lesson of the Text is harder and deeper than so: 'Tis that we must sweat for, 'tis that we may bleed for: 'Tis all that <hi>Adam</hi> lost, and All that <hi>Christ</hi> came to recover: 'Tis the Business of our whole life, and 'tis desperate Folly and Madness to defer to learn it till Death, when God now calls us to account for it.

               <hi>Fruit,</hi> saith our Prophet, <hi>to take away sin:</hi> If that remain still in us, Adversity is a bitter Cup indeed. To keep our sins, and hold them fast, even when God's Judgments are upon us for them, this is with <hi>Copronymus,</hi> to pollute the Fountain that should wash us, to defile the salutary Waters of Affliction, to prophane the holy Fires of God's Furnace, and to pass through the Fire to <hi>Moloch,</hi> to some reigning and domineering Sin, some Tyrant-lust, or Mistress-passion. Correction without Instruction, this is the Scourge of Asses, not the Discipline of Men, nor the Rod of the Sons of Men.

            <p>And therefore let us not flatter our selves, nor think that God hath now emptied his Quiver, and spent all his Artillery upon us; Let us not come forth delicately with the foolish <hi>Agag,</hi> saying, <hi>Surely the Bitterness of Death is past:</hi> No, the <note place="margin">1 Sam. xv. 32.</note> Dregs of the Cup of Fury are still behind; God grant we be not forc'd at last to drink them, and suck them up. <hi>Great Plagues remain for the ungodly,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist.

a worse thing befal us. Remember, that when the Touch of God's little Finger did not terrifie us, he soon made us feel the stroak of his heavy hand.

            <p>The Devil of Rebellion and Disobedience, which not long since possest the Nation, rent and tore it till it fom'd again, and pin'd away in lingring Cousumptions; that cast it oft times into the Fire, and oft times into the Water (ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of all sorts) to destroy it; is now through God's Mercies cast out, and we seem to sit quiet, and sober at the Feet of our Deliverer, cloath'd, and in our right Minds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. But yet this <hi>ill</hi> Spirit, this restless Fury (this unquiet and dreadful <hi>Alastor,</hi> the eldest Son of <hi>Nemesis,</hi> and heir ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to all the Teriours and Mischiefs of his Mother) walks about day and night, seeking Rest, and finds none; and he saith in his heart, I will return some time or other to my House from whence I came out. Oh let us take heed of provoking that God, who alone chains up his Fury, least for our Sins he permit him to return once more, with seven other Spirits more wicked than himself, and so our last E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state prove worse than the former.</p>
            <p>The Sword of the Angel of Death, which the last year cut down almost a hundred thousand of us, may seem to have been glutted with our Blood, and to have put up it self into the Scabbard. <hi>Quiesce &amp; sile,</hi> as the Prophet speaks: God grant it may rest here, and be still.

The Sun of Righteousness was ready to rise upon us, with healing in his Wings, to clear our Heaven again, and to scatter the

Cloud of the last years unhealthiness. But yet, methinks, this slow-moving Cloud hangs still o're our Heads, hovers yet in view, with God knows how many Plagues and Deaths in the Bosome of it: and without our serious Amendment we have no Rainbow to assure us, that we shall not again be drencht in that horrible Tempest.

            </p>
            <p>Nay even out of those dead Ashes, can He raise yet a fiercer Flame, to consume what still remains. <hi>As the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning comes out of the East,</hi> saith our Lord, <hi>and shineth even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the West, so shall my coming be, (sc.</hi> to destroy <hi>Jerusalem,) and wherever the Carcase is, will the Eagles be gathered together,</hi> Matth. xxiv. Fire is the Eagle in Nature; nothing in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary World mounts so high to its place, and stoops so low to its prey: the two properties God himself ascribes to that Bird, <hi>Job</hi> xxxix 27, 30. And if we still refuse obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be gathered, like Chickens under our Lord's Wing, he can again let loose this Bird of Prey, this Eagle of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon us; and from the East, where it began before, flie it home like Lightning <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Or if this move us not, let us remember that we have another City upon the Waters, a floating Town of moveable Forts and Castles, the Walls and Bulwarks of the Nation; stronger than those of Brass, the Fable speaks of. As we desire that God would ever <hi>fill their Sails with prosperous Gales,</hi> &amp; still <hi>bring them home with Honor and Victory, and good Success,</hi> Let us take heed that we fight not against them too.

them; nay, our Seditious Murmurings, and Privy Whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perings may blow them'over. For God is <hi>Piorum Rupes, Reorum Scopulus;</hi> a Rock to found the Just upon, but a Shelf to shipwrack, and confound the Unrighteous.</p>
