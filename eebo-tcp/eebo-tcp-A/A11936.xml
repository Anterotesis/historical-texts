         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The care of gathering the ſilke is not alike, the end of that is profit, not only particular delectation.

And what thing is eaſier to do then that, how cold ſoeuer the countrie bee, ſeeing the Silk-wormes are lodged in houſes, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and alſo in a ſeaſon, not altogether cold but in the ſpring time, and part of the ſommer? All the hindrance that can be here alleaged, is, that the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the ſilke will bee more late then in a ſouth countrie: what importeth that, ſo one hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of good and fine ſilke, if one reapes not in the north parts in May and Iune, as they doe in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc</hi> and <hi>Prouence,</hi> if they doe it in Iuly and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt?

But becauſe ſuch trees ſo qualified are very rare, there is no certain account to be made. For the coſt of the affaire, the fourth of the totall is taken: ſo there remaines three parts of liquid reuenew, which makes ſeuen crownes and a halfe, or nine crownes, that twentie, or fiue and twentie Mulberries will bring euery yeere.

Theſe trees are ſo eaſie to take roote, that whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it pleaſe you, you may bring them vp: but with much more aduancement, they will grow in a fatte and moyſt ground, then in a leane and dry. For the quantitie of the leaues, it is to be deſired, to plant the trees in a good ſoile, but not for the quality; becauſe that the leafe neuer comes forth ſo fruitfully out of the fat earth as out of the leane (hauing that of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the Vines) whereof the moſt exquiſite grow in a light molde, ſo that that land there brings a groſſe and fulſome leafe, and this here a delicate and ſauorous; likewiſe of the nurture of this latter leafe, the Wormes commonly make a good end; the which happens very rarely of the other, yet that <note place="margin">The fifth place for good and wholeſome leaues.</note>is by the meeting of a kindly ſeaſon. The leaues of Mulberries will be well qualified as appertaineth, if you plant them in a leane place, &amp; far from ſprings of water, prouided that they he expoſed to the Sun, for with the Vines, the Mulberries hate a watriſh and ſhadowie ſituation: in ſome there will bee the moſt aſſured foode, where thevines grow beſt. And though that the Vine, &amp; the Mulberries, to compare them together, brings forth more in a ſtrong ground then in a feeble; yet ſo it is that the little of their bearing being delicate, is more to bee prized then the abundance of that which is groſſe. Adding, that touching this cattell here, one cannot abuſe nor deceiue him in giuing him meate, contrary
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17690:13"/>
to his nature, for either he will refuſe to eate it, or ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it will neuer doe well. And this his delicate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, turnes to the profit of his maſter, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployes his leane grounds in Mulberries, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent occupies not his fertill plow-lands, which remaine to him francke, and not charged with theſe trees: of which the importunitie is very great oppreſſing by the rootes and branches, almoſt all ſorts of ſeede which can be ſowed neere them.

The leafe comming of the blacke Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <note place="margin">The ſilke takes his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the leafe.</note>makes the ſilke groſſe, ſtrong, and heauie: on the contrarie that of the white, fine, weake, and light: ſo different through diuerſitie of the nature of the leaues, wherwith the Wormes are nouriſhed, which they yeeld of their worke. For which many deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to compound theſe things in hope of profite, feed the Wormes with two ſorts of meates, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of times; that is to ſay at the beginning, with white leaues, to haue the ſilke fine; and in the ende with blacke to fortifie it, and make it weigh. In which alwaies they meete not: ſometimes the changing of the meate, as of the delicate, into groſſe, being not agreeable to the Wormes which are importuned and cloyed with it. Nor ſhall it be to purpoſe for the groſſe founding which one would giue to the ſilke, holding a contrarie way, to begin by the blacke leafe and ende by the white. So ſuch mingling of meates is not receiued in the great feedings of the Silke-wormes, but only where
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17690:15"/>
the leafe of the white Mulberrie is rare, inuented for neceſſitie. For the moſt aſſured, it ſhall be all of one victell, wherewith we will nouriſh our Wormes, and that of the moſt profitable, which yeeldes to ſilke; the which how much the more fine it is, ſo much the more prized, and in the enſuing ſo much more money it giueth, the end &amp; period of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines. And yet though that the white leafe makes the ſilke feeble and light, you muſt not for that ſet it behind the blacke: ſeeing the ſame diſcords not ſo much in his qualities from that comming of the blacke leafe, but that there remaines force enough for the moſt exquiſite workes, and weight ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to bring in reaſonable ſummes. This is in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that ſilke there, that this is held light and weake: ſuch being the difference betweene groſſe and ſubtill things. Neuertheleſſe one muſt not be ſo ſcrupulous, as vtterly to reiect the blacke Mulberries for the ſilke, but only for the mingling of the food, it being not permitted in the nouriſhing of them, but by conſtraint, as I haue ſaide. Touching that which remaines, there are countries where they are very profitable for this buſines: as in diuers places of <hi>Lumbardie,</hi> and hitherwards in <hi>Anduze,</hi> and <hi>Alez,</hi> and in other places towards the <hi>Seuenes</hi> of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where great profit is made of the ſilke which comes of the blacke Mulberries. And although that ſuch ſorts of ſilke for the groſenes, be but of little price, in reſpect of the other, yet leaueth it not for that, but to bring in a good reuenue, conſidering the quantitie. Iointly that for the ſale, it is found neceſſary, though it be courſe, in many works in which it is imployed.</p>

It is to be noted, that to plucke off the leaues bringes great damage to al trees, oftentimes euen cauſing them to dye: but ſeeing that the Mulberry is deſtined to that, it naturally ſupporteth ſuch tempeſt better then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other plant: yet neuertheleſſe you muſt goe to it very retentiuely, for to diſleaue the Mulberrie inconſideratlie is the way to ſcorch them, for euer, to cauſe them miſerably to die in languiſhment. Euery one confeſſeth that to gather the leaues with both hands, leafe after leafe, without touching the ſhoote, is the moſt aſſured way for conſeruation of the trees; but yet the moſt expenſiue, becauſe of the great number of neceſſarie perſons for ſuch worke. For to ſpare coſt, the vulgar proceedes in an other ſort, which is in ſtripping of the leaues by handfuls, the which cannot be done but that often the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are barked and ſliued, whereby at the length the trees periſh. And alſo this gathering corrupts and ſoyles the leaues, to the detriment of the Wormes, when in taking them after the faſhion, as they vſe to milke kine, one cruſhes them, as though one would make the ioyce come forth: and moſt oftentimes with vncleane handes, cauſing them to haue an ill ſmell and ſauour.</p>

The moſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17690:20"/>
common remedie for that, is to make prouiſion of leaues for two or three daies, perceiuing the time to be giuent to rayne, for it is as well kept good, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that one laies it in a neate place, freſh ayred, and for to preſerue it from getting of heates, oftentimes a day turning it vpſide downe. And although that the rayne preſſe not, yet what faire weather euer be, one ought neuer to remaine without leaues: not ſo much for feare to haue need, as for the quality of the victual, in ſo much that it is better being a little kept, as twelue or fifteene houres before it bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the creature, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming directly from the trees. If the rayne preſſing driues you backe from gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo many leaues as you neede, make recourſe to this ſhort way, which is, to cut the branches of the Mulberries that you deſtine to bee diſſheaded the next yeere: the which with all their boughes, you ſhall make to be carried into the houſe, where han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as raiſons vnder the bearers, planchers or other couertures in an ayrie place, as in barnes and hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lofts, being then almoſt emptie, their leaues will drie well and quickly; yea in the one and the other you ſhall find much more perfection, then by any other way whatſoeuer. For neither to winnow them with cloathes, nor to drie them at the fire, are not of ſuch efficacie as is this meanes: by the which, beſides that it winnes much time, becauſe there needs nothing but certaine ſtrokes with a hatchet, for to take all the leaues of a tree. Do not doubt that that will diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Mulberries, but that on the contrary doth reioyce them, ſo quickly putting them to ſhoote forth more ſtrongly, whereby they winne time; for

the enſuing yeere, ſuch haſtie cutting cauſing their great encreaſe of branches. In the which, although it ſeemeth that the hot ſeaſon is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary for ſuch work, yet ſo it is, that experience manifeſts daily the nature of the Mulberries, yea of many other trees, to endure to be cut in the ſommer. For the which commodity ioyned the ſauing in this buſines, reſolue you not to cauſe to be gathered the leaues of your Mulberries in any other faſhion that you ſhall deliberate to pole the firſt, keeping them for the raynie daies, as hath been ſaid, or the time remaining faire, for the end of the food.

A thing which you ſhall find to come to good purpoſe, for the great ſpoyle of leaues that the Wormes make in that time, being then their greateſt deuouring, attending that with moderate labour, and much facilitie, abundance of victual is furniſht for them. The winning of time is adioyned to this buſines, becauſe that the morning beſtowed to this diſleauing, (otherwiſe loſt by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the dewes, during the which, it is forbidden to touch the leaues,) for that the branches of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries cut with their boughes, being the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone before carried into the houſe, are diſleaued very earely the morning following, the which one beſtowes in the worke, and that is done in tarrying till that by the Sun, or windes, the dewes be cleared from off the trees. <note place="margin">To diſhead the Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note>

A loſſe which one neede not feare, the tables being in ſuch ſorte ſitted, for each to reoeiue the Wormes, falling from his higher next to it, the which are not offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded at all through the little diſtance of one table to another. The breadth of the moſt loweſt table, ſhall be limited euen to this proportion, that eaſily of one ſide a man with his hand may reach to the middle, for to tend the Wormes. As for the others, their deminiſhing will make eaſie the ſeruing them, by meaſure as one ſhall goe vp on high, and ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach neer the ſeeling. Many of ſuch skaffolds ſhall be erected in euery part, hall or chamber, after his capacitie, and in ſuch manner, that any touch not the walles, for feare of rats: and likewiſe for to be able of all ſides to giue victuals commodiouſlie to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: betweene the which skaffolds one ſhall leaue way large enough, eaſily there to paſſe and repaſſe. One ſhall alſo take carefull heed, to make verie firme the skaffolds; to the ende that the Wormes growing great doe not cauſe ſome part to fall, (as heretofore that hath chaunced me with loſſe,) and that they doe not ſhake by the weight of the ladders which are ſet againſt them, going to viſit the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but ſhall remaine aſſuredly firme vnto the end, for that cauſe ſparing neither wood nor Iron. There are diuers ſorts of ladders which are made for this ſeruice according to fanſie.

With great curioſitie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let vs ſearch the moſt profitable graine, reiecting that, the worth whereof is ſuſpected; In the proofe conſiſteth the moſt ſure knowledge of this ſeede, though there bee many directions to diſcerne the good, from the il. Amongſt al the ſeeds of Wormes, whereof wee haue knowledge, till now, wee haue held that of <hi>Spaine,</hi> for the beſt, fructifying very well, through all the prouinces of this Realme, where they make a trade of this feeding. That of <hi>Calabria,</hi> ſince certaine yeeres, hath woon the repute, not ſo much for the goodneſſe of the ſilke that it brings forth, as for the abundance that comes of the cod which is great, in reſpect of that of <hi>Spaine.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they both be hard, an aſſured ſigne of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of matter, and by ſuch reaſon one is to bee preferred before the other: the qualitie winning the prize, the ſeede of <hi>Spaine</hi> ſhall be held in the firſt rancke, in expecting that by reiterated proofes, wee
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:17690:25"/>
cannot reaſonably ſet it behind any other. As for the graine which of long time is naturalized in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and thoſe neighbouring parts, one muſt make no great account of it, neither for the finenes nor for the quantity of ſilke that it makes: for how exquiſit ſoeuer the ſeede of ſilke Wormes is, tranſported from far in to ſuch quarters, it doth not continue long in goodneſſe, but degenerates at the end of certaine yeeres: the graine which is directlie brought from <hi>Spaine,</hi> the firſt yeere it doth not ſo well, as the three or foure yeeres following: the which being paſſed, it beginneth to decline in his goodneſſe. In the graine it ſelfe, is alſo knowne of the changing by the time, and in his body, and in his colour. For comming directly from <hi>Spaine,</hi> it is little, of a darke tawny colour; and kept, waxeth great, and growes bright, till then, that at the terme of certaine yeeres, it becomes gray, as gray cloth. The graine of Silk-wormes of they <hi>Seuenes</hi> of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc</hi> is ſo qualified, the which as well for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per natures, as for being feed with the leaues of blacke Mulberries, brings forth cods or bottoms great, and ſoft, by conſequent ſmally furniſht with ſilke, of an orenge colour, or gold yellow, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting the groſſeneſſe of the ſilke from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the fine comming of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſeede, the Wormes of which haue been nouriſhed with the leaues of white Mulberries, and the moſt part of bottoms are white, incarnadines, of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of fleſh. Behold the iudgement, that one can make of the knowledge of the goodneſſe, of the ſeede of <hi>Spaine:</hi> the beſt of which will bee the

ſmalleſt and moſt darke of colour; prouided it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue and not child with cold: the which is proued on the naile, in all ſeedes of the Silk-wormes: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpting for good, that which breaks in cracking, caſting forth humor and moiſture. The littleneſſe of the graine of <hi>Spaine</hi> makes the number of Wormes, the which ioyned with the hardneſſe of the bottoms cannot chuſe but make abundance of ſilke, which for his finenes is of great requeſt. Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently all ſeede comming directly from <hi>Spaine</hi> is not ſuch as you ſhall deſire, there being countries in that kingdome better for this, ſome then other: and that the more honeſtly to make it vp, there go rather truſty, then deceitfull perſons. Of the which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities you ſhall take heede, to the end ſo much the more profitably to ende your feeding, as with <note place="margin">Euery foure yeeres to change the ſeede.</note>more art you ſhall haue begun it.

Setting this article the fartheſt off, it is moſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to keepe curiouſly the ſeed during all the yeere, preparing in good time, eaſily to hatch them in the ſeaſon.

The long kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the ſeed with you, helpes to naturalize it in your ayre, whereby it hatcheth better and rather then hauing not at all abid with you: wherefore it is requiſite to furniſh your ſelfe of ſeede imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the gathering of the ſilke, if it may bee done, to doe it without any delaying; you muſt abſtaine from viſiting too often the graine of Wormes, eſpecially the ſpring approaching, for feare that by ſuch curioſity, one treades not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrie to his loſſe. The time to put to hatch this graine cannot bee directly aſcertaind, for that the ſeaſon being forward or backward, entirely gouerns the worke; cauſing the ſhooting forth, or ſtay of the Mulberries, the only victual of theſe creatures. This <note place="margin">In what time.</note>ſhall be then the true point, that then when the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries

For there needes but one repaſte to be giuen them, to make them all periſh of the flix, that ſuch new leaues, will bring them; becauſe that by their tenderneſſe the little beaſts, eates them with ſo auidous and greedy an affection, that they fill themſelues till they burſt. Wherefore this ſhall be for a maxime, that the Silk-wormes ſhall be alwaies <note place="margin">A notable maxime.</note>fedde with leaues of their owne age, to the end that by good correſpondencie, the leaues be as tender, and hard, as the creatures ſhall be feeble, and ſtrong, according to the time of their ordinarie commings.

            <p>The extremities of the colds and heates, the too much or too little feeding; and the feeding them with naughty leaues, are the principall cauſes of the extraordinary malladies of theſe creatures. If they be annoyed by reaſon of cold, one ſhall ſuccor them by warmeth in ſhutting the lodging, as before in perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it with frankincenſe and other ſweete matters: to the which perfume ſome addes lard and ſauſages cut in little ſlices, the ſmell alſo of good wine, ſtronge vineger, and <hi>Aqua-uitae</hi> comfort theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures hauing caught cold.

The lodging being not ſo well diſpoſed as is neceſſary, the Wormes ſhall be caried by tables forth into the ayre, to make them gather breath, halfe an houre before Sunne riſing. The diet is the true means to heale thoſe, which by too much feeding are become diſeaſed; one ſhall giue them nothing for two daies together, the which being paſt, they ſhall be fed very moderately, and a little at once: As alſo little and often it behoueth to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The which foreſeeing in fit time, you ſhal cauſe to be prepared neceſſarie rods, for the climing vp of the Wormes, to vomit their ſilke, faſtning their webs vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To aſſemble the Worms (ſo called in ſuch worke) many things are good, but not any greene bowes, for danger to offend the cattell, they waxing freſh, placed in the worke, as they will doe, the time being giuen to raine. The moſt proper matters, are Roſemary, Kneeholme, cuttings of Vines, Broome, ſhoots of Cheſtnut trees, of Okes, Oſiers, Salowes, Elmes, Aſhes; &amp; in ſumme, of all other trees or flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhrubs, hauing not ill ſmelles.

they are very difficult, going to it fantaſtickly, and there they are as it were perfumed by the agreeable ſent of the ſhrubbes, whereby they trauaile freely in ſuch place to the profit of the worke.</p>
            <p>At the ſeuenth or eight day then, that your Wormes ſhall bee come forth of their laſt change or diſeaſe (ſuch a diſeaſe being verie properlie called a chaunge, through the great ſicknes they then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, more vehemently then in any other, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to die) you ſhall remoue them to the tables, ſo furniſhed with twigges without looking to ſhift their places or litter any more. There you ſhall feed them as accuſtomedly, that is to ſay, with all abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, without denibiting them till then, that you ſhal ſee the moſt luſtieſt Wormes to enter the roods, which is when they take their courſe to get vp; which perceiued by their extraordinarie counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance wandring through the troope, in skattering, without making account of the meate, and a little after you ſhall ſee them to clime by the feete of the twigges, forſaking their foode, going to vomit, or rather to ſpinne their ſilke. From that time you ſhall begin to diminiſh their ordinary, day by day, in the end for to giue them nothing at all; when they ſhall haue vnited and grafted with the twigges, all the troope will haue forſaken the table, or few will faile, none remaining behind but the latter and idle ones. In this time is knowne thoſe which were long a hatching, by climing vp the laſt: being a neceſſary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequence, that the firſt comming forth, are the firſt ſpinning. And as there is no great reckoning to bee made of the hatching later; no more behoues it to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:17690:38"/>
make account of the idle Wormes that clime not. Wherefore at the ende of three or foure daies, that the firſt ſhall haue taken the twigges, you ſhall take <note place="margin">To gather the idle ones to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note>away the reſt from al the tables, for to aſſemble them in one, and ſo to nouriſh them till their end. So the forward and the backward Wormes will ſpinne their ſilke: the which they cannot doe fitly when without ſuch diſtinction the latter ſhould caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues on the worke of the formoſt, with great loſſe, and this apparent daunger, that before theſe had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their work, the Butterflies of the formoſt by ſuch <note place="margin">How long time they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow to ſpinne their ſilke.</note>longneſſe, alreadie formed in the codde, ſhould not come forth to the detriment of the enterpriſe.

            <p>Behold the ſilke made, this is not for all that the end of the labour of the Wormes; for it is by the graine that they end to worke and to liue, finiſhing their life by their deere ſeede which they leaue vs, for to renue themſelues by euery yeere, and by this meanes to conſerue for vs the poſſeſſion of the ſilke as to their heires. Miracle of nature, A Worme to be ſhut vp in his bottom of ſilke, is there transformed into a Butterflie! He imployes ten dayes to that, at the end of other ten dayes he comes forth through a

I haue ſhewen the ſcope of this Worme to be, after hauing weaued the ſilke, to goe to laye her egges, to perpetualize her ſelfe amongſt vs. For which it behoueth, to limit &amp; bound his natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, for feare that leauing it to do at pleaſure, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of ſilke, which wee haue of this buſines, wee ſhould haue nothing but ſleaue. Becauſe that the Worme being conuerted into a Butterflie to laye the egges, as I haue ſaid, comes forth of the bottom, <note place="margin">and</note>which for ſuch cauſe he pierſeth. Being thus bored the threeds of the ſilke are found broken, by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent indeuidable, and not to be wonde off, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one is conſtrained to carde ſuch matter as wooll, afterwards for to ſpinne it: which by this meanes loſing his gloſſe wherein conſiſteth the chiefeſt bewtie of the ſilke, wanting the ſame is turned into ſleaue.

In ſuch quantitie as one ſhall deſire, according to this reckoning, that an ounce of ſeede commonly iſſues from a hundred females, ſeldome more, by the accoupling of the like number of males. By curious finding out ſome hold that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry femall laies a hundred egges or graines; and therefore an ounce of ſeede to conteine tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand graines: but for the inequalitie of the ſeedes and waights, that cannot euery where agree, nor in euery ſort of grain. Some for ſparing, put two femals to one male, beleeuing that it ſufficeth: but becauſe of the incertentie of the ſucceſſe, and the great care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe requiſit in this place, for to couple them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, from time to time, the beſt ſhall be to reſt vpon that which experience hath authoriſed for good, that is, in putting to ſo many males, as females. <note place="margin">Of their ſex.</note>The coddes incloſing the male Butterflies, are ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and long; thoſe whereout the females come, are thicke and great in the midſt: and both of them more ſharpe in one place then in the other, agreeing to the figure of an egge. The moſſie ones at both endes, hauing not any point, or very little, are not to be deſired; but rather the race to periſh, for the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie that one findes to wind off the ſilke, it being not poſſible, how one ſhould handle them, to wind all the ſilke out of the cawthern, by reaſon of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſnarlings which happens in the bottoms which are of this ſhape, (not in others) hindring them to diuide, a thing very conſiderable, both for the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of the ſilke, and qualitie: for neither ſo much ſilke, nor ſo faire will it yeeld, being mingled with

that the femals lay their ſeede more eaſie being hanged ouer the males, then laine flat vpon a table.

By ſuch order one cannot vſe the proofe, of wine, nor peiſe the egges to know what quantitie of Wormes you will charge your ſelfe with; by which, confuſion may happen in the feeding them.

But becauſe that within ſeuen or eight daies, one can very hardly winde off all the ſilke of a reaſonable feeding, for the great number of worke men that for that one ſhould employ, one ſhall keep both the one and the other of theſe two waies, that is, in ſetting themſelues a work to winde off the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, ſo ſoone as euer one ſhall perceiue to bee a number of perfect ones, caſting them directly from the twigges into the baſen, hauing firſt pilled and bared them of their ſleaue, without other delay.

to kill the Butterflies of the reſt which one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to keepe, to the intent that the creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead within, the coddes remaine exempt from feare to bee bored, and by conſequent reſerued for good ſilke, may atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the leaſure of the winder. That <note place="margin">The means to kill the Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flies in the coddes.</note>is done in expoſing and laying the coddes in the ſunne, the heate of which ſtifles the creature in his proper worke: but you muſt vſe a meane, for feare of burning the ſilke. Three or foure times in ſundrie daies the coddes ſhal be ſet in the ſun, &amp; at each time they ſhall remaine two houres before noone, and as much after, to the end that the great heate of that part of the day may readily ſtifle the Wormes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be metaphoriſed or changed into Butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flies: which will come to paſſe in ſpreading the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms vpon ſheetes, and oftentimes remouing them to make them all feele it, without excepting any from the heate of the ſunne: neuertheleſſe to take heed to the charge, that by too rude handling one bruiſes not the Wormes within the coddes, for feare of ſtayning the ſilke with the matter of their bodies; the which (as hath been ſaid) doth ſo glue together the ſilke, that it is impoſſible afterwards to winde it off. Therefore very ſoftly oftentimes a day one ſhall remoue them from one ſide to another, afterwards they ſhal be heaped warmely together, and wrapped vp in the ſheets, and ſo carried into a freſh chamber, not into a danke celler, as to il purpoſe ſome do. The ſunne failing (as often times it comes to paſſe, that the skie is clouded) you ſhall vſe an ouen moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heated, as it ſhall be two houres after the drawing of bread; within the which by ſackfuls, one ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:17690:44"/>
put the coddes, which ſhall be laid vpon boords, for feare that the ſtones of the ouens bottom ſhould burne them. There they ſhall remaine an houre, or an houre and a halfe, in reiterating the manner, till that you ſhall know the creatures to bee certainely dead, the which you ſhall be reſolued without great loſſe, in re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding one of the moſt ſuſpectedſt bottoms, for to ſee the inner part. In the meane time you ſhall take heed, not to burne your ſilke by too vehement heate, foreſeeing which, the moſt ſure way ſhall bee to heate the ouen a little at once, and to returne ſo much the oftener, then too much, and ſo haſting loſe all the worke. This ſmothering of the Wormes, or Butterflies already formed, is of great import, for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it either ignorantly, or retchleſſely, not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king heed whether that the Butterflies ſhould come forth of the coddes, according to their nature, or not being able at all to take the ayre, ſhould remaine in the way, after to be forced to paſſe further, nibbling the inner part of the coddes: of the which little ſilke can come afterwards, and that yet not very wel qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified. Ill comparable to that of the Rats in this point differing, that the Rats gnaw the exterior of the cods, for to eate vp the creature which is there inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and the Butterflies the interior to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. The bottoms ſo prepared ſhall attend the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the winder. But this ſhall be no longer then that without delay you may conſerue the ſilke in his naturall beautie, without loſſe of waight: in the one and in the other, being ſo much the more defrauded of it, as more longer the coddes ſhall bee kept.

In like manner is augmented the difficultie of winding it off; wherby the ſilke breaks with dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the quantitie: and by long keeping, the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is empaired. To theſe loſſes, diligence remedies, ſo that there be not giuen too much time to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms to ouer-harden, the ſilke wil be wonde off well enough: the winding whereof ſhall be continued, without diuerting to other vſes, vntill the laſt bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.

               <note place="margin">The taske of the winder.</note> Of the bottoms come of Wormes of a good race, and fed with the leaues of white Mulberries, it ſhall ſuffice that the work-man winds off a pound and a halfe by day <hi>Paris</hi> weight, little leſſe, for by ſuch limit it will be ſmall enough to be appropriated to all vſes, and for that more vendable, than being groſſer.

The which the Merchants fearing, at the ſight of the groſſe skeanes, buy willingly all the ſilke, by that aſſuring

themſelues not to be any intermixed confuſion, nor fraudulent mingling, in the winding vp.

The work-man ſhall make two skeanes of ſilke by day, or foure, if to that his wheele and his other skill be appropriated; for that the ſilke ſhewes fairer in little skeans, or skarfes, than in great ones; as that by beſtowing more faſtenings tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they do breakings of the ſilke, but in one only skeane: by this meanes they ſell it for as much as the other; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is the commodity of the Mercha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which put it in worke, being more proper to be giuen to be wonde in a little, than in a great volume.</p>
            <p>The remainder of the winding which cannot be wonde with the skeanes, as the breakings off of the ſilke, and that which will not bee got off, reſting in the baſon, ſhall be husbanded for to be wrought in tapiſtries, for Carpets, Chaires, Beds, and ſuch like moueables of the houſe; intermingling theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with wooll, hempe, flaxe, cotton &amp;c.

So it happened to me touching the knowledge of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of the barke of the white Mulberrie. For by the eaſie ſeparation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his wood, being in ſappe, in hauing cauſed to be made cords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (after the imitation of thoſe of the rinde of <hi>Tillet,</hi> which they make in <hi>France,</hi> euen at the <hi>Louure</hi> in <hi>Paris)</hi> and put to drie at the top of my houſe, were by the windes throwne into the ditch, afterwards were taken forth of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17690:49"/>
muddie water, hauing remained there foure daies, and waſhed in faire water, and then vntwiſted, and dried, I ſaw appeare the downe or thrum, the matter of linnen, like to ſilke or fine flax. I made theſe barkes to bee beaten with mallets, to ſeparate the ſheds, which going to duſt, left the gentle and ſoft ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance remaining: the which barke, hetcheld and combde after the manner of hempe and flaxe, was made proper to ſpinne; and in enſuing, hath been wouen and reduced into cloath. More then thirtie yeers afore I employed the barke of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der ſhoots of whit Mulberries, to bind graffes in the skutchion, in ſteede of hempe, which they commonly vſe in ſuch delectable buſines.</p>
            <p>Behold the firſt proofe of the value of the barke of the white Mulberrie: the which accident, brought into art, is not to be doubted, but to draw good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice from ſuch inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the white Mulberrie being repleat with ſo many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, to the great profit of his poſſeſſor. The barke of <hi>Tillet</hi> beſides that it ſerues to make ropes, as hath been ſaid, is ſomewhat tractable to be made in clothes: but that is in very groſſe work, as for to ſerue in wind-mill ſayles, and ſuch like things. The nettle yeelds an exquiſit mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherof is made fine &amp; delicate cloths: but there is ſo little of it that they cannot make other recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it then for curioſitie. There are alſo certaine other herbes and ſhrubbes yelding thrum or downe, but ſome ſo weake, others in ſo ſmall a quantitie, ſome ſo groſſe, and with ſo great difficultie to bee drawne off, that it is not poſſible to vſe them to any profit, or to very little. It is not ſo of the white Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berrie,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17690:49"/>
whereby the abundance of branching, the facilitie of disbarking, the goodnes of Thrumme or Downe proceeding from that, makes this buſineſſe moſt aſſured: yea verily with very ſmall expence the maſter ſhall draw infinit commodities from this rich tree. The worth whereof vnknowne to our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors hath remained interred &amp; buried vntil now, as by the eyes of vnderſtanding it ſhall be knowne, yet better by experiences. But to the end that they may make this buſines durable, that is to ſay, to draw off the barke of the Mulberrie, without offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, this here ſhall be noted; that for the good of the ſilke, it is neceſſarie to prune, to cut, and diſhead the Mulberries, immediatly after hauing gathered the leaues for the foode of the Wormes; neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe according to requiſit diſtinction, as I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated; whence the branches comming of ſuch cuttings, ſhall ſerue for our intention: for that, that being then in ſap (as in other time you muſt neuer put the bil to the trees) they will very eaſily disbark: and this ſhall bee to make profit of a loſt thing, for elſe they ſhould be caſt into the fire. Likewiſe the ſame cuttings cannot but ſerue well; if they loue them no better, for the firſt, to vſe them in fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of gardens, Vines &amp;c. where ſuch branches are very proper, for their hard ſnagges, being drie and of long ſeruice, through which durableneſſe they rot not in a great time; from whence finally taken, for their laſt profit ſhall be burnt in the kitchen.</p>
            <p>And becauſe that the diuers qualities of the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches diuerſifie the value of their barkes, whence the moſt fine proceeds fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the tender tops of the trees, the groſſe ones from the great braunches alreadie
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17690:50"/>
hardned, the meane ones from thoſe which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene both. Then when they ſhall cut the trees, be it in pruning them, disbranching or diſheading them, the branches ſhall bee ſorted, ſetting apart in bundels euery ſort, to the end that without confuſed mingling all the barks may be drawne off, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led according to their particular properties. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay the ſaid rindes ſhall be ſeparated from the branches vſing the fauour of the ſap, which paſſeth quickly, without which they cannot worke in this buſines. And hauing bundled vp the barkes, of all the three ſortes a ſunder, they ſhall be laide in cleane or foule water, as ſhal be fit three or foure daies more or leſſe according to their qualities and places where they are, the trials whereof ſhall limit the terme, but in what part ſoeuer they bee, the tender and ſmall would be leſſe ſteeped, than the big and great ones; being taken forth of the water, at the approch of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening they ſhall bee ſpread vpon the graſſe in a meadow, if conueniently you may, or elſewhere, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the the aire, hauing vntide their fardels, for to remaine there all the night, to the end to drink vp the dewes of the morning; then before the Sunne lightes vpon them, they ſhall be heapte together, till the returne of the euening; then put againe in the dew, and taken from thence at Sun riſing, as afore, continuing that ten or twelue daies, after the maner of flaxe, (and in ſum) vntil then, that you ſhall know all the ſtuffe to be ſufficiently watered, by the proofe that you ſhal make in drying, and beating a handfull of each of the three ſorts of the barks, laying thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in the dew which ſhall not be ready enough,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17690:50"/>
and withdrawing the reſt, as you ſhal find by the eie.</p>
            <p>It hath been recited here before, that for to haue profit of feeding the Silk-wormes, with leſſe then two or three thouſand trees, the Mulberrie-yarde ought not to be enterpriſed; and that well for to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne them, to the purpoſe to haue long ſeruice of them, it is requiſit, that there be lopped euery yeere, the tenth or twelfth part, ſo by that there may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheaded, euery yeere, from two hundred and fiftie, to three hundred Mulberries, which will alwaies yeeld betweene three or foure hundred burthens of wood &amp; more. To which qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity, adding that which they take off from the trees immediatly after their diſleauing in pruning &amp; topping them, there will be abundance of braunches, and by conſequent abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of barke euery yeere, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which wil ariſe much worke of diuers ſorts, according to requiſit ſortings.</p>
            <p>But yet the maſter of our worke ſhall not reſt here but ſhall plant woodes of white Mulberries, to cut low the moitie of them euery yeere; for ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe diuiding them into two partes, from whence he ſhall haue braunches delicat and young, the barke whereof will bee proper to make fine and exquiſit linnen. And the ſaid woodes will not be onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to furniſh euery yeere, abundance of new barke, but alſo faggoting to burne; and poles for arbors in gardens, and to make hoopes for tubbes and barrels, chuſing for this the greateſt branches. Alſo to giue the leaues for to feede Silk-wormes, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering them in the beſt aired and ſunnieſt parts of the trees. And for the augmenting of good husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie, <note place="margin">The 12. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the book of Husbandry.</note>to feede an infinit number of connies, prouided
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17690:51"/>
that the woodes bee incloſed for a warren after the manner before deſcribed. So there will be foure notable commodities, which the maſter ſhall reape from theſe woodes: which for the ſpoyle that the connies may do in disbarking the feet of the trees in winter, as they doe all ſorts of plants, a few excepted, he ſhal not leaue himſelfe vnfurniſht of ſo profitable a beaſt. Wherefore ſomewhat to amend ſuch a fault, helping the connies to meate, it behoueth not but to ſowe oates in certaine places and great allies, which for ſuch purpoſe ſhall bee left emptie in the woods, where the connies may feede during the coldes, by ſo much ſparing the Mulberries: for the ſuccoring of which, beſides, you ſhall cauſe to bee throwne to the connies, the outcaſts of your garden, hay, cuttings of Vines, and other druggeries in winter, then when the ſnowes conſtraines theſe cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell to goe to the trees, for want of other foode. Yet for the fifth commoditie, I will adde here, that the leaues of Mulberries, in what place ſoeuer they bee planted, falling of themſelues to the ground in the end of ſummer, put together in ſome ſeparated loft, taken from thence day by day, and giuen boyled to ſwine, keepes them in good ſtate, beginning to put them into fleſh: the which comes to them, when in enſuing, there fals a good maſt, whereby they grow to the ſuperlatiue degree of fatneſſe.</p>
            <p>I would couch here for the ſixth commodity the Mulberries fruite of theſe trees, ſo much loued of poultrie, for their exceeding ſweetneſſe, if the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Mulberrie leafe for the Wormes, were not the meanes for vs to make profit: the which
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17690:51"/>
puld from the trees with the leaues, yet greene, long before their maturitie, remaine nothing worth, whereby no certaine account can be made.</p>
            <p>All the which things, bringes to light the worth of the Mulberrie, a tree filled with the bleſſing of God, which in this only plant giues to all ſortes of men, and eſtates, theſe excellent matters, for to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and apparrell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, according to their affections. The ſoyle proper for the Mulberrie to beare agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble foode for the Wormes, is that ſame which the Vine deſireth. Wine is healthfull for the Wormes, fortifying, preſeruing and curing their diſeaſes. And as the Vine beginnes to bring forth good wine, in his fifth or ſixt yeere, ſo in like age the Mulberrie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to beare leaues, very good to nouriſh the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, an obſeruation heretofore alreadie marked. Hauing made theſe two excellent plants here to march in companie, it ſhall not be to ill purpoſe in continuing to repreſent their ſympathies, to ſay, that the ſpirit of wine, by diſtillation, is conuerted into water of life: So the quint-eſſence of the Mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie yeelded in the leafe, is from thence extracted by the Worme, which turnes it into ſilke, the earthly matter remaining in the wood, of the which, yet the moſt digeſted part, yeeldes in the bark, from whence it is taken, as hath been ſeene. But to enter fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the conſideration of ſuch ſecrets of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that would bee to ſurpaſſe the limits of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, which is not to treate in this place but of the barke of the white Mulberrie, for to gather the riches which therein is hidden. So my diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not diuing to the Center, ſhall reſt themſelues at the Superficiall.</p>
