            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

one ſort of preſumers as to countenance the other. All ſorts of Governours are here united in my Text, both the ſupreame and ſubordinate: and may they never be disunited among us; cenſorious or bitter ſpeeches againſt both kinds are ſeverely prohibited, <hi>Thou ſhalt not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>God himſelfe had now made knowne the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law in ten precepts, upon Mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> having a Legiſlative power derived to him from God himſelfe, propounds Ceremoniall and judiciall precepts to the people: The one ſort to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe thoſe formalities wherewith God would be worſhipped, the other, to order their politicall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for the better maintaining humane ſociety in that populous Common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> This latter ſort of judiciall Lawes, we ſhall find to begin in the firſt verſe of the former chapter, where we ſhall finde them intituled judgements, which God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſet before them. <hi>Judgements quia ſunt leges ſecundum quas judicandum eſt,</hi> becauſe they were Lawes according to which judgement in judiciall tryalls, was to proceed in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Many particular Lawes there are to prevent private injuries betwixt man and man, and here in this precept the Law giver addes a peremptory precept, for deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment towards publike perſons, <hi>Thou ſhalt not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:156581:6"/>It is indeed, a Morall precept in its owne nature: a ſtreame derived from the fountain of the fift Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement (as thoſe are the ſtrongeſt and moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging judiciall Lawes, which have neereſt depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Morall Law) and therefore is of perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall efficacy, and obligeth all to perpetuall obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but is here placed among the judiciall or poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticque Lawes for double reaſon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe it concerned the policy or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Common-wealth, the duty of men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe upon breach of this precept the Delinquents ſhould be proceeded againſt by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Magiſtrate, and in a judiciall courſe, puniſhment be inflicted. This was now made a penall ſtatute to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> aſwell as it was a branch of a morall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and though we find not the nature or degree of the puniſhment expreſſed (becauſe God leaves that arbitrary to Magiſtrates, who would be forward enough to puniſh indignities to themſelves) yet is it moſt probably conjectured to be no leſſe than death it ſelfe, for notorious open railing upon the higheſt Magiſtrate. He that railed on his Father or Mother, was to be put to death, Chap. 21.17. and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no leſſe was he to ſuffer, who ſhould curſe and revile them who were <hi>publici parentes,</hi> the publique
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:156581:6"/>
parents of the Country: Neither was it more for blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt God, than blaſphemy againſt the King, that <hi>Naboth</hi> was ſtoned, though he was guilty of neither. What ever their judiciall puniſhments were in that Hebrew Common-wealth, that indeed obligeth not other nations to inflict the ſame, for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments were only nationall, and the indulgence of our Chriſtian Lawes, may perhaps not exact ſuch rigour; but ſtill the ſin muſt needs be as hainous as ever it was then. There is ſtill the ſame ſtampe or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon Magiſtracy, by the ſame Almighty hand, and the precept is no leſſe preſſing upon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians than upon Iews. <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Command you ſee is double: but the latter part is either exegeticall, of the former, by way of explication, or elſe it is emphaticall, to urge it on with vehemence by double repetition: yet may we juſtly find ſome aduantage from the variety or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the words, and therefore thus diſtribute them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Here is <hi>dignitas Magiſtratuum,</hi> the Magiſtrates dignity, and that firſt, of Magiſtrates in generall, they are all <hi>Dii</hi> Gods. Secondly of one Superior above the reſt: he is <hi>Princeps populi ſui</hi> the ruler of <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is <hi>officium privatorum,</hi> the duty of private men expreſſed in a double negative precept.

            <p>For firſt, they are <hi>Imagines Dei,</hi> Images of him who is the Vniverſall Ruler and Iudge of all; there is a repreſentation and reſemblance of the Deity in <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> more than in Common men; judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is comitted to them, which belongs ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly to him; ſome rayes and beames of his Majeſty, he hath made to ſhine in them, though not in all alike, for one Star may differ from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in glory: ſhadows and pictures may be made in ſeverall proportions, one piece may repreſent the

perſon only to the ſhoulders, another to the middle, ſome at full length; ſtill all are Images, and have a reſemblance: Inferiour and ſupreame Rulers there may be, but all have (more or leſſe) ſome of his likeneſſe: to have a power of Iudging and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring others, to have ſome ſplendor and honor above others, is a Character of Divinity; Gods they are as by their office and dignity they reſemble him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Gods they are <hi>quia Dei locum ſustinent tanquam legati &amp; vicarii,</hi> they ſuſteine the place and perſon of God to men, as his deputies and vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; God judgeth mediately by and through them, and executes thoſe things, which (were they not) he would immediatly do himſelfe; they do the works which God himſelfe would do: thus <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>(loco Dei)</hi> inſtead of God to <hi>Aaron, Exod.</hi> 4.15. thou ſhalt be to him in ſtead of God, that is, thou ſhalt give him councell, and direct him as my Oracle: and the ſame <hi>Moſes</hi> is called <hi>Pharaoh's God, Exod.</hi> 7.1 I have made thee Pharaoh's God, becauſe he ſhould execute Gods judgements upon him; God would execute judgement upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Thoſe who do thoſe actions, which belong to the Higheſt, as his Miniſters and Subſtitutes are <hi>Dii minorum gentium,</hi> they may be called petty inferior Gods, he hath ſo honored them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:156581:11"/>Thirdly, Gods, all Magiſtrats are, <hi>quia à Deo ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati,</hi> becauſe they are ordained of God, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> in expreſſe tearmes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. ordeined they are, not only permitted, but eſtabliſhed by providence, by precept; it is the ſame reaſon which our Saviour himſelfe gives of this title, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.34. he calleth them Gods (ſaith he) to whom the Word of God came, that is, <hi>cui ſpeciale venit dominandi mandatum,</hi> to whom the ſpeciall Word of God came to give them power to rule; there is no authority but is from God, he is not only the permitter but the author of it: All Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy is Gods Ordinance. Should we ſeek to the fountaine and originall of all power, we ſhall find God Almighty inveſting man with a threefold power at the firſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, with that which is called <hi>liberum arbitrium,</hi> free will: he erected in Man a Magiſtracy and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over himſelfe, <hi>ut <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Secondly, he gave a ſecond power, of man over the creatures, that he ſhould be Lord of them <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minamini animalibus terrae,</hi> rule ye over the beaſts of the earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.8.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:156581:11"/>Thirdly, he at that time gave a power of man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man, which when there were but two perſons could only be <hi>poteſtas maritalis in uxorem,</hi> the power of the husband over the wife; the Magiſtracy could only appeare in that, and in that it did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, in <hi>poteſtatem Patriam,</hi> into the paternall power of parents over their children.</p>
            <p>Then ſecondly, in <hi>potestatem herilem,</hi> into the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Maſters over Families, and as humane ſociety multiplied, ſo did God by the light of nature imprint in man a knowledge of the neceſſity of Order and Government, he taught them by their own bodyes, that ſome members muſt be ſuperior to others; and from the Bees and Cranes, Men learned to chooſe a Ruler over them. Indeed we find Magiſtracy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely inſtituted by that peremptory Law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. That whoſoever ſhed mans bloud by man ſhould his blood be ſhed; Now that any man ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly at his own pleaſure execute the Law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a murderer without warrant, would make him ſtill a murtherer, and introduce confuſion.

            <p>Rulers then are all of Gods appointment, they

Thus in that people Which he had taken into his owne ſpeciall immediate care, he ordained various ways of Government; by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> by aſſiſtance of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of 70 Elders; by Judges, and then by Kings, and ſo mediatly in ſeverall Common-wealths he ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſeverall Magiſtracies, though not by his owne immediate appointment yet by the agreement of men, ſuch as ſhall beſt conſiſt with the conſtitution of the People: and upon all thoſe he hath ſtamp'd the character of his authority, they are not raſhly to be diſobeyed or altered, they are Gods by his ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Yet there are ſcruples raiſed againſt this third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (that all Magiſtrates are called Gods, becauſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined by him) for ſome would take away the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it: Surely, ſay ſome Objectors, all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and their power cannot be from God.</p>

               <hi>Solu.</hi> It is true indeed, God ſpeaking there of the rending of the Kingdom from the ſon of <hi>Salomon</hi> by <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> ſaith, that they have ſet up Princes but not by him, and yet himſelfe tels <hi>Jeroboam</hi> by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <q>

               </q> In one place God ſaith the people had done it, in another, himſelfe had done it; ſurely then the rending of the Kingdome was from God as a juſt revenger for the ſins of <hi>Salomon;</hi> the rebellion of the people without conſulting with him, was not from him: <hi>Jeroboam's</hi> power was from him, though not the peoples rebellion and revolt; ſtill all authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty finds him for the author, and therefore they are called Gods.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Object.</hi> But ſecondly, they cannot all bee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined of God and ſo be ſtiled Gods for that reaſon, for then would all the worſt and moſt tyrannicall governments claime God for their Patron: hath he ordeined Tyrants, and made them Gods on earth? Did he appoint <hi>Nimrod</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> Did he ſet up the <hi>Babylonian</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Tyrants? Did he autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize

the <hi>Mahumetane Sultuns?</hi> and ſet up Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that prove ſcourges to the ſons of men?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solu<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> To anſwer this, we muſt firſt know that all tyranny is the corruption of Government; it is not that ſound and lawfull authority of which God is the author. Government and Governors have all their degenerations and corruptions, as Politique Writers deſcribe them, and theſe are not from God, but from the vices and wickedneſſe of men permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him for their puniſhment.</p>
            <p>There are three things which muſt be conſidered in all Governments, in every Ruler.</p>
            <p>There is firſt, <hi>ipſa poteſtas,</hi> the power it ſelfe, and this is by the Will and Ordinance of God, in whoſe hands ſoever it is, for by him Kings raigne, and though in anger he gives a King, yet ſtill he gives him <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.11.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is <hi>acquiſitio poteſtatis,</hi> the obteining of this power, this may often be by uſurpation, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt unlawfull meanes, and of this God is not the author, he may permit evill Governors, by forceable or unjuſt meanes, to get that power into their hands unlawfully, which himſelfe hath lawfully conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is <hi>Executio poteſtatis,</hi> the execution and uſe of that power, which if it be abuſive, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:156581:13"/>
the limits of Iuſtice, can no way be aſcribed to him, but to the wickedneſſe of men: Tyrannicall oppreſſion, eſtabliſhment of ſuperſtition and errour, by a lawfull, though an abuſed power, have no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Gods ordinance, they find no ſupport or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorization from him: Yet thoſe who execute them ſtill <hi>quoad poteſtatem,</hi> in reſpect of their power are from him, they are ordeined by him, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect are called Gods in Scripture.</p>
            <p>We muſt yet adde a fourth reaſon, why Magiſtrates are called Gods, and that the beſt and moſt proper <hi>quia Deum imitari debent,</hi> becauſe they are, or ſhould be like God himſelfe in their actions and qualities. They ſhould be well acquainted with his attributes; of Wiſdome, to diſcerne betwixt good and evill; of Juſtice to diſtribute to every one with an unpartiall hand; of Mercy in mitigating the utmoſt rigour of ſeverity. God hath in Scripture aſſumed the ſame ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles which he hath given to Rulers: he is <hi>Pastor Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> the Sheepheard of Irael, and they are (or ſhould be) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Sheepheards of the people. he is <hi>Salvator Iſraelis,</hi> the Saviour of Iſrael, they ſhould be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, deliverers of them (like him) in times of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. He is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the great Watchman over his people, &amp; they are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, watchmen alſo ſubordinate to him: They ſhould be like God in all their actions, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:156581:14"/>
in theſe two, firſt, <hi>in protegenda Eccleſia,</hi> in protecting Religion, and the Church of God; it is that whereof the higheſt takes the principall care, he by ordinary providence cares for the juſt and unjuſt, affords them all life, &amp; aire, &amp; raine, and ſunſhine, but his ſpecial eye is over his Church, how to preſerve his truth, and his ſervants; ſo ſhould earthly Magiſtrates ſhew themſelves <hi>ſimiles Deo,</hi> like Gods in this; Their care and their endeavour ſhould be principally fixed upon the eſtabliſhment of Religion, the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church; they can never be more like God, than when they do his worke, defend his truth, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his glory. Secondly, like him they ought to be in <hi>faciendo juſtitiam,</hi> in doing juſtice and judgement: God is knowne by this, that he is the great executer of juſtice and judgement, relieving the injured, vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating the oppreſſed, puniſhing the wicked, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding the righteous; then are Rulers truly like him when they do that which is correſpondent to theſe: thus did the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> tell <hi>Salomon,</hi> that the Lord his God ſet him upon the Throne for that end to do juſtice and judgement; It is the great end of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, and they properly deſerve the title of Gods, no longer than they reſemble him in that. Vnjuſt Magiſtrates have more of Sathan in them than of God, more of the God of this world, than of the true
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:156581:14"/>
God of heaven. Their power makes them like the higheſt, but their injuſtice like the father of wrongs: Properly and truly are they called Gods, when their wayes are like his. It is the generall title of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to be called Gods; here is another added, which ſeemes to be ſingular. <hi>The Ruler of thy people.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> was at this time conſtituted by God the principall Ruler of Iſrael, and ſo himſelfe particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might be thought to be deſigned by this expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>The Ruler of the people:</hi> yet Saint <hi>Paul</hi> applying this expreſſion to the high Prieſt, when he was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to have reviled him, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.4. calling him the Ruler of the people, implys that it is not wholy to be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to one, but to any ruler; yet certainly it may include an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> upon the ſupreame Ruler, where ſuch there is; if there be one Ruler of the people, whom God hath placed in more eminency than the reſt, (as Kings or Monarchs) the Command is principally given con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him: ſuch as was <hi>Moſes</hi> at this time, ſuch as was the High Prieſt in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> time, for he was then (excepting thoſe governours which the <hi>Romans</hi> ſet over the Jewes) the chiefe ruler in Iſrael. It is not indeed of abſolute neceſſity, that in every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there ſhould be one perſon honoured, with the title of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the ſole ruler of the people: for God
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:156581:15"/>
hath not expreſly impoſed it on all Nations: were the Queſtion to be diſcuſſed in generall, what Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment were beſt, it were not raſhly to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded for any one, Vniverſally to be the beſt: But that were beſt for every Nation, which would beſt conſiſt with the diſpoſition, and manners, and frame of the people. The mixture and contemperation of them, is without queſtion the moſt Vniverſally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and of longeſt duration; where there is one ſupreame Ruler, and yet ſupported with and ſtrengthened by repreſentative Counſellors, where there is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, one Chiefe, and yet <hi>plures Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarii,</hi> a multitude of Counſellors. When only one would rule without ſubordination of other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, the burthen muſt needs prove unſupportable: &amp; where each member would rule, there muſt needs be Ataxy and confuſion; where there is one ſuperior Ruler, and he ſtanding in <hi>Congregatione Principum, in coetu Deorum,</hi> in the congregation of Princes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the inferior Gods, there ſurely is the happieſt commixture, there may be expected with Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the fruits of a happy temper. It is (beloved) the happineſſe, wherewith God hath bleſſed our ſinfull Nation, that we have both parts of the ſubject of this precept in my Text. We have thoſe who are called Gods without flattery, wiſe, and juſt, and provident
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:156581:15"/>
Rulers. We have one <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a Ruler of the people, a gracious King, appointed by God over us, to do Iuſtice and Iudgement, eſtabliſhed in the Throne by long ſucceſſion, from many Anceſtors: May wee therefore joyne them together; and proceed to ſee what it is God Commands us concerning them, which is the ſecond Part of my Text, <hi>Thou ſhalt not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The command is not in tearmes affirmative and proportionable to the appellation.</p>
            <p>For firſt, it is not ſaid <hi>Deos adorabis,</hi> thou ſhalt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the Gods.</p>
            <p>Nor ſecondly is it ſaid, thou ſhalt flatter them. <hi>Non juſsi ſunt ſacrificiis adorari,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Austin,</hi> they are not commanded to bee honored with ſacrifices, though they are called Gods. It was the fooliſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Heathens, that they would indeed be ſtiled Gods, and have the people offer them ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, forgetting they ſhould dye like men. Though God give Rulers his own title, he would not have them arrogate it, ſo as to forget they are men: though he call them Gods, that men may honour them; yet he would not have them call themſelves ſo in the pride of their hearts: It was <hi>Lucifer's</hi> ſin to ſay <hi>ſimilis ero Altiſsimo,</hi> I will be like the Higheſt. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would he have private men ſuppoſe them to be

God eſſentially, and to forget him in reſpect of them, nor to aſcribe that honor to them, which is only due to himſelfe. It was the madneſſe of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Heathen to account <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> Gods in the likeneſſe of men, and to be ready to offer ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to them; may ſuch idolatry never bee found in knowing Chriſtians. There have beene no greater enemies to the happineſſe of Princes than flatterers: Nor is there any way ſpeedier to bring judgements upon Rulers and Nations, then when the due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſhall be taken from God, and aſcribed to men, which are but ſecondary ſubordinate inſtruments to convey them. For God is a jealous God, and though he give the title of <hi>Elohim,</hi> yet he will not give his glory to the ſons of men: While the people cry out to <hi>Herod,</hi> that it is the voyce of God and not of man, they draw down a ſudden vengeance upon him; for immediately the Angell of God ſmote him, and he is eaten with wormes, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.23. There con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the old verſe, <hi>deliraat Achivi Rex plectitur,</hi> the people flatter and the King is ſmitten.</p>
            <p>It was the frequent affirmation of the late He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick and Victorious King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> that he feared the peoples aſcribing too much of that glory to him, which was due to God, would bee a cauſe that God would remove him before the work was finiſhed;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:156581:16"/>
and perhaps it was a ſpeech too Propheticall. Wee muſt not aſcribe,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Gods Power, his Omnipotency to Princes and Rulers, as Flatterers have made weake Princes believe that they had power to do any thing, that their will was a Law, that <hi>Quicquid libet licet,</hi> that they ſhould be able to bring any deſigne to paſſe, be it never ſo impoſſible or unjuſt; this was <hi>Jeſabell</hi> to <hi>Ahab: dost thou now governe Iſrael, and canſt not do this?</hi> Whereas the power of earthly Gods is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed both by Law, and by the ſhort limits of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane power; they neither may nor can doe all things; they are <hi>Dii,</hi> but non <hi>Omnipotentes,</hi> they are Gods, but not Almighty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we muſt take heed we do not aſcribe to them Gods glory, that is, not make them the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt objects of our thankfulneſſe, or the firſt and prime cauſes of any happineſſe that betides us; we muſt looke beyond them in our deliverances, give glory to God on High, above thoſe on earth.</p>
            <p>Many eminent and unparalelled bleſſings God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hath conveyed (Beloved) upon this Nation, by meanes of thoſe who are called Gods amongſt us, our gracious King and Parliament, and more we expect by their meanes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is not worthy of a tongue or a heart, that will not acknowledge them; but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:156581:17"/>
take we heed we do not forfeit them all, by aſcribing too much to the ſecond cauſes, and too little to the firſt, by looking more to them for ſafety, than to him from whence it commeth. As I am confident, none of thoſe Worthies will arrogate it, but take up that of <hi>David, Non nobis Domine,</hi> Not unto us ô Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So let us alſo aſcribe the honour of all ultima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely and principally to God, <hi>for thine is the Kingdome, and the Power, and the Glory.</hi> Surely it is the Lord's doing, if our liberties be aſſerted, our Religion ſetled, our ſelves ſecured: Bleſſed and renowned for ever be the ſedulous Procurors, and the Royall ratifier of it: But let not our thankfulneſſe to them, make us forget God above. Gods they be called, but not <hi>Dii, imprimis glorificandi,</hi> Gods principally to be glorified, here is neither an injunction of adoration, nor of flattery.</p>
            <p>But a negative command it is, either becauſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives are more peremptory and generall, they bind <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> For it is never lawfull to do evill, in no place, by no perſon; or becauſe the firſt worke of Reformation muſt be by not doing evill; But as in the Decalogue or Morall Law affirmative precepts do include negative, and negative the affirmative, ſo here we may conceive this negative precept to comprehend alſo affirmative duties to Magiſtrates;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:156581:17"/>
and ſo ſhall conſider it both wayes, negatively and affirmatively. And firſt as it is a prohibition: <hi>(Thou ſhalt not raile, or revile, or curſe)</hi> ſo it includes three ſins to be avoyded.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is <hi>Contra reſiſtentiam in factis,</hi> it is againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in actions; for the Argument is good in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique, <hi>à minore ad majus,</hi> we muſt not revile, or curſe in words, therefore we muſt not reſiſt in actions.</p>
            <p>There is a threefold diſtinction of reſiſtance ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by ſome, One is <hi>Precepta negligendo,</hi> by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting commands; For this is a kind of reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>A ſecond <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> obſerves, <hi>Fraude</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving or miſ-informing Princes or Rulers, for ſuch abuſe is indeed no better than an unfriendly oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and may come in (rightly underſtood) under the title of reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>A third is, <hi>aperta vi,</hi> by open violence, &amp; this is ſurely prohibited incluſively by Gods Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile the Gods,</hi> as it is expreſly by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.12. Rebellion againſt authority, which God hath ſet over men is contrary to his precept, to the practice of all his Servants. If indeed ſuch earthly gods and rulers there ſhall be, who ſhall impoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious or diſhoneſt commands, contradictory to the Laws of God, it is then no breach of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:156581:18"/>
to diſobey him; for then they ceaſe to bee called Gods properly, they are rather Diabolicall; the Immortall God is rather to be obeyed than they, according to the determination of the Apoſtles, <q>
                  <hi>It is better to obey God than man,</hi> 
                  <bibl>Acts 4.19.</bibl>
               </q> Yet even then find we not reſiſtance countenanced againſt them in private men: Much difference and many reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions there are amongſt the Caſuiſts, how far the whole Civill State united in it ſelfe, may oppoſe the ſupreame Ruler; but all agree upon ſuch caſes only as can hardly be imagined, to fall out in Chriſtian Common-wealthes.</p>
            <p>If there be any ſuch reſiſtance tolerable it muſt be ſay they Firſt, where there is direct and abſolute Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny executed upon Lives and Conſciences.</p>
            <p>Secondly, where there is flat Idolatry introduced by force.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, where there is none other refuge left, but reſiſtance; neither flight nor ſuffering, and in theſe caſes (which God forbid ſhould ever go further than ſuppoſition) there are ſo many cautions added for moderation, and againſt revenge, that they who maintaine reſiſtance lawfull, yet might aſwell conclude it impoſſible to be meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, unfit to be executed. But as for us who are but private perſons, there is no difficulty but that we
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:156581:18"/>
may reſolve againſt all reſiſtance, without an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary perſcription. The <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> reſolution, becomes Chriſtians to their Rulers. <hi>Si duriora morte imperetis, potius moriemur,</hi> if yee command things har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than death we will rather dye: There is no allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wance of offence, or oppoſition againſt thoſe whom God hath ſet over us: the Primitive Chriſtians have no armes but <hi>preces &amp; lachrymae</hi> againſt their furious perſecuting Magiſtrates. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> uſeth no other force but of his ſtrongeſt Petitions, <hi>Rogamus Auguſte non pugnamus:</hi> Surely there is no reſiſting the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God: that is the firſt thing included in the prohibition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as it is a negative precept, ſo it forbids <hi>maledicentiam in verbis,</hi> railing or reviling in words, God hath not allowed man a liberty of reviling his neighbour, his equall; nor are mens tongues at their own command ſo abſolutely as to vent that which their malice or virulency ſhall dictate againſt any man: for did not the Law of man take cognizance of their ſlanders, yet if they ſhall give account of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry idle word, much more of every malignant and ſlanderous word againſt their brethren. The cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpeaker is a greater enemy to himſelfe, than thoſe he curſeth. But needs muſt it be more blameable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt publique Magiſtracy, then particular perſons;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:156581:19"/>
for there the Magiſtrates reſemblance to God, makes the injury reflect on him. He that ſpeaketh evill of Rulers, ſpeaketh not evill of man but God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called no leſſe than <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> plaſphemy in Scripture. Thoſe whom God hath ſet in Authority, he would not have ſubjected to the ſcurrilous tongues of railours, no more than he would have his own name blaſphemed: Saint <hi>Jude</hi> therefore makes thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (thoſe filthy dreamers as we tranſlate it) the worſt of men who ſpeake evill of dignities: <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> the Archangell (ſaith he) durſt not bring a rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling accuſation againſt the Devill. We never find the Saints of God, though never ſo highly provoked, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering bitter words againſt the higher powers, not <hi>Moſes</hi> againſt <hi>Pharoah,</hi> not the three Children againſt <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> when the Furnace is prepared, but <hi>O King live for ever.</hi> We heare not our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming againſt <hi>Herod,</hi> or <hi>Pilate</hi> condemning him; not <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>Feſtus</hi> in other tearmes when he ſaith he is mad, then in that mild reply, <hi>I am not mad moſt noble Feſtus:</hi> Once when he ſeemed to the ſtanders by to forget himſelfe, he recollecteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with this Text of mine, <q>
                  <hi>I wot not brethren that he was the high Prieſt,</hi> for it is written, <hi>thou ſhalt not ſpeak evill of the Ruler of thy people</hi> 
                  <bibl>Acts 23 4.</bibl>
               </q>  a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is amongſt Expoſitors, upon thoſe words
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:156581:19"/>
of <hi>Paul,</hi> which are partly quoted from my Text, and therefore I ſhall ſhortly indeavour to cleere them. He had called <hi>Ananias</hi> the High Prieſt whited wall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had commanded him to be ſmitten, and being rebuked by the ſtanders by for reviling Gods High Prieſt (for ſo they called <hi>Ananias</hi>) he anſwers, I knew not, brethren, that he was the High Prieſt, for it is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some ſay his meaning was, that he did not regard or conſider him as the High Prieſt: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that he did not account him worthy to bee the High Prieſt: others, that he plainly meant he did not know him to be the High Prieſt, for it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible he might miſtake: The chiefe Captaine ſitting there alſo in judicature, and the High Prieſt not in his Prieſtly habit, which ſhould diſtinguiſh him from others; ſo that <hi>Pauls</hi> anſwer to them conſiſts of two parts. Firſt, an acknowledgement of his ignorance, that he knew him not.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a deniall that he did raile at all, for he knew that there was a law againſt that: as if he ſhould ſay, I did not (I confeſſe brethren) know that he was ſo great a Magiſtrate as the High Prieſt, yet be he ſo, as I know him to be a Judge I did not raile upon him, though I ſharply reprehended his injuſtice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, for I know very well I ſhould not revile the Ruler of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:156581:20"/>Reprehenſions there may be of Rulers, but no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling, juſt charges or accuſations againſt them, but without rayling or curſing; All manner of rayling againſt them is here prohibited, be it in ſecret mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured amongſt friends, by ſtil detraction: or ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, be it openly before many, and that either by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them before others, or impudent reviling them to their own faces, as <hi>Shimeis</hi> was to <hi>David,</hi> all theſe are here forbidden, <hi>Thou ſhalt not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>How can we then but from hence taxe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne three ſorts of breakers of this Law?</p>
            <p>Firſt, even thoſe of the Miniſtry, who take too free a liberty of traducing, if not the higheſt Magiſtrate, yet at leaſt inferior rulers, both Eccleſiaſticall and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, in rude and homely language. It was never the leſſon their Maſter taught them to mixe their owne virulency with preaching the Goſpell. It is true the Miniſter of the Goſpell, who will be faithfull, muſt admoniſh the blamable Magiſtrate, hee muſt boldly exhort, rebuke, convince him; <hi>Elias</hi> may reprove <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> to his face, and <hi>John Baptist</hi> doth well to tell <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> plainly it is not lawfull for him to have his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wife; <hi>Nathan</hi> may come and tell <hi>David, Thou art the man;</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> boldly taxe the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius.</hi> But much caution there is neceſſary in ſuch reprehenſions of Princes and Rulers, they muſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:156581:20"/>
not be for ſuſpitions or jealouſies, or ſuppoſed faults or ſlighter error, but for enormous &amp; apparant ſins, for ſuch there were in all thoſe we inſtanced: Open Idolatry and oppreſſion in <hi>Ahab;</hi> Inceſt in <hi>Herod,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery and Murder in <hi>David;</hi> Injuſt tyranny in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting many Innocents in <hi>Theodoſius:</hi> The ſinnes of Rulers muſt be very evident, ere the pulpit taxe them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there muſt be diſtinction made betwixt the perſons &amp; their faults, the perſons of Magiſtrats muſt be ſpared <hi>(for they are called Gods)</hi> while their ſins are taxed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there muſt be diſcretion uſed, no bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or unmannerly termes, no railing or reviling.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it ſhould be <hi>coram</hi> too before them, as all thoſe reprehenſions were. Miniſteriall reprehenſions muſt not degenerate in <hi>tribunitios clamores,</hi> be turned into popular clamors; the people not be rated for the ſins of their Governors, and the Magiſtrates faults be aggravated before thoſe who are not to redreſſe them To exceed theſe limits, is an unhappy breach of this Law, with which our Churches have lately rung too loud, ſo that we had need have it the Mottoe of our Pulpits, <hi>Thou ſhalt not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this muſt alſo condemne the ſcurrilous generation of Libellers, who taking advantage of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:156581:21"/>
freedome of our times (of which we ſhould make better uſe) have vented their railing invective Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets againſt many ſorts of Magiſtrates; were the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations never ſo juſt, the crimes never ſo odious, yet could not theſe men be juſtified in their bitternes; which exceeds the bounds of Chriſtianity, of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon humanity it ſelfe; the Devill that great accuſer durſt not have brought ſuch railing accuſations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Michael.</hi> Theſe muſt needs ſtand guilty of the breach of this injunction.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It muſt alſo reprehend thoſe who in their Common diſcourſes make themſelvs too eager Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers of the actions of the Higher Powers; tongues are not left at liberty to accuſe and Cenſure as they pleaſe, the proceedings of the Superiors.</p>
            <p>It was indeed a noble and generous ſpeech of that <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour <hi>Auguſt. In libera Civitate liberas lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guas eſſe oportere,</hi> That in a free State tongues ſhould be at liberty, and a happineſſe truely accounted by the Hiſtorian of his Times; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi ſentire quicquid velis, &amp; quicquid ſentis dicere licet;</hi> When men may think wLat they pleaſe, and ſpeake what they think: nor can we but admire the lenity of thoſe Chriſtian Emperors, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Arcadius,</hi> who would have no man puniſhed for ſpeaking evill of them, for <hi>Si ex levitate profectum, eſt contemnendum; Si ex inſania,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:156581:21"/>
miſeratione digniſsimum; ſi ab injuria, remittendum:</hi> if it proceed from lightneſſe, or vanity, it is to be deſpiſed; if from madneſſe, it is to be pittyed; if from malice, to be forgiven: But notwithſtanding ſuch indulgence (whereof our times have had a ſhare) Chriſtians muſt know not to abuſe their liberty: if they ſtretch it to traduce and cenſure thoſe who are ſet over them, they uſe it for a cloake of maliciouſneſſe, and breake that peremptory Law, which expreſſely ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There is yet more in this Precept: for as it forbids reſiſtance in act and railing in words; ſo thirdly, <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crationes in men<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> curſing in the thought of thoſe who are called Gods; malignant conceits of their actions in our breaſts muſt not be entertained, nor evill wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes imagined and contrived againſt them; for even the ſoule muſt be ſubject to powers that are ordained of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. They are little beholding to him for reſtraining his tongue, who harbours and frames curſes in his heart: It is the adviſe of the wiſeſt of men, <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.20.</bibl> 
                  <hi>Curſe not the King, no not in thy thought: and curſe not the rich in thy bedchamber, for a bird of the aire ſhall carry the voyce, and that which hath wings ſhall tell the matter:</hi>
               </q> that is, thy guilty thoughts may betray thee before thou art aware: for Kings and Magiſtrates have quicke eyes and eares; or at the leaſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:156581:22"/>
thou maiſt be ſure thy thoughts are knowne to him to whom thou muſt give account of them, and he can never approve them, when there is curſing of his Ordinance.</p>
            <p>For us therefore (Beloved) let not our impatience or miſ-underſtanding drive us to ſuch intemperance: let us not harbour any curſing or malignant thought, either againſt him whom God hath made our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soveraigne, or thoſe who under him, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be the inſtruments of our eſtabliſhment. The meeke and patient Spirit, muſt looke upon the actions of both, as them whom God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for his good, and in ſtead of theſe requitalls, which are flately forbidden in my Text, railing and curſing (which neither become our mouthes, nor hearts) let us frame our ſelves to the contrary affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive duties, which are here virtually included, But I muſt but name them.</p>
            <p>In oppoſition then to reviling and curſing, there muſt be uſed towards them who are called Gods. Firſt, Subjection, we muſt heartily ſubmit our ſelves to them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. Secondly, honor and reverence, we muſt honor the King, and conſequently all who derive power from him. Thirdly, fidelity, as <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tai</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <bibl>2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.21.</bibl> 
                  <hi>Whereſoever my Lord the King ſhall be, whether in life or death; even there will thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant be:</hi>
               </q> and while we are faithfull to him, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:156581:22"/>
wee muſt not bee unfaithfull to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, as our owne late proteſtation will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber us. Fourthly, We owe them obedience, for this is due to the Commands &amp; Laws of Kings &amp; Rulers, while they are conſonant to thoſe of God. Fiftly, Let us allow them paying of tribute, for this both our Saviour, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels us is due to Kings, and Rulers, and never let that be denied, which muſt purchaſe publique ſecurity. Laſtly, in ſtead of this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden curſing, let us allow them prayer; for if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyne ſupplication for Kings, and all that are in authority in generall; much more doth it oblige us to pray for a gracious King, for the authority we have moſt deſired and prayed for; and this duty is the moſt neceſſary, and higheſt we can allow them. May we therefore never ceaſe to pray, that God would unite the hearts more and more, of our King and Parliament: That he will direct and aſſiſt them with his Spirit of wiſdome. That he will proſper them in their deſignes, againſt enemies abroad, in their Reformations at home. That he will protect them againſt all oppoſitions forraine, or domeſtique. That he will give us a bleſſing upon all their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. Theſe things we moſt humbly beſeech thee (oh moſt gracious Father) to grant unto us, and that for the merits of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
