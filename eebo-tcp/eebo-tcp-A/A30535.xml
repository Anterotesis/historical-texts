            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FOrasmuch as it hath come to passe in the World for many Ages since the last glorious appearance of Christ Jesus, and the light of his glorious Gospel, through his Servants the holy Apostles, That <hi>Antichrist,</hi> that man of sin, the enemy of Christ and his Kingdom, hath ruled in the hearts of people, and throughout &amp; over the <hi>Christian</hi> World, and he hath been exalted within and without, ever since the falling away from the true faith, which once was delivered to the Apostles and true Churches, and he hath shewed himselfe to be God, and hath sitten in the <hi>seat of God,</hi> and hath exercised Lordship over the persons and consciences of men, throughout

generations, ever since the falling away from the faith; for the true Church, the elected Spouse, the Lambs Wife, which once brought forth him that was to Rule the Nations, and was clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the Sun, and had once great beauty and excellency, hath been fled into the <hi>Wildernesse,</hi> and hath been desolate as without Husband and Issue; but hath remained in her place, prepared her of God, where she hath dwelt in mourning, and been fed with the bread of sorrow, being pursued thither by the <hi>dragon</hi> and his floods of <hi>cruelty,</hi> who also waited to devour the man childe when he was born, and the <hi>Martyrs</hi> blood hath been shed, and the holy <hi>Prophets, and Apostles and Saints,</hi> have been made war against, and killed &amp; persecuted for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse sake, and the <hi>two witnesses</hi> have long laid slain and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced over in the streets of the great City, and the blood of the Innocent hath been drunk, and the <hi>Lamb</hi> and <hi>his followers</hi> hath been made war against, and <hi>the dragon, the devil and Satan</hi> hath deceived the World, into the name of Christians, without true Christian life, and Righteousnesse and Truth hath stood afar off, and Justice and Mercy hath been wanting, and the fear of the Lord and true obedience to him hath been in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure expelled out of Nations, and even all that would not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the <hi>Beast</hi> and his Images, and receive his <hi>mark,</hi> the Beast hath had Power <hi>to kill them,</hi> and he hath had power to execute his wrath against them that have followed the <hi>Lamb,</hi> even all this time of darknesse and Apostacy which hath over-shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Christian World,</hi> since the Apostles dayes until this time; And all this hath been since the falling away from the Life and Righteousnesse and Spirit of Jesus, as I have said, and the <hi>Beast</hi> hath been great that arose <hi>out of the Sea, and out of the Earth,</hi> (when the true faith was lost) and his power mighty amongst men, for he received power from the <hi>dragon,</hi> that <hi>made war</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the true Church, and sought to devour <hi>the man childe,</hi> and power hath been given him over <hi>Kindreds Tongues and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and all the World hath wondered and followed after the <hi>Beast,</hi> and have been admiring his power and his great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

and saying, Who is able to make war with him, for hee hath had a mouth given that hath spoken great things, and it hath been given him to war with the Saints, and to overcome them by his unrighteous <hi>Laws and decrees,</hi> and all that dwelt upon the earth <hi>hath worshipped</hi> him, whose names are not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of Life, and he hath had many <hi>heads,</hi> (even di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers sorts and changes of government) and many <hi>horns,</hi> with which he hath pushed the Innocent, and ruled over the earth, and kept all under his power, and he hath set up Images to worship and likenesses without life, and he hath caused both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive his <hi>mark,</hi> and he hath carried <hi>the Whore,</hi> and she hath journeyed upon him from Nation to Nation through the earth, in the sheeps clothing, and made all Nations drink her cup of <hi>fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and the <hi>whore,</hi> that false Church, she hath sate as <hi>a Queen,</hi> in great state and authority upon Nations, Tongues, Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and Peoples, and through <hi>the Beasts authority,</hi> which hath carried her, she hath Ruled in great authority over <hi>the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, persons and estates</hi> of people, and she hath drunk the Saints blood, and the Martyrs blood, and in her is found even until this day the blood of <hi>the Martyrs and the Prophets, and of just men,</hi> and of all that hath been slain upon the earth, and she hath exercised <hi>cruelty and tyranny</hi> over the heritage of God, and she hath had the sheeps clothing upon her, even part of the garment of the <hi>Lambs Wife,</hi> and she hath appeared in much beauty with a <hi>golden cup</hi> in her hand, in which the wine of her fornications, and the filthinesse thereof hath appeared, and which she hath caused the Nations to drink, and by <hi>her sorceries and witchcrafts</hi> she hath deceived the World, and with her false <hi>miracles, and shews and Images and false ministers</hi> which she hath set up, she hath corrupted the earth, and all this she hath done by the <hi>Beasts power,</hi> that hath carried her, who received his authority from the <hi>dragon,</hi> and from the devil; and thus <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, the Beast and the Whore</hi> have ruled in the World in great authority for many generations, and the World hath been as a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40828:3"/>
wildernesse by them, and waste, and barren of all good fruit, truth and faith hath been departed from amongst men, and love and peace hath been far away, and murders, thefts, wars, strifes and all injustice and wickednesse hath abounded in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and thus the whole earth hath been corrupted through the <hi>Whore and false Church,</hi> who hath deceived <hi>Kings and Rulers and Peoples</hi> by her <hi>inchantments and sorceries,</hi> which she hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them to receive at her hand, and out of her golden cup of abominations, out of which they have drunk <hi>false doctrines and practises</hi> to the deceiving of their soules and bodies; But now the day of the Lord is come and coming, and the Lambs Kingdom is to be set up, and the Kingdoms of this world must be changed and recovered again, and will become the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Lord,</hi> and of his Christ, and the marriage of the <hi>Lamb</hi> is come again, and the day of glad tydings unto the poor and to the distressed, and the <hi>Lambs wife,</hi> shal be adorned for her husband, she shall be cloathed with the Sun, and shall be covered with her former beauty, and shall be led out of the Wilderness, and the earth shall be refreshed and delivered from the <hi>oppressions and Tyrannies of Antichrist and the Whore,</hi> for the hour of her judgements are come, and the darknesse of the night of woful <hi>Apostacy</hi> which hath clouded the World is passing over, and the light of the Lamb is risen, and the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>star hath appeared in the hearts of people, and the <hi>man of sin</hi> which hath sate in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and shewed himself to be God, and falsly exercised the bodies and consciences of deceived people <hi>in false wayes and worships,</hi> is discovering and destroying by the spirit of his mouth, and by the brightnesse of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jesus, and the <hi>Beast and the false Prophet</hi> shall be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live and cast into the lake of fire, and the Beast and false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet shall be tormented day and night for ever, for the breath of life from God is entered into the two witnesses, and they shall again prophesie, and the light of the glorious Gospel that hath long been hid, must again be preached to <hi>Kindreds Tongues and Nations,</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>Christ Jesus</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40828:3"/>
must be set up, and these things is the Lord God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bringing to passe, and he will confound and destroy Antichrist and all that have worshiped him, and they that have worshiped the <hi>Beast, and drunken the cup of fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and committed idolatry with the great Whore, they shall be taken and cast into the bed of torment, and shall weep and howl, because of the great destruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> that great City who hath been the glory of Kingdoms, and made rich her <hi>Merchants</hi> (the false Ministers) with deceivablenes, whom God will overthrow; that great fenced City of confusion (the false Church) that great Whore, the <hi>Mother of all abominations,</hi> the Lord God is risen against her, to enquire for the blood of <hi>Martyres, and Prophets, and righteous men,</hi> that is found in her, and she shall be rewarded according to her wayes, and as she hath given others to drink the cup of fornication, so in like manner shal she drink the cup of fierceindignation of the Lords wrath <hi>from his Saints,</hi> and she shall no more deceive the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by her sorceries, but the earth shall be delivered from her, and the Kingdom of the Son of God shall be exalted over all, and the light of the Lamb shall be the Light of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all that are saved shall walk in the light of it, and truth shall reign, and the fruit of righteousnesse shall abound, and all people shall glorifie God their Maker, and the whole earth shall be refreshed with the mercy of him that made her.</p>
            <p>Wherefore all ye <hi>Kings, Princes, Parliaments, Rulers</hi> through whole <hi>Christendom,</hi> this is a request unto you all of a lover of Immortal soules, that you will cease to commit <hi>fornication with the great Whore,</hi> &amp; that you wil not any longer drink her cup of <hi>Idolatries,</hi> neither that you wil causeNations to drink it, neither that you will carry the <hi>great Whore any more,</hi> nor receive her sorceries and inchantments to deceive your soules and bodies, and this the Lord God Almighty (who ought to be the fear &amp; dread of all Nations) requireth of you, and it is a charge to you in the presence of the Lord God, that ye do not any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger defend the great City Babylon, and the false Church with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40828:4"/>
your weapons of <hi>cruelty and oppression,</hi> neither that you will ever any more oppresse the persons and consciences of people on her part and on her defence, but that you will wholly cast off the Whore, and not suffer her to sit upon you, and that you will not be Servants to her, to execute her cruelties up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bodies and consciences of people; for these things have you done, and therefore is the Lord displeased with you, and therefore deliver your selves from the abominations of the folse Church, and receive not her delusions, neither <hi>impose them upon the peoples under you,</hi> for now the judgements of the great <hi>Whore</hi> is come, and the time that the Lord will reward her according to her wayes, and she shall have of the fruit of her doings, and if you will yet uphold her, and commit <hi>fornication with her,</hi> and compel the Nations to drink of <hi>her cup,</hi> and cause all people to worship the <hi>Beast,</hi> and to receive his <hi>mark</hi> as it hath been, Then the Lord shall execute his vengeance upon you, and you shall in no wise be deiivered; Wherefore I say again unto you, arise out of darknesse, and come to the brightnesse of the light of the morning, even to the Sons appearance, and receive his Kingdom, and lay down your Crowns at his feet, for the <hi>Lamb</hi> is risen whose Crown is immortal, and ye and all your glory, and greatness, and honor, and power is but as dust &amp; ashes before him, and he can break you down &amp; never build you up again; and come out of great <hi>Babylon,</hi> and forsake your city, for the day of the Lord will sudenly come upon you, for great <hi>Babylon</hi> is come into remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance before the Lord to reward her with great indignation; Wherefore this is a call unto you, lay aside your <hi>Inquisitions, your Goales and Houses of Correction, and Prisons, and all your tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing, and persecuting of the Persons and Consciences of People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Worship, Church and Ministry,</hi> for in these things and by these weapons you have defended the Whore, and through the force of your violent Laws, and cruel <hi>impositions</hi> unjustly laid upon people, have the Whore (the false Church) been <hi>carried</hi> by you, and <hi>defended</hi> by you; but lay aside all your

cruel weapons, and not persecute nor kill, nor shed the blood of the Servants of the Lord, by unjust Laws, nor limit not the Spirit of God from crying against <hi>Babylon,</hi> and reproving her iniquities, for these things have you done in defence of the Whore, for you have been the carriers of her, the defenders and preserves of her by your unrighteous Laws, and through you hath she sat as a <hi>Queen,</hi> thinking she should nere see <hi>sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> because ye have defended her, and taken part with her, and caused Nations to drink her cup, for you have been the exec<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
