            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For, touching the firſt, it is very manifeſt, that as the branch cannot bring forth frute, except it be, and abide in the vine,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.</note> no more can any perſon liuing pleaſe God, except hee be and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in Chriſt, and ſo become his obedient and faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, as himſelf witneſſeth: wherby all Infidels are abandoned
<pb facs="tcp:4619:18"/>
with their almes, becauſe they are not the members of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond circumſtance to be conſidered, Is, that we giue our almes ſimply for Chriſtes ſake onely,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.</note> to helpe and relieue his néedie members (without any other ſiniſter reſpect) for ſo hath he commaunded, (as before is ſhewed) neither may we do otherwiſe, if we conſider the goods we haue are his, to vſe to his glory,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.</note> and that we muſt one day make account of them.</p>
            <p>The third circumſtance, Is, that we be in charitie with all maner perſons, when we giue our almes. For, (as the Apoſtle truly affirmeth) if we ſhould giue away all that we haue to the vſe of the poore,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note> and our bodies beſides to be burned to aſhes, yet ſhould all be loſt, (except we both liue and die in charitie) for God is charitie,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.16</note> and he that liueth in charitie, dwelleth in God, and none but ſuch perſons.</p>
            <p>The fourth circumſtance, is, That we giue our almes frée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in compaſſion, (without all vainglory) for, although the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes were liberall in almes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.3.14.</note> yet becauſe they did all to be ſéene of men, and recommended by them, they loſt their reward at the hands of God. Therefore Chriſt teacheth all his Diſciples, (ſo much as is poſſible) not to let their left hand know in theſe caſes, what the right hand doth: ſo will God one day reueale it to their comfort.</p>
            <p>The fift circumſtance, is, That when we giue our almes, we may not vſe to boaſt thereof afterwards,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.</note> as the proud Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie did, that he had giuen ſo much, and others ſo little, leaſt we looſe our labour as he did, (who was reiected (not for his almes) but for his vnlawfull bragging of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The ſixt circumſtance, is, To take héed in any caſe that we do not ſéeke to merit by our almes, leaſt we exclude our ſelues from Gods mercy, whereby alone the elect are redéemed in Chriſt Ieſus.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob.</hi> 3.</note> But when we haue done the beſt that we can, humbly to confeſſe (as he hath taught vs,) That we are all <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſeruants</hi>) ſo farre ſhould we be,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.10</note> from ſéeking at all to merite thereby.</p>
            <p>If the Papiſts and others would thinke of theſe points, that
<pb facs="tcp:4619:18"/>
make ſo much vaunting of their almes giuing, they ſhould be ſoone rid of two bad opinions, both touching the maner and end of their almes. For, (as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2</note>) If the perfect law of God could not bring vs life, (becauſe we wanted power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it) ſhall we once imagine to merit an higher place in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, by our imperfit good workes, (the beſt wherof are polluted with ſin, as before is ſhewed): it is impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Neither let the Papiſts vntruly reproach vs, that we deny good workes, or déedes of charitie, for (as they may perceiue by that which hath bin ſaid) we vrge them to all Chriſtians, vpon paine of damnation to thoſe that refuſe them, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without them approue themſelues to be true beléeuers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iam.</hi> 2. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.</note> and without faith no man can pleaſe God, yet we do not put them in Chriſts place, as the cauſe or matter of our ſaluation, but as effects only procéeding from faith, whereby we make it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that we do belong vnto his redemption,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.7.4</note> becauſe we deſire in all things to pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>Now are we come by courſe to conſider of that aſſured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which he ſhall reape, that is, <hi>rich in good workes, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of almes,</hi> which is ſet downe in this ſentence following, <hi>The Lord will deliuer him in the time of his trouble.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee are to note (as before is remembred) theſe two ſpeciall points.</p>
