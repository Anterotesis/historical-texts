            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>I've not one smutty Iest in all my part.</l>
               <l>Here's not one Scene of tickling Rallery;</l>
               <l>There we quite lose the Pit and Gallery,</l>
               <l>His <hi>London Cuckolds</hi> did afford you sport.</l>
               <l>That pleas'd the Town, and did divert the Court.</l>
               <l>But 'cause some squeamish Females of renown</l>
               <l>Made visits with design to cry it down,</l>
               <l>He swore in's Rage he would their humors fit,</l>
               <l>And write the next without one word of Wit.</l>
               <l>No Line in this will tempt your minds to Evil,</l>
               <l>It's true, 'tis dull, but then 'tis very civil.</l>
               <l>No double sense shall now your thoughts beguile,</l>
               <l>Make Lady Blush, nor Ogling Gallant Smile.</l>
               <l>But mark the Fate of this mis-judging Fool!</l>
               <l>A Bawdy Play was never counted Dull,</l>
               <l>Nor modest Comedy e're pleas'd you much,</l>

               <l>Come often to't that he at length may see</l>
               <l>'Tis more than a pretended Modesty</l>
               <l>Stick by him now, for if he finds you falter,</l>
               <l>He quickly will his way of writing alter;</l>
               <l>And every Play shall send you blushing home,</l>
               <l>For, tho you rail, yet then we're sure you'll come,</l>
               <l>Thus Brides are Coy and Bashful the first night,</l>
               <l>But us'd to't once, are mad for their delight.</l>

                  <p>Ah Dame <hi>Dobson,</hi> I am almost out of breath, I slipt out at our back door, and came running to acquaint you, that the Countess is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly coming to you.</p>

                  <p>Let her come, I am prepar'd what to say, being such a Credulous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as I know she is; let her Marry him after that if she dare.</p>

                  <speaker>Hel.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, but you don't know that the Collonel whom she'd be well enough pleas'd with for a Husband, comes along with her in disguise of her Footman, whom she has promis'd to make happy, if he can any wayes convince her, that what you do is all but a Cheat; and he has disguis'd himself to try if you or any of your Devils are Cunning enough to discover him; therefore be upon your guard.</p>

                  <p>I am glad to hear this, for it saves me a great deal of trouble, and in the hurry of business I might not have taken the pains to have found it out. But does not the Countess think you suspect our Correspondence?</p>

                  <p>How shou'd she? I am always speaking against you to her; I say daily to her, that 'tis by meer chance if you tell any thing true, and to convince me of my error, she runs o're all the particular remarkable things of her life, which she pretends you have given her an account of; but little thinks she all this while that 'tis from me you know 'em.</p>

                     <hi>Hellen</hi>'s a Fool, and has no reason to say so; for after those Truths this Woman has told me, so often I ought to Credit her; Do not therefore persist in perswading me to render my self unhappy by Marriage that wou'd prove so disastrous.</p>

                  <p>Nay, I am sensible I am not a perfect Beauty, but my comfort is, that as I am not absolutely handsom, I am not very ugly; I know I have something in me taking enough, a lively air, not altogether ungentile, indifferently well shap'd, no ill meen, and some share of wit too; and with all this, I can make no very ill figure in the World.</p>

                  <p>I do not come to you to be made more Beautiful than I am, but to have something that may preserve what is already agreeable in me, and to keep me a great while in my prime.</p>

                  <speaker>Dame.</speaker>
                  <p>The only inconvenience is, that you must keep your Chamber fifteen days, and not be seen, you'll not be the only person, I have four or five Patients at this time that keep within for this very reason.</p>

                  <p>And will not this <hi>Pomatum</hi> lessen the Mouth, and take it off a little at the corners? for methinks a little Mouth is the becoming'st thing, the Mouth can never be too little, too little.</p>

                  <p>I have a contracting Water that does that. But my <hi>Pomatum</hi> will make the under Lip a little more pouting and ruddy, Oval the Eyes, and give a just proportion to the Nose.</p>

                  <p>I am experienc'd, and know Women: There is a sort of 'em that are proud, haughty, and imperious, who think it a scorn that any man in the World shou'd say he has had the advantage of 'em. There are others of a cold Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution by Nature, and insensible: Some that nothing can change, when once they have plac'd their Affections. And as this sort are very pleasant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to a man, whil'st his appetite serves; so are they a most troublesome sort of Cattle, when a Lover begins to retreat: They are Killing, Stabbing, and Poisoning: Others there are that have a natural Aversion both to Love and to Mankind.</p>

                  <p>There is a great difference indeed: But now as to your Business! I won't say 'tis above my Power; but as I cannot absolutely effect it without the utmost severity of Art, and the most rigorous of my Conjurations, to assemble the Spirits that are most stubborn and difficult to obey; so it cannot be done in a day; and you will not in less than six Months perceive that I have compass'd for you what you desire.</p>

And that it wou'd be enough to hear it fall! That done, I had the string ready which I had prepar'd with a running knot, and as I came to Bed in the dark from the Chimney, where I put out the light, I stept and put it o're the Neck of the Jarr; and unwound the bottom all along, as I crept to the Bed side.‚ÄîI was no sooner lay'd, but my Lady crept close to me, and clasp'd her Arm

               <l>THo I am no great Conjurer you see,</l>
               <l>Nor deal in Devil or Astrology,</l>

               <l>The Poet stole the <hi>French Divineress.</hi>

               <l>But let not that, pray, put you in a passion,</l>

                  <hi>Kidnapping</hi> has of late been much in fashion:</l>
               <l>If Alderman did <hi>Spirit</hi> men away,</l>
               <l>Why may not Poets then Kidnap a Play?</l>
               <l>Poets are Planters, Stage is their Plantation;</l>
