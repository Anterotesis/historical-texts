         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>There is something considerable in the last words of

though no affliction for the present seemeth joyous,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1 6, 7, 8,</note>
but is grievous: yet it may yield the peaceable fruit
of righteousness to them who are exercised thereby,
wherein we rejoyce, though now for a season we are

that of gold, might be found unto our praise, and
honour, and glory at the appearing of Christ, whom
we have not seen, yet love him, in whom now, though
we see him not, yet do we believe and rejoyce with
joy unspeakable and full of glory.</p>

               <item>1. The reality of this perplexity.</item>
               <item>2. The greatness of it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. For the reality of it: after <hi>David</hi> had sinned
in numbring the people, God sends the Prophet <hi>Gad</hi>
to him, and puts three things to his choice, as you may
read in <hi>ver.</hi> 12. God was determined to make <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
smart for numbring the people, but leaves it to
<hi>Davids</hi> liberty, whether he would have seven years
famine, or three months to flee before his enemies, or
three dayes pestilence: this was a posing Question,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54726:5"/>
and <hi>David</hi> had cause to be in a great strait; for
these objects are not amiable in their own nature,
they are objects to be avoided and declined; in the
first view of them they seem to be equally misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
therefore <hi>David</hi> had cause to say he was in a
strait.</p>
            <p>This perplexity was not only real, but exceeding
great: <hi>I am in a great strait:</hi> and there are two
things made this so great.</p>
            <p>1. The greatness of the punishments proposed,
Famine, Sword, and Plague: these are the three
besomes with which God sweeps mankind from off
the earth: these are Gods three iron whips, by which
he chastiseth sinful man: these are the three arrows
shot out of the quiver of Gods wrath, for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of man, they are, as one calleth them, <hi>Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surae
humani generis.</hi> In <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. you shall read
of four Horses, when the four first Seals were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
a white horse, a red horse, a black horse, and a
pale horse: after Christ had ridden on the white
horse propagating the Gospel, then follows the red
horse, a type of War, then the black Horse, an Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphick
of Famine; then the pale horse, the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
of Pestilence. Now God was resolved to ride
on one of these horses, and <hi>David</hi> must choose upon
which God should ride; this was a great strait: Let
me present <hi>Davids</hi> lifting up his eyes to Heaven, and
speaking to God thus: O my God, what is this mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
thou hast sent me? Thou offerest me three
things: I am in a strait, I know which to refuse, but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54726:6"/>
which to choose I know not: shall the Land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> a Land flowing with milk and honey, shall
this Land endure seven years famine, and be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into a wilderness, and dispeopled? and shall I,
whose hands thou hast taught to fight, and whose
fingers to war, shall I that have subdued all my
enemies, shall I in my old age, and all my Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
fly three moneths before our enemies and
be driven to Caves and Rocks to hide ourselves?
O thou my God, who art my refuge, shall I and
my people be a prey to the pestilence that walketh
in darkness and destruction, that walketh at noon
day? O my God, I know not what to do, <hi>I am in
a great strait.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The second reason why this strait was so great,
was because of the guilt of sin that lay on <hi>Davids</hi>
spirit: for <hi>David</hi> knew that this severe message was
the fruit of the sin he committed in numbring the
people: but you will say, why was it a sin in <hi>David</hi>
to number the people? <hi>Moses</hi> had often numbred
the people, three times, and it was not counted sin;
<hi>Iosephus</hi> answereth, the sin of <hi>David</hi> was, because he
did not require the halfe Shackle he was to have had
from all were numbred <hi>Exod.</hi> 30. 12. 13.</p>
            <p>Others said, he sinned in numbring all ages,
whereas he was to number but from 20 years; but
these are but conjectural reasons: I conceive the sin of
<hi>David</hi> was because he did it without a lawful call,
and for an unlawful end, <hi>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e causa Legitima:</hi> he
sinned in the manner rather then in the matter; for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54726:6"/>
there was no cause for him to number the people but
curiosity, and no end but vain glory: <hi>go through all the
tribes of</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>srael <hi>and number the people, that I may know
the number of my people,</hi> ver 2. <hi>Davids</hi> heart was lifted
up with pride, and creature-confidence; he begins
to boast of the multitude of his people, and to trust
in an arm of flesh; therefore God sends the Prophet
to <hi>David</hi> to prick the bladder of his pride: as if God
should say, <hi>I will teach you to number the people, by
lessening the number of your people.</hi> Now the burden
of his sin did add much to the burthen of his heavy
message; <hi>ver. 13. After David had numbred the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
his heart smote him:</hi> the message smites him,
and his heart smites him, <hi>and he said, I have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
greatly in that which I have done: now I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee take away the iniquity of thy servant,
for I have done very foolishly.</hi> If <hi>David</hi> had been
to suffer this great punishment out of love to God,
or for a good conscience, he would not have been
so distressed: There are two sorts of straits in
Scripture: some suffered for God and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
and there are straits suffered for sin.</p>
            <p>1. There are straits suffered for God and a good
conscience. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 36, 37. those Martyrs there
were driven to great straits: but these were straits
for God and a good Conscience, and these straits
were the Saints greatest enlargements, they were
so sweetned to them by the consolations, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations
of Gods Spirit; a prison was a paradise
to them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. they look joyfully at the
spoiling of their goods. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 41. they departed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54726:7"/>
from the presence of the Council, rejoycing that
they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his
name. Straits for a good conscience are greatest
enlargements; therefore <hi>Paul</hi> gloryeth in this strait,
<hi>Paul a prisoner,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. There are straits suffered for sin, and these
are envenomed by the guilt of sin: sin puts poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
into all our distresses and perplexitys Now
such was the strait into which <hi>David</hi> was now dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
it was a strait caused by sin, and that made it
so unwelcome and uncomfortable: so that from
hence I gather this Observation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> That sin and iniquity brings persons and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
into marvelous labyrinths and perplexitys: into
true real and great molestations: a man free from
sin, is free in the midst of straits: a man guilty
of sin, is in a strait in the midst of freedom.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Adam</hi> had sinned in eating of the forbidden
fruit, the whole world was a prison to him: Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
it selfe was an Hell to him, he knew not where
to hide himselfe from the presence of God. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that <hi>Cain</hi> had murthered his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> he
was brought into such a strait, that he was afraid
that every one that met him would slay him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lass
poor <hi>Cain,</hi> how many was there then in the
world? we read but his father and mother, yet
such was his distress, that he cryeth out, every one
that met him would slay him, <hi>Gen</hi> 4. 14. Into
what a strait did sin bring the old world? the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54726:7"/>
of sin brought a deluge of water to drown
them. Into what a strait did sin bring <hi>Sodom</hi> and
<hi>Gomorrah?</hi> the fire of lust raining in <hi>Sodom</hi> and
<hi>Gomorrah,</hi> brought down fire from Heaven to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them. Sin brings external, internal, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
straits upon persons and nations.</p>
            <p>1. Sin brings external straits; sin brings Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine:
Sword, and Plague; Sin brings Agues and
Feavours, Gout and Stone, and all manner of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases:
yea, sin brings death it selfe, which is the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of sin. Read <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. and you
will see a black roul of courses, which were the fruit
of sin. Sin brought <hi>Sion</hi> into <hi>Babylon;</hi> and when
the Jews had murthered Christ, forty years after
they were brought into that distress, when the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was besieged by <hi>Titus Vespatian,</hi> that they did
eat one another, the Mother did eat her child;
that whereas <hi>David</hi> had a choice which of the
three he would have, either Famine, Plague, or
Sword: the poor Jews had all three concatena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
together in the siedge: sin brings all manner
of external plagues.</p>
            <p>2. Sin brought persons and Nations into inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aits: sin brings soul-plagues, which are
worse then bodily plagues: sin brings hardness
of heart, blindness of mind, a spirit of slumber, a
reprobate sence; sin brings a spiritual famine
upon a Land; it brings a famine of the word,
<hi>Amos</hi> 8. 11. sin causes God to take away the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
from a people: sin brings internal plagues:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54726:8"/>
sin wakens conscience, and fills it full of perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
Into what a strait did sin drive <hi>Judas,</hi> after
he had betrayed Christ? Into what a strait did sin
drive <hi>Spira?</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> gloried in his tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for God: but when he speaks of his sin, he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out, <hi>O miserable man that I am, who shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
me from this body of death? David</hi> a valiant
man when he speaks of sin, saith, they are too heavy
a burden for him to bear: <hi>A wounded conscience who
can bear!</hi> saith the Wise-man.</p>
            <p>3. Sin bringeth eternal straits: O the strait
that a wicked man shall be brought into at the
great and dreadful day of judgement, when all the
world shall be on fire about him; when he shall
call to the mountains to hide him, and to the rocks
to cover him from the wrath of God: then will
he cry out with <hi>David, I am O Lord, in a great strait.</hi>
And when the wicked shall be condemned to Hell,
who can express the straits they then shall be in?
<hi>Bind them hand and foot, and cast them into everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
darkness, Matth.</hi> 25. When a wicked man shall be
bound with everlasting chains of darkness, then
he will cry out, <hi>I am in a great strait.</hi> Consider
what <hi>Dives</hi> saith to <hi>Abraham:</hi> he desires that <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi>
might but dip the tip of his finger in water,
and that he might cool his toung: not his whole
body, but his toung: but that would not be
granted.</p>
            <p>It is impossible the toung of man should set out
the great straits the damned suffer in Hell, both in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54726:8"/>
regard of the greatnesse and everlastingnesse of
them.</p>
            <p>This is all I shall say for Explication.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 1. I chiefly aim at the Application: Doth
sin bring Nations and Persons into external, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and eternal straits? then this sadly reproves
those that choose to commit sin to avoid perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
There are thousands in <hi>England</hi> guilty of this,
that to avoid poverty, will lye, cheat and cozen,
and to gain an estate will sell God and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
and to avoid the losse of estate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
will do any thing: they will be sure to
be of that Religion which is uppermost: be it what
it will. Now give me leave this morning to speak
three things to these sort of men: and O that my
words might prevail with them!</p>
            <p>1. Consider it is sin only that makes trouble to
deserve the name of trouble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for when we suffer
for Gods sake, or a good Conscience, these trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
are so sweetned by the consolations of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
that they are no troubles at all: therefore in
Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes the Martyrs wrote to their
friends out of prison, <hi>If you knew the Comforts we
have in prison, you would wish to be with us: I am
in prison before I am in prison,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:54726:9"/>
Famous is the story of the three Children: they
were in a great strait when cast into the fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace;
Binde them hand and foot, and cast them
into the Furnace: but when they were there they
were unbound, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 25. saith <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,
Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the
fire? and lo I see foure men loose walking in the midst
of the fire, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of
God.</hi> I have often told you, when three are cast
into the fire for a good Conscience, God will make
the fourth: therefore, I say, straits and sufferings
for God are not worth the name of straits. <hi>David</hi>
was often driven into straits, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6. he was
sore distressed when his Town was burnt, and his
Wives and Children taken captive by the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites:</hi>
I, but that was a distress of danger, not of
sin: therefore he encourageth himself in the Lord
his God. <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> was in a great strait, <hi>2 Chron.
20. 12. We know not what to do,</hi> saith he: this was
a strait of danger, not caused by his sin, and God
quickly delivered him: but the strait that <hi>David</hi>
was in, was caused by his sin, and that made it so
bitter. I am loth to inlarge here: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was
in a great strait, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 23. but this was a blessed
strait, an Evangelical strait, saith Saint <hi>Chrysostom,
He knew not whether to die for his own sake, or to live
for the Churches sake, were best;</hi> he was willing to
adjourn his going to Heaven for the good of the
people of God: Nay, christ was in a strait, <hi>Luke</hi>
12. 15, I have a Baptism to be baptized withal,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54726:9"/>
and how am I straitned till it be accomplished?
I am to shed my blood for my Elect: that is the
Baptisme he speaks of.</p>
            <p>This was a strait of dear affection to the Elect of
God: all these were blessed straits: but now a
strait caused by sin, these are imbittered and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed
by the guilt of sin, and sense of Gods
wrath. It is sin that maketh straits deserve the
name of straits: therefore you are spiritually mad
that commit sin to avoid straits.</p>
            <p>2. There is more evil in the least sin, then in the
greatest outward calamity whatsoever: this the
world will not beleeve: therefore Saint <hi>Austin</hi>
saith,<hi>That a man ought not to tell a lye, though he
might save all the world from hell: for there is more
evil in one lye, then there is good in the salvation of all
the world.</hi> I have often told you the story of Saint 
<hi>Austin:</hi>saith he, <hi>If hell were on one side, and sin on
the other, and I must choos one, I would choos hell rather
then sin: for God is the Author of hell, but it is blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy
to say he is the Author of sin.</hi>There is a famous
story of <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth King of <hi>France,</hi>he sent
a message to the Prince of <hi>Condy</hi> a zealous Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
gives him three things to choose, either to
go to Mass, or to be put to death, or to suffer ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
all his life long: saith he, <hi>Primum Deo
juvante nunquam eligo: The first (God helping) I
will never choose, I abhor the idolatry of the Mass:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54726:10"/>
but for the two other, I leave it to the choice of the King
to do as he pleases, there is more evil in the least
sin them the greatest misery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The third thing I would have you consider,
that whosoever goeth out of Gods way to avoid
danger, shall certainly meet with greater danger.
<hi>Balaam</hi> went out of Gods way, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 22. and
God sent an Angel with a drawn sword, and he ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
upon an Asse, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. the Angel stood in a
narrow place, where was no way to go from the
right hand or from the left: if his Ass had not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
under him, he had been run through by the
sword of the Angel. <hi>Ionah</hi> for fear of the King
of <hi>Nineveh</hi> went out of Gods way, but he met
with a mighty Tempest, he met with a Whale:
What do you do when you commit sin? you make
way to be cast into the eternal prison of hell: you
destroy your precious souls to save your perishing
bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 2. If sin be the father and mother of all
perplexity and distresses, then, I beseech you, let
us above all things in the world abhor sin: all the
curses of the Bible are all due only to a sinner; and
all the curses not named in the Bible: for that is
observable, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 36. every plague that is not
written in the book shall light upon him: there
are strange punishments to the workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>Iob.</hi> 31. 3, Is not destruction to the wicked a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54726:10"/>
strange punishment to the workers of iniquity;
sin it bringeth the sinner to little ease: little ease
at death, little ease at the day of judgement, and
little ease in hell, tribulation and anguish: the
word in the Greek is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, little ease to
every soul that doth iniquity. Oh my beloved, will
you promise me to look upon sin, and consider it
in all its woful consequents, as the father, mother,
and womb out of which come external, eternal,
and internal straits? more particularly there are
twelve sins I especially command you to take heed
of and avoid.</p>
            <p>1. Take heed of covetousness: the love of the
world will pierce you through with many sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes;
the love of money is the root of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;
the love of the world drowns men in perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</p>
            <p>2 Take heed of the sin of pride: into what woful
strait did pride bring <hi>Haman!</hi> God crossed him in
what he most desired: God made him hold the
stirrop, while <hi>Mordecai</hi> rode in triumph; and God
hanged him on the Gallows which he had made
for <hi>Mordecai.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Take heed of drunkennesse; look not on the
wine when it gives its colour in the cup, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
drunkennesse will bring you into snares, it will bite
like a Serpent, and sting like an Adder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:54726:11"/>
4. Take heed of disobedience and rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Commandements of God: it brought
<hi>Ionah</hi> to the three nights and three dayes in the
Whales belly.</p>
            <p>5. Take heed of fornication, and adultery, and
all uncleanness; this brought <hi>Sampson</hi> to a woful
strait: this brought <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> into great
perplexity.</p>
            <p>6. Take heed of oppression, and all acts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice:
this brought <hi>Ahab</hi> into a great strait, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that the dogs licked his blood.</p>
            <p>7. Take heed of unnecessary familiarity with
wicked men: this brought <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> into a great
strait.</p>
            <p>8. Take heed of mis-using the Prophets of God:
this made God destroy the Children of <hi>Israel</hi>
without remedy, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>9. Take heed of coming prophanely to the
Lords Table: this brought the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>
into a great distress, insomuch as the Apostle saith,
<hi>For this cause many among you are sick, and many
weak, and many fallen asleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. Take heed of loathing the Manna of your
souls: this brought the people of <hi>Israel</hi> into wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54726:11"/>
misery, that God destroyed all their carcasses
in the wildernesse, save <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Caleb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take heed of slighting the Gospel: this
brought Queen <hi>Maries</hi> persecution, as many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and godly men that fled for Religions sake out
of the Land, have confessed their unthankfulnesse
for, and unfruitfulnesse under the Gospel in King
<hi>Edward</hi> the sixth's time, brought the persecution
in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time.</p>
            <p>11. Take heed of losing your first Love: that
makes God threaten to take away his Candlestick.</p>
            <p>12. Take heed of prophaning the Christian Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
which is much prophaned every where; a
day that Christ by his resurrection from the dead
hath consecrated, to be kept holy to God: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
if the Jews were so severely punished for
breaking the Sabbath, which was set apart in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of the Creation, surely God will severely
punish those that break the Sabbath set apart in
memory of Christs Resurrection. May be some
will say, I have committed many of these sins,
but am not brought into any strait. Remember
it was nine months after <hi>David</hi> had numbred the
people, before he was in this strait: but as sure as
God is in heaven, sin will bring straits sooner or
later; though a sinner a hundred yeares, yet shall
he be accursed: may be thy posterity makes way
for thy damnation: and this is thy greatest distress,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54726:12"/>
that thou goest on in sin and prosperity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use</hi> 3. If sin bringeth a Nation into marvellous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinths,
learn what great caus we have to fear that
God should bring this Nation into great distress,
because of the great abominations are committed
in the midst of it; our King and Sovereign was in
great straits in the dayes of his banishment, but
God hath delivered him; God hath delivered this
Nation out of great straits, but alas, we requite
God evil for good, and instead of repenting for
old sins, we commit new sins. I am told there
are new oathes invented, oaths not fit to be named
in any place, much lesse here: Certainly the
drunkenness and adultery, the oppression and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice,
the bribery and Sabbath breaking, the vain
and wicked swearing and for-swearing this Nation
is guilty of, must of necessity provoke God to say
of us as he did of them in <hi>Ieremiah 15 29 Shall I
not visit for these things, saith the Lord? shall not
my soul be avenged on such a Nation as this?</hi> God will
not only punish us, but be avenged on us. There
is no way to avoid a national desolation, but by a
national reformation.</p>
            <p>Lastly, learn what cause you of this Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
and Parish, what cause you have to expect
that God should bring you into great straits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of your great unthank<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ulness and unfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
under the means of Grace, you that have so
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54726:12"/>
long enjoyed the Gospel; you have had the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
in this place in great abundance; Doctor
<hi>Taylor</hi> he served an apprenticeship in this place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Doctor <hi>Staughton</hi> served another apprenticeship:
and I, through divine Mercy, have served three
apprenticeships, and half another almost, among
you; you have had the Spirit of God seven and
thirty years in the faithful ministry of the Word,
knocking at the door of your hearts, but many of
you have hardened your hearts. Are there not
some of you, I only put the Question, that begin
to loath the Manna of your Souls, and to look
back towards <hi>Egypt</hi> again? Are there not some
of you have itching ears, and would fain have
Preachers that would feed you with dainty
phrases, and begin not to care for a Minister
that unrips your Consciences, speaks to your
hearts and souls, and would force you into heaven
by frighting you out of your sins? Are there not
some of you, that by often hearing Sermons, are
become Sermon-proof, that know to sleep and
scoffe away Sermons? I would be glad to say
there are but few such; but the Lord knoweth
there are too too many that by long preaching get
little good by preaching, insomuch that I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
said it, and say it now again, there is hardly any
way to raise the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ice of the Gospel-Ministry, but
by the want of it: And that I may not flatter you,
you have not profited under the means you have
enjoyed; therefore you may justly expect God
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54726:13"/>
may bring you into a strait, and take away the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
from you: God may justly take away your
Ministers by death or otherwise. Have you not
lost your first love? why did God take away the
Gospel from the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but because
they lost their first love? Are you not like the
Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> that are neither hot nor cold?
therefore God may justly spew you out of his
mouth; what God will do with you I know not,
a few weeks will determine: God can make a great
change in a little time: we leave all to God; but
in the mean time let me commend one Text of
