            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>ENTLE READER, Albeit the Authour of this Worke designed the same to be printed, and published togeather with his <hi>Supplement</hi> to Fa. <hi>Persons his Discussion of M. Barlowes Answere &amp;c.</hi> by reason of the relation that the one hath to the other (in which respect also this is intituled an <hi>Adioynder</hi>:) neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles for as much as afterwards, when this came to my hands, I vnderstood that <hi>M. Barlowes</hi> credit was already quyte crushed with the <hi>Disscussion</hi> of <hi>Fa. Persons,</hi> and euery where so decried, that most men were fully satisfyed, concerning his ignorance, absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
<pb facs="tcp:2416:3"/>
and folly, and therefore might be more desirous to see this <hi>Adioynder</hi> in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere of <hi>M. Doctour Andrews</hi> (as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his farre greater reputation, as for that he hath not yet byn answered by any in our tongue:) And considering also that this <hi>Adioynder</hi> is growne to a farre greater volume, then the Author at the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and that therefore many may desyre to haue it a part, both for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity of carryage, and also for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good respects; yea, and that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration thereof from the <hi>Supplement</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hinder, but that such as desyre to haue them both, may easely be satisfyed, and cause them to be bound eyther togeather, or a sunder, as they shall best lyke; I ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore resolued, with the good leaue of the Authour, to print, &amp; publish them both in seuerall volumes.</p>
            <p>For although this <hi>Adioynder,</hi> hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a great connexion with the <hi>Supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and in some sort dependeth thereon, (as being written only to iustifie the same, and specially concerning matters incident thereto:) yet the points treated therein
<pb facs="tcp:2416:3"/>
are so clearly handled, and discussed, that the truth of the Catholyke cause, and <hi>M. Andrewes</hi> his notable fraudes, and cauils, may sufficiently appeare thereby, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of the <hi>Supplement,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the frequent references thereto.</p>
            <p>I shall not need to say any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the intention, and drift of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, for that the same may fully be seene, partly by the titles of the Chapters which follow immediatly, and partly in the 3. first paragraphs of the first Chapter, and therefore all that I thinke good to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise thee, <hi>good Reader,</hi> is, that albeit this Authour hath not had eyther the occasion, or the intention to answere all <hi>M. Andrewes</hi> his Booke (but such points only, as are some way incide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the foresaid <hi>Supplement</hi>) neuertheles this <hi>Adioynder</hi> may serue for a sufficient answere to the whole, seeing it conteineth a confutation of at least an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Positions, Assertions, Paradoxes, Answeres, and Obiections of <hi>M. Andrewes</hi>; in all which he is proued to be eyther most Idle, and Impertinent, or egregiously fraudulent, and false, or els to argue dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly

               <hi>good Reader,</hi> know how far I meane to proceed therin, thou shalt vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that seeing my <hi>Supplement</hi> is already vnder the presse, and that I haue no more tyme to bestow on this <hi>Adioynder,</hi> but vntill the said <hi>Supplement</hi> be printed, I make account, that I shall haue opportunity to handle but a few points: in which respect I think good, to make choyce of such on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as concerne some of the most important matters, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               </note> and weight <hi>M. Andrewes</hi> his Answeres are touching the same, especially in his 16. &amp; 17. page, where he laboureth seriously to proue three wayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that our Sauiours words to <hi>S. Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>Pasce oues meas</hi> (alleaged, and learnedly vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Cardinall) do make nothing for vs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. First, he saith, that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> affirmeth that <hi>S. Peter</hi> had <hi>no peculiar increase</hi> by the word <hi>Pasce,</hi> and that <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> affirmeth the like of the words <hi>oues meas.</hi> And to the end that this may appeare, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to lay downe the very words of those two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aug. de Agon. Christ. c.</hi> 30.</note> Of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> thus; <hi>Cùm Petro dicitur, ad omnes

               <hi>Pasce oues meas</hi>: when it is said to <hi>Peter,</hi> it is said to all, Feed my sheep. Of <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> thus: <hi>Eas oues non solùm Beatus suscepit Petrus, sed &amp; nobiscum eas sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepit, &amp; nos cum illo accepimus omnes. Those sheep not only the blessed Peter receaued, but also he receaued them with vs, and we all receaued them with him.</hi> And then <hi>M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi> addeth: <hi>Nempe dictum illi Pasce</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for it was said vnto him, Feed, as well in the person of others, as in his owne,</hi> at<expan>

               </expan> vel sic iacebit Cardinali ratio sua: <hi>and so shall the Cardinalls reason serue him to no purpose.</hi> Thus argueth he.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But to the end, thou maist (<hi>good Reader</hi>) see, and note with what fidelity and conscience this man alledgeth the Fathers, I will lay downe the place of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> somewhat more amply then he hath done,<note place="margin">S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fraudule<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by M. Andrews.</note> whereby thou shalt easily discouer his notable fraud. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> in the place alledged by him saith thus: <hi>Non enim sine causa inter omnes Apostolos &amp;c. For not without cause doth Peter sustayne the person of the Catholike Church amongst all the Apostles, for to this Church the keyes of the Kingdome of heauen were giuen, when they were giuen to Peter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>August. vbi supra.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>and when it is said to him, Doest thou loue me? Feed my sheep, it is said to all, and therefore the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church ought willingly to pardon her Children when they are corrected, and strengthned in piety, seeing we see, that to Peter himselfe, bearing the person of the Church, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don was granted both when he had doubted vpon the sea &amp;c. and when he had thrice denyed his Maister &amp;c.</hi> Thus saith <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> declaring that <hi>Pasce oues</hi> (which our Sauiour said to <hi>S. Peter</hi>) was said to all the Church, because <hi>S. Peter</hi> bare the <hi>person of the Church</hi>: Which he did, by reason of the supreme authority that he had ouer the Church.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For else why should rather he, then others of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2416:7"/>
the Apostles be said to represent the whole Church, but because he was Head or supreme Gouernour therof;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cic. offic. l.</hi> 1.</note> which we may learne euen in <hi>Cicero,</hi>
               <note place="margin">How S. Peter did beare the person of the Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rch when he recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the keyes.</note> who saith that, <hi>Est proprium munus Magistratus</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It is the proper office</hi> or duty, <hi>of the Magistrate, to vnderstand that he beareth the person of the Citty.</hi> So he; speaking of the chiefe or supreme Magistrate: wherby it appeareth, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is giuen to the King, as King, and Head of the Common-wealth, the same is giuen to the Common-wealth, wherof he beareth and representeth the person: and so in like manner what was giuen to <hi>S. Peter</hi> as Head of the Church, the same was giuen to the Church which he representeth. For which cause also <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> saith, that <hi>Ecclesia est in Episcopo, the Church is in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>; and the reason is, because the Bishop is Head of the Church; &amp; as this is true in euery particuler Bishop, in respect of the particuler Church which he gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. So also is it most truly verified in the supreme and vniuersall Pastour, in respect of the whole Church whereof he is Head.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That this was <hi>S. Augustines</hi> meaning, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident by his owne doctrine in other places,<note place="margin">S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared out of his owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> where he sheweth plainly, that <hi>S. Peter</hi> bare the person of figure of the Church, in respect of his <hi>Primacy: Cuius Ecclesia,</hi> saith he, <hi>Petrus Apostolus propter Apostolatus sui primatum gerebat figurata generalitate personam &amp;c.

               </note> 
               <hi>figuring, or representing the generality therof. For if we respect what did belong properly to himselfe, he was by nature one man, by grace one Christian, and by a more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundant grace,</hi> vnus, idem<expan>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2416:8"/>
vniuersall Church.</hi> Thus saith <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> teaching euidently, that <hi>S. Peter</hi> bare the person of the Church, by reason of the <hi>Primacy of his Apostleship,</hi> that is to say, because he was the chiefe Apostle; which the same ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father signifieth also more plainly in another place, saying,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Idem in Ps.</hi> 108.</note> 
               <hi>Cuius Ecclesiae ille agnoscitur gessisse persona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> propter Primatum quem in Discipulis habuit: Of which Church he is acknowledged to haue borne the person for the Primacy, which he had amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst the Disciples.</hi> And to the same purpose he saith also elswhere,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Idem ser.</hi> 13. <hi>de verb. Dom.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Petrus à petra cognominatus</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taking his name from a Rock, was happy, bearing the figure of the Church, hauing the principality of the Apostleship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Loe then, for what cause <hi>S. Augustine</hi> said, that when <hi>Christ</hi> gaue to <hi>S. Peter</hi> the keyes of heauen &amp; pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall authority to feed his sheep,<note place="margin">M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes fraud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the intention of S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine.</note> he gaue the same to all the Church, to wit, because <hi>S. Peter</hi> hauing the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, or primacy of the Apostolicall dignity</hi> (and being consequently chiefe Pastor, and head of the Church) did <hi>beare,</hi> and represent the <hi>person,</hi> or <hi>figure</hi> of the whole <hi>Church.</hi> So that you see the place which <hi>M. Andrewes</hi> bringeth out of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> against the Primacy of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> maketh notably for it, if it be considered with the circumstances therof, which he cunningly, and craftily concealed. But in the other place which he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out of <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> he is more fraudulent, hauing plainly corrupted the text, which as it is in <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> is very conforme to this doctrine of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying nothing else but that all the lawfull Pastors in Gods Church,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Ambr. de Sacerd. dignit. c</hi> 1.</note> receaued their Pastorall authority ouer their flocks, with <hi>S. Peter</hi>: and therfore he saith, <hi>Quas oues, &amp; quem gregem non solùm tunc Beatus Petrus suscepit, sed &amp; cum, illo eas nos suscepimus omnes: Which sheep, and which flock not only the Blessed Peter then receaued, but as so
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2416:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we all receaued them with him.</hi> Thus saith <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> which all Catholikes do graunt and teach in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, because (as I haue said) <hi>S. Peter</hi> representing the person of the whole Church (wherof he was head) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued not that Pastorall authority for himselfe alone, but also for the Church.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In which respect <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> saith very well,<note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of S.

care what he saith, or sparke of shame, he would not haue affirmed this so resolutly as he hath done, seeing that the very words, and text of the <hi>Canon</hi> it selfe do euince the contrary.

Truly no; but rather should notably confirme theyr primacy, and vtterly ouerthrow his owne cause, seeing that it is most euident, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> was such, that his only opposition to that <hi>Canon,</hi> and his abrogation therof sufficed to ouerthrow, &amp; disanull it; which I will take a litle paynes to proue by the whole course, and practise of the Church, euen from that Councell, vntill the ruine of the Greeke Church and Empyre, which though it be needlesse in respect of the learned, yet I hope it will not be altogeather fruitles to the more ignorant, and vnlearned, and may serue for an aboundant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiction of <hi>M.

            <p n="12">12. To this purpose I wish it to be noted, what <hi>Gelasius</hi> (who liued at the same tyme, and was Pope about 30. yeares after <hi>Leo</hi>) wrote to the Bishops of <hi>Dardania,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Foure things to be noted in an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of Pope Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasius for the inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> concerning a schisme raysed by <hi>Acatius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the tyme of Pope <hi>Felix</hi> his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, in which Epistle he signifyeth 4. things specially to be noted for this purpose. First, that the Emperour <hi>Martian</hi> (though he had made great instance to Pope <hi>Leo</hi> for the aduancement of the Church of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> yet) did highly prayse, and commend the said Pope, for that he would not by any meanes suffer the rules of the Canons to be violated in that point. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that <hi>Anatolius</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:2416:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whose fauour that <hi>Canon</hi> was made (being most seuerely reprehended by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> for his ambitious attempt) excused himself, laying the fault vpon the Clergy of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and affirming, <hi>in Apostolici Praesulis totum positum potestate,</hi> that all the matter was in the power of the Apostolicall Prelate, that is to say of Pope <hi>Leo.</hi> Thirdly, that the Emperour <hi>Leo</hi> who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Martian</hi> before Pope <hi>Leo</hi> dyed, attempting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few yeares after to obtayne the same priuiledges for the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinople</hi> in the tyme of Pope <hi>Simplicius,</hi> was flatly denyed them, and that it was declared vnto him by <hi>Probus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Canusium</hi> the Popes Legat, <hi>nullatenus posse tentari,</hi> that it might by no meanes be attempted.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Finally <hi>Gelasius</hi> also signifyeth, that <hi>Acatius</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who raysed the Schisme wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he writeth, and was therefore excommunicated by Pope <hi>Felix,</hi> was himself so subiect, &amp; obedient to the Roman Sea, before he fell into that schisme, that he procured the Pope to censure, and depriue the Bishops of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> yea and was himself exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of the Popes sentence against them, and that therefore falling also himself afterwards into the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of the condemned Bishops (vpon whome he had executed the Popes sentence of condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) he deserued no lesse to be condemned then they. All this witnesseth <hi>Gelasius</hi>; whereby it appeareth euidently that from the tyme of the Councel of <hi>Calcedon</hi> to his raigne, which was about 40. yeares, the <hi>Canon</hi> whereupon <hi>M. Andrewes</hi> relyeth, was not held to be of any waight, for the exemption of the Church of <hi>Constantinople</hi> from the subiection of the Church to the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea. For if the Canon had then had any such force, neyther
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2416:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would the Emperour <hi>Martian</hi> haue hyghly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Pope <hi>Leo</hi> for resisting it, nor <hi>Anatolius</hi> (in whose fauour it was made) would haue excused himself for procuring it, and acknowledged the matter to depend wholy vpon Pope <hi>Leo's</hi> determination: neyther should <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperour haue needed to haue renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that suit to Pope <hi>Simplicius</hi>; neyther yet would <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> haue yielded, as he did, for a tyme, to obay the Pope, and to execute his sentence vpon other <hi>Grecian</hi> Bishops.</p>

his fault, to promise amendment, yea to procure the Emperour to be a suiter, and intercessor for him; and finally to receiue, and execute Pope <hi>Leo's</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, lawes, and ordinances in the Church of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> as though he had bene some <hi>Italian</hi> Bishop within the Suburbs of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that I hope, thou seest <hi>good Reader,</hi> that I haue now clearely proued 2. things.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2416:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
publike good thereof; yet a Pastor, or Gouernour is most bound thereto, as to that which most properly pertayneth to his charge, &amp; vocation. As for example in the tyme of the Apostles the heresy of the <hi>Nicolaits</hi> did violate the vnion, and trouble the peace of the whole Church; and albeit there were in the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> as well <hi>Prophets, Doctors, Preachers,</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> as other faithfull people, who were all bound to haue care of the vnity of the whole Church (as all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are) neuertheles we see in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> that none of them but the Bishop only,<note place="margin">

            <p n="55">55. So that whereas <hi>M. Andrews</hi> imposeth an equal obligation of the same care vpon euery member, what doth he els but make, as I may say, a <hi>gally-maufrey,</hi>

For if his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2416:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
band in that behalfe were equal with the band of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, he could not with reason be denyed equality with them in charge, and commission; seeing that equality of obligation requireth equality and parity of power to performe it,<note place="margin">Equality of obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth equality of care.</note> for when power of performance wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, the obligation ceaseth. So that a greater power and dignity induceth an obligation of greater care; and therefore let <hi>M. Andrews</hi> consider what a wise, and learned proposition he hath made, and published to the world, and what a good and vigilant Pastour he is, who teacheth such dangerous, and seditious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p n="56">56. And albeit (to auoyde this absurdity) he should restrayne his generall propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Pastors only, and say, that whatsoeuer violateth the vnity of the whole Church doth belong equally to the care of all Pastors; yet he were no lesse ridiculous then before, seeing that he must needs acknowledge an inequality of obligation, and care euen amongst them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their different degrees. For if a <hi>Patriarke</hi> haue iurisdiction ouer <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> and they ouer <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> ouer <hi>Priests,</hi> it is cleare, that as their charge, and degree is vnequal; so also is the obligation of euery one of them different, and conforme to his dignity, degree, and authority. And therefore although the office and duty of euery Pastour, is, as I haue sayd, to haue special care of the vnity, and peace of the Church, yet his obligation in that behalfe must needs be so much the greater, by how much his power, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is greater, and he more able to performe it then others his inferiours, to which purpose the Prophet saith of a Prince, or supreme Pastor: <hi>Princeps ea quae sunt digna Principe cogitabit,</hi>

The Prince shall thinke those things which are worthy of a Prince, and he shall be ouer Dukes, or captaynes. So saith <hi>Isay</hi> of our Sauiour (as some expound it) or, as others say, of <hi>Iosias</hi> King of <hi>Iuda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="57">57. But of whom soeuer it is to be vnderstood, it is manifest inough, that the forme of a good Pastor, or Gouernour is prescrybed therein, shewing that the Prince being the supreme Gouernour, is to imbrace cogitations, and thoughtes fit for his estate, and as much excelling the cogitations of his Dukes, or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes (that is to say of his inferiour, or subordinate Magistrats) as he excelleth them in degree; and what thought is so worthy of a Prince, as the care of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and peace of his estate, wherein consisteth the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyke, and generall good of euery Common welth?

            </p>
            <p n="60">60. Therefore I beseech thee <hi>(good Reader)</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider a little <hi>M.

               <q>
                  <hi>Quod ergo habet Roma de Primatu</hi> &amp;c.
Therefore that which <hi>Rome</hi> hath of the Primacy, is not from Christ, but from the Fathers, and in respect of the Emperours Seat, and not for the Sea of <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="61">61. VVhereto I answere, first that <hi>M. Andrews</hi> must learne to distinguish betwixt the <hi>Primacy</hi> of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and the priuiledges granted to the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> for that the sayd <hi>Primacy</hi> could not be from any, but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2416:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe; whereas the Roman Church may haue, and hath priuiledges from men, that is to say not only from generall Councells, but also from temporall Princes, as from <hi>Constantine, Pepin, Charles</hi> the Great, and other Catholike Princes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>M. Andrews</hi> argueth most absurdly from the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges,</hi> to the <hi>Primacy,</hi> denying that the <hi>Primacy</hi> was from Christ, because the <hi>Priuiledges</hi> were from men, and some of them giuen for humane respects; wherin he sheweth himselfe as wyse, as if he should deny the regalty, and soueraignty of our Kings, by reason of the prerogatiues, and priuiledges granted to them by the Parliaments; or as if he should say, that the Church of Christ (which is his Spouse) was not instituted by him, but by men, because aswell temporall Princes, as generall Councells haue giuen great priuiledges thereto.</p>
            <p n="62">62. Secondly I say, that <hi>M. Andrewes</hi> is very sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple if he see not,<note place="margin">Why those which penned the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alledged by M.

                  </gap>rs</hi> Sea; seeing that the same could not any way further the pretence of the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> but rather hinder it. For what could he demaund for any of those respects? Would <hi>M. Andrews</hi> haue had him to say that because Christ gaue <hi>S. Peter</hi> the keyes and commission to feed his sheepe, therefore it was conuenient that the Councell should also giue the lyke authority to the Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> or prefer him before the Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> (which was in deed his demaund?) how would this conclusion follow of those premisses? Whereas
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2416:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the other consequent was not so euill, to wit, that because the <hi>Roman</hi> Church had ben in tymes past priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by reason of the Imperiall Seat, it was conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, that also the Church of <hi>Constantinople</hi> should haue like priuiledges for the same reason.</p>
            <p n="63">63. Agayne, what should the Bishop of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> haue gayned by mentioning priuiledges granted to <hi>Peters</hi> Sea? Should he not haue hindred his owne cause thereby, and pleaded against himselfe for <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch?</hi> For who knoweth not, that <hi>S.

            <p n="64">64. For hauing sayd that which you haue heard before concerning priuiledges granted by the Fathers to the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea (because <hi>Rome</hi> was then the Imperial Citty) he addeth:<note place="margin">

So he: wherein he not only falsifieth the sense, and meaning of the Canon (in that he maketh it to giue an absolute <hi>equality</hi> to the Church of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with that of <hi>Rome</hi>) but also craftily leaueth out all mention of the <hi>second place after Rome,</hi>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2416:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as I haue amply declared before.</p>
            <p n="65">65. And as for the Greeke words which he cyteth to fortify his forgery, they do not extend so far, as he would stretch them (I meane) to make a parity, and equality in dignity; for whereas the <hi>Greeke</hi> text saith, that <hi>Constantinople should be magnifyed, as Rome was,</hi> the same may very well stand with the foresayd equality, which <hi>distributiue Iustice</hi> ordayneth (to wit, with the reseruation of the different dignityes of the one, and the other) as when a Noble man, and a meane man do concurre in one act, or seruice to the Common welth, and both of them are rewarded, and aduanced accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their different qualityes, it may truly be sayd that the meane man is aduanced as the Noble man is, though not to the same degree, for both of them are aduanced, as well the one, as the other, and yet they are not made equal in dignity.</p>
            <p n="66">66. But now if we take the Greeke wordes allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>M.

Peters</hi> Sea, the <hi>Canon</hi> speaketh not at all (because the mention of it would haue bene nothing to the purpose of the <hi>Canon,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against it, as I haue sufficiently declared:) and therfore this part of the conclusion is cleane from the matter, and cannot possibly be drawne from the <hi>Canon</hi> wherupon he groundeth all his arguments.</p>
            <p n="68">68. The other part is also no lesse friuolous then the former, for whereas he concludeth that the Fathers of the Councell of <hi>Calcedon</hi> held not the <hi>Primacy</hi> of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> for a matter of <hi>faith,</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they made the Church of <hi>Constantinople</hi> equal with the <hi>Roman</hi> Sea, you see that all the <hi>equality</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he buyldeth, is but his owne fiction, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant to that very <hi>Canon,</hi> which he layeth for his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2416:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and yet forsooth, he is not ashamed to triumph and insult against the Cardinall, exacting of him some <hi>Canon</hi> of the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> for the Popes Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, as though he himselfe had knockt him downe with a Canon: for thus he saith for an vpshot, and final conclusion of all this matter.</p>

The most holy, and most blessed Archbishop of the elder and great <hi>Rome Leo,</hi> hath depriued him (to wit <hi>Dioscorus</hi>) as well of all Episcopall dignity, as priestly ministery, by vs and this holy Synod, togeather with the thrice most blessed, and prayse-worthy <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle, who is the rock and top of the Church, and he which is the foundation of the true faith.</q>
This was the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence giuen by the Popes Legats against <hi>Dioscorus</hi>; which sentence euery Bishop in the Councell not only approued particulerly with his suffrage, or voyce, but also confirmed with his subscription,<note place="margin">Three things to be noted in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Dioscorus prouing Pope Leo's su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy.</note> as it appeareth in the 3. Action of the sayd Councell.</p>
            <p n="77">77. Wherein it is to be obserued. First; that Pope <hi>Leo</hi> deposed <hi>Dioscorus</hi> by the <hi>Synod,</hi> whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that he was president, and head thereof, and that the sayd <hi>Synod</hi> was but, as it were, his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in that deposition. Secondly, that he deposed him by the authority which he had, as successor to <hi>S.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2416:54"/>
Peter</hi>; in which respect it is sayd here that he did it, <hi>togeather with the most blessed Apostle Peter.</hi> Thyrdly, that for as much as <hi>S. Peter</hi> is heere acknowledged to be the head of the Church (as being the <hi>rock, and top thereof,</hi> and <hi>the foundation of the faith</hi>) the like must needs be granted of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> who was his successor, and exercysed his authority. Lastly, seeing that this sentence of deposition giuen against <hi>Dioscorus</hi> in this manner, and with these circumstances, was receiued particulerly, and subscrybed by euery one in that Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, without any contradiction, or exception taken to any part thereof, it is euident, that the whole was conforme to the faith, and beliefe of the Councell, and consequently that they held Pope <hi>Leo</hi> not only for <hi>S.

            <p n="78">78. Also it appeareth in the same Councell that <hi>Theodoretus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Cyrus</hi> (who being deposed by <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> appealed to Pope <hi>Leo</hi>) was by his authority restored to his seat,<note place="margin">

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2416:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>light</hi> of the Church proceedeth not only from Christ, but also from him, as from the head thereof vnder <hi>Christ,</hi> and that by his authority it is spread euery where throughout the Church.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And this is sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to make good the similitude according to the intention of <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> who only speaketh here of the Church, as of a body receiuing all the vnity of her seueral &amp; many parts from the head, as the light which is spread thoughout the world, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaueth vnity from the sunne; &amp; therfore he argueth thus in substance:<note place="margin">The vini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church notably proued, and dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by S.

               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:2416:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>10. And to this is also conforme the rest of <hi>S. Cyprians</hi> text, which <hi>M. Andrews</hi> proceedeth to lay downe thus; <q>
                  <hi>Ramos suos Ecclesia</hi> &amp;c. The Church, through her aboundant fertility, stretcheth forth her branches ouer the whole earth, and largely spreadeth abroad her copious riuers, or brookes, yet the <hi>head</hi> is one, the <hi>origen,</hi> or <hi>beginning</hi> one, and <hi>one mother</hi> &amp;c.</q> So sayth <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> teaching, as you see, nothing els in effect, but that the Church being a body disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ouer the whole world in her members, is vnited in <hi>one head,</hi> and therefore he saith, <hi>vnum tamen caput, &amp; origo vna,</hi> yet the head is one, and the origen, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning one: and so hauing spoken as well of the <hi>head</hi> of the Church, as of the <hi>body,</hi> and declared from whence the vnity of the whole is deryued, he had great reason to adde <hi>vna mater, one mother,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Why the Church is called one Mother.</note> giuing to vnderstand that as the Church hath one head, so she is <hi>one mother</hi>; one, in respect of her vnity deryued from her <hi>head,</hi> and <hi>mother,</hi> because she is the <hi>spouse</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and hath children dispersed throughout the world.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And thus may <hi>M. Andrews</hi> see, that albeit <hi>S. Peter</hi> is not called in <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> a <hi>Mother,</hi>

For if <hi>M. Andrews</hi> will say heere (as he is wont) that they were all foundations and gouernours of the Church alike, why was he called a <hi>Rock</hi> more then they? or what was the priuiledge of <hi>Peter</hi> whereof <hi>Nazianzen</hi> speaketh heere, according

to <hi>M. Andrews</hi> his owne confession, who graunteth that <hi>Nazianzen</hi> testifieth that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were <hi>aliquo priuilegio prae ceteris donati,</hi> priuiledged in some things aboue the rest?</p>
            <p n="8">8. Therefore if <hi>M. Andrews</hi> will allow any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer priuiledge to S. <hi>Iohns</hi> layning vpon <hi>Christs</hi> brest, as he must needs do (for I thinke he will not be so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to say that the same is also to be vnderstood of all the rest) he must needs graunt that <hi>Peter</hi> had also a particuler priuiledge not only in the name of a <hi>Rock,</hi> but also in that which was signifyed thereby, that is to say, in that the foundations of the Church were committed particulerly to his charge (as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> speaketh) by which <hi>Metaphore</hi> he signifyeth sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was made supreme Gouernour of the Church, as hath bene declared heretofore, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore those words of <hi>Nazianzen (atque Ecclesiae funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta fidei suae credita habeat)</hi> wherein consisteth the force of the obiection, seemed to <hi>M.

            <p n="9">9. But what shall we say of his absurd inference or conclusion,<note place="margin">M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent trifling.</note> when he saith, that because a priuiledge was giuen to <hi>Iohn,</hi> as well as to <hi>Peter,</hi> therefore there was eyther <hi>nullus,</hi> or <hi>duplex primatus, a double primacy,</hi> or <hi>none at all</hi>? Shall we thinke so great a Doctour, as <hi>M. Andrews,</hi> to be so simple, as not to see how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently he try fleth therein? For what coherence is there betwixt those two priuiledges wherby he should make that inference in them both? especially seeing that he himselfe will, I am sure, deny one part thereof (to wit the double primacy) no lesse then we, and the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2416:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
other part is also sufficiently contradicted, not only by <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> but also by himselfe, as I haue shewed amply in the last Chapter, where I haue declared, how <hi>S. Hierome</hi> answered <hi>Iouinians</hi> obiection, that the Church was founded vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> and not vpon <hi>Iohn,</hi> by occasion whereof <hi>S. Hierome</hi> teacheth, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Iohn</hi> was more fauoured and beloued of our Sauiour then the rest of the Apostles for his Virginity, yet <hi>Peter</hi> was preferred before him in the primacy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made <hi>head</hi> of them all to take away the occasion of schisme, and thereby ouerthroweth this his inference of a double primacy or none.</p>
            <p n="10">10. For if <hi>Peter</hi> were <hi>head</hi> of the Apostles, he was also head of the Church, and consequently there was one primate, or head, and not two, notwithstanding that <hi>Iohn</hi> layned vpon <hi>Christs</hi> brest, and was more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of Christ then the rest; so as <hi>M.

            <p n="51">51. And now to conclude vpon these premisses 3. things do euidently follow thereon. The first, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Appeales of Bishops from <hi>Africk</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer prohibited, or so much as interrupted by any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, or Canons, and much lesse by the letters of the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2416:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>African</hi> Synode to Pope <hi>Celestinus.</hi> The second that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the Canon of the Councell of <hi>Mileuis</hi> which <hi>M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi> seemeth to alledge (as forbidding appeales to <hi>Rome,</hi> vnder payne of excommunication) did only concerne Priests and Deacons, and other Clergy men of the inferiour sort, and therefore did not prohibite the Appeales of Bishops, and much lesse of all men in generall, besides that being made with the Popes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent it was not any way preiudicall to the authority of the Sea Apostolike. The third, that <hi>M. Andrews</hi> iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> notably with his Reader, when he saith as out of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">M. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews maketh no bones to falsify whole Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods and bely the Fathers.</note> 
               <hi>Ad eum transmarinus nemo appellet &amp;c. To him</hi> (that is to say to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>) <hi>let no man appeale from beyond the seas: or if he appeale, he is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by Augustine,</hi> for neyther those words nor the sense thereof are to be found any where in <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> who, as you haue seene, expressely taught and practised the contrary. So that <hi>transmarinus nemo</hi> being set downe by <hi>M. Andrews</hi> in a different letter to be noted, is indeed worth the noting for a notable fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, and a flat corruption of the Canon, and abuse of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and of all the Bishops in that Councell.

            <p n="52">52. And now to say somewhat of the third, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth as you haue heard, that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> was far from acknowledging the Popes <hi>Zosimus, Bonifacius</hi> and <hi>Celestinus</hi> for heads of the Church, whereof you haue already seene the contrary in two of them, to wit <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> and <hi>Celestinus,</hi> whose power, and custome

               </note> And that <hi>S.

            </p>
            <p n="53">53. Whereby it is manifest that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in Pope <hi>Zosimus</hi> an Ecclesiasticall power, and authority to impose vpon him, and other Bishops a necessity to obay his commaundements in matters concerning the seruice of God, and the Church, which <hi>Zosimus</hi> could not do otherwise then as supreme and vniuersall Pastor, or head of the Church, for that the Church of <hi>Africk</hi> was not otherwise subiect to him, then as all other Churches were. But of Pope <hi>Zosimus,</hi> and of S. <hi>Augustines</hi> opinion concerning his Primacy I shall haue occasion to speake further after a while: and in the meane tyme this I hope may suffise to proue that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> was so far from impugning these
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2416:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
three Popes, that he acknowledged their supreme and vniuersall authority, and consequently that they were heads of the vniuersall Church, notwithstanding <hi>M.

            <p n="54">54. Whereupon it also followeth, that he forgot himselfe much more when he so confidently affirmed in the first poynt, as you haue heard, that the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>S. Augustines</hi> tyme, were but only heads of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which I noted before. For the first of the 3. vntruthes, though I remitted the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer answere thereof vntill I had discouered the other two, because they would not a litle help to the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of the first, as you may haue already noted; for it being cleare by all this former discourse that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales from <hi>Africk</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> were vsuall, frequent, and neuer prohibited in <hi>S. Augustines</hi> tyme; and againe that he acknowledged an authority and power in Pope <hi>Zosimus</hi> to lay iniunctions, &amp; commaundements vpon him, and other Bishops in <hi>Africk,</hi> it must needs follow that the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> had a more ample au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in his dayes then ouer the particuler Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p n="56">56.

for you perhaps haue found a way how a man may inuocate those in whome you your selues say you do not belieue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he (to wit the Apostle) seemed then to haue found no way.</q>
Thus saith <hi>M. Andrews</hi>: wherein it is to be noted, that one speciall reason why he rejecteth our doctrine concerning prayer to Saynts, is, for that we do <hi>inuocate</hi> them; because in his conceipt, <hi>Inuocation</hi> is so proper to God alone, that none can be <hi>inuocated</hi> but he; and if he do not conceiue so, why doth he insist so much vpon the word <hi>inuocate,</hi> yea, and seeke to terrify vs with his <hi>terret no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Apostolus,</hi> charging vs to make <hi>light of him,</hi> because we <hi>inuocate</hi> them in whome
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:2416:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we belieue not, that is to say, those whome we do not hold for God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But a man may wonder how this great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor could so grossely erre in a matter so euident as this, seeing that the words of the Apostle immediatly going before, do manifestly shew, that he speaketh there of an <hi>inuocation</hi> due to God alone, as to our chiefe Lord; which kind of <hi>inuocation</hi> is not communicable to creatures; and therefore the Apostle hauing sayd, that God is <hi>Dominus omnium &amp;c. the Lord of all, and rich,</hi> or bountifull;<note place="margin">

               <hi>towards all that inuocate him,</hi> he confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it with the saying of the Prophet, <hi>omnis qui inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauerit nomen Domini saluus erit,</hi>

                  <hi>Ioel.</hi> 2.</note> euery one that shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate the name of our Lord shalbe saued, and then he addeth,<note place="margin">The true meaning of S.

               <hi>Quomodo inuocabunt eum in quem non crediderunt?</hi> How shall they inuocate him, in whome they haue not belieued? as who would say, how can they inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him, of whome the Prophet speaketh, <hi>him that is Dominus omnium,</hi> the Lord of all, except they belieue in him, that is to say, except they belieue him to be their Lord, and Creatour. Whereby he doth not signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy that none but God can be inuocated in any sort, but that we cannot inuocate God, as our Lord, and our God, except we belieue him so to be.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And this doth not contradict the <hi>Inuocation</hi> of Saynts in another respect, to wit (not as Gods) but as the seruants of God, whome he glorifyeth, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and by whose intercession, and mediation he bestoweth graces, and fauours vpon men: in which sense it may also be truly said, that we cannot <hi>inuocate</hi> them, or craue the helpe of their prayers, except we do in some sort belieue in them (I meane) so far forth as we <hi>inuocate them,</hi> that is to, say except we belieue
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:2416:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them to be Gods seruants, and that we also haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in them, as in those, who by Gods goodnes may helpe vs. So as a faith, and beliefe in Saynts, is also necessary for the <hi>inuocation</hi> of them, though it is not the faith that we haue in God, as in our chiefe Lord, and Creatour; and that we may haue faith in Saynts, <hi>M. Andrewes</hi> may learne in the <hi>Apostle</hi> himselfe, who commendeth the charity,<note place="margin">

               </note> and faith which <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> had <hi>in Domino Iesu, &amp; in omnes Sanctos, in our Lord Iesus, and in all Saynts</hi>; vpon which words <hi>S. Hierome</hi> in his Commentary vpon that Epistle discourseth amply,<note place="margin">

            <p n="5">5. Therefore <hi>M.

Afterwards he speaketh both of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer Temple, and Church in <hi>Caesarea</hi> dedicated to those Martyrs (where it seemeth he made his Oration, or sermon) and also of the Martyrs themselues. <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium,</hi>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:2416:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sayth he, <hi>fratres dilectissimi</hi> &amp;c.; <hi>most louing Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren we haue this benefit, and perpetuall fauour of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, heere is a ready helpe for Christians, to wit, a Church of Martyrs, an army of the triumphant, a quyre of those that prayse God.</hi> So he.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Then he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinueth his speach of the Martyrs, signifying that whereas they were wont to vse greate diligence to fynd out some one intercessor for them, <hi>Quadraginta,</hi> sayth he, <hi>sunt hi &amp;c. These Martyrs are fourty praying altogeather, for seeing God is where one or two are gathered in his name, who can doubt that God is present where there are fourty? He that is afflicted which any griefe, hath refuge, or recourse to these, and he which is ioyfull, or merry doth runne to these</hi> &amp;c. Thus sayth S. <hi>Basil</hi> speaking sometymes, as you see, of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs themselues, and sometymes of the place where their reliques were reserued, &amp; they honoured in their reliques.</p>
            <p n="13">13. And therefore he passeth also now from them agayne to speake of the place, and to shew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the notable effects, and the temporall benefits which the people might expect by their recourse to the Martyrs, saying: <hi>Hic, mulier pia orans pro filijs auditur &amp;c. Heere, the deuout woman praying for her children is heard, and craueth a safe returne for her husband, when he is in his iourney, and health for him when he is sick.</hi> And then he concludeth concerning the Martyrs themselues, <hi>cum his ergo Martyribus nostrae fiant preces, therefore let vs pray with these Martyrs</hi>; in all which you see he exhorteth the people not only to haue recourse to these Martyrs in their necessities, but also finally to pray with them, because our prayers to Saynts doe litle auayle vs, except we also pray to God for our
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:2416:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>

the word <hi>Crypta,</hi> for that <hi>Vossius</hi> the Translatour signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth in his Epistle to the reader, in the beginning of the first Tome, that he had a speciall help for his tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, by two very ancient manuscripts, or written copyes of S. <hi>Ephrems</hi> workes, which are to be seene in <hi>Crypta ferrata</hi> (a famous monastery neere to <hi>Rome</hi> called, commonly in Italian <hi>Grotta ferrata</hi>) of which manuscripts the one was written in the yeare of our Lord 531.</p>
            <p n="44">44. But what cause had <hi>M. Andrews</hi> to iest at this? Sure I am, that in the iudgement of any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent man, it may serue for no small iustification of the translatour, that he fortifyeth his translation with the authority of such an ancient manuscript, written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue eleuen hundreth yeares agoe, and yet extant to seene so neere to <hi>Rome,</hi> where his Tomes were printed, especially seeing that there is such continuall recourse, and confluence thither from <hi>Rome</hi> (by reason of the celebrity of that Monastery) that he might well think he should quickly be discouered for an impudent, and notable lyar, in case he should faygne the same. And therefore for his further iustification in this poynt, he also directeth his Reader to the very Classe where the sayd manuscripts are, to be found in the Library of <hi>Grotta ferrata,</hi> to wit, vnder the tytles of these Greeke letters ω, and ΤΤ. Besyds, that he declareth also further that he conferred the same copyes with dyuers other which he saw, and are yet to be seene in the <hi>Vatican</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the library of Cardinall <hi>Sforza.</hi>

               </gap>: that is to say, <hi>and which hath (or weareth) the diademe prayeth to the tent-maker, and the fisher, as to his patrons, yea though they be dead.</hi> Thus sayth S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in the same place immediatly after the words alledged by the Cardinall, as it may be seene not only in the 66. homily <hi>ad populum Antiochenu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> but also in the homilyes vpon the Epistle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> which are acknowledged by all men to be S. <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> works.

            <p n="52">52. For by this it appeareth sufficiently, first, that the custome, and practise of prayer to Saynts was vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall, I meane both in the Latin, and in the Greeke Church in the tyme of <hi>S.

expressely by naming the two principall Cittyes, and Imperiall Seates, to wit <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where the same was in vre. Secondly it appeareth that it was not practised only by some obscure person (as <hi>M.

Thirdly it is euident by this place, that S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hyghly approued this custome and belieued it to be most necessary, and conforme to the Christian and Catholyke verity, seing he doth notably vrge, and exaggerate the same, for the instruction, and edificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the people, to shew vnto them, not only the great dignity, and glory of Gods seruants, and Saynts, but also the Omnipotent power, and diuinity of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Christ.</p>
            <p n="53">53. Whereupon it also followeth, that <hi>M.

And therefore whereas he contemneth such a fact as this of most Christian &amp; worthy Emperours, so testifyed,<note place="margin">M.

Chrysostome</hi> touching the same. And whereas he addeth for the conclusion of this poynt, that this fact related by <hi>S.

            <p n="35">35.

               <hi>M. Andrews</hi> would haue it to be supposed in this other case? What then will he say of a poynt which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe alloweth concerning the intercession of Saynts, to wit, not only that they pray for vs, but also that we may pray to God to heare and help vs by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession, which he granteth to be lawfull, albeit there would be no mention of it in that booke of <hi>S.

               </note> if there were any such, for he himselfe confesseth, that there is no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therein at all of Saynts; will he therefore allow vs to inferre herevpon, that <hi>S.

Andrewes</hi> doth, but that I am not ignorant (as neyther he, me thinks, should be) that such an argument <hi>ab authoritate negatiua</hi> (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it may sometymes serue for a light or bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture) yet can neuer passe for a proofe amongst lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, especially to such purpose as he vrgeth it here, to wit to ouerthrow an authors expresse doctrine in one place, by his silence thereof in another; for who knoweth not that all authors haue certaine principall intentions in their workes and treatises, whereto spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:2416:156"/>
tendeth all their discours; and that they are not any way bound to handle other by-questions further then they thinke conuenient? wherein also euery one hath his reasons (though vnknowne to others) why he handleth one poynt, more then some other, which may perhaps seeme no lesse pertinent to his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect then that which he handleth; neyther is he to be controlled or blamed for the same, if he performe as much as he eyther promiseth or specially intendeth. And therefore although <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> had written such a booke concerning prayer, as <hi>M. Andrews</hi> forgeth, yet his silence therein touching prayer to Saynts, could not preiudice his expresse doctrine thereof in his other workes.</p>
            <p n="38">38. Well then to conclude co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this poynt, I hope, <hi>good Reader,</hi> thou hast noted diuers thinges worthy to be considered; as first that <hi>M. Andrews</hi> hath not only reiected <hi>S.

Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose.</note> which neuer any man els I dare say (except perhaps some other Sectary of this age) euer so much as suspected, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined in that holy Father. Secondly promising to proue by a knowne sentence of <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> that he changed his mynd afterwards in that poynt, he alledgeth a worke, which in the opinion of diuers learned men was not written by <hi>S. Ambrose</hi>; besydes that the place which he produceth is nothing at all to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, for the which he alledgeth it. Thirdly laying downe the true words of another place in a true worke of <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> he hath fraudulently dissembled &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed that which immediatly followeth, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discouereth, but also ouerthroweth his false constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:2416:156"/>
thereof; and lastly he hath coyned a new worke of <hi>S. Ambrose,</hi> neuer heard of by any, but by himselfe, whereby also he could gayne nothing if there were any such. So as now I report me to thee, <hi>good Reader,</hi> whether he hath not quit himselfe well in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere of the Cardinalls obiection out of <hi>S.

if we consider what hath byn already proued by the testimonyes of those holy Fathers which haue hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto byn produced; by the which it is euident that the common custome of Christians was at that tyme to pray to Saynts, and Martyrs, at their tombes, and monuments; and amongst the rest <hi>S.

            <p n="57">57.

               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:2416:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>58.

            <p n="59">59. This will yet further appeare by his conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein he taketh vpon him to expound the other place of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> which you haue heard cyted by the Cardinall, to wit, <hi>Iniuria est &amp;c. It is iniury to pray for a Martyr, to whose prayers we ought to be recommended:</hi> whereto <hi>M.

Wherefore, that <hi>we should be recomended to the prayers of Martyrs, is not to inuocate them; but to wish to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the intercession of Christ the head, and of all his mysticall body, and we do call vpon Christ, that he may heare vs, and not vpon the Saynts that they may
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:2416:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heare vs, but this we craue of God, that they may be heard for vs of him, and with him.</hi> Thus doth <hi>M. Andrews</hi> glosse that text.</p>
            <p n="60">60. So as to be recommended to the prayer of a Martyr, is to wish to be recommended to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of all his mistycall body; as if a man should say, that for a man to be recommended to the prayers of <hi>M. Andrews,</hi> is not to craue the help of his prayers in particuler, but to wish that the Kings Maiesty (being head of the English Church) and all English Protestants, may pray for him. For truly he may say the one as well as the other, especially seeing that he giueth no reason at all of this his extrauagant interpretation, but relyeth wholy vpon his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse, and false vnderstanding of the other place of <hi>S.

            <p n="61">61. But to put the matter out of doubt what <hi>S.

               </q> Thus sayth S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> teaching expressely not only prayer to Saynts, but also prayer for the dead (which I wish <hi>M.

            <p n="7">7. Whereupon it must needs follow that seeing the Angels do not only know our actions much better then men, and heare our prayers no lesse then they, but also do continually assist vs as well with their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as otherwyse; it followeth, I say, that we may lawfully craue their assistance, yea much more then of men, for that they being ordayned by God to help vs, are no lesse willing, and farre more potent, and able to do it then men are; and therefore truly I may well conclude, that neyther the Councell of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> nor yet <hi>Theodoret</hi> could be so absurd as <hi>M.

            <head>THE CONCLVSION OF THIS ADIOYNDER, DEVIDED INTO TWO CHAPTERS. IN THIS, are detected diuers fraudes and shifts common to <hi>M. Andrews</hi> with <hi>M. Barlow</hi>; as to change the state of the question, to dissemble that which most importeth in the Cardinalls text and arguments; to abuse, wrest, bely and falsefy not only the Cardinall, but also the ancient Fathers, Councells, and holy Scriptures: and finally to face out matters impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly for lack of proofs.</head>

               </note> For he will needs haue workes of <hi>Supererogation</hi> to be such good works only as are done after or besids the full accomplishment of the Commandment (so that before a man can do a <hi>worke of supererogation,</hi> he must fullfill and fully obserue all the precepts) whereupon he also inferreth, that no man can do any such works, no not

These are those works which are laied out more for the wounded man, who through the compassion of the Samaritan was brought to the Inne to be cured, and therefore they are said not to be commanded by our Lord, although they are aduised to be offered, to the end, that they may be vnderstood to be so much more grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, by how much more they are signifyed not to be due.</hi> So he.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Also in another place he putteth the matter out of all doubt exemplyfying the same thus: <hi>Stbularius er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go est Apostolus.</hi>

               <hi>Quod autem supererogat &amp;c. Therefore the host is the Apostle, And that which he layeth out more, is eyther that counsell whereof he saith, De Virginibus praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

Domini non habeo, consilium autem do: Concerning virgines I haue no precept of our Lord, but I giue counsell. Or ells it is, that he wrought with his owne handes, least in the begining of the Ghospell he should be a burden to some of the weaker sort, when neuertheles it was lawfull for him to be fed or maintayned by the Ghospell.</hi> Thus sayth <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> clearly confuting <hi>M. Andrews</hi> his idle discourse; for to omit that he teacheth the vse of the word <hi>supere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation</hi> (which therefore was not deuised of late tyme and much lesse by the Catholiks of these dayes) first he sheweth that it signifieth such works, as being lawfull them selues are not comaunded by any precept, in which only sense Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and all other Catholyks vse it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Secondly he exemplifieth the same not only in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sell of <hi>Virginity</hi> (which is therfore a work of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi>) but also in <hi>S.

Andrews</hi> argueth very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently in saying, that the Apostles themselues could do no workes of <hi>Supererogation,</hi> because they had daily occasion to say, <hi>Dimitte nobis debita nostra.</hi> For I am sure <hi>M. Andrews</hi> will not deny that <hi>S. Paul</hi> was an Apostle, and yet <hi>S. Augustine</hi> affirmeth, as you see, that he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught works of <hi>Supererogatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> (namely <hi>Virginity,</hi> and continent single lyfe) but also practised &amp; performed them himselfe, doing such good workes as he was not bound to do by any precept. Besides that, it appeareth also hereby that a man may doe a work of <hi>Supererogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> though he haue occasion dayly to say <hi>Dimitte nobis debita nostra.</hi> Which therefore was an idle exception of <hi>M.

            <p n="24">24. To which purpose two things are to be noted in this matter, the one, that whereas <hi>Vigilantius</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Catholicks to <hi>adore</hi> and kisse euery where the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="379" facs="tcp:2416:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>
also by inclyning or bowing downe the body, which the word <hi>adoration</hi> signifieth, and <hi>S. Hierome</hi> denyeth not, though he denyeth the inference of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that <hi>Vigilantius</hi> made thereon.</p>
            <p n="25">25. The other is, that as <hi>Vigilantius</hi> did not herein reproue the particuler custome of some particuler men, but the practice of the whole Church at that tyme; so also <hi>S.

And the third followeth directly of the former, to wit, that the only mercie and liberality of God is not to haue place in his last Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as it should haue if <hi>Caluins</hi> doctrine were true) but also his Iustice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For I appeale to any indifferent man whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any such thing, as heere maliciously he inferreth, can be iustly gathered on the Cardinalls wordes, who (as I haue said before) meaning to confute <hi>Caluins</hi> pernicious doctrine (which draweth men to a most dangerous presumption of Gods mercy and neglect of his iustice, yea and to a careles contempt of all good workes, teaching all to be sinfull and damnable, and no other meanes of saluation but by only faith, and the imputation of Christs Iustice;) the Cardinall, I say, impugning this as well by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse Scripture, as by the Article of the Creed, doth vrge the Iustice of our iust Iudge, as well in the reward of vertue, and good workes, as in the punishment of vice &amp; sinne, not excluding his mercy from his Iustice (which can neuer be separated) but inculcating the consideration of his exact Iudgment in the examination, punishment, and reward of mens deedes, good and bad, according to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which directly ouerthroweth <hi>Caluins</hi> doctrine of iustification by only fayth, and of the impurity of good workes.</p>

Andrews</hi> knew very well that he could not so easily delude his Reader with the flourish of his false glosse, if he should lay downe the doctrine, and words of <hi>Caluin</hi> (which the Cardinall alledgeth and confuteth) he resolued to leaue them quite out with a great parte also of the Cardinalls text concerning the same. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he would haue his Reader to imagine that he lackt <hi>place and paper</hi> but if you consider the length of his discourse (which he continueth for almost three whole pages) you will easily see that he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth neyther paper nor roome in his margent to set downe all the Cardinalls text, if he had thought it would haue bene for his purpose.</p>
            <p n="52">52. But truely, that which seemeth to me most strange in his extrauagant discourse, is, how he could imagine that the Cardinall taketh vpon him to be iudge of his owne actions, whose arguments tend to proue, that God only is to examine and iudg all mens workes, and not that euery man, or yet any man shall be able to iudg and determine of the quality of his owne deedes; for so should man be his owne Iudg, &amp; the iugdement of God be no lesse superfluous &amp; needles, then it should be if <hi>Caluins</hi> doctrin (which the <hi>Cardinall</hi> impugneth) were true. Besides, that the Cardinall neyther saith, nor so much as insinuateth, that we shall haue no need in iudgement <hi>of the mercy of a Father, or the liberalitie of a Prince,</hi> and much lesse that he renounceth <hi>the mercy, grace, faith, and the Righteousnes of Christ</hi> (as <hi>M.

            <p n="7">7. For albeit it should be true, that the Arch-Bishop, and 3. others consecrated <hi>M.

Yf you had byn consecrated after the forme, and order which hath euer byn vsed, yee might haue had Bishops out of France to haue consecrated you, in case there had lacked in England.

<pb n="491" facs="tcp:2416:265"/>
to consecrate you, which is an euident signe that you sought not such a consecration, as had byn euer vsed, but such a one, whereof all the former Bishops were asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi> Thus saith <hi>D. Harding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Now then, <hi>good Reader,</hi> I wish heere certaine thinges to be considered, first, that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersy betwixt <hi>D.

            <p n="9">9. Secondly I wish it well to be weyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed, whether it be probable, that these two lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men (Doctor <hi>Harding,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Stapleton</hi>) would haue obiected to M. <hi>Iewell,</hi> and M. <hi>Horne,</hi> this defect of their consecration in printed bookes, so confidently, and resolutely, as they did, if they had not bin well assured of it, especially the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their consecration would haue byn so fresh in memory (if they had byn consecrated at all) that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyers of it might haue byn conuinced by multitudes of witnesses to their perpetuall shame.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Touching M.

               <note place="margin">How much it impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops to haue had a publick &amp; most solemne Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.</note> &amp; therfore for that point he boldly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to D. <hi>Hardings</hi> owne knowledg.
