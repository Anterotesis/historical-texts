            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>1. Looke to the cause and ground of thy sufferings, els all is naught, if that be not good, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>2. Thou must have a calling to suffer and not to thrust thy selfe into it without a calling.</p>
            <p>3. Thou must have a cleare conscience lying in no knowne sinne, or else thy suffering may be as <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> just upon thee for thy hypocrisie.</p>
            <p>4. Thou must have an upright heart in it.</p>
            <p>5. Thou maist not aime at by ends to please thy selfe.</p>
            <p>6. Thou must waite for GODS time of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, he that believes makes not haste to get out by ill meanes; if thou be thus qualified in thy sufferings the 37. <hi>Psal.</hi> will afford variety of precious comfort for thee, and terrible judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against thy Persecutours. Also observe these.</p>
            <p>1. These persecuting <hi>Belials</hi> shall (will they or nill they) glorifie GOD either in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, or confusion. And the day is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the meane time to cleare thy innocency and to discover their malice: The Divell and thine enemies be chained, they can goe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they have leave from GOD. GOD is about some extraordinary work, that he is thus fitting thee for it.</p>
            <p>2. If GOD turne them not on our parts there is most cause we should pitty them, and not envy
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23037:12"/>
at their estate: Who would have envied at <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah,</hi> when he was persecuting the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and presently after himselfe and all with him cast away: What became of him? and what befals one may be fall all.</p>
            <p>3. If thou desirest revenge on any in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test manner, it is to have them thrive in ill, and especially in persecuting the good, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. 18. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>4. When the wicked insult the whole Church is stirred up against them, <hi>Mala.</hi> 3. 13, 16.</p>
            <p>5. These insulting Enemies are but as the Wine-presses to wring out the sweet juyce of Patience and Prayer out of Christians, they are but as the Shepheards dogg to keep the sheep out of the severalls, and from unwholsome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and therfore know the time shall come that you shall blesse GOD for them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that you could not have bin without your sufferings under them.</p>
            <p>6. The very Persons of the sufferers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves do teach much sweetnesse and comfort to others by their gratious carriage, and also from the nature of affliction it selfe.</p>
            <p>1. The generall end of all affliction is to make grace shine, or purifie the soule.</p>
            <p>2. GOD will glorifie himselfe in the preservation of his, as of the three Children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>3. Afflictions will quicken and heat the heart; wheras many Christians are cold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:23037:13"/>4. That it may appeare, as unto <hi>Iob,</hi> that Christians serve not GOD mercenarily.</p>
            <p>5. That they may not be overvalued by others, some oppose them and get ability for a time to prevaile.</p>
            <p>6. That weak Christians might not be dejected when they are troubled.</p>
            <p>7. That it may appeare felicity rests not in these outward things, which <hi>Salomon</hi> calls <hi>vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> empty clouds, nay <hi>vexation of spirit,</hi> bringing torment unexpected.</p>
            <p>8. That the vertues of Christians may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in, and shine aboundantly in thee. Thus every way a good sufferer may receive comfort in the depth of his misery, and support his heart against all dejections and discouragements.</p>

For when sin stirs and looks grisly in their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it terrifies them; when as on the other side, wicked men care for none; no marvell than if they fleare in the face, when a godly man looks heavily.</p>

bad; but not a Divell in Hell, but would do a Christian mischiefe, and the LORD some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to punish some of his sins suffers Satan to afflict him.</p>
            <p>All worldlings are kind one to another, but of<note place="margin">Reason 3.</note> a world of good-fellows, not one of them is kind to a Christian, but would do him a displeasure if he could.</p>
            <p>GOD deales with his children as with the<note place="margin">Reason 4.</note> blind man, that had not that punishment for the sin of his Parents or himselfe, but that GOD may have glory.</p>
            <p>2. For Christians tryall, as <hi>Iob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Sometime in Judgement to harden the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, whom they could not win by their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they must now be hardened by their punishment.</p>
            <p>He that refraines from evill makes himselfe a<note place="margin">Reason 5.</note> prey to wicked men, Satan and his cunning world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, when he that refraines not is contrary.</p>
            <p>Many afflictions are proper to GODS chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">Reason 6.</note> as temptations, doubting of Salvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay sometimes hideous suggestions, as were to CHRIST, that no Christian is in that height, for the Son of GOD to be tempted to <hi>throw himselfe from the pinacle of the Temple:</hi> Nay he that thought it not robbery to be equall with GOD, to be <hi>tempted to worship the Divell,</hi> was more then ever any Christian had.</p>

as they can get: As <hi>Phareah</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> when the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were there the <hi>Iewes</hi> were but slaves unto them, and this represented the naturall estate of man.</p>
            <p>2. The bringing out of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Aegypt</hi> was followed with a long being in the Wildernesse, which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies their gracious state; in which they had many troubles and wants, and after many ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours came to <hi>Canaan</hi> a type of Heaven: So till they were there the best was a wildernes or <hi>vale of teares,</hi> because of their severall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
            <p>To Comfort those that be full of troubles;<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> when they see one affliction upon the neck of another, to conclude, they be sons, not ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards, pure gold, not rubbish.</p>
            <p>Let all Christians prepare for new suffrings;<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> for till death set us free, we are not to look to be free from troubles, and never more need to be prepared than now, when not only the Church beyond the Seas, but many good men be in great troubles, observe therfore these helps to take away the sting.</p>
            <p>1. Get <hi>Patience,</hi> the naturall weapon to help against all troubles, whither of GOD, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, or men. <hi>Iob</hi> by <hi>Patience</hi> bore all his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the tithe of which troubles would have made a carnall man hang himselfe, as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> had no comfort in wife or children, or outward honour, because he could not with <hi>Patience</hi> look upon <hi>Mordecai</hi> who a little cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him. A small crosse will robbe a man
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23037:14"/>
that wants <hi>Patience</hi> of the comfort of all other outward things; let therfore all Christians labour for <hi>Patience,</hi> and exercise it as Faith, or love, or any other grace, for I know not whither Christians so much scandalize Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by any thing, as by impatience, when there is any opposition, especially for <hi>meum &amp; tuum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Get your hearts to Heaven, for earthly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dednesse undoes all.</p>
            <p>3. Get <hi>spirituall Ioy,</hi> which makes us stand as firme as <hi>mount Sion,</hi> it will heat the heart and give us right to other delights: As the heat of the garment comes from the heart, for the heart heats the body, the body the cloathes and a little reflects again, so all comforts we have come from <hi>spirituall Ioy:</hi> for carnall joy alway makes the heart melancholy after, Whereas <hi>spirituall Ioy</hi> eates out the heart of worldly sorrow: Follow that therfore with eagernes and observe the differences thus; O death how bitter is thy remembrance to those that live in ease, in worldly prosperity and carnall joy, but it is contrary to those that live in <hi>spirituall Ioy,</hi> they had rather some of them have death than sleep when they are weary. Let a Christian tell me (for he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his state was once as the naturall mans, and he laboured for joy, but found it mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) now after he is gone on in a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an course some few yeares, and seeth his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and prizeth CHRIST before all
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23037:15"/>
things and allowes no wickednes in his heart, but hath taken the yoake and will weare it for ever, then tell me what joy hath ceazed on his heart when he hath CHRIST, from hence will spring as much joy as the heart will hold and more: If a poore man that lived in want a long time, had many thousands befalne him by the death of some great man, with what joy would he imbrace it? So when a scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched heart with sight and sence of sinne takes CHRIST and hath Heaven and Earth, and takes possession of the blessed Word and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, as farre then as Heaven surpasseth the Earth and both these that mans estate; so this joy doth outgo the other; therfore with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle I bid such a man rejoyce evermore, showte for joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> would have a Christians joy to be like the Sea, into which if a sparke fall, it cannot dry up all the moisture of the water, but is presently extinct: So should the joy of a Christian extinguish all afflictions; and great reason, doth not CHRIST promise that what we loose here for him, we shall have an hundred fold? What ever it be, GOD is All-sufficient and can give the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of it to his, that we may have an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fold of the comfort of these things here, and happinesse hereafter: Labour than for this <hi>spirituall Ioy</hi> in having CHRIST, this will comfort in all the troubles that befall any, though they be like the troubles of the Church beyond the Sea, that men have all things taken from
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23037:15"/>
them, wives and children slaine, or men bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with them out of the Land, yet none can take CHRIST from us, he is our portion for ever: la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour therfore for him.</p>
            <p>Is it so that the Church of GOD is in many<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> troubles? the Spirit of GOD sees it needfull to give Antidotes against trouble for her.</p>
            <p>Then this serves to trouble those that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver troubled, their state is woefull, it argues they be bastards: Let none then blesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that they were never troubled in mind, for I say if any man hath not beene troubled in mind for his sin, nor be not hereafter troubled for sin to drive him from all sin, he shall be sure to suffer everlastingly for it: I pray you let this sinke into your hearts, and when any is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled say not: O these be the Hypocrites that will grow mad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But let no such word come from any but incarnate Divels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Why, J have severall crosses and losses in my estate, weakenesse and sickenesse of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore my spirituall estate is good and happy?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There are three things observable in affliction; for affliction here ment is,</p>
            <p>First, Sanctified Affliction to cause us to grow in the whole body of Sanctification and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in sin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If thou allowest any sin these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions be the beginning of Hell torments, as Christians spirituall joy argues the beginning of their joyes of Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:23037:16"/>Thirdly, All things fall alike to all outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both the godly and the wicked may have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, they worke in the one contrary to the other, in the one they work brokennesse of heart and humility, in the other contrary: they are fore-runners of hell to the one, of Heaven to the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But J have no such troubles here, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore J am no Christian?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It may be thou art troubled that thou wantest trouble. Is not the sence of the want of troubles now a trouble unto thee? but if thou hast none inward, thou hast some outward, art thou not smitten with the ill tongues of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked? Though a Christian may goe so farre (though very rare) as not to have ill tongues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, yet a Christian hath cause then to be troubled for that, and suspect himselfe (though he may be in good estate) when ill tongues are not against him; for men may have the good word of ill men about them, because of their faults, as</p>
            <p>1. When they give too much liberty to their licentiousnesse.</p>
            <p>2. Not to reproove them when they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to it.</p>
            <p>3. When they are spirituall cowards, and dare not shew themselves for God.</p>
            <p>4. When they desire the good word of all; because they thinke else, such fellowes will raile on them; these be base cowards, if not stark naught: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

said) what have I done that such wicked men speake well of me: Saint <hi>Austin</hi> said, I will by no meanes be commended by a man that lives ill, it is a corrasive to my heart, I cannot abide it. When a man first riseth to goodnesse, his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward virtue like the Sunne rising casteth a great shadow; so is there much opposition to it at the first: But when the Sunne hath come to his height, then but a little shadow: so the height of grace and virtue may cause little or no opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this may be by accident, by helpes of good outward parts, and faire and courteous carriages, not grace and goodnesse, for this will draw hatred from every wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man.</p>
