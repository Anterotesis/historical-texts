            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To my deerly beloved friends which are in Chriſt Jeſus, Grace, Mercy, &amp; Peace from God the Father and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</head>
            <p>THat which at this time moved me to preſent you with this enſuing Diſcourſe, is that heavenly and glorious ſhape and form, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the great Red Dragon is now come forth in the Spirits of Profeſſors; never was the Dragon in more glorious habit
<pb facs="tcp:169841:3"/>
then now: O how he is array<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how his mouth is ful fraught with pretended immediate and perfect enjoyments of God in the Spirit, under colour of which he ſeeks to deceive, and by his taile to draw thoſe down, out of heaven into the earth, that have ſhined as ſtars in heaven: he is great, and he is red, that is to ſay, he is mighty and he is bloody; His mightineſs and bloodyneſs lye hid under his glorious appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances; He is called in Scripture that old Serpent, whoſe tail is full of windings and turnings, who was of old in the begining, Gen. 3. He is called likewiſe the Devil and Sathan, a Deceiver and
<pb facs="tcp:169841:3"/>
an Adverſary; he is all theſe names under beautiful Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and appearances of God; he is wrapped up and covered in and under Doctrines, Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Writings of men and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries of God, he uſhereth in Errors with glorious truths. In his appearing to Profeſſors he looks firſt how their Natures are inclined, he caſteth an eye firſt at the bent of their Spirits, That way which they are inclined he wil ſute himſelf in apparell, if they be inclined towards Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Fictions, Forms, or preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded high injoyments of God without power, he ſutes himſelf accordingly; he makes uſe of
<pb facs="tcp:169841:4"/>
Scripture likewiſe to ſtrengthen him in his Deſigns. Theſe and many others are his ſubtilties now adayes: this Dragon is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to be a wonder in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Revel. 12. becauſe of his ſeven heads and ten horns, and ſeven crowns upon his heads: a wonder indeed you wil ſay it is, when you come to be taken up with John into the Spirit: The Dragon wants no wiſdome to tempt, deceive, and devour, for he hath ſeven heads; no power to bring about his deſigns, for he hath ten horns; and he wants no glory wherewith to promiſe to profeſſors, if they will fall down and worſhip him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:169841:4"/>
he hath ſeven Crowns.</p>
            <p>Beloved Friends, therefore I have written this enſuing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe likewiſe, to ſhew you the multiplicity of ſubtilty, power, and glory, that is in him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and which I have ſeen to be in him; Do not therefore, O do not ſlight what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, though confuſed and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; it is the day of ſmal things which God would not have you deſpiſe, conſider well what I have written, before you begin to cenſure it: and if you finde any truth in what I write, mind that more then he that writ it. If you inquire whoſe this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is, it is the diſcourſe of a
<pb facs="tcp:169841:5"/>
bruiſed Reed, and of ſmoaking flax, of a ſuckling, of a babe in Chriſt, out of whoſe mouth God will perfect his praiſe.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the beginning of this Chapter, There is a great wonder ſpoken of which appeared to <hi>John,</hi> and which he ſaw, (a door being opened in heaven to him.) The wonder is as followeth, <hi>A woman clothed with the Sun, and the Moon under her feet, and upon her head a Crown of twelve ſtars,</hi> This woman is the Church of Chriſt, his Spouſe, the Lambs bride, as appears by many
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:169841:6"/>
places of Scripture, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 32. <hi>Revel,</hi> 31. 9. The Sun wherewith ſhe is cloathed, is that light and glory which ſhines forth in the Goſpel, which is Chriſt the Son of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for ſo he is called in <hi>Malac.</hi> 4. 2. but unto you that fear my Name ſhall the Sun of Righteouſneſs appear with healing in his wings. The Moon is a light below the Sun, and borroweth its light from the Sun; and is nothing but that light and glory which ſhined and doth now ſhine forth in the Law: The terme <hi>under her feet,</hi> is nothing elſe but beneath her; the Crown of twelve ſtars which is upon her head, holds forth that Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and Kingly glory wherewith the Church of Chriſt is cloathed, ſo that the meaning of the wonder is this, It holds forth that multiplicity of glory which the Church of Chriſt is in and under, for there is a glory of the Sun, a glory of the Moon, and a glory of the ſtars; a crown of twelve ſtars above her, the Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in the midſt of her, and the Moon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her feet; ſo that there is glory above her, glory in the midſt of her, and glory beneath her, inſomuch that ſhe is hem'd in with glory; or it holds forth that variety of glory under which the Church is, <hi>for there is one glory of the Sun, another of the Moon, &amp; another of</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:169841:6"/>
               <hi>the ſtars, for one star differeth from another in glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 41. This woman ſo cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with glory being with child, and cryed travelling in birth and pain to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there appears preſently another wonder in heaven, which is that which I intend now to ſpeak to:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And there appeared another wonder in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and behold a great red Dragon, having ſeven heads and ten horns, and ſeven Crowns upon his heads, &amp;c.</hi> The words are one of the Wonders which <hi>John</hi> ſaw, being taken up by the Spirit into heaven, there being a door opened to him: It is ſaid, in heaven it appeared to him, from whence we may draw this concluſion, That there is no ſeeing of a Wonder but in heaven, &amp; there is no ſeeing of heaven without being taken up by the Spirit into it, unleſs a door be opened in heaven to us; If we have a deſire (friends) to ſee a Wonder, we muſt deſire God to take us up into heaven, and there to open the door of heaven to us, for ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> was taken up into heaven, ſee <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 10. and there a door was opened to him, ſee <hi>Revel.</hi> 4. 1. This Wonder is a Wonder indeed; What, That a great Red Dragon ſhould be ſeen in heaven: Stand aſtoniſhed and be amazed, ô ye heavens!
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169841:7"/>
was there ever ſuch a thing heard of! If you could but ſee it you would ſtand aſtoniſhed and admire! But to come neerer to the words, <hi>Behold,</hi> it is a word of Speculation; See, take notice of, what, <hi>a great Red Dragon,</hi> where may you ſay, <hi>in heaven:</hi> O Wonderfull! this is a ſtrange thing indeed, how can this be? To make it plain, we ſhall enquire what this word <hi>Wonder</hi> is, it is ſomewhat ſeen which cauſeth admiration; It ſignifies a ſign; what this Wonder or ſign is, It is <hi>a great Red Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon in heaven, having ſeven heads and ten horns, and ſeven Crowns upon his heads:</hi> But you will aske me, what is this great Red Dragon in heaven? I ſhall ſhew you what it is by and by, but firſt we ſhall enquire into,</p>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>The firſt thing to be enquired into is, what heaven is, in which this great red Dragon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared: Heaven is taken variouſly in Scripture, ſometimes it is taken for the materiall heaven, the Firmament, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 8. Sometimes it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for things that are or may be ſhaken; <hi>yet once more I ſhake not only earth but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf;</hi> and this word <hi>yet once more,</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the removing of thoſe things that are ſhaken, as of things that are made, that thoſe things which cannot be ſhaken may remain, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 26, 27. Now thoſe things that are or may be ſhaken are Propheſies, Tongues, and Knowledge, ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. But heaven in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:169841:8"/>
this place is taken for the glory and light of God, which <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw when he was praying.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be inquired into, is, what the appearing of the great Red Dragon in heaven, is:</p>
            <p>It is this, there was ſeen a great Red Dragon in heaven by <hi>John,</hi> it was ſuch an appearance as was accompanyed with ſeeing, ſo that <hi>Iohn</hi> could ſay, I ſaw it; and it was no lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he ſaw, but a true one: what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing it is for a man to declare nothing but what he hath ſeen; what hath appeared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to him, by a door being opened in heaven to him, as <hi>Iohn</hi> did, or by being taken up in the Spirit as he was.</p>
            <p>The third thing to be enquired into, is, Why it is called another Wonder; That is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Wonder going before, in the firſt verſe of this Chapter; <hi>And there appeared a great wonder in heaven, a woman cloathed with the Sun, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth thing to be enquired into, is, What this great Red Dragon or Wonder is; It is the old Serpent, called the Devill and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, which deceiveth the old world, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 2. <hi>And he laid hold on the Dragon, that old Serpent, which is the Devil</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:169841:8"/>
               <hi>and Sathan, and bound him a thouſand years;</hi> So that if any enquire what the great Red Dragon is that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw, It is the old Serpent called the Devill and Sathan: but what is the old Serpent the Devill and Sathan? He is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Devil and Sathan, and he is the Devil and Sathan. The Wonder is the Dragon in heaven, the Dragon is the old Serpent; the old Serpent is the Devil and Sathan: I pray mind it, for there are ſome now adayes that hold neither Dragon, old Serpent, Devill not Sathan; you ſee that there are ſuch, and that from Scripture (if you do not deny Scripture) and I my ſelf, by woful experience have found that there are ſuch.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But may ſome ſay, What is the cauſe why the Dragon is the old Serpent, and the Serpent is called the Devill and Sathan.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Dragon is the old Serpent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Serpent was from the begining; he it was that craftily and ſubtilly inſinuated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and prevailed with them for to eate that, the fruit whereof was death: and he is called the Serpent becauſe of his ſubtiltie, and becauſe of thoſe windings and turnings that are in him, as I ſhal ſhew here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: and the Serpent is called the Devill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his accuſing the Saints day and night
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169841:9"/>
before God; for the word devill ſignifies an Accuſer: and he is called Sathan becauſe of that averſneſs that is in him againſt the Saints, for Sathan ſignifies an Adverſary: the Serpent, Devill and Sathan are nothing but the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon multiplyed, the Dragon come forth into variety, the Dragon made known under three denominations; for as I ſaid before, the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon is the Serpent, and the Serpent is called the Devill, and Sathan, and he is the Devil and Sathan.</p>
            <p>The fifth thing to be enquired into, is, what thoſe Epethites are, which are given to the great Red Dragon, they are two:</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, he is Great.</item>
               <item>Secondly, he is Red.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, he is Great; that is, he is a hughe Dragon, very large and big, his greatneſs doth many times affright a Saint; it was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle one that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw, but a great one, ſuch a one as did beget admiration: a Saints adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary is a great Devil, a mighty one, not a ſmall one; that is the reaſon many times that Saints are faint to take to themſelves <hi>the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> of God, to withſtand ſtrong and great <hi>Goliah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, He is Red, That is another Epe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thite which is given to the Dragon; as great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169841:9"/>
holds forth bigneſs and mightineſs, ſo redneſs betokens bloudineſs, cruelty: O! he is a bloudy and cruel Dragon; no leſs than the bloud of Saints will content him: If he can but draw bloud of a Saint, he is ſatisfied: Saints, ſee what an enemy you have to wreſtle with; but let not his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and bloudineſs affright you, for he is a chained Dragon. <hi>Jude</hi> v. 6.</p>
            <p>The ſixt thing to be enquired into, is, the place where he is, that is in Heaven: <hi>John</hi> ſaw this wonder in Heaven. Heaven, as I ſaid before, was the glory of God; It is not a local place, which ſome fancie to be in the Firmament; neither conſiſteth it in meats and drinks, but <hi>in Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy.</hi> Rom. 14. 17.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh thing to be enquired into is, what the great red Dragons ſeven heads are: Seven you know is a perfect number; and the head holds forth Wiſdom, Policy, and Craftineſs; for in the head are all theſe: We uſe to ſay, ſuch a one hath a wiſe, crafty, politique head: So that the meaning is this, That there is a perfection of Wiſdom, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Craftineſs in the great red Dragon, to tempt, deceive, devour, and the like. O friends, look about you; he hath not only a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169841:10"/>
politique crafty head, for to tempt, deceive, devour, and the like; but he hath a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heads, and they are full of policy and craftineſs; which policy and craftineſs, he makes uſe of againſt the Saints, to perplex and rouble them on every ſide, night and day.</p>
            <p>The eighth thing to be enquired into is, what thoſe ten Horns of the great red Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon are: His Horns hold forth his power and ſtrength: We uſe to ſay, there is ſtrength in Horns; The number ten being joyn'd to them, it holds forth this, That multiplicity of ſtrength and power that is in the great red Dragon to bring about his Deſigns: He hath not only Wiſdom, Policy, and Crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in him for the acting of his Deſigns, but he hath a multiplicity of ſtrength and power likewiſe to bring about his Deſigns: If a man had never ſo much wiſdom and policy to act his Deſigns yet if he wanted ſtrength, his wiſdom and policy would ſtand him in little ſteed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wiſdom without ſtrength avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth little: But the Dragon hath both, and a multiplicity of both, as I ſaid before, and therefore O Saints beware of him.</p>
            <p>The ninth thing to be enquired into is, What the ſeven Crowns upon the great red
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169841:10"/>
Dragons head are: Seven (as I ſaid before) is a perfect number; Crowns hold forth this to us, Dignity, Rule, and Royalty; So that the meaning of it is this, There is a perfection of Dignity, Rule, and Royalty, wherewith the Dragon is inveſted; His Crowns upon his heads, ſpeak him to be a perfect King and Ruler; he delights to be King, and to reigne in the whole world; but eſpecially in Saints; he would fain be King there, he would fain wear the Crown in a Saint: O that Saints would therefore take heed of him, and not ſuffer him to uſe his ſcepter in their hearts; but let Jeſus Chriſt uſe his ſcepter, whoſe right it is.</p>
            <p>The tenth thing to be enquired into is, what the tail of the great red Dragon is: It is thoſe windings and turnings that are in the great red Dragon: The tail of the Dragon it turns this way, and that way, and if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevail, it will turn every way; ſee how the tail of the great red Dragon ſeveral waies winded and turned towards Jeſus Chriſt, when he <hi>was had by the Spirit into the Wilderneſs to be tempted,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Firſt, the <hi>Tempter</hi> came to Chriſt, and ſaid; <hi>If thou be the Son of God, command theſe ſtones to be</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:169841:11"/>
               <hi>made Bread:</hi> Here the Divel would make Chriſt queſtion his Son-ſhip; Jeſus Chriſt he had heard a voice from the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent glory, that he was Gods beloved Son; now the Divel he endeavours to make Chriſt queſtion that he was Gods Son; he ſaith unto him, <hi>If thou beeſt the Son of God, turn theſe ſtones into Bread;</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Thou a Son of God, and cannot turn theſe ſtones into Bread? A Son of God can do it; it beſpeaks thee not to be a Son of God, if thou doſt not turn theſe ſtones into Bread; He endeavours to make him queſtion his Son-ſhip from his not turning ſtones into bread: juſt ſo he deals with a poor ſoul, Thou a ſon of God and not do this; that is to ſay, ſubdue corruption, and withſtand ſin? When the Divel hath gotten a poor ſoul into the wilderneſs, as he did Chriſt, ſo that the poor ſoul is ready to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vniſh for bread from heaven, then the Divel ſaith unto him, to make him queſtion his ſon-ſhip, If thou be a ſon of God, relieve thy ſelf, ſuccour thy ſelf, for a ſon of God can turn ſtones into bread: But Chriſt ſaid unto him, <hi>It is written;</hi> What is written? This; <hi>That man ſhall not live by Bread alone, but by every Word that proceeds out of the mouth</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:169841:11"/>
               <hi>of God.</hi> When the Divel could not prevail this way, ſee how his tail winds another way; <hi>Then the Divel takes him up into the holy City, and ſetteth him on a Pinacle of the Temple, and ſaith unto him; If thou be the Son of God, caſt thy ſelf down; for it is written, He ſhall give his Angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they ſhall bear thee up, leſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone.</hi> Here he tempts him to deſtroy himſelf, moving this to Chriſt as an Argument to do it; that is to ſay, if thou beeſt the Son of God, thou may'ſt caſt thy ſelf down, thou needeſt not fear; for he ſhall give his Angels charge over his Son, and they ſhall bear thee up in their hands, they ſhall hold thee up, leſt thou daſh thy foot againſt a ſtone: As if he ſhould have ſaid, Thou needeſt not fear doing of it, God hath given a charge to Angels to keep thee from hurt; ſo that if thou doſt it, Angels will bear thee up and keep thee; they have a charge to do it, and they muſt perform that to God: juſt ſo the Divel ſets upon poor ſouls, when he tempts them to make away themſelves; O (ſaith Satan) thou may'ſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thy ſelf, Angels will bear thee up and keep thee, leſt any hurt befal thee; thou
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169841:12"/>
mayeſt do this, and that, for thou art under the protection of Angels: This Satan tempts them to when poor ſouls are in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that is in a bewildred condition; But Chriſt ſaid unto him, <hi>It is written again, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> When the Divel could not prevail this way, ſee how the Dragon winds his tail another way: <hi>Again, the Divel takes him up into an exceeding high Mountain, and ſheweth him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the glory of them; and ſaith unto him, All theſe things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> Here the Divel ſets Jeſus Chriſt on high, and ſheweth him all the glory of the world, promiſing Chriſt it all, if he would be a worſhipper of him: As if he ſhould have ſaid, Do but turn a worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of me, thou ſhalt have all the glory of all the Kingdoms of this world: He ſeeks here to make Chriſt worſhip him, by ſhewing and promiſing him the worlds glory. Thus he ſeeks to prevail upon poor ſouls, to make them worſhippers of him, he preſents the glory of this world before them; as profit, credit, eſteem, honour, repute, and the like, and promiſeth them they ſhall have all of it, if they will worſhip him: How many poor
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169841:12"/>
ſouls have bin caught in this ſnare? But Jeſus ſaid unto Satan, <hi>Get thee hence Satan, for it is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God and him only ſhalt thou ſerve. Then the Divel leaves him</hi> &amp;c. So that you ſee what the tail of the great red Dragon is, that is to ſay thoſe windings and turnings that are in the great red Dragon; and how Jeſus Chriſt anſwereth the Divel in all theſe three temptations; which may teach us how to anſwer him when the Divel tempts us: for as the windings of his tail are againſt Jeſus Chriſt, ſo they are againſt us; He tempts us (as I ſaid before) ſomtimes to queſtion our ſon-ſhip and ſomtimes to deſtroy our ſelves; and ſomeimes to fall down and worſhip him, by his ſet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing before us the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the world; as he did before Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The eleventh thing to be enquired into, is, What the third part of the ſtars of Heaven are which by the tail of the great red Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon are drawn out of heaven, and caſt into the earth; The third part of the ſtars of heaven, are thoſe that are unſtable, infirm, unſetled, not built upon the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re foundation, that in appearance have ſhined like ſtars in heaven; they are not to be underſtood the material ſtars, but it is a Metaphorical kind
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169841:13"/>
of expreſſion, borrowed from the ſtars; they ſhined as the ſtars: As there hath bin ſome in our days, that have ſhined ſo in ſhew, but are now caſt down out of heaven into the earth, ſo that now their lights are put out, they themſelves are become earthly, worldly, carnal, and the like.</p>
            <p>The twelfth thing to be be enquired into is, What the earth is into which the great red Dragon caſteth the third part of the ſtars of heaven: The earth ſomtimes is put for the men of the earth; As, <hi>O earth hear the word of the Lord:</hi> ſometimes it is put for the material earth, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 20. but here it is to be taken for that which the firſt man is off; the firſt man is of the earth, earthly: ſo that it is taken for that earthly mindedneſs, worldlineſs, wickedneſs, wretchedneſs, and filthineſs which was in <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall.</p>
            <p>The thirteenth thing to be enquired into, is, What the meaning of the great red Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons ſtanding before the woman which was ready to be delivered is; ſtanding is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of readineſs to devour; ſo that it holds forth this, the readineſs that the Dragon is in to devour the man-child; and that term before her, that is, before the womans face,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169841:13"/>
facing of the woman; the womans readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be delivered, ſignifies her being nigh at hand to bring forth: Now what a ſad thing it would be for a woman to have one that ſeeks her life, and the life of her child, ſtand facing of her when ſhe is ready to bring forth; it will endanger both the woman and child: ſo it is here; O what a ſad thing it is to the Church of Chriſt, to have the great red Dragon ſtand facing of her when ſhe is ready to be delivered of Jeſus Chriſt; it is the only way to make the Church of Chriſt miſcarry. Thus you ſee that the meaning of the Dragons ſtanding before the woman holds forth, That there is a readineſs in the Dragon to devour the Babe, either by facing of the woman, and ſo making of her miſcarry by reaſon of fear, or by devouting of the Babe when he is born.</p>
            <p>The fourteenth thing to be enquired into is, what the meaning of that ſaying is, for <hi>to devour her child as ſoon as it was born.</hi> To devour is to eat up quite, to make an end of; as ſoon as it was born; that is, ſo ſoon as it was brought forth. So ſoon as ever the Saints of God are in a readineſs to bring forth Chriſt in them, the great red Dragon ſtands before their face for to devour him; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:169841:14"/>
endure Chriſt ſhould be in them, or brought forth in them, but ſeeks to deſtroy him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> juſt as <hi>Herod,</hi> and the Scribes and Phariſees after Chriſt was born did ſeek to devour Chriſt without us ſo the Dragon ſeeks to devour him within us and for this purpoſe ſhe ſtands before us and faceth us, that he might be the more ready to catch and lay hold of Chriſt and quaſh the appearing of him in us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> You know what a ſad thing it would be for a woman, to have her child as ſoon as it was brought forth ſnatcht from her, and devoured and eaten up before her face: O how it would trouble her! So for a ſoul to have Jeſus Chriſt ſo ſoon as he is brought forth in it ſnatcht from it, and devoured and eaten up before its face; O what a ſad caſe that ſoul will be in! O how it will cry out for is Jeſus is Jeſus; as the woman would for her child<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O my child, my child!</p>
            <p>The terms in the words being thus explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the firſt <hi>Theſis</hi> or <hi>Baſis</hi> upon which I ſhall build my diſcourſe, is this;</p>
            <q>That there is ſuch a thing as the great red Dragon in heaven.</q>
            <p>It is cleer from the words, and it is cleer from other Scriptures as that Scripture in <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 18. ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>I</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:169841:14"/>
               <hi>beheld Satan fall as lightning from heaven:</hi> he was in heaven, and Chriſt ſaw him fall from his ſeat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſtion.</hi> But you will ask me, <hi>What? Is Satan in heaven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To that I anſwer as followeth:</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, Satan in heaven, is Satan in a Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhape.</item>
               <item>Secondly, Satan in heaven, is Satan in a Prophetical ſhape.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, Satan in heaven, is Satan in a Kingly ſhape.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt of all, Satan in heaven, is Satan in a Prieſtly ſhape; appearing as the Prieſt Chriſt Jeſus, acting his Prieſthood, doing the very office and work of Chriſt as offering ſacrifice to God, putting up petitions to him, praying, and the like.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Satan in heaven, is Satan in a Prophetical ſhape; as the Prophet Chriſt, acting him as a Prophet, propheſie as he did, that is to ſay, ſpeak to edification, exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, reproof, and of things to come: O how Satan hath bin in heaven in ſome in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in our days! In what a Prophetical ſhape he hath appeared, who have propheſied out of their own hearts, who have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their own ſpirits, and have ſeen nothing but
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169841:15"/>
vanity and lying Divination; ſaying, <hi>The Lord ſaith, and the Lord hath not ſent them; and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word, and they have with their lyes made the heart of the righteous ſad, when God hath not made ſad:</hi> Ezek. 13. All which we cannot but ſee fulfilled in our days.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Satan in heaven, is Satan in a Kingly ſhape; acting the Kingly Office of Chriſt, reigning, ruling, and commanding, within the heart and without, as Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But to make things more plain, the Dragon in heaven, is the Dragon on high.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Dragon in glory.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Dragon at reſt. For heaven preſents us with all theſe three things, Height, Glory, and Reſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, The Dragon in heaven, is the Dragon on High; that is to ſay, in the Chair, Seat, and Temple of God, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf that he is God, and ſaying that he is God; 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 4. He it is <hi>that exalts himſelf as the Eagle, that ſets his neſt among the ſtars:</hi> Obad. 1. 4. He is that <hi>Lucifier that aſcends into heaven, and that exalts his Throne above the ſtars, that ſits upon the mount of the Congregation in the ſides of the</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:169841:15"/>
               <hi>North:</hi> Iſa. 14. 13. He is that <hi>Capernaum, which is exalted unto heaven, and which ſhall be brought down unto hell.</hi> Matth. 11. 23.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Dragon in heaven, is the Dragon in Glory; which is nothing elſe, but the Dragon in an Angel of Light: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8. And no marvel, for Satan himſelf is changed into an Angel of Light. And Satan was changed into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Light in thoſe falſe Apoſtles in this reſpect, in preaching another Jeſus, Spirit, and Goſpel, that was not preached, received, and accepted: and truly we may ſee the Dragon changed into an Angel of Light in our days, in this reſpect; There is another Jeſus preached, that was not preached; not that Jeſus which dyed at Jeruſalem, but one which is within us, ſay ſome; when as he that dyed at Jeruſalem, and he within us, is all one Jeſus; or another Jeſus, that is, they preach ſalvation by works; another Spirit, which is a Spirit of freedom to do any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wickedneſs; and another Goſpel, which is juſtification by Works; not that Goſpel which <hi>Paul</hi> preached; <hi>That Chriſt dyed at Jeruſalem for our ſins, according to the Scripture; and that he was buried, and</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:169841:16"/>
               <hi>that he roſe again:</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 3, 4. In which ſaying lies hid more glory than we dream of, and is more hard to be believed than many think it is.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Dragon in heaven, is the Dragon at reſt; for Heaven notes reſt: See <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. 7. <hi>She ſaith in her heart, I ſit a Queen, and am no Widdow, and ſhall ſee no ſorrow:</hi> She ſits a Queen; ſitting notes reſt; ſhe ſits a Queen, that is, as one in State and Honour; and no Widdow, that is, ſhe is in no Widdows ſtate, which is a ſorrowful ſtate; ſhe ſits a Queen, there is the great red Dragons being at reſt in her, which is the Dragons being in heaven.</p>
            <p>I ſhall further illuſtrate it by theſe four following things; that is to ſay,</p>
            <p>The Dragon in Heaven, is the Dragon in and under things that ſeem to ſavour of Piety, Zeal, Holineſs, and Righteouſneſs: The Dragon in Heaven, is the Dragon (I ſay) covered over with a ſeeming ſavour of Piety, Zeal, and Holineſs; He pretends much Piety, Zeal, and Holineſs in Profeſſors; much Prayer, much Faſting, much keeping of the Sabbath, much giving of Alms; as in the Scribes and Phariſees he did; When the <hi>Sons of God came to preſent themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:169841:16"/>
               <hi>God, He came with them:</hi> Job. 1. 6. which was to ſhew how religious he was: but under theſe his ſpecious ſhews lies ſubtilty, mingled with bloudyneſs and cruelty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Dragon in Heaven is the Dragon in Peace; for Heaven notes Peace: that is, at quiet with a Profeſſor, that he doth not diſturb nor moleſt him night nor day; ſo that the poor ſoul knows not what to do. Now the Dragon is then in Peace, when he ſees all is ſo in the ſoul as he would have it, he will never trouble that ſoul; but if it be not ſo in the ſoul as he would have it, (as it is not in Saints.) O then he is never at Peace and Quiet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but is always tempting and troubling it, ſo that the ſoul hath no quiet in its Spirit; the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon thinking thereby to bring about his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Dragon in Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the Dragon in joy; Now then, the Dragon is in joy (if I may ſo ſay) when by his tempting and troubling of a Saint, he hath gotten the beſt of him, then he rejoyceth; O how merry and joyful he would be indeed, if he could quite ruine a Saint; The Dragons joyfulneſs, lies in the Saints ſadneſs, trouble, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169841:17"/>
The more or leſs ſad, troubled, or overcome they are, the more or leſs is his joy.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The Dragon in Heaven, is the Dragon in a pretended, perfect, immediate, and high enjoyments of God in the Spirit, Allegorizing the Scripture, and ſo denying the letter thereof: Thoſe whoſe eys God hath opened, cannot but ſubſcribe to this, for this is to be ſeen now a days in Profeſſors: O how have they pretended perfect immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate enjoyments of God in the Spirit, under pretence whereof denying the Scripture; O how they have vaunted and ſaid, we enjoy God immediately, that is without the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: Alas what is the Scripture ſay they, how ſcornfully they have ſpoken of it, though it be <hi>profitable for Inſtruction, that the man of God be throughly perfect to ſalvation;</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Some there are that Allegorize the Scripture, and under pretence of that, make void the Letter: which allegorizing the Scripture, they call the ſpiritual interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Letter; when as the ſpiritual interpretation of the letter, is that interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the Spirit of God gives of the Letter; It is true, there are ſome things in Scripture which are to be taken otherwiſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169841:17"/>
then they are ſet down in the letter, that is, when they are allegorically, parabolically, and ſymbolically ſpoken: But they allegorize eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place of Scripture almoſt, which I know no warrant for, and ſo deny the letter: I will name but one place of Scripture, and that is in 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Every ſpirit that confeſſeth Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt come in the fleſh is of God;</hi> that is, come within us, ſay they: And ſo under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of this deny Jeſus Chriſt in manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the fleſh, and ſuffering at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo utterly overthrow what Chriſt hath done for us, and ſo they become the greateſt Antichriſts in the world. There are two ſorts of Profeſſors in the world that deny Jeſus Chriſt come in the fleſh.</p>
            <p>One ſort of Profeſſors are thoſe that alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether look at Jeſus Chriſt within them, and deny him without them; and theſe are thoſe that deny Jeſus Chriſt come in the fleſh, and ſo are the Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>There is a ſecond ſort of Profeſſors, that look at Jeſus Chriſt altogether without them, as one ſuffering at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and being rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, &amp;c. but never look at him as within them, they never find the Life, Power and Spirit of him within them; and ſo they are Antichriſt as well as the other: Now that Profeſſor
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:169841:18"/>
which acknowledgeth Chriſt come in the fleſh, and Chriſt come in his fleſh, and whoſe faith is fixed on Chriſt as one in the Heavens, and in every place, and as one that is in his heart, as well as he is in the Heavens and in every place, is not Antichriſt.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, that there is ſuch a thing as the great red Dragon in Heaven, then beg of God a ſight of him in Heaven, for you cannot ſee him till a door be opened in Heaven to you, as there was to <hi>John:</hi> He may ſtand at your right hand and left hand, and you ſee him not: Till you be taken up by the Spirit into Heaven, you cannot diſcern his <hi>ſeven heads, ten horns, and ſeven crowns;</hi> that is to ſay thoſe multiplicities of ſubtilties, policies and glory wherewith he deceives poor Souls; and till you know his tricks you cannot beware of them, but he will ſet upon you on every ſide, and you ſhall ſee it not; he will blind your eyes, that the light of the glorious Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt ſhall not ſhine into your Souls, he will have you one way or another, and if he cannot prevail one way, he wil another; he will endevor to catch you by the inclination of your mind and nature, he will watch which way they are carried, &amp; ſo ſet a trap for your ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If it be ſo, That there is ſuch a thing as the great red Dragon in Heaven, then
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169841:18"/>
Friends, take heed of him, for he ſtands at <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhuah</hi>'s right hand; he will appear in his white rayment to you, becauſe you are Saints; he will put on his moſt beautiful robes when he appears to Saints, thereby to deceive them: Take heed of his Heads, lamb-like Horns, and glorious Crowns, leſt by his ſubtilty, ſtrength and glory he fetch you down from your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions; and though he appear in never ſo much glory, ſtoop not at all, and do not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to him, O noble Saints, no not a jot, notwithſtanding his crowns of glory.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If it be ſo, That there is ſuch a thing as the great red Dragon in Heaven, having ſeven heads, ten horns, and ſeven crowns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his heads, be not afraid of him, let not his monſtrouſneſs trouble you, do not fear, leſt he ſhould by his policy and ſtrength ſet upon you; fear not his ſtrength nor policy, your God will ſtrengthen you with ſtrength in your Souls by the Spirit againſt him; never think that you ſhall not be able to deal or grapple with him, ſeeing God will make perfect his ſtrength in your weakneſſes: Do not cry out, O ſurely, ſurely I ſhall be overcome by his temptations; but rather fill your mouths as Chriſt did his againſt him, with <hi>It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, It is written, It is written,</hi> and bring no
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169841:19"/>
railing accuſation againſt him, as <hi>Moſes</hi> durſt not; but cry, <hi>The Lord, even the Lord that hath choſen Jeruſalem, rebuke him:</hi> then you ſhall ſee him go from you, and leave you, as he did Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If there be ſuch a thing as the great red Dragon in Heaven, and that this Dragon is the old Serpent, and the Serpent is the Devil and Satan; then this may ſerve to inform ſome that deny the Dragon, old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, Devil and Satan, that ſay there is none ſuch; I ſay, this may ſerve to inform them of the truth of it, that there are ſuch.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But may ſome ſay, If there be ſuch, from whence is the Dragons riſe? otherwiſe the Serpent, Devil and Satan. 2. What was his fall? And 3. where is this Dragon, otherwiſe the Serpent, Devil and Satan?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Without queſtion, his riſe with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angels was from God; but his not keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>his firſt ſtate, but falling away from it, was from himſelf, and in himſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What was his fall?</p>
            <p>It was this; He being at firſt a good and holy Angel himſelf, and partaking of the brightneſs of the angelical Glory, living and dwelling in the ſame with the reſt of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Angels, fell from his firſt eſtate or
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169841:19"/>
principality, and loſt his own former habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or beginning, and <hi>God hath reſerved him in everlaſting chains under darkneſs, unto the Judgment of the great Day, Jude</hi> v. 6. The forſaking of the Society of his fellow good Angels (if I may ſo ſay,) and forſaking of his firſt eſtate of Glory, leaving his former habitation, was his fall; like <hi>Adam</hi> and us, who left our firſt eſtate and habitation which was in God, and fell to the eating of that which was forbidden.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Where is this Dragon? He is in the Ayr: 2. He <hi>is in the children of diſobedience, Eph.</hi> 2. 2. wherein in times paſt ye walked accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the courſe of this world, according to the Prince of the power of the Ayr, the Spirit that now works in the children of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Theſis or Baſis upon which I ſhall build my Diſcourſe is this, That the Tail of the great red Dragon is that by which the Dragon draws the third part of the ſtars of Heaven out of Heaven into Earth. This is clear from the words, what the Dragon, and the Tail of the Dragon is, and what Heaven and Earth is, I have at large ſhewed before, and therefore I will not unfold the terms again, but make ſome Application of the words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:169841:20"/>
Firſt, This may ſerve to inform us of the truth of this, how that the great red Dragon by his tail draws the third part of the ſtars of Heaven out of Heaven, and caſteth them into the Earth: This we may ſee fulfilled in our days; how many ſhining ſtars hath the tail of the great red Dragon drawn out of Heaven, and caſt into the Earth? So that though they ſhined as ſtars in Heaven before, now they are become earthly, worldly, carnal and wicked, and do not ſtick to commit all manner of wickedneſs with greedineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But may ſome ſay, How doth the Dragon with his tail draw the third part of the ſtars of Heaven out of Heaven, and caſt them to the Earth? Theſe manner of ways following; That is to ſay:</p>
            <p>Firſt, He deals with them as with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi> juſt as he drew <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to eat of that which is forbidden, ſo he draws the ſtars of Heaven out of Heaven, and caſteth them into the Earth. See how he drew them to eat of that which was forbidden, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>Yea, ſaith the Serpent unto the woman, hath God ſaid, Ye ſhall not eat of every tree of the garden?</hi> No, ſaith the woman, <hi>We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden; but of the fruit of the tree that is in the midst of the</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:169841:20"/>
               <hi>garden we may not eat of it, nor touch it, for God hath ſaid it, lest we dye.</hi> Yea hath he ſaid it? is it indeed ſo? are you not miſtaken? are you ſure God ſpoke it? See how the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ſets upon her, and endeavors to make her queſtion the authority of Gods Word: And hath God ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall ſurely dye,</hi> that is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly dye? If you eat, ye ſhall not certainly dye: Here the Serpent makes himſelf to have more power then God; Ye may eat ſafely, ye ſhall not, though God hath ſaid it, dye; <hi>For God doth know, that in the day ye eat thereof your eyes ſhall be opened, and ye ſhall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</hi> As if the Serpent ſhould ſay, Let God ſay what he will, you ſhall not dye; for inſtead of dying, if you eat, your eyes ſhall be opened, and you ſhall be as gods in the knowing of good and evil: Come, ſaith the Serpent, eat, do not fear, you ſhall not dye, for you ſhall know good and evil, and ye ſhall know good and evil as gods know it, even that very day you eat it ſhall be ſo, ye ſhall no ſooner eat but it ſhall be ſo. Theſe things he gives as Reaſons that the woman ſhould not dye if ſhe did eat, becauſe her eyes ſhould be opened, and they ſhal know good and evil as God that very day they did eat. <hi>Now when the woman ſaw that the tree</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:169841:21"/>
               <hi>was good for food, and pleaſant to the eyes, and that it was a tree to be deſired to make one wiſe, the woman takes of the fruit thereof, and preſently falls upon eating.</hi> See, when the Serpent had made her queſtion the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Gods Word, and told her that ſhe ſhould not certainly dye if ſhe did eat, but her eyes ſhould be opened, and ſhe ſhould be as God in the knowing of good and evil; and likewiſe had perſwaded her that the tree was good in reſpect of food, and pleaſantneſs to the eye, and that it was a tree to be deſired, becauſe it makes one wiſe, the woman toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the man preſently takes of the fruit of it, and eats, as I ſaid before. The man and the woman had a deſire to have their eyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, they had a deſire to ſee, but not in the light of God; they thirſted after knowledg, they coveted to be as God in knowing good and evil, they coveted to be that which God would not have them, they coveted to ſatisfie their eyes and their pallates, they coveted wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that was not the wiſdom of God; and this was their fall: So that though they ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned like ſtars of Heaven before, now they are caſt down from thence into Earth, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come now earthly, worldly, carnal and ſinful. So that this is one way that the Dragon draws
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169841:21"/>
ſtars out of Heaven into Earth, by making Souls queſtion the Authority of Gods Word, whether or no it be true.</p>
            <p>The ſecond way or manner, how the great red Dragon draws with his Tail the third part of the ſtars of Heaven out of Heaven, and caſteth them to the Earth, is, by taking of them up into an exceeding high mountain, that is, by lifting them up on high, and ſo ſhewing of them the glory of this world, &amp; by promiſing them it, <hi>if they will fall down and worſhip him.</hi> Thus he hath dealt with many in our days, he hath exalted them on high, and given them a ſight of his glory, as credit, honour, repute, eſteem in the world, which are the Devils glory. Now thoſe that have been like ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtars in Heaven, in the appearance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the great red Dragon, by the preſenting of this his glory before them, hath by his Tail drawn them out of Heaven, and caſt them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Earth. So that this is another way the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon takes to draw the third part of the ſtars of Heaven out of Heaven, and caſt them into the Earth, he ſhews them the glory of this world, and by that draws them out of Heaven into Earth, as he hath done many in our days, who are turned from their ſhining like ſtars in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Devils glory; that is, they ſeek
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:169841:22"/>
after credit, honour, repute and eſteem in the world, of which thing we have had woful experience in our days.</p>
            <p>The third way and manner how the great red Dragon draws with his Tail the third part of the ſtars of Heaven out of Heaven, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to the Earth, is by his falſe applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture to Profeſſors, as that place of Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>All things are lawful.</hi> And if all things be lawful, then ſay they, all manner of wickedneſs is lawful, and ſo we may commit it: The Apoſtle ſaith not there, that all manner of wickedneſs is lawful, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, idolatry, adultery, and the like; for ſaith the Apoſtle in Verſ. 13. <hi>The body is not for fornication, but for the Lord.</hi> And beſides if we look in the beginning of that 13 Verſe, he ſpeaks of <hi>meats for the belly:</hi> And in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 23. he ſpeaks not there neither, that all manner of wickedneſs is lawful, though many ſay it is confirmed from theſe places of Scripture; for he ſpeaks againſt that in the beginning of the Chapter; and beſides he ſpeaks there of <hi>going to feaſts,</hi> and <hi>eating of meats:</hi> and in Verſ. 19. he ſpeaks of his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do thoſe things, which the weak could not. And then that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 14. the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon makes a falſe application of to poor Souls:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:169841:22"/>
               <hi>I know and am perſwaded by the Lord Jeſus, that there is nothing unclean of it ſelf, but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</hi> Say ſome, nothing is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean to us, no not ſin; we can commit any ſin, for we eſteem not any thing to be unclean, but thoſe that do, to thoſe it is ſin. O ſubtle Devil! He ſpeaks in the Chapter of obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing days, and eating herbs; he doth not there ſpeak that ſin in it ſelf is not unclean; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they eſteemed it not to be unclean, or whether they eſteemed it to be unclean, ſin is unclean. And then that place of Scripture the Devil makes application of to Profeſſors, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the pure all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled and unbeleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is nothing pure, but even their minds and conſciences are defiled.</hi> We are pure, ſay they, and ſo all things are pure to us, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, fornication, &amp;c. we are not defiled, but beleeving, and ſo all things are pure to us, but thoſe that beleeve not their minds and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are defiled. O poor creatures, where are you? who hath bewitched you? The meaning of that place is not, that ſin is pure to thoſe that are pure and beleeving, that is a deluſion of Satan; for thoſe words <hi>all things</hi> are meant days and meats: See in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 20.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169841:23"/>
               <hi>All things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>indeed are pure, but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</hi> In which Chapter he ſpeaks of meats and days, as I ſaid before, which are now pure to him, ſeeing the Ceremonial Law is aboliſhed by Chriſt, which put a difference between meats. Thus you ſee how the Devil beguiles them, thereby leading them to all manner of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. So that this is another way the Dragon takes to caſt ſhining ſtars out of Heaven into Earth, he makes falſe application of Scripture to them, and ſo draws them out of Heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Earth.</p>
            <p>The fourth way and manner, how the great red Dragon draws with his Tail the third part of the ſtars of Heaven out of Heaven, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to the Earth, is by uſhering in Errors with theſe ſix glorious Truths following; that is to ſay,</p>
            <list>
               <item>God doth all things.</item>
               <item>Is all things.</item>
               <item>All things are in God.</item>
               <item>All things are of God.</item>
               <item>All things are through God.</item>
               <item>And all things are to God.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt of all, God doth all things; and it is clear from Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>He worketh all in all:</hi> But yet it is to be taken, that he doth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:169841:23"/>
all things in his Son, nothing out of his Son; by him and in him he made the world, and he upholds it by him. But with and under this glorious Truth the Devil uſhereth in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that is not truth, thereby to draw thoſe that are like ſhining ſtars in Heaven out of Heaven into the Earth; that which he uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in in this ſaying, God doth all things, is this; If he doth all things, then he doth ſin, he acts ſin, there is not any thing that is but he doth it, wickedneſs is that he doth: With this ſnare the Dragon catcheth many Souls.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God is all things; and it is dear likewiſe from Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28. <hi>That God may be all in all.</hi> He is all things in and to Saints, he is Righteouſneſs, Peace, Joy, ſtrength againſt ſin, and he is all out of them, abroad in the world, he rules and he raigns. God is all, that is, he is the Subſtance of all things, he goes beyond all, he is all in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect likewiſe, becauſe he brings about all things; ſo that this is a glorious Truth, God is all things: Now the Dragon he uſhereth in with this Truth this Error, If God be all things, then he is ſin and wickedneſs; and if he be all things, then he is this Dog, this To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco-pipe, he is me, and I am him, as I have heard ſome ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:169841:24"/>
Thirdly, All things are in God; this is a glorious Truth likewiſe from Scripture; All creatures, all created things are in him: But yet it is not to be taken, that they are materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in him, but vertually, radically. Now this great red Dragon uſhereth in with this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Truth another Error, thereby, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to draw ſhining ſtars out of Heaven into Earth, which Error is, If all things be in God, then ſurely ſin is in him, and I am in him, though I walk never ſo wretchedly. But ſtay a little, you run too faſt: There is a two-fold Being in God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is a Being in him ſo as to live, move, and have our Being.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is Being in him, by vertue of being born again. So that here you are caught.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, All things are of God; this is cleer from Scripture likewiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>ult. for of him are all things,</hi> and that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>But to us there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things:</hi> all creatures all created things which belong to the old Creation and to the new Creation, are of him though in a different ſence they are of him, but yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are of him, yet this doth not follow that theſe creatures and created things are
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169841:24"/>
himſelf, as ſome ſay, then were every created thing and creature a God, and ſo make an infinite number of Gods: all things are of God, ſay they, if all things be of him, then ſin is of him and not of the Devill; and we are of him, and if we be of him, then we are himſelf, for whatſoever is of him is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Stay a little, that will not follow, for as I ſaid before, if that were a truth, what a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gods would you make! And beſides that will not follow, that ſin is of him becauſe all things are of him, for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>ſin is of the Devil,</hi> and therefore not of him, he is not the cauſe of it; Theſe are thoſe Errors which the great Red Dragon uſhereth in with this truth, <hi>All things are of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, All things are through God; This is a glorious truth ſuitable to Scripture, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>ult. For of him and through him are all things;</hi> It is through him that ſuch a thing comes to paſs, and that ſuch a thing is, and that we are alive: it was through him that the <hi>Jews</hi> were cut off, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ingraffed into a good Olive tree; it is through him, that is, it was Gods doings: here the great red Dragon uſhereth in an Error with this glorious Truth, Are all things through him? then ſin is through him, all that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169841:25"/>
that I commit is through him, that is, by his means; it is through Gods means that I am an adulterer, fornicator, &amp;c. he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it. O thou deceived creature, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil hath thee faſt; ſin is through your corrupt nature, and the Devil, and not through God.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, All things are to him; that is a a Truth likewiſe from Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>ult. And to him are all things, to whom be praiſe, &amp;c.</hi> All things are to him, that is, to his praiſe, to ſet forth his praiſe: And here the great red Dragon uſhereth in this Error, If all things be to his praiſe, then ſin is, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will ſin, for all my ſins that I commit ſhall be to his praiſe, and the more I ſin the more it ſhall be to his praiſe. Theſe are the ſix manner of ways by which the Dragon uſhereth in Error with Truth, thereby to draw the ſtars of Heaven out of Heaven, and caſt them to the Earth.</p>
            <p>The fift way and manner how the great red Dragon draweth with his Tall the ſtars of Heaven out of Heaven, and caſteth them to the Earth, is by the Dragons winding with his Tail into Profeſſors rotten and unſound Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. But you will ask me, What are they? Theſe following: that is to ſay;</p>
            <p>That they are very God, and infinite and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169841:25"/>
as the very God is; That they are in Honour, Excellency, Majeſty and Power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ally and the ſame with the true God; That the eternal Majeſty dwells in them, and no where elſe; That there is no ſuch thing as the Holineſs and Righteouſneſs of God; That unrighteouſneſs in them, and the acts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, prophane ſwearing, drunkenneſs, and the like filthineſs and bruitiſhneſs, are not unholy and forbidden in the Word; That theſe acts in them and others are approved of by God, and that ſuch acts, and the perſons that commit them, are like God: That the acts of denying and blaſpheming God, or the Holineſs and Righteouſneſs of God; That the acts of curſing God, ſwearing prophanely and falſly by his Name, and the acts of lying, ſtealing, cozening and defrauding others; the acts of murther, adultery, inceſt, fornication, unclean Sodomy drunkenneſs, filthy and laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cizious ſpeaking, are not things in themſelves ſhameful, wicked, ſinful, impious, abominable and deteſtable in any perſon: That the acts of adultery, drunkenneſs, ſwearing, and the like open wickedneſs, are in their own nature as holy and righteous as the duties of prayer, and giving of thanks; That whatſoever is acted by them, whether whoredom, adultery, drunkenneſs, and the like, may be committed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169841:26"/>
without ſin; and that ſuch acts are acted by the true God, or by the Majeſty of God, and by the Eternity that is in them: That Heaven and all happineſs conſiſt in the acting of thoſe things which are ſin and wickedneſs; That thoſe are moſt perfect, and like to God and Eternity, which do commit the greateſt ſins without leaſt remorſe or ſenſe; That there is no ſuch thing really and truly as unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſin, but as a man or a woman judgeth thereof; and that there is neither Heaven nor Hell, neither Salvation nor Damnation, and that theſe are one and the ſame thing, and that there is not any diſtinction between them, or between light and darkneſs; That Reaſon is God: That we ſhall not have peace and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs in our ſpirits, till we come into this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of whoring, ſwearing, and the like: That man is deified; That the ſpirit after a man is dead goes into a Dog or Cat; That God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves in God: That all the women in the world are but one mans wife in unity, and all the men in the world are but one womans husband in unity; ſo that one man may lie with all the women in the world, for they are his wife in unity, and one woman may lie with all men in the world, for they are her husband in unity: That there is no act that is ſinful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; That the holy Spirit is not God:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169841:26"/>
That Jeſus Chriſt hath no other then a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature. Theſe and many others are the Principles that the great red Dragon with his Tail windes into Profeſſors, thereby to caſt them out of Heaven into Earth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Friends take heed of him, he is very ſubtle, his Tail is full of windings and turnings; if it were poſſible he would deceive the very E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: If you be Profeſſors in ſhew, and not in deed, he will drag you down from Heaven into Earth; that is, he will drag you down from your glorious profeſſion into Earth; that is, into ſuch an eſtate of earthly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wickedneſs, that all that ſee you, and behold you, ſhall ſay of you, as it ſhall be ſaid of <hi>Babylon</hi> when ſhe is deſtroyed; <hi>Alas, alas, that great City that was clothed with fine linnen, and purple, and ſcarlet, and decked with gold, and precious ſtones, and pearls, for in one hour ſo great riches is come to nought, Revel.</hi> 18. 16, 17. So ſhall they ſay of you, O glorious Profeſſors, that have been as ſtars ſhining in Heaven, clothed with fine linnen, purple, and ſcarlet, and decked with gold, and precious ſtones, and pearls, which are nothing but the parts, and gifts, and righteouſneſs of men; Alas, alas, thoſe glorious Profeſſors, for in one hour, as it were, are they come to nought. So that you ſee how the Dragon
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169841:27"/>
draws Profeſſors out of Heaven into Earth, by winding with his Tail falſe and unſound prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples into them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But may ſome ſay, You hold a fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away from grace, do you not?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No; but I hold a falling away which is now fulfilled before the day of Chriſt come, ſpoken of in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 3. And beſides I hold a falling away from <hi>the end of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, which is Charity out of a pure heart, and a good Conſcience, and of faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, from which ſome having ſwerved, have turned aſide to vain jangling, which was Hymeneus and Alexander,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 20. And alſo a falling away from the heavenly gifts of thoſe that are inlightened, and are <hi>made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have taſted the good Word of God, and of the powers of the world to come, Hebr.</hi> 6. 4, 5. If Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors have reached no further then <hi>Charity,</hi> though it be <hi>out of a pure heart, and of a good Conſcience, and of Faith unfeigned,</hi> and no further then a <hi>being enlightened,</hi> and a <hi>taſting of the heavenly gifts,</hi> and a <hi>being made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and a <hi>taſting of the good Word of God, and of the powers of the World to come,</hi> they are liable to be by the Tail of this great red Dragon drawn out of Heaven, that is, drawn from theſe into Earth;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169841:27"/>
ſo that they will become earthly, filthy, vain, and the like.</p>
            <p>The third Baſis or Theſis upon which I ſhall build my Diſcourſe is this, That there is mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of ſubtilty, ſtrength and glory in the great red Dragon to deceive, accuſe, ſet upon, tempt and deſtroy. This is clear from the words; and it will appear to be ſo from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of Scripture: ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Now the Serpent was more ſubtle then any beaſt of the field which the Lord God had made:</hi> That ſheweth that there is a multiplicity of ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in him. <hi>We wrestle not only with fleſh and blood, but with principalities and powers, Epheſ. ult.</hi> Chap. That place of Scripture ſheweth, that there is a multiplicity of power in him. <hi>If thou wilt fall down and worſhip me,</hi> ſaith the Serpent to Chriſt, <hi>I will give you all the glory of the world:</hi> That ſpeaks a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of glory in the Dragon.</p>
            <p>We ſhall a little hold forth his ſubtilty, power and glory.</p>
            <p>Firſt we ſhall ſpeak of his ſubtilty; ſee <hi>Job</hi> 1. 6. <hi>When the ſons of God came to preſent themſelves before the Lord, Satan he came among them.</hi> See his ſubtilty in it, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in coming to pray with the ſons of God, he came to accuſe and ſet upon <hi>Job,</hi> as you ſhall ſee by and by; <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:169841:28"/>
               <hi>him, From whence comeſt thou? Then Satan anſwered the Lord, From going to and fro in the Earth, and from walking up and down in it:</hi> See his ſubtilty here, in leaving out <hi>like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may devour. And the Lord ſaid unto Satan, Haſt thou conſidered,</hi> or haſt thou ſet thy heart, <hi>on my ſervant Job, that there is none like him in the Earth, a perfect and upright man, one that feareth God, and eſcheweth evil? Then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Satan the Lord, and ſaid, Doth Job fear God for nought? Haſt thou not made a bedg about him, and about his houſe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout all that he hath on every ſide?</hi> Behold his ſubtilty again in accuſing <hi>Job:</hi> As if Satan ſhould have ſaid, Thou haſt made a fence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all that he hath, and he ſerves thee for that, it is not for nought that he ſerves thee; thou haſt encreaſed his ſubſtance, and bleſſed the work of his hand, and he ſerves thee for that; <hi>but put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will fall acurſing of thee,</hi> and that <hi>to thy face. And the Lord ſaid unto him, Behold all that he hath is in thy power, only upon himſelf put not forth thy hand. So Satan goes forth from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> After he had Gods <hi>Job,</hi> away he went, it was for <hi>Job</hi> that Satan preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before the Lord. Now in Cap. 2. they came
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:169841:28"/>
the ſecond time <hi>to preſent themſelves before the Lord, and Satan came with them: And the Lord ſaid unto him, from whence comeſt thou?</hi> And Satan gave him the like anſwer as before: <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto him, Haſt thou conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd my ſervant Job, a perfect &amp; upright man, that feareth God, and eſcheweth evil? and ſtill he holdeth faſt his integrity, although thou mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedſt me againſt him, to deſtroy him without cauſe.</hi> The ſubtilty of the Serpent in preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf before the Lord, was not only to accuſe <hi>Job,</hi> but likewiſe to move God againſt <hi>Job</hi> for to deſtroy him without cauſe. <hi>And Satan anſwered the Lord, Skin for skin, yea all that a man hath will he give for his life: But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and fleſh, and he will curſe thee to thy face.</hi> See how he further accuſeth <hi>Job</hi> before God, that ſo God might deſtroy him, or that he might have him to deſtroy: As if Satan ſhould have ſaid to the Lord thus; All that a man hath, before he will loſe his life, he will part with all, yea skin for skin; but do but touch his bone and fleſh, and he will fall acur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of thee to thy face, even before thy face. Satan cannot endure a <hi>Job,</hi> but he is always accuſing and ſetting upon him. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto him, Behold he is in thy hand, but ſave his life.</hi> Though God delivers us with
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169841:29"/>
               <hi>Job</hi> into the hands of Satan, yet he will not have Satan take away our life: As Satan pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf before the Lord with the ſons of God, ſo he doth now preſent himſelf with the Saints before God, but it is to accuſe us to God, that he might have a commiſſion from God to ſet upon us, to afflict us, not only in our goods, but in our body: He ſpeaks of us to God as he did of <hi>Job, It is not for nought that yo ſerve God,</hi> ſaith Satan to poor Souls; you fear him for this and for that, he hath thus and thus bleſſed you, and made a hedg about you; and if God ſhould put forth his hand, and touch you, you would curſe him. See his ſubtilty in <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1. There is <hi>Satan ſtanding at the right hand of Joſhua the high Priest, who ſtood before the Angel of the Lord.</hi> His ſubtilty in <hi>ſtanding at Joſhuahs right hand</hi> was <hi>to reſist</hi> and withſtand <hi>Joſhuah:</hi> Satan he had eſpyed <hi>Ioſhuahs filthy rayments</hi> that were upon him, as he <hi>ſtood before the Angel:</hi> Now his ſubtilty in ſtanding there was to withſtand <hi>Joſhuah:</hi> Thou haſt filthy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſtandeſt thou before the Angel? what doſt thou here with theſe filthy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on thee? But afterwards he was <hi>clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with change of rayment.</hi> So he ſpeaks to a poor Soul many times when he preſents himſelf before God, What doſt thou here
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169841:29"/>
with theſe ſinful garments upon thee? how dar'ſt thou come before God with theſe? thereby to keep it from God; this is his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty. And we may ſee his ſubtilty in the words; he <hi>ſtands before the woman,</hi> but it was <hi>to devour the man-child.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, We ſhall a little conſider the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons power. But you wil ask me what is it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, The power of the Dragon is expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Scripture.</item>
               <item>Secondly, Sin.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, Darkneſs.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, The power of the Dragon is expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Scripture. I pray bear with me a little: In this expreſſion my meaning is, he makes uſe of Scripture whereby to ſtrengthen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt a Saint, as he did againſt Chriſt; ſee how he did it againſt Chriſt, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 6. ſaith the Devil to Chriſt, <hi>Cast thy ſelf down, for he hath given his Angels charge over thee, to bear thee up, lest at any time thou daſh thy foot against the ſtones.</hi> So he ſaith to a poor Soul, Thou mayſt kill thy ſelf, God hath given his Angels charge over thee to keep thee. As <hi>the ſtrength of ſin is the Law,</hi> ſo the ſtrength of Satan is Scripture, (as I may ſo ſay.)</p>
            <p>Secondly, Sin: The power of the Dragon is ſin; that is, the Dragon makes uſe of ſin, whereby to ſtrengthen himſelf againſt a Soul,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169841:30"/>
1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Whoſoever abideth in him, ſinneth not: Whoſoever ſinneth, hath not ſeen nor known him.</hi> Now ſaith the Dragon to the Soul, You do not abide in God becauſe you ſin; you have ſinned, ſaith the Devil, and you cannot deny it, and therefore you have not ſeen nor known God; when as the Soul hath not only ſinned, but only the Law in the fleſh, ſin in the Soul, not the mind hath ſinned. Now for want of diſtinction between the ſpiritual part and the fleſhly part of the Soul, the Soul is ſo troubled by Satan, that it knows not what to do.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Darkneſs: The power of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon is darkneſs; that is, he makes uſe of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whereby to ſtrengthen himſelf againſt the Soul: <hi>If we ſay we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs, we lye,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 6. Now ſaith the Dragon, You are in the dark, and you walk in darkneſs, and the Soul knows it is in darkneſs, therefore you have no fellowſhip with God and Chriſt: And the poor Soul is troubled, that it knows not what to do; when as that darkneſs is called there a <hi>hating our brother,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We ſhall a little ſpeak of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons glory: His glory is honor, repute, eſteem, preferment; his crowns which are upon his heads are his glory, which hold forth royalty
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169841:30"/>
and rule, as I ſaid before; That angelical light into which he is changed, is his glory; that heavenly light in which he appears to Saints is his glory, his lamb-like horns are his glory, his ſeeming ſavor of piety, zeal and holineſs is his glory, as I ſaid before.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo, That there is a multiplicy of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, ſtrength and glory in the red Dragon to accuſe, ſet upon, tempt and deſtroy, then take heed of his ſubtilty, power &amp; glory, leſt you be enſnared in either: if he cannot catch you by his ſubtilty, he will have you by his power; and if he cannot have you by his power, then he will catch you by his glory: <hi>Be you therefore wiſe as Serpents,</hi> and conſider what you have to deal withall; <hi>watch and pray, lest ye enter into temptation,</hi> and let your eyes be always opened, for this <hi>Dragon goes up and down like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fourth Baſis or Theſis upon which I ſhall build my Diſcourſe, is this, That no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is the Church of Chriſt ready to bring forth Chriſt in her, but the Dragon ſtands ready, before her face, to devour him. This is clear from the words: The Dragons aim is not ſo much to devour the Church of Chriſt, though he ſtands before it, but Chriſt in the Church of Chriſt; his enmity is more at Chriſt, then the woman; he cannot endure Chriſt ſhould be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169841:31"/>
in the Church, he will labor as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he can to devour him, and the reaſon of it, is, becauſe he is to rule with a rod of Iron the Nations: Now the Dragon he would rule, and therefore the Dragon hath great wrath againſt the Lamb, knowing his time to be ſhort. When he was ſeen by <hi>Iohn</hi> to be caſt out of Heaven into Earth, he falls a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the woman that brought forth Chriſt: When the Dragon could do nothing to Chriſt he ſets upon the woman, when ſhe was flying into the wilderneſs, which is her place, where <hi>ſhe is nouriſhed for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the Serpent. The Dragon casteth out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cauſe her to be carried away therewith.</hi> And when the Dragon could do no good with the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he was <hi>wroth with her, and went to make War with the remnant of her ſeed.</hi> Firſt he ſeeks to deſtroy Chriſt in us; if he cannot prevail that way, then he will ſeek to devour the woman that brings forth Chriſt; when he cannot do that, then he will ſeek to devour her ſeed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, If it be ſo, That no ſooner is the Church of Chriſt ready to bring forth Jeſus Chriſt, but the Dragon ſtands ready to devour him, then let the woman and her ſeed beware
<pb facs="tcp:169841:31"/>
of him, let her ſeed eſpecially: And as for the woman, ſhe hath a <hi>place prepared for her in the Wilderneſs, from the face of the Serpent, Revel.</hi> 12. 14. A great bleſſedneſs it is, though it be in the wilderneſs, that is, in a bewilded ſtate, for there the child Jeſus is kept from the Dragons mouth. O ye remnant of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſeed! therefore the Dragon went to make war with you; and therefore I will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect my ſpeech to you: It is you the Dragon aims at, it is you the Dragon will have about with, it is you that he will make war with; ſtand to your arms therefore, be not without your weapons always in your hands; be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways girt about with truth, and having on the <hi>brest-plate of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and your feet ſhod with the preparation of the <hi>Gospel of Peace;</hi> and <hi>above all, take the ſhield of Faith, wherewith you ſhall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the Devil: And take the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met of Salvation, and the ſword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God; praying always with all prayer and ſupplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> leſt you be conquered, and your Jeſus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured before your face. <hi>Above all take the ſhield of Faith:</hi> The beſt weapon to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dragon is Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But you will ask me, What is it? and how ſhall we uſe it? I ſhall according to
<pb facs="tcp:169841:32"/>
my light ſhew you that, becauſe Faith is little ſpoken of now adays, and ſo make an end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, I ſhall ſhew you what Faith is; It is the fixing of the heart on Chriſt, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 57. 7. It <hi>is the ſubstance of things hoped for,</hi> and <hi>the evidence of things not ſeen, Hebr.</hi> 1. 1.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, <hi>Faith is the ſubstance of things hoped for</hi> by us; that is, it is the ground or confidence of things hoped for; it gives us ground and confidence of things that are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for by us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is <hi>the evidence of,</hi> or it is that which evidenceth to our ſpirits, <hi>things not ſeen;</hi> that is, things we do not ſee, it is that which evidenceth to us things not ſeen, or it is the conviction of things not ſeen by us, it convinceth us of things not ſeen.</p>
            <p>The next thing is, how faith is to be uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dragon; juſt as <hi>Iacob</hi> uſed it when he wreſtled with the Angel: But how was that? See <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. <hi>And Iacob was left alone; and there wreſtled a man with him, until the breaking of the day: And when he ſaw that he prevailed not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, he touched the hollow of Iacobs thigh, and the hollow of Iacobs thigh was out of joynt.</hi> Here is <hi>Iacob</hi> and an Angel wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling together till break of day; here is the Angel not prevailing: when the Angel ſaw he prevailed not againſt <hi>Iacob,</hi> he put <hi>Iacobs</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:169841:32"/>
thigh out of joynt as he wreſtled with him, which was to try <hi>Iacobs</hi> faith. See here the hollow of <hi>Iacobs</hi> thigh out of joynt: After the doing of which by the Angel, he ſaith, <hi>Let me go, Iacob:</hi> The Angel would have been gone, had not <hi>Iacobs</hi> faith kept him from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Saith <hi>Iacob, I will not let thee go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a bleſſing:</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Bleſs me, and then thou ſhalt go; I muſt be bleſſed, and I am reſolved to be bleſſed, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hollow of my thigh is out of joynt: Here is <hi>Iacobs</hi> faith, he would not let go, but he would hang upon the Angel ſtill. Juſt as if two were wreſtling together, and the one ſhould put out the hollow of the thigh of the other, and that other, though he could not wreſtle, ſhould hang upon the other, and hold him with his hands: So it is here; <hi>Iacob,</hi> though he cannot wreſtle, yet he hangs upon and holds with his hands the Angel, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved he will hang there, and if the Angel went he would go with him, hanging upon him, unleſs the Angel bleſſed him: Behold, what faith is here? When the Angel ſaw he would not let him go unleſs he bleſſed him, the Angel asked him his name; and he ſaid his name was <hi>Iacob: And the Angel ſaid, Thou ſhalt no more be called Iacob, but Iſrael;</hi> which ſignifies a prevailer and conqueror: There is the bleſſing. So that let your hearts
<pb facs="tcp:169841:33"/>
be fixed on Chriſt, as one that is not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove you, that is to ſay, in the Heavens, but alſo within you; and do not mind the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon ſo much as faith in Chriſt: We fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Dragon and ſin many times, and never think of Chriſt; but let your eyes be ſet upon him, and do not wreſtle with the Dragon, but with Chriſt againſt the Dragon, and then you wreſtle aright. We wreſtle with the Dragon, and not with Chriſt againſt the Dragon, we never think of him, and that is the reaſon we do not prevail: Wreſtle with Chriſt againſt the Dragon, and let your eyes be placed on him, and though he touch the hollow of your thigh, &amp; put it out of joynt, as I may ſo ſay, that is, take away your ſtrength, ſo that you cannot wreſtle with Chriſt, as many times he doth take away our power, to ſee whether we, though we cannot wreſtle, yet will depend and hang upon him; tell Chriſt, if he attempts to go away from you, that though you cannot wreſtle with him, yet you will depend and hang upon him, that if he go away, it ſhall be with you hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon him; though he ſay to you, Let me go, yet do you reply again to him, and ſay, We will not let thee go, except thou bleſs us: Then he will enquire of your names, and give you other names, and call you Iſraelites, that is, Prevailers over the Dragon.</p>
