            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REMARKS
FROM THE
COUNTRY.</head>
            <p>I Am ſorry to find the Abilities of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
ſo much diſtruſted by ſome of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
that it ſhould be thought neceſſary to ſend
publick Letters of advice, by way of charitable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
to direct them what to do; had they been left to
themſelves, they might poſſibly have erred dangerouſly
concerning thoſe Fundamental Points of the <hi>Kalendar,</hi> the
old Tranſlation of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> the <hi>Surplice,</hi> &amp;c. and have
retained a too favourable opinion of the Service and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of <hi>England,</hi> which is now become the only into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
and unpardonable Hereſy. That Reverend Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
will I hope pardon me, if at preſent I wave all vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the capacity they may be preſumed to have, for
the ſetling of theſe profound Points; for it would reflect
too much upon the wiſdom of thoſe Directors, if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
ſhould appear to ſtand in no need of their chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and their Letters look like a too forward and ſolemn
impertinence. It is a Thouſand Pities ſo inſtructive and ſo
Eloquent Papers ſhould ever fall under ſuch an imputation,
and be ranked among the Scriblings of <hi>Elenor James,</hi> with
this only advantage of having better Language; whereas
the Woman Counſellor is judged to have the better
meaning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:100336:3"/>
But ſuppoſing the Convocation ſo weak indeed as this
way of Proceeding does ſuggeſt, and that the matters to
be brought before them, like Childrens Meat, muſt be chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before-hand, and put into their Mouths; yet the charity
had born a better grace, if it had been conveyed more
privately, and had concealed thoſe defects of our Church
Repreſentative which it pretended to ſupply. If theſe
Gentlemen intended only to be Prompters to the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
they miſtook their part, and ſpoke much too loud,
and inſtead of Aſſiſting, ſerved only to Diſgrace the Actors.
Therefore when theſe inſtructing Papers were publictly
expoſed among the Toys of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
by <hi>Hawkers,</hi> together with <hi>Scotch</hi> News, and <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervators,</hi>
it is no wonder if the Company at <hi>Harry</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth's
Chappel reſented the affront, and cryed out a <hi>Libel,</hi>
and carryed their Complaints as far as <hi>Jeruſalem-Chamber</hi>
there to be decently buried in Oblivion.</p>
            <p>It is doubtleſs out of pure condeſcention, that one of
theſe Directors is pleaſed to ſtile himſelf a <hi>Miniſter in the
Countrey;</hi> the undertaking does not agree very well with his
Character, and it is ſeldom that Perſons of that Rank take
upon them to direct and Chatechiſe Synods. Country Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
Poor Men, are at too great a diſtance from the
Spring of Buſineſs to be ſo early acquainted with theſe
Myſteries, hid from the Country, till theſe Letters Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
them. But the Knowledge of affairs, and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
that commonly attends too much Knowledge,
ſpeaks this Author rather of the Commiſſion than of the
Country. But if the Title be ſerious, it is a great Pity
that the obſcure Dull Country, that knows not how to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
ſuch a Treaſure, ſhould poſſeſs him any longer ſo much
to his own diſadvantage, as well as to the regret of the
Court and City.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Letter to a Friend</hi> is pleaſed to give
ſome intimations of his being a Member of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which ſome Perſons who wiſh well to the deſign of
the Letter, will by no means allow; and indeed it ſeems
ſomething odd and prepoſterous, that a Perſon of ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100336:3"/>
and irreſiſtible Eloquence, ſhould in the Firſt place
enter his publick Proteſtation, and make his final Appeal
to the People, before he had tryed the force of one of his
Reaſons within-doors. But ſome of our Friends from
this rough way of Proceeding, gueſſed him to be an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker,
who was to prepare Men as well as Matter for
this Convocation; and not finding the ſucceſs of his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
application to anſwer the expectations he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
or the aſſurances he had given, grew wroth with
the diſappointment, and fearing to have loſt his deſign,
loſt his Patience and Diſcretion to that degree, as to cry
out of Obſtinacy and Rigor, and in a ſort to poſt the
Convocation for Stiff and Inflexible People, before any
thing had been in due form laid before them.</p>
            <p>You may imagine from this beginning, that I ſhall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from the ſenſe of theſe Letters in every Point propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
but to prevent ſuch a Miſtake, I will let you ſee at ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out how eaſily we are agreed; for I joyn heartily
with the Country Miniſter in the Firſt thing he lays
down, <hi>p.</hi> 3, 4. as the Foundation of what he afterwards
ſhould propoſe, <hi>that there are ſuch things in the Church of</hi>
England <hi>that are in their own nature alterable,</hi> and the other
Letter notes it as <hi>a great miſtake in us to hold any thing of this
nature not preſcribed in Scripture to be unalterable.</hi> I have ſome
exception againſt the words <hi>in us,</hi> becauſe I do not know
the Companions of his Miſtake; and I dare be bound to
free all Church of <hi>England</hi> men from the imputation. For
how addicted ſoever they may be thought to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
and their forms, I never could meet with any of
them ſo unreaſonably ſtiff, as not readily to allow every
thing of Humane Inſtitution and uſe, to be in it's nature
changeable. And becauſe I would not have a Point ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
true as I take this to be, brought under evil ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
by a Falſe Argument, I deſire the Convocation-Man
pretended, to Pray in the Aid of ſomebody who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
the Language, and to look over the Titles of thoſe
Twenty Volumes of <hi>Greek</hi> Liturgies, that he calls to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<hi>p.</hi> 13. 4. <hi>how much the</hi> Greek <hi>Church has altered Forms,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100336:4"/>
for fear all theſe Volumes ſhould happen to be <hi>not ſo many
different Forms of their Liturgies,</hi> often altered and brought
to a Review, but parts of one and the ſame Service; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I do not remember many Volumes of <hi>Greek</hi> Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
Printed, beſides thoſe which as ſeveral Offices make
up the preſent Service of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church. There are
indeed Three old ones Printed by <hi>Morellius,</hi> but all of them
not half ſo big as our <hi>Common-Prayer.</hi> There is one thing
more which I would deſire him to conſider for the ſake of
this firſt Point in which we are agreed, and that is what
he affirms in the ſame place, <hi>p.</hi> 14, <hi>that the Act of King</hi>
Edward <hi>the</hi> 6th, <hi>was the Firſt Law for an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform Liturgy in
any Church, that was ever Enacted from the beginning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
to that time.</hi> Such a man as our Author who ſpeaks
of <hi>M. SS.</hi> in the lump, cannot be ignorant that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of Provincial Synods, for Uniform Liturgies, had the
effect of Laws, and eſpecially in theſe Weſtern parts, where
Kings were commonly preſent in Synods, and ratified
what was there concluded. This Men of ordinary Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may be allowed to know, becauſe it is in Print; but
beſides many very ordinary Men without affecting to pry
into the Secrets of Learning, have heard of ſuch Men as
King <hi>Pippin</hi> and his Son <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and that they
laid aſide the <hi>French</hi> Service, and eſtabliſhed the <hi>Roman</hi> in
its place, and that by ſuch Laws as paſſed in thoſe times:
And <hi>Charles</hi> in his conſtitution, <hi>de Emendatione Librorum
Eccleſiaſticorum,</hi> expreſly ratifies the <hi>Service Book</hi> ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by a Law, <hi>noſtra eadem volumina authoritate conſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limus,
veſtraque Religioni in Chriſti Eccleſtis tradimus ad legen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</hi>
It was likewiſe by Law, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Office was
Eſtabliſhed in <hi>Spain</hi> under <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the 6th, much againſt
the grain of the Church, which could not part with its
old Office without Tears. Therefore to conclude this
Point, that there are things in their nature alterable, I
would deſire this Gentleman to alter theſe Paſſages, if he
thinks fit in the next Edition of his Letter.</p>
            <p>Now that you may not think, that we ſhake hands here
at ſetting out, in order to part preſently; I do willingly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100336:4"/>
agree with the ſame Author, P. 1. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>That nothing is more
dangerous to Religion, than frequently to make alterations in
things pertaining thereto:</hi> Nay, though it were <hi>in outward
Circumſtantials only that the Church of</hi> England <hi>may be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in her proceedings hitherto, that ſhe has not been forward on
every demand of the Diſſenters, to unhinge thoſe of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
from her long received Eſtabliſhments, but has to the
utmoſt reſisted all alterations from them, hoping by leſs dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
methods to cure,</hi> &amp;c. When I met with ſo many paſſages
in theſe Letters, reflecting with great ſharpneſs upon our
Service and preſent Conſtitution, I began to be affraid,
that we might have been in the wrong, ever ſince <hi>Edward</hi>
the 6th. Days: But I took courage when I found that hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all had been well, and provided we yield our ſelves
tractable upon this occaſion, all our paſt proceedings and
ſtifneſs againſt Diſſenters may be juſtified. It is well for
the Church that ſhe needs not apprehend any retroſpect
into her behaviour; ſince as Times go with Churchman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
it muſt be acknowledged to be no common favour.
But good Sir, how can this Liberality conſiſt with thoſe
Reflections you make upon the paſt Conduct of the Church,
how can it conſiſt with your Cenſure of <hi>that unreaſonable
Rigor, whereby we have hitherto maintained them.</hi> P. 5. or
with this kind Expoſtulation, <hi>have we not already loſt our
Reputation with the People of the Land, by inſisting too rigorouſly
on thoſe things?</hi> How can it agree with the frightful Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
you are pleaſed to give of the faults of the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.
P. 15. <hi>for if me are forced to read ſuch ridiculous things
to our People inſtead of the Word of God; if by reading the
old Tranſlation of the Pſalms we impoſe that on our People for
true Scripture, which in ſo great a Number of places quite differs
from it; and if there be many Grievances, and Defects of this
Nature which he could tell us of, to which we are bound:</hi> If all
this be in earneſt, I muſt needs confeſs, that I cannot ſee
how we may be juſtified for the Time paſt; for were theſe
<hi>ridiculous things</hi> leſs ridiculous, or theſe reading Pſalms leſs
differing from true Scripture a hundred years ago? Was
it allowable to retain <hi>moſt Religious and Gracious King</hi> in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100336:5"/>
laſt Reigns, and is it now grown a <hi>Flattery not to be warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi>
Thoſe things that are now ſuch Grievances and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
were they of another Nature in the Days of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth?</hi> In ſhort, the Liturgy and Conſtitution of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> are they grown worſe and more into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
now than when theſe Gentlemen thought fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
their Aſſent and Conſent to them? Yet both give the
Church and Liturgy very good words; <hi>a Church,</hi> ſays one,
<hi>which I am certain of in reſpect of its Doctrin, Worſhip and
Order is inferior to none upon upon the Face of the Earth.</hi> P. 1.
<hi>As to the Liturgy of our Church,</hi> ſays the other, <hi>I freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
and I think no Man can contradict me herein, that
it is the beſt which was ever yet uſed in any Chriſtian Church,</hi>
P. 12. Now if this Liturgy, ſo faulty, ſo ridiculous, ſo
wicked as to impoſe falſe Scripture upon the People be yet
the beſt of any, and if this Church with all the Faults here
repreſented, ſo unwary as to turn the Sign of the Croſs
into a Sacrament, be inferior to none; God help the reſt
I ſay! I am afraid, that I ſhould be tempted to have a very
ſorry opinion of Churches and Liturgies, if I had not ſome
hopes that our Authors might be miſtaken in many of
thoſe things they expoſe for the Defects of the Church of
<hi>England:</hi> But I muſt confeſs, that I cannot ſee how 'tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to reconcile the Complement with the Reproach.
<hi>Weigelius</hi> indeed pretends, that in the School of Grace Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictories
may be reconciled and united by the mind; but
the matter being paſſed my Skill, all the Service I can do
him is to refer him to that Myſtical Divine.</p>
            <p>I once thought, theſe alterations ſo much talked of,
were intended by way of condeſcention and favour;
but when I find theſe Advocates for the project, lick up the
Venome of the Diſſenters, and ſpit it in the face of their
own Church; when they try to give new ſtrength to old
weak Objections, and affect new Quarrels and Cavils againſt
the Liturgy; there is too great reaſon to be jealous, that
they do not intend to mediate an Accommodation, but
to procure a Conqueſt for the Diſſenters. Many there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that ſeemed not averſe to make ſome Conceſſions,

provided it might have been to any good effect, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
diſcouraged by the method which theſe underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
took to perſwade them. For if this new pretended
Reformation, cannot be introduced but upon the Diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Condemnation of the old, if it muſt reflect
blemiſh and infamy upon the Memory of the preceeding
Generations of our Church, if it muſt through Contempt
and Ignominy upon ſo many excellent Perſons, who have
not only conſented to this Conſtitution, but defended and
juſtified it againſt the frivolous Exceptions of Diſſenters; if
this be the Caſe, you muſt pardon me, if I have not now that
inclination to alterations which I own my ſelf to have had
heretofore.</p>
            <p>Neither would I be thought ſo punctilious, as to prefer
a Point of Honour to a Caſe of Neceſſity. If it be ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to make theſe Changes; if it will unite all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
and create an univerſal Concord; I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to diſcharge all theſe Circumſtantials, and bid them
ſtand out of the way of ſuch mighty Bleſſings. That ſo
it is, a certain Perſon poſitively affirms <hi>to a Friend,</hi> P. 2.
<hi>I think now to make ſuch alterations as are propoſed, ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary as ought no longer to be deferred,</hi> and then P. 8.
<hi>That theſe things adminiſter only to Schiſm and Diviſion in the
Church, and to Diſtraction in the State;</hi> and again, P. 9. <hi>They
become miſchievous too in the Evils that they bring upon the
Church and State.</hi> Nay further, P. 10. <hi>I here plainly aver,
that the Church of</hi> England <hi>cannot be guiltleſs in this matter,</hi>
if <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he do not alter ſome of theſe things. And to conclude,
<hi>The preſent Poſture of Affairs require it: For the greateſt hopes
of the French for our Deſtruction is from our Diviſions—and
what remedy have we left to prevent this terrible Ruine, but to
come to as firm a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion among our ſelves as we are able? and the
hopes of preſerving Church and State from the great dangers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which they are both involved, do in a great meaſure depend
upon what we ſhall do.</hi> P. 5. Who could have imagined,
that theſe little things ſhould be of ſo great Conſequence
either for good or hurt? If theſe <hi>Trifles</hi> had but ſenſe enough
to underſtand the Charge layed againſt them, they could
not but wonder with the Fly upon the Coach-wheel at the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100336:6"/>
mighty Duſt they made; and could they but ſpeak for
themſelves, they might plead with the Officers of the
Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Exod. 5. 16. <hi>Behold thy Servants are
beaten, but the fault is in thine own People.</hi> However ſince
they are ſo poſitively accuſed of having raiſed the Tempeſt,
and there is no way to calm it, but by throwing theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
occaſions overboard: Let us conſent, and by way
of ſuppoſition lay all theſe things aſide. Now Sirs, it is
all done as you have ordered: Call the Diſſenters in, that
the Church may be full: Go to the Quakers, for they are a
numerous and very compact Party; and let them know,
that there is now neither <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> nor obſolete Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
nothing but Scripture in the Leſſons; that there are
now Collects more ſpiritual than the old, and in ſhort, a
Liturgy, and a Church better than the beſt. What An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
think ye, the Foreman of a Quaker Aſſembly would
probably return to ſuch an Invitation? You may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
expect ſomething to this purpoſe. Friend, go to thy
Steeple-houſe and thy dead Letter again, thou mighteſt have
kept thy old Leſſons, and thy Prayers for us, and forbear
tempting and troubling our Spirit any further.</p>
            <p>But pray Sirs, be not ſo far diſcouraged by the obſtinacy
of one unmannerly Sect, as not to proceed to a Trial of
the reſt. Carry then your reformed Liturgy to the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,
and acquaint them what glorious Alterations you
have made, and that it is now quite another thing from
the old one, at which they were ſo juſtly offended: Nay,
the Sign of the Croſs in Baptiſm, that great Stumbling-block,
is removed, and the Surplice that offended tender
Eyes, is turned into Aprons for the Church-warden's
Wife: Come Brethren, let us all go into one Church, and
then we ſhall beat the <hi>French,</hi> and ſave the Nation. When
you had ſaid all you could, the Paſtor on behalf of his
ſworn Congregation would gravely tell you, that you
were much miſtaken, if you intended to gain them by your
Alterations. For you could not but know, that their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
were not againſt this or that paſſage in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer,
but againſt the whole; all Forms of Prayer in
their opinion tending to ſuppreſs the free motions of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100336:6"/>
Spirit: Beſides, what could it avail in reſpect of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that the Croſs in Baptiſm was removed, ſince Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
was to them a greater Offence, than all the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Church of <hi>England?</hi> and as for the <hi>French,</hi> they
were willing to joyn againſt them; but there was no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of making the Church the General Rendezvous.</p>
            <p>The Deſign is great and generous. I beſeech you do not
ſit down and deſpair after, but two Denials. Go on to the
Independents, for they are civil Men; and tell your Story
to the beſt Advantage. Tell them, that now you have
Prayers that Angels would be content to joyn in; Prayers,
that muſt make all men Saints that uſe them; come then
to our Church, and ſee the new and heavenly Face of
things theſe Alterations have made; You cannot poſſibly
find fault now with our Pariſh Churches: Beſides, there is
an abſolute Neceſſity now for our joyning in one national
Church, otherwiſe the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> will be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us. Pariſh-Churches, and national Churches, reply the
Independents; and what can the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Philistins</hi>
do worſe? You know we are in Covenant with God, and
with our Paſtors, from which we cannot recede, though
all the World ſhould be deſtroyed: Thoſe mixed Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and Pariſh Aſſemblies our Souls hate, and therefore
do not urge us. We have our Liberty now to meet in
our own way, and for ought I know this Diſturbance you
have given us, may fall within the Compaſs of the Act:
You know the Forfeit, therefore be wiſe. But before you
go, take your Anſwer in the words of the Prophet; <hi>who
has required this at your hand?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Gentlemen, if you are weary of walking, ſend for
<hi>T. F.</hi> and the <hi>Socinians;</hi> he perhaps may owe you a Viſit,
and will be glad of an opportunity to ſhew his Coach.
Let him underſtand his Obligation to you, how for his
ſake you have either taken away the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed, or
pulled out the Sting of it. It is therefore more for their
Credit to joyn with us upon this occaſion, than to make
themſelves odious to all Chriſtians, by joining intereſt and
Friendſhip with <hi>Mahometans.</hi> A Man of leſs Pertneſs than
<hi>T. F.</hi> would return upon you, That you cannot expect any
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100336:7"/>
compliance from them, as long as the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, the
Spring of all the Doctrin which makes up your Myſtery,
and their Abomination, does remain; they will do you the
civility to hear you Preach, provided you confine your ſelves
to Morality, and forbear the Doxology at the Concluſion.</p>
            <p>Unfortunate Enterpriſe! yet ſurely thou deſerveſt a more
favourable Providence, and a more ſuitable ſucceſs: But
Sirs, be of good comfort, there is yet one hopeful reſerve
that can never fail you, I mean the good <hi>Presbyterians;</hi>
make haſte therefore to Mr. <hi>A.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> before the
<hi>Scotch</hi> Covenanters have engaged them: make them ſenſible
that the Gates of Iron are broken down, and the <hi>Trojan</hi>
Horſe may now enter in with all that he has in his Belly,
without any hard Examination that may diſcover a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy.
Now the Ceremonies are given up as uſeleſs and
miſchievous; now the Communion may be given you Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or Sitting, or Lolling if you think it more for Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
all Superſtition and Offence is taken out of the
way, and all the old Demands yielded; nay there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left in our new Book, that ever fell under your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure:
Come in now, for we have engaged for you,
and all our Credit is at ſtake. Methinks I ſee Mr. <hi>A.</hi> draw
his Mouth, and put this ſly Queſtion, And muſt this new
Book be impoſed? Why, you will ſay it is ſo abſolute and
ſo perfect that it were to be wiſhed that it were impoſed
upon the whole World. Nay ſaith Mr. <hi>A.</hi> do you not know
<hi>the miſchief of impoſitions?</hi> Can you be ignorant that it is
our Common Doctrin from which we can never depart,
That Command changes the nature of the thing? Beſides
after all your Cobling, it is ſtill but <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and our
People can never endure it; for after they have been uſed
to the excellence and variety of our Spiritual effuſions, they
will never ſuffer themſelves to be brought down to the
Poor and Beggerly Elements of <hi>Common-Prayer.</hi> To be brief,
it is our Fervent pouring out, is the very Brandy of Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
thoſe that are once accuſtomed to it, can never leave it.</p>
            <p>For the laſt Stage of your Apoſtleſhip for Union, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
your ſelves to the moderate Presbyterians, if any ſuch
Creatures there be; you may aſſure your ſelves they are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100336:7"/>
but few, and ſcarce ariſe to the number of the Apoſtles:
However they are conſiderable for the ſcarcity of them, if
for nothing elſe; theſe are your own wherever you can find
them, for it is impoſſible they ſhould ever reſiſt the Power
of your Alterations, when they come to underſtand that
for their ſakes you have changed your conſtitution, and
hazarded the diſpleaſure and ſeparation of your own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
But becauſe it is cuſtomary after the firſt Groan for
the Zeal of theſe Good Men, to Fire againſt Lords, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
and the Hierarchy, give them the Wink, and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
them in the Ear, that perhaps it may come now to
the turn of ſuch Godly Men as they, to be Biſhops: Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
your ſelf, this will make them much more moderate,
eſpecially when they ſee ſo many Biſhops Seats upon the
point of being pronounced void, and the countenance of
the Court to ſhine ſo auſpiciouſly upon their merit. And
leſt they may fear this Hierarchy may lye too heavy upon
their Conſciences; you may aſſure them that care ſhall be
taken to relieve them under this Oppreſſion; and they
may when they think fit, reſign their Dignity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue,
and have the Honour of ſtanding laſt in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
of that order. And what better courſe can they
take to ſecure themſelves a Name in after Ages, than that
it ſhall be ſaid, that in them the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hierarchy ſo much
ſpoken againſt, did finally expire? One Private Friendly
reaſon in ones ear, proves many times more convincing
than all the Arguments that can be alledged in Print or
Publick Diſputation; and to moderate Men, Alterations
with Preferments muſt be irreſiſtible motives of Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
unleſs they think they have a fairer Game than this
you would put into their hands, and it ſhall ſeem more
adviſable to them, to ſtick where they are, than to joyn
in a diſcouraged ſinking Communion. This ramble of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
is not altogether a Dream, or if it be, it is neither
vain nor deluſory, but flew abroad through the right Gate.</p>
            <p>But the Letters tell us, that <hi>ſuppoſe there were never a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter
in the Land,</hi> thoſe Alterations ought to be made;
<hi>Minist.</hi> P. 27. <hi>to gratify our ſelves by further Improvements,
Amendments and Perfection.</hi> Let us then before we comply,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100336:8"/>
conſider a little of the State of Perfection into which theſe
Alterations would tranſlate us. Is it for our own ſake and
perfection that we ſhould leave the Croſs in Baptiſm, and
renounce the common badge of Chriſtianity, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the Univerſal Church? Is it for Perfection that
we ſhould lay aſide the Surplice for the ſhort Mantle?
Is it for the heightning and perfection of our Devotion,
that we ſhould chuſe to receive the Communion Standing
or Sitting, rather than upon our Knees? Is it for our own
ſake that we ſhould leave the old verſion of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi>
that has generally a plain and determined ſenſe, for the
new that affects too much of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Phraſe, and in
which the ſenſe in many places is ſuſpended? Is it for
greater Edification, to aſtoniſh our People with Reading
in our Churches all the hard names in the <hi>Chronicles, Ezra</hi>
and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> inſtead of the Books of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticus?</hi> If the <hi>Canticles</hi> are omitted, becauſe Interpreters
of that Miſterious Song are not ſo eaſily to be found as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
we have the practice of the Synagogue and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Church to juſtify us. But <hi>Tobit</hi> and his Dog are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable.
Give me leave for once to intercede for that
Poor Dog, becauſe he is a Dog of good example, for he was
faithful and loved his Maſter; beſides that, he never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
the Church on <hi>Sundays</hi> when People have their beſt
Cloaths on: only on a Week day, when Scrupulous Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
are always abſent, the poor Cur makes bold to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his Maſter.</p>
            <p>But after all, I would not be thought ſo fond of our
Liturgy, as to pronounce it beyond all improvement; yet
I muſt avow, that in my Judgment the Authors of the
Letters have not put us in the right way to perfection.
In the laſt place therefore, although many things in our
Church might receive improvement, if our Directors
had put us in the right way of retaining them; yet I muſt
declare that in my judgment, the preſent time is the moſt
improper to try the practice of any that has paſt ſince the
Reformation. Perfection is certainly a deſirable thing, yet
if Mens minds are averſe, and for the preſent uncapable,
if the times are unſeaſonable, if inconveniences appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100336:8"/>
from the experiment, Men may be excuſed if
they do not preſently run away with every project of good
appearance; and their ſhieneſs for medling with new
practices ought to be aſcribed rather to their tenderneſs
and godly jealouſy and miſtruſt of conſequences, than
as one of our Epiſtlers in his great charity is pleaſed to
judge to their <hi>peeviſhneſs, ſtiffneſs,</hi> or what is the hardeſt
charge of all their <hi>Wickedneſs.</hi> Nor, can I blame any
Men, who in hopes of Fairer Weather, think it adviſable
to lye ſhort, in compliance with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s rule, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 16.
<hi>Nevertheleſs whereto we have attained, let us walk by the ſame
rule, let us mind the ſame things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why is not this a time? <hi>not a Seaſon.</hi> Says the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<hi>is there any thing can make that not ſeaſonable which is
always a duty?</hi> I am ſorry all our Predeceſſors have died in
the mortal omiſſion of this indiſpenſible duty. But our
Miniſter ſuggeſts ſometimes, that they were ignorant and
knew no better: Here I muſt leave him to diſpute this
with his Friend the Author of the other Letter, who takes
upon him to juſtify our Forefathers for refuſing Alterations
in their time. Let it not diſpleaſe, if I cite a ſcrap of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi>
upon this occaſion, which never gave any offence before
this laſt Convocation; <hi>Vixerunt fortes ante Agamemnone,</hi>
—thus rendred by the Old Tranſlator.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Before his time the Fool maintains</l>
               <l>That Men were born without their Brains.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Is it not a Seaſon to remember the <hi>tenderneſs towards
Diſſenters,</hi> and the promiſe of <hi>coming to a temper</hi> in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
Petition? What have we to do with the Biſhops
Petition? were they not put in the Tower for it? Who
will concern himſelf with thoſe Forſaken Biſhops, whom
one of our Authors threatens with <hi>Annihilation;</hi> Poor Men,
<hi>that must be immediately cruſhed and fall to nothing,</hi> P. 25. But
I hope that without falling under the <hi>heavy reſentments of
the State,</hi> I may ask one Queſtion on the behalf of thoſe
Reverend Perſons againſt whom every Aſs is now lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up his Heels: Are our Directors ſure that they have
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100336:9"/>
in their Project of Alterations hit the <hi>temper</hi> promiſed by
the Biſhops? If a Project formed, I know not where nor
by whom, has not the fortune to be approved, muſt the
<hi>Clamour of the People be raiſed against the</hi> Biſhops, <hi>as a Baſe
Falſe ſort of Men, who can promiſe fair in times of Adverſity,
and forget all performances when they are over?</hi> I wiſh indeed
that the times of Adverſity were over with thoſe Good
Men, that they may be able to perform their Vows; but
there is one circumſtance of the time of the Petition gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
forgot. All the Penal Laws for the ſecurity of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> againſt Papiſts and other Diſſenters,
were then in full force; againſt theſe the Diſpenſing Power
was directed, and in the behalf of theſe the Biſhops did Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition;
but now all thoſe Laws as far as they concern the
Diſſenters in their private capacity are Repealed, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of the Diſſenters are not capable of any other <hi>temper</hi>
than Toleration, which they all have, and the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi>
who alone of all our Sects are capable of uniting with a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church, are ſo for from deſiring an accommodation,
that they are raiſing new Objections againſt Conformity,
and ſtanding off at greater diſtance than ever. Their very
ſitting ſtill at this time, without offering any Propoſals for
Union, while Churchmen are wrangling with one another
about giving them ſatisfaction, declares plainly that they are
reſolved to ſtick to their own way after all the Alterations
we ſhall be able to make. So that I do not ſee what thoſe
Biſhops, if their Authority were ſtill entire, could poſſibly
do further to make good the <hi>temper</hi> which they promiſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not a Seaſon?</hi> ſays the Miniſter; what, <hi>becauſe the Enemy
is withdrawn ſhall we devour one another,</hi> P. 27. This is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
an Eloquent vehemence, if I were worthy to reach the
ſenſe of it; <hi>devour one another!</hi> God bleſs us, we are not
ſuch Canabals ſure! I cannot deviſe how this ſhould come
in, unleſs it ſlipp'd from ſome Scripture Common-place-Book
made in the time of <hi>Vavaſor</hi> and <hi>Lunsford.</hi> But <hi>are
we yet without danger?</hi> Now becauſe <hi>the Man to his Friend</hi>
repreſents the dangers more ſenſibly, we'll take his Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<hi>We have a formidable Enemy in our Neighbourhood, who
thinks of nothing leſs than of ſubjugating theſe Three Kingdoms
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100336:9"/>
to his Abſolute Tyranny; his greateſt hopes for our deſtruction is
our Diviſions among our ſelves,—theſe make us unable to reſiſt
him with that ſucceſs,</hi> &amp;c. Is there any Propheſy I pray (for
it is not Civil to ask this Gentleman for Reaſon) that Duke
<hi>Schomberg</hi> cannot Reduce <hi>Ireland,</hi> unleſs the Croſs in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
be taken away? Or will not our Fleet engage the
<hi>French,</hi> except <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Ordinations made in defiance of
Biſhops and Epiſcopacy be allowed? Have the <hi>Quakers</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to Fight if we Reform the Kalendar? Or will not the
<hi>Independants</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians</hi> ſtrike one Stroke, but under
the Banner of the New Reformed Church of <hi>England,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
always it be not a Croſs? Is there no way of joining
in Fight, and Paying Taxes without this Church Union ſo
much talked of by us, and never ſo much as mentioned by
the Diſſenters? Indeed Sir, the Diſſenters are much to
blame, if after ſo ample Toleration, that as you obſerve
<hi>has put them upon as good a bottom of Legal Right and Protection
as the Church of</hi> England, they refuſe to aſſiſt the Government,
unleſs the poor defective <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> be put into a ſtate
of Perfection. This Church of <hi>England</hi> is certainly under the
Dominion of the moſt unfortunate of all the Planets, for
whoever miſcarries, ſhe muſt bear the Blame. If a Frigat be
caſt away, the Winds and the Sea, though ſubject to no
Actions in our Courts, are abſolved, and the faults layed
upon our Rigours, much harder than the Marble Rocks of
<hi>Plymouth.</hi> If a Diſeaſe in the Camp, render our Army un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for Action, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is the cauſe, becauſe
ſhe does not unite all Proteſtants: If a Commiſſary Victuals
not the Camp ſufficiently, and a <hi>French</hi> Apothecary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
not proper Drugs, O the lamentable <hi>Diviſions and
Diſtractions of the Church and State;</hi> and our Stiff Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
will never come to a healing temper. I have heard
ſome Learned Men ſay, that the Primitive Chriſtians were
in their time in the ſame office of Blame-beating that we
are now; if the <hi>Roman</hi> Arms wanted ſucceſs, ſome Oracle
ſpoke, Away with theſe Atheiſtical Chriſtians: If the
Year was unfruitful, Hang up the Chriſtians. Let the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
or the Moderate Men ſay what they pleaſe of Biſhops
and Liturgies and Ceremonies, this one thing at leaſt we may
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100336:10"/>
be allowed to have common with the Primitive Church,
I have almoſt filled up my ſheet though I write in ſhort
hand, and therefore cannot now give you my reaſons at
length, why I think this an unfit Time for Alterations, if any
at all were to be thought of. I will only hint them to you.
In the firſt place the Diſſenters do not ſeem to be in any
Diſpoſition to an Accommodation, having never made any
Propoſals either to the Commiſſioners or Convocation. 2. The
Condition they are in at preſent by the Act of Toleration
raiſes their expectations too high to be ſatisfied with any
reaſonable Terms. 3. The aboliſhing of Epiſcopacy by their
Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> may encourage them here to think of
ſuch matters as can never be the fruits of a Treaty, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
to dream of a ſecond Conqueſt. 4. Their inſolence in
all places ſince this Revolution declares them to be above the
humble Diſpenſation of an amicable Compoſure. 5. The
great men that influence them, will always think it their
intereſt to keep them ſeparate from the Church, for ſo they
will be moſt for their turn, and therefore will never ſuffer
them to joyn with us; or ſhould they come in, will always
keep them up as a ſeparate Party within the Church. 6. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of the moſt conſiderable among them have declared,
they will never think of treating, unleſs their Orders are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and then too they will inſiſt upon the Point of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy.
7. The Church of <hi>England</hi> Men do not ſeem to be
in a Diſpoſition for altering at this Time; for they find
themſelves inſulted and oppreſſed in all parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
where the moderate Men are got into Power and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.
8. The Clergy are alarmed with the Deſtruction
of Epiſcopacy in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and think they have reaſon to be
jealous, that now the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hold intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
with the <hi>Scots;</hi> becauſe they have always correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
9. Our Lay-men find Diſſenters even in this State of
Separation to have the Preference; and upon a new Model
they may have reaſon to ſuſpect, that the Proſelites may paſs
for the only Church-men, and then <hi>Veteres migrate Coloni.</hi>
10. There ſeems to want a Plenitude of Authority in the
Convocation, to enact theſe Alterations; the Archbiſhop of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Five of his Suffragans, Perſons of great Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100336:10"/>
and credit in the Church, lying at preſent under
an incapacity. The Objection about their Schiſm is nothing
but a Calumny of their Enemies, and ſhall have no Anſwer
from me, becauſe it is not agreeable to my temper to give
it ſuch an Anſwer as it deſerves: But certainly an Archbiſhop
the <hi>Praeſes natus</hi> of the Convocation, and Five Biſhops of the
Province muſt needs be miſſed in the Houſe, conſiſting of
but Two and Twenty. It is not enough to ſay that it is
a Legal Houſe without them; for a Houſe of Commons of
Forty Perſons is a Legal Houſe; but there would be great
exceptions, if Three times the number, and no more, ſhould
take upon them to Repeal a Statute, or alter common Law.
And in this Jealouſy that one Party has of another, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
odly, that this time of all others ſhould be thought
moſt proper to introduce Alterations of ſuch a conſequence
as theſe appear to be at the firſt view. 11. The Kingdom is
yet in ſuch a ferment, and many things ſo unſetled, that to
change now in the Church, is like altering Military Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
in the midſt of a Battle, or cavining a Ship in a Storm.
The moſt proper time for Alterations in Religion, is that
which is moſt calm, when the Spirits of Men run low, when
there is a mutual confidence between parties, when they all
conſpire in one deſire of accommodation, and when the
Eccleſiaſtical Authority that is to Enact them, is entire,
not only in reſpect of the Law, but of Common Opinion:
And whether theſe circumſtances belong to the preſent time,
you will eaſily diſcern.</p>
            <p>I will conclude with anſwering Two Arguments in
the Letters, which I had almoſt forgot; The Firſt is,
that <hi>if we do not make Alterations, moſt certainly the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will, and we may provoke them by our ſtiffneſs, to follow
the Example of</hi> Scotland. It is a ſtrange confidence, and
ſcarce of <hi>Engliſh</hi> growth, to declare ſo certainly before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
what our Parliament will do. Theſe Gentlemen will
pardon me, if I ſhould think the Parliament ſomething
wiſer than them, and cannot apprehend any thing from
them that may prove for the prejudice of the eſtabliſhed
Church, and to the diſſatisfaction of the generality of the
Kingdom: For the Example of <hi>Scotland,</hi> we deſpiſe the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100336:11"/>
Threatning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have read of an Owl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that appeared
in a <hi>Roman</hi> Councel and frighted the whole Aſſembly; but our
Church of <hi>England</hi> Convocations are not ſo eaſily ſcared.
This is the third Time that Epiſcopacy has been aboliſhed in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> we know it to have revived twice, and we ſtill
believe <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Argument is, that <hi>the King is deſirous of theſe
Alterations,</hi> and the Church of <hi>England</hi> cannot but be ſafe in
his hands. This is an Argument I muſt acknowledge my
ſelf to be unable to anſwer yet. I know, that the King's
Name and the King's Money are often uſed without his
knowledge; but becauſe I cannot reply directly, I will
plead the Priviledge of Old Age, and tell you a ſhort Story.
In the Beginning of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt's Reign, the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi>
of this Kingdom entertained violent hopes of an
Eccleſiaſtical Revolution, and gave out every where, that
the King having been bred in <hi>Scotland</hi> in the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
way, was deſirous of a change in favour of it: A great
Number of Conformiſts, and much a greater Number than
have yet appeared, for this new Project, joyned with the
Non conformiſts; defamed the Common-Prayer beyond
Meaſure; declared they could never ſubſcribe again, though
they had done it ſeveral Times before; You know the Iſſue,
they found themſelves miſtaken in the King's Inclinations,
the moderate Men were glad to be reconciled to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer,
and the Church outlived the too haſty Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
of her Enemies, and the Treachery of her preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Friends.</p>
