            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in the Banqueting roome at Whitehall,
On St. Stephens night last: At the Mariage
of the right Honourable the Earle of
Somerset, &amp; the right noble the
Lady Frances Howard.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N ancient times, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
any man sought to shadowe or
heighten his Inuention, he had
store of feyned persons readie
for his purpose; As <hi>Satyres,
Nymphes</hi> &amp; their like: such were
then in request and beliefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the vulgar. But in our dayes, although they
haue not vtterly lost their vse, yet finde they so litle
credit, that our moderne writers haue rather trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd
their fictions to the persons of Enchaunters &amp;
Commaunders of Spirits, as that excellent Poet
<hi>Torquato Tasso</hi> hath done, and many others.</p>
                  <p>In imitation of them (having a presentation in
hand for Persons of high State) I grounded my
whole Inuention vpon Inchauntmens and severall
transformations: The work-manship whereof was
<pb facs="tcp:7825:3"/>
vndertaken by M. <hi>Constantine</hi> an Italian, Architect to
our late Prince <hi>Henry:</hi> but he being too much of him
selfe, and no way to be drawne to impart his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
fayled so farre in the assurance he gaue, that
the mayne inuention euen at the last cast, was of
force drawne into a farre narrower compasse then
was from the beginning intended: The description
whereof as it was performed, I will as briefely as I
can deliver. The place wherein the Maske was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
being the Banquetting house at White Hall:
the vpper part, where the State is placed, was Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
with Pillars, Scaffolds, and all things answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the sides of the Roome. At the lower end of
the Hall before the Sceane was made an Arch Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vmphall,
passing beautifull, which enclosed the
whole Workes: The Sceane it selfe (the Curtaine
being drawne) was in this manner diuided.</p>
                  <p>On the vpper part there was formed a Skye with
Clowdes very arteficially shadowed. On either side
of the Sceane belowe was set a high Promontory,
and on either of them stood three large pillars of
golde: the one Promontory was bounded with a
Rocke standing in the Sea, the other with a Wood;
In the midst betwene them apeared a Sea in perspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue
with ships, some cunningly painted, some arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially
sayling. On the front of the Sceane, on either
side was a beautifull garden, with sixe seates a peece
to receaue the Maskers: behinde them the mayne
Land, and in the middest a paire of stayres made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
curiously in the forme of a Schalop shell.
<pb facs="tcp:7825:3"/>
And in this manner was the eye first of all entertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
After the King, Queene, and Prince were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and preparation was made for the beginning
of the Maske, there entred foure Squires, who as
soone as they approached neare the Presence, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
bowing themselues, spake as followeth.</p>

                  <p>When they had whispered a while as if they had
