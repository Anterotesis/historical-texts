            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the HONORABLE
The Knights, Citizens and Burgeſſes,
IN
PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>The Humble Petition of Robert Tayloe, Joſeph Emerſon, John Sawbridge and Edward
Pearce, on the behalf of themſelves and other Poor Marriners, to the Number of Five hundred
and upwards, who ſerved the Eaſt-India Company in their late Wars againſt the Great Mogul,
and other Heathen Princes: And on the behalf of the Widows and Orphans of other Marriners
to the like Number, that Periſhed in the ſaid Wars.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THAT the ſaid Company, in the Years 1683, 1684, 1685 and 1686. entered your Petitioners and
others, on Board ſeveral of their Ships, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Ships called <hi>The</hi> Charles <hi>the Second,</hi> the <hi>Beauford,</hi>
the <hi>Ceſar,</hi> the <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and other their Ships, to make direct Voyages to and from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi>
at very low Wages and Sallaries, in a Merchant-like way (there being then no Wars betwixt this Crown and
any other Princes or State in the World, nor did your Petitioners apprehend any War was like to be between
this Crown and any the ſaid Princes.</p>
            <p>That in ſome ſhort time after your Petitioners Arrival in the <hi>Indies,</hi> the ſaid Companies Agents and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
there, ingaged their ſaid Ships in an Actual War againſt the ſaid <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> and other Heathen
Princes; and by exceſſive Tortures, as Nailing their Hands to the Main-maſt, Whipping, and waſhing their
Wounds in Brine, and other great Torments, the Commanders of the ſaid Ships compelled your Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners,
againſt their Wills, and contrary to the Statute made 5 <hi>Eliz. chap.</hi> 5. to ſerve in the ſaid Companies
Wars, againſt the ſaid Heathen Princes, upon their Land, in Parts very remote from any Sea, and to make
Depredations without any Juſt Cauſe (as your Petitioners could underſtand) and Robbing the Subjects of the
ſaid Heathen Princes to a very great Value.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid Commanders, Agents and Governors, finding the ſaid Ill Uſage of your Petitioners not to
take its full Effect according to their Expectation, the ſaid Governors cauſed an Order to be made in their
Court of Admiralty held in the ſaid <hi>Indies,</hi> that your Petitioners ſhould have (over and beſides their low
Wages) a Sixth part of all Prizes, to be divided amongſt them, and the ſame Order to be publiſhed on ſome
of the ſaid Ships, and to be affixed to the Main-maſts of the ſame Ships, to make the ſame more publick, and to
encourage your Petitioners to Fight for them; which your Petitioners accordingly did. That during the ſaid
War, there was taken, by your Petitioners, in Prizes, to the value of 1500000<hi>l.</hi> and upwards, which is proved
in the Court of Exchequer, in a Suit there brought, and now depending, for their Majeſties Tenths of the ſaid
Prizes, of which 260000<hi>l.</hi> belongs to your Petitioners for their Sixth part, due to them not only by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
as aforeſaid, but Laws of Nations; and ſo by the ſaid Company confeſs'd, in their Anſwer in the ſaid
Court in the ſaid Suit, and accordingly have paid ſome Marriners their Proportions.</p>
            <p>That whilſt your Petitioners were in the <hi>Indies,</hi> your Petitioners were neceſſitated to accept from the ſaid
Commanders and Agents, Dollers at 9 <hi>s.</hi> a piece, the prime Coſt in <hi>England</hi> was not above 4 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> and
Rack at 12 <hi>s. per</hi> Gallon, the prime Coſt not above 9 <hi>d. per</hi> Gallon, and Brandy at 18 <hi>s. per</hi> Gallon, by which
means all your Petitioners Wages, and more, was expended, and many Marriners, more than by the ſaid
Wars, periſhed for want of ſuch Commodities.</p>
            <p>That your Petitioners have applied themſelves from time to time to the ſaid Company for the ſaid
Share, or what ſhould appear due to them, upon a Juſt Dividend thereof to be made, and for their Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance
thereof, your Petitioners, the laſt Seſſions of Parliament, were about to Addreſs themſelves to
this Honorable Houſe for Relief therein; whereupon a worthy Member of his Honorable Houſe, then
Governor of the ſaid Company, having notice, promiſed your Petitioners Satisfaction if your Petitioners
would forbear their ſaid Addreſs; which Promiſe your Petitioners relying upon, did accordingly forbear,
but hitherto cannot get any manner of Satisfaction, and in want thereof, are grown ſo Neceſſitous, that
many are forced to be relieved by their reſpective Pariſhes wherein they reſpectively live.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as this Honorable Houſe hath ordered the ſaid Company to bring in their Books, and a
State of their Debts and Credits; your ſaid Poor Petitioners do humbly Hope and Pray, that this Honorable
Houſe will take notice, that your Petitioners may have Credit upon the ſaid Companies Books for the ſaid
Summ ſo due and owing to your Petitioners, in order that they may have Satisfaction for the ſame, for
that the ſaid Prizes have been converted to the Uſe and Benefit of the ſaid Company; And to afford ſuch
further Relief to your Petitioners, as to this Honorable Houſe ſhall ſeem fit.</p>
            <closer>And your Petitioners (as in Duty bound) ſhall ever Pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
