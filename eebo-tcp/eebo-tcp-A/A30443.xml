            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 COR. i. 26.</bibl>
               <q>For ye see your Calling, Brethren, how
that not many Wise after the Flesh,
not many Mighty, not many Noble
are called.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT was one of the earliest, and is like to be
one of the most lasting Prejudices against the
Christian Religion, that few of those who have
been under eminent Distinctions in the World,
have sincerely gone into its Precepts and Discipline:
many have indeed gone into its Interests, when they
found their own in them, who have been much
above the common Level; but these have lived so
little like their Profession, that they have become a
Reproach to it: and what they seemed to build up
with one Hand, was more than defaced with the
other: while the World, by comparing their Zeal
with their Morals, have been led to collect, that they
themselves did not believe that Religion, about whose
Concerns they seemed to be so warm and active.
But when it has been observed, that those few upon
whose Tempers and Actions this Religion seemed
to have a more real and a more powerful Influence,
have been for the greater part Men of a lower size
of Mind and Fortune, many have from thence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65707:5"/>
framed to themselves the most mischievous Idea possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of our <hi>most holy Faith,</hi> that its Votaries were
either apt to deceive or be deceived; in plain English,
either Knaves or Fools. This the Jews began and
charged our Saviour with it, that none of the
Doctors,<note place="margin">Joh. 7. 48, 49.</note> 
               <hi>the Rulers, or the Pharisees had believed on
him;</hi> and that the Rabble who followed him, were
<hi>People who knew not the Law, and were accursed.</hi> The
Philosophers when they heard St. <hi>Paul</hi> preach, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
him a <hi>Babler,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 17. 18, 32.</note> and his Doctrine foolish: and
whereas they thought that none were capable of true
Philosophy, that is (in the sense of those Ages) of
true Notions concerning God and Morality, but Men
happily born and duly prepared; they were amaz'd,
when they saw Multitudes of all Ages and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and of both Sexes, imbrace this Doctrine, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
so firmly to it, and die so resolutely for it; that
whereas a generous Contempt of Life, and a Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against the Terrors of Death, had been esteemed
the greatest Indication of the Courage of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
or the Philosophy of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the Christians
came to be marked with this Character, not only
by the profane <hi>Lucian,</hi> but by a much better Man,
<hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> as too regardless and prodigal of
Life: yet still the World stuck to that as to a just
Prejudice, that those who embraced this Doctrine
were mean and illiterate Men, who having little to
lose in this World, were the more easily prevailed
on to despise it, and to hearken after the hopes of
another; and to embrace a Doctrine that offered
its Proselytes many Privileges beyond the rest of
Mankind. And since mean Mens Minds are often
as low as their Fortunes, and poor and weak People
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65707:5"/>
are more apt to be imposed on, and less capable of
making strict Enquiries into the truth of Things;
all this seems to give a fair and reasonable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
against a Religion, whose first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
were neither the Learned <hi>Rabbins,</hi> nor the
Subtile <hi>Philosophers,</hi> neither Men of Authority nor
Birth.</p>
            <p>Somewhat like the same Observation is still made,
if not of the Nominal Christians of our days, for
now all are such, yet of those, of whom one has the
justest reason to conclude, that they are in earnest
with their Religion, that they are neither of the
highest size for Parts, Quality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Power; but are
more commonly Persons of a moderate Proportion, as
to all these things. This seems to afford a very proper
Subject for a Discourse of this kind, to consider and
discuss the Truth and the Consequences that may
arise out of this Prejudice, and that both with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Beginnings of Christianity, and to the
present State in which we find it to be among our
selves.</p>
            <p>I need not amuse you long with explaining the
words of my Text. By <hi>Calling,</hi> is meant their Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Christian Religion, not in that general
sense,<note place="margin">Mat. 20. 16.</note> in which it is said that <hi>many are called:</hi> which
imports, only that the Gospel was to be preached to
<hi>many;</hi> but in a more restricted sense, in which it is
used promiscuously with <hi>Election,</hi> so we are required
<hi>to make our Calling and Election sure:</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. 10.</note> that is, our
being gathered together by the Call of the Gospel
into a Body distinct and separated from the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
By this then is to be understood that Vocation, by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65707:6"/>
which Christians, as they are called on by the Gospel,
so they do hearken to it, and follow it. By the <hi>wise
after the Flesh,</hi> may be well meant Men of Worldly
Prudence, Skill and Dexterity in the ordering their
Affairs, or in the Conduct of the World: but the
common Acceptation of this word used among the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> and in this Epistle, relates to those Men of
Speculation and Knowledg, of Subtilty and Dispute,
known by the Names of <hi>Sophists</hi> and <hi>Philosophers.</hi>
By <hi>Mighty</hi> are to be understood the Men of Power
and Authority, Princes and Magistrates. By <hi>Noble,</hi>
are meant Men of high Birth and great Blood: So
the Importance of my Text is this, <q>You Christians
of <hi>Corinth,</hi> see that among you, who have imbraced
the Christian Religion, there are not many (some
few there might be) either Philosophers, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
or Men of Noble Extraction: but on the
contrary, you see that your Assemblies are made
up of Persons that are weak and despised, that are
of no Account or Esteem in the World.</q> And of
this the Apostle is so little ashamed, and so little dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to deny, hide or extenuate it, that he enlarges
upon it in a variety of several very full Expressions;
he calls them not only <hi>foolish</hi> and <hi>weak, base</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,</hi>
but <hi>things that are not;</hi> as low a Figure as Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
is capable of; and draws from it two very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Reflections, <hi>That no Flesh should glory in God's
Presence; but that he that glorieth, should glory in the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In speaking to these words, I shall consider,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65707:6"/>
               <list>
                  <item>I. What reason there was for such Reflections in the
days of the Apostles, and how came it that their
Converts were not of the upper, but of the
lower Ranks of Men?</item>
                  <item>II. What reason there may be for the like Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the present Age?</item>
                  <item>III. Whether this is a just Prejudice against the
Christian Religion or not?</item>
                  <item>IV. That all this belongs only to the greater part,
<hi>the many;</hi> and that it is not universally, tho it be
generally true. And,</item>
                  <item>V. What are the proper Inferences to be drawn
from all this?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>To the first;</p>
            <p>It is very true that the first Converts to Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
were for the most part weak and mean Men:
The Arguments which did then enforce this Religion,
were such, that the lowest Capacity could judg of
them. Miracles were wrought in the sight of great
Multitudes, and that in signal Instances, of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Cures done with a Word, of raising some from
the Dead, and speaking the Language of every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
into which those Preachers came, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any previous Preparation, or time lost in acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
it. These were things that bare Observation,
bare Seeing or Hearing, could discover to any, that
would look into them: they required no Strength
of Apprehension, nor Niceness of Judging. Men
of a higher Form are naturally more apt to despise
all such things, and to shut them out by forming a
previous Disbelief of them; and setting that up as a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65707:7"/>
Bar against all Conviction; which Men of a more
moderate size are more willing to ask after, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into: So that for the great Argument then
given in behalf of our Religion, every Man was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of seeing it's Truth: and when these mighty
Works confirmed such a Narrative concerning the
Death and the Resurrection of Christ, together with
such a holy Rule of Life and of Morals; every honest
Man was capable of judging, at least for himself, that
such a Recital with such a Scheme of Divine Morals
so well attested, could come from none but the great
and good God. It was also sutable to the miraculous
Vouchers that accompanied this Doctrine, that the
first Bodies of Men who were converted to it, should
consist chiefly of such Persons, that no Suspicion
could be against them, as if they by the Strength
of their Parts and Skill, by the Credit they were in,
or the Authority that they had, might have procured
to this Doctrine any part of the Reception that it met
with in the World. Had either the Tricks of Dispute,
the Charms of Eloquence, or the Dexterity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
appeared among the first Planters of this Faith;
had they been fortified with Power, or supported by
Dependencies, then the Progress of it might have been
accounted for: but when Numbers both of Jews and
Gentiles, and those Greeks as well as Barbarians, that
is, Learned and Unlearned, forsook the Religions in
which they had been bred, and to which they were
tied by all the Prejudices that could possibly lock them
up fast in the way in which they had been brought up;
and when they not only embraced it upon the Credit
of what they saw and heard, and reformed their
Lives according to it, but stood to it in spite of all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65707:7"/>
the ill Usage and Persecution that it brought upon
them, so that many of them died for it, and all suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
more or less by reason of it, it must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that this was a very extraordinary and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
thing. The vast Increase and Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Religion under all those Disadvantages,
and with no visible human Help at all, was so asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,
that as all the first Apologists for Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
appealed often to it, as to one of the most sensible
Arguments, so it had been capable of an Answer that
had taken off much from its Strength, if it could
have been said that the Progress it made, was in
some degree owing to the Abilities or Interests of
those who first embraced it. Therefore as the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
upon which its Credit at first was built, were
such that the meanest Capacities were capable of
passing a Judgment upon them; so their being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all human Supports was an evident Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Divine ones that attended upon them.
And thus the first Branch of this Prejudice is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
accounted for.</p>
            <p>I go now to the second Particular, to examine what
Reasons there may be for the like Reflections in the
present Age. Alas, it is but too visible! that tho now
whole Nations are become Christians by the lump,
yet there are few, very few real Christians to be found
among all those Assemblies that are crowded full with
those who carry that worthy Name. There are few
the Tenor and Thread of whose Lives speaks them to
be Men that deny Ungodliness and Worldly Lusts,
and that live godly, righteously and soberly, like Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
on Earth, having their Hearts and Affections in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65707:8"/>
Heaven; that are pure and holy, meek and lowly
in Heart in imitation of their great Master, whom
the far greater part of those who are called Christians,
dishonour with their Lives while they offer up to him
the outward Shews and Pageants of Honour and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
Among those few (few they are God knows)
there are not many who have great Advantages in this
World, either with respect to their Talents, or to
their Fortunes.</p>
            <p>Those who have a greater compass of Knowledg,
more flame of Thought, and elevation of Mind, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
turn and imploy it wholly to base and mean Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
to the close Contrivances of Dissimulation and
Falshood, or to a loose and libertine Gaity; valuing
themselves upon some sparkling Thoughts, which are
directed to the questioning or laughing at the most
serious and sacred Matters; which by a profane Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mickry
they represent as ridiculous, both to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and others. These are the too common Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
that hang about many of those who yet seem
to be born with somewhat that is sublime in them:
Men of a greater Depth in Study, as well as of more
Gravity of Temper, feeling that their Thoughts have
a higher Flight, and a greater Extent than others
about them are perhaps capable of, do swell often up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that, and grow to value themselves as much beyond
what they deserve, as they undervalue others below
what is due to them: These, if sullen and ill-bred,
shew their Pride in Scorn and insolent Behaviour; or
if, by a due Commerce with the World, their Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is more decent, yet inwardly they are full of an
Admiration of themselves, and of a Contempt of all
other Persons: they are apt to be singular in their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65707:8"/>
Thoughts, and fond of their own Notions; they love
Novelties, and delight to see whole Bodies of Men
called by their Name: they form to themselves Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
against the believing any thing upon the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of others; especially if the Matters proposed
to them are of a pitch above their Apprehensions.
Men of Knowledg and Parts are subject to one or more
of these ill Qualities, which do so much vitiate their
Understandings, and corrupt their Natures, that they
cannot come under a Discipline, whose first Elements
are Humility, Modesty, a due Distrust of one's self,
and a charitable Esteem of other Men: they have
not treatable Understandings, that can diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and lay things slowly and attentively together;
they neither examine the first Principles, nor the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections
of things: So that their Hearts and Heads are
not capable of that ply of Mind, which is a necessary
Preparation to the being a true Christian.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Mighty</hi> Men, if they are of a lower
Form, their Thoughts turn much to Avarice and
Corruption, to Partiality and Injustice, and to Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and Rage; if they are at the top of Human
Nature, in high Power and Authority, they are apt
to extend that, either to an undue Domination over
those who are subject to them, or to an unjust En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement
of Empire. Unlawful Wars and Conquests
look great, and sound big: if they are successful in
them, and flattered for them, they are enchanted with
a false Opinion of their own <hi>Glory,</hi> so that neither the
Blood that is shed, nor the Miseries that are occasioned
by them, are able to disturb that Imaginary Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
with which they seem to be at present so much
delighted. Men thus turned and so vitiated are not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65707:9"/>
capable to apprehend themselves to be under the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
to Justice and Compassion, to Truth and
Fidelity, to Moderation of their Desires, and to the
restoring what they have injustly taken, or do as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
detain from other Men. If a Zeal for some of
the Interests or Passions of a Party in Religion; if
Cost and Magnificence, Solemnity and Cruelty in the
Cause of a Church, will buy off greater Obligations,
or pay for the most Criminal Violations of all that
is just and sacred among Men, then they will perhaps
purchase a Name at that rate, as well as pay those
who flatter them on that account. It is then very
true, that the Men of Power and Authority are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
such a Biass and so many Temptations, that it is
scarce to be hoped for, that <hi>many</hi> of them shall come
within this high and holy Calling.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Noble,</hi> the Men of Extraction and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent,
of high Blood and antient Families, they are
often so much mollified and broken by a soft and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Education, they are so enervated by Luxury, and
so dissolved into Idleness and Voluptuousness, that
they are as little capable of coming under this Yoke,
as either of the former were found to be. The Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
to which they were born, and in which they
have always lived, seems to set them beyond the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of imploying their Thoughts and Time in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
or useful Studies and Exercises: They are steeped
in Laziness, and over-run with fierce and craving
Appetites. Pleasure sways and turns them, it consumes
their Time, and exhausts both Bodies and Minds: a
Restraint of Excess and Riot, and a Limitation of
Appetite, are Doctrines they cannot submit to; but
think their Liberties ought to be as unbounded as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65707:9"/>
their Desires are. The ill Example they see, and the
bad Company they keep, meet little Resistance from
them, and do soon conquer Minds so little disciplined
or cultivated.</p>
            <p>And thus it is not to be denied, but that the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
which the Christian Doctrine gives to those
Corruptions, that do but too easily beset the <hi>Wise,</hi> the
<hi>Mighty,</hi> and the <hi>Noble,</hi> makes that few of them can
conquer themselves, and break thrô those ill Habits
and Dispositions of Mind, that do as it were belong to
their Condition and Circumstances; and by so doing
become true Christians. Common Observation is so
full of this, that I will not go about to prove it: I
wish I were mistaken, and out in my account: The
thing is but too visible and crying; and the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are too publick and scandalous: Men glory too
much in them, to be either ashamed of them, or
willing to forsake them. While on the other hand,
the few Men of Vertue and Probity, of Morality
and true Piety, are for the most part Men of a lower
size, whose honest Tempers and good Nature, do
more than ballance those seeming Defects in Vivacity
and Knowledg; they are Men of a middle size, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
contemptible for their Folly, nor of a sublime
Exaltation; Men of moderate Fortunes as well as
Desires; who are neither depressed with Poverty,
nor exalted with Wealth, are generally the most ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Justice and Honesty, of Industry and a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Contentedness with their Condition; and those
who are neither high nor low, neither blown up nor
sunk with their Fortunes, are generally the best fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the Precepts of Religion. As for those who
are placed in the Extreams of Fortune; certainly
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65707:10"/>
tho the lowest have their Temptations as well as the
greatest, yet of the two, they are by their Condition
much more disposed to Religion, they are less dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
and more alone, they have more occasion both
to fear bad Accidents, and to be devout under
them; and the mean Condition to which they seem
to be doomed in this Life, may very naturally dispose
them to try to have it better'd in another World. So
far I have gone on the second Head.</p>
            <p>The third is, Whether this is a just Prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Christian Religion or not? At first view it
looks as if the Truth of our Faith appeared very
doubtfully, and could not bear a strict Enquiry, that
howsoever weaker Minds might be overcome, yet it
could not stand the Test before Men of more search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Understandings. It looks also ill that it seems
incompatible with Authority and Dignity, as if it were
a mean and dispiriting Doctrine, suted only to Men
of abject Minds and broken Fortunes, and a proper
Theory for the Unfortunate to take Sanctuary in. It
is true, we have already considered and agreed this
matter, that there is somewhat in most of the <hi>Wise,</hi>
the <hi>Mighty,</hi> and the <hi>Noble,</hi> which bars out this
Discipline, they are not fitted to it, nor it to them.
But after all, if this Indisposition arises not from any
Opposition between Religion and their Faculties, or
Circumstances, but only from the Contradiction it
gives to some bad and vicious Qualities that are in
the Persons here described, then it can furnish us
with no just or well-grounded Prejudices against the
Christian Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:65707:10"/>
That Humility and Modesty, a due distrust of
our selves, and regard to others, that Application
and Industry, are necessary Dispositions to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
our Faculties, is that which few can deny.
What is true Breeding, among the civilized, but
the putting on the appearances of Modesty and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility?
And if the appearances of these things are
so Beautiful, and that Youth is formed in them with
so much Care, how much more valuable must these
things be? When they are the genuine and natural
growth of our Minds; When they are not only
counterfeit and mimickry, but the product of Hearts
duly seasoned and well principled. How rough
and boisterous a thing is Pride and a haughtiness
of Temper and Behaviour? How unkind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neighbourly
a thing is the contempt of other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Understandings? And how unseemly and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
is it for a Man to Dictate and to be Imperious?
It is a sign of a trifling Mind to affect to Doubt,
when all the just Reasons of Doubting are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
cleared. And nothing shews a Man to be
more a stranger to himself, and to the natural De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of his Faculties, than to imagine that all things
may fall well within the compass of his Thoughts:
Nor is there any thing more contrary to the true
Methods of arriving at Knowledge, than for Men
after a slight view of things, to form Difficulties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and to heighten these with Similes that tend to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them ridiculous, and then to season all with
Laughter and Scorn: and to take no further Care
of being better informed about them. That these
are Defects and Disorders, even in a wise Man,
common Observation does justifie. But if a Man
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65707:11"/>
will study to free himself from them, and take some
Pains to adjust the Balance, that is to bring his
Understanding to a due fixedness and attention, to
consider well, and to pronounce slowly: And to
have the Scales made equal, that is to have no Biass
in him, or Weight from bad Inclinations in the
Scale opposite to Religion, then let him consider
the Matter as if he were in a Jury, for his own
Life or Death turns upon the Verdict, and then let
him give Sentence: Before such a Judgment, so
well poised and so duly made, there is no reason
to fear the Cause of the Christian Religion.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>mighty</hi> are prejudiced against Religion, it
is by reason of those ill qualities that commonly
creep upon the Men of Power. Justice and Equity
do very often lie in the way of a present Interest.
Impartial Proceedings require Impartial Minds.
The thoughts of a Judgment to come, must be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unacceptable to him that perverts Judgment and
Justice. He who is not content with what he hath,
cannot be easie while he sees that his Neighbour
has more than himself: Or that he has that which
would very much accommodate himself, and which
he might come at, if it were not for such an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
Rule as is that of <hi>doing as one would be
done by.</hi> He who has been successful in his Injustice
and Violence, cannot easily receive a Doctrine which
brings him under indispensable Obligations of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
all that he has unjustly acquired. The Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of Guilt, the Tears of the Oppressed, and the
cry of Blood that pursues them, would arise too
fast, and be heard too sensibly by them, if they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
such a secret Monitor as true Religion would
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65707:11"/>
prove to them. When <hi>Felix</hi> heard the Doctrines
of <hi>Temperance, Iustice, and a Iudgment to come, he
trembled</hi> indeed, but yet he sent away the Preacher,
putting him off to <hi>a more convenient time.</hi> And
whereas no Man is in danger to be much corrupted
by the Flatteries of others, till he has accustomed
himself to such kind Thoughts of his own supposed
Worth, that he easily believes that all others are as
favourable to him as he himself is, the severe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
that will arise out of this Holy Doctrine
will soon take off the Visar, and make him see him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his own Deformity, and that perhaps in the
most odious appearances. In a word, unless this
Man of Power and Dominion, can free his Mind
from the false Notions he has of his own <hi>Glory</hi> and
Authority, he cannot receive the Christian Religion,
but with great aversion, since his Nature and his
Habits are so totally opposite to its chief Tendency
and Design. Yet this arises not from any Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
that it has to the true Ends of Power and
Government, as if these were incompatible, but
from those ill qualities which do so generally vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
the Taste, and corrupt the Tempers of the
great and <hi>mighty</hi> Men.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Noble,</hi> if the Humility enjoined in the
Gospel obliged them to meannesses, unbecoming
their Rank, or if that Awe and Fear which arises
out of Religious Principles, did sink Mens Spirits,
or depress their Courage, here were a very colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Pretence: But when this Humility consists
chiefly in a modesty of Temper, and a readiness to
do good Offices, even to the meanest; what harm
can this do to the Men of the greatest Advantages
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65707:12"/>
for Birth and Rank? In the performing these Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
there is a natural Decency and Suitableness,
agreeable to the Order that must be maintained in
the World. Persons of the highest Form, when
they hear the just Complaints of the miserable, and
the oppressed, with Patience and Pity, and take
care that they be relieved, do the Humilities of their
Rank as much as those of a lower Order, that visit
the Sick, or serve Hospitals and Prisons. And since
the Fear with which Christianity inspires, does on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
work on the Guilty, it is their Guilt, and not our
Doctrine, which gives the disquiet. But, on the
other hand, nothing gives such an exalted Courage,
and so true a contempt of Death, as the prospect
of another State, with the just assurances of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of God, and of endless Happiness. Nor does
any thing make a Man so firm against Accidents
and Misfortunes, as the Belief of Providence; and
nothing raises a Man to a truer Generosity, and a
greater nobleness of Mind, than the contempt of
Wealth, and that extent of Charity which our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
enjoyns. But if the <hi>Noble</hi> of this World get
into the Habits of Voluptuousness and Sensuality,
if they think it becomes their Dignity to give a loose
range to Appetite, and to be as Publick and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for their Irregularities, as they are by the Rank
they hold, if they cannot submit to the drudgery
of Instruction, and Knowledge, nor to such Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as are truly Manly and Useful to the Age, if
they think that Laziness and Luxury, Sloth and
Idleness belong to them as Appendages of their
Birth; if because they need be at no Pains to help
to support themselves, they think they owe nothing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65707:12"/>
to Humane Nature, or to their Country, and if
the little Submissions to which they are accustomed
within Doors, make them Insolent and Insufferable
to all abroad, then it is from those vicious Habits
that their dislike of our Religion does arise. It is
from the undisciplined wildness of their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and the neglected Methods of their Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that this flows. <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>Iohn</hi> gladly, but
could not part with <hi>Herodias:</hi> And somewhat like
this, made that <hi>Agrippa</hi> went no further than to be
<hi>almost a Christian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So now, I hope, it is abundantly clear, That the
too common opposition that is between the <hi>Wise,</hi>
the <hi>Mighty,</hi> and the <hi>Noble,</hi> and the Precepts and
Rules of the Christian Religion, arises not from
any thing that is justly exceptionable in it, but from
a great many qualities and dispositions that hang
about those Orders and Ranks of Men, which
make that they cannot bear a Yoke that is so
hard to them: They can neither resolve on changing
those Dispositions, nor of suffering a set of Thoughts
to break in upon them, that will make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie
in them, and give them much trouble for them:
And if it is Visible, as I hope it is, that all those
habits are in their nature and effects, hurtful both
to those who are over-run with them, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the
rest of Mankind, then all this is so far from being
a just prejudice against the Christian Religion, that
it tends rather to recommend it the more: Since
those who are the most averse to it, are so, only
by reason of the prevalency of some very bad Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
and Customs; which the Interest of the whole
World does require, that Men should be cured and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65707:13"/>
freed from. And this appears more evident by
considering the fourth Particular, which is,</p>
            <p>4. That all this belongs only to the greater
part <hi>the many,</hi> but that it is not constantly nor
Universally true. We have seen what a Powerful
Biass the Orders of Men specified in the Text are
under, as to the Christian Religion: But we are
now to consider the Abatements that are to be made
in this Point. In Fact we find a <hi>Nicodemus</hi> and a
<hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> among the first who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
our Saviour; tho' they were both of the
<hi>Sanhedrin</hi> the chief Judicature, and indeed the Head
of the Jewish State. We see <hi>Gamaliel</hi> was not far from
it, besides several <hi>Rulers</hi> of <hi>Synagogues,</hi> who were
always Men of distinction in the Neighbourhood;
we find also one of the <hi>Iudges</hi> of <hi>Areopagus,</hi> the
most Celebrated Court in <hi>Greece,</hi> and one of the
Roman <hi>Deputies,</hi> among the first Converts to our
Faith. St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself was a Master of the Jewish
Learning, and acquainted with the Greek Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
and Poets. We find some of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
were not only Christians but <hi>Martyrs:</hi> Many
of the Philosophers and the most admired Orators
of <hi>Greece,</hi> came afterwards to receive and defend
this Faith: And now in a course of a great many
Ages, Men in all respects, eminent both for Sense
and Learning, Wit and Eloquence, have not only
made outward Profession of this Doctrine, but have
strenously defended it, and which is yet more, have
conformed their own Lives to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:65707:13"/>
If we will judge a little of this Matter by the Bulk,
we must confess, that where the Light of this Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
shines, even in colder Climates, less productive
of Men of Genius, yet there is a more general
Knowledge spread among Nations that were dull
and barbarous, while under the Power of other
Religions, than is to be found in Provinces of a
much vaster extent, that live in a purer Air, a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
Soil, and under a kinder aspect of the Heavens.
I need not observe, what a Darkness is spread over
all the <hi>Pagan</hi> Nations, how most of them are sunk
even below Humane Nature, and how little the
<hi>Mahometans</hi> rise above them; bating their Freedom
from Idolatry. <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> the two most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
Scenes of Paganism, had Notions of their
Gods and Religion, which the wiser Men among
themselves could hardly endure, and which they
have sufficiently exposed. The good Laws, under
which all States are brought which acknowledge
this Doctrine in its purity, produce an unspeakable
Change on the outward face and appearances of
things: which tho' it does not reform Men inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
yet it proves a great Blessing to humane Society,
and the cultivation of all Arts and Sciences, that
accompanies this happy Light, shews, that it awakens
Mens Faculties, excites their Thoughts, and quickens
their Industry. All other Religions feed so much
Superstition, that it tends to Barbarity: and tho'
under some happy Reigns and great Princes we
find good Sense and true Knowledge sometimes in
the Ascendant: Yet this went soon off, it is not
the natural growth of such a Religion, and cannot
thrive long in that Soil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:65707:14"/>
Thus upon the whole Matter, this our Doctrine
is <hi>Light,</hi> and it illuminates Mankind in gross: And
some even of the sublimest Minds, that Ages and
Nations have produced, the Men of the liveliest
Thoughts, truest Judgments, and most piercing Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,
that have gone the deepest into Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and have seen the furthest into Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
have not only undertaken and managed the
Cause of Religion with great Advantages, but have
recommended it more by their own unblemished
and exemplary Lives, than can possibly be done
by the most laboured Writings, and the most mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Persuasions. They have expressed a genuine
Humility, an unaffected contempt of the Pleasures
and Interests of this Life: They have been pure
without spot, grave and sober, yet neither sullen
nor ill-natured: They have been serious without Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
and devout without Superstition: And have
shewed that Wit could be lively without being Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and that one may be cheerful without being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
or Scurrilous. Now I would gladly know, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any such whom you may have known, and I hope
you may have known many of them, have not been
more Beneficial to Mankind, have not been greater
Blessings in their Families and Neighbourhoods, and
if their Knowledge set off with their Modesty and
Humility, has not looked full as well about them,
as the highest Pretenders to Wit and unsanctified
Vivacity. The Presumption of the latter, takes off
from the true Value that does perhaps belong to
them: Whereas the former have nothing that is
troublesome and offensive, with all that is useful
in Knowledge: They can feel that they know more
than others, without either despising them or
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65707:14"/>
offering to impose upon them: they can be supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
to others, without Insolence, and Conquer
without Scorn. In such Persons, knowledge does
both shine and triumph, and is equally useful and
amiable. None are hurt but such Mens Wit, and
many are the better by their means. The temper
that Religion inspires them with does really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
their Capacities, it fixes their attention, and
composes their Minds: and as the Revelation of
this Doctrine has brought a great deal to Light,
which the World could never have thought on
without it, so the excellent disposition under which
Men are brought by it, puts them in a good way,
to improve those Seeds, and to increase them.</p>
            <p>But as some of the <hi>disputers of this World,</hi> the Wise
and the Learned, have been great Ornaments to
this Religion, as well as they have been much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
by it, so some Men of <hi>Power</hi> and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
have come under the standarts of the Crosse:
they have owned their <hi>Power</hi> to be derived from
him who is <hi>King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</hi> They
have not only taken on the Profession of this Faith,
but have established and conformed it by Laws: they
have imployed their Power to protect and encourage
Virtue and Justice: they have studyed the common
good of Societies and the true Interest Mankind.
Some Princes and Magistrates, I am sorry that I
must only say some, but some they have been whose
Exemplary lives have been Patterns to one great part
of mankind, and Reproaches to the rest. They have
been raised above the World, only to let others see,
to what a height of vertue, and to what an exactness
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65707:15"/>
of Deportment, to what a nobleness of Temper, and
purity of Morals humane Nature may be exalted; and
remain untainted under all the smiles of Fortune, and
the flateries of the obsequious. Some have reckon'd it
the end of their Power, to promote Justice, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Rapine, to encourage Vertue, and put Vice
out of countenance, and to pursue the common
Good of the whole Society, as well as the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
happiness of every deserving Person in it; and
have reckoned no part of their time better imployed,
and more to their own content, than that which
has been applyed to consider the miseries, and to
procure the happiness of their People. They have
easily admitted and patiently heard the groans of the
helpless and oppressed, and have thought it no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
nor disturbance of their own happy tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
to enter into and feel the sufferings of others, with
a tenderness that becomes those who are called, and
ought to be the <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Guardians</hi> of their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
When such blessings happen to any Age, how
sensibly do all Men feel it? This softens the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Unfortunate, which grow the lighter
to them, if they who are so far exalted above them
seem to afford them but one tender look or thought.
It gives a reserve of hope for the Prosperous, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the Calamities that may happen to them,
with a less dreadful prospect when they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
themselves supplies in Reversion to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
abundance. Now let every Man consider and
pronounce, whither Men so made, do not become
their power better, and if their power is not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of much realler blessings to mankind,
more benigne and beneficial than all that glitter, all
the shews of Glory and affectations of Greatness,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65707:15"/>
in the Men of Dominion, the mighty Potentates
and Conquerours, those plagues of Heaven and
scourges of the Earth.</p>
            <p>And as for the <hi>3d</hi> and last rank, of the <hi>Noble,</hi> it
cannot be denied neither, but how general soever
the corruption of that sort of Men has been spread,
yet that this admits of exceptions. Some of high
Birth have delighted to distinguish themselves, by
their Generosity and Bounty, by their Sobriety and
Temperance, by their Affability and sweetness of
Temper. Some have passed their lives in Courts
and Camps, how little soever these may seem
Schools of Vertue, so exactly, that neither the censures
of the envious, nor the Calumnies of the malicious,
which are the more natural grouth of those places,
could fix on them, or lessen them. Some have mixed
their Piety with their Courage, so equally, That it
was plain both were fed from the same root. They
have exposed themselves to every danger from the
Enemies, but have born indignities rather, than deride
their private differences in that Inhumane and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian
way, that the corruption of these latter
Ages has introduced, with a sort of uncontroulled
Authority among the men of the Sword. Such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Noble</hi> must needs appear with a very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Lustre, having in them all that is valuable
among the men of their sort, without any of the
abatements or diminutions that do too commonly
appear among them: Does not their Sobriety and
moderation, their temperance of Mind as well as of
Diet, the firmness of their Courage, with the modesty
of their Deportment, their Intrepidity in danger,
together with their pious Meditations, both before
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65707:16"/>
and after it, look greater and nobler, has it not an
Air in it, that arises above humane nature, and
strickes more than all the false Vanities, and the proud
boastings of pretending Hero's?</p>
            <p>I will dwell no longer on this Head, I hope it
is undeniable that instances have happened, both
among the <hi>Wise,</hi> the <hi>Mighty</hi> and <hi>Noble,</hi> of men that
have been strict and eminent Christians, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this prejudice is the less just, because not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
true: and since those few among these or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Men, have been so much superiour in their
true value, and in their usefulness to mankind, to
all the rest of their sort, there is therefore no strength
nor force in this prejudice against our Religion, that
is founded on this ground, because the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the <hi>Wise</hi> the <hi>Mighty</hi> and the <hi>Noble</hi> are not
true and sincere Christians: since that arises only
from the purity of this Religion, and the impurity
of their Tempers and Morals: so that upon the
whole matter, this becomes rather an argument to
recommend our Religion, since those who stand
out against it, do it by reason of the disorders
they fall under, in which if they could continue
secure in ours, as well as they may in other
corrupt Religions, they would probably like it as
well as any other: So that we may justly conclude
that how true soever the position in the Text may
still continue to be, yet it furnishes the world with
no just prejudice against this Religion. It remains
now in the last place that I consider.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5ly,</hi> What are the proper Inferences to be drawn from
all this, and <hi>1st.</hi> It is plain how little value we ought
to set on all those distructions that look so big in the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65707:16"/>
eyes of blinded and mistaken Men: for if on the
one hand they put men in a capacity of doing good
and great services to mankind, on the other hand
they bring them under temptations that for most
part prove too hard for humane frailty. So that
they have a double account to make, both of the
good that they might have done, but have not
done, and the evil that they have done.</p>
            <p>The men of Parts and Wit; might contribute
to enlighten the World, to make knowledge both
easier and pleasanter, they might gain an Ascendant
by the superiority of their understandings, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
the rest to their Reasons: They might by the
authority of their perswasions and the exactness of
their conduct, make the World see, in the most
sensible manner, the beauty and excellence of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Vertue: all this they might do, but if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of this, they turn the most Serious things into
Burlesque, and profane the most Sacred, if they
set themselves to face down Vertue, and to laugh
away the sense of Religion; and furnish little
dablers with some scraps to support them in their
Impieties, these persons tho pressed down with a
vast load of there own Guilt, have a huge acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from all those Crimes, that others are brought
to, by their Influence and Example: so that by a
fatal fruitfulness they are entitled to all that cursed
off-spring, That is the descent of their Wit and
humour.</p>
            <p>The Men of Authority that might set bright Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns,
and have a noble Influence over others, which
is perhaps all that is valuable in a great Post, and all
that can well ballance that vexation, and the other ill
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65707:17"/>
accidents that accompany it, will have a severe
reckoning to make, if instead of endeavouring this,
they have not only been passive and indifferent,
but have really perverted Justice, and authorized
Crimes: if they have look'd on as unconcerned at
many evils, which they might have redressed, and
not content with that, have enouraged Vice, and
promoted Wickedness: If those of whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
has said <hi>ye are Gods,</hi> a strain that without such
an authority, had passed for unsufferable flattery,
will make that, which in respect to their Character,
is not to be named, if they who might be the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
and almost the Idols of mankind, become
plagues and curses, then certainly that great exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to which God had raised them here, must end
terribly: they <hi>who have received their good things
in this</hi> Life, must look to be <hi>tormented</hi> in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the ill returns they have made for such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
favours.</p>
            <p>The Men of Birth and Blood might by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
that the world naturally paies them, and
the dependencies that are upon them, bring vertue
in credit, and put vice out of countenance: they
who make fashions in all other things, might go far
in this too, if they would set about it in good
earnest: but if they go into the Stream, they make it
so much the stronger, and to grow the more rapid.
They run good things down, by a set of bad words
which they bestow upon them, they call Religion,
Superstition, Zeal, Bigotry, Strictness of Conscience,
Narrowness of mind: The just apprehensions of the
guilt of sin, or the wrath of God goes for a poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of spirit, and a want of courage. Such words
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65707:17"/>
pass upon them, and among them without any
strict inquiry, and thus they run headlong
into false notions, so that all those great Characters
of <hi>Wise, Mighty, and Noble,</hi> that have so August a
sound, are far from answering the first Ideas, that we
naturally frame in our minds concerning them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> Men of a lower form ought to be the more
easily satisfied with that narrow Portion that has
fallen to them, since it delivers them from many
temptations, which otherwise would probably o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verset
them. A Man of a moderate sise as to
parts, tho perhaps few put themselves into this Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,
except those who are really above it, as they
have little to answer for, so they have little to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
or to fear. They may have sense enough
to know what is their duty, how they ought to go
thro this Scene of life, and what part they are to act
in it. But they were not born to disturb the Age,
to embroil Kingdoms and to distract Churches:
they are not Men of notions or speculations, yet
after all, if they are Men of Probity and Industry,
Piety, and Conscience, they may fully answer the ends
of their coming into the World, and fulfil the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
of that State of life in which they are put:
Men of Middlefortunes who are contened and easy,
who know to obey, without aspiring to command,
and who chose rather to use well what they have,
than ravenously to cover what they have not, are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from many accidents, and exempted from many
temptations. They are as much above Necessity as
below Envy: happy is a Middle-region Serene and
Calm: or if the Ballance seem rather to lean to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traem
of want, yet they are thereby carried to take San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65707:18"/>
in the secret comforts, which Religion gives:
in those two most eminently, the firm belief of a
wise Providence, and of a future State: the never-failing
Springs of Joy to those who are possessed
of them. And if those who pass for the refuse
and dreggs of Mankind, have reason to conclude
that they are the Sons of God, and the Heirs of
Glory; How easily may they bear with all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of their present condition, who have such
a Blessedness in view and in Reversion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> And lastly, let us all consider what great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
we have to bless Almighty God for this <hi>high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
calling,</hi> to which he hath called us. Let us but
compare the present State of the greatest part of the
world with our own; how much preferable are
our circumstances to theirs? for all their happier
Climates, and richer Soils: and how much does the
present condition of this Island exceed that of our
Ancestors, either in the ruder times of Paganism,
or under the later corruptions of Popery? how
sensible, how vast is the difference in all respects?</p>
            <p>Since then we are called to so holy a Religion,
and enjoy it in its true purity, with advantages
both spiritual and temporal, beyond any Church
or Nation now under Heaven, and far beyond
what we had in former ages; we have just reason
<hi>to Glory in the Lord,</hi> to value our selves upon the
favours we have received, and the priviledges
that we are under: but if we are under such pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
distinctions, the natural inference from this, is,
that we ought to distinguish our selves from all
others, and that in proportion to what we have
received: we ought to rejoyce in this light, to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65707:18"/>
walk in it, and to walk worthy of it, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
in every respect both the wiser and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for it.</p>
            <p>But if we have reason to <hi>glory in the Lord,</hi> God
knows how little reason we have, according to
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s other inference, to <hi>glory in his sight,</hi> that
is to glory or boast of our selves, This is but too
evident, and needs not be proved; the enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of particulars would be too sad and too long:
all is to be summed up in these words, that
<hi>Light is come among us, but that we love darkness bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than Light; because our Deeds are Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May the great God so touch our hearts with a
sense of all his blessings to us, and above all of his
unspeakable Love in sending his Son to die for
us, that we may bring forth fruits worthy of them,
to the glory of his great name, and to the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our souls in the day of the Lord Jesus. To
whom, with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, be all
Honour and Glory, now, and for ever.</p>
