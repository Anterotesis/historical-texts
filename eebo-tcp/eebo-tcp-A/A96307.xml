            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas <hi>Nat. Thompſon</hi> hath lately, in his <hi>publick Intelligence</hi> of the 25th of <hi>October</hi> 1681, publiſhed theſe Words following, as delivered by the <hi>Earl of Huntington</hi> to His <hi>Majeſty;</hi> the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> being at that time admitted to the Honour of Kiſſing His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Hand. That is to ſay, <hi>That the ſaid Earl had by experience found, That they who promoted the Bill of Excluſion were for the ſubverſion of Monarchy it ſelf.</hi> We who will not deny our ſelves intereſted in the promotion of that <hi>Bill</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> then judging it the beſt means of uniting His <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and the univerſality of His <hi>Subjects,</hi> and of calling back ſuch Hearts (if any ſuch were) as had in the leaſt deviated from him, or His Royal Power: Finding our ſelves for that very Reaſon involved in this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Cenſure, held it expedient to reſort to the <hi>Earl of Huntington,</hi> to know whither he own'd what <hi>Thompſon</hi> had no leſs inſolently than injuriouſly in his <hi>Lordſhips</hi> name publiſhed; which we according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did, and having demanded of the ſaid <hi>Earl</hi> the truth of that matter, He poſitively denied the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any the ſaid words, either to His <hi>Majeſty</hi> or any body elſe; with ſtrong Aſſeverations, That he knew of no perſons whatever ſo wickedly diſpoſed as the words publiſhed by <hi>Thompſon,</hi> in his <hi>Lordſhips</hi> name, imported.</p>
            <p>However, ſince ill deſigns frequently meet with ſucceſs, and the Trade of ſubverting mens Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is as really practiſed, as ſome perſons of great Ignorance, and depraved manners, would have the ſubverſion of the Government believed to be; and ſince we find our ſelves in Print, Publiſhed, and probably to have ridden poſt through the whole <hi>Kingdom,</hi> purſued with ſo reflective a Character, which will well enough ſerve turn to gratifie the Revenge of ſome, and the Malice, Pride, Ignorance and ill-humour of others: We think fit hereby to declare, That whither the <hi>Lord Huntington</hi> hath, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon ſhall hereafter affirm, That we who were for paſſing the <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Excluſion</hi> of the <hi>D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>KE of YORK</hi> (and with our ſelves, we may with Juſtice enough comprehend the univerſality of thoſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Perſons of <hi>both Houſes</hi> who concurred with us in opinion) were for the ſubverſion of the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or had any the leaſt thought or imagination tending to ſo horrid a Stratagem, ſo contrary to common ſafety, the Laws of this Kingdom, and we hope to the Will of the <hi>Wiſe Diſpoſer</hi> of all things, That ſuch Aſſertions, by whoſoever made, abound as well with Impudence and Falſehood, as with Levity and Miſconcluſion; and we would remind ſuch Traducers of the good <hi>Statutes</hi> of this <hi>Realm,</hi> which <hi>forbid any man to be ſo Hardy as to publiſh Falſehoods,</hi> (one <hi>Statute</hi> calls them <hi>Falſe-Lies)</hi> 
               <note place="margin">3. E. 3. 34. 2. R. 2. 11.</note> whereby Diſcord or occaſion of Diſcord or Slaunder may ariſe between the <hi>King</hi> and His <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> or the <hi>Great men</hi> of the <hi>Realm,</hi> the execution of which <hi>Laws</hi> we ſubmit to His <hi>Majeſties</hi> Will and Pleaſure, Relying on his Royal Word in his late <hi>Declaration:</hi> For certainly nothing can more juſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Indignation of a <hi>Prince</hi> than <hi>High Treaſon;</hi> nor diſtemper the mind of a <hi>Loyal Subject,</hi> than to have his Innocence ſo venemouſly blaſted. And we further declare, that we always were, and are ſtill readier, and more heartily diſpoſed to Draw our Swords, and expoſe our Lives for the advancement of the <hi>Kings Honour,</hi> ſupport of his <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> and ſafety of his <hi>Perſon,</hi> than ſuch Impotent <hi>Defamators</hi> (how Great ſoever) either are, or perhaps know how to be: to whom we ſubjoyn their dark countenancers, whoſe ſpecial skill lies in pilfering away the credit of well-deſerving Subjects, and privately inſinuating ſuch reproaches, as either they dare not, or are aſham'd to fix a name to.</p>
            <p>This <hi>We</hi> think fit to publiſh under our Hands, to diſabuſe the World, which ſuch dabling Politicians indeavour ſo ſhameleſly to impoſe on.</p>
