         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To his Honour'd Friend,
HENRY ASHURT, <abbr>Esq</abbr>.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have complied with
your desire in publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the following Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
upon the Death of
your Dear Brother. The
Soveraign Disposer of all
things has been pleased
to take away in a few
Years several Persons
very near to you in the
Consanguinity of Nature,
<pb facs="tcp:100548:3"/>
and younger than your
Self: a solemn Call to
remember you, that the
last Day of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Life is approaching
that will be attended with
its Night, and to excite
you to prepare for your
great Change from Time
to Eternity. You have
indeed peculiar Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Encouragement
to be Religious in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Eminence; whose
Father was so bright a
Light, and Guide to all
<pb facs="tcp:100548:3"/>
his Relations in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting
Way, by his
Holy Counsels and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Conversation. Of
him I could speak many
excellent Things, were
not his Goodness so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
known, that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
it self could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fasten an unworthy
Imputation upon him.</p>
            <p>It shall suffice to give
this short Character of
him sincerely: He was
adorn'd with all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb facs="tcp:100548:4"/>
Graces, and by
their conspicuous Exercise
was singularly eminent
among the Saints. He
made so particular an
Application of that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Precept, <hi>Thou
shalt love the Lord thy
God with all thy Heart,
and with all thy Soul,
with all thy Strength,
and with all thy Mind,</hi>
as if it had been solely
given to himself: the
Love of God inflam'd his
Heart, and shin'd in his
<pb facs="tcp:100548:4"/>
Life. This made him
one day in a week (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that which is Sacred
by Divine Appointment)
to withdraw himself from
the Business of the World,
that he might more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enjoy Communion with
the blessed Object of his
Spiritual Desires. His
Piety was in Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with all those Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
that are requisite to
accomplish a Christian:
Temperance and Purity
of Manners, Justice and
<pb facs="tcp:100548:5"/>
Equity in his Commerce
with others, and those
Vertues that cast a more
lively Lustre, and have
an attractive force upon
Men. A rare Humility, an
amiable Meekness, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
Affability and
Sweetness, compassionate
Charity and Beneficence
to the Souls and Bodies
of Men, were really ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
in his Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Actions. He
was so lovely in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
so loving to
<pb facs="tcp:100548:5"/>
all, that he was beloved
of all. The uniform and
regular Tenor of his Life
obtain'd this Testimony,
that was given to our
Blessed Master, <hi>he did all
things well.</hi> A constant
Serenity reigned in his
Countenance, the visible
sign of the Divine Calm
in his Breast, <hi>the Peace of
God that passes Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</hi>
And for an
entire Conformity to our
Saviour, that the Image
of his meek suffering
<pb facs="tcp:100548:6"/>
Evil, as well as his zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
doing Good, might
radiantly appear in this
chosen Saint, the Divine
Providence call'd him
forth to a very sharp
Tryal; for being under
the afflicting Severities
of the Stone, and by
the Advice of his dear
Friends perswaded to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to the dangerous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
of Cutting, with
what resigned Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
did he yield himself
to the Will of God?
<pb facs="tcp:100548:6"/>
With what Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
did he expect the
issue either of surviving or
dying? You remember
his words before that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Operation, <hi>When I
walk through the Valley
of the shadow of Death,
I will fear no Evil:</hi>
When so great a Wound
was made in his Flesh as
an open passage for Death
to enter, and such cruel
pains followed as struck
the Spectators with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
he endur'd them with
<pb facs="tcp:100548:7"/>
an inspired Patience and
Constancy. Thus God
was pleased to perfect
dear his Servant by Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>
            <p>Your descent from such
a Father should be a
powerful Incentive to you
to imitate his admirable
Example: you should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
whose Name you
bear: to be a faint Copy of
so bright an Original, as
it is below your Duty,
so I am perswaded will
<pb facs="tcp:100548:7"/>
not satisfy your Affections.
Methinks a sacred Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should inflame you to
excel in <hi>all Holiness and
Godliness,</hi> that the living
Image of your Father's
Graces may be clearly
visible in your Person
and Conversation. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
dear Sir, in the
everlasting way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you are so happily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced;
be always aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and with Zeal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to obtain the
Coelestial Prize. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly
<pb facs="tcp:100548:8"/>
recommend your
self, your Excellent Lady,
and your Family to the
Divine Blessing. I am
with great Respect,</p>

            <p>THESE words were
spoke by the Lord
Jesus Christ, the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Judg of the World,
upon his finishing the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to St. <hi>John.</hi> In them
we may observe, 1. An
Excitation, <hi>Behold.</hi> 2. The
Coelestial Object, <hi>I come

'Tis observable that the
prophetical Notice of the
Lord's coming to Judgment
is ushered in with great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity:
Thus <hi>Enoch</hi> the
seventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his Judiciary Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
said, <hi>Behold, the Lord
comes with ten thousand of his
Saints, to execute Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all:</hi> and the Circumstance
of the suddenness of his
Coming, is used as a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Motive to awaken our
drowsy Spirits, and fix our
scatter'd Minds intirely on
this so eminent an Object.
So the Apostle <hi>James</hi> gives an
awful Admonition, <hi>Behold,
the Judg stands before the door</hi>
ready to pass a final Sentence.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100548:10"/>
And St. <hi>John</hi> breaks forth in
an Extasy at this admirable
Spectacle, <hi>Behold, he comes
with Clouds, and every Eye shall
see him, and they which pierced
him:</hi> And the everlasting
Judg himself assures us of
his speedy Coming with this
Preface, <hi>Behold, I come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
The words contain this
Proposition.</p>
            <p>'Tis our high Wisdom and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to represent by actual and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
thoughts the certain and
speedy Coming of Christ to the
righteous Judgment of the World.</p>
            <p>I will illustrate and prove
this Doctrine in this order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100548:11"/>
               <hi>First;</hi> Consider what is
revealed in the Scripture of
his certain coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> The circumstance
of Time, his coming quickly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly;</hi> The Rewards he
will then immediately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly;</hi> The respective
difference of the Rewards,
according to the Actions of
Men in this Life. And then
apply it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First;</hi> In the managing the
first Point, I shall not insist
upon the Proofs of a future
Judgment, but only direct to
the Fountains of Arguments
that are demonstrative to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100548:11"/>
attentive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and unperverted
Minds.</p>
            <p>'Tis a Doctrine of Natural
Reason and Divine Faith: if
we consider the essential and
necessary Perfections of God,
or the Frame of Man, we
must strongly infer his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countableness
for his Actions.
There is an essential Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

and free Faculties, 'tis becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Wisdom of God to
govern him by a Law, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
his Choice and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
This is the Rule that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishes
between Vertue
and Vice, and the Holiness,
Justice, and Goodness of God
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100548:12"/>
are infallible assurances to us,
that there will be Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of Mens Actions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conforming or transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his Laws. Besides, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man has an internal Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a judicial Impression in
his Breast of this great Truth.
Conscience, the inseparable
Faculty of the reasonable
Soul, has a directing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
Light, to shew us our
Duty, to examine our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and accordingly to excuse
and comfort, or to accuse and
terrify; which Acts necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
imply, that 'tis deputed
by the Supream Judg of the
World, to observe our ways
in order to its final Testimony
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100548:12"/>
before his Tribunal. This
Proof is the more convincing
and palpable, in that those
Persons who are exempted
from humane Judgment by
their Power and Dignity,
those who are above Reproof,
and by a fatal Priviledg damn
themselves with less contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
than others, yet are
not impenetrable to the stings
of Conscience, but at times
have a conscious feeling of
their Guilt: and in those who
have so far stupified Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that 'tis either silent, or
speaks with a low Voice, yet
when they are in distress, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
in the approaches of
Death, Conscience recovers
Life and Vigor, sets their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100548:13"/>
Sins in order before them,
and flashes the Terrors of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Judgment in their faces;
an evident presage that altho
Conscience was not strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to controul their licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Appetite here, it will be
strong enough for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
and Torment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>Now Divine Revelation
renews the decayed Notions
of the future Judgment that
are natural to the Minds of
Men, and confirms them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the opposition of the
Carnal Faculties, it regulates
and enlarges them, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the Certainty and
Circumstances of it, who
shall be Judg, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100548:13"/>
of his coming, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
the Affairs of the great
Day.</p>
            <p>I will more particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon the certain coming
of Jesus Christ in Person to
judg the World; and for the
orderly discourse of it, 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
that a double coming
of Christ is foretold in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
The first in a low Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
the second in a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
State. The ends of his
first and second coming regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
their manner: The <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias</hi>
came at first, to be the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
between the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
God and sinful Man, by
patient suffering the most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive
Evils; to propitiate
the incensed Justice of Heaven
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100548:14"/>
against us; to restore us by
Humility who fell by Pride;
To illustrate his signal Love
to us, to recommend by the
efficacy of his Example, the
meek Suffering all the transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Evils of the World: But
the second will be to perform
the last Act of his Regal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
to determine the eternal
States of Angels and Men,
and suitably in the Glory of
his Deity. The Divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
were never less obscure
than in describing the first and
second coming of the <hi>Messias;</hi>
the Eclipses of the Sun of
Righteousness, and his future
Glory: and the most clear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of them in his
Humiliation, is a convincing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100548:14"/>
visible Argument they shall
be fulfilled in his Exaltation.
Now in regard his lowly O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and sorrowful Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
are the Titles to his
Triumph, and the height of
his Glory shall be answerable
to his extream Debasement;
I will briefly compare his first
and second Coming.</p>
            <p>His first Coming <hi>was in the
likeness of sinful Flesh:</hi> tho he
was exempt from the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Sin of our first Parents,
and the poisonous tincture
that is derived to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Race, being miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
conveyed by the Holy
Ghost, yet he was charged
with the Frailties, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to those Afflictions that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100548:15"/>
are the Penalties of Sin. His
first reception in the World
was so mean, that if Poverty
it self had assum'd a visible
Appearance, it could not be
received more poorly. He
was born in a Stable, and died
on the Cross, the humble Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
of his beginning was not
discordant from his ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
End: and his Life from
his first Breath to his last in
the World, was a course
through Poverty, Disgrace,
Injuries, Indignities, and the
most cruel Sufferings. He
was made not only lower
than the Angels, but than the
lowest of Men: In the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of his Type,<note place="margin">Psal. 22.</note> 
               <hi>a Worm and
no Man.</hi> In this poor, weak,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100548:15"/>
and contemptible State, dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the Clouds of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
O how unlike to him,
who appeared in a Coelestial
Vision to the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 6.</note>
sitting <hi>upon a Throne high and
lifted up,</hi> and the glorious Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphims
in a posture of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
about him, and in
an Extasy of Admiration cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>one to another,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 12. 41.</note> 
               <hi>Holy, holy,
holy is the Lord God of Hosts,
the whole Earth is full of his
Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Carnal Eyes could not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Son of God in the
Son of Man so vilified and
afflicted. The words of the
Prophet are justly applicable
to him in the state of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,<note place="margin">Isa. 45. 15.</note>
               <hi>Verily thou art a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100548:16"/>
God that hidest thy self, O God of
Israel the Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to all those steps of
our Saviours depression in his
first coming, are correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
the degrees of his Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in his second coming.
He shall come the second
time from the highest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the true Sanctuary of
God, and appear <hi>without Sin,</hi>
having perfectly expiated it
by his Sufferings on Earth.
His first coming was in <hi>Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
his <hi>second shall be in Glory.</hi>
He came at first on foot, in
<hi>the form of a Servant,</hi> then he
shall come <hi>in the form of God,</hi>
riding on the bright Clouds,
<hi>and all the Chariots of God, the
Angels of Light attending him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 68. 17.</note>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:100548:16"/>
He shall come in <hi>the Glory of
his Father,</hi> in the visible bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Deity. The Rods,
the Thorns, the Nails, the
Cross, all the conspiring In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of his cruel and
disgraceful Sufferings shall be
exchanged for the Ensigns of
Majesty: His Sacred Head
shall be crown'd with Glory,
of which the Sun in its Lustre
is but a dark shadow; <hi>a
Scepter of Righteousness shall be
in his hand,</hi> he shall sit on a <hi>great
white Throne,</hi> the Emblem of
his unspotted Holiness.</p>
            <p>His first coming was <hi>in
Weakness,</hi> but his second
shall be <hi>in Power.</hi> Thus he
told his Enemies,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 64.</note> 
               <hi>Hereafter
shall ye see the Son of Man sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100548:17"/>
on the right-hand of Power,
and coming in the Clouds of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
His Voice shall break
the silence of the Grave,
and all that are in the bowels
of the Earth, or the bottom
of the Sea, shall come forth;
<hi>they that have done good,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 28. 29.</note> 
               <hi>unto the
Resurrection of Life; they that
have done evil, to the Resurrection
of Damnation.</hi> By his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence
<hi>he will change our vile
Bodies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 21.</note> 
               <hi>that they may be fashioned
like to his Glorious Body.</hi> As
Gold at first taken out of the
Mine, seems but common
Earth, but by the refining
Fire has a Brightness superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
that it seems rather the
product of the Fire, than from
the Vein of the Earth from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100548:17"/>
whence it was taken: Thus
our Bodies that in their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
are but <hi>Earth; from the
Earthly Adam;</hi> shall by the
<hi>Power of the Lord from Heaven</hi>
be made heavenly, clothed
with a living Lustre and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor.
He will then convent
the <hi>God of this World,</hi> with all
the invisible Legions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Spirits, and force
their Submission to his High
Tribunal. He will dissolve
the old World, and raise the
new: <hi>from his Face the Earth
and the Heaven shall flee away,
and there shall be no place found
for them. According to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
we look for new Heavens,
and a new Earth, wherein dwells
Righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:100548:18"/>
Briefly, in his first coming
he was <hi>despised and rejected of
Men,</hi> condemned and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
but then he shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
from Heaven with <hi>his
mighty Angels, in flaming Fire,
to take Vengeance upon all that
know not God, and disobey the
Gospel.</hi> How will the wicked
be surpriz'd <hi>with the Terrors of
the Lord?</hi> At the promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Law, the Senses of
Hearing and Seeing, that are
the inlets of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Terror, were so
strongly affected with the
Presence of God, when fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Lightnings were darted
from his Eyes, and Clouds of
Smoke came from the Breath
of his Nostrils, and at the
<hi>loud sounding of the Trumpet,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:100548:18"/>
and <hi>the quaking of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi>
that the Hearts of the
Spectators were ready to die
within them, and <hi>Moses</hi> himself
was <hi>terribly afraid;</hi> but how
will the Sights and Sounds
at the last day overwhelm
the guilty with Terrors, when
the Son of God shall appear <hi>in
his terrible Majesty!</hi> when the
<hi>Arch-angel shall blow the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
of God,</hi> when the Pillars
of Heaven shall fall, and the
Foundations of the Earth be
overthrown, and a dreadful
Judgment shall pass upon
the impenitent Transgressors
of the eternal Law! how
will they appear spiritless, in
sad Confusion in <hi>the great Day
of the Lord Almighty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:100548:19"/>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> We are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Circumstance of
Time, <hi>his coming quickly.</hi> 'Tis
verified by universal Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that no carnal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
does more fortify Sinners
in a false Security, <hi>than putting
the evil day far from them,</hi> and
the Presumption that they are
not in present danger of God's
Displeasure, when inevitable
and great Evils are look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as remote, they make a
slite Impression, but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquity
of such Evils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires
Terrors. We have an
Instance of this in <hi>Cain,</hi> who
(after God had denounced
his Punishment for his bloody
crying Sin) full of Perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100548:19"/>
and Dispair breaks forth,
<hi>My Punishment is greater than I
can bear! and it shall come to
pass, that every one that findeth
me, shall slay me.</hi> But when
he was secured from present
Revenge, and expected a long
Life in this World, he freely
indulged his sensual Desires,
and <hi>built a City,</hi> to drown the
noise of his accusing Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
The World follows this
way of <hi>Cain,</hi> and freely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues
the Satisfaction of their
Lusts. When Men look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Divine Judgment at
an immense distance, and
<hi>when the evil Servant shall say
in his Heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 24.</note> 
               <hi>my Lord delays his
coming,</hi> he will satisfy both the
angry and voluptuous Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100548:20"/>
he <hi>will smite his fellow-Servants,
and eat and drink with
the drunken.</hi> To awaken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Mens drowsy Spirits to
prepare for the Judgment of
the great Day, to check their
exorbitant Lusts, <hi>their Lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viousness,
excess of Wine,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veling</hi>
'tis threatened, <hi>they shall
give an account of them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 14. 1, 3.</note> 
               <hi>to him who
is ready to judg the Quick and the
Dead.</hi> And to induce a patient
Temper and asswage Sorrow,
the Apostle <hi>James</hi> encourages
afflicted Christians, <hi>that the
Judg stands before the door.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a seeming diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
how to reconcile the
Predictions of Christ's sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
coming to Judgment,
with the interval of so many
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100548:20"/>
intire Ages laps'd since, and
what may remain of Time
before the last Day is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
This difficulty will be
resolved by considering the
following Particulars.</p>
            <p>1. The words of the Text
are to be understood in the
strict literal Sense: For our
Saviour having represented in
a visionary Scene the State
of the Church in the several
Periods of its Duration to
the end of the World, its
Conflicts, Victory, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
over Antichristian E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
and having described
the Tranquillity, Purity and
Glory of the Church in the
very last part of Time, which
is preparative to the glorious
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100548:21"/>
everlasting State in the next
World, he declares, <hi>I come
quickly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 22. 5.</note> 
               <hi>and my Reward is with
me:</hi> After the final accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of those Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
there is no more use of
Time, <hi>the unjust, and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and filthy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esa. 22. 1.</note> continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd
and impenitent;<note place="margin">Micah. 7. 1.</note> 
               <hi>the
righteous and holy</hi> are confirm'd
in their Perseverance,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note> and
immediately shall receive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences
according to their
Works.</p>
            <p>2. The whole flux of Time,
from the first to the second
coming of Christ is called the
<hi>last days.</hi> The Prophets foretold
of an astonishing Change that
should arrive in the Church
and the World, that the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100548:21"/>
Law should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish'd,
when the <hi>Messias,</hi>
the Substance of it, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
was come, and a new
Covenant be immutably e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish'd
in the Church, 'tis
the final expiring of Time.
In this Sense the Apostle
speaks to Christians in the first
Age of the Church;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Now all
these things happened unto them
for Examples, and they are writen
for our Admonition, upon whom
the Ends of the World are come.</hi>
Now in the division of Time,
this being the last part of it,
for the duration of the World,
the second coming of Christ is
represented as near. The last
Glass of Time was turn'd
up at the Revelation of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100548:22"/>
Gospel by the Son of God,
and now the last Sands are
running; when 'tis out, it
shall never be turned more.</p>
            <p>3. Sometimes the speedy
coming of Christ to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
immediately respects
the destruction of the Jewish
State, and their principal Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Thus in his last Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n
on Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> the
T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mple being in his view, he
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>retold <hi>that one Stone shall not
be left upon another:</hi> And after
his describing the fearful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
that should surprize that
Nation, tells his Disciples, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
I say unto you, this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
shall not pass,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 24.</note> 
               <hi>till all these
things be fulfilled.</hi> The time
of this Judgment, is <hi>called the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100548:22"/>
great and illustrious Day of the
Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 2. 20.</note> when by visible Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
upon that Nation, he
declar'd his Divine Power and
Glory before the World. And
to this famous Destruction of
the Jews, may refer several
places, where the Apostle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages
Believers to unfaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perseverance in their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
notwithstanding the cruel
Opposition they met with
from Infidels of the Jewish
Nation: <hi>Not forsaking the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
of our selves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> 
               <hi>as the
manner of some is, but exhort one
another, and so much the more as
ye see the day approaching;</hi> that
is, when Christ will appear for
the subduing his Enemies, and
for the relieving his People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:100548:23"/>
4. We must distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Judgment of Sense
and of Faith, and this will
rectify our estimate of the
time of God's particular
Judgment upon Earth, and
of his universal Judgment
when he will distribute eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Recompences. To Sense
<hi>Afflictions seem not only grievous,</hi>
but often they seem long: for
Sorrow fastens the Thoughts
upon the Affliction; in sharp
Pains the Soul is as it were
confined to the diseased part,
and strictly observes all the
hours and smaller parts of
their Duration, which when
we are at ease slip away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
notice. In distress we
would fain hasten away the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100548:23"/>
present time, expecting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
by what shall succeed:
and winged time seems slow
in its motion. From hence
are so many doleful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of the Saints, <hi>Lord,
how long?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 70. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>Lord, make haste:</hi> as
if he had forgot to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to relieve them, and just
to repay their cruel Enemies.
But Faith in the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
looks to their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
in the time set by
the most wise and holy dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
of all things. A stedfast Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
never counts God slow
in coming to Judgment; for
he is never too late. <hi>The Vision
of the Churches Deliverance is
for an appointed time, but at the
end it shall speak and not lie; tho
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100548:24"/>
it tarry, wait for it, because it
will surely come, it will not tarry.</hi>
This is applied by the Apostle
to the particular Judgment
upon <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to the universal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
<hi>For yet a little while, and
he that shall come will come,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and
will not tarry: tho he bears long
with the Sufferings of his own
Elect, yet he will avenge them
speedily:</hi> At the prefixed time,
when the number of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
shall be compleat, and
all the <hi>Vessels of Wrath are fitted
for Destruction,</hi> the discerning
Judg will come and separate
them for ever.</p>
            <p>5. Compare Time with
Eternity. Time is numbred
and distinguished by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100548:24"/>
of the Sun and Moon,
and is accounted long or
short by us with respect to
our transient and limited Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the present World:
but Eternity is an endless Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
The whole space of
Time, from the first Motions
of the Heavens to the last,
has not that proportion to
Eternity, as a short Span has
to the vast Compass of the
Heaven. Now God, who
is absolutely eternal, and
truly infinite, measures the
continuance of things by his
own Standard: according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Psalmist tells us,<note place="margin">Psal. 90. 4.</note> 
               <hi>A
thousand Years in his sight, are
but as yesterday when it is past,
and as a Watch in the Night:</hi> as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100548:25"/>
the space of a few hours that
passes without the least per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
in sleep. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
his suffering Church: <hi>for
a small moment have I forsaken
thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esa. 54. 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>but with great Mercy will
I gather thee: In a little Wrath
I hid my face from thee, but with
everlasting Kindness will I have
Mercy on thee.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
to the Infidels of the
last days, who scornfully say,
<hi>Where is the Promise of his
coming?</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.</note> 
               <hi>One day with the Lord
is as a thousand Years, and a
thousand Years as one day:</hi> all
the measures of Time are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
in Eternity. This
estimate will reconcile the
two seeming opposite Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the long delaying, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100548:25"/>
the speedy coming of the
Judg.</p>
            <p>If a Malefactor be taken,

in God's Duration is no more
than the shortest among Men.
And the Application of this
is more sensible and evident,
with respect to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Judgment that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
attends the Death of
Men, whether graciously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding,
or justly punishing
them: <hi>The Afflictions of the
Saints are but for a moment,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.</note>
compared with the eternal
State of Glory they enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
and tho an impenitent
Sinner live to extream Age,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100548:26"/>
yet <hi>his Judgment did not slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
but was hastning, for his
Death, that is the end of an
hundred Years on Earth, will
be to him the beginning of an
hundred thousand Years in
Hell, attended with an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Duration after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly;</hi> We are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Rewards he will then
immediately distribute. What
the Rewards shall be in their
general nature we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
but the degrees of
Happiness or Misery in the
future State are beyond the
utmost comprehension of our
Thoughts, or expressions of
our Words. A Child may as
soon be instructed to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100548:26"/>
and relate the deepest
Counsels of a Senate; as a
mortal Man can fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
or explicate what Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or Hell is. The Judg
stiles it <hi>my Reward, who is the
great. God and our Saviour:</hi>
and 'tis correspondent to his
infinite Goodness and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or to his terrible Majesty
and offended Justice. Who
can unfold the Treasures of
his Love, or the Treasures of
his Wrath? <hi>Who knows the
Power of his Anger?</hi> Tho no
Resemblance be capable to
express fully the soveraign
Felicity, and the extream Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
in the future State, yet
for our Instruction they are
set forth in the most intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100548:27"/>
and affecting manner
with respect to our narrow
Capacities. The Reward of
the Saints is a State of Glory
and Joy in the Presence of
the blessed God, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of true Felicity. The
Apostle assures us, that those
who continue in well-doing
shall be <hi>rewarded with Glory,
and Honour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> 
               <hi>and Immortality.</hi>
The Reward is shadowed
forth by chosen Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
a <hi>Crown of Glory, a
Crown of Life:</hi> by the Joys
of a <hi>Marriage Festival</hi> that
shall be celebrated in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of God. In short, the
Reward contains the highest
Perfection and exceeding Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of the reasonable
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100548:27"/>
Nature. Our most beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Expressions darken the
Eternal Brightness of that
State: Heaven is infinitely
better known by one minutes
Enjoyment, than by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of the Divinest O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator.</p>
            <p>The Recompence from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging
Justice is set forth
by words of the heaviest Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification:
by <hi>Indignation and
Wrath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Tribulation and Anguish:</hi>
and by most fearful Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations,
to typify the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Damned: <hi>by
the Worm that never dies, and the
Fire that shall never be quenched:</hi>
by the blackness of Darkness
for ever, and the bottomless
Gulph of Horror and Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100548:28"/>
Briefly, as the blessed
Reward eminently contains
all those Joys, of which we
have but dark shadows here,
so the Punishment is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
and fearful than the
literal meaning of the most
violent Figures express. This
Reward he saith <hi>is with him.</hi>
This I shall consider in three
things.</p>
            <p>1. 'Tis a present Reward.
Here the Saints have a sure
Title to <hi>the immortal and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
Inheritance; a right to the
Tree of Life. He that hath the
Son, hath everlasting Life:</hi> an
unfeigned Faith that <hi>unites us
to Christ, that purifies the Heart
and Conversation, and works by
Love to our Redeemer,</hi> secures to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100548:28"/>
us an intire Interest in the
Kingdom of Glory, both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
of it by the sacred
Treasure of Christ's Blood,
and the unchangeable Tenor
of the Gospel, wherein God
promises Heaven to all obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
Believers: but the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
bestowing of this upon
their entire Persons, is not
till the last day. Then the
King <hi>will say to them on his
Right-hand, come ye blessed of
my Father, inherit the Kingdom
prepared for you from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the World.</hi> He will
crown them with his own
Hands, and imediately intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them <hi>into his own Joys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:100548:29"/>
Now Sentence is past up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those who disobey the
Gospel; <hi>he that believes not, is
condemned already,</hi> but the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of it is suspended for a
while. Tho sinful Men are
guilty of such violent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
as would conquer
all created Patience, yet their
Judg endures with much long-suffering
<hi>the Vessels of Wrath
fitted for Destruction. He is
the God of Patience,</hi> 'tis one
of the Divine Attributes, and
cannot be violated by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities
of rebellious Sinners,
but has its <hi>perfect Work</hi> in this
lower World. He ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
the Serenity and Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that is inseparable from
the Perfections of his own
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100548:29"/>
Nature, and spares the wicked
for a time in order to their
Salvation: but when he
comes to Judgment, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
will immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:
For the Sentence will
be peremptory and final;
there can be no Appeal from
it: The Son shall then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
with equal Majesty and
Authority with the Father:
<hi>All Judgment is committed to
him:</hi> And his Power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the definitive Sentence
is irresistible, we may read
the Tenor of it, <hi>Take him,
bind him hand and foot, and cast
him into outer Darkness:</hi> there
is no possible escape by flight
from his righteous Fury, no
possible resistance of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100548:30"/>
Power, but the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
shall presently suffer the
decreed Vengeance.</p>
            <p>2. The Reward is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat:
for it shall be the issue
of final Judgment, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to <hi>all things done in the
Body, whether good or evil.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
Souls act in their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
States: the Saints above
continually glorify God, and
do his Commands: The
wicked in Hell continually
blaspheme God: but the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of the Saints in Heaven
is not in order to a Reward,
for they are actually possest
of it, and compleat Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is a principal part of their
Felicity: and the Sins of the
Damned do not incur a new
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100548:30"/>
Guilt, and expose them to
more Severities of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for they are in the
hands of revenging Justice,
and their Sin is a principal
part of their Punishment.
The Rewardableness of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Actions is limited to the
present Life; and when Men
shall appear before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Seat of Christ, a full
Reward will be distributed
to them.</p>
            <p>Here the faithful Servants
of God have some Vails to
encourage them in their
Work, and to delight in their
Duty: and in their various
Sorrows and Sufferings they
are cheared with some fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running
Beams of Heavenly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100548:31"/>
Light, revived with the Air
of Paradise, refresh'd with
Waters of Life from the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Springs of Comfort, the
Promises of God, <hi>and rejoyce
in the hope of Glory:</hi> but then
they are received into God's
glorious Presence, <hi>where there
is fulness of Joy, and Rivers of
Pleasure for ever.</hi> What De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
can there be in their
Happiness when they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into <hi>the Joy of their Lord,
and Joy enters into them</hi> reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
all their Faculties?</p>
            <p>Here the wicked feel some
beginnings of Sorrows, the
twinges of an accusing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
that settles into the
undying Worm: The first
Breath of God's Indignation
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100548:31"/>
sometimes singes them here:
but then the Flames of it will
break forth with vehemence:
in this World his Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is a Compound of Justice
and Mercy, he is unwilling
to use Extremity: when he
is exceedingly provok'd, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
mollifies the Rigor of
Justice, calms the Fierceness
of his Wrath, lightens the
Weight of his Power: he
<hi>does not reward them according
to their Iniquities:</hi> but then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will break the blow of
his Revenging Hands: Strict
Justice will then inflict a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
commensurate to
the guilt of their Sins. All
the leading Faculties of the
Soul, the Mind, the Fancy,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100548:32"/>
the Memory, the Will, the
Affections, that have been
polluted with Sin, all the
sensitive Faculties of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
that have been instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
in the commission of Sin,
shall be tormented. The
voluptuous Wretch, whose
Soul was drown'd in Flesh
and Blood, and riotously
feasted every day, his Tongue
was tormented in the Fire.</p>
            <p>Briefly, Pain is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
and violent according
to the Capacity of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and the Activity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of the Agent: Thus
in the Body those parts that
are of the quickest and most
tender Sense, are most recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Pain; and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sharp
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100548:32"/>
and piercing Humours
fall upon them, are vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
affected: How great
shall be the Punishment,
when the intire Man the Soul
and Body are prepared to be
most capable of Torment,
and Infinite Power inflict
it? <hi>weeping and gnashing of
Teeth,</hi> extream Sorrow, and
extream Rage, are the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of Damnation. O
doleful State beyond all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Expression!</p>
            <p>3. The Reward is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual:
'tis the issue of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Judgment:</hi> The Sentence
is fixt and unalterable for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
The <hi>Saints shall ever be
with the Lord,</hi> whose Presence
is the living Fountain of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100548:33"/>
Their Bodies shall be
endowed with a Coelestial
unfading Beauty and Vigor
becoming the glorious Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Sons of God:
their Souls shall for ever be
satisfied with the sight of his
Glory, and ravish'd with the
Fruition of his Love. There
is no defect in that blessed
State, and no danger of losing
it. The Love of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his elect Vessels of
Mercy is as unchangeable as
his Nature: and the Divine
Beauty fixes the flame of their
pure Affections upon the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
They enjoy an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Communion with him.
Eternity crowns and consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
their Happiness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:100548:33"/>
The wicked are excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
from the Beatifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Presence of God, and the
joyful Society of the Saints
for ever. They are imprison'd
in Hell during the Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of the Immortal King,
who is inflexibly angry, and
irreconcileable for ever In
the present State violent Pains
or Passions extinguish Life,
as a fierce Fire devours the
matter that feeds it: The
natural Body could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the Torments of Hell a
moment, the frail Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Flesh would presently
be dissolved: But the Divine
Power will uphold the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in vivacity to feel infernal
Torments. Here there are
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100548:34"/>
intermissions and pauses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the strokes of God's
Hand; even <hi>Pharoah</hi> that
proud Rebel was indulg'd at
times, to lead him to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
but there is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessant
perpetuity of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
the obstinate Sons of
Darkness are without ease or
end of their Misery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the respective difference
of the Rewards, according to
the Actions of Men in this
Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that with respect
to the kinds whether good or
evil, and the degrees of good
and evil in them. He will

               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:100548:34"/>

He will try our good Works
inclusively, with our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

wherein their spiritual
value consists. He alone has
exact Scales to <hi>weigh the Spirits
of Men,</hi> a Divine Faculty to
see the deepest Seeds of their
Actions. When Religious
Duties, when Acts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and of any Vertue are
performed in Obedience to
God, to please and glorify
him, they shall be rewarded
accordingly: but when done
from Carnal Motives, for
our own Repu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation, our

not found your Works full before
me:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 2.</note> tho never so specious
and glittering in the Eyes and
esteem of Men, tho appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with a great show of
Goodness, yet without the
internal Exercise of gracious
Affections that are the Life
of Obedience, they are of
no account in that day. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Sincerity,
Zeal, and measure of our
good Works, the Reward
shall be: <hi>He that sows sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
shall reap sparingly;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 9. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and he
that sows bountifully, shall reap
bountifully.</hi> This Rule of
Judgment does not in the
least imply that there is any
desert of the Reward in the
best Works of Men: the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100548:35"/>
Scripture is most express, <hi>that
Eternal Life is the Gift of God
through Jesus Christ our Lord:</hi>
The Kingdom of Glory is
infinitely more a Gift than a
Reward.</p>
            <p>As the Predestination of
the Saints to Life is an Act
of Soveraign Mercy; so the
Glorification of them is an
Act of equally free Mercy,
without respect to any Merit
of ours: but the wise and
holy Lawgiver dispenses the
blessed Reward according to
the Tenour of our good
Works: and as by the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Reward he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
what value he sets up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Obedience; so by the
exactness of our Obedience
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100548:36"/>
we declare what value we
set upon the Reward.</p>
            <p>The Recompences of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributive

Sins of Thoughts and Words,

them.</hi> The more rebellious,

Sinners now are, the more

portion. <hi>Those who know their
Masters will, and do it not,
shall be beaten with many Stripes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Proceedings of that
day shall be transacted by the
Son of God in his glorified
Humane Nature, and suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to the Capacities of Men
that the Justice of his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
may be evident: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
St <hi>John,</hi> describing the

               <hi>I saw the Dead, small

and the Books were opened; and
the Dead were judged out of
those things that were written in
the Books, according to their
Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Records of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
shall then be opened,
and all the Sins of Men, even
those that are now obliterated
and forgotten, shall then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in so clear an Impression,
with all their Aggravations,
that the wicked will be inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable
to themselves, and
Conscience will subscribe
their Condemnation. The
Judg himself who knows
all things will then unfold
the Registers of his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and publish their Sins
before the World. <hi>Then shall

the King say, I was hungry, and

and by just Analogy we may
infer he will charge Sins of
all kinds upon the Wicked,
of which they have been
guilty, that the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Reasonableness of
his Proceedings may appear:
he will overcome when he
judges, the Condemned shall

in Judgment, our Misery is
irrecoverable. There may
be Errors in Humane Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and other days of
Trial to review and alter the
Sentence; but the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the last day is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable.
And is it a slight
matter to be saved or damn'd
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100548:39"/>
for ever? <hi>Then the Children of
this World are absolutely wiser
than the Children of Light.</hi> But
'tis not possible for the Mind
of Man, unless monstrously
perverted, to conceive such
a Thought. From whence
then is it, that the eternal
Judgment is so unconsider'd,
so unexpected, and unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for, by most of the
World? <hi>Should not the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of their Judg make Sinners
afraid?</hi> His universal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
<hi>for all things are naked
and open to him, with whom we
have to do;</hi> His immaculate
Holiness, <hi>for he is of purer
Eyes than to behold Iniquity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
aversation;</hi> His incorruptible
Justice <hi>that will not spare
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100548:39"/>
the guilty;</hi> His <hi>Eternal Power</hi>
that can so easily and terribly
revenge all wilful Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his Law, and has
been so insolently contemned,
all the Perfections of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature, and the bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sufferings of his Hmane
Nature to purchase Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
so wretchedly neglected,
will render their Judgment
fearful and intolerable.<note place="margin">Esa. 10. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>What
will they do in the day of Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?
Can their Hearts endure,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 22.</note>
                  <hi>or their Hands be strong in the
day that he will deal with them?</hi>
Can they think to mitigate
his hot Displeasure, when his
Clemency, so often despised,
will inflame his Justice? All
the Mercies which they have
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100548:40"/>
so ungraciously abus'd, shall
be produc'd in Testimony of
their Rebellion, heighten'd
with the most unworthy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude:
What Consternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will seize the Guilty, when
ten thousand Accusers shall
rise up in Judgment against
them, and not one Advocate
appear for their Defence?
Methinks the hearing such
terrible Truths should make
their Ears tingle, and their
Hearts die within them, yet
(O astonishing Security!)
tho God speaks so loud by
the Voice of his Ministers,
and sometimes by his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Providence, they are as
deaf as Adders; but let a
carnal Lust whisper within
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100548:40"/>
from their earthly part, they
presently hear and are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
From whence is it
that the Eternal Judgment,
so sure as Death, does not
cause an extream Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in unpardoned Sinners?
The next cause of this Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
is, that they <hi>put the evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
at a remote distance, as
the Scorners said, <hi>the Vision is</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 12. 22.</note>
                  <hi>for many days:</hi> they study to
be secure, and delay their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations,
presuming to have
time enough before them.
Vain Men! how willingly
do they deceive themselves?
Can they be assured of
the present Life one hour?
Some in their impure Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces,
others at voluptuous
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100548:41"/>
Feasts have been seized by
Divine Justice: the day of
Death is equivalent to the
day of Judgment; for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after there is a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
decision and actual dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of Men for ever.</p>
               <p>That we may therefore be
duly prepared, these Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are to be followed.</p>
               <p>1. Let it be our special
care to plant the Belief of this
great Truth in our Minds,
and preserve it in its Vigor,
that we may feel its Efficacy
and Influence in our Hearts
and Lives. Customary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
whose assent to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Truths is only from the
prejudice of Education, and
the current Opinions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100548:41"/>
with whom they live,
are as careless and secure as
direct Atheist: The substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Fruits of Godliness and
Holiness spring from internal
Notions deeply establish'd,
and experimentally felt in the
Soul. The usual coldness in
the Duties of Religion, and
presumptuous boldness in Sin,
is because Men have but a slite
Belief of their great account.
But we have infallible assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from the Judg him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
<hi>Behold, I come quickly:
his Throne is like the fiery Flame,
and his Wheels as burning Fire,</hi>
an Emblem of his swift
coming to Judgment. The
stedfast Belief of this will
arrest our vain Thoughts, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100548:42"/>
controul our vicious Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and regulate our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations.
Faith is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Fear; and Fear is a
preventive Passion, it enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
the Mind to consider with
becoming seriousness, how <hi>to
escape the Damnation of Hell.</hi>
Then we throughly believe
this fundamental Principle of
Religion, when the design
and work of our Lives is to
be approved by our Judg.</p>
               <p>2. Moderation both in the
Pleasures and Business of the
World is requisite, that we
may with intire Application
of Mind prepare to appear
before our Judg. 'Tis the
aweful Caution of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
to his Disciples, <hi>Take
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100548:42"/>
heed to your selves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 21. 34, 35.</note> 
                  <hi>lest at any
time, your Hearts be overcharged
with Surfeiting and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Cares of this Life,
and so that Day come upon you
unawares. For as a Snare shall
it come on all them, that dwell on
the face of the whole Earth.
Watch ye therefore and pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
that ye may be accounted
worthy to escape all these things
that shall come to pass, and to
stand before the Son of Man.</hi>
The universal Snares that
fasten Men in security are sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
Pleasures and Worldly
Cares: They are natural and
insinuating into our Hearts.
A dissolute voluptuous course
is attended with a stupid neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of God and the Soul:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100548:43"/>
and the indulging of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Appetites, tho not in such
vicious Excesses, as the noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
profane are guilty of,
lessens the fear of Caution,
which is instrumental to make
us serious and diligent, lest
we be surprized in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared
State by the Judg of
the World. The subtilty
of Satan is to be observed, he
does not tempt Men to take
so deep a surfeit of Pleasures
as might cause a loathing of
them, but gently feeds the
voluptuous diseased Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
knowing that a Sensual
Life alienates the Mind from
a severe reflecting upon the
State of their Souls, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
a deep forgetfulness
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100548:43"/>
of their Accounts with God.
From hence it is, that the
danger wherein so many are
of losing their Souls for ever,
is not perceived till their case
be desperate.</p>
               <p>Others are so involv'd in
Secular Business, their Minds
are so overshaded with the
Cares of the World, that
they are not at leisure to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<hi>to the one thing necessary,</hi>
and can take no right Aspect
of the World to come. Their
Affections are stiff and setled
in the Earth, their Thoughts
are immerst in the Affairs of
this present Life; they think
it their Discretion and Duty
to ingage in the uncessant
prosecution of their Worldly
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100548:44"/>
Designs, and the Devil takes
this advantage to prevent in
them the pity and care of
their Immortal Souls: Or if
at any time serious Desires
are kindled in them to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
an inundation of
Worldly Thoughts present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
quench them. Thus Men
perish by the abuse of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things. The Flood broke
in upon the old World whilst
they <hi>were eating and drinking,
marrying and giving in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi>
buying and selling, <hi>and
destroyed them all:</hi> The last
Fire will devour the present
World in the same dull In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitancy,
and stupid neglect
to prepare themselves for
Judgment, <hi>As it was in the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100548:44"/>
days of</hi> Noah,<note place="margin">Luke 17. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>so it shall be in
the days of the Son of Man.</hi>
The sensual and worldly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded
are usually secure,
and when they <hi>shall say Peace
and Safety, sudden Destruction
cometh upon them, as Travel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Woman with Child,</hi> as sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizingly
as irresistably, <hi>and
they shall not escape.</hi> 'Tis a divine
and solemn warning,<note place="margin">Rev. 16. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold,
I come as a Thief in the night,
blessed is he that watcheth, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his Garments unspotted from
the World, lest he be found naked
without the Robe</hi> of Holiness,
and be exposed to confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Shame in the great Day.</p>
               <p>3. The frequent and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
trial of Conscience with
respect to our spiritual State,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100548:45"/>
and the Actions of our Lives
is requisite to our preparing
our selves for our last ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:
for there will be a
a manifestation of them in
that day. The most never
spend a serious hour in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
whether they <hi>are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
from Death to Life.</hi> The
Rule of Judgment is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by St. <hi>John; He that
hath the Son, hath Life: and he
that hath not the Son, hath not
Life.</hi> The Justification of our
Persons from the guilt of our
Sins, is wholly to be ascribed
to the Divine Mercy upon
the account of his most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Merits and Mediation:
and all the saving Benefits
purchas'd by his Death are
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100548:45"/>
actually applied only to those
who are united to him by an
unfeigned lively Faith. All
the vital Influences of his
Merits are derived from him
to his Members: <hi>he is the
Head of the Church and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of the Body.</hi> His most
precious Blood that was shed
on the Cross, must be <hi>sprinkled
on the Conscience to purge it
from dead Works: The Blood of
sprinkling speaks better things
than the Blood of</hi> Abel. And
the Faith that is saving is not
a mere assent in Speculation
to the Doctrine of the Gospel,
but such a Belief in the Blessed
Mediator of his reconciling
us to God, as produces a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative
Love to him, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100548:46"/>
by that Love sincere and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
Obedience to his most
holy Laws. By Faith we
are justified from the Guilt
of Sin, by Works from the
Charge of Hypocrisy, in that
we have sincerely complied
with the Terms of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
by receiving intire Christ
as our Lord and Saviour.</p>
               <p>We can never with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
appear before the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Lord, if we have not an
interest in him as the <hi>Lord our
Righteousness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are some of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Temper and Civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
that finally miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
by their neglect of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Christ with earnest
hunger and thirst after his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100548:46"/>
Righteousness, which alone
can endure the Trial of God's
Judgment-Seat for our Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution:
They have not such
a conscious feeling of their
undone Condition by Sin, as
to make them earnestly seek
for a Remedy: the Deceiver
of Souls insinuates into their
secret Thoughts, that they are
safe enough, and shall stand in
Judgment, because they are
not guilty of enormous
Crimes; they rarely feel the
lashes of Conscience, which
those who rebel against the
clear Light do. But how
fair so ever the Lives of Men
appear, such is the exact Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Divine Law, so
many known and secret Sins
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100548:47"/>
even the most circumspect
are guilty of, that without an
interest in the Blessed Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
they will be cast in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for ever. 'Tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of infinite Consequence
to examine our selves whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we are in a state of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and Acceptance with
God: the Jealousy of many
holy and tender Spirits sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
the comfortable Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Conscience, and
the vicious Self-love of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Persons supends the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
Judgment of it.</p>
               <p>Besides, the daily review
of our Actions is of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
use to prepare us for our
last account. Conscience is
plac'd in our Bosoms as a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100548:47"/>
Inspector and Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
Judg, to observe our
Actions and compare them
with the Rule, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to censure or approve us:
When we fail in our Duty,
and violate God's Precepts,
it should work upon the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of Grief and Shame,
and cause us earnestly to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
to the Throne of Grace
for Pardon: and renew the
Application of the Blood of
Christ to our Souls. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the quality of our
Sins, our Repentance should
be more solemn and special,
we should more severely judg
our selves that we may <hi>not be
judged by the Lord.</hi> This is
very unpleasant Work to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100548:48"/>
Men: but 'tis the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensible
Condition of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
pardoning Mercy:
'tis the most congruous way
of recovering Sinners both
for the Honour of God, and
our Good, for the broken
and contrite Person will most
prize the Favour of God, and
be most fearful of returning
to Sin. Indeed then our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is unto Life,</hi> when the
dominion of Sin is subdued,
and the way is forsaken.
Now, the speedy coming of
our Judg should recommend
this severe Repentance to us:
it should excite Conscience
to the daily observation of
our Errors, then when Sins
are committed, we may be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100548:48"/>
restless till we get them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned:
tho Men may suppress
and smother the Convictions
of Conscience at the present,
yet it will shortly, like a fierce
and terrible Officer, take
the Guilty by the Throat and
command him to pay what
he owes to Divine Justice.
'Tis our Wisdom to compare
the bitterness of Repentance
with the Torments of Hell:
Repenting Sorrow is for the
cure of Sin, the Sorrow of
Hell is for the Punishment
of Sinners for ever. <hi>Repent,
that your Sins may be blotted
out in the times of Refreshment
from the Presence of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The perswasion of this
Doctrine is an excellent
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100548:49"/>
means to obtain a calm and
contented frame of Spirit in
every State: For if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
within a little while all
Civil Distinctions of High
and Low, Rich and Poor, shall
be at an end, and only the
Moral Distinctions of Holy
and Unholy, Righteous and
Unrighteous, shall remain,
that all must stand in an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Line before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Seat
of Christ, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
eternal Recompences,
how will it vilify this World
in our esteem, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
make a mean and
low Condition tollerable to
us? 'Tis related of <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi>
that being in a Storm
at Sea, he was fain to strip
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100548:49"/>
himself naked and swim for
his Life, carrying in one
hand his Commentaries writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by himself of his Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
Actions: Within a short
time we must be devested of
all the external Circumstances
of the present Life, Riches,
Honours, Dignities, and of
the Garment of our Flesh,
and our naked Souls shall
only carry with them the
Book of Conscience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all our Actions are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with our own Hands,
into that vast Eternity before
us: this should make us more
indifferent what our present
State is, that we must short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leave, and very sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
to order our Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100548:50"/>
so as to be accepted of
our Judg.</p>
               <p>Particularly it should ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Praise or Dispraise of
Men a very small matter to
us. Within a little while we
shall only have to do with
God, depend intirely upon
him, and according as his
Sentence shall be favourable
or fatal, must be determin'd
for ever; how reasonable
then is it in comparison of
his Judgment to disvalue the
contingent Opinions of Men,
who raise or depress our
Names according to their
Fancies and Passions, and to
be satisfied in God's Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:100548:50"/>
5. The Consideration of
this Point should encourage
us joyfully to endure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
or Violence for the
Testimony of Divine Truth,
to suffer for Righteousness
sake: for, as the Apostle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
the suffering Christians,
<hi>Within a little while, he that shall
come will come, and will not tarry;</hi>
and will bestow an excellent
Reward in Heaven upon his
faithful Servants. This, duly
considered, will inspire not
only Patience, but Divine
Joy in the Saints in their
most afflicted State for the
Name of Christ.</p>
               <p>6. The Consideration of this
great Truth should regulate
our Deportment towards all
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100548:51"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:100548:52"/>
Men, with Sincerity, Equity,
Benignity, and Clemency.
'Tis the Apostles chosen Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<hi>Let no Man go beyond,
or defraud his Brother in any
matter;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>because the Lord is the
Avenger of all such. Let your
Moderation be known to all Men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 5.</note>
                  <hi>the Lord is at hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To sum up all: Let us
with intire Application of
Soul, and zealous Endeavours
strive to be approv'd by our
Judg. <hi>We labour,</hi> saith the
Apostle,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>whether present or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
to be accepted by him.</hi> The
certain Rules of pleasing him,
are to imitate his Example,
and obey his Precepts. He
will be a Lamb to all who
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100548:52"/>
are like him in Innocence,
Patience, and Purity. He
<hi>went about doing Good: let us
do good to all, especially to the
Houshold of Faith.</hi> To use an
Estate only for mean Ends,
our Temporal Convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
much more to abuse and
pervert it, to foment Pride and
Luxury, will make our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
to be uncomfortable,
and grievous: but to be <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and rich in Good Works,</hi> is
the infallible way to obtain a
rich Reward. He forgave his
cruel and unrighteous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
his dying Prayer mixt
with his precious Blood was
to reconcile God to those who
shed it; and our Absolution
in his Judgment is suspended
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:100548:53"/>
upon this indispensable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that from the Heart
we forgive even the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
Offences,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> and violent
Provocations from others. An
unforgiving Temper, like a
Mill-stone fasten'd about the
Neck, will sink us into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathom'd
Misery. He that
is stiff and irreconcileable, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
never seriously considers
his own numerous Sins, or
never receiv'd God's pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mercy.</p>
               <p>Let us uniformly obey the
Commands of Christ. We
must stoop to his Power as
our Judg; <hi>As I live saith the
Lord, every knee shall bow to
me, and every Tongue shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to God;</hi> 'tis our Wisdom
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100548:53"/>
therefore to yield Obedience
to his Authority as our Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver.
<hi>He is the Author of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Salvation to all who obey
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us faithfully improve
all our Talents, all the means
and advantages to serve and
glorify him, for the Account
will be strict, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
infinite. Briefly, let us
learn this point of Wisdom
of our spiritual Enemy, who,
because his <hi>time is short,</hi> is
more active and vigilant to
do Mischief; so considering
our opportunity of doing
good is short, and the omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
irreparable,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>let us with zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
diligence always abound in
the Work of the Lord, knowing
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100548:54"/>
that our Labour shall not be in
vain in the Lord.</hi> O that Men
were wise to consider their
Mortality and Immortality:
to do those things now, which
in the last and great Day they
shall wish they had done.</p>
               <p>I shall now, as the present
occasion directs, speak of the
deceased Mr. <hi>BENJAMIN
ASHURST,</hi> of whose Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
there are very valuable
Testimonies. He had the
Felicity to be instructed and
order'd in his early and obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious
Age by a wise and
holy Father: and as usually
the gracious or vicious Habits
of the first Age are transfused
into the next, so his succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100548:54"/>
Life was correspondent
to his Education. There is
a fit resemblance between
the natural Culture of the
Earth and the moral of our
Minds: Three things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
to make the Earth
fruitful, a good Soil, good
Culture, and good Seed; so
by Analogy, that Education
may be successful, a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed
Nature, an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and good Instructer,
and the Precepts of Religion
and Vertue are necessary. All
these concurr'd in the present
Subject. Some by a rare
Priviledg are exempted from
those tyrannous Passions that
so frequently disorder the
Lives of Men; and in their
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100548:55"/>
Childhood are of such mild
and gaulless Spirits, so recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of vertuous Impressions,
that at the sight of their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
and Carriage we
may have a conjecture of the
Felicity of the innocent State,
of which one Ray, or rather
Shadow, is so amiable. With
such a happy Temper God
was pleased to endow our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
Friend: his Spirit was
humble, modest, gentle and
complying with the Counsels
of his gracious Father, who
with tender Care led him in
the way to Heaven. When
he was grown up to the Age
of Vanity, he was preserved
from <hi>youthful Lusts:</hi> His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
was unstained: He
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100548:55"/>
was not swell'd with Pride,
nor ruffled with Passion, nor
disorder'd with Excess. And
as to a judicious Eye, no
Spectacle is more deformed
than an old Man in whom
the Vices of Youth are noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
levity of Mind, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
of Passions, and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in Conversation: So on
the contrary, there is not a
more amiable sight, than a
young Man in whom the
Vertues of Age are conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous;
a staid Mind, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Desires, a compos'd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment:
and it were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
for the World if foolish
old Men were as rare to be
found, as wise young Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:100548:56"/>
This Praise-worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
when fit to enter into
a particular Calling, was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the Family of a
Turky Merchant: there his
Behaviour was so religious
and serious, that it was said of
him by some that observed
his Actions, that he would
be a Merchant for Heaven.
He after some time went to
<hi>Smyrna,</hi> and preserv'd his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
and Purity in the
midst of Temptations: where
many by vicious Excesses dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage
the Sanctity of the
Christian Religion profess'd
by them, he adorn'd it by the
Sobriety of his Conversation.
He return'd to <hi>England</hi> after
some Years spent beyond Sea,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100548:56"/>
and persever'd in his Christian
Course, serious and solemn
in his Carriage, and ready to
do good to those that wanted
supplies from relieving Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
A few Years after
his return, he fell into a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Consumption that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put a Period to his Days.
In his languishing Disease he
exprest an humble quiet
Submission to the Divine
Disposal: he was silent from
murmuring, but not from
Prayer, which he performed
with solemn Reverence to
the Lord of Life and Death
even in his Weakness. When
the hour of his Departure
was come, he calmly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
his Soul to his faithful
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100548:57"/>
Creator. There is just cause
of Sorrow that one in the
Flower of his Age, of such
hopes, should so suddenly
wither and return to Dust:
if one old in Years and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
a Corrupter of others
by his contagious Example
die, the World is well rid
of him: if a good Man
<hi>comes to the Grave in a full Age,
like as a shock of Corn comes
in his season,</hi> there is cause
of Thanksgiving, that he was
so long a Blessing to the
World: But when a young
Saint dies, that might accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to expectation have
long glorified God upon the
Earth, and been a happy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of doing good, we
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100548:57"/>
should pay our tributary
Tears, and have a due and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
sense of the general Loss.
Yet those who are most near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concern'd, and mournfully
affected should quiet their
troubled Thoughts by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the unaccountable
Will of God, nay, comfort
their sad and dejected Spirits,
by considering, that he has
lived long enough in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
World, who by dying
arrives to Perfection and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.</p>
