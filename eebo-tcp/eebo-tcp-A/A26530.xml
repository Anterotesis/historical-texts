            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GRatitude is as eſſentially neceſſary to a Poet as wit: For, of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
they generally ſhare the hardeſt Fortunes, and were they
not ſometimes relieved by the generous Few, might utterly ſtarve
and periſh: And ſince nothing can be expected from them, but the
poor Returns of Thanks, What Monſters were they, ſhould they
neglect the paying ſo ſmall a Tribute; and how odious muſt they ſeem in the
Eyes of all Men, ſtain'd with Ingratitude: 'Tis with them as with Common
Beggars, where the Donor may rationally demand not only Thanks but Prayers,
he has an unqueſtionable Right to 'em, and to wrong him of 'em, were as hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
as picking his Pocket.</p>
            <p>I need not tell the World, your Grace has for many years been the beſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
of the beſt Poets, and that your Grace has the largeſt and trueſt Soul
of Bounty and Generoſity of any Man living, that would be needleſs; 'tis like
ſhewing Men the Sun at Noon-Day: Yet I hope I may ſo far preſume upon your
Grace's Modeſty, as to ſay, None has more largely taſted of it than my ſelf: I
will not ſay, your Grace has fed me upon all Occaſions; yet I muſt declare I
have din'd at your Table when all the world beſides have denied me a Morſel of
Bread. But your Grace's Bounty do's not end here; Your Grace has not only
reliev'd the Poets in general, but the beſt and moſt learned part of the World
beſides; for, not to reckon the vaſt Shoals of Debtors, Priſoners, Stray-Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices,
Bailiffs, Sharpers, Rooks, Pimps, Gameſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that daily eat of
your Bread and drink of your Drink; a great and vaſt Number of Divines,
Caſuiſts, Projectors, Painters, Muſicians, Rhetoricians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are daily main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
at your Graces Table; and 'tis this thing that ſingles your Grace out
from the reſt of Mankind, and your Grace is more known by your Acts of
Hoſpitality than ever <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great was by all his Conqueſts. The Tables
your Grace do's every Day ſupport and uphold, are almoſt innumerable; for,
beſides the moſt noted ones in <hi>Lincolns-Inn-Fields, Covent-Garden, St. James's
Park,</hi> &amp;c. Your Grace has ſeveral in <hi>Moor-fields, Goodmans-fields, Tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi>
&amp;c. and all ſo well furniſh'd and ſet out, that your Grace's Bounty
ſeems as unlimited as the Sun; and if ſo, how impoſſible is it for us to be fuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently

            <p>I Queſtion not but thou wilt wonder to find <hi>Aeſop</hi> has ſo
ſuddenly croſs'd the Water, and that he is now at
<hi>Richmond,</hi> eſpecially at the latter end of the Seaſon,
when it might reaſonably have been preſum'd he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſufficiently purg'd his Brain at <hi>Tunbridge:</hi> However, I
can aſſure thee, here he is; nay, and what's more, I have
drank with him, and, upon my word, think him a very honeſt,
loyal, witty, good natur'd Fellow. He told me privately, he
had been inform'd, that ſome of his Works had been, directly
againſt his Will, rendred diſguſtful and obnoxious to the
beſt of Kings and Governments: So, for the future, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
neither to ſpeak Fables, or talk Politicks, but in
harmleſs Doggrel, by way of Satyr, (for be muſt ſhow his
Teeth ſtill) point at leſſer Follies: He added, that he
was beholden, not only to the Poets and Painters for repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
him to the World with ſuch Charms, as a Scythe-Leg,
Beetle-Brow, Goggle-Eye, Blobber-Lip, ſwarthy Phiz, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
when (ſays he) turning about, I'm as well ſhap'd as your
VVorſhip, or any <hi>Jack Pudding</hi> of 'em all; but I may requite
their Civilities, and with that, in a great Rage, he paid his
Reckoning and went away.</p>
            <p>But ſetting all this aſide (moſt dear and gentle Reader)
I have n't one word to give thee on behalf of what follows,
nor one Reaſon for writing it (ſave that the Toy took me
i'th' Crown) and I care as little what becomes on't as a VVhore
of her dropp'd Child, ſo thou mayſt uſe it at thy Mercy.</p>
