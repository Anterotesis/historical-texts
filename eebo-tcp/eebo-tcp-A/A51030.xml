            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>AFTER many discourses between him and me, in which he seemed to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionately concerned for my having been a prisoner so long (which I told him was nigh Four years both in <hi>Waterford</hi> and here,) he adding; said, he much lamented my misfortunes, by reason that my face pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised that I was no ordinary person, and that there could be no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter torment in the World than for a generous Soul to be debarred of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and pent up in a close, stincking and loathsome confinement. He went on, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96788:2"/>
I would soon procure you as much Money as will set you at liberty and put you in a good equipage, if you will condescend to some things to be by me proposed; In answer whereunto, I said I should willingly embrace the offer, provided it was both legal and possible; and so bad him continue his discourse, who replyed, you must First take an Oath of Secrecy, it being a matter of Weight and Consequence, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he durst not acquaint me with it. After a short pause, I imagined by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding discourse that it might be some grand Design he had to inform me of, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon seeing me at a stand, he then said, you seem to be scrupulous of what I endeavour for your enlargement; but be assured, if you will be rul'd by me, you are and shall be a happy Man; and so he drew out of his pocket a small Bible or Testament, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to me this following Oath, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <q>
                           <hi>I</hi> Conjure you by our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, by his bitter death and passion, by the Blessed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and all the Blessed and Holy Saints and Angels, by the Holy Mother the Church, by this Sacred Scripture, and as you hope for Salvation, if you do not act what I shall by and by tell you, at least that you keep it concealed during life without any Equivocation, Dissimulation, or mental Reservation, so help you God and all his Holy Saints. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                        </q>
                        <p>After this he said you cannot but be sensible that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the only Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, Apostolick, and unfeigned Church, and the Pope, being God's Vicegerent on earth, hath power to pardon and forgive all sinners that are members of the said Church, be their sins never so great and heinous; I question not but you believe all this, and that there is not, nay cannot be any Salvation for any one but such as die in the Roman-Catholick faith, therefore consequently whoever believes any other than what is allowed by the said Church are not only Heriticks but damned to the pit of Hell, as being the just reward of their demerits; for as there is but one God so there is but one Church of which the Pope is Christ on earth. Now to swear any thing against any of those Hereticks for the Catholick good is to do God service, and that Oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken upon a Protestant Bible needs no scruple of conscience nor inward remorse, it being all one as to swear on an <hi>Aesop's Fables.</hi> Besides, what you swear in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Catholicks (especially in these times) though never so false, yet by a power from the Pope to every Priest in Orders is fully, clearly and absolutely pardoned and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given by their absolution, after Confession to any such Priest. Now what I would have you to do, and whereby you shall obtain your liberty, is as followeth. <hi>In primis,</hi> you must swear that several Heretical Ministers, <hi>viz.</hi> One Parson <hi>Jack</hi> and Dr. <hi>Harrison,</hi> since your being in Prison here in <hi>Dublin,</hi> came to you and offered to pay your debts, and support you with Money to carry on your designs, if you would make Affidavit as follows, and that they brought it to you in writing, and caused you to copy it out, and took the original along with them (<hi>The words</hi>) That there was a Popish Plot, and that they desired you to swear that some Priests and others (naming any one that you know) told you that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was so far concerned in the Plot as that he sided with the Pope and French King, to introduce the French to invade the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to put the King to Death, and to murder all Protestants in his Majesties Dominions, and to bring in the Popish Religion; and that they, the said He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, should farther require you to say, that you have divers times heard Papists de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that they would bring it about to be a Presbyterian Plot, and so subborn Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses against the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> First, and then against the Duke <hi>Monmouth</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Protestants, and bring their Heads to the Block. He farther said, that the King would easily believe this Information, by reason he would gladly have any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to destroy them, as being the People that murdered his Father. Also he said, you must swear that the said Ministers, <hi>viz. Jack</hi> and Dr. <hi>Harris,</hi> or <hi>Harrison,</hi> called his Majesty Papist, that he designed the Distruction of his Subjects, and to establish the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Religion in his Dominions, and that they plainly perceived his intention was to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96788:2"/>
bring his said: Subjects under a Tyrannical Government, and that they and the rest of their Brethren intended e're this time to have had him (meaning the King) in their power, and to have disposed of him at their pleasure, nay to have made him shorter by the head, if he had not condescended to all their designs; but failing in their designs were resolved to spend their lives and fortunes to make it out a Popish Plot, by which (said the above Father) we will make the world believe there was no Popish Plot but a Presbyterian Plot, and they will be utterly confounded, and we cleared, and all Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians and other like Dissenters, be accused not only of the said Plot, but be reputed guilty of all the Blood that hath been spilt. If you will undertake this, you need not doubt but that you shall have the Prayers of the Catholick Church to prosper you; and besides other Witnesses shall be procured to second this your Information without any show or colour of suspicion, if by Gold and Silver they may be obtained.</p>
                        <p>Further, said he, the Catholick Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> have already given large sums of Money, to subborn Witnesses against the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>; forty will appear against him, and see how it is likely to go with him; and you will be assisted beyond expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for we are all resolved to make it a Presbyterian Plot; and it is as easie for you to carry on this business, as it is for you to say the <hi>Pater-Noster.</hi> So I told him I did not know the above Parson <hi>Jack</hi> or Dr. <hi>Harris,</hi> or <hi>Harrison.</hi> Then quoth he, you must write to them, and in your Letters say, that you have been a leud and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sinner, and that you have been a long time out of the way, and now, God touching you with an inward Remorse of Conscience, you desire them to come to you for Christ Jesus sake, to administer some Spiritual comfort to you, and you'l be sure to have them come to you, they being the notedst of their Function, where they are: And after they have been with you, and been seen with you by others in this House, it is enough for this business, and will turn to the ruin of themselves, and many thousands of them, whose Blood I hope to live to see spilt by the hands of the Catholicks; and I am certain, in three years time, things will be so effectually done, that there will not be a Protestant living in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland.</hi> After you have made this Affidavit to the King and Council, there shall be a large allowance, during your Life, given you; for the Pope, Jesuits, and our Clergy will contribute largely to any one that will prove so faithful, as to prosecute any thing in the like kind; and for your part, you will meet with no Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but be credited, you being an <hi>English-man,</hi> and none in <hi>England</hi> knowing you to be a Catholick, wich you must always deny, and you will be dispensed with for your so doing. Moreover he would now take his leave, and leave me to consider of it, and that he expected I would give him an absolute answer the next morning, but I desired seven days time, which with much ado he consented to, putting me in mind, for my Souls sake, not to reveal it, if I would not do it; but said he, if you wll do it at the seven days end, after you have confessed and received the Holy Sacrament of Christ, to be true and just in this affair, you shall know from me more at large, and be at liberty, and have Money and Cloaths like a Gentleman: so he made a short <hi>extempore</hi> Prayer, exhorting me to a true performance, adding, how dangerous it would be for me to prove false, and so went away. But coming at the seven days end, I told him my Conscience could not do it: Well, said he, (after a deep sigh) you are damned to Eternity if you disclose it (which indeed I promised not to do) then he told me that they must get some other, for they had enough to do it at their command, and taking his leave, he bad me to send to him for any thing I wanted, and I should have it freely. I do acknowledge all this to be an unfeigned truth, and that I never saw or heard from the said <hi>Jack</hi> or Dr. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> alias <hi>Harrison,</hi> all my life long, but when I had spoken to one of my Fellow Prisoners, of this business, one Captain <hi>Page</hi> being told of it, came to me, desiring this Relation: But I never saw them; yet it is true, I cannot be positive in the day of the Month, but God knows it is exact, as near as I can call to mind: And I declare to the World, there is nothing causes me to do this but a good Conscience, and to make known the obscure
