         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(though at the worst hand) the

many, whom nothing (if not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

by that meane a sword (as the prouerbe is)
annointed with honie; inferring therby not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a sweetnesse, by retaining them mingled with
danger; but also, that howsoeuer she gouerned;
whether by lenitie or rigor, they as a people im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient

would either with the crabfish, being held loosly
creepe forth; or hard strained with the eele slip
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:5468:4"/>
away: by meane whereof she might not onely
liue doubtfull of them; but also for their sakes,
raise a cruel and vntractable enemie against her.</p>
            <p>These things (as noting the iniurious sclaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of this time) I proposed in the presence of
diuers, amongst whom there was then by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
a gentleman of those parts named PHILE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON,
who after long fixing his eyes on me, with
such countenance as he had againe beheld the
deepe wounds of his countrey newly bleeding;
at last turned to the rest and said. Nothing (Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen)
hath in this life bene dearer to me then
the libertie of my countrey, the which with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
whilst I might, I endeuored to make eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall:
neither had we failed to effect so much, had
not the ambition of strangers, meeting with our
discension, brought forth the first fruicts of our
miseries: since which time our prouinces haue
bene so tost with the contrarie winds of fortune,
that fewe could keepe their ores, or holde the
sterne of gouernement: for whilst many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded,
fewer hauing learned to obey, we
were distracted into sundrie fauors: some as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
acquainted with the condition of libertie,
preferring the title of Burgu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>die, some the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
of the Empire, some of France, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:5468:4"/>
others the alliance with England, each one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing
their apologies, either in the conceits
of Guses, Patriats, or malcontents: by meane
whereof all parts in steed of our countrey sports,
were so filled with tokens of warre, that no place
was left for good men to bewaile this change.
But when after long deliberation, we had, as wel
for our vnion with you in matters of religion, as
our present necessitie both of defence and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of trafficke, cast our selues into the armes
of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: some hope remained of better speed
had not the diuision of opinions for a time stayd
her Maiesties laudable endeuors: during which
consultation, the Duke of Parma hauing spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilier
deliberated, bereued vs of Antwerpe (the
key of our prouinces) by which he hath since
entered other townes and forts of account. And
though we tooke hurt by her Maiesties cuncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
who according to her wonted pietie, sought
to reconcile our prouinces to Spaine, yet we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted
not any thing that might concerne ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our ancient alliance, or duties of subiectes,
but haue preferred the honor of her nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any, as our importunat sute to be shadowed
vnder her wing of iustice, and our seruice dayly
attendant, haue made apparant. After which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:5468:5"/>
speeches PHILEMON with his eyes full of teares
turning againe towards me, said, How miserable
is our time in which auarice and tyrannie keepe
weight, &amp; are higher priced then honestie? and
wherein wolues quarrell with lambes for trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the streame: and the mouth, hands, and
other members conspire against the belly? and
herein moreouer is our sorow inexplicable, that
whilst her Maiesty endeuored to haue due place
among the best Princes, and we to liue in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of good subiectes, that yet both haue bene
subiect to one sclaunder, farre vnmeete for her
royall dignitie, our innocencie and loyaltie. To
which I answered. It is true PHILEMON that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
by often lying beleeue they speake the only
oracles of God, by meane whereof all good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises
are either suppressed, or so obscured,
that the light of honour due to them and their
authors, seemes either eclipsed, or cleane put
out: a practise drawen, as I thinke, from the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of ill women, who to be lesse blamed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
all vertuous and chast matrons of lightnes,
and herein is our disgrace the greater, in that we
haue bred those birds that haue not onely peckt
at our eyes, but also haue defiled their owne nest
with all infamie, not fearing (though they would
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:5468:5"/>
seeme the louing sonnes of our countrey, and
readie sacrifices for her health) to be the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
pensioners of Spaine, iniuriously repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that the motions of that kingdome, are for
matter of religion, her Maiesties fauors towards
your people, and her enterprise into the VVest
Indies: slanders of so apparant danger, the same
extenuating the precedent auarice and ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of Spaine, meeting with the ill humors of our
people, that I maruell those feigners should no
lesse in their conuenticles lament their practise,
then Cicero wondered the Aruspices could in
deluding the people, forbeare laughter behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
one another. To which PHILEMON; the
sunne hath not beheld anie thing more vnseme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then this pretence of iustice, cloked with a
deepe desire of noueltie: those rumors being
not onely factious, but also false, and regarding
the time, full of perill and danger, as you EPOE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NETVS,
said he, may know, if you loke but as far
as the emperour Charles the fift, when Granuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus
in our prouinces, and Philip not long after
in this realme, sought to make our golden fleece
and your Lion a pray for the Egles of Austria.</p>
            <p>Then I. I am not ignorant PHILEMON of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
for whilst all places (as with bright tropheis
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:5468:6"/>
of papacie) were lightened with the burnt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the people; Philip hoised his first saile of
ambition, which as a skilfull maister he bare so
lowe, that many fauored his course, and wished
him the good windes of fortune, especially his
wife Mary, who being perswaded by him, it wold
greatly aduance her authority, were he crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and made her companion of dignity, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
endeuored (not knowing howe much
that ceremony would preiudice her succession)
to effect his purpose. To this she was also great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
incited by the clergie, who to make sure their
particular, by that mean, cared not to hazard the
generall state of the realme. But the Lords, who
by an ancient policie had greater interest in
matters of gouernement, hauing more cause to
regard the reputation of their houses (likely to
diminish by his neighbourhood) then the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats
their momentanie dignities, withstood it as
a matter dangerous, and not without common
perill. This purpose being ouerthrowne by their
prouidence, he taketh occasion by tumults hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
about that season, to perswade his wife
to new matter, seeming not only profitable, but
also necessarie for both, alledging that he often
departing this realme for the affaires of his own
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:5468:6"/>
countries, could not without danger performe
the parts of a louing husband towards her, the
blockhouses standing which might prohibit his
returne, and the want of common fauor remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
For greater credit whereof he cited a late
act then of the valorous Baron the Lord VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Howard of Effingham high Admiral of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
who being sent to conduct him with the
nauie, brought the kings ship in perill, by deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
some great shot, for that he wouldnot, as
the custome is, strike saile, by which ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
he was to acknowledge the Queenes so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigntie
in these seas. I was, said PHILE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON,
at that time in the shipping of our country
with the Spanish fleete, and know that to be the
onely cause why that noble Baron was after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued
from his romth: but proceed EPOENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVS.
This motion (said I, returning where I left)
seeming iust, was forthwith effected: and what
lets soeuer to his returne, either rased, or transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into his seuerall countries, vnder colour of
furnishing him for the warres of France: so that
for atchieuing his intention (hauing the fauor of
his wife and Prelats) he wanted litle more then
time (we being in a manner disarmed) to be
made absolute, &amp; to apply the significant posie
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:5468:7"/>
of the golden fleece, PRETIVM NON VILE
LABORIS, to the order of our George &amp; Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which perhaps (being toucht in conscience
with the honorable deuice and meaning of our
order, HON Y SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE)
he would haue refused.</p>
            <p>These proceedings were then suspected as
tending to disbranch the naturall cions to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffe
him selfe, which he had in nearer sort at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
had he not bene tript by the death of
his wife. And notwithstanding that he had ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
lost many occasions of time and place, and
that his pray readie to be deuoured, was by that
meane taken from betweene his teeth, he yet
desisted not to take occasion by the forehead,
when, and wheresoeuer he met her: for which
cause, and to impresse an opinion in all nations
of his right to our countrey, he ioyned manie
yeares after her Maiesties happie enterance to
the Royall seate, the title of England with that
of his own dominions: which could not be with
any good meaning, or without great preiudice
to her Maiestie, her heires, &amp; lawfull successors.</p>
            <p>These things are well knowen to manie yet
liuing: neither will the Spaniards by colour of
the authoritie they had gotten amongst vs, deny
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:5468:7"/>
it as a thing vniust, considering that the limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of tyrants consisteth in things they can not
get: but if these good bodies should (appealing
to the fauor of malcontents) complaine they are
sclandered, let vs enter into a scrutiny of times,
and we shall find them charged with the muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
artillerie, and other abillements of warre,
which could not be embezeled to any other end
then the increase of their empire. But if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
the hauing of it, or that they had it to any
such vse, I will ioyne with them in issue for both.
If they had it not, let them (they running through
the store of the realme) accompt how it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed.
For Henrie the eight, being one of the
victorious kings of that age, &amp; stil in action with
France and Scotland, (the least of which is able
to abate the high thoughts of a proud enemie)
could not, in respect of his conquests, be vnfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
of prouision to withstand the power of so
great aduersaries. Agayne the time betweene
this triumphant king, &amp; his daughter Mary was
(in regard of our expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) but short, in which
there was no diminution of any thing within the
realme, as might appeare as well by the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of that good king Edward, being the hope
of Europe, as his bettering of the gold, and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:5468:8"/>
coines. But how great her Maiesties charges
grew by a new prouision of all thing immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after her royall entrie, no man is ignorant, no
not strangers: the dukes Memorancie and Cassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
greatly praising, vpon their view only of her
store in the Tower, her carefull and most wise
prouidence; which they would not haue done
had they knowen any part thereof not to haue
bene of her Maiesties cost. Now the question is
to be asked of these temperat persons (our war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
furniture being at that time their king ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with her Maiesties sister Mary comparable
with any of the greatest Princes of the west part)
who eloigned the same? I must answere for them
(they being occupied in hastening the fift mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie)
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they who haue vowed to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate
our country, and to murder a most sacred
and Christian Princesse.</p>
            <p>The seisure of armour, treasure and munition
with the rasure of places defensiue vpon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of peace; is an old stratageme, and vsed by
the Turke in the times of his fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dship with them,
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he mindeth to subdue: which if any would
excuse in the Spaniard as a matter impossible to
his iustice: how aunswere they his vsurpation of
the title of this realme, often reproued by Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:5468:8"/>
Man, her Maiesties liger in Spaine, to the
great hazard of his person, as I heard him and
some of his traine affirme, before the same was
laid a part. But they may replie, that hee being
permitted during his abode in this kingdome
by generall assent to vse that title, might without
her Maiesties preiudice continue the same. But
there we may, as the prouerbe is, lay a straw: for
whatsoeuer is allowed by any authoritie, may
be disanulled by the same: againe, the causes of
any thing ceassing, the effectes of the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
no further: whereby may be concluded,
that not onely the Princes and people of this
kingdome, by whose fauors hee had that title,
haue power to retract the same; but also that his
wife dying without issue by him, could leaue
Phillip no greater interest then she had; which
was but for terme of her naturall life.</p>
            <p>These matters, say they (for that they haue
made their will a law) require neither aunswere
nor excuse: no more doth their bost made seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
yeares past in the duke of Parmas Camp before
men of account (who by the great prudence of
that honorable cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>seller Sir Francis VValsing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
now dead, were appointed for speciall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
to that place) that they would leaue their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:5468:9"/>
trade to Peru, our countrie being a shorter cut,
from whence they might drawe equall treasure.
At this time there was no speache of religion,
neither of her Maiesties alliance with the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlanders,
or of Sir Francis Drake (who as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
had not bene in the Indies) but of their auarice,
crueltie, and ambition; the effectes of which,
preceded any acte done by her Maiestie, whose
mildnesse of neighbourhood and contentment
of state, haue exceeded the temperance of all
Princes of this or anie other age.</p>
            <p>Now gentlemen, said I, consider of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
proceedings, which were broched in the
time of papacie, and our greatest deuotion to
Philip and his nation: before either the reesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment
of the reformed religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties
receiuing the Netherlanders, for their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
alliance with her kingdome, into her saue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
or anie enterprise made into the Indies by
her authoritie.</p>
            <p>VVeigh moreouer the state and qualitie of
iustice, which, whether she gouerneth betwene
nations, or a people of one countrey, neuer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
anie law, or punisheth by the same, till of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
be committed:<note place="margin">Exod. cap. 24. sect. 4. &amp; 7.</note> which law must then also
be recieued by the generall and free consent of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:5468:9"/>
nations and people.</p>
            <p>Iudge also whether his enterprises do stand
with his pretence of pietie, for if he had bene (as
he feigneth) deuoured with the zeale of his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
were there not great occasions giuen him
in the time of the French king Charles the ninth
his brother in law and neighbour, to shew some
effects of his Catholike title, Cassimer then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
France twise, vpon the onely pay of the
French king? Nay hath he not since then main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
at his charge the Dukes of GVISE and
MAINE against his other brother in law Henrie
the third, a deuout Romanist, and chiefe ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader
at the great murder in Paris? yea &amp; which
more is, hath he not consented to the murder of
the said Henrie (I will not say procured it) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
to the dignity of all kings? did he after (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the iustice &amp; custome of good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
either reproue the Duke du Maine or his
complices for that fact? or hath he not since the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
aided the said Duke rather more openly then
before, not only with treasure, but also with soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
sent from the duke of Parma? To co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude,
hath not his policie bene by nourishing factions
in that and our realme, to be made absolute in
the west contine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Europe &amp; Ilands adiacent?
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:5468:10"/>
and hath he not for that purpose renewed his
league with the Turke, who slily smiling at his
madnesse, panteth to deuour him and the rest of
Christendome by that meane? No man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
it, time hath proued it, &amp; the bloud of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
crieth against it.</p>
            <p>A reformation then of Religion, or our ill
neighbourhood to him, are no causes of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(he hauing plotted our ruine, and rasure of
his Catholike alie, in his neerest friendship with
both) but the auarice, crueltie, and pride of his
people, which neither the penurie of Spaine can
satisfie, or the Pyrene hilles, or wide Ocean can
limit.</p>
            <p>Beleeue me EPOENETVS (said PHILEMON)
a gentleman of good qualitie tolde me, that he
heard in Rome that the cardinall named Buono
compagno (called since then, Pope Gregorie)
being demanded at his returne from Spain, how
he liked that kingdome: answered, there were
plaines of luxurie, vales of miserie, and hilles of
pride.</p>
            <p>To which I answered, I am, PHILEMON, easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perswaded to beleeue you, Monsieur la Nouë
a man so wel qualified that few come neere him
in all the vertues, &amp; not one goeth beyond him
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:5468:10"/>
in anie, confirming some part thereof.</p>
            <p>This noble gentleman composing during his
captiuitie amongst the Spaniards diuerse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
both politike and martiall,<note place="margin">Paradoxe troisiesme.</note> notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that he giueth honorable testimonie of
their discipline, drawne from the great fortunes
and military prudence of the Emperor Charles
the fift, yet affirmeth that verie often one shall
heare in their armies a new souldier but of three
crownes pay the moneth, say in great maiestie
(if he hath not those fauors he expecteth) that he
is as good as the king: he further for proofe of
their insolencie maketh this question: what will
then a Captaine do, in like case, that hath bene
found at assaults and battailes? He will, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
la Nouë, say I am better then the Pope. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
this figure, may our countrimen, who are yet
free, frame their argument of word and fact a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them that would make them captiue; that
honorable and famous person speaking so libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
of their pride in his durance. They may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
foresee what insolencie the great officers of
Spaine would vse towards strangers, their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
companions standing amongst themselues,
so much vpon their pantofles, we may be also
perswaded, that they who compare with their
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:5468:11"/>
naturall king, will smally esteeme their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which trafficke the state of their countrey:
vnlesse they may after maintaine that amitie
which they haue gained by gold, by their water
imperiall, drawne from the hardnesse of iron:
many hauing bene pleased with the foule plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of some in the night, whose beauties, they
haue after lothed in the day.</p>
            <p>Then PHILEMON: I would EPOENETVS
that all men were (for the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quiet) of your
mind: nothing breeding a greater resolution in
this sort, then to thinke they are esteemed sacred
of them, by whose promises they are corrupted:
as though they were of the deepest trust, which
haue offended in the highest degree of trechery</p>
            <p>They are not PHILEMON, said I, tyrants (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they make no semblant thereof) euer
fearing those by whom they are aduanced: Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip
of Macedonia allowing for his profite those
that would betray their countrey, but not those
that had betrayed it. And for that their greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is seldome satisfied, whose countrey con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth
them not, it may be still doubted (no
place being esteemed so deare as the place of
birth and education) that their lightnesse can
not be stayed by change; but rather impaired by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:5468:11"/>
loosing their first faith: the iust recompence of
which, amongst those that are prudent, is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement.</p>
            <p>Vortiger could well band with this racket,<note place="margin">Flor. Hist.</note> he
putting to death an hundred Picts at one bandy,
whom he procured to kil the king Constantius.</p>
            <p>Selim the great Turke had also great skill at
this game;<note place="margin">Sans. de vitis Tur.</note> who promising Vstarabi a phisition,
ten Duckets a day during his life, to poison his
father Baisit the second, did for recompence of
the fact, cut of his head, saying, the phisition
would no more spare him then he did his father,
if anie would require him.</p>
            <p>The like Caesar Borgia the Spaniard practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with Messire Remiro Dorco, whom he only
vsed in all murders, treasons, and oppressions of
the people.</p>
            <p>If this were the bountie of tyrants to traitors,
good kings I hope will not be behind them in
iust punishments, whom they haue exceeded in
due mainteining iustice: as the testimonies of
Dauid that caused the Amalec to dy that bosted
to haue slaine Saul;<note place="margin">Reg. 2. cap. 1.</note> and of good Dane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutus,
who (being companion in this kingdom
with Edmond, named for his cheualry Ironside)
put to death Eudricus the Saxon, who had slain
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:5468:12"/>
his soueraigne, to bring the whole empire into
Canutus hands,<note place="margin">Flor. Hist.</note> do plentifully witnesse.</p>
            <p>These are, said PHILEMON, presidents of rare
iustice, &amp; most excellent to be followed of them
that care to maintaine the high reputation of
their calling: for according to the opinion of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilians,
who affirme, that their lawes permit a
ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tleman to make any iniury done to one of his
order, no lesse his, then if it were profered him
selfe: which interest and similitude of dignitie
(were it duly regarded by persons of equalitie)
would greatly abate the bold offers of these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbers
of gouernement: as well for that they
ariue not amisse either into the handes of bad,
or good Princes in regard of chastiseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as that
wise kings may suspect, that as they many times
rise, they may also fall by factious followers: to
whom (in respect of their countries health) to
neglect money,<note place="margin">Adelpho. Act. 2.</note> would be sometimes (according
to the comicall Poet) a great gaine.</p>
            <p>Then I. It is most true, that where this moath
of faction entereth, she eateth through the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of peace, whether of the long or short
robe. Of this opinion was that noble gentleman
Monsieur du Lant, who (being sent by the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch
king Lewes the 12. into Italie to restore diuers
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:5468:12"/>
castels to the Florentins, take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from them by the
Duke Valentino, and the Vitelli in the vales of
Treuere and Chiana; and finding there many
which bosted to be of the faction of one Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoco)
greatly blamed them; alledging that if the
subiectes of Fraunce should name them selues
partakers with the king his Maister (though spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with dutie) they should be chastised, as such
which suppose a contrarie partie in that realme
against the king: an admonition worthie to be
written with letters of gold in publicke places,
as monuments of his singular prudence. For if
the vnitie of eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, humors, or qualities main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth
the life either of bodies naturall, or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke,
it cannot be, but a disagreement doth
breed a resolution, spasme, or some other most
daungerous infirmitie in both. Examples of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie
neede not, we hauing too many that be
moderne of our neare neighbours: amongst
which these tokens of murther, IE SVIS
ROYAL, and, IE SVIS GVISIAN, haue wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
concluded their tragedie.</p>
            <p>For conclusion, to mainteine that the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Spaine issue from our actions, is to make
accent vpon these wordes, I fauour the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard;
which are no lesse to be forborne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:5468:13"/>
I take part with Marzoco, or I am a Guisian; all
foure by implication being of one nature. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
whereof, &amp; that all subiects are to esteeme
their naturall Prince, as the Generall of God: I
would that those who haue not obserued the
course of times, should (with the ancient French
which esteemed all things lawful their kings did
in fauor of the people) humbly reuerence their
Princes proceedings, as his, who standing for
the publike benefite of his countrey, is alwayes
blamelesse, though his pretenses (to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
multitude) haue some shew of iniustice. For
how may he that leadeth a priuate life, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
handled publicke affaires, be able to reason
in things meete, lawfull, or necessarie for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement?
the true knowledge of which, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neere the diuine prouidence, is not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed
in the schooles of Thersites, vnlesse there
be some Vlysses to moderate.<note place="margin">Home. Lib. 2. Ilia.</note> For who so attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth
the effectes of things present, to causes
next going before, may be deceaued with him
who not knowing his patients infirmity, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
neither oister shelles or the parings of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
by which he might coniecture the sick had
surfeted, but after spying a saddle vnder the bed,
feared not to wager his life, that his patient had
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:5468:13"/>
eaten a horse: or more properly, to ascribe the
hostilitie of Spaine to the iniuries of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is to be no lesse mad then he, who thought
his phrensie happened by washing his head the
day before in cold water. For nothing gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
said I, is plainer then that their naturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarice
and pride, and not our iniuries, haue furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
incited the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (according to their embleme
of Burgundie hauing two handes with a steele
and flint stricking fire, with these wordes, Ante
ferit quàm flamma micet) to esteeme no law of
societie, or bond of nature; whereby they may
more securely oppresse all partes by violence
and stealth.</p>
            <p>This hath bene touched by many, but very
aptly by the expert and valiant knight Sir Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
VVilliams, who hauing serued long time in
their warres, hath with quicke colours descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
their crueltie towardes their faithfull serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
not being of their nation. VVith these
therefore that keepe no mediocritie, it is most
daungerous in matter of state, to vse a way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in a meane; the same being neither able
to procure frendes or to propell a weake or fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
enemie.</p>
            <p>VVhich speaches ended, PHILEMON, in the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:5468:14"/>
behalfe of the rest, which seemed by their silence
desirous to depart; answered; well EPOENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVS,
the time rather requiring to consider what
