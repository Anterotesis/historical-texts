            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen an Universal Consternation spreads through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Peace which every man enjoys, becomes dreadful to him; when Mens minds in this dead calm of State, are as busie, as 'tis fear'd, the hands of some wou'd be in the Tempest of a Battel, to see a Poet plotting in his Chamber quite another way, painting fast as vigorous Fancy can inspire him, drawing the past World, the present, and to come, in a narrow space, is an Image not unworthy a grave Man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. It is the business of poor Poets to be the diversion of Mankind; pleasure is their being. I think I may call 'em the Mistresses of the World; which if granted, I am sure 'tis easie to prove their Gallants very brutish, for they generally loath them as soon as they are enjoy'd: The best of 'em come under the severest lash of the greatest Men; nay, the least will be shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Bolts, and when the Mastiffs worry 'em, the little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>urs will be barking; the whole World censures, and ev'ry da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Poet that comes forth, must expect to be like the <hi>Almanack</hi> Hero, all over wounds. For my own part, I have been so harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handl'd by some of 'em, that my Courage quite fail'd me; nor wou'd I now appear in Print, but under the Protection and Patronage of your Lordship. Your Illustrious Forefathers, and indeed all your Eminent Relations, have always been of the First-rate Nobility, Patrons of Wit and Arms, magnificently brave, true old-stampt <hi>Britains,</hi> and ever foremost in the Race of Glory. Not to unravel half your Honourable Records, I challenge all the Men of Fame, to show an Equal to the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Sidney,</hi> ev'n when so many contemporary Worthies flourish'd, I mean Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> the Name still of your Lordship, true Rival of your Honour, one that cou'd match your Spirit, so most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly great, that he refus'd to be a King. He was at once a <hi>Caesar</hi> and a <hi>Virgil,</hi> the leading Souldier, and the foremost Poet, all after this must fail: I have paid just Veneration to his Name, and methinks the Spirit of <hi>Shakespear</hi> push'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100344:3"/>That there are in your Lordship all these Excellent Grains which made this Perfect Man, I think my self bound by reason to tell the World, which to my particular observation and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge has done you wrong. I must acknowledge, that your boiling Youth has made great Salleys; and so did <hi>Alexander,</hi> and our Great Fifth <hi>Henry</hi>: Your Spirit complains as <hi>Alexander</hi>'s did, for Action, who grudg'd his Father's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, as if his Soul was pent, and wanted Elbow-room, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to go Abroad o're Walls, if not through Doors; and Men of Sense laugh at your precise Fellow, your <hi>Cynick</hi> in a Tub, who thwarts the course of Nature, and is never pleas'd, but when he sees grey Heirs upon a young Head. If to be truly Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, ev'n in cold Blood, Magnificent as the old Nobility, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Charitable, modest as Humility it self, the fastest Friend upon Earth, where your Lordship is pleas'd to fix the Honour; if these Ingredients can compound one admirable Man, then may your Lordship stand forth a Monument of lasting Honour. Perhaps for this I shall incur the notion of a Flatterer: Flattery indeed is a Catholick ill, it passes through the World, and suits with all Complexions: 'Tis an insinuating Poyson, a <hi>Iesui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let it suffice, that I imitate the best of Poets in a short but hearty Acknowledgment of my Obligations to your <hi>Lordship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore I hope, as your Lordship's Great Uncle shone upon the mighty <hi>Ben.</hi> with a full Favour, (though my best Merits are not the ten thousand part of his smallest labours) your Lordship's infinite goodness will accept of my honest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, which to your Lordship's Service shall ever be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly offer'd,</p>
