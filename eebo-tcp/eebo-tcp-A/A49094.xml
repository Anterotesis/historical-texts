         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in this Country, that Fire from Heaven is fallen upon a City called
<hi>Balke,</hi> ſcituate on the ſide of the River of <hi>Thames;</hi> where a world of
People have been killed and burned, and Houſes alſo conſumed. This

a <hi>French</hi> Servant of Sir <hi>Vere Vane's,</hi> he haſtily replyed, <hi>You Engliſh Maidens will like
the</hi> French-men <hi>better, when there is not an Houſe left between</hi> London-Bridge <hi>and</hi>
Temple-Bar, which ſhe anſwering, <hi>I hope your Eyes will never ſee that,</hi> He replyed,
<hi>This will come to paſs between</hi> June <hi>and</hi> December.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Tiſdale</hi> informs, that he being, about the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> at the
<hi>Grey-hound</hi> in St. <hi>Martins,</hi> with one <hi>Fitz-Harris</hi> an <hi>Iriſh Papiſt,</hi> He heard him ſay;
<hi>There ſhall be ſad Deſolation in</hi> September, and in <hi>November</hi> a worſe. For in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember
all will be united into one;</hi> hereupon <hi>Tiſdale</hi> asking where this Deſolation
would be, the ſaid Prieſt anſwered him, <hi>in London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Lite</hi> of <hi>Ratcliff,</hi> having ſome Diſcourſe with one Mr. <hi>Langhorne</hi> of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
<hi>Temple,</hi> Barriſter, reputed a zealous Papiſt, about <hi>February</hi> laſt; after ſome
Diſcourſe in diſputing about Religion, he took him by the hand and ſaid to him,
<hi>You expect great things in</hi> 1666. <hi>and think that</hi> Rome <hi>will be deſtroyed; but what if it
be</hi> London?</p>
               <p>One <hi>Kiteley</hi> of <hi>Barking</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> informs, that one <hi>Yaxley</hi> a Papiſt, of <hi>Ilford</hi> in
the ſaid County, came into their Houſe <hi>Auguſt</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi> who falling into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with his Mother, ſaid, <hi>They ſay that next Thurſday, will be the hotteſt day that
ever was in</hi> England. She replyed, <hi>I hope the hotteſt Seaſon of the year is now paſt.</hi> To
which he anſwered; <hi>I know not whether it be the hotteſt for Weather or Action:</hi> The
ſaid <hi>Yaxley,</hi> coming to the ſame Houſe, the week after the Fire, Mr. <hi>Kitely</hi> ſaid
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64490:3"/>
to him with ſome trouble; <hi>I have often thought upon your hot Thurſday,</hi> To which
ſhe replyed, <hi>It was not indeed upon the Thurſday but it hapned upon the Sunday come
ſevennnigt after;</hi> Mr. <hi>Yaxley</hi> bearing theſe Evidences produced againſt her, prompted
her to avoid the words, ſaying, that upon the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> ſhe did tell Mr. <hi>Kitely,
That they ſay next Thurſday, will be the darkeſt Thurſday, that ever was in</hi> England,
<hi>but not otherwiſe;</hi> Which ſhe affirms to have received from one <hi>Fynchman.</hi> An old
Woman of <hi>Ilford,</hi> who next being examined before a Juſtice of Peace, to diſcover
the Truth thereof, denyed that ever ſhe ſaid any ſuch words to Mrs. <hi>Yaxley,</hi> or
that ſhe had any diſcourſe with her about any ſuch Matter; as to the ſubſequent
words ſhe the ſaid <hi>Yaxley</hi> denyed ever to have ſpoken them, but Mr. <hi>Kitely</hi> offered
in her Preſence, if it ſhould be demanded, to bring his Mother and Wife to teſtifie
the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>William Ducket</hi> Member of the Houſe, Informs that one <hi>Henry Baker of Chipnam,</hi>
in the County of <hi>Wilts,</hi> coming from Market with one <hi>John Woodman</hi> of <hi>Rolloway</hi>
in the ſame County, the Thurſday before the Fire began in <hi>London,</hi> they had
ſome Diſcourſe about buying a Yoke of fat Bullocks, which <hi>Woodman</hi> was to ſell,
and was deſired by <hi>Baker</hi> to keep them a while in his hands, but <hi>Woodman</hi> replied
that he would not ſtay ſo long in the County, whereupon <hi>Baker</hi> demanding whither
he was going? he refuſed to tell; asking, <hi>What he had to do to ask that Queſtion?</hi>
And riding a little farther, the ſaid <hi>Woodman</hi> expreſſed theſe words; <hi>You brave
Blades of Chipnam, you made Bonfires lately for beating the Dutch, but ſince you delight
in Bonfires, you ſhall have your belly full of them ere it be long;</hi> adding, <hi>that if he lived but
one week longer, he ſhould ſee</hi> London <hi>as ſad a</hi> London <hi>as ever it was ſince the World
began, and in ſome ſhort time after, he ſhould ſee as bloody a time in</hi> England, <hi>as ever
was ſince</hi> England <hi>was</hi> England: This diſcourſe was not much taken notice of
at that time when it was ſpoken; but when the City of <hi>London</hi> was burning, the
ſaid <hi>Baker</hi> gave this Imformation to the ſaid <hi>Ducket;</hi> hereupon was iſſued out a
Warrant to apprehend <hi>Woodman,</hi> but he was gone out of the Country, and cannot
be yet heard of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert Hubert,</hi> of <hi>Roan</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> confeſſed that he was one of thoſe
that fired the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> a Baker in <hi>Pudding-Lane,</hi> from whence the Fire
had its beginning; and alſo ſayes, that he came out of <hi>France</hi> with one <hi>Stephen
Pedilow,</hi> about four Months before the Fire began in <hi>London,</hi> and went into <hi>Sweed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
with him, where he ſtayed alſo with him as his Companion four Moneths,
and then they came together into <hi>England</hi> in a Sweediſh Ship, called the <hi>Skipper,</hi>
where he ſtayed on Board with the ſaid <hi>Pedilow,</hi> till that Saturday night on which
the Fire broke out, where <hi>Pedilow</hi> taking him out of the Ship, carryed him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Pudding-lane,</hi> and he being earneſt to know whither he was carrying him, he
would not ſatisfie him, till he brought him to the Place, and then he told him that
he had brought three Balls, and gave him one of them into his hand to throw into
the Houſe, but he deſiring further Satisfaction about that Deſign before he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Pedilow</hi> began to chaff and would not hear him, ſeeing which, <hi>Hubert</hi> conſents,
and according to his Orders puts the Fire-ball to the end of a long Pole, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had lighted it with a Match, he put it in at the Window, and there ſtaid
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64490:3"/>
till he ſaw the Houſe on a flame; to this Fact he confeſſes three Accomplices
whereof <hi>Pedilow</hi> to be chief.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Graves,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Merchant, living in St. <hi>Mary Ax,</hi> informs; That he had
known <hi>Hubert</hi> ever ſince he was four year old, and he ever obſerved him to be a
Perſon of a miſchievous inclination, and therefore fit for any villanous enterpriſe,
and becauſe of the knowledge he had of him, he went to viſit him in Priſon; when
he ſaw him, he could not but commiſerate his condition, whereinto he had brought
himſelf; and for his better diſcovery of the Fact, he told him the ſaid <hi>Hubert,</hi> that
he did not believe that he had done that Fact which he had confeſſed himſelf guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of, to which <hi>Hubert</hi> replyed, <hi>Yes, I am guilty of it; and have been brought to it by
the Inſtigation of</hi> Pedilow, <hi>and not out of any malice to the Engliſh Nation, but from a
deſire of that Reward he promiſed me, upon my return into</hi> France. [It is obſervable,
that this miſerable Creature, who confeſſed himſelf before the Commiſſioners to
be a Proteſtant, was a Papiſt, and dyed ſo;] and as to the aforeſaid <hi>Pedilow,</hi> the
ſaid Mr. <hi>Graves</hi> informs, that he had a full knowledge of him, and knew him to be
a very debauch'd Perſon, and ready to any wicked Deſign; and moreover, for a
clearer conviction of the guilt of the foreſaid <hi>Hubert, Lowman</hi> the Keeper of the
<hi>White Lyon</hi> was commanded to ſet him upon an Horſe, and go with him, to ſee if
he could find out the place where he threw the Fire-ball; upon which <hi>Hubert,</hi>
with more readineſs than thoſe who were well acquainted with the place, went to
<hi>Pudding-lane,</hi> where the very Houſe which was firſt fired ſtood, ſaying, <hi>Here ſtood
the Houſe;</hi> the Jaylor did endeavour do draw him off from that Belief, and put him
upon ſeeking for ſome other place, but he poſitively perſiſted in what he firſt ſaid,
and affirmed that to have been the ſaid houſe. It being intimated to the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,
that notwithſtanding the Confeſſion of the ſaid <hi>Hubert,</hi> it was confidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that the Fire in the fore-mentioned <hi>Farmer</hi> his houſe began by accident,
ſo the Commiſſioners ſent for the ſaid <hi>Farmer</hi> before them, who being examined,
ſaid, <hi>That it was impoſſible that any Fire ſhould happen in his Houſe by Accident, for
that, after twelve of the clock at Night, he had gone through every Room thereof, and
found no fire but in one Chimney, where the Roome was paved with Brick, which fire he
raked up in the Embers:</hi> He was then asked, Whether no Window or Door might
let in Wind to diſplace thoſe Coals? He affirmed, <hi>That it could not be conceived
that</hi> Wind <hi>ſhould there diſturb them, but rather that it was abſolutely ſet on fire on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dawes Williamſon</hi> Eſquire, one of his Majeſties Juſtices of the Peace, informs,
That he ſaw a man apprehended near the Temple, with his pocket ſtuffed with
combuſtible matter, made of Flax and Tow, and ſuch like ſtuff.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>John Parker</hi> informs, That he ſaw a Perſon throw ſome Combuſtible matter
into a ſhop in the <hi>Old Bayley,</hi> which he thinks was the ſhop of an Apothecary;
that immediately thereupon he ſaw a great ſmoak, and ſmel't, as it were, the ſmell
of Brimſtone; that the perſon that did this immediately ran away, but upon the
outcry of the People he was taken by the Guard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Randal Harſland</hi> and <hi>Humphry Bowyer,</hi> they both agree, that they ſaw a Perſon
fling ſomething into a Houſe near St. <hi>Antholins</hi> Church, and that thereupon the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64490:4"/>
Houſe was on fire, and the ſmoak thereof filled the Houſe on the other ſide of the
way; and when this was done, there was no fire near by a quarter of a mile.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Michael March,</hi> an Officer of the Trained-Bands, in a Company of Sir <hi>Richard
Brown's,</hi> apprehended a woman in the time of the Fire, at the <hi>Nags-head</hi> in
<hi>Leaden-hall-ſtreet,</hi> with an Inſtrument like a dark Lanthorn, made, as is conceived,
to lay a Train of Powder, and it was filled with Gunpowder, (there were two more
in her Company) they being asked for what Uſe they imployed the ſaid Inſtrument,

               <p>
                  <hi>Nawſon Killingworth</hi> Eſquire, informs, that he apprehended a Perſon during the
Fire, about whom he found much combuſtible matter, and certain black things of
a large Figure, which he could not endure to hold in his hand by reaſon of their
extream Heat; this Perſon was ſo ſurpriſed at firſt, that he could not anſwer to any
queſtion, but being on his way to <hi>White Hall,</hi> he acted the part of a Madman, ſo
continuing while he was preſent with him.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>John Maynard,</hi> a Member of this Houſe, informs, he had ſome of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible
matter in his hand, and though it was in its Natural conſiſtency unfired,
yet the Heat was ſcarce to be endured by the touch.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Freeman</hi> of <hi>Southwark</hi> Brewer, whoſe Houſe there was lately burned, informs,
that the ſame day his Houſe was fired, about a quarter of an hour before three, was
found a paper with a Ball of Wild-fire, containing near a pound wrap'd up in it,
in the nave of a wheel, in an outer houſe, where lay a great quantity of Timber;
how this houſe was fired he knoweth not; but this he affirms to the Committee,
it could not be by accident, becauſe there had not been any Candle or Fire in the
Houſe where the Hay lay, that whole day; and the Hay being laid up before Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer
very dry, it could not poſſibly be ſet on fire within it ſelf; and moreover,
he ſaid, the Hay-loft was on fire on the top of the Houſe, and that the Fire ſpread
from one end of the Roof to the other in an inſtant.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Richard Harwood</hi> ſaith, That he being near the Feathers Tavern by St. <hi>Pauls,</hi>
on the fourth of <hi>September,</hi> ſomething like Wild-fire by the ſparkling and ſpitting
of it, appeared, whereof he gave notice to ſome Souldiers there, who cauſed it to
be quenched.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Robert Bird,</hi> whoſe Houſe it was that was ſet on Fire, informed, That
his Wife retained one <hi>Elizabeth Oxley</hi> to be her Servant (ſuppoſing her
to be a Proteſtant) upon <hi>Monday</hi> the 24th of <hi>February</hi> laſt, but ſhe came
not to her Service until the 6th of <hi>March</hi> after. That upon Wedneſday night the
9th of <hi>April</hi> laſt, about two or three of the clock in the morning, the ſaid Servant
came to his Bed-ſide and awaked him, telling him <hi>There was a Fire in Holborn:</hi>
Whereupon he asked her, How ſhe knew it? She anſwered, By the noiſe in the
Street. Whereupon he aroſe, and look'd into the Street, but there was little noiſe
or light; ſo he ſtaid at his Street-door, until he was informed by two men that
paſſed by, that there had been a Fire, but it was put out again: whereupon he
returned to Bed, well pleaſed he had ſo watchful a Servant, and fearful of Fire:
But none of his Family heard any thing thereof, until informed by the ſaid <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi>
as he believeth. That on Thurſday the 10th. of <hi>April,</hi> he was told,
the ſaid <hi>Oxley</hi> went not up to Bed till about eleven a Clock: That before he
went to Bed, he looked to the Doors, Windows, and Rooms, to ſee if all were
ſafe from Fire and Thieves, (as his cuſtom was) and was the laſt up in the
Family, as he thought. That being in Bed and aſleep, about twelve of the clock
that night he was awaked with a great beating at the door by the Watch,
and the ſaid <hi>Oxley</hi> coming immediately to him, told him, <hi>There was a Fire:</hi>
To which he ſaid, He was ſure it was not in his Houſe, but gave her the Key of
the Street-door; who ran down, and let in the Watch and Company; and he
coming down, found a large Preſs in his Cloſet, (for keeping Books, Papers,
and Writings, on a light Fire, but by the mercy of God, and the great help he
had, the Fire was put out, and his Houſe preſerv'd. That his Wife with ſome
Neighbours immediately going to the ſaid <hi>Oxley's</hi> Lodging Room to ſee if all
was ſafe, found that ſhe had packed up her Clothes and things ready to carry
away, and her Trunks lock'd up, but nothing left in them of value: Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he demanded of the ſaid <hi>Oxley</hi> why ſhe had packed up her Clothes? She
anſwered, that ſhe and his other Maid <hi>Martha</hi> had packed up her things to
ſave them. Then he asked the ſaid <hi>Martha,</hi> Why ſhe had packed up in that
time, when the Lives of the Children and Family were in that danger? who
poſitively denied that ſhe packed up any thing; Whereupon, and for that he
was ſure when he went to bed there was not a ſpark of Fire in the Cloſet, and
conſidering that the ſaid <hi>Oxley</hi> at the firſt knocking at the door, though ſhe lay
two pair of ſtairs above his Chamber; and being informed that ſhe had not put
out her Candle into the Candleſtick, nor burnt it, but pulled it out, and hid the
Candleſtick; and from the manner of her Carriage uſed when ſhe perceived ſhe
was ſuſpected; he poſitively Charged the ſaid <hi>Oxley</hi> with Firing his Houſe, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64490:10"/>
cauſed her to be kept ſafe all that night: And the next day being Charged by
the Neighbours with Firing the Houſe, ſhe at laſt Confeſſed the ſame, by
ſetting the Preſs in the Cloſet and his Papers on Fire about Twelve of the Clock,
when he and his Family were aſleep. And he ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſhe the ſaid <hi>Oxley</hi> might
have gone out at a Back door of his Houſe, and carried away any of his Goods
and Plate, if ſhe pleaſed at any hour in the night, without Firing his Houſe;
the Key of the Back door lying in the Kitchin, and laid there by her ſelf. And

that were in <hi>England;</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould be King over <hi>England;</hi> that
all that would turn to the Popiſh Religion ſhould live far better than now they did;
that all the Land were Hereticks, and it were a Meritorious Act to deſtroy them;
and that all ſuch as were Papiſts ſhould have Marks upon their Hats, whereby to
diſtinguiſh them from Proteſtants, that they might not be deſtroyed amongſt them.
Adding, that the Nation do believe that all things will be over before the 28th
day of <hi>June,</hi> but they would be deceived, for all ſhould be deſtroyed at or before
that time. That the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was the braveſt Prince living, and that he was
gone out of the Kingdom, leſt the Hereticks ſhould cut off his Head, and he would
not return till they were deſtroyed; that the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> would not one
of them Suffer, for they would come off well enough, being to be tryed by the
Lords; and that the Scaffolds were ſet up but for faſhion-ſake. That ſhe telling
the ſaid <hi>Stubbs</hi> that ſhe was Hired to Live with one Mr. <hi>Bird</hi> about the middle of
<hi>Fetter-lane,</hi> he uſed perſwaſions to her at ſeveral times to ſet Fire on her Maſters
Houſe; telling her, if ſhe would do it, he would give her five pound, and gave her
half a Crown, and ſaid, he would have other Houſes in <hi>Holborn</hi> Fired at the ſame
time by others: That ſhe being with the ſaid <hi>Stubbs</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi> before the ſaid
Fire, promiſed to Fire her Maſter's Houſe on <hi>Thurſday</hi> or <hi>Friday</hi> night following;
and accordingly on <hi>Thurſday</hi> night ſhe took a Candle and ſet Fire to her Maſter's
Papers in his Study, which were in a kind of a Preſs; and then being on a light
Fire, ſhe ſhut the doors, and went up ſtairs into her own Chamber in the top of
the Houſe, and packed up her own Things, and Undreſſed her ſelf, leſt her Maſter
ſhould ſuſpect her, and there ſtayed till a great Knocking was at the Door, and
the Watchmen crying out Fire; whereupon ſhe run down Stairs, and cryed out
Fire, and her Maſter gave her the Keys to open the Door; which done, all hands
were employed to quench the Fire. And ſhe ſaith, ſhe did not ſet-Fire on her
Maſters Houſe out of any Malice to him, nor with intent to Rob him, but

meerly to carry on the Deſign which <hi>Stubbs</hi> had propoſed to her, and out of
hopes of his Reward.</p>
