            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Or the inestimable riches of the British Seas, which do yeild a monthly Harvest of several Fish in their season, which being brought into the Land, would make Flesh at a low rate, encrease Shipping, Mariners, Trade, and publique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, whereof this Book doth give a plentiful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the which we may in some measure thus accomplish:</p>
            <p>Let every Ward in <hi>London</hi> build a Buss, and Money to do it may be thus raised.</p>
            <p>If every Ward would pay a three moneths Assessment which they pay to the L. Generals Army, at the rate of 90000. l. <hi>per mensem,</hi> ready down, or if the poorer sort think it too much for them, if the richer will raise it, they may have the benefit of their Stock returned every half yeer, and one Merchant may be found in a Ward which may be the husband of that Buss for that yeer, and those 25. Merchants may be a Committee for the 25. Ships, for all Intents and purposes.</p>
            <p>Which Ship would imploy all the Poor in their Ward, for to beat Hemp, to spin it, to make Twine, and Nets, and Cordage for the setting of Her forth, and may be called by the Name of the Ward.</p>

            <p>THe Coasts of Great Brittain do yeild such a continual Sea-harvest of grain to all those that with diligence do labour in the same, that no time or season in the year passeth away without some apparent means of profitable employments, especially to such as apply themselves to Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which from the beginning of the yeer unto the latter end, continueth upon some one Port or other upon our Coasts, and therein such infinite shoals and multitudes of Fishes are offered to the takers, as may justly move admiration (not only to strangers, but) to those that are daily employed amongst them.</p>
            <p>The Summer Fishing for Herrings begins about <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summer,</hi> and lasteth some part of <hi>August</hi>; The Winter Fishing for Herrings lasteth from <hi>September</hi> to the midst of <hi>November,</hi> both which extend from <hi>Boughoness</hi> in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to the <hi>Thames</hi> mouth.</p>

               <p>BY reason of those multitude of Ships and Mariners, they have extended their Trade to all parts of the World, (exporting for the most part) in all their voyages of <hi>Herring</hi> and other Fish, for the maintenance of the same; in exchange whereof they return the several Commodities of other Countries.</p>
               <p>From the Southern parts, as <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> for our <hi>Herrings,</hi> they return, <hi>Oyls, Wines, Prunes, Hony, Wools, Grain,</hi> with store of <hi>Coyns</hi>; From the <hi>Straights, Velvets, Sa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>From the <hi>East Country,</hi> for our <hi>Herrings</hi> and other <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Commodities before returned, they bring home <hi>

               <p>From <hi>Brabant</hi> they return for the most part ready Coyn, with some <hi>Tapestries, Says,</hi> and <hi>Hull-shops</hi>; yea, some of our Herrings are carried as far as <hi>Brasile,</hi> and that which is more strange, and greatly to our shame, that four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Ships, which fish with our men at <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> within ken almost of Land, do vent our <hi>Herrings</hi> amongst us here in <hi>England,</hi> and make us pay for the Fish taken upon our Coasts ready money, wherewith they store their owne Country.</p>

               <p>By their large extent of Trade, they are become as it were Citizens of the whole World, whereby they have so enlarged their Towns, that most of them within these four hundred yeers, are full as great again as they were before; <hi>Amsterdam, Leyden,</hi> and <hi>Middleburgh</hi> having been lately twice enlarged, and their streets and buildings <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>SUch being then the number of their Ships and Mariners, and so great their Trade, occasioned principally by their Fishing, they have not only strengthned and fortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at home, to repel all forreign Invasions, as lately in the War between them and <hi>Spain,</hi> but have likewise stretched their Power into the East and West <hi>Indies</hi>; in many places whereof they are Lords of the Sea-coasts, and have likewise fortified upon the Main, where the King and people are at their devotion; and more then this<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>MOreover how mightily the publique Revenue and Customs of that State are encreased by their Fishing may appear, in that about thirty yeers since, over and above the Customs of the merchandise, Excises, Licenses, Waftage, and Lastage, there was paid to the State for Custom of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and other salt Fish, above thirty thousand pounds in one yeer, besides the tenth Fish, and cask paid for waftage, which cometh at least to as much more, among the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers only, whereunto the tenth of other Commodities being added, it amounteth to a far greater sum; we are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to know that a great part of their Fish is sold in other Countries for ready money, for which they commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the finest gold and Silver, and coming home recoyn it of a baser Allay under their own stamp, which is no small means to augment their publique Treasure.</p>

               <head>Seventhly, <hi>Encrease of private Wealth.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS touching their private Wealth, if we consider the abundant store of Herrings and other Fish by them ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the usual <unclear>prices</unclear> that they are sold for, as also the multitude of Trades-men and Artificers that by reason of this their fishing are daily set on work, we must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the gain thereof made by private men, must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity be exceeding great, as by observing the particulars following, it will plainly appear.</p>
               <p>During the wars between the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> before the last Truce, the <hi>Dunkirks</hi> by taking, spoiling, and burning the Busses of <hi>Holland,</hi> and setting great ransom upon the Fishermen, enforced them to compound for great sums of money, that they might fish quietly one yeer; whereunto the next yeer after, the Fishermen among themselves were to pay a Doller upon every last of Herrings towards the maintenance of certain Ships of War, to <unclear>waft</unclear> and secure them in their Fishing; by reason whereof, there was a Record kept of the several lasts of Herrings taken that yeer, and it appeareth thereby that in one half yeer there were taken three hundred thousand lasts of Herrings, which at twelve pound <hi>per</hi> last, amounteth to three millions and six hundred thousand pounds; and at sixteen twenty, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pounds a last they are ordinarily sold, being transported into other Countries, it cometh at least to five millions of pounds.</p>
               <p>Whereunto if we add the Herrings taken by other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, together with the <hi>Cod, Ling, Hake,</hi> and other fish taken by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and other Neighbours upon the Brittish Coasts all the yeer long, the total will evidently arise to above ten millions of pounds.</p>
               <p>This great Trade of Fishing employing so many men and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115036:6"/>
Ships at sea, must necessarily maintain as great a number of Trades-men and Artizans on land; as Spinsters and Hemp-winders, for Cables, Cordage, Yarn, Twine for Nets and Lines, Weavers to make Sail-clothes, Receivers, Packers, Tacklers, Dressers, and Couchers, to sort and make the Herrings lawful Merchandise, Tanners to tan their sails and nets, Coopers to make casks, Blocks and Bowl makers, for Ships, Keelmen, and Labourers, for carrying and removing of fish, Sawyers for plancks, Carpenters, Ship-wrights, Smiths, Car-men, Boatmen, Brewers, Bakers, and a number of others, whereof a number are maim'd persons, and unfit to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise employed, besides the maintenance of all their several wives, children, and families; and further, every man or maid-servant, or orphan, having any poor stock  may venture the same in their fishing voyages, which affords them ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily great increase, and is duly paid according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of their gain.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Eightly, <hi>Encrease of Provision.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ANd to conclude, it is manifest, that <hi>Holland</hi> only afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it self some few <hi>Hops, Madder, Butter,</hi> and <hi>Chees,</hi> aboundeth notwithstanding by reason of this Art of fishing, in plentiful manner with all kind of provisions (as well for life) as in Corn, Beef, Mutton, Hides, and <hi>Cloth</hi> (as for luxury) in Wines, Silks, and Spices (and for defence) as Pitch, Tar, Cordage, Timber; All which they have, not only in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent proportion for their own use, but are likewise able, from their several Magazines, to supply to Neighbor Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. The premisses considered, it maketh much to the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy and shame of our English Nation that God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture offering us so rich a Treasure even to our own dores, we do notwithstanding neglect the benefit thereof, and by paying money to strangers for the fish of our own Seas, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverishing our selves to make them rich; insomuch that for want of Industry and care in this particular, two hundred
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115036:7"/>
and twenty five Fisher Towns are decayed, and reduced to extreme poverty; whereas on the contrary, by diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to make use of so great a blessing, we might in short time repair those decayed Towns of the Common-wealth, and add both Honour, and Strength, and Riches to this Nation; which how easily it may be done, will in some measure appear by some observations following.</p>
               <p>By erecting two hundred and fifty Busses of reasonable strength and Bigness, there will be employment made for a thousand Ships, and for at least twenty thousand Fishermen and Mariners at Sea, and consequently for as many Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Labourers at Land; The Herrings taken by those Busses, will afford the State twenty thousand pounds yeerly Custom outward, and for Commodities returned inward, three hundred thousand pounds, and above.</p>
               <p>We have Timber sufficient, and at reasonable Rates, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our Land for the building of Busses. Every shire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth men of hardy and able bodies fit for such imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who now live poorly and idely at home.</p>

                  </gap>ing, and Packing our Fishing, and for succour in stress of weather; We may bring our fish to land, Salt, and Pack it, And from parts of this States Dominions, be at our Markets in <hi>France, Spain,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> before the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> can arive in <hi>Holland.</hi> We have means to transport our fish into some Southern Countries, where the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> seldom or never come; and though we had as many Busses as the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> yet is there want for all, and more; for in the East and Northern Countries, and in many other places, Herrings are every days meat, Winter and Summer, as wel to draw on drink, as to satisfie hunger; And in most places the greatest part of the year they are scarce to be had; for presently after Michaelmas, the Sound &amp; Rivers are fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen up, so that no Herrings can be Transported into several
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115036:7"/>
Kingdoms, Dukedomes and free Estates, until July which is for 30 weekes space together, so that when Lent comes, there are few to be bought for money.</p>
               <p>Lastly, since by care and industry gain'd from the Fleming, doubtles by the means we may grow as expert in the Art of fishing, and in time make it a Staple Comodity of our own.</p>
               <p>But this we shall the better and sooner do, if we consider and endeavour to reform certaine wants and abuses, which heretofore hath hindred us from effecting this good and great work, whereof these that follow are none of the least.</p>
               <p>General liberty of eating of flesh contrary to the old cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, and the Statute Laws provided for observing fish days, from whence scarcity and dearth of flesh proceedeth; for where flesh is ordinarily spent, fish will not be bought, and want of sale decayeth all Trade; Gain being the Nurse of Industry: Want of Order and Direction in our Fishing, every man being left to himself, and permitted to fish as best liketh him: whereas among the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> two of the best experienc'd fishermen are appointed to guide the rest of the Fleet, and the others are bound to follow them, and to cast their lines according to their discretion. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> and other Nations set forth with their <hi>Busses</hi> in <hi>Iune,</hi> to find the shoal of fish, and having found it, dwell amongst it till <hi>November</hi>; whereas we stay till the Herrings come home to the Road-steds, and somtimes suffer them to pass by, ere we look out, our Herring fishing continuing only seven weeks at the most, and theirs twenty.</p>
               <p>The Hollanders Busses are great and strong, and able to brook foul weather, whereas our Cobbles, Crayers, and Boats being small and thin-sided, are easily swallowed by a rough sea, not daring to adventure far in fair weather, by reason of their weakness, for fear of storms.</p>
               <p>The Hollanders are industrious, and no sooner are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of their lading, but presently put forth for more, and seek for markets abroad as well as at home; whereas our English after they have been once at Sea, do commonly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115036:8"/>
return again, until all the money taken for their fish be spent, and they in debt, seeking only to serve the next Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket.</p>
               <p>The Hollanders do retain the Merchants, who during the Herring season, do duly come to the places where the Bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses arrive, and joyning together in several Companies, do presently agree for the lading of thirty or forty Busses at once, and so being discharged, they may speedily return to their former fishing: Whereas our Fishermen are uncertain of their Chap-men, and forced to spend much time in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off their Fish by parcels.</p>
               <p>These, and other defects would carefully be taken into consideration, and certain Orders made to make our Fishing prosperous and successful, especially considering the mischiefs the neglect hereof hath brought to the Nation in general, and to many good Towns and Corporations in particular, as by Authority even of Parliament it self in the Statute of 33. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. is plainly testified; which I have briefly set down, to avoid the prolixity of the Original. Because the English Fishermen dwelling on the Sea-Coast, do leave off their Trade of Fishing in our Seas, and went but the half Seas over,, and thereupon the English did buy fish of <hi>Pickards, Flemmings, Normans,</hi> and <hi>Zelanders</hi>; by reason whereof, many incomodities did grow unto the Realm (<hi>Viz</hi>) The Decay of the Wealth and Prosperity as wel of the Cinque Ports and members of the same, as of other Coast Towns by the Sea side, which were built and inhabited by a great Multitude of people by reason of our using and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising the Craft and feat of fishing. Secondly, The Decay of a great Number of Boats and ships. And Thirdly, of many good Mariners, both able men in body by their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent labours and Continual exercise of fishing, and expert by reason thereof in the knowledge of the Sea Coasts, aswel within this land as in other parts beyond the Seas; It was therefore enacted, that no maner of persons, <hi>English Denizon,</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:115036:8"/>
or <hi>Strangers,</hi> at that time, or at any time after, dwelling in <hi>England,</hi> should buy any <hi>Fresh Fish</hi> of any Strangers in the said Ports of <hi>Flaunders, Zeland, Picardie, France,</hi> as upon the Sea between shore and shore, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This Act by mean Continuances, was continued from Parliament: to Parliament. until the first of <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> and from thence to the end of the next Parliament, and then expired.</p>
               <p>For Conclusion, saving by that which hath formerly been declared; it evidently appeareth, that the States of the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> by immemorable perscription, continual usage, and possession the acknowledgement of all Neighbours, States, and the Municipal Laws of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have ever held the soveraigne Lordship of the Seas, of <hi>England</hi>; and that unto them (by reason their soveraignty) the supreme Command and Jurisdiction over the Passage and fishing in the same rightfully appertaineth; considering also the natural Scire of these our Seas, that interpose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves betwen the great Northern Commerce of the North part of the world, &amp; of that of the East, West, and Southern Climats; and withal, the infinite commodities that the fishing in the same is daily made, It cannot be doubted, but that the States by means of their Wisdom and Vertue, and by the Justice, and faithfulness and obedient disposition of the Natives and people of this our Common-wealth, may easily (without injustice to any State or person whatsoever) be made the greatest State for Command and Wealth, and the people thereof, be the most oppulent and flourishing Nation of any other in the world; And this the rather, for that this State is now almost absolute Commander of all the Brittish Isles, and hath also enlarged their Dominions over a great part of the Western Indies; by means of which extent of Empire, crossing in a manner the whole Ocean, the trade &amp; persons of all Nations moving from one part of the world to the other, must of necessity come within the Compass of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115036:9"/>
their Power and Jurisdiction; And therefore the Soveraignty of our Seas being the most Precious Iewel of the State, and next under God the principall means of our Wealth and Safety, All true English hearts and hands are bound by all possible means and diligence to perserve and maintain the same, even with the utmost hazard of their lives, their goods, and fortunes.</p>
               <p>By all that which hath bin said, it doth appear how great a Nation <hi>England</hi> is, by reason of the inestimable Riches and Commodities which (besides our selves) other Nations our Neighbours do yeerly reap, especially by Fishing in our Seas; insomuch that no Christian Prince in the World is Lord of any Territory that (considering all circumstances) yeildeth the like constant and general benefit.</p>
