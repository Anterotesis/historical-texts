            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Carce had the Sun broken
and dissipated the darknesse
of the preceding stormy
and blustering night, when
<hi>Sigr. Georgio Spinola</hi> (Son
to the Ancient Senator,
<hi>Francisco Spinola,</hi> of whose
vertues and greatnesse few can be ignorant,
who have either heard of <hi>Flanders</hi> or <hi>Ostend)</hi>
according to his wonted custom, taking the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49502:10"/>
opportunity of the pleasant coolnesse of the
morning, a happinesse and blessing in those hot
and scortching Countries, was walked along
the Sea-Coast some pretty distance of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Palace which stood upon the <hi>Riviera,</hi>
and not much more then six miles from <hi>Genoua,</hi>
a City whose famous and magnificent structures
makes her exalt her head above the proudest in
<hi>Italy,</hi> wherein diversity of cogitations viewd &amp;
admiring where the Rouling Seas which distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by the last nights winds were not yet paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
he might as the waves advanced them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
espie somthing tumbling and tossing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the shore, and by the reflection of the
morning beams see somwhat glisten, which yet
at first by reason of the great distance of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
he rather thought a fancy of his deluded
imagination then any reallity, but at length
the force of the waves driving it neerer, he
might easily perceive that it was a man, with a
naked Sword in his hand, whom the cruelty of
the Seas had deprived of all hopes or shelter,
but only what the Mast he bestred could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
him; no sooner was generous <hi>Spinola</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with the certainty of what he first
doubted, but his magnanimous soul pittying
the distresse of him he knew not, he with the
wings of compassion flies towards <hi>Lizari</hi> (for
there stood the Palace of his renowned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors)
and with all possible speed manning
out a <hi>Felucca</hi> ventures himselfe in person in
that rough and boystrous Sea to save the miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
stranger to whom otherwise no hope of life
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49502:10"/>
could be left, whilst either want of strength
longer to sustain himselfe upon his rouling
Barque, must render him a prey to the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Seas, or a more cruell death certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
him, if by the violence of the waves he
should be thrown head-long among the sharp
and obdurate Rocks. But the quick speed of
of the worthy <hi>Spinola</hi> prevented his ruine, for
though having arrived him, he found him ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
spent with endeavouring to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
firme upon his skittish, though inanimate
Cowrses, insomuch that his Sword which he
at first brandished above his head with an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible
gallantry, growing too weighty for his
weak and tired Arm, hung down in the Sea, as
as if it would be revenged on that which
would prove the devourer of its Master, yet
he came time enough to see some hopes that
his almost departed spirits might again by some
cherishing be revived, and therefore taking
him into his <hi>Fellucca,</hi> and there disposing his
speechlesse Corps with the greatest ease so
small a Boat would afford, he now made as
much hast to shore as he had before done to Sea,
fearing least his goodnesse should want the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
effect, and the Gentleman (for so he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him to be both by his aire and habit) for
want of those Cordials which the shore might
supply him with, yeild up his tired spirit; but
the stranger whose speechlesnesse proceeded
meerly from the benumedness of his senses (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
now been three dayes in the water) was
soon by the warmth of those cloaths where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49502:11"/>
the compassionate <hi>Spinola</hi> had caused him
to be covered, revived, when looking about
and finding himselfe still at Sea, but not so
solitary as before, he amazedly demanded
where he was, and how he came there; to
which the courteous <hi>Spinola</hi> told him in what
manner he had espied him floating upon the
Main, withall freely profering what ever civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
lay in his reach either by his power in the
Country, or otherwise assuring him he should
be honoured if he would please to command
him; in the mean time desiring that till he
should regain that strength which he must of
necessity have lost by being driven up and down
the Ocean, he would accept of what entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
his Fathers Palace would afford; for
(continued the generous <hi>Spinola)</hi> though I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well know both by your countenance and
habit that you are an <hi>English Man,</hi> and am not
ignorant of the great stops that those of your
Nation have by their valour and magnanimity
put to the progresse of my Fathers glory and
fortunes in the <hi>Nether-lands,</hi> besides that the
intimate friendship between us and his most
Potent Catholick Majesty against whom your
Virgin Queen hath to the wonder of the
World so long and so prosperously maintained
a War, should incite us to a disaffection of you,
yet you shall find I hope that generosity in our
spirits, as shall perswade you that neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
affection, nor interest, can sway us to the
least forfeiture of those rules of charity
which injoyn us to succor and relieve the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49502:11"/>
especially when we find such persons
cast into the depth of miseries who least of all
deserved any, in which number said he (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a congue) I doubt not but you may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled;
The <hi>English</hi> stranger was very much
perplexed what answer to returne so much ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
which made him for some time silent, till
at length making a due acknowledgment of the
vastnesse of his obligations, protesting that as
by the saving of his life it was indebted to
him, so it should be for ever at his command
and service; withall hoping that fortune would
in time be so favourable to him as to put him
into a capacity by some personal service to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the gratitude of his soul, which by
words he should never be able to do;
scarce had he finished to speak when the <hi>Fellucca</hi>
came to land, where too servants stood ready
with a Sedan to conduct the <hi>English</hi> stranger to
<hi>Spinola</hi>'s Palace; whither come, he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
carried into one of the most sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Chambers of it; and sumptuous Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
there were both for building and furui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as any Court in <hi>Europe</hi> could boast of;
the square of the Palace it selfe being supported
by one hundred and fifty Pillars of pure <hi>Carara</hi>
Marble, the Court Yard adorned with four
most stately Fountains or Waterworks, and
the Palace every where imbellished by
the great number of curious and ancient
Statues.</p>
                        <p>But neither the statelinesse of the place, the
great care which was taken of him whereby he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49502:12"/>
in short time recovered perfect health, nor
the daily conversation of <hi>Spinola,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
delighted in his company, could at all
divert the <hi>English</hi> Stranger from his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
thoughts, which appeared more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparent
every day then other to great wonder
of the worthy <hi>Spinola,</hi> who endeavoured by
all means possible to banish from him his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
pensivenesse by inventing new sports
and pastimes to recreate both his body and
mind, but all his endeavours proved in vain;
for the more he strove to make him merry, the
sadder still grew, insomuch that had not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
obliged him, he would have shun'd
the company of his preserver, as his did that
of all others.</p>
                        <p>Often had the good and generous <hi>Spinola</hi>
desired his unknown Guest to impart unto
him the cause of this his melancholly, but was
ever put off with excuses and desires that he
would not put him to the remembrance of so
dismal a story, till at length they two being
according to the custom walking in a private
Garden, <hi>Spinola</hi> more earnestly then ever
pressed him to reveal that which could possesse
him with so great a trouble and dejection of
spirit, protesting that as he had been instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
once in the saving of his life, so he
would devote his life or what ever might be

solitary disease, for whilst that continued he
still seemed dead to him, promising that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital
he would relate to him the story of his

free from misfortunes, though perhaps they
were such as were not fit to be weighed in the

                        <p>The stranger endeavoured by all means pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to excuse the relation of his miseries, but
being again and again importuned by him to
whom he owed his life as his preserver, he
could no longer deny to satisfie the desires of
his generous friend, and therefore retiring
into a pleasant Arbour which stood at the end
of the Walks, he thus began.</p>

                           <p>MOst Noble Friend and generous Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
when you shall have heard
through how many various changes and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of fortune I have run, you will think, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
my age, that every minute of my time
(my childhood only excepted) had been a new
&amp; distinct misfortune: My birth you already
know to have been in the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi>
a Kingdom sufficiently famous throughout all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49502:13"/>
the World, both for its outward force and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
plenty, which as you say, has miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
for so many years maintained a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the most Potent Catholique King, and
still in all attempts made upon that mighty
Monarch gained the upper hand; but because
this Kingdom is besides the annexion of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Wales</hi> in her selfe divided into severall
Shires or Counties, many of which have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been particular Kingdoms; 'twill be
convenient to give you an account of the exact
place of my Nativity. Know then noble Sir,
that I was borne nigh unto the famous City of
<hi>Sarum</hi> in the County of <hi>Sommerset,</hi> in which
Shire my Father enjoyed a yearly Revenue of
neer fifteen hundred pounds <hi>per annum;</hi> his
name was <hi>Goodlake,</hi> my Mothers <hi>Seymour,</hi>
which of the two I must needs confesse is the
more noble and ancient name; my Father had
besides my selfe three Sons and two Daughters,
of all which I was the youngest, and so like to
enjoy the least part of my Fathers wealth,
though during his life he was not at all sparing
in giving me as liberal education as my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
of whom he took so great care that he
thought it not sufficient to have them endowed
with learning except they were likewise adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with all qualities necessary to make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and compleat Gentleman, such he
thought Fencing, riding the great Horse, and
other active Exercises which might make them
fit upon occasion to serve their Country; nor
was he sparing in his cost to learn them Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49502:13"/>
singing, and other lesse usefull exercises, as
things fitting to distinguish them from the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
                           <p>My Father died about that time that I arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to seventeen years of age, leaving me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
those Gentleman-like qualities that might
make me fit to gain a livelyhood and honour in
forreign Countries, but a small parcell of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
yet such as with moderation I might have
lived upon, but it was hard for me who had
been highly bred during my fathers life to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
my self now to a pension, and so small a
one too as threescore Marks a year was, so that
before two years were expired I was indebted
twice as much as my annuity came to, which
made me begin to perceive that whilst I took
those courses I headlong pursued my ruine, my
debts begun to be dayly called for, which if I
paid I must leave my selfe uncapable to subsist,
and if not run the hazzard of being imprisoned.
Feare of this last made me finding delayes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the danger, on a suddain to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
with my elder Brother, and to sell him my
annuity, whereby I not only paid my debts but
had a considerable sum of money in my purse
with which I was resolved to prove my utmost
fortunes.</p>
                           <p>And hoping that I might have the same good
hap which oftentimes befals younger Brothers
who have nothing but their gentility to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them, that is by gaining the favours of yong
Ladies whose plentifull portions might better
be given to supply the wants of such persons,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49502:14"/>
whom the ill Laws, or rather the ill customes of
<hi>England</hi> had made poor, then added to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fortunes of those who already abounded
with superfluity of worldly riches. I put on a
resolution to cast in my lot among others, and
cloathing my self in a garb much above my slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
fortunes, by degrees I got into the acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of many Ladies, among whom I resolved
to choose one, both of whose Person and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I could approve, and in short time pitched
upon the beauteous <hi>Mariana,</hi> Joynt heiress with
her Sister of the great estate of Sir <hi>Robert Molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaux,</hi>
a Family famous in the Western parts of
<hi>England:</hi> I confesse at first the greatnesse of her
beauty, parts, and riches did somewhat daunt
me, who knew my self so far beneath her in all.
At those words the worthy <hi>Spinola</hi> interrupted
him by saying noble friend, though by what
your self report, I dare believe your estate
much inferiour to that of your beauteous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse,
yet I must needs say that I find this by
that small experience I have had of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
that no Woman could be possessor of
so much virtue, whereof you deserved not to
be Patron, and I seriously protest that were I
to be Judge, I durst affirm that for parts and
Person, you merit the greatest Princess in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome.
The Captain returned him a civill
thanks for his so good an opinion of him, but
withall told him that what he spoke were but
<hi>Hyperbolies,</hi> and far above his merit, but to
continue my sad story, (said he, (which I only
relate as an introduction to a sadder) I being
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49502:14"/>
resolved in my former determinations, addrest
my selfe unto her in the most humble manner,
either my learning, <hi>Genius,</hi> or condition could
furnish me with, but ere I had three times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
with her, such was the goodnesse of her
nature, that I found that she who had captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me, was become my vassal, nor were my
visits more pleasing to me, then they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to her; in sum, we past a contract, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
our day of marriage, and the place
where we should the morning before meet, for
she was under the tuition of a rigid Unkle her
Guardian, who would by no meanes have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to match her with a Person of so low and
meane an estate as I was of.</p>
                           <p>Could I tell you, noble fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>end, what inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressable
passions of joy my soule was possest
with at this happy successe! I thought every
minute a year, nay an age, till the prefixed time
approached; but alas how soon were my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
blasted? from what great hope did I on
the suddain fall? both our loves and contract,
were by her treacherous Chambermaid disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to her Unkle, who yet like a subtle and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull
Fox concealed his knowledge of it, til
at the very time when I hoped to have met my
beloved Mistresse at the Woodside, nigh her
Unkles house, I and my two friends who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
me, were set upon by seven Villains,
who lay there by his appointment to destroy
me; I confesse I was then raw and unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in fights, but the consideration of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
I went about made me resolute, and I
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49502:15"/>
think it would have added to my courage, had
I known the design, as I only thought them
Thieves; In short this storm was soon distipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
for almost at the first my two generous
friends gallantly assisting me, we might behold
three of the slaves trampled under the feet of
our Horses, two others wounded, and ready
to surrender themselves to our mercy, whilst
their two remaining Companions escaped, and
took shelter in the wood, those two whom we
had taken, began with pittifull moanes to beg
our mercy, telling by whom they had been set
on, and withall relating the story of my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
Gods! into what an extasy of passion
did I fall at their relation, though their swords
could not force me from my Horse, their
piercing words effected it, for I immediatly
fell into a swound, and my poor Beast sensible
of the weight of my sorrowes, seemed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to yeild and fall with me, whilst one of my
friends guarding the two Prisoners, the other
endeavoured to bring me again to life, the other
performed, they joyntly strove to comfort me
with all the perswasive arguments that either
love or friendship could furnish them with, that
there could be no doubt of <hi>Mariana</hi>'s love and
constancy to me, and whilst that endured I had
no reason to despaire. That her Unkles violent
hatred to me would rather make firme, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
her love: That if he kept her immured
from my sight, (as twas to be supposed he
would doe) it would but set her wits at work
how to find meanes to escape him. That they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49502:15"/>
would alwayes be as ready as they now had
been to venture their lives and fortunes to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
my desires. That therefore I should
set my heart at rest, and consider with them for
our present safety, the way to which we all
concluded to be the carrying of our two Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to the next Justice, which we did, and
they without hesitating, confessing what they
had before told, were committed to Goale,
but soon after by the power of <hi>Mariana</hi>'s Unkle
released, whilst I lay yet open to his further
revenge.</p>
                           <p>In the meane time I made all possible enquiry
(but very privately) after my <hi>Mariana,</hi> seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
publickly to disown any intention I ever had
of courting her, and at length found that by the
cruelty of her Unkle she was indeed chamber'd
up, and so many spies set upon her, that it was
impossible for me either to visit or convey a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to her; yet at length by the help of a Lady,
who often used to visit her, I adventured to
send her a letter, an answer to which I three
dayes expected, but instead of that came the
following Challenge.</p>

surprized me, but I was much more amazed
when I found it subscribed by one of my dearest
friends, who had before assisted me in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
attempt to steale away the faire <hi>Mariana,</hi>
and who very well knew that I was contracted
to her, I began to muse with my selfe how this
might come about, but the Gentleman that
brought it, put me out those dumps by desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
my speedy answer, which I told him I
would find either a friend or a servant of my
own to carry, with which he returned to his
friend, and I immediately went to seek out Mr.
<hi>Spencer,</hi> the other Gentleman whose courage
had saved me from being assasinated by those
Villaines which <hi>Mariana</hi>'s Unkle had set by the
Woods side to deprive me of my life, but alas!
now I expected a second help from this my
worthy friend, (on whom indeed the chiefe
part of my story will depend) I found him sick
of a violent feaver, and he altogether unable
to help me, yet such was my passion that I could
not refrain to show him <hi>Hatton</hi>'s Challenge;
Heavens! into what extremity of frenzy did
he fall into at the reading it? he in fury leapes
out of his Bed, and protests that neither sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
nor death it selfe should hinder him from
assisting me to revenge such abominable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery;
Nor could I without the help of his
Physitian perswade him to return to his rest, and
not goe immediately with me to seek out the
perjured Villaines, (for so he stiled him) but at
length overswayed by my arguments, and by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49502:17"/>
the Physitians: That by it before the next
morning he would absolutely endanger the loss
of his life, and then I should not only be desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of his help, but likewise loose my dearest
friend, he was content to desist, but withall
telling me that she did not doubt but the just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of my quarrell would make me able of my
selfe to revenge such damned infidelity, that
though he knew <hi>Hatton</hi> to be sufficiently valiant
yet his treachery would cowardize his soul, and
therefore I should not feare to attempt him
single, that he had for many yeares been an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
friend of <hi>Hatton</hi>'s, but never knew him
guilty of any falceness till now, which he (as
well as I) had the charity to believe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
rather from the inticements of <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s
Unkle then his own spirit, hardly had he
finished to speak to me when <hi>Hatton</hi> stept into
the Chamber, but seeing me there before him,
retired with as much hast as he had entred with,
only saying as he past out, that he wondred he
had received no answer from me, which I told
him he should not much longer wait for, nor
did he, for immediately I took Pen, Ink, and
Paper, and by <hi>Spencer</hi>'s advice, writ him as
followeth.</p>

without a second, for I am unwilling

                           <p>This having sealed, I posted away to him by
Mr. <hi>Spencer</hi>'s Page, who immediately returned
with an answer, that he was content to meet
me single, and withall brought along with him
a Ribband, which we guessed to be the length
of his sword, and I found it to be the just mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of mine. That night <hi>Spencer</hi> engaged me
by all the loves between us, not to depart from
him, till the morning I went to fight, so we
passed away the most part of the night in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of <hi>Hatton</hi>'s basenesse, but concluding
that the greatnesse of his estate had moved <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana</hi>'s
Unkle to proffer her in marriage to him,
and that her beauty and riches had been the
motives to make him accept of the proffer. In
the morning about five a clock I took a solemne
leave of my deare friend, not knowing but it
might be the last, (though that misery was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to a more unfortunate hour) who having
poured forth his prayers for my good successe,
which (sayes he) I doe not doubt will attend
the justnesse of your cause, bid me adieu, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49502:18"/>
I fearing least I had overslipped some minutes of
the time, made hast to the appointed place,
where I found my adversary ready to receive
me, We both without speaking began to strip
of our Doublets, and being now ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
each other, he first broke silence, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
me that if I would resigne up to him my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in the beauteous <hi>Mariana,</hi> and set her
free from all promises and contracts, I might
live; otherwise his sword should force her from
my heart: to which I replyed, That he could
not but know that I prized the enjoyment of
my deare <hi>Mariana</hi> (for mine said I) I will in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
of you call her) far above my life, and
therefore any proposition of parting with her
rather then may dearest blood was vaine and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational,
that I might with more reason per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
him to relinquish pursuite of that to
which he had nor could pretend any right to:
To this he made no other reply, but that we
came not then thither to talk but doe, and
therewith made a desperate passe at me, but it
was my fortune to put by his point, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he could recover himselfe to give him a
mortal thrust into the right side, at which he
fell, saying no more then goe now and enjoy
the price of my blood they <hi>Mari-a-na</hi>- I must
confesse I was sorry when I saw him fall, for I
would not willingly have killed kim, hoping he
might yet have been perswaded to desist further
pursuite of his love, and have proved as true
a friend as at first he had been, but seeing that
his wound was past remedy, 'twas in vaine for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49502:19"/>
me to stay and lament him, but rather study my
own safety, having therefore wrapped his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in his Cloake, I took my Horse from the
hedge where I had tyed him, and with all speed
galloped to tell <hi>Spencer</hi> what I had done, he at
first expressed a great deale of sorrow for the so
suddaine death of one that was once his friend,
but you tell me no more (sayes he) then what I
expected, and think he deserved, so that we
have more reason to lament his folly then his
death, but however (continued he) the strict
Lawes lately made against duelling will hardly
admit of such defensory excuses, and though
he might fall justly by your sword, yet the
power of his friends will endanger your life, let
me therefore advise you to make all possible
speed out of <hi>England,</hi> and because I know not
how your slender fortunes may have furnisht
you, let me beg of you to accept this (taking
down a little Cabinet from the Beds head, and
giving it me) as token of my love, which if I
live and have the happinesse to know where you
reside, I shall be most highly obliged if you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me to supply farther, otherwise, if I dye I
shall dedicate some of my last breath to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of our friendship, I could not tell
what to answer to so noble and generous a
friend, but distilling some teares out of griefe,
that I was forced to depart from him, I let him
by those silent showres know how much I pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
his goodnesse, and that the gratitude of my
soule was greater then my tongue could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse,
having therefore kissed him again and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49502:19"/>
againe, and poured forth ten thousand Prayers
for his health, as he did for my good successe;
we sorrowfully bid farewell, and I taking Horse
rid with all speed possible to the Sea Coast,
where finding a Ship going with fresh supplyes
of provisions to the <hi>English</hi>-Souldiers in <hi>Holland</hi>
I embarqued my selfe on her, and in seven days
we came to <hi>Vlishing,</hi> whence I travel'd to the
<hi>Hague,</hi> and there changing my name to <hi>Love-ill</hi>
listed my selfe a Souldier, to recount to you
Noble <hi>Spinola</hi> any passages of this war, were
but to give you a dark and blind repetition of a
thing which your selfe already know most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly:
I confessed (said <hi>Spinola)</hi> I have from
my Father and other friends, besides some smal
experience of my own, received an exact rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those wars, nor must I now forget that
I have often heard him mention you as a Person,
who of all the <hi>English</hi> Captaines, behaved
your selfe with most courage and noblenesse;
I confesse (continued <hi>Goodlake)</hi> I was in a small
time of being there, more by the partiall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the <hi>English</hi> Generall, then any desert
of mine, commissioned Captain of a Foot
Comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>ny, and such a Company as had they
had a Captaine equall, either in Courage or
experience to the meanest of them, might have
performed wonders. But to return to my said
story, my deare <hi>Mariana</hi> sadly lamented my
losse and absence, and would her selfe, had she
not been so narrowly watched by her Uncle,
have adventured to have found me, but yet was
she not by reason of my absence so closely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49502:20"/>
from her liberty as formerly, so that
we found wayes, by meanes of my dear friend
<hi>Spencer</hi> to keep a correspondence, for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<hi>Spencer</hi> still continued his noblenesse to
me in that high degree, that he not only seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times sent me supplyes of money, but
had expended great sums, and spent his whole
stock of Interest at Court in endeavouring to
procure me a pardon from the Queen, but it
could not be blamed, nor would (such was the
power of my adversaries friends) ever have
been granted, had not my fortune, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
and courage of my Company, rather
then any personal valour of mine, allotted me
to be the first, that upon storming the <hi>Brill,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the Cittadell, I have (said <hi>Spinola</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
him) heard many gallant Persons des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
upon that action, and they have generally
concluded it an act rather of desperation then
prudence, there being little to be said in justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of it, but only that it prospered; I
speak not this, continued <hi>Spinola,</hi> of your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
assault, (for that being pursuant to
command, demonstrated you truly valiant) but
to the action in general; 'Tis very true, (said
<hi>Goodlake)</hi> it was so esteemed by many under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Souldiers, but however it might be in
it selfe, sure I am it proved fortunate to me, for
by it I got that pardon, which for so many
years before I had sued for in vaine; You may
easily imagine my deare friend, that I had after
seven or eight yeares banishment a great desire
to see again my native Country, but a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49502:20"/>
to see my beloved <hi>Mariana</hi> (who still for my
sake continued a Virgin) and my deare friend
<hi>Spencer;</hi> I therefore having with very small in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty
obtained leave of the Generall, to passe
over to <hi>England,</hi> imbarqued my selfe at <hi>Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
and <hi>Favente Neptuno</hi> arrived in two dayes
at <hi>Dover,</hi> where my earnest desire to see my
friends, made me stay no longer then I could
provide my selfe with Horses to post towards
them, which diligent care soon found, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
speed made me the next day in the
evening, to arrive at the House of my generous
and noble friend <hi>Spencer,</hi> where without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ceremonies I entred, and surprized him
in a sad and serious discourse with his Sister, and
some other Ladies, but little did I think that
that griefe which I saw, had overshadowed their
visages, did so much concern me, my deare
<hi>Spencer</hi> immediately came running towards me
and imbracing and kissing me ten thousand times
congratulated my safe arrival, at length to my
Native soile and friends, but yet me thought
that his countenance was somewhat clouded,
and not so serene and complacent as I had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
known it, besides I observed that there
were, whilst I was renewing (as it were) my
friendship with <hi>Spencer,</hi> strange whisprings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Ladies, and that their former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moanings
were turned into a dumb silence, me
thought this boaded something extraordinary
but what to think I could not tell, nor did I
at all imagine that it had so neerly concerned
me, till having saluted the Ladies, I desired
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49502:21"/>
them to make me partaker of their sorrows, by
knowing the cause of them, alas Sir, said one of
them, our sorrow (if there be any here whose
lookes or other jesture may make you deem
them sorrowful) is no other then what is caused
either by the dulnesse of the weather, or some
unknown reason which we cannot be sensible of,
Alas Madam, said I, your goodnesse must par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me, if I doe yet believe, that so great a
dejection of spirit, (as I perceive in this whole
company) must necessarily proceed from some
greater occasion then the dulnesse of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which to me seemes pleasant, unlesse
(said I) I be that unknown reason from whence
it doth proceed, and turning thereupon to Mr.
<hi>Spencer,</hi> whose visage testified more discontent
then any other; I told him, that he had not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
used to receive me with such a show of
griefe and sadnesse, and therefore desired him
to let me know the occasion, for otherwise I
should be inforced to believe that some malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Person had scandalized me to him, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
him with such things as might make him
think I had justly forfeited his former friendship
which if so, I desired to know my crime and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers,
that I might confesse and crave pardon,
or right my selfe; Hereupon with many vows
he protested there was no such thing, that I
was as high in his good opinion, and that he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
my friendship as much if not more, as
ever that his present melancholy aud dejected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
proceeded from he knew not what inward
cause which had likewise poured its influence
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49502:21"/>
upon the whole Company, This though it
little satisfied me, yet I was forced to conform
my humour to theirs, for I could not perswade
them from you, and indeed I who had the most
reason to be sad knew no cause for it, till Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
being come my deare <hi>Spencer</hi> accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me to my Chamber, I began more seriously
to examine why he who was alwayes wont to
be of a joviall temper, had now so utterly ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht
mirth from his soule, especially at my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall,
Oh my deare friend (said he fetching
withall a deep sigh) since I must tell you the
cause which I would not doe, did I not know
you a Person who could absolutely command
your passions; know that the very sight of you
encreased my sorrow, for your sake did I first
conceive it, and you are the only Person in the
World it most concernes. I was somewhat start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to heare him say so, and what is it (said I in
some passion) can make me so miserable that you
should thus have cause to grieve for me? is
<hi>Mariana</hi> turn'd inconstant? and hath she now
I am come home fraught with full hopes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
her, plighted her faith unto another? It
cannot sure be, oh no, (replyed he) she conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
constant to you even to her last; to her
last? (said I) and is she then dead? oh Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens!
what cursed stars was I born under, thus
to conspire to make me miserable for ever?
Well <hi>Mariana</hi> since after so many delayes I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

he) though <hi>Mariana</hi> was (whilst living) your

to follow her in death, where you can have no

and innocent soule is fled to Heaven, when

murder, must necessarily be hurried to a black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
region. Live, live, and live, so that since the
fates have denyed you to enjoy each other here,
you may enjoy eternal Society hereafter, I
could not tell how or what to answer him, but
throwing my selfe into the Bed, I lay there (and
<hi>Spencer</hi> by me) for he would not trust me alone
lamenting my misery, in such sort, that before
morning I had contracted a most violent burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Feaver, which I wished heartily might have
carried me to my grave, and it had answered
my hopes (notwithstanding all the care of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians)
had not the sweet converse of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

he and I contracted an indissoluble knot of

us; Just at those words, came a servant to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint

the Messenger attending him, who brought him
not only letters but an expresse command to
repaire immediatly to <hi>Genoua,</hi> having dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Messenger, and perused his letters, he
returnes into the Arbour to Captaln <hi>Goodlake,</hi>
whom he findes sitting with his eyes fixed on
the ground according to his accustomary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
posture, but raising himselfe up at his
approach, was about to continue his story when
he was stopt by <hi>Spinola</hi>'s telling him; that at the
earnest entreaty of the <hi>Mantuan</hi> Embassadors
the Duke and Senate of <hi>Genoua</hi> had granted one
thousand Horse, and two thousand Foot to the
Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> to assist him in his present wars
against his too potent enemy the Duke of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi>
whereof they had thought fit, for what
deserts of his he knew not to nominate him
General, to which charge he was ordered im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
to repaire; That though he durst not
presume to desire his Company in those Wars,
yet he would willingly to gain it, could he be
dispenced with by the Senate, surrender to him
his place of Generall, and accompany him in
what inferiour rank he should think him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of, but since the place of General was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
on him by the Senate (who used not to
entrust any strangers with the chiefe command
of their Forces) and could not therefore be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of by him, yet he desired that if his spirit
inclined him yet to the Wars, he would be

of his Horse, and next Person in command to

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49502:23"/>
                              <hi>Goodlake</hi> could not refuse it, though he
would not at first seem to accept it, but rather
desired he might attend him as a private Person
till overcome by <hi>Spinola</hi>'s importunities, he
undertook the charge, though as he told him
that being a stranger he could not but expect
the envy and hatred of many gallant Persons of
his Nation who might themselves justly aspire
to that employment, and think themselves
wronged if a stranger were therein preferred
before them; To which <hi>Spinola</hi> replyed that
he doubted not but to find such gallant beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in him, as would make him above the
envy of the proudest <hi>Genouese, Goodlake</hi> thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him for his good opinion of him, but the
businesse requiring hast, they left off farther
complements, and the Captain being furnished
with Horse and attendants by the generous <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola,</hi>
they set forward together towards <hi>Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua,</hi>
but in their way, and not halfe a mile from
the City, they might see their small Army both
Horse and Foot ready drawn up to attend the
coming of their Commander, who having first
well viewed them, and then recommended
<hi>Goodlake</hi> as a Person whom he had thought fit
to appoint their Lieutenant Generall, and they
upon his commendations received him with
great applause, he ordered them to march and
take up their quarters towards the borders of
<hi>Mantua's</hi> Country, and himselfe in two dayes
time following them overtook them at <hi>Friuli,</hi>
a little Town in that Dukes Territory, not ten
miles from which between four and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49502:23"/>
                              <hi>Savoyards</hi> (who were come to the assistance
of the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and had by treachery
taken a Castle belonging to the <hi>Flaminij</hi> a noble
Family of the <hi>Mantovess</hi>) were encamped, upon
these by the advice of <hi>Goodlake,</hi> the noble <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola</hi>
resolves to give the first assault, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
advancing from <hi>Friuli</hi> in the dark of the
night lodges his Army within a mile of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
intending about break of day to fall in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them at unawares, but they having advice
by their Scouts, had drawn out into an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
ground ready to receive them, yet that
not at all abated <hi>Spinola's</hi> courage, but having
given the charge of the right wing of Horse to
<hi>Goodlake,</hi> and of the left to <hi>Segr. Alexandro Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiniani,</hi>
himselfe commanding the body, began
the fight about break of day, which continued
doubtfull (the <hi>Savoyards</hi> being more in number
then the <hi>Genoveses</hi>) for about two houres, till
Captain <hi>Goodlake</hi> first, and after him <hi>Iustiniani</hi>
having broken both the wings of Horse, the
battell clearly showed it selfe on the <hi>Genoveses</hi>
side, for Captain <hi>Goodlake</hi> having left sufficient
numbers to pursue the enemies scattered left
wing, and make good what he had gained with
a select party of Horse, came flying to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
of the noble <hi>Spinola,</hi> who was somewhat
oppressed, for the <hi>Savoy</hi> infantry being both
more numerous and better experienced Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
then the <hi>Genovese</hi> had gained ground of
them from the very beginning of the fight, and
were now ready to put them to a totall rout,
when Captain <hi>Goodlake</hi> falling into the reare of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49502:24"/>
the enemies infantry turned the scale so, that
those who before were ready to fly were now
pursuers for the <hi>Savoyards;</hi> Seeing themselves
deserted by their own Horse on both sides, were
no longer able to bear the brunt, but confused<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
breaking their ranks, either ran away or
yeilded themselves to mercy; Yet a small par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of them resolutely maintained the Field till
<hi>Iustiniani</hi> coming in likewise with a party of
Horse, and they now seeing nothing but the
visage of ghastly deaths, presented, threw
down their armes, and cryed for quarter. Thus
was the whole force of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which came to
the assistance of the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
dispersed or taken Prisoners, and the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<hi>Spinola</hi> having loaded Captain <hi>Goodlake</hi>
and <hi>Iustiniani</hi> with the honour of that dayes
victory to pursue his good fortune, immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
advanced with his Army to the Seige of the
Castle of <hi>Flaminii,</hi> a place accounted almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable
both for its situation and fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and won only by the <hi>Savoyards</hi> golden bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
shot into the purse of the treacherous Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
before it he sits down, resolving that
if he could not by force yet by starving he
would gain it before he parted, but gallant
<hi>Goodlake</hi> not approving such delatory proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
(things naturall to the <hi>Italian</hi>) with much
intreaty perswaded him to play his batteries,
though against the opinion of most Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
in the Army, who alledged that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
with <hi>Bafilisco's,</hi> much less with their
small artillery to move those impenitrable wals,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49502:24"/>
that should they make a breach, yet there was
so great a power in the Castle both of officers
Souldiers fled in the late defeate, that it would
be impossible to assault it, or having assaulted to
carry it; That their own numbers within would
soon consume them, and give them an easy vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
but <hi>Spinola</hi> waved all the reasons of his
other Commanders to comply with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of his English Lieutenant General, who used
no other argument to perswade him then that
by how much greater the danger, by so much
more glorious would the conquest be, so the
Artillery incessantly played upon the Castle for
two dayes and nights, which not only terrified
the Defendants, but about the evening of the
second day made a considerable breach in the
wall, which the next morning Captain <hi>Goodlake</hi>
with a choice party assaulted, and after two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses
from his resolute enemies entred, and
left room for the rest of the Army to follow
him, who rather expected to have ransomed
his body to burial, then to have followed his
steps so easily into a place by them thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable.
Here it was that <hi>Spinola</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in at the Castle Gates, began with aston<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment
to admire <hi>Goodlake</hi>'s valour, and to tell
him that whatever honour the <hi>Genoveses</hi> had
gained by these exploits, ought justly to be
transferred upon him, and therefore desired
him to accept of the government of that Castle
which being a frontier, could not be put into
more trusty and valiant hands, but <hi>Goodlake</hi>
taking little notice of his extravagant praises,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49502:25"/>
(as he call'd them) desired first to be excused
from that employment, as delighting more in
field actions, then to be immur'd between
walls: He then presented him the Prisoners he
had taken in the Castle, desiring his mercy for
them, and that they might have liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to their own Country; to which <hi>Spinola</hi>
replyed, That though it was not the usuall
custome of the <hi>Italians</hi> to be so mercifull to
their enemies, yet for his sake (whom he found
endowed with as much compassion as valour) he
was ready to yeild to their release, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he commanded that they might have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to depart; but complements being passed
over, care was taken to refortifie the Garrison,
during which time <hi>Spinola</hi> received Orders
from the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> to lodge there with
his Army, because he had received advice, that
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was with all speed raising a
second Army to regaine that honour which the
first had lost, that he thought no Men were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to combate the second then those who had
been victorious over the first, that for his own
Forces he thought them of strength enough to
engage <hi>Ferrara</hi>'s Duke. This idlenesse, though
it displeased <hi>Spinola,</hi> robbing him as he thought
of some glory, yet was pleasant to him againe,
because he had now the oppertunity to desire
<hi>Goodlake</hi> to continue the story of his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
which he readily assented to; and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued thus.</p>

SPENCER
AND
The Magnanimous Maid.</head>
                           <p>MOST noble friend, what I before told
you of my selfe in particular, was only
as an Introduction to the story of a Person
whose strange variety of fortunes, will certainly
both delight and afflict you, it is the worthy
<hi>Spencer,</hi> whom I'me sure you remember to have
often heard me mention in the relation of my
private misfortunes, as my dearest friend, a
Person he was born of a noble Family, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
an estate suitable to his blood, nor were
his qualities any other then such as might make
him esstemed by all, his friendship indeed was
the only thing that revived my spirits, which
would elce certainly have droopt for the losse
my beloved <hi>Mariana,</hi> he often protesting that
he would be an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ther <hi>Mariana</hi> to me, and that
it should be my fault if ever our friendships
were severed or disturbed; who would not
have rejoyced in so noble a friend, or who
would not lament the losse of him, oh heavens!
the very thoughts of it confound my senses;
(at these words he seemed to be in a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49502:26"/>
which made the generous <hi>Spinola</hi> desist
from interrupting him in breathing forth his
passion, till again recollecting himselfe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued)
The time of my recovery after my
violent Feaver for the losse of my deare <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
was at the same instant, that an Army was
levying to make assault upon <hi>Fiall,</hi> in which
(when the thrice noble Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
General) many of the Gentry of <hi>England</hi>
listed themselves as <hi>Reformadoes</hi> to accompany
so gallant and worthy a Person: I have indeed
heard much (said the generous <hi>Spinola</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
him) of the prowesse and valour of that
renowned Person, which makes it a riddle both
to me, and indeed to all the World, how he
should since by the malice of his enemies be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to so much misfortune, 'tis very true,
continued <hi>Goodlake,</hi> and I have often heard the
<hi>Queen's</hi> judgment highly taxed in throwing
him so easily from her favour, but he was then
(continued he) in his glory, and accounted so
gallant a pattern for the <hi>English</hi> youth, both
of the Gentry and Nobility to follow, that they
strove to emulate one another who should show
himselfe most ready to serve him, amongst the
rest my noble friend <hi>Spencer</hi> engaged himself to
wait upon him in this gallant enterprise, and
that intimate friendship which we had now
contracted, made me rather chuse to quit my
command in the low Countries, then my friend
whom I was resolved nothing but death should
rob me of; nor was he conscious of lesse: eso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>utions
on his part, but being acquainted with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49502:26"/>
my determination to accompany him with most
affectionate embraces told me, that he should
be by me of all Men most happy, having so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and trusty a friend to be a Spectator and
guide of his actions, which would provoke
him to those noble attempts which want of skil
and experience might otherwise detain him
from; I returned him a thanks suitable to the
honour he did me in those expressions, withall
desiring him that we might make all speed pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> for there the whole Fleet was
to randevouze, least by delay (the confluence
of the Gentry to attend upon the Generall in
this voyage being so great) we should be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of those accomodations, which other wise
we might enjoy, he highly approved my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so in three dayes having provided our
selves of all necessaries fitting, we set forward,
but at our arrivall at <hi>Plymouth</hi> found not the
Fleet in so great readinesse as we expected, but
that we might have taken more time to have
given <hi>Conge</hi> to our friends and acquaintance,
yet being now there we thought it a vanity to
return, least so many Ceremonies with them
might in the end hinder us of our intended
voyage, so in that Town we provided our
selves with such lodging as we could get, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving
with patience to attend the motion of
the Fleet, whilst in the mean time the same of
a most beauteous Virgin, who though but of
mean Parents, being but a <hi>Tanners</hi> Daughter of
<hi>Somersetshire,</hi> and at present Servant at a Tavern
in that City) was for her excellent and most
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49502:27"/>
bewitching features, but above all for her sweet
and modest carriage, which seemed to show
somewhat of noblenesse in her beyond her birth
or present condition, stiled the glory of the
West) invited us (out of curiosity to see her)
to goe and repast our selves one afternoon at
her Masters house, whether the same drew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more Customers then we, I confesse at the
first report of her (which was to all Mens seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given somwhat extravangantly) I did believe
her faire, but not such a wonder of beauty as
she was represented, but when I came to see
her, me thought she had somewhat in her that
resembled my dead <hi>Mariana,</hi> and so far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the report I had heard of her, that had not
the remembrance of her restrained me, I had
certainly been taken with her, but the snare I
escaped my deare friend <hi>Spencer</hi> fell into, for
having by some experience made proofe of the
sweetnesse of her disposition, observed her
noble yet modest carriage, he was so passionatly
affected with her, that nothing but enjoyment
could satisfie his desires, for they were not yet
come to that pitch of love as to think of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
one so much beneath him both in birth
and fortunes; You will wonder noble friends
that I trouble your eares with this relation of a
Person of so low condition, but when you shall
have heard the full progresse of their loves, you
will find that which will both delight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
you; no meanes, did my deare <hi>Spencer</hi>
leave unassayed by promises, gifts, courtships,
or whatever elce can or might endeare Man to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49502:27"/>
Woman, to accomplish his desires; but so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable
did he find the rock of her chastity,
though she seemed likewise to expresse a very
great affection for him, but that with such a
modesty as became her birth and the difference
of their fortunes; In sum, after he had made a
tedious triall of her honesty, and endeavoured
but all in vaine to blast her honour, he resolves
with himselfe to marry her, and to me imparts
his resolutions, I was surprized to hear him
speak so much below himselfe, and what then
said I, will you now leave this glorious enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
wherin you have engaged your selfe, and
whereon your eternall honour may depend to
tye your selfe here at home to a Person so much
beneath you in birth and fortunes, a <hi>Tanners</hi>
Daughter, a Tavern Servant, one who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
only sensible of the passion wherein you
burn for her, counterfiets a chastity to you
whilst in this publique place she prostitutes her
selfe to others, Doe not (sayes he in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of passion) prophane so much goodnesse, my
very soule tels me she is all virtue, nor can I
think but my gifts and promises which I believe
have been greater then any others would tempt
her were her spotlesse virtue to be corrupted,
In sum sayes he, should the General himselfe
but tell me she were vicious, I would make him
feel the point of my sword, which I shall as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
draw in defence of her honour, as of my
own life; therefore by the inviolable friendship
contracted between us let me beg you to desist,
from further mentioning her birth, or blemish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49502:28"/>
her fame, for my eares are not capable of
hearing any other sound, then that she is faire
and virtuous; to which I (seeing him so reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute)
replyed, that what I spake, was but the
advice of a true and cordial friend, who prized
his honour as my own, but since I found him so
absolutely determined in his love to <hi>Besse Brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
(for so was that faire Maid called) I would
not only desist to perswade him from it, but
assist him what I could in it, but withall advising
to make some farther tryal of her, and not point
blanck to marry her, for he might easily be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
how great a blemish it would be to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
if she should afterwards be found trainted:
He was so rejoyced to heare these comfortable
words of mine, (for so he termed them) that
clapping his armes about my neck, and kissing
me, oh now sayes he, I know thou art my friend
indeed, but how is it possible (sayes he) that I
can make tryall of her farther, the Fleet being
almost ready to depart, and no excuse can I in
honour make to stay here when they are gone,
you must venture that Sir, (said I) it may be
before the departure of the Fleet somewhat
may happen, which may give you occasion both
to make tryall of her love and honesty, but
little did I think when I spake those words, that
such a fatall occasion would happen indeed, as
there did soon after, for my <hi>Spencer</hi> continuing
his wonted visits to his beloved <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it
happened one day that some Gallants desiring
the sight of her, (for as I told you Sir before,
'twas her same drew Company to the House)
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49502:28"/>
and she not being permitted by <hi>Spencer</hi> to go to
them, they with a boistrous rudenesse, not only
forced into our room, but in a most uncivill
manner began to abuse her mean birth and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state, which so inraged her <hi>Spencer,</hi> that by
a desperate thrust he deprived one of them of
the further use of his tongue, for having now
used it so lavishly, his two friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seeing him
fall easily, gave us way to make an escape to our
lodging, which was pretty private, whether
being come, <hi>Spencer</hi> in an excesse of passion
throwes himself upon the Bed, laments his hard
fortune, curses his stars, and in a desperate man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
would have attempted his own death, had
not I prevented him, yet could not all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
I could use, asswage his extream griefe,
for how (sayes he) can you speak me a word of
comfort, who am reduced to this miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
for my inconsiderate rashnesse has not
only burdned me with the black stain and guilt
of murder, and hath laid me open to an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious
death, but that which above all grieves
me, forces me to lose the presence of a love
so faire, so sweet, so good, so chast, so virtuous
that the World cannot parallel her, oh <hi>Goodlake</hi>
tell me not then of comfort; Alas Sir (said I)
'tis true you have laid your selfe open to all
these inconveniences, but yet the way shun them
or at least remedy them is not this, immoderate
griefe, if you stay here the law as you say will
very speedily pursue you, and what comfort
will it be for you to see me dye with you, could
I dye for you, I should let the World and you
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49502:29"/>
know and see how willingly and undauntedly I
would sacrifice my life for so good a friend,
come Sir cheare up your spirits, there may yet
be remedies to all these miseries, fly and secure
your selfe; Fly and secure my selfe (said he)
why that is my greatest misery that I must be
forced to do so, and leave my love behind me;
That may be but for a short time (said I) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that others (my selfe) have been made
subject to the same frownes of adverse fortune,
let those arguments of yours which were too
powerfull for me to gainsay the flying from my
deare <hi>Mariana,</hi> now prevaile with you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
(said I) you have now an occasion offered
to make tryall of your Loves fidelity, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
she be worthy those attributes which you
are pleased to give her. And art thou still
doubtfull of her virtue? (said he, raising him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
from the Bed) thou shall see me make such
tryall of her constancy, as shall make thee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
her worthy not only of mine, but of the
love of the greatest Prince in <hi>Europe,</hi> but alas!
(continued he) how do we feed our selves with
fancies? how is it possible that we should ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
speak with, or send to her, for that trouble
not your selfe, (said I) but give me your ring
and I will undertake to rid you of that care, he
immediatly slipt it of his finger, and I having
before sent his Boy for one Mr. <hi>Forset,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of whose approved fidelity I had often had
experience in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> he just at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
entred the Chamber, to whom I gave a
full relation of our sad disaster, intreating him
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49502:29"/>
first to provide the best Horses he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
in the Town, and having left them at an
appointed place in the Roade to <hi>Foy,</hi> a Haven
Town in the west of <hi>England,</hi> where one squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
of our Fleet lay under the command of
that famous Cavalier Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> to
go with that Ring to <hi>Besse Bridges,</hi> and acquaint
her with that the owner of it expected her at the
place appointed where we would not faile to
meet her in the dusk of the evening which then
approached; He performed all things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our wish, for when we came thither we
found Horses ready both for our selves and our
men, and scarce had we lookt upon them, but
in came <hi>Forset</hi> &amp; <hi>Besse Bridges</hi> loaden with gold,
for so noble a spirit had this virtuous Maid far
above her birth, and education, that she did not
only desert her Lover in this his extreame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
but likewise brought him fifty pieces out
of her own stock (besides one hundred which
he had left in her custody) fearing least (being
far from his Friends and Country) he might be
surprized and taken before he could send for
money to facilitate his escape, we left the two
Lovers to take their leaves, which was done
with that affection as those who are true Lovers
indeed, are only able to be judges of, and <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>
having returned (her with many applauses
of her fidelity, and vowes never to be any others
then hers) both her fifty pound given her the
hundred pound she had in custody, consigned
over to her his Trunks with things of very rich
value, and allotted her a House in <hi>Foy</hi> part of

of the scandals, and to the envy of the

her honour as a jewell more precious then
beauty or riches, took a sad farewell of her.
And we immediatly Horsing, rad with all speed
possible to <hi>Foy,</hi> where we arrived next morning
early, just at the nick of time that the Fleet had
order to saile, so immediatly getting aboard
the Admirall, we to our thinking bid adieu to

four dayes, that the very Marriners themselves
were abashed, the Souldiers affrighted, and the
Fleet dispersed, not without very great danger
recovered the Coast, where being come, though
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49502:30"/>
others were glad of their safety, yet <hi>Spencer</hi>
grew melancholly, fearing the danger he was
in, should he be discovered, but fortune was so
favourable unto us, that our Ship could not
reach <hi>Plimouth,</hi> so we put into <hi>Falmouth</hi> the
very uttermost part of <hi>England,</hi> yet not very
far distant from <hi>Foy,</hi> where <hi>Spencer</hi> had injoyned
his beloved <hi>Besse Bridges</hi> to reside in an House
of his own, for no small parcell of his estate lay
thereabouts, yet though he was so nigh he durst
not adventure either to goe or send to her, least
some sinister accident might discover him (for
it was given out that he had deserted the Fleet
and was fled another way) and so his covetise
to have but one short sight of her, might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him both of her and his life together, yet
she hearing of the Fleet, being driven back, and
that the Ship which only she and <hi>Forcet</hi> knew, he
was imbarqued upon, was put into <hi>Falmouth,</hi>
not being able to restrain her passion, was more
adventurous then he, but withall cautious, and
therefore recommended to the care of <hi>Forcet</hi>
(whom she knew faithfull) a few lines to this

loves to his dear Mistresse to <hi>Foreet,</hi>
and taken <hi>Conge</hi> of him, he retired himselfe to
to his Cabbin, and spent the most part of that

of his misery that he was forced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from one who so much loved him and was
so much beloved of him; when the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
those thoughts were broke off by the
noyse the Mariners made, which gave him and
me notice the Fleet was again departing,
wherefore getting up, we found our selves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
under sail with a prosperous gale, which
for some dayes we were favoured with, but
being come into the Bay of <hi>Biscaia</hi> were the
second time encountred with a violent storm,
though not so terrible as the first, yet by it we
lost the main yard of our ship which forced
<hi>Rawleigh</hi> with his Squadron to stay behind the
General, and thereby loose him the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of burning the Spanish Fleet in <hi>Faroll,</hi> but
having mended our yard, we made all possible
speed we could after <hi>Essex</hi> who had steered his
course to <hi>Fiall,</hi> but coming there before him,
and being distressed for fresh water, perceiving
likewise from aboard ship that the inhabitants
were packing up their goods to flie, and that
the Haven was commodious to land in, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
staying longer for the General we landed
four miles from the Town, and having routed
a party of <hi>Spaniards</hi> which came thither to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
us, we entered the City, which we found
destitute of inhabitants; I should not trouble

you Sir with a relation of this enterprize which
was so publickly known, if it were not to hint
to you that this very action did contribute
much to the fall of that Gallant <hi>Essex,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
seduced by some evill Counsell as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that <hi>Rawleigh</hi> had made this attempt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to rob him of his glory, and accused that he
had in contempt of him and his authority bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the discipline war by landing without the
consent of the Commander in chief, which
<hi>Essex</hi> greedy of glory, and sensible of ambitious
mind and ill affection towards him, easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
and though he were one of the three
Commanders of the Fleet, publickly checked
him and cashired several Captaines his friends
and favorites, whereby he contracted to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
an enemy, who had not the least hand in
his ruine and destruction: This Town we kept
neer upon two moneths, <hi>Spencer</hi> beginning by
action and absence to shake off his Love Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly,
so that we jovially passed away the
dayes, till about the time of our departure
there happened an accident which of all but
one that I ever felt most afflicted me, as we
were walking together without the walls of
the Town, we espied two Captains earnestly
disputing &amp; each challenging the other to have
basely rob'd him of his honor got in the skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish

<hi>Spencer</hi> perceiving that from words, they began

perswasions, and not at all giving ear to what
he advised them, began desperately to foine at
one another, when <hi>Spencer</hi> extending his
piety so far, as to endeavour the parting of
them, received a wound (to all our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions)

friendship to desist from any such attempt, and
withall advised the two Captains to take care
of their own safety, which generous offer of his
they (having first expressed their sorrow, for
having unwillingly abused his too noble spirit)
accepted, and left me alone with my (to my
best apprehension) dying friend, who I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by all means to comfort in this his last
condition; nor was he of himself uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
but rather seeming not at all dejected,
bid welcom to his death, which he confessed a
just revenge of his having so rashly and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
slaine the Gentleman at <hi>Plymouth;</hi> this
was the sum of his discourse to himself whilest
I was busied in binding up his wound, which
bled so fast, that I was fearfull that if perchance
the wound might happen not to be mortal, yet
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49502:34"/>
the too violent effusion of blood might deprive
him of his life, and so it almost had, for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
my endeavours (which though
they were the utmost I could do, were but
poor in themselves) he was in a manner abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
fainted away before I could get any as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
to help me carry him to the town,
but at length before he was quite spent, there
came in three or four Souldiers, running not
so much to assist him as to seize me for his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
for they no sooner arrived at us, but they
began violently to lay hands upon me, so that
to have freed my selfe from their causelesse
gripes, I had like to have committed that upon
some of them which I was falsly supposed to
have done upon <hi>Spencer,</hi> and their rudenesse
(for so I interpreted that) had assuredly been
the cause of my sending some of them to their
eternal mansion, had not one who seemed to
have some influences over the rest, commanded
them to desist from further oppressing me, and
withall told me that my opposing my selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their numbers, would not only prove a
piece of desperation rather than vallor, but
would likewise increase my guilt; I forced him
to stop at that word guilt, for I wondered I
must confesse extreamly what he meant by it,
and therefore earnestly pressed him to tell me
from whence such discourses might proceed;
from whence (said he) can you imagine, but
from the death of that Gentleman (pointing to
<hi>Spencer;)</hi> I was more amazed then before to
hear him say so, yet had lesse cause; for I now
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49502:34"/>
supposed that the two Captains fearing least I
should not be so generous as to make good my
<hi>Spencers</hi> promise to them, and ingagement of me
not to reveal them, had resolved (hoping him
absolutely dead) by this stratagem to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
my life, and so the better acq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
in which imaginations I had almost
broken that tie of friendship wherein <hi>Spencer</hi>
had bound me not to disclose them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
them as the actors of that Tragedy,
but recollecting my self, and observing that
the Gentleman had taken notice of my discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure,
and still expected what answer I would
make to his charge; I told him, That by what
he had said, I might easily guesse that they were
come thither to apprehend me for the supposed
murder of that Gentleman, that I was very well
content to yeild my selfe his prisoner, though
I were innocent of the least thought of such an
action, which without the prosecution of the
Law I should sufficiently demonstrate by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in execution my resolve not long to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
him, That I had yet some hopes that his
wound was not mortal, but that the great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of blood had brought him into that
weak condition, out of which some care might
perhaps bring him at least for so long time as
that he might clear me, for though (said I) I
am resolved to follow him in death, I would
not willingly do it with the aspersion of being his
murderer; and therefore I craved the assistance
of some of those that attended him to carry
the body of my dear friend into the town,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49502:35"/>where we might have the help of some Surgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not only to bring him again to those senses
which he had lost with excesse of bleeding,
but likewise to give judgment upon the wound,
and if pssible effect his cure: The Gentleman
very readily assented to what I desired, and
having commanded some of those that were
there, to take up the body with all tendernesse
possible, and others to guard me (though I
tould him it was unnecessary, for I would not
flie from the body of my so dear friend, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it were to find out some death) we soon
reached the town, and as soon after by the
help of a Chyrurgion belonging to a Merchants
ship then in the Road, my dear friend reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
his senses, and lifting up his eyes (not
knowing well where he was) he was a good
while silent, till espying me; And art thou
there my dear <hi>Goodlake</hi> (said he) have the fates
been so happy then as to permit me once again
to see thee before I die? then are my joyes
compleat, and I shall willingly yeild my selfe
into the jaws of death, if that cruell Tyrant
will but give me so much time as to lay some
commands upon you, which I shall injoyn you
to be true to; these words and his relation that
endeavouring to part two persons strangers to
him, he by chance from one of their swords
received that fatal wound, acquitted me in all
mens judgements, so the guard was dismissed,
but the Gentleman who commanded them
would have stayed longer, had not there at
that instant come in a messenger, who acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49502:35"/>
him that al persons whatsoever belonging to
the Fleet, were by the General commanded
immediately to repair to their several ships up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pain of death, for the Fleet was even ready
to set sail, whereupon having wished me all
happinesse, and <hi>Spencer</hi> the recovery of his
health, he took his leave, and I having waited
on him forth, and returned him a due thanks
for his civility, made hast in again to enjoy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
the company of my dear friend, whom I
found in a manner even ready to give up the
ghost, his faintnesse having again seized him,
yet at sight of me he seemed somwhat comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and rearing himselfe up in the bed, told
me that he had several commands to lay upon
me, which he would conjure me by all the ties
of friendship, by all the obligations he had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me, by his last dying words punctually to
obey; O Lord! sir, (said I) think not that I
have or can have any power to obey any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
whatsoever, except it be to follow you in
death; but why should I talk of death since
there is yet hopes that you may live, and I live
happy in the enjoyment of your friendship;
flatter not your selfe (said he) with any such
vain thoughts, for I find death to have even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
seazed me, but let me command you
live, that since I must die I may rest in peace;
since then (repli'd I) you think my life necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the quiet and rest of your soul, I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to live, if it be but so long as till I
fulfilled your injunctions, which be they what
they will, I here protest by those indissoluble
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49502:36"/>
bonds of friendship which have been so often
confirmed betwixt us inviolably to perform;
here I stopped, expecting what he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
me, but he first desired me to take out of
his pocket a bundle of Papers wrapt up in a
scroule of parchment, in which sayes he you
will find my last Will and Testament; I accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his desire took out the bundle and, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
found it out, what is your further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
concerning this (said I) That Will (said
he I confirme my last, therein thou wilt find
that I have divided my whole estate between
thee my dear friend, and my beloved <hi>Bess
Bridges,</hi> but with this proviso, that if thou
shalt find her in the least tainted, or to have
falsified that faith wherewith she made her self
mine, that five hundred pound <hi>per annum</hi>
which I had resolved to estate her in, let me
beg of thee likewise to accept, and in requital
of it to obey these easie commands; First, That
thou wilt restone this Ring to my beloved <hi>Besse,</hi>
the last pledge she gave me of her faith, which
if she have kept intire, will rejoyce her heart,
and ease it somewhat of griefe for my death, if
not, 'twill be a strong witnesse against her to
condemn her as the most light, inconftant, and
very woman, in the world; secondly, That if
thou-shalt find that she hath either broke her
faith, or forfeited her honour, thou wilt not
fail to take from her my picture, which how
unworthy soever, is too good to be enjoyed
or breathed on by one unchast; and thirdly,
that thou wouldest make what hast possible
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49502:36"/>
thou canst to the ship, least thou lose the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of this passage, and leave me to my
fate, farewell; Farewell? (said I) O ye Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens!
and is <hi>Spencer</hi> then so unkind as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
me from him? this command doth more
afflict me then when he bid me live; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his presence I am but dead in my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
but to be forced from him when he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ready to render his soul to heaven, is worse
then death! either (said I) command me not
from you, or command me not to live: If
(said <hi>Spencer)</hi> the peace of my mind were not
concerned in your absence, I should be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to be deprived of you, as you seem
willing to be deprived of you, as you seem
willing to die for my sake; but since neither
my dying desires, nor our former ties of
friendship can work upon you to leave me, I
must rest content, and as well as I can, pacifie
my spirits: Nay, now (said I) you are unjust,
if my earnest love made me speak somewhat
disgustfull, what reason have you to blame me?
I will go, but who shall then close up your dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eyes? who shall see you interred? what
friend shall weep a tear upon your funerall
hearse? must it be added to the rest of my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that I cannot perform the last duty of
a friend to you? for that (said he) trouble not
your selfe, and ad not your afflictions to the
heap of my miseries, you are not the first that
has lost a friend, but the first (repli'd I) that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
lost so faithfull a friend, farewell, for I
cannot stay here and obey your commands,
farewell; that word parted us, for since his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49502:37"/>
injunctions were so absolute, I thought it
would but ad to his griefe, and perhaps hasten
his death to stay longer, so having with a heavy
heart given the Surgion charge of him, and
left him a sufficient number of crowns, I hasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on ship-board, having no desire now to live,
but to obey his commands; being arrived on
ship-board and under saile, we might hear the
Great Bell of the City toul, which was as it
were a sad Omen of that newes I after heard,
and which made me inquisitive into the cause of
some Mariners, who having staid too late, pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Fleet in a swift <hi>Fellucca,</hi> at length over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
us, who told me what my own fears pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
that it was for one <hi>Spencer</hi> a Gentleman,
and well known in the Fleet, who was just at
their leaving the town, dead of a mortal
wound; all these circumstances confirmed it
was my dear friend, nor could I refrain so
much my passions, but that overwhelmed with
grief, I fell down upon the Deck, and had not
the great care of my friends and acquaintance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
revived me, I had been made incapable of
ever performing the injunctions of my dead
friend, yet what with their perswasions and the
comfort I had of having some service to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
to his memory, I asswaged my grief, and
began to bethink my selfe how I might careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
observe his commands, they were outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
easie, but whosoever considers how close
women are in their actions, will judge it a
hard task to prove them unchast, yet at length
I bethought my self that Mr. <hi>Forcet</hi> the person
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49502:37"/>
who assisted us in our escape from <hi>Plimouth,</hi>
might very possibly give me an account of the
since carriage and deportment of <hi>Bess Bridges;</hi>
he having expressed to me his intention of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding
at <hi>Foy,</hi> where this Magnanimous Maid
(for so when you have heard her gallant deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
you will think her worthy to be called)
was by her lover enjoyned to live; to him
therefore at my arrival (which was after a very

which she fell into at parting from her beloved
<hi>Spencer,</hi> but she began to repeat what he had
left her in charge, and first said she virtue and
chastity, did then my <hi>Spencer</hi> doubt or mistrust
me, oh no, 'twas love, 'twas love, and care of
me (said she correcting her selfe) that made him
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49502:38"/>
give me that counsell, else why should he be so
auxious and carefull for my being, and surely
would have been so for my wel-being, my living
chast and virtuous, had it been in his power, to
me then that remaines which when I forgoe, or
make forfeite of my honour or faith to him
plighted, let me not be thought unworthy of
my <hi>Spencer,</hi> but to live upon the Earth, here
she began again to lament her misfortune, which
had made her so miserable as to be deprived of
her <hi>Spencer,</hi> when she had but just been made
sensible of his ardent love and affection to her,
and had assuredly fell into a second swound, had
not I endeavoured by all possible arguments to
comfort her, and divert those thoughts, by
putting her in mind of his charge, for her spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
removall to <hi>Foy,</hi> which she delayed no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then the succeeding day, when making even
accounts with her Master, and taking care to
pack up those goods which were left her by
Master <hi>Spencer,</hi> (but especially taking care to
preserve his picture, which she kissed ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times, with as much affection as if it had
not been the dull representation, but her reall
living love,) she in very few dayes removed
from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and in as few more was setled
at the <hi>Windmill</hi> in <hi>Foy,</hi> whither her same spread
all over <hi>England,</hi> drew her such custome that
she was the envy of all those of her Trade, I
wonder (said <hi>Spinola</hi> interrupting his valiant
Lord Generall) that Master <hi>Spencer</hi> being so
much inamoured of her beauty and virtues,
having an estate so great, and being a Gentleman
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49502:39"/>
of such quality, did not rather provide a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
appartment, or habitation like a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
or at least a Person he thought worthy
his affection, rather then expose her again to
the publick temptation of the World: (Your
Objection answered) Captain <hi>Goodlake</hi> is no
more then what I expected, and what I my self
had very often made to himselfe, but could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
get any farther reason of that action from
him, then that thereby he should make the
greater tryall of her virtues: but in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(replyed <hi>Spinola)</hi> the tryall was too ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous
of a Person whom he so intirely affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
You say true, (said <hi>Goodlake)</hi> but there is
no disputing the reasons of past actions, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
such as spring from the private bosomes
of particular Personages, but (continued he)
to proceed in <hi>Forset</hi>'s relation, amongst these
many Guests (said he) there could not want
some who would prove Suitors to such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
face, especially when they perceived
that it was likewise embellished with virtue,
and that set forth by no despicable estate, which
the stock left her by Master <hi>Spencer</hi> had in small
time acquire, amongst the rest there was one
Master <hi>Hopton,</hi> a Gentleman of a very good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and great revenue in that Country, who
for a long time laboured in her love, nor was
he wanting to endeavour to force her to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of such presents as he would dayly
send, but such was the noblenesse of her mind,
that she would not accept of the price, where
she could not make good the bargain expected,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49502:39"/>
                              <hi>love,</hi> Nay so generous was she, that (contrary
to the common humour of that Sex, who love
not only to have many Suitors, but to lull them
still on in hopes of their desires) she not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the poor Gentleman to languish in vain
expectations of what he could never obtain, he
had no sooner discovered his passion, but she
plainly told him, that her love was not hers to
give, being already disposed to one, with whom
should she break her faith, she had just reason to
suspect she should not only be abhorred by all
Persons whatsoever, but especially by him who
so earnestly solicited her to it, yet this answer
did not at all satisfy my young Gallant, who
with no lesse eagerness then before stil pursued
his suite, till finding by her continuall repulses
there was left no hopes of victory, he resolved
upon travell, as the fittest cure for his lovesick
mind, should I (said <hi>Forset</hi>) give you a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
account of all her Suitors, I should make
the relation tedious, and spend as much time
in it, as there was spent in their severall actions,
I shall therefore only particularize two more.</p>
                           <p>But as Captain <hi>Goodlake</hi> was going forward
in this story came a Messenger in, whose coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
betrayed the hast of what he had to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,
yet so much breath had he lost by his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
running, mixt with feare, that a good
while it was before the illustrious <hi>Spinola</hi> could
make him deliver his message, which at length
they understood to be caused by a suddain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursion
of about five thousand <hi>Savoyards</hi> upon
the Camp, for the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> incensed at
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49502:40"/>
the last defeat of his Forces, had with all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
speed raised another Army, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to march night and day, till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
their rout, and regained the honour lost
by their Countrymen, these expresse Orders
joyned with the vigilancy of their Generall
made them fly with such speed that they even
like <hi>Caesar</hi> outwent the report of their coming,
and (still in their way recruting themselves with
such as either fled from the other Battell, or
whom the charity of <hi>Spinola,</hi> at Captain <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lake</hi>'s
request had released at the storm of the
Castle) they were come within view of the
<hi>Genovese</hi> Camp before they had (such was their
security, and the negligence of the Scouts) any
notice or advice of their coming, which suddain
surprize had so much disordered them, that
without speedy help they must necessarily fall
into an inevitable ruine, this news extreamly
stratled the two valiant Captaines, but not at
all abated their wonted courage, nor lessened in
them the care to assist their distressed Camp,
wherefore <hi>Spinola</hi> drawing out a selected party
of Foot out of the Garrison, and <hi>Goodlake</hi> the
like of Horse, they seemed to fly to the assistance
of their friends, spurred on not only by their
own innate valour, but by the earnest desire
they had still to maintain, and keep alive that
honour, which by the last <hi>Campagna</hi> they had so
happily given birth to; Scarce were they come
within sight of their almost scattered Troops,
but their Souldiers having advice that their
Generals were posting to their reliefe, began
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49502:40"/>
to encourage their fellows, and gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
into severall close battalious, first put
a stand, to the pursuing fury of the <hi>Savoyards,</hi>
this unexpected sight made their Commanders
spur on more eagerly to the reliefe of those
Souldiers, who so valiantly maintained their
grounds and their Countrys honour, whilst
the <hi>Savoyards</hi> angry to see a stop put to their
full hopes, and almost assurance of an absolute
victory, pressed with more fury upon their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
whose present valour they accounted
but like the blaze of a dying Taper before its
extinction, and indeed so it had proved, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the great care and valour of <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niano,</hi>
who resolutely adventured his Person a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the thickest and most daring of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
thereby to double the courage of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
wearied Souldiers) had not <hi>Spinola</hi> and
<hi>Goodlake</hi> come in with their opportune assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
the first that arrived was <hi>Goodlake,</hi> who
having wheeled about, fell into the Enemies
Flank with such a brave resolution, that at the
first charge he put them into disorder, but such
was their courage that (notwithstanding his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
here, and that <hi>Spinola</hi> with his fresh
supply of gallant infantry the <hi>Savoyards</hi> were
forced to give some ground) spurred on with
their confidence of victory that rather renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then abating their fury, they continued the
battell till the darknesse of the night parted
both Armies, and forced them to an unvolun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
retreat on both sides, the <hi>Genoveses</hi> being
forced notwithstanding their gallant resistance,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49502:41"/>
to yeild so much of the victory to their enemies
as to give them leave to passe freely into the
Territorie of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and joyne
with the <hi>Ferrarian</hi> Forces, which more grieved
the generous <hi>Spinola,</hi> valiant <hi>Goodlake,</hi> and the
noble <hi>Iustinino,</hi> then the wounds they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the battell, but finding it in vain to
repine at their ill fortune, they thought it fitter
to retire to the Castle to consult of Deeds then
to rest there by helplesse words to bemoane
their ill successe.</p>

                        <p>STrange was the passion that possessed the
generous <hi>Spinola</hi> for the last days over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
and willingly would he have thrown
by all thoughts of redressing it, to have
prosecuted his revenge on those by whose neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
it sprung, had not <hi>Goodlake</hi> perswaded
him that it was now no time to think of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but rather to consult of some means to
redeem not the loss of honor, for he was sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of no such thing, whilest though the enemy
had gained the pass, they yet stood upon equal
terms with them, but the regaining the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
they had got, which might by a speedy
pursuit easily be done, and they yet either dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out of the <hi>Mantouse</hi> Territories, or utterly
cut off; that the whole Army seemed to him
guilty of the yesterdays neglect, and though
some might seem more concerned then others,
and according to the strict rule of Martial disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49502:42"/>
might deserve a severe punishment: yet
in this pinch of necessary service required from
them, it would seem a great deal better to pass
it by, they now wanting rather encouragements
to spur them on, then punishments of some few,
to damp the courage of the rest. That he might
easily discern by the Armies courage, and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
endeavors by force, to regain what by
want of care they had lost, that they were so
really sorry for their negligence, that they were
willing to expiate that crime with their bloods.
That therefore he should lay aside all thoughts
of rigor, and (only by some words making them
ashamed of their fault) by a free pardon beget
in them in a desire of amendment. Though the
worthy <hi>Spinola</hi> was very sensible that this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of his Lieutenant Generals was most seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
yet whether swayed by his passion, or
out of inbred hate to that family, he would not
rest satisfied till a Captain of the house of the
<hi>Grimaldi</hi>'s (who having that night the charge
of the watch, was therefore thought most culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
was called to answer the surprize, and
assuredly his death had onely sufficed to expiate
his neglect, had not those great services he had
often performed, the murmurs of the Soldiers,
and <hi>Goodlakes</hi> perswasions, overswaied <hi>Spinola's</hi>
intentions, who finding that his death would
probably breed a mutiny, or worse discontents
in the Army, though it would better suit with
his honor and <hi>Grandezza,</hi> to give that life free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which he could not take away with safety,
and therefore having first at large laid down the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49502:42"/>
penalties due to those neglects, whereof he had
confessed himself guilty; he concluded, that
though the world might very well believe that
the enmities between their families, might make
him rejoyce at so just an occasion offered, to
take away the life of one of the <hi>Grimaldi</hi>'s yet
no thoughts of private enmity, or revenge,
could restrain him from giving due honor and
respect to his very enemies, that his former
services sounded so loud in his ears, that for their
sake he was content to remit the present forfeit
of his life, not doubting but he would by fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
services so redeem the fault, that his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
should think him deserving of the pardon.
The Captain returned him a thankful answer,
but in such doubtful terms, that he might easily
guess that he thought his life more due to the
love of the Soldiery, then to <hi>Spinola</hi>'s curtefie,
concluding his Speech more clearly, by telling
him, that he hoped his Country should never
have occasion to think either him, or any of his
Family, unworthy of life, whilest though they
never had the happiness to arrive to that height
of command, which some of other Familes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
less worthy, had been entrusted with; yet
none should be more ready then they to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
their utmost abilities to its service.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Spinola,</hi> though he knew these words were le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
at him, yet so brideled his passion, that
returning him no other answer, then that he did
not doubt but the Duke and Senate were well
satisfied with the worth of those whom they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
that though they could not advance
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49502:43"/>
every man who deserved it to a supream com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
yet their favor would shine no less clear
upon that Captain, who faithfully discharged his
trust as upon their General himself; that it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
some thing of self-guiltiness, at least self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit,
to arrogate to ones self a reward of
imagined merits; that for his, he wished they
might prove so clear, that the Senate might think
him fit to confer upon him the Generalship of
their Army, which when so, he should willingly
resign it; and therewith dismissing him to his
charge, he gave order that the Army should
immediately be put in a posture to pursue their
enemy, and if possibly, hinder their conjunction
with the Forces of <hi>Ferrara;</hi> his commands were
immediately obeyed, and the whole body both
of horse and foot were in very few hours upon
their march after their foes, but with very small
hopes of reaching them, for finding their Army
extreamly broken, they adventured not to stand
another shock, but in the dead of the night were
marched away with an incredible speed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to joyn with the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who
then with a potent Army faced the <hi>Mantouese;</hi>
their flight more animated the generous <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola,</hi>
and his whole Army, who now looking
upon then as conquered, and pursued, fied
with the wings of revenge to arrive at an easie
slaughter; but they were deceived in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations,
for after two days march, they had
advice that the enemies Army, being increased
with the addition of two thousand <hi>Ferrareses,</hi>
was turning back to encounter them; nor long
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49502:43"/>
had they received this news, but a messenger
arrived, who all bloody and trembling, related
to them the cause of their enemies advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, which they were before almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
of, his very countenance betrayed the
ill news he brought, nor need <hi>Spinola</hi> ask him
what it was, for with a kinde of stammering he
began to tell him, That the Armies of the two
Dukes having several days faced each other, the
soldiers of either side by continual skirmishes
still provoking their enemies to the battel, at
length by a joynt consent, drew out their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and on the spacious plains of <hi>Miraneula,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
so terrible a battel, that the Sun, though but
newly risen from his warry bed, not daring to
look upon such ghastly deaths as each side strove
to give the other, crouded himself under the
blackest and most dismal clouds, whilest the
two hosts with various fortune disputed the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
till about the time when the Sun having
arrived to his greatest height, began again to
decline; Fortune seemed most to favor us, for
the right wing of the enemy was absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated,
and their main battel began to give
ground, so that we were in a maner assured of
victory; our shouts of joy ecchoing our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to the skies, but alas! Fortune did onely
flatter us, for what we gained on one side, we
lost on the other, for our right wing began ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
to give ground, and by the valor of one
sole stranger was in a maner defeated. Gods!
with what fury did he pierce our Squadrons? his
victorious sword like an overthrowing thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49502:44"/>
tumbling down all before it? how did he
make our greatest spirits bow, as if death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
had been entailed on his arm, yet
could not touch his body? In sum, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the valiant <hi>Lorenzo</hi> posted with a fresh
supply of horse, to the assistance of our all-most
scattered wing, as if his indefatigable arm knew
no weariness, he flew like lightning amongst
our bravest troops, and seconded by a select
party (and who would refuse to follow so gallant
a Commander?) quickly forced them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
their before-wearied fellows in a
shameful flight. This success put a new courage
into their Main battel, so that again regaining
their ground, they maintained a sharp fight with
us, yet something doubtful, till the valiant
stranger, having left sufficient numbers to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
our defeated right wing, attacqued us with
his Troops, which struck such a pannick fear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the coward heart of our soldiers, that if hell
with all its terrors had affaulted them, it could
not more have appaled their dastard spirits; for
as if they knew no resistance for his victorious
arm, they immediately threw down their Arms,
and with al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>speed fled towards <hi>Mirandola;</hi> the
victorious enemy spurred on by revenge, still
pursuing and sacrificing to <hi>Bellona</hi> thousands of
their coward-souls.</p>
                        <p>Captain <hi>Goodlake</hi> all the while the messenger
was making this relation, was meditating who
this mirror of courage should be, and no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
able to restrain his desire of knowing him,
here interrupted him, by demanding if he knew
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49502:44"/>
of what Country the valiant stranger was? Sir,
answered the messenger, I know him no farther
then by the effects of his valor, which were so
prodigious, that it makes me believe those which
I formerly thought fables of the antient <hi>Hero's</hi>
might be truths, and that some of their noble
souls might be transmugrated into this mans
body; Heavens how did our best Commanders
yield up their souls when ever his sword was
pleased to command them; the valiant <hi>Lorenzo</hi>
that famous soldier, <hi>Petruchio, Horatio, Alonzo,</hi>
and the too young and too valiant <hi>Schiarra,</hi>
were all made dead Trophies of his living va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor.
And is <hi>Schiarra</hi> then dead? said <hi>Spinola,</hi>
interrupting him; he is, said the messenger, and
with him dead all our hopes of courage, or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
He was indeed a person (said <hi>Spinola,</hi>
turning to Captain <hi>Goodlake)</hi> to whom the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
seem'd to strive, which should be most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
of their bounties, a youth beloved both of
Gods and men, affable, courteous, noble, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
valiant, and no way deserving so hard a
fate; but how did the noble Duke escape, said
he to the messenger, or is he dead? or rather
fallen into the hands of his triumphantenemies,
tell us, that we may hear all our miseries toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
The Gods have yet preserved the noble
Duke, replied the messenger, yet to trie the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of another day, if he can but again rally up
his scattered forces, which we have some hopes
may be done, for as yet the whole left wing of
our horse remains entire, who onely now watch
an opportunity to joyn again to the rest of his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49502:45"/>
scattered Army; and though the slaughter was
great on our side, yet was not the victory cheap
on the enemies, for the greatest part of their
right wing was cut off, or taken prisoners, and
no small number fell in their Main battel; our
Musters at present in <hi>Mirandola</hi> amounnt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
seven thousand foot, and two thousand
horse, so that were your Army joyned with ours,
and our left wing come up, we might presume,
notwithstanding their conjunction with the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyards,</hi>
again to take the field.</p>
                        <p>At these words there came in one of the
Scouts to acquaint the General that the <hi>Savoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
strengthened with two thousand <hi>Ferrarese,</hi>
were now within three leagues of him, and made
all possible speed to arrive him before night,
whereupon laying aside all other affairs, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
called a Counsel of War, to consult
what was fittest to be done, some advised that
the best course was to make a swift retreat to
the Castle of the <hi>Flaminii,</hi> and there strongly
encamp themselves till they could get relief, it
being impossible that with half the number of
their enemies (for they were no more) they
should be able to stand out an encounter; but
both the generous <hi>Spinola,</hi> and Captain <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lake,</hi>
were of a contrary judgement, and rather
inclined to fight them, which opinion of theirs
being seconded by the valiant soldiery, who
filled the skies with loud exclamations, that
they would never flie them were they thrice as
many, that they would never doubt of victory,
whilest their valiant General, and Lieutenant
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49502:45"/>
General were with them, and that therefore they
should not stay their coming, but advance;
these Ecchoes, I say, of the soldiers, to the votes
of <hi>Spinola,</hi> and <hi>Goodlake,</hi> made those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were for a retreat, quickly change their
mindes and consent to a battel; so the Army
dislodged, and about the time that the Sun had
made two hours descent towards the Western
Ocean, attacqued their enemies, who confident
in their numbers, and looking upon this encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the <hi>Genoueses</hi> as an act rather of furie and
desperation, then wisdom and valor, assured
themselves of an absolute victory, and had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
divided among themselves the <hi>Genouese</hi>
Nobles, and proportioned their Ransoms; but
had they not been so confident of a conquest,
they might perhaps have conquered, whilest
their thoughts of its certainty utterly lost it, for
both the Commanders and common Soldiers,
assured in their numbers, neglecting their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
ran themselves into inevitable ruine, which
yet they perceived not till they saw themselves
utterly deserted by their horse, (whom the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<hi>Goodlake</hi> on the one side, and the Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Pallavicini</hi> on the other, (for the gallant <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiniano</hi>
lost his life at the first charge) had utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
routed) when the main body of Infantry drew
up closer together, resolving either to gain the
victory, or to sell their lives at a dear rate, in
recompence of their folly; this last indeed they
effected, for they maintained the fight till near
Sun-set, though galled on both sides by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
horse, with an infinite slaughter of their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49502:46"/>
enemies, to whose swords they were no less
made sacrifices, till at length wearied out, and
hemmed in on all sides, tow thousand three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
the remains of four thousand Infantry,
yielded themselves to the mercy of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors.</p>
                        <p>This Victory put the <hi>Mantuan</hi> affairs again
into a gallant posture, the news of it much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced
the Duke, who was then anew compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his before-broken Army at <hi>Mirandola;</hi> but
more was he rejoiced at the arrival of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Spinola</hi> there, whom he received withal ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
pomp and splendor, and he having first
presented the prisoners taken in the last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
next recommended unto him his valiant
Lieutenant General <hi>Goodlake,</hi> as a person to
whom, though a stranger, he ought all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
happiness; the Duke amazed at his great
Obligations, to one whom he had never yet seen,
immediately sent for him, and he as readily
obeyed his summons; when being come into the
presence, where the Duke sat in his Chair of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
having made his obeisance, he kneeled
down, but his Highness not permitting that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
fit onely for Subjects, to one to whom he
acknowledged himself beholding both for his
life and Dukedom, rising from his Chair, and
taking him into his embraces, told him, that
he understood by the generous <hi>Spinola,</hi> that he
was the person to whose gallantry he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
for all his good Fortunes, that his Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
were so much the greater by how much
they proceeded from a person whom he had no
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49502:46"/>
way obliged; that for the future, he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor
with all possible address to quit the score
of his debts, which were so many and so great,
that it was impossible that a short time should
finde out a proportionable recompence; that he
would therefore make it his future study, and
that now he did not doubt to vie Forces and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor
to his enemy of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> since as well as he
had a Stranger, and a valiant Stranger to be his
Champion. Captain <hi>Goodlake</hi> endeavored to
return a suitable answer to his over-civil recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him (for so he stiled it) by telling him
that the Noble <hi>Spinola</hi> had wronged both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and him, the first by robbing himself of that
honor which was onely due to his worth, and
the second by attributing to him things far above
his deserts; that if he had done any acceptable
service to his Highness, 'twas sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced
in being accepted, &amp; that he should
alwayes account it the greatest honor could
accrue to him to spend his life in so just a cause
as his. Many complements of the like nature
passed till such time as the Duke thought it fit
time to conduct these two gallant Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to their appartment, which he did himself
in person, leaving them into a room richly hung
with Arras, and fit for the entertainment of so
Noble Guests, where leaving them alone;
Captain <hi>Goodlake</hi> perceived that a strange and
unusual melancholy had seized upon the worthy
<hi>Spinola,</hi> and that he whose comportment used to
be always pleasant and Debonaire, was now
dull and heavy, he would not presently trouble
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49502:47"/>
him to demand the reason of it, hoping it was
but some sudden fit which soon would be past
over, but finding it to continue, and rather aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then decrease, he interrupted his fixt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations,
by telling him, That he was not sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of any accident which had happened, which
might deserve of him so great a dejection, or if
there were, that he could not but imagine that
his friendship to him was lessened, whilest he
kept from him the cause of his sorrow, who
had made him partaker of all his griefs. The
Noble <hi>Spinola</hi> at these words awaked as it were
out of a dream, looking stedfastly upon him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied;
My griefs are now, dear friend, made
in some measure parralel with thine, for I have
lost a friend whom I prized above my very soul,
my dear friend <hi>Schiarra. Schiarra,</hi> replied
<hi>Goodlake,</hi> was that generous youth whom the
messenger, who brought us advice of the Dukes
defeat, reported to be slain by the hands of the
Stranger, who in <hi>Ferrura</hi>'s cause performed such
wonders, so much your friend as to deserve such
sorrow? Our friendship, replied <hi>Spinola,</hi> was
so firm, that nothing but death and envious fate
could have separated, or broken it. I confess,
said <hi>Goodlake,</hi> I perceived at the first relation of
the news, that your countenance strangely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
though I could not then guess the cause of
it; but since you have been pleased to make
me, I know not whether I may say happy or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
in its knowledge, let me further conjure
you by those noble favors you have already done
me, to give a relation of that person, for I know
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49502:47"/>
he must have been one in all things worthy, who
could from you merit so entire a friendship.
Though it will but be a renewing of the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of my sorrows, replied <hi>Spinola,</hi> I have been
so much obliged to you for the relation of your
own, and some part of the Fortunes of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Spencer,</hi> that I cannot deny you this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
and perhaps it may prove a disburdner of
my sorrows to impart them.</p>

                           <p>KNow then noble friend (continued <hi>Spinola)</hi>
that when I arrived to about the third Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre,
my Uncle <hi>Ambrogio Spinola,</hi> to whose care
I was committed by my Father during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
in the Netherlands, thought me at an
age fit to intrust me with the sight of other
Countries, as looking upon travel as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livener
of the soul, and stirrer up of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
mindes to an emulation of other vertues,
and because the glory and splendor of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi>
(by reason of the absolute Government
of the <hi>Medici</hi> Dukes of <hi>Tuscany)</hi> seem'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
that of all other <hi>Italian</hi> Cities, he sent me
thither, recommanding me to Signor <hi>Alonzo
Schiarra,</hi> an ancient Nobleman of that City,
and both a great friend of, and somewhat alied
unto those of our Family; I was received by
him with all possible expressions of Love and
Affection, with protestations of having the same
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49502:48"/>
care of me that he would have of his own and
onely Son <hi>Giorgio Schiarra,</hi> a youth of about
twelve years of age, of a sweet and affable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
comely carriage and behavior, and with
all exceeding beautiful, with him I associated
my self in learning those excercises of riding,
fencing, and other qualities and studies which
the Nobility of <hi>Italy</hi> do most delight in, and
generally breed up their sons, to the better to
enable them when they should arrive at riper
years to serve their Country; such was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
that we took in each others company, and
so did our friendship flourish in those our tender
years, that it grew up as it were to an inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
bond, to the great delight of the old <hi>Alonzo,</hi>
who gloried to see how we strove more and
more to endear our selves together, and yet
would endeavour to exceed each other in duty
and respect to him, so that he would often say,
that if we had but both been his children, no
Father could have boasted a happiness like his;
thus we lived together for about three years,
and upwards, never parting by our good wills
neither night nor day, or if by any chance we
were for some time forced to be asunder, that
time was either spent in dull melancholly, or in
pouring forth prayers for each others safety; but
whilest we thus lived in all bliss and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
imaginable, adverse Fortune renewed
an old Feud, which had long lain asleep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Families of the <hi>Schiarri</hi> and the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati,</hi>
a Family observed to be most guilty
(though they had least cause) of pride of any
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49502:48"/>
one in <hi>Florence;</hi> the occasion of the raking up
the embers of this long concealed fire, were so
slight, that they are not worth relating, let it
suffice that it soon grew into such a flame, as
disturbed the whole City of <hi>Florence,</hi> and many
murders were committed on both sides, <hi>Alme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righo
Donati,</hi> son to <hi>Lorenzo Donati,</hi> one of the
chief of that Family, was the first that felt the
fury of this difference by the loss of his life,
which was too soon revenged upon <hi>Giovanni
Schiarra,</hi> a youth in whom all Nobleness flow'd,
but of too tender years to be made a concern in
this bloody difference, who being set upon by
three of the opposite Family, though he bravely
defended himself, being overpowred, was made
a sacrifice to their revenge. This baseness ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
heightned the difference, yet it made
somewhat well for the <hi>Schiarri,</hi> who gained
thereby the friendship of almost the whole
City, for they generally condemned the <hi>Donati</hi>
for committing so horrid and unworthy a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
upon the person of one so young and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that he scarce yet knew the handling of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
Arms; in sum, scarce a day passed but
either wounds or deaths given or taken; yet my
<hi>Schiarra</hi> and I passed unaffronted, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
not from any want of malice in the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati</hi>
to him, for they particularly coveted his
death as the son, and onely son of one of the
chiefest of their enemy family; but because they
knew that our friendship was such (and seldom
or never did we walk asunder) that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for them to engage him, and not endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49502:49"/>
me, and very sensible they were that should
I have miscarried by their swords, my Father
would either by Embassie have procured, or by
war have forced the Grand Duke to have execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a severe vengeance on my murtherers; nor
was the old <hi>Alonzo Schiarra</hi> insensible that it
was out of fear of me, for those reasons before
recited, that his son passed unassaulted, and
therefore he took special care that he walked
not out single, nor indeed in any company but
mine; but he might have spared those thoughts,
for such was the sweet harmony we found in one
anothers society, that all others, except our
selves, seemed a jarring discord; and yet it
happened one morning that I being somewhat
indisposed, and keeping my bed, he accompanied
me in my chamber, till about ten a clock, when I
falling into an easie slumber, led by I know not
what evil Angel, he adventured to go abroad
into the <hi>Piazza;</hi> scarce was he gone but I awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and calling for him, a servant told me that
he was newly gone forth, I started to hear him
say so, for me thought his very words were like
the passing Bell which rang out any friends fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
I leapt out of bed, and put on my cloaths
with a propicious speed, made all haste towards
the <hi>Piazza,</hi> where I found that true which my
fears had boded to me, for just at the corner of
the street that entred upon the place, I espied
him valiantly defending himself against two of
the <hi>Donati,</hi> I flew with all possible speed to the
place, but just as I arrived to his assistance, I had
occasion given me to think that all help of mine
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49502:49"/>
was too late, for brandishing my sword at one of
of them, I had no sooner said, And will the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati</hi>
never forget to be treacherous? but he fell
at my feet, fainting rather through effusion of
blood, then for any dangerous or mortal wound
received; but seeing him fall I stopped my
speech, and desperately ran at one of his Assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants,
whom I made measure out his length on
the earth, to accompany my dear friend, whilest
the other trusted to his feet for his safety, not
need he have ran overswiftly, for my care of
<hi>Schiarra</hi> would not permit me to pursue him:
but coming to my friend, who lay stretched out
upon the ground, I perceived in him very few
symptomes of life yet I thought it more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
to cherish some hopes that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
and by them encourage my self to have
his wounds quickly recommended to the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
care, then delay time by an unprofitable
grief, the onely way utterly to loose him; and
therefore having got the assistance of some Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens
thereabouts, we carried him home in a
chair, the Surgions whom I had sent for, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
us, who after they had laid him with the
greatest ease they could upon the bed, began to
use those arts they thought most fit to return
him to life, which in half an hours time they
effected, and in as much more having dressed
his wounds, assured me, that though they were
very many, there was not one of them mortal,
or dangerous, but that his fainting was onely
for loss of blood, which out of so many Orifices
must needs finde passage in abundance, that if
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49502:50"/>
they could now (which they would use all their
Arts to do) keep him from falling into a feaver,
there could not be the least doubt of his recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and that in very few days. I had no sooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
this comfortable news, but I ran with all
possible speed to communicate it to the good old
<hi>Alonzo,</hi> who overcome with excess of grief, had
retired himself into his closet, and would by no
perswasions either be drawn thence, or restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from tearing his gray hairs and reverent
beard, and miserably afflicting himself; being
come to the door. I knocked at it, and withall
told him, that I had brought him news that
would rejoyce him; And am I then so misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
said he, as to hear <hi>Spinola</hi> tell me now of
rejoycing? Open the door Sir, said I, and if I
do not perform what I have promised, blot me
out of the list of your friends; herewith he
opened the door, and looking stedfastly upon
me, what, says he, my dear <hi>Spinola,</hi> hast thou
now to tell me that can make me rejoyce? now
that I have lost my son, is it that thou wilt be
another <hi>Giorgio</hi> to me? I know thou wilt, and I
accept it, but alas! he was my own son, my
own flesh and blood, give me leave then to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
him; and herewith he began again to tear
his hair and beard, but I stopped his fury, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him, Alas Sir! why should you thus cruciate
your self for a supposed loss? your Son liveth,
and may, I hope, yet live to be as aged as you
are now: Fie, fie <hi>Spinola,</hi> said he, think you to
make believe these are any other then mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?
I could never have believed you so cruel,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49502:50"/>
did I not see him dead? 'Tis true, replied I, he
was both to yours and my appearance dead, but
it was onely loss of blood, which was the cause
of his fainting, for now his spirits being revived,
the Surgions assure me, he will in very few days
be easily recovered, none of his wounds being
either dangerous, or mortal: If this be true,
replied he, how am I blest, and blessed be thou
that bring'st me joyful news indeed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
going to take me about the neck to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
me, joy had so overpowred his soul, that
his spirits failing, he fell into a swound, but soon
recovered, when yet he would not believe what
I had related to him, till his eyes had confirmed
it: to be brief, three weeks time rendred <hi>Schiarra</hi>
by the great care and industry of the Surgions,
perfectly whole, during which time I never stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from him, nor indeed durst I stir abroad, the
whole Family of the <hi>Donati</hi> having solemnly
vowed my death, though they all lost their
lives, for the rescue I gave <hi>Schiarra,</hi> and for the
wounding their Kinsman, for slain he was not,
and now my friend was recovered, we began to
consult our own safeties, for we were both
equally concerned; the opinion of old <hi>Alonze</hi>
was, that I should return to <hi>Geno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>a,</hi> where I
might presume my self secure, and that to my
care he would commit his son, whom he did not
doubt I would preserve as my self, till the
storms in <hi>Florence</hi> were blown over: I returned
him a hearty thanks for the honor he did me in
making such a motion, assuring my self that it
would be seconded by my dear <hi>Schiarra,</hi> whose
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49502:51"/>
friendship and mine had taken so deep root,
that I was very confident nothing but death, or
inevitable necessity could separate us; so all
parties being agreed, we next advised how to
take our journey with all possible privacy, which
to effect all things succeeded to our wish; so
we departed from <hi>Florence,</hi> taking our leaves of
the good old <hi>Alonzo,</hi> who with many tears offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up oraisons for our safety: In four days time
we arrived at <hi>Genoua,</hi> where I used my utmost
endeavors to entertain <hi>Schiarra,</hi> according to
best rules of friendship, recommending him to
those of my relations, whom I knew the greatest
honorers of worth and ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>ue, but he would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
tell me that my company was the onely so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of his soul, which I took care he should not
want, for I protest really that I believe in all
the time which we spent in <hi>Genoua,</hi> which was
near a year, we never were three hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
absent from one another; our sports were
alike, our studies alike, and as yet we had not
been wounded with Loves which might separate
and estrange our affections. About a twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneth,
as I said, being past in the pleasures of
<hi>Genoua</hi> and the <hi>Riviera,</hi> I received Letters from
my Father, commanding me to attend him at
the Leaguer of <hi>Ostend,</hi> that I might there to the
Theory which I had learn'd, add some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the practical part of War; this message
extremly perplexed me, for I was commanded
to attend the messenger in his return, which
was within six days, and doing so, I was fearful
least in that we should not procure license
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49502:51"/>
from old <hi>Alonzo</hi> to permit my <hi>Schiarra</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
me, and though I knew it vvould be
as great a trouble to him to part from me, as for
me to be deprived of him, yet I was confident
without his Fathers license<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to go, much less not stay, should he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it: but hoping I might procure so much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
from <hi>Alonzo</hi> as to permit him to accompany
me in so honorable an enterprize, thinking every
hours delay a years; I communicated my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to <hi>Schiarra,</hi> withall acquainting him with
my resolution to write to his Father, to beg the
leave of his further society; for, said I, my dear
<hi>Schiarra,</hi> I can as well die as part from thee;
He professed the same to me, and added, that
himself too vvould vvrite, and that in such win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
terms, that he should not have the power
to deny him; I rejoyced to hear him say so,
but, said I, what we do, must be done with all
expedition, for within six days must the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
return with an answer of those letters he
brought from my Father to the Senate, vvith
vvhom I am commanded to go: this made him
sensible of the necessity of expedition, so we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
posted away a messenger on purpose,
with order to make all the haste imaginable, whilest
vve in the mean time provided all things for
our journey: but alas! the sixth day was now
come, and our post not yet returned, nor any
news of him, the messenger whom I vvas to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
vvould by no means be perswaded to stay
one minute; in this Agony vve knew not vvhat
to do, or vvhat course to take, at length vve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49502:52"/>
that <hi>Schiarra</hi> should accompany me to
the foot of the <hi>Alps,</hi> and if our Post overtook
him not before that time, or there, without a
concession to go further, that then we should
part, and patiently endure our hard fortune;
so we set forth, but a tedious and melancholy
journey it was, for we in vain every minute
expected what yet came not, three dayes we
journeyed thus, till we came to the Mountains
foot, the place appointed for our taking <hi>congé</hi>
of each other, and so fearful were we that that
adverse lot would certainly befal us, that we
thought the next morning not sufficient to bid
one another adieu, but began as soon as we
came in to our Inne at night to bethink how we
should wean our selves one from another; The
<hi>Illustrissimo,</hi> whom we attended, perceiving our
mutual affection, was highly pleased with it, and
pitied so much our fear'd misfortune, that he,
who at <hi>Genoua</hi> refused to stay a minute, now
proffered to wait a whole day there, in hopes
our Post might in that time arrive, for we had
left order at <hi>Genoua</hi> he should follow us thither,
we equally strove who should first return thanks
for this great favor of this <hi>Illustrissimo's,</hi> who
kindly accepted it, but by out better fortune we
needed not his courtesie, for that night going to
bed with somewhat more alacrity then formerly,
our joys, hopes and fears, kept us still awake,
pouring forth Oraisons for the Posts arrival be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the favorable time of stay granted by the
<hi>Illustrissimo</hi> were expired, when it happened
that whilest we thus busying our selves, we might
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49502:52"/>
at a great distance hear a horn, which seemed to
draw nearer to us; <hi>Schiarra</hi> no longer able to
contain his joy, nor doubting but that it was a
Post sent from <hi>Genoua</hi> with Letters from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
immediately lept out of bed, and in all
haste putting on his night-Gown, ran down
staires to meet the unexpected messenger of his
and my bliss, I followed him with all expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
possibly, and coming down into the road,
found him just examining of the Post, who gave
him an account far beneath his expectations, to
wit, that he was come from <hi>Modena,</hi> and was
bound in all haste to <hi>Turine: Schiarra</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
angry with himself that he had flattered
himself into such mountanious imaginations,

followed, hearing us name our selves, accosted
me, and tells me, Truly Sir, if you had now by
chance named your self I should have despaired
of finding you out, for I had enquired for you
of almost every person in the Inne. And vvhat is
thy business, said I, that thou wert so inquisitive
for me? not dreaming that he had brought such
joyful news. Business, said he, I have brought
you, Sir, a return of your Letters from <hi>Florence.</hi>
From <hi>Florence,</hi> said <hi>Schiarra,</hi> delay not to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Nor by me, said <hi>Schiarra,</hi> vvho must, and do
hold my self as much obliged by it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in it, as your self, for now I enjoy you
in vvhom are all my joys compleated, and
therefore, dear friend, let him accompany us
forward in our journey; I readily assented, and
therewith we thought fit to take some two hours
repose for it; now drew near morning, that vve
might be the better able to travel the next day,
vvhen vve set forth vvith more joy and content
then vve had done at any time formerly. To
recount unto you the particulars of our journey,
vvill be too prolix, it vvill suffice to say, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49502:53"/>
it vvas prosperous, and that in six vveeks time
from our departure from <hi>Genoua,</hi> we arrived in
the Camp before <hi>Ostend;</hi> here I endeavored to
have my Father receive my dear <hi>Schiarra,</hi> vvith
the same affection that old <hi>Alonzo</hi> had shewed
me, nor vvas he at all backward in performing
my desires, striving rather to exceed my self in
kindness: having passed the first complements
of entertainment, we vvent to view the Leaguer,
vvhich had now lain two years before that
Town, or rather before some mounts of earth,
for upon vvhat vvas at first the Town, our Camp
vvas Pitch, and y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>t a Town held out against
us; but I am now dear friend, come to give a
relation of those things in vvhich your self, as
vvell as I, have been an actor, I shall therefore
omit all passages of that War, as to you tedious
and superfluous, and onely tell you, that <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arra</hi>
did there things vvorthy himself and his
family, and deserving my Fathers greatest
friendship and affection, vvho rejoyced that I
had made choice of so Noble and Gallant an
Associate; we staid together in the <hi>Netherlands</hi>
for some years, after the surrendring of that once
thought invincible Town of <hi>Ostend,</hi> improving
our selves as well as vve could in the practice
and policy of Arms, in both vvhich, blushing I
speak it, <hi>Schiarra</hi> so far exceeded me, that were
it not to do my friend right, I should shame to
acknowledge it. Your modesty 'tis Sir, said
Captain <hi>Goodlake</hi> interrupting him, that thus
extenuates your own deserts, and your genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
that amplifies the merits of your friends,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49502:54"/>
vvhich how great soever, give me leave to think
that they could not exceed yours. Platter me
not so, said <hi>Spinola,</hi> for of all men breathing
you have least occasion; But, continued he,
my Father at length thought fit I should return
home, as being arrived at an age fit for Loves,
and the care he had to see children spring from
the loyns of me his onely son, made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
unto me several Ladies of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouese</hi>
Nobility, out of vvhom he enjoyned me
to take a vvife, yet vvith all telling me, that
he would not limit my fancy absolutely to those,
but leave me to choose vvhere I pleased always,
provided that I stained not my birth or honor by
too inferior a match: so <hi>Schiarra</hi> he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
my sister a Lady (as your eyes have
been vvitness) of no despisable beauty, assuring
him that he should be happy if their affections
could meet vvith these instructions; vve took
our leaves, and arriving at <hi>Genoua,</hi> dedicated
our selves to the Courtship of Ladies; for my
own part, I confess, I found in my self little
propensity to marry, yet I observed that <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arra</hi>
seemed to bear a kinde of affection to my
sister, yet not so violent a one as I found after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards
she bore him, for his was not so fixt as
appeared afterwards, but that it could stray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay
to the Love of another Lady, as it did
by the strangest accident that you have ever
heard, to one, I must confess, of an excelling
beauty, and no way inferior to my sister <hi>Isabella</hi>
in Nobility of birth, or riches; it chanced one
day that walking on the banks of the <hi>Riviera,</hi>
                              <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49502:54"/>
where the Nobility of the City use to solace
themselves in the cool of the evening in their
Coaches, that <hi>Schiarra</hi> mistaking a Coach, which
he thought to belong to one of our peculiar
friends, sifted up the curtain, but seeing his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
he craved pardon for his unwilling of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
which he thought had been granted, but
such was the rage of the Gentleman, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
onely with one Lady was in it, that
though at present the expressed not his disgust,
yet he awaited his revenge, which my forced
departure into the City about some urgent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
gave him the better opportunity of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for having traced careless <hi>Schiarra</hi> into a
private walk, he very rudely conjures him to
draw; <hi>Schiarra</hi> was so amazed that he could
not at first finde any answer, but that he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Gentleman was mistaken: But the other
with a kinde of Spanish <hi>Bravado,</hi> answers, that
he should finde his eyes had found out their true
object, and that if he refused to draw, he
would send his coward soul to hell. Sir, replied
<hi>Schiarra,</hi> you seem to be noble, and by your
garb should be at least a Gentleman, but you
must give me leave to admire your judgement,
that so rashly seeks a quarrel with me, who I
am confident never injured you, nor to my
knowledge ever saw you before, but let me
but know the reasons induce you to it, and
you shall quickly finde I am no coward; all the
reason in the world could produce no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
from the furious Gentleman, then that he
had offered him an affront, which he was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49502:55"/>
to revenge, and therefore advised him to
draw, otherwise his sword should force him;
well answered <hi>Schiarra,</hi> since I must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
make trial of your valor, I shall endeavor
to make you repent it; and therewithall draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his sword, they made two passes in v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

immediately fell; now Sir, said <hi>Schiarra,</hi> you
will be pleased to give me a reason why you
were so desperately and rashly valiant? Scarce
had he ended those words, when he might hear
the cries of some Lady, piercing his ears, and
looking about, might perceive one running to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, and crying, Oh! for pity sake save
my dear <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s life, or if nothing but blood
can satisfie your fury, sacrifice mine in stead of
his to your victorious arm; such was the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the gallant <hi>Schiarra</hi> at the sight of her,
and so much were his sences captivated at the
excelling beauties of her face, and harmony of
her voice, that not able to return an answer, he
stood leaning on his sword, as if her looks had
the power of <hi>Medusas</hi> to turn men into Statues.
The Virgin still anxious for her friend, and
fearing lest if her request were not granted
soon, it would be for ever too late, falling down
on her knees, and embracing him, began in a
Language which would have charm'd Adders to
sue for the saving of his life; Do not noble Sir,
said she, let the tears and prayers of an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Virgin, who never sued before, be now
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49502:55"/>
spent in vain, but redeem the dear forfeit of
my brothers life, or if you yet be so cruel that
nothing but gore can cancel your anger, here,
here sheath your bright weapon between these
white breasts, this blood may sooner quench
your ireful heat! let me die, so he may
live! with these words the tears so fast trukled
down upon her Rosie Cheeks, that it would have
made the fiercest <hi>Scythian</hi> relent and turn pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
but <hi>Schiarra</hi> still stood mute, as if her
sweet voice had rather been thunder, and struck
him dumb, till at length recollecting himself,
he endeavored to raise her from the ground;
but she refused to rise, crying, Oh! no Sir, here
will I for ever lie prostrate, till you confirm my
boon, and grant <hi>Lorenzo</hi> life; to which <hi>Schiarra</hi>
seeing she would not rise, kneeling likewise
down; replied, Goddess, for so your celestial
beauty, and Angelical voice confirm, yea, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
my inconsiderate rudeness (the childe of
my astonishment to look upon so divine a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence)
that hath permitted you to kneel and
beg that which you may command. I am no
Goddess, replied she, but a hapless Virgin, who
here lie prostrate for my brothers life. How rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Madam, answered <hi>Schiarra,</hi> would I grant
your boon, but that I fear by it I shall be too
soon exiled from the blessing your presence so
fully affords me. Will you not then let him
live? replied she: Yes Madam, said he, he
must live since you command it, and happy,
thrice happy 'tis being vanquished to have so
fair a saver; would Heaven had made his sword
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49502:56"/>
my Conqueror, so I might then have deserved
so divine a pity; Rise Madam, rise, and receive
your brother, but let me now beg one boon of
you to know vvhat made him my enemy? It was,
said she, your lifting up the curtains of our
Coach, which though you excused, he in heat
of blood pursued you to seek revenge. 'Twas
a mistake Madam answered <hi>Schiarra,</hi> that made
me so discourteous, which I will yet redeem
with my life when ever you shall please to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it. 'Tis too great a forfeit Sir, answered
she, for so slight an offence, let me now onely
beg your help to lift my brother into the Coach,
which <hi>Schiarra</hi> readily assented to, though with
an inward unwillingness, because he should
thereby be deprived of the sight of his Saint:
Scarce had he done it, and the Coach departed,
but I arrived at the place where this accident
had happened, and found <hi>Schiarra</hi> in the same
posture which I represented him in at the first
sight of the Lady, having on his drawn sword,
and fixing his eyes upon the ground, with a
countenance sufficiently demonstrating some
strange and unusual melancholy had possest him,
I wondred to see him stand in that maner, and
fearing lest my absence might have endangered
him I ran to him, and pulling him by the arm,
demanded if he had been assaulted by thieves?
He was no less startled at his surprize, then I was
to se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> him in these dumps, and had not his eye
been quicker then his hand, he had assuredly
sheathed his sword in my bosome, but seeing it
was I who had disturbed his serious thoughts:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49502:56"/>
Yes my dear <hi>Spinala,</hi> said he, I have met with
one who hath robb'd me of one of my choisest
Jewels, I am undone, for ever lost. Fie, said I,
this is passion, fancy not to your self a misery
when none attends you, what is it thou hast lost?
Lost, replied he, I have lost my self, but what
is more I have lost you: Me, said I, Hell it self
is not capable of robbing me of so high priz'd a
friendship, dear friend dally not thus with me.
Alas! Alas! said he, Heaven knows I da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ly
not, and that you may know I am serious too,
here take my sword, and sacrifice me to your
just revenge. I must be sensible of an injury
first, said I, for I am confident none but your
self can accuse you. True, said he, none but my
self and this treacherous heart of mine can be
witness against me, I have forfeited all those
Obligations of friendship, in which you have
bound me, these traitorous eyes of mine have
ruined me. Prethee how, said I, undeceive thy
self, this cannot be other then a delusion. Would
to Heaven, said he, it were so, but let me tell
you plainly, and then I am confident you will
your self, without my intreaty, be ready to take
my sword and make me a just victime to the
wrong I have done you. Alas! said I, my dear
<hi>Schiarra,</hi> what can it be that can make thee
thus to fancy thou hast wronged me? thy soul
can never contract a guilt so great but I shall be
as ready to pardon it as you have been slow in
delivering it. Talk not of pardon, said he, for in
confidence that you will revenge it with my
blood, I will impart it. 'Tis this assume 'tis this,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49502:57"/>
all those shows of Love which I have made to
your virtuous Sister are vanished into Air, that
bond which should have bound fast our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
to eternity, is broken, utterly broken, for
I now pay my devotions to another Saint. He
could not have invented a greater affliction to
me then these words were, I started and stood
as amazed as I found him at first. I considered
the passionate affection which my Sister but few
days before expressed to me she bore him, and
above that the great dishonor would be done
to our Family should she be thus slighted, but
above all how ill my Father would comport such
an affront to have his daughter refused, because
proffered by him, that in a rage snatching his
offered sword from his willing hand; Do but,
said I, again confirm this disloyalty, and you
shall not need to beg me your Executioner. By
the hopes I have, answered he, that you will
take a just revenge upon me, all that I have
told you is true, my heart is stollen by another.
And canst thou perfidious man, said I, then leave
my sister languishing, whom thou hast betrayed
into so ardent an affection of thee, here take
thy sword and defend thy self. I will receive it,
said he, not to make resistance, but in assurance
that it will provoke you to make me fall by
yours, strike then, and let out this treacherous
blood. I could willingly, I confess, have made
him an oblation to my poor Sisters Love, and
the honor of our Family, but the sacred name
of friend so often vow'd between us, begat a
palsie in my blood, and withheld my arm, so
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49502:57"/>
turning from him: no false man, said I, I'le not
become thy butcher, Heaven shall work thy
ruine, for be assured, who ever thou now makest
thy Spouse, will proove a faithless Strumpet;
At these words I was going away, but he called
after me, crying, thou liest, return, I'le now
fight not in my own defence, but hers whom I
adore, for know she whom I now love is one
whom thou oughtst not mention unless with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
on thy knees, one whose heavenly
looks would tempt a Hermit, who had spent his
whole life in contemplation, nay, for whom
Angels would desert their bliss, and count it a
greater happiness then Heaven to enjoy her; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
for wert thou arm'd with thunder, this
sword should reach thee. These words gave me
assurance that he was irrevocably lost, I began
to consider that more sisters I had, more friends
so worthy were not to be found, and therefore
returning to him, come Sir, said I, sheath your
sword, and know I pity you, and if my service
can assist you in gaining your new love, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
it. Alas! my dear <hi>Spinola,</hi> said he, this
is worse then killing me, to tantalize me thus,
for I know thou canst not so much wrong thy self
and sister. I do think, replied I, you have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
found me faithless, by all the Gods, by all
our vow'd friendship, not all my sisters wrongs,
shall make me prove disloyal to you, let me
then know who is now thy Mistris, that I may
assist thee in obtaining her. Am I then, said he,
yet so happy in my misery? Talk not, said I, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of misery, for thou shalt be fully happy, if
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49502:58"/>
all my skill and power can effect it, let me first
know your Saint. Alas! said he, that's my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
that I know her not, yet 'tis she that was in
the Coach we this day overtook: 'tis then, said
he, the fair <hi>Florelia,</hi> daughter to the Marquesse
of <hi>Senazzaro,</hi> so fam'd for beauty over all the
<hi>Genouese</hi> Territories. Be comforted dear friend,
said I, for my acquaintance with <hi>Gilberto,</hi> Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to <hi>Sanazzaro,</hi> shall easily procure your
admittance, come and you shall easily perceive
how zealous I will be in thy service. Heaven,
answered he, be propitious to our designs, and
so coming along we soon reached the City, and
at the gates parted, he taking the way to our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and I to that of the Marquesse <hi>Sanaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaro,</hi>
where meeting with <hi>Gilberto,</hi> I disclosed
unto him <hi>Schiarra</hi>'s Loves to <hi>Florelia,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
that he would invent some way to gain
him admittance to her; he at first was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
backward to attempt any thing, alledging
that therein he should betray his Master, and
likewise abuse my friend, by feeding those
hopes which would prove but vain, she being
already promised by her Father to one with
whom he will not break, and therefore, says he,
noble <hi>Spinola,</hi> urge me no farther in it. I knew
'twas gold that must make him relent, and
therefore giving him a pretty quantity, and
promising more, he began to mollifie, and to
tell me, that the person whom her father had
allotted for her husband was by her violently
hated, yet such was the perverseness of the old
Marquesse, that he had resolutely determined
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49502:58"/>
to force her to marry him, and that very spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
so that there was now no way left for to
remove him, but the death of him he had chosen
for her Spouse. Do but name him, said I, and
assure your self he is seal'd for dead. 'Tis, said
he, <hi>Petruchio<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                              </hi> eldest son and heir to the <hi>Count de
Ligue;</hi> in the mean time do you and your
friend come to morrow night with some Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
to her chamber window, and doubt not of
gentle audience.</p>
                           <p>I returned to my friend with joy, to have
effected thus much, who embracing me, and
calling me the Author of his happiness, told me,
that he had likewise discovered somewhat which
would not displease me. What is it, said I,
Prythee? why, says he, no sooner was I come
home, but <hi>Catharina</hi> your sister <hi>Isabellas</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
calling me aside, began to tell me very
seriously, that she was sorry she must be messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of such ill news, desiring me to arm my self
with a noble patience, and not let passion grow
predommant at the hearing it. I began to muse
what it should be, and feared nothing more then
that thy sister <hi>Isabella</hi> having discovered my
falshood, had chalked out some path for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
but those fears were soon dissipated, by
the maids telling me, almost with tears in her
eyes, that <hi>Isabella</hi> had forgot all her loves to
me, and now doted on the <hi>Lorenso</hi> son to the
Marquis of <hi>Sannazzaro,</hi> whom she had onely
espied out of a window carrying in a chair to be
dressed of a wound he then seemed to have
newly received. I easily (said <hi>Schiarra)</hi> guessed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49502:59"/>
it to be the person whose life my <hi>Florelia</hi> had
begged, and so was I rejoyced at the news that
I could hardly feign to her to be troubled, which
I thought fit to do. You did well, said I, to do
so, but you must now think of going to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
your Mistris, which he accorded to, and we
having soon provided our selves of Musicians,
addressed our selves through the Postern, which
<hi>Gilberto</hi> had of purpose left open for us, to <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nazzaro</hi>'s
garden, and placing our selves under
<hi>Florelias</hi> window, after the Musick had a while
played, <hi>Schiarra</hi> caused his boy to sing this
song, which he had of purpose composed:

                           <p>Scarce had he ended the first <hi>Stanza</hi> when we
might hear the window open, and <hi>Florelia</hi> and
her maid discoursing with a seeming wonder
who it should be that at that time of the night
had bestowed that Musick on them; the maid
guessing it to be <hi>Petruchio,</hi> whose impertinency
she discoursed on, and aptly discovered to us
the hate his Mistris bore him: but the Song be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ended <hi>Florelia</hi> her self demanded who it
was, that when night had with its sable mantel
beclouded the world, durst there adventure with
so much danger on her secrets? It is one, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Schiarra,</hi> whom you (when for your sake he
saved your brothers life) promised so much to
honor as to keep in memory. If you be he, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<hi>Florelia,</hi> I confess I am obliged to honor
your Nobleness, but you must excuse me if at
these untimely hours I dare admit no confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
your Musick Sir, I thank you for, and so
much do I love you that I would not endanger
you, for if you should be seen here, your life
would run a hazard, therefore farewel: here
she was about to shut the window, when <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arra</hi>
with a passionate voice cried out, for Loves
sake, stay <hi>Madam,</hi> for were there here dangers
as thick as there are Stars above us, nay were
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49502:60"/>
even death it self, here I would scorn his fury,
and believe that whilest you stay, I am by your
presence made immortal. I am content, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
she, lest you should condemn me of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courtesie
to stay, but you must then be brief
in telling me what you desire. Oh! Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Schiarra,</hi> confine me not to such hard
terms, and yet why should I crave greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense
since all I wist for is summed in these few
words, Madam, I love you, and desire your
love. And is that all, said she, then Sir farewel,
and herewith she made a second proffer to shut
the window, and had done it, had not <hi>Schiarra</hi>
withheld her by crying; Oh Madam! let me
conjure by the blood, which yet for your sake
flows in your brothers veins, to stay and hear me
further. That charmes me for some time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
she, but consider, I pray, both your dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and mine, and therefore conclude with
speed. Know then Lady, continued <hi>Schiarra,</hi>
that my zeal could tell you, that you are above
expression fair, that your eyes illuminate the
night, and Eclipse the Stars in their greatest
brightness, that you are the Master-piece of
Nature, in which she strove to wed Art and
Beauty together, but these terms though they
want nothing of truth, yet are onely fit to be
used by those whose loves lie in their lips, my
deeds shall speak the truth and constancy of my
love. Should all the actions in the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
your love, answered <hi>Florelia,</hi> I must still
return you the same answer that I dare not,
cannot love you, for my more honest thoughts
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49502:60"/>
permit me not to deride your passions with fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
species, or flatter them with vain hopes,
but as you have been brief in your desires, I
will be the same in my denial; in confidence
of the truth of which, I desire you to rest satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and assure your self, that whilest you persist
farther in it, you do but plough the seas, and
write in the sand. You are noble, answered
<hi>Schiarra,</hi> thus to rid me of my torment, and
not permit me languishing to burn in those hot
tortures, behold this blade, which once for your
sake did refrain from shedding your dear bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
blood, shall now make me a victime to
your cruelty, and here-withall he was about to
have sheathed his sword in his bosom, and had
done it, had not I who stood hard by perceiving
his intent, ran to him and stayed his arm, which
<hi>Florelia</hi> perceiving, Fie, said she, what a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
soldier are you thus to despair at the
first repulse, grant that I could affect you, would
you not account me light should I at the first
assault be won, before I had made any experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of your faith and loyalty; nor can I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
my fathers consent adventure to love any,
get that, and you may perchance finde heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room
in my breast. Me thinks those words, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Schiarra,</hi> return me to a new life, me
thinks the enamoured Stars hangs o're thy lips,
expecting a blessing from them. Be not too hasty
Sir, said <hi>Florelia,</hi> for it is yet impossible I should
love you, being already contracted. And yet 'tis
in your power, replied he, to love your servant.
Well, said she, I can hold out no longer, and if
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49502:61"/>
what Anatomists write, that in the Center of our
hearts, there is a little concave where resides
our best affections, be true, then is your Augury
a divine truth, for all the love lies therein en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
to the worth of another, not to the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loufie
of him to whom my father hath contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me. May I be so happy Madam, said <hi>Schi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arra,</hi>
as to receive from your sweet lips the name
of the person whom you are pleased to make so
blessed? Know then Sir, said she, for I can no
longer conceal it, but let the night yet shroud
me with a blacker cloud, to hide from you the
blushes of my face, that from the first time I
saw you, and observed the nobleness of your
temper, in saving my brothers life, which he
had rashly forfeited to your just revenge, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a true devotarist to those vertues which to
me seem'd heavenly: Here she made a small
stop, expecting that <hi>Schiarra</hi> should return some
answer, but into such an extasie had his joy trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
him, that he was not so sensible of his
happiness as to return a due thanks for it, when
his silence gave <hi>Florelia</hi> occasion to continue
thus; I fear Sir, my to soon yielding to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
has abated, or utterly extinguished that
love you but now zealously protested to bear
me, but if it have, I can but blame my own cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity;
farther she would have proceeded, when
<hi>Schiarra</hi> recollecting himself, interrupted her by
crying out; Oh! Madam, do not believe my
silence to proceed from any other cause then
the exuberance of my joy, your words have
ravisht me beyond my hopes, and made my
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49502:61"/>
heart too narrow to contain that bliss, which now
you have made it entertainer of. Then Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
she, excuse my jealous mistake, and if
you please walk round about the house, my maid
shall attend to give you entrance. I will flie to
such happiness Madam, said he, and therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
we were just going, according to her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
when betrayed by that perfidious villain
<hi>Gilberto,</hi> we were encountred by <hi>Petruchio,</hi> the
contracted Lover of <hi>Florelia,</hi> I was the formost,
and therefore the first that met him, murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to himself in such terms as I easily guessed,
that he had overheard all their discourse, yet had
I carelesly passed by him, had he not bid me
stand, and withall told me, that he had an arm
Heaven it self would not let falter in revenge
of such impious injuries; what art thou, said I,
that after thou hast made a forfeit of thy life by
over-hearing our secrets, darest thus rashly
tempt thy death, be gone, be gone, and bless
that fate that spare thee. Be gone, said he, were
you encompassed with whole Legions, this single
sword would dare to encounter them, and force
a way to my revenge. Your very valiant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
I, or else some strange and unknown de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
frenzy has seiz'd you, retire Sir, or tell
what 'tis hath prompted you to this madness.
You shall finde 'tis not madness but justice,
said he, which of you two is it that dates attempt
to court my <hi>Florelia,</hi> mine I call her, since
both her self and father have confirm'd her so.
Dare Sir, replied <hi>Schiarra,</hi> 'tis I dare dot, and
will, what darest thou do to oppose it? I dare
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49502:62"/>
Sir revenge it, said he, but first I'le tell that
wrong you do both heaven and me, in striving
to deprive me of my betrothed Spouse, she is
mine, nor can she while I live be any others.
This sword shall clear my passage to her, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Schiarra,</hi> and since you must have a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris,
I'le send you to choose one amongst the
Infernal deities. Dear friend, said he, turning
to me, put up your sword, this glorious quarrel
doth concern none but my self; come Sir draw,
(again to <hi>Petruchio)</hi> and let our weapons decide
whose she must be. Stay Sir a little, said <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truchio,</hi>
you seem a person well qualified, and
let me with your badness of your cause chill that
blood which flows so violently in your veins,
consider that with your blood you strive to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
her from me, who both by her self and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath been confirmed mine, before whole
quires of Saints and blessed Angels; let not
your lust then blinde you to run head-long to a
sin so horrid and abominable. Oh! Sir, consider,
and hazard not your souls salvation on a quarrel
so unjust, should it be my fate, as in justice it
must be, to kill thee, consider what a masse of
endless woe (hast thou no other sins to charge
thy conscience with) thou pluckst upon thy head,
sure this must cause an earthquake in thy blood.
I am no School-boy, replied <hi>Schiarra,</hi> to be thus
Catechized, words are to weak to force me
from the love of the Beautous <hi>Florelia,</hi> if you
will enjoy her you must fight for her, which
with what reason you can do, when you know
that after your sword has gained her from me,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49502:62"/>
you must likewise force that will which cannot
love you; come Sir prepare your self, or resolve
Lamb-like to die her sacrifice. Since you are so
resolute, replied <hi>Petruchio,</hi> this sword shall
quickly finde your heart, and therewith draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made a sudden thrust at <hi>Schiarra,</hi> who as
nimbly avoided it, and with the point of his
weapon found a smooth way to his enemies
heart, who without speaking a word fell down
and died, and <hi>Schiarra</hi> glad that it was done
with so little noise, and I proceeded to finde
our entrance into the house, at the back door of
which we found <hi>Florelias</hi> maid attending, who
joyfully received <hi>Schiarra,</hi> and both desired me
to walk to my Palace, the maid assuring me that
my friend need fear no danger; I left them,
but my soul boding some further evil, I could
not depart, but resolved to watch my <hi>Schiarra</hi>'s
coming out till the morning, but before that
approached, I might hear a bustle in the house,
and espie one fetching a dangerous leap out of
a window, which I supposed to be <hi>Florelias;</hi> I
ran towards the place with all speed possible,
where I found <hi>Schiarra</hi> set upon disarmed, and
almost naked as he was, by a villain, whose per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
the darkness of the night hindred me from
discovering, but obstructed me not from taking
a just revenge of depriving him of life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuing
my friend, who all breathless as he was,
desired me to assist him to make the quickest
escape we could towards our Palace; I second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his desires, and wondring at what should be
the occasion of this Tragical event, should scarce
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49502:63"/>
have contained my desires of knowing it, till we
came home, had not my fear of being too close
pursued and surprized, witheld me, but being
come home, I was earnest with <hi>Schiarra</hi> to know
the maner and cause of his fright, but all he
could tell me was, that when he was close clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
in the embraces of the beautous <hi>Florelia,</hi>
her father, by whom informed of his being there
he knew not, he came into the chamber, and
had there sacrificed his life to his rage and fury,
had not the window by chance been open, out
of which he leaped, and had there again been
slaughtered, had not I come into his rescue. I
was amazed at what he told me, and began now
to imagine that <hi>Gilberto</hi> had betrayed us, and
was fearful lest in the morning we should be
pursued for <hi>Petruchio's,</hi> and the others death;
but those doubts were soon over by the general
report of the accident spread about the City,
that old <hi>Sanazzaro,</hi> finding his daughters incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency,
had in rage murdered her, that <hi>Petru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio</hi>
her betrothed Spouse was found dead in the
garden, and the Marquesses Steward <hi>Gilberto</hi>
slain under <hi>Florelias</hi> window, that there was no
means left to finde out the causers of this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,
but by some cloths and a sword which was
left in the chamber, and supposed to be his who
had robb'd <hi>Florelia</hi> of her honor; these reports
confirmed unto us <hi>Gilberto</hi>'s treachery, yet we
were glad he could now no farther betray us, but
above measure was <hi>Schiarra</hi> afflicted for <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relias</hi>
murder, whom I endeavoured to comfort
as well as I could, and further advised to depart
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49502:63"/>
with all speed, for though it should not be found
out that those clothes were his, yet should any
of <hi>Sannazzaro</hi>'s kindred but entertain the least
suspition of him; they would watch some oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to take away his life; he liked my advice,
and his quarrel between the Dukes of the
<hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Mantua</hi> being then breaking forth,
upon my assurance that our State would assist
the <hi>Mantouse,</hi> and that my self would come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in person, he choose to go to <hi>Mantua,</hi> and
attend my coming, during which time how he
joyned himself with the Dukes forces, and how
unfortunately he fell, you have too lately heard.</p>
                           <p>Captain <hi>Goodlake</hi> was extreamly affected with
this Tragick-History of young <hi>Schiarra,</hi> which so
delighted him, that though the night was well
past, he could have wish'd it had continued till
morning, but being ended, these two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
friends addressed themselves to their sleep,
but their troubled thoughts not permitting them
to take any quiet rest, as it were by one consent,

                           <p>THe boysterous <hi>Savoyards</hi> said <hi>Goodlake,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
me in the midst of the Relation of
Mr. <hi>Forcett,</hi> made me of the Comportment of
this vertuous Maid, during the absence of her
Lover, that amongst the number of her Suitors
she had turned away some, whose birth and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
of persons might seem to bear equal bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
with her beloved <hi>Spencers,</hi> which yet could
not batter her well-fixt Constancy, but that it
still flood as firm as a Rock in the midst of the
boysterous waves: But amongst the rest, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
he, two Suitors there were, out of whose
ridiculous humors she made her self sport, the
one son to the Mayor of the Town where she
lived, clownish in every thing, yet forced by
his father to make address unto her, the old man
hoping that by his power in the Town, he might
gain her for his son; to tell you (said <hi>Forcett)</hi>
the antick postures in which both the old man
and his son courted this fair Virgin, the great
proffers, and many invitations they made, would
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49502:64"/>
seem but tiresom, I shall therefore omit them
and proceed to the other; who having usurped
the Name of Captain, though never guilty of
the least valor, or daring to look an enemy in
the face, did think by his <hi>Rhodomontado</hi> terms
rather to force than win affection, so that in the
end he became a continual plague and vexation
to her; neither her self nor any of her house
being able to rest at quiet, or be free from his
boysterous rudeness; her servants he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
as his own, and with a kinde of an imperious
boldness would assault her, as if his bellowing
words like so many Cannons, were sufficient to
batter the fortress of Faith. Thus was he for a
good while her continual trouble, which she bore
with patience, till at length she found out such
a way to curb his domineering rudeness, as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
demonstrated her of a high and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
spirit, far above her birth; often had
she complained to me (said <hi>Forcett)</hi> of the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of this boysterous Captain, but I was as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
as her self how to remedy it, much less
could have invented such a course as she her self
one day imparted to me she resolved to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
which seemed indeed at first so strange,
that I stood amazed at the very mention of it,
as I believe you will be when you hear every
particular: It was briefly, calling me one time
after she had just before been vexed with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchedness,
she began to tell me that I could
not but be sensible how grievous it was to her, to
see her self controuled, her servants beaten, and
her whole house commanded by a ranting fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49502:65"/>
who having learned some high-flown spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
thought he might with them domineer over
the world, that for her part she could no longer
endure it, and therefore had bethought her self
of a remedy, which if I would assist her to effect,
and promise to be secret in, she would put in
execution: I told her I should be ready faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to perform whatsoever she pleased, and
that I was honored she would so far intrust me:
Then know, continued she, that I cannot believe
that this Bumbast Captain is any thing but an
empty vessel, that all his boasts and Rhodomon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tado's
of valor, are nothing but an empty and
airy sound, and he as destitute of valor as he is
of good manners, I have therefore resolved to
make tryal of him; and if you will but furnish
me with Clothes and a Sword, attired like a
yong Gentleman, make an attempt of his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
I could not imagine what answer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to such a strange proposition; but are you
serious indeed, said I? Serious, said she, if you
doubt it, I will trouble you no further, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
this courtesie of some one else. Nay, said
I, if you be resolute, I shall assist you what lies
in my power: but had you not better let me do
this, than hazard your self? suppose he should
fight, what resistance is your tender arm able to
make? Fear not, said she, I cannot in the least
suspect he will dare to oppose me, but if he do
you shall see I will not yield basely. I laughed
heartily (said <hi>Forcet)</hi> to hear her so confident,
and promis'd her to furnish her out at all points;
but then, said he, how will you do to meet him
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49502:65"/>
out of town? It must be your care, answered
she, to train him forth: I concluded, said he, it
should, and having appointed the place whither
I would bring him, and to which I might have a
fair excuse for; having over night furnished this
Amazonian Maid with all necessaries, I easily
perswaded him to walk next morning to the
place destined for his disgrace; he all the way
we walked chanting to me in a sublimated tone
his almost unexpressible valors, and wishing that
we might meet with some. <hi>Hector</hi> that durst af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
us, that I might bear witness of his coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
spirit. I sooth'd his humor, and taking leave
of him at the place appointed, which was a style
that led a-cross a large field, I pretending that
I would onely call at a house which stood on this
side the hedge, and at the further corner of the
field, and promising him to meet him on the
other side; no sooner was I gone over, but I
perceived that by reason of the thickness of the
hedge, he could not discern whether I took the
way I promised or no, I clapt my self down
close to the ground, looking through to behold
the period of this Heroick Adventure, when
scarce had the Redoubled <hi>Lance-prizado</hi> passed
thirty yards from the hedge, but he was met by
this Magnanimous <hi>Virago,</hi> clad like a spruce
yong Gallant, who boldly jostled him, so that she
almost overthrew him, yet though he tottered
two or three yards out of the way, yet his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
was not at all shaken, for without grumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or seeming offended at his Affront, he
courteously saluted our <hi>Amazon,</hi> and would
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49502:66"/>
have passed away, had not she now resolved to
prosecute her intended revenge upon him to the
height, and therefore following him, demanded
vvith an angry countenance, wherefore he had
jostled her? To which my roaring Captain very
submissively replied, Indeed noble Sir, I hope
you will be pleased to excuse me, for I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no harm, but you were pleased to thrust your
poor servant out of the vvay. Villain thou liest,
cries this manly Maid, and therefore vvith thy
sword either give me satisfaction for my abuse,
or here I vow to lay thee dead, why dost not
draw? Hold, let me intreat you, hold, as you
are a Gentleman, replied the <hi>Rhodomontado,</hi> for
I have made a solemn Oath that I vvill not this
day draw my sword against any. No, said she,
thou hast taken the lie already, vvill not that
provoke thee, I'le try if this will do, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvithall
gave him a full box on the ear. You
may this day noble Sir, replied he, do vvhat you
vvill vvith me, for I have solemnly resolved
that I vvill not break my Oath. Villain thou
liest, thou hast made no Oath, said she, 'tis Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvardice,
meer Cowardice vvithholds thee,
not Oaths, base Catife; why art not thou <hi>Rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
that furious <hi>Ajax,</hi> vvhom no day doth pass
but you either vvound, or kill, pray how comes
this out of your Calender? Who I noble Sir,
said he, I kill or wound? Alas! I never drew
this sword in anger, unless it vvere on some
poor vveak fellow that never durst wear steel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him. And darest thou villain then, said
she, dishonor all noble soldiers by vvearing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49502:66"/>
that sword thou darest not use, deliver it me,
or by Heaven I'le send thy Coward soul to
<hi>Pluto.</hi> I could hardly, said <hi>Forcett,</hi> forbear
laughing so loud that they might hear me, to see
vvith vvhat a milde temper that man, vvho in a
Tavern vvould Thunder as if he had been able
to incounter half the vvorld, now delivered up
his sword to a vvoman, and vvith humility sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to permit her to tread over him; vvhilest
I seeing the bufiness to have so happily suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
made haste to meet him at the other
side of the field, vvhere I, making haste, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
just as he came there, and before I could
speak to him, began in a thundring tone to tell
me, that just as he had prophesied, so it fell out,
for he vvas scarce parted twenty steps from me,
but he vvas encountred by one vvhose valor
did as far exceed the <hi>Trojan Hectors,</hi> or <hi>Graecian
Achilles</hi>'s, as their did <hi>Dametas</hi> and <hi>Climas</hi>'s.
You tell me, said I, of a miracle, but of vvhat
stature and years might this <hi>Hero</hi> be? I must
confess, replied he, that he vvas of no gigantick
proportion, nor did I believe count more then
the sixth part of long-lived <hi>Nestors</hi> days, but
for the agility of his body, strength, and nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of his arm, he exceeded all those mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Giants, talk't of to be slain by <hi>George</hi>
a horseback, <hi>Bevis</hi> of <hi>Southampton,</hi> or <hi>Guy</hi> of

applauded his insuperable valor, as I termed it;
nor did he vvant to give me occasion to do so,
by ravelling up actions which he thought he had
inforced me into a belief of, far beyond all the
labors of <hi>Hercules.</hi> But that, continued he,
which gave most occasion of pleasure in this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
vvas his desire that I vvould go vvith
him to <hi>Besse Bridges</hi> her house, vvhom as he
told me, he vvould acquaint vvith this his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
combat; I easily consented to go with him,
because I knew that there vve should soon
make him sensible of his shame; being arrived
there, he began to pursue his accustomed domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering
fashion over her servants, and vvithall
commanded her presence, and she being come,
began to relate to her his adventure in such
thunder-thumping vvords, that the furious bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
between the <hi>Centaures</hi> and <hi>Lapithites,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
not more horror then he expressed this
vvith: Had you, said he, seen two tilling <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors</hi>
justle in the middle Region, you vvould
have made it an apt simile to that force and fury
vvith vvhich vve encountred; <hi>Briarius</hi>'s self with
his hundred Giant hands, could not have dealt
blows thicker, and more fierce, then this brave
<hi>Trojan,</hi> yet vvere they all by the force of this
invincible arm, able to repel thunder-bolts, put
by, and on his head redoubled. Alas! said this
Magnanimous Maid, I fear me this too much

the law, if it have not already, I tremble to
think what became of your enemy. You may
tremble, said he, to think of the fury of our
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49502:67"/>
fight, but I so hackt and hewed him, that if he
be not past all fear and trembling, I'le never
more put trust in this good sword. But if he be
in such danger, replied she, why flie you not, and
so escape the clutches of the Law? The Law,
said he, I fear it not, for I vvas once told by a
Conjurer I should never die for murder. He
knew thy constitution very well, replied she,
that told thee so, and I dare believe her; come
hither Bragadochio, and tell me, was not this
Gyant with whom thou didst encounter a youth,
and of my pitch? Deny it if thou darest, or if
thou hast the impudence to do it; see here, is
not this the Sute he wore? this is the very shooe

contain my self and not burst into laughter, to
see how gallantly she carried this Affair, whilest
our high-flown Rhodomontado in as low a stile

said was true, begging of her not to make his

replied he, and kindled in me that fire of valor,
which clouded by some coward thoughts hath so

then my blood: you have, I say, awaked
me, and if I deferre by some valiant deed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
my wounded honor, you will do but justly
to make me the scorn and reproach of boys and
children; nor was he more slack in performance
then he had been in promising, for quite lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of his bragging humor, he became truly and
worthily valiant, and now deserves the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of all deserving personages, so great
a cure had this Magnamious Maid wrought.
These are, said <hi>Forcett,</hi> some particular passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of her life in your absence, to which the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
have been so correspondent, that should
I strive to applaud her vertues, truly I should
but whisper to you, what her Fame blazons
forth to the world.</p>
                           <p>I was both affected and afflicted, continued
<hi>Goodlake,</hi> at this relation of <hi>Forcetts,</hi> and I must
needs confess that I was never so nigh to have
swerved from the course of vertue, as I was now
for the estate which my dear friend <hi>Spancer</hi> had
left to her, I thought unworthily bestowed, and
could more willingly have hearkned to a Story
of her inconstancy and incontinency, that I
might have enjoyed the other moyety of his
lands, then thus to have heard the whole world
applaud her vertue: nay so much was I trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that whether it was out of covetize in my
self, or a real sence of the unreasonableness of
the gift to one of so mean birth, that I was
tempted to make a trial of this so fained piece
of chastity and vertue, which at length I resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to do, and in a disguise for some days fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49502:68"/>
her house, attempting her by all allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of courtship, and promises of rewards,
such as would in my thoughts have tempted an
Angel; but I found her still lamenting the
death of her <hi>Spencer,</hi> (which she had heard of
by some Gentlemen that came over in the same
ship with me) and resolutely bent that since she
had not the fortune to enjoy him as her Love,
she would never enjoy any; one day above the
rest I pressed into her privacy, where I found
her lamenting over the Picture of her beloved
<hi>Spencer,</hi> I stood some time aside listning, when
I might hear her say; It cannot sure be true that
thou art dead my <hi>Spencer,</hi> death could not be
so cruel to take thee in thy prime! but if he
hath, how happy is that earth that doth contain
thy breathless corps, how do the cold clay incir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cling
thy tomb, rejoyce that it's a neighbor to
so noble corps! Oh! that I were so happy to
lye by thee, but since that cannot be, I'le study
how to dye, that though our bodies lie at this
vast distance, our souls may meet and safely har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
together! and yet, why should I be so cruel
to my self, to whom thou vvast so unkinde as
not to leave me some few commands before thy
death! this Picture which is thy lively repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation,
is more courteous, 'twill not deny me
twenty thousand kisses, since the fates deny me
thee, it shall be my husband, for here I vow ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to marry other! At those words I stepped
to her, and snatching away the Picture, would
have departed with it, had not she, taking hold
of my cloaths, stopped me, and falling down on
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49502:69"/>
her knees, cried out, Oh Sir! for goodness sake
deprive me not of that Jewel which I prize a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the wealth of both the <hi>Indies,</hi> rather let
me beg you to possess your self of all I have,
and leave me onely that. You beg in vain, said I,
nor must you think that bribes vvill make me so
much wrong my friend as to leave his will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performed.
What was that friend, said she?
'Twas one, said I, loved you too well, nor did
deserve such inconstancy as you have been guilty
of, which made him charge and command me
when his soul was now ready to expire to come
hither, and force from thee this Picture, unfit
to grace a Strumpets chamber. Suspend not my
fear Sir, replied she, but let me know the name
of this cruel friend of yours. <hi>Spencer,</hi> said I
Villain, said she, starting up, thou liest, and so
much more damned is thy lie, by how much
thou wrongest by it the dead soul of him, who
whilest living, would have pulled out that
treacherous soul that durst have wronged that
chastity, which I have so intirely preserved for
him, and will for his memory. Nay, said I, if
you will be angry vent your passions alone, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.
Oh! stay, cried she, and though my <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>
could be cruel as to deprive me of what I
prize above my life, the onely remembrance I
had of him, yet be not you so inhumane as to
deny me to take my last farewel of it. I do not
much care, said I, if I grant your suit, provided
you will promise immediately to return it. As I
am chaste I will, replied she, and therewithal
gave her the picture, vvhich having kissed over,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49502:69"/>
she began afresh to cry out, Oh! thou perfect
resemblance of my Love, my dearest Love, for
whose safety I have every morning before the
Larks with their sweet Notes saluted bright <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rora,</hi>
and every night when all other humane
Creatures were buried in sleep; and none but
Stars were vvitnesses, poured forth Oraisons to
Heaven, for whose sake I have remained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and unspotted, though he hath been so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
with his last words to blast my memory,
accept yet this, and this kiss for my last farewel!
and here Sir, said she, since it must be so, take
this remembrance of my Lord, the sight of
vvhich hath often made me give alms, visit pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
and lend money to needy Travellers,
that Heaven might repay it <hi>Spencer,</hi> but with it
let me beg one boon, that if some few days
hence you hear I am expired, you will for his
sake, to whom you were once a friend, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
my corps to the grave. I was so extreamly
transported vvith this excess of vertue, (for
what else to call it I know not) that I was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
able to take the Picture, nor to undeceive
her, but recollecting my self, and pulling off
my disguise, no, said I, keep both it and withall
this Ring from off your <hi>Spencers</hi> finger, nor did
his love cease with his life, this Will brings
you a Legacy of five hundred pound <hi>per annum.</hi>
Oh! now you have told me that, replied she,
which makes my losse the greater by how much
his love was more superlative. But I hope Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Goodlake,</hi> continued she, you will excuse
me for my being so rash with you, 'twas your
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49502:70"/>
disguise caused it. I must rather beg excuse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
I, that I have been so harsh to you, though
I doubt not your pardon; since, said I, 'tis now
in vain to lament <hi>Spencers</hi> death, and that he
hath divided his Estate betwixt us, let those
loves which we severally ought to him, be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together in us. Alas! Sir, replied she, my
love is buried in his grave, and my resolutions
never to enjoy any other, sealed with a solemn
vow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but because you were his friend, I will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
to you a secret, which none else must know,
&amp; in which I doubt not but you will be partaker
with me. Willingly, said I, be it to pass through
dangers never undergone by men or devils yet.
Go then, said she, and e're you know farther,
purchase for me that ship which lies for sale in
the rode, see her well fitted and manned, I
have mony ready to defray all charges, and this
done, you shall know farther; I went accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as she desired me, though I could not yet
imagine what design she intended: I soon fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Frigat according to her order, colouring
both the Hull with black, and furnishing her
with Sable Sails, and Colours; this done and the
Frigat, (which she would have named the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro</hi>)
being munitioned with sixteen brass Guns,
and threescore and twelve stout men, I went
to acquaint her that she was now in readiness
to put to Sea, whom I found to have (whilest
I was taking care about the ship) had the same
care in sitting her self out for the voyage, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
setled her Estate in case of miscarriage,
and bestowed most of it to pious uses; being
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49502:70"/>
thus prepared, we soon set to sea, her self vested
in mans apparel, and having administred an
Oath to all in the Ship, not to discover her sex
upon any disasters whatsoever without her free
consent; to me she gave the command of the
Ship, and made <hi>Roughman,</hi> into whom she had
by her Magnanimous spirit inspired valor, my
Lieutenant, Mr. <hi>Forcett</hi> accompanied us as a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntier;
we were for many days blessed with
prosperous winds, steering our course directly
towards the Islands, within two days sail of
which we were encountred by a Spanish Man of
War, who stoutly attacqued us, but found that
resistance which he little expected, in sum, after
two hours fight (during all which time this Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous
Maid behaved her self with a more
then manly courage, cheering up the soldiers,
and her self in person ventring amongst the
thickest dangers) the <hi>Spaniard</hi> instead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
us his Prize became ours, onely with the
loss of seven of our best Seamen, but that was
recompenced by the damage which the enemy
fell, to wit, not onely of ship, goods and liberty,
but the lives of near forty of their men; yet
such was the generosity, that onely distributing
some of the riches of the spoil amongst the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners,
and disarming the Vessel, she gave those
that survived the Ship, and sent them away with
blessings for her courtesie; two days after this
encounter we arrived in the Port of <hi>Fial,</hi> where
she first discovered to the whole company what
she often before had in private told me, to wit,
that her whole intent of coming thither, was
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49502:71"/>
onely to fetch the body of her beloved <hi>Spencer,</hi>
and intomb it in a place where her self might
afterwards sleep with him; she therefore told
them, that now she must make the utmost proof
of all their affections to her, which would best
be expressed by their valorous attempting the
Town, and redeeming out of it the body of her
there slain Lover; they all seemed ready and
willing to accomplish her will, and though we
were but 65. in number, not any mans fears, or
doubts of ill success appeared in their faces, but
all were ready to fall on, yet I was loath to
think that so many good men should be cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and lost in vain, for with so small number
to have attaqued a Town then newly and
strongly refortified by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> would
have been an act of so great desperation, that
we should hardly have escaped the censure of
being guilty of our own murders; I therefore
advised that we should first man out our Boat,
to see if by the taking some stragling <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
we might come to know what force was in the
Town, before we attempted so hazardous an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize;
this counsel, after a small deliberation,
was agreed and assented to, and Mr. <hi>Forcett</hi>
with ten men taking the command of the Boat,
soon brought us in two <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom their
own fears made confess, that after the departure
of <hi>Essex</hi> his Fleet, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were returned,
and had with a new line begirt the Town, that
they had received great supplies both of men,
ammunition, and provision, from the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Fleet, but lately departed thence; that the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49502:71"/>
now in garrison, were two Companies of
foot, besides the inhabitants; but all this had
not deterred us from pursuing our first intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of assaulting it, had not the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the enquiry of our Virgin owners, informed
us, that the body of <hi>Spencer,</hi> though at first bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in the great Church, and a stately Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
reared over it, was upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
repossessing of the Town, it was removed thence
as the Corps of a Heretique, (as those of your
faith are pleased to stile us, though I believe
the greatest part of those our Nation rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
the Protestant Religion, as that which
they suck in with their mothers milk, then out
of any sounder reason or search into the depth
and truth of it) and buried in the fields, nor
was it yet permitted to rest there, for the man
that ought the field doubtful that his Corn
would never prosper, whilest his Land was fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with a Heretiques body, petitioned the
Church that it might be taken up and burnt,
which was easily granted, and as readily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
The impossibility therefore of effecting
our desires, or gaining what we came for, made
us desist from further pursuit of it, but not from
some part of our revenge, in battering down
some part of the Town and Church, upon those
who dealt so harshly with the body of our dead
friend; this we had scarcely performed when
from the main-top one of our Mariners espied
two sails coming in directly towards us, we had
no reason to guess them other then enemies,
and therefore immediately made ready to fight
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49502:72"/>
them, and because they should not have the
advantage of combating us in their own Port,
we made out, and to draw them somewhat far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off the land, that they might have no relief
from thence, made show of flying from them,
and they as greedily pursued us as the hungry
Tyger would his prey, but being as we thought
at sufficient distance from shore, tacked about
upon them, and easily gaining the Windward,
when we came nigher we might perceive that
the one was an <hi>English</hi> Merchant-man, made
Prize by the other a <hi>Spanish</hi> Rover; we were
mightily encouraged to finde that we had no
ods against us, and therefore readily clapt them
aboard, not doubting but to carry them at the
first assault, but our hopes failed us, for we were
not onely twice beaten back, but the third time
boarded by them, and had not our men been
more then men, we had utterly been lost; but
who would refuse to fight when they saw our
Magnanimous <hi>Amazon</hi> encouraging them, and
her self in the van, prostrating her tender body
to the greatest dangers, her valor it was that at
length repelled the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and prosecuting
the Victory (whilest I wounded in this last as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
was (unable longer to stand) retired to my
Cabbin) soon made those proud Dons vail their
Top-sail to her Maiden Flag: And now posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of her enemy, she next generously pursues
the release of the <hi>English</hi> prisoners, to whom
she freely restored both their ship and goods,
and supplied what dammage they had received,
out of the riches of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Pirate; but sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49502:72"/>
the persons of all the Prisoners, she
chanced to cast her eye upon one, whose coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
so absolutely represented her <hi>Spencer,</hi>
that had she not been confirmed by so many
convincing that he was dead, she would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
have challenged him for hers, but confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of his death she refrained, yet the so near
remembrance of him surprized her spirits, so
that swounding away, she was conveyed into
her Cabbin; nor were his eyes (for <hi>Spencer</hi> it
was indeed) during her stay less fixed upon her,
he believing that he had seen that face, but by
reason of her virile habit, not in the least dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it could be she; <hi>Roughman</hi> who was now
the chief in the ship during our owners indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
and my weakness, dispatched away the
Merchants ship to follow her intended traffick,
and thus were these two Lovers, by reason of my
wounds, no sooner met then parted, seeming
to know and yet not daring to know each other.
The <hi>Spanish</hi> Prize was equally divided amongst
the Sailors, and the Hull being made unser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
with our shot, sunck in; but it was the
care of this Magnanimous Maid that the <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jards</hi>
should all be safely set on shore at <hi>Fial,</hi>
which being done, we Roved for some months
over a wilderness of seas, seeking out revenge
upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for their inhumanity to
<hi>Spencers</hi> body; but at length we were forced
for want of fresh water, to put into <hi>Mamorrah,</hi>
a Port belonging to the Kingdom of <hi>Fosse,</hi> into
which being entred, our noble Virgin owner,
weary of her manly habit, revested her self in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49502:73"/>
most gorgeous feminine Robes, as well for her
own pleasure, as to let the Moors have a sight
of those beauties with which <hi>England</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched;
it is the custome in that Country that
as soon as any ship comes into haven, one of the
chief Beighs belonging to the King, goes aboard,
as well to take knowledge from whence she
came, and for what reasons she came thither, as
to take an account of her lading, which he is at
his return to deliver into the hands of the King
his Master; it fortuned that it was the turn of
<hi>Beigh Alcade</hi> to come aboard our Negro, who
being brought into the presence of our Heroick
Maid, was struck with such wonder and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at her excelling beauty, that not able to
require an account of us, he stood rather like a
Statue then any living soul, but at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting
himself, he fell down on his knees,
and terming her the Goddess of the Sea, made
proffer to kisse the hem of her garments, but
being raised up by her, and told that she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
no such adoration, but onely came in
thither to desire some relief of fresh water, and
other necessaries for her Seamen; he hardly
yet put out of his belief that she was some
Goddess, told her that all they had were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
too little for so divine a presence, and
that the hearts of men were oblations fitter for
her worth, then such mean and earthly things
as she desired: Talk not of divinity, replied
she, for we are all like you, mortals; nor come
we hither to be worshipped (though we know
you prone enough to adore novelties) but to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49502:73"/>
supply our necessities with which desires if you
please to acquaint your King, you will pay us
that service which we shall accknowledge as a
favour, and endeavour to requite. I am happy
dumbe Creature (answered <hi>Alcade</hi>) that the
Gods have at length been so favourable to me,
as to confer a bounty on me worthy themselves,
that is the serving you; our Heroick Virgin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
him thanks for his professed readiness to
supply our necessities, and having caused some
rich presents to be offered him, which he thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
accepted dismissed him to give an account
to <hi>Mullisheg</hi> King of <hi>Fesse</hi> his Master of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
who earnestly attended the success of
it, for the blackness of our sailes, Ship, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
had astonished not only himself, but all his
Subjects: <hi>Alcade</hi> being arrived at Court, the
King had not patience to attend his coming up
into the Presence, but meeting him almost at the
Gate, demanded of him what ladeing that
mournful Vessell brought, she brings, mighty

First that there should be liberty granted to her
and her attendants to leave the land at pleasure.
Secondly safe conduct to and from her Ship at
her own discretion. Thirdly that she might live
free from all violence either from the King
or any of his subjects. Fourthly that her Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
might be allowed fresh victuals aboard; and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49502:74"/>
lastly, That the King should offer nothing upon
her person more then what he should gaine by
free courtship and intreaty. These Articles
were no sooner sent, but returned, signed, and
confirmed; and we in confidence of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
accompanied the <hi>Bashaw</hi> on shore,
where we were received with all Magnificence
imagniable: <hi>Mullisheg</hi> was seated not purposly
for our reception, but according to custome upon
a Throne of three ascents, richly covered with a
Canopy of Gold, for the distribution of justice,
he had taken some admiration of her beauty at
the report of <hi>Alcade Beigh,</hi> but had not fansied
it so great as to him now it seemed, for in such
amazement was he strucken at the first glance of
her Sun-like beams, that not able to move him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from his imperial Throne, he there sate as if
he had been inchanted; but raising himself, he
descended and taking her by the hand, placed her
in the Chair, where his Royal Queen used some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
to sit, &amp; after having uttered several extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
speeches in the praise of her beauty, told
her that that day she should sit as supream Judge
for the triall of all causes should come before
him, amongst the rest there were two Christian
Merchants, one of which for stealing Custome
was fined one thousand Duckets, the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to a forfeiture both of Ship and goods,
both which by her intercession were released,
and the life of an English Divine saved, who vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
endeavoured to convert the Moores par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned;
but as these causes were debating, who
should come in as a Petitioner but her beloved
<hi>Spencer:</hi> 'twas strange what amazement seized
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49502:75"/>
upon us two at the sight of that which we could
take for nothing but his Ghost, nor was his
wonder less to see us there. I was just going to
salute him in that publick place and to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he were a reality or a shadow, had not his
fair love detained me, and advised me to take
some privater oportunity. Capt. <hi>Goodlake</hi> was
further persuing this story, then which <hi>Spinola</hi>
confessed he never heard one more delightful,
when he was interrupted by a messenger from
the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who came to acquaint
these two valiant Commanders, that the Duke of
<hi>Ferrara</hi> hearing that the Mantoves Army dayly
increased in numbers, and would in short time
arrive to such power as would be able to force
him from his seige, thought it more honourable
to raise it himself, &amp; before their numbers were
too much increased, give a second rout if posible,
which effected, the conquest of his whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
would assuredly follow; that to the end he
might find them the more unprovided, he had
filently raised his leagure, and that his vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
was already advanced within 12 miles of
<hi>Marandola,</hi> that therefore the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>
had sent for them to desire their speedy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill
what was sit to be done, <hi>Spinola</hi> returned
answer, that they would presently waite upon his
Highness, though he never went with more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
to consult of affaires which tended to his
honour, because he was forced to forgo the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of a story at an adventure, which he most
of all desired to hear.</p>

                        <p>THE heat of the Sun which was now
mounted to the highest of the <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diak,</hi>
made the famous great Duke
of <hi>Florence</hi> retire from his sport of
Hunting, to seek some cooler shade in an adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Wood, which with its Verdure seemed to
invite him, as well to delight his Sences with
the various Odours of all sweet smelling Flowrs
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49502:77"/>
which Nature had adorned that pleasant Soil
with, as to please his Opticks with their variety
of Dresses, which the frugal Earth had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
to bestow upon this fortunate Bower; but
more especially to shade himself from the too
violent beams of the Sun, under the broad spred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
leaves of the Oaks and Sycomores.</p>
                        <p>But riding thus along with all possible delight,
accompanied with a brave Squadron of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
to seek further pleasure, or to enjoy the
fruits of their former sport, drawing neer to
their intended repose; a place, which for its
beauties might have deserved the presence of
the chast <hi>Diana,</hi> a shrill and woman-like noise,
pierced the ears of this famous Duke, who
after having listned from whence their Cries
came, posted with his <hi>Pegasean</hi> Steed, and was
followed with no less swiftness by his Nobles,
to the assistance, as they supposed, of some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
Virgin.</p>
                        <p>Being arrived at the place, they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a villainous <hi>Bandetti</hi> to have surprised a
Lady of excellent beauty, and she not being
able to resist his force, was forced to submit her
tender arms to be tied to the boughs of a tree,
which seemed to bow and yeild obedience to
her, whilst the hellish Ravisher was preparing to
sacrfice her Chasity to his lust; if the grand
Duke at the <hi>Eccho</hi> of her cries made his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
feet strike Fountains out of the Rocks, with
the strength and swiftness of his running, he
now flew faster then the windes to rescue this
distressed Lady, and to execute a just venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49502:77"/>
upon the impious Villain, who durst at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
so horrid an iniquity upon one so like a
Goddess; but the base Catif-conscience of his
own desert, armed with the wings of fear and
guilt, fled into the thickest of the Wood, and
though pursued for some space by the Duke
himself, yet did those fair spreading boughs for
the present yeild both shelter and security to
the barberous Ravisher.</p>
                        <p>The Duke seeing it in vain to pursue him any
further, returned to the place where this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Lady was, so neer being made a prey to
ugly and deformed lust, whom he found to be
unbound by some of his, and at the sight of
him, advancing towards him; whither being
come, she fell down, and kissing his hand. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
sir, said she, For this act of succouring a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
woman, must needs assure me you are
so; Give me leave before I pay my Oraizons to
Heaven, or render that sublime thanks I owe
to you, to know to what worthy person of what
estate or degree I owe this wretched life, lest
otherwise I prove a Heretick to good Manners,
and strive not to render a thanks worthy the
person, since I can never do it worthy the favour.
Fairest of thy Sex, answered the Duke, since thy
Nobleness I need not question, whilst I see it
written in thy Forehead, I should want some of
that worth which you impute, if I should deny
your request; Know then, noble Lady, I am sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by my Subjects, Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> and Prince
of their Country, whose greatest happiness is,
that it can boast to have kissed your feet. The
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49502:78"/>
Prince of this Country (answered she) then
thus low must I fall to do a due Obeysance, and
therewithall would have faln with her face to
the ground, but was taken up by the Duke, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
O <hi>Madam!</hi> daign not to this sordid earth;
so great an honour as to kiss those fair lips,
which the Owner of this ground would be
proud to receive, and which the greatest Princes
may boast a Favour from. But, <hi>Madam,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
he, since my Stars have been so happy as
to make me the Minister to preserve your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
from barbarous violation; let me beg to
know for whose sake the gods have thrown so
great an Obligation upon me, and how they
came so much to forget themselves, as to let
you by an adverse Fate, be hurried into so great
danger. Though your <hi>Highness</hi> (answered
she) may justly demand this as a debt due to
the greatest Obligation ever was laid upon poor
distressed woman; yet to the favour of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that Jewel which I hold inestimable; let
me beg your Grace to suspend for some time
your desires by believing that my over-pressing
grief, will not let me to fulfil them farther then
to tell you, that by the raging of the boysterous
Seas, we were made a Shipwrack on the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Coasts; upon which, I was no sooner
safely landed, and had escaped the merciless
Seas, but we became a prey to those Villains,
from whence your Highness rescued me. Cruel
were those Seas (answered the Duke) and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the great Treasure they supported,
when they could be so obdurate to injure so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49502:78"/>
a Beauty: but for those <hi>Bandetties,</hi> who
durst in my Country (happy only in being your
Ref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ge) attempt such Impieties; they shall
assuredly feel both the power and the justice of
my Revenge: And thereupon turning to the
Lord <hi>Almerigho,</hi> Be it your care, said he, to get
in readiness a sufficient power to cleer these
Woods of those inhumane Robbers, and in the
mean time, let a <hi>Bando</hi> be published, porclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Reward of one thousand Crowns, to who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
should bring in the head of that soul and
beastly Ravisher. But, <hi>Madam,</hi> said he, I
suppose that grief through which I see your
Beauties shine, proceeds from the loss of some
friend, in this fatal Disaster. 'Tis true Sir, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
she, I have lost a friend, who striving to
defend me, over-powred by numbers, I fear me
fell by those <hi>Bandetties</hi> Swords, and cause enough
I have to doubt, lest my Maids Chastity be
made a prey to some Ravishers hot blood: We
have delayed too long time to rescue her, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the Duke; and therewithall commanded
some to go out in search of her, who soon
found her tied to a Tree, in the same manner as
her Lady was, but as yet unprejudiced in her
honour; for upon the noise of the Duke's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
fear had made the Villains desist from
their Design, and fly to seek their safety. The
Maid at the sight of her beloved Mistress, fell
down, and embracing her knees, uttered thousand
of expressions of joy for her deliverance, with
millions of blessings upon those who were the
Causers of it; but withall, assured her, that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49502:79"/>
she feared her friend who had fought so gallantly
for her was slain, for that she saw him desperatly
wounded, and pursued by at least a score of the
<hi>Bandetti.</hi> The Lady shewed feeling expressions
of grief in this relation; but the Duke endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by all means possible to comfort her,
withall telling her, that since Fortune had been
so adverse to her, as to cast her upon his shore,
he hoped she would not refuse the happiness to
bless his Court with her presence. Her present
condition made her easily yeild to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
offers of the Duke: so she was presently
mounted in a stately Chariot, which was come
there ready to attend his Highness, who entring
with her into the Coach, fed all the way upon
her excelling beauty, till the little blinde god
made his heart a prey to her perfections.</p>
                        <p>Being arrived at Court, the Duke strove to
entertain his strange guest with such extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
solemnity that from thence might be easily
perceived, that he bore her no ordinary affection,
the statelyest Lodgings in the whole Court
were appointed for her appartment, and many
Ladies of honour ordred to attend her, but she
would suffer none to waite upon her but her own
servant <hi>Maria.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Nor could all the sumptiousness of her enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
or the sports purposely invented by
the grand Duke, remove or make her abate his
melancholly humour, which had so fully possest
her that the joy for the misery she had escaped,
was forgot in the great sorrow she felt; for misery
she yet thought her self involved in, yet still so
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49502:79"/>
transparent did her beauty shine through that
veil of grief, that it seemed rather as a foile to
set of, then ablemish to her excellencies.</p>
                        <p>The grand Duke had a great desire to know the
person or quality of his fair guest, but finding her
so much over pressed with sorrow at any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her story, his love and civility obliged
him not to be troublesome to her, he therefore
addressed himself to her maid, and by gifts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to draw that from her which her
Mistresses griefs would not permit her to relate,
but she having recived a charge from her Lady
not to disclose any thing of her various fortunes,
he might as well attempted to have washed a
Blackmoore, or done things most impossible.</p>
                        <p>But whilst he both in vain persued his love to
his fair guest, and his desire to know her person
and quality, an unlookt for accident discovered
the last unto him, for a Merchant by chance, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received from forraign adventures a rich
Casket of the most curious Jewells of the
East, thought it his duty to make the
first show of them to his Prince, whose love
promted him to command this Merchant to
attend upon his beautifull guest and freely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
them to her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>hoice, as things only fit to
adorne so incomparable a Creature.</p>
                        <p>the Merchant according to the commands of
the Grand Duke, attended on the faire Mistress
of his Princes heart, freely making offer to her of
the most precious of his Jewells, all which she
slighted making choice of none but a small Ring
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49502:80"/>
and that only because her civility obliged her
not to reject the bounty of so great a Prince.</p>
                        <p>But upon the returne of <hi>Tignor Iacomo Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturo,</hi>
for so was the Merchant called to the
Grand Duke, he brought him a Jewell, which the
valued above all those of his Casket, to witt, the
knowledge of the person of his beautious guest,
assureing him that she was no other then that
vertuous English Damosell whose fame had
spread it self from the Court of the King of <hi>Fesse</hi>
over most parts of the <hi>Christian</hi> world.</p>
                        <p>The Duke was extreamly rejoyced that it
should be his happiness to entertain a person
whom fame had reported so highly deserving, yet
seemed somewhat to doubt the Merchants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
till he assured that the favour he received
from her (six of her men being rescued from the
Gallies by his intercession) had so ingrafted
her <hi>Idea</hi> in his mind, that it was impossible ever
to be eradi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>This conference of the Merchans made the
Duke as confidently believe what he was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
willing it should be so, and this belief sprung
in him a desire to hear a perfect relation of her
particular carriages in the Court of that mighty
King of <hi>Fesse</hi> and <hi>Morrocco,</hi> which though he had
darkly been informed of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

land <hi>Eccho</hi> of her far resounding fame, yet he
wanted that certain relation which his now
knowledge of her person made him desire.</p>
                        <p>He therefore commanded the Merchant to
acquaint him with his knowledge of that story,
which after some excuses of not being able to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49502:80"/>
performe his Highness desires so fully as he
might expect, yet resolving in obedience to his
commands to do his utmost endeavour; he thus
prosecuted.</p>

his own relation thus, that in few daies after
the departure of the fleet had recovered of those
wounds which by his friend he was thought to

thou so lately swor'st to? what faith can ever

at her Generosity, and amazed at the
Majesty of her Anger, his trembling hand let
slip his Sword, and falling back into his Throne,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49502:83"/>
he fixed his eyes upon the ground, and as if he
durst not look upon so much offended Beauty,
sate rather like a sensless <hi>Statua</hi> then a living
Prince.</p>
                           <p>But after a small time of revengefull Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(though his fury seemed all the while to
abate) he with a voice scarce demonstrating
the least passion, commanded his Attendant
Guard to seize on the Generous <hi>Spencer,</hi> which
they were as ready to effect, as he to command;
had not he resolutely determined (knowing
what would be the issue of a <hi>Moorish</hi> Prison) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to sell his life at the dearest rate with his
Sword in his hand, then be starved to death in
a loathsome Dungeon.</p>
                           <p>The Guard seeing themselves thus confron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and indeed repulsed, by one single man, in
the presence of their Prince, added fury to their
Numbers, and resolved all at once to suppress
him, but with such strength and courage, did he
brandish his death-threatning Sword, that like
those Rats who were to hang a Bell about the
cats neck, none durst be the first to approch him.</p>
                           <p>In the mean time, this worthy and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Maid, snatching from the ground the
<hi>Morrish</hi> Kings Sword, thrust her self amongst
the thickest of the Guard, to assist or defend her
generous Lover; and at length, coming to the
place where he was, she like a Breast-plate clapt
her self before him, endeavouring to receive or
defend all blows that were made at him; but
the timerous Guard, whether not daring to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
so much Beauty, or daunted at her heroick
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49502:83"/>
Courage, made no further attempt upon her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved

                           </p>
                           <p>The falling off of the Guard bred a pity of
these two Lovers in the heart of the Sable <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisheg;</hi>
yet he thought fit at first to make no
shew of it, but calling them before him with an
angry Countenance: Is it possible, said he, that
you should yet dare thus to affront me in my
own Court, whilst it lies in my power to inflict
on you the most terrible of Tortures? Tortures
(replyed this magnanimous Maid) know base
Tyrant, the most fell Tortures that ever barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

our fixt Resolutions, then Kings are able to
make the Heavens bow to do them Reverence:
for know, insulting king, our Loves are like the
Center of the World, so strongly seated in our
hearts, that nothing but a general dissolution
can shake them. Whilst the King sate still ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
and musing upon the Gallantry of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Maid; the Captain of the <hi>Negro</hi> who had
not been idle all this whiue, but shewed suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
demonstrations of his resolutions, to follow
the fate of his friends, adressing himself to

this effect. I need great King (said he) urge how
infamous you will becom by breaking that faith
which you so lately gave. Kings are easier in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
to action, which will add to their former
Glory, then by words deterred from those

now opportunity offered to do an action which
will make the great <hi>Mullisheg</hi> renowned through

the world joyn these two lovers hands, the story
of whose constancy, were it but related, would

                           <p>This speech of the Captaines wrought so
effectually with the inclining <hi>Mullisheg</hi> that

                           <p>Many other words passed to the like purport,
and so the company for the present withdrew to
the Kings Pallace, where shortly after all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
preparations were made for the Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49502:84"/>
of the Nuptials of these two English
lovers, but my occasions mighty Duke, calling
me from thence, I could not stay to see the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
solemnized, though I afterwards heard
that it was performed with wonderful state;
and since your Highness tells me that she was
cast by shipwrack into your countrey; I have
reason to beleive that great sorrow which at
present overshadowes that nature which used to
be civil, courteous, and debonair, is for the loss
of her husband who undoubtedly perisht in the
all devouring sea.</p>
                           <p>The Duke was extreamly delighted with this
relation of the Merchant, but especially with
the hopes he had of the worthy <hi>Spencers</hi> loss,
for he thought that might facilitate the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his beautious Mistress, which he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to leave no way unattempted to attain; and
therefore commanded the Merchant to go and
present her with own of his ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at ten thousand Crowns, knowing how

of women; but though her civility taught
her to accept the Dukes Jewel, yet her honour
inclined her to a resolution, that not a whole
Dukedome should tempt her to a violation of
her chastity.</p>
                           <p>Scarce was Sig. <hi>Iacomo Bonaventuro</hi> departed
to offer up his rich present, to the fair hands of
the fairest guest, but a messenger arrived to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
the Grand Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> that after
the long continued bloody warrs between the
two Dukes of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Ferrara,</hi> they had
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49502:85"/>
concluded a firme and lasting league; and were
resolved within two daies to visit <hi>Florence,</hi> to
make his Highness and his whole Court and
Countrey a witness of their late concluded ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The Duke received the Messenger with all
honour due to one, who came as agent from
two such Princes, returning them thanks suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the honour done him by such a visit, and
withal giving order that his Court should be
made to shine with Gold and Pearls, for their
more sumptuous entertainment.</p>
                           <p>Two daies after the two Princes arrived, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
met by the grand Duke, with an infinite train
of Nobility on horseback, three miles without
the City, and so with inexpressible state, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
to the Royal Palace, where the <hi>Tuscan</hi>
being seated on his Throne, and the two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
on each side of it, he endeavoured to make
their welcome grateful, by telling of them, that
the honour they had done him in leaving their
Courts to visit him, should be recorded as an
everlafting Trophy of their loves, and an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
monument, of a firm and perfect amity with
them both. They returned an address suitable to
his civility, by telling him, that having happily
composed their two long lasting differences,
they thought themselves oblieged, to make a
tender of their united league to his Highness, as
to greatest and most renowned Prince of <hi>Italy,</hi>
selecting him as a Royal witness of their blest
union: Nor must we, continued the Duke of
<hi>Mantua,</hi> forget to present unto your Highness
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49502:85"/>
this pair of Heroick Englishmen, who as they
defended us severally with their Armes, so they
united us in their friendship. I have heard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
long since (answered the <hi>Tuscan Duke)</hi> of
their Noble deeds of Armes, loud fame having
blazoned it into most Courts of <hi>Christendome,</hi>
but that they have been happy in reconciling
two Princes, and stopping that issue of blood,
would in time have overflowed their Countries,
makes them more glorious then all their acts
of Chivalry, and herewith he Rose from his
chair to salute the two <hi>English</hi> strangers, whom
he perceived made their addresses to kiss his
hand, which he would by no means permit, but
affectionately embracing them, told them that
persons of such great worth were not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
as Subjects, but Companions to Princes;
and though he knew no way to do it according
to their deserts: yet he should study to find one
out, they humbly on their knees returned
thanks to the Duke for his Noble reception, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing
themselves as not deserving any such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
at his hands; Your fame hath already suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
spoken your deserts (answered the grand
Duke) but if any of these Noble personages will
do me the honour to inform me of some of the
latter passages of that war, I doubt not but your
actions will best speak your character. 'Twas a
kind of a pleasant strife to see how the two
Dukes hastened which should first satisfie the
<hi>Thuscan,</hi> and do right to their Champions,

a victory from the <hi>Savoyards</hi> and <hi>Ferraresses,</hi>
and joyned their forces to mine, whereby I not
only gained their assistance, but other of my
Subjects having their hopes revived by their
victory, came flocking in to offer their service in
assistance of my cause, which they now accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
nothing less then desparate.</p>
                           <p>But the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> having advice of the
great supply which dayly came into my Army,
as he was incamped before my Metrapolitan Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Mantua,</hi> thought it the better policy to
raise his seige then to be raised from it, and I
suppose it was then debated in his counsel of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49502:86"/>
War, that every delay did but add more strength
to my forces, that the City was yet well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with all sorts of provision, strengthned with
a strong Garrison, and therefore not likely to be
surrendred or forced in a short time; that if he
could once more give a general defeat to my
forces, the City would of it self come in without
any resistance, that therefore the Duke should
immediately raise his seige, and if possible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
me to a battel.</p>
                           <p>This last conclusion was made a resolve, and
such was their expedition in advancing towards
us, or the negligence of my Scouts, that the
whole Army of the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> was scarce
half a daies march distant, ere I had any advice
of their motion, which put me at first into some
distraction, but finding all delays to be so many
presenting perils, I immediately called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of War, where it was with one voice advised
and assented to, that I should with all speed draw
out my whole forces, and give my then Enemy
Battel.</p>
                           <p>Thus were the plains of <hi>Merandola</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time to be made the stage whereon we
were to act a bloody Scene, for we had advice
that the enemy not much above four leagues off
was entring upon them, nor was that large
<hi>Champayne</hi> above half a League distant from
our Camp. The Sun had about two houres de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
towards the Western Horizon, when our
whole Army, consisting of about five thousand
horse, and twelve thousand foot advanced, and
somewhat before sunset, faced the Duke of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi>'s
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49502:87"/>
Camp, who with about the same number
of horse and foot, had seated himself with their
backs directly opposing the morning sun.</p>
                           <p>'Twas strange that two so great Armies
should lie so close together with so little noise,
neither being guilty of the least excursion du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the whole night, though I must confess I
was advised by some, and that not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
to have immediately fallen upon <hi>Ferrara</hi>'s
Forces, whilst I had the advantage of the setting
sun, which darted i'ts rayes just into the faces of
my Enemies; besides, it was urged that the <hi>Fera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resses,</hi>
having had many long &amp; tedious marches
without intermission, must needs be very wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and so easily be overcome by a fresh Army,
but all those arguments were opposed by the
generous <hi>Goodlake,</hi> bravely encouraging me to
scorn to take the least advantage of a foe, whose
numbers exceeded not mine.</p>
                           <p>The next day before the sun had displayed it's
Golden Rayes upon the Parched earth, the
Drums and Trumpets Alarum'd both Armies to
their bloody work, my right wing of Horse I
committed to the charge of the thrice Noble
<hi>Spinola</hi> and the gallant <hi>Goodlake,</hi> the left wing
was committed to the charge of that worthy

side those troops which his presence had before
made victorious, now fled as fast as they before
pursued, before my valient Commander. In this
variety of fortune did the battel continue on
both sides, for the whole day those two noble
strangers, seeming as it were the soules of the
two Armies which moved those great bodies at
their pleasure, till after Sun-set the approaching
darkness of the night, rather then any other

<hi>Hector,</hi> was again renewed, such was the
ponderousness of the strokes that they would
have forced the Heaven, assaulting Giants to
have bowed under them.</p>
                           <p>But how soon was this storme changed into
a calme. These two Champions who but just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
with such violence and fury assaulted each
other; on a suddain to the amazement of us all
threw away their Swords, and leaping of their
Horses cast themselves into mutual embraces:
We were doubtful, at first what to think of this
so strange adventure, some were of opinion that
they still fought, affirming that it was the manner
of <hi>England,</hi> not to stand overlong dallying with
their Swords, but by closing try out the issue of
the fight by strength; others beleived that by
some accident, they had come to make some
happy discovery of themselves to be two friends,
and were now imbracing (which was indeed the
truth) and renewing their antient friendship,
nor wanted there some to beleive that, one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
had yeilded to the other, though they could
not guess which; yet either in the interim beleived
themselves betraied.</p>
                           <p>The agreement made that none should stir,
from their post, to assist or encourage either
Champion, made us with the greater patience
await an issue, which after no short time of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
was brought to either side by the
combatants themselves. <hi>Good lack</hi> being arrived
at my Tent, I was very inquisitive to know the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49502:91"/>
reason of that strange amity so suddenly agreed
upon between two soes, who I beleive went
with as equall regret and hatred to the seild, as
did <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Neoptolomus,</hi> when the one vow'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to revenge the death of a father, the other of a
friend and brother.</p>
                           <p>But the intreated me to restrain my curiosty,
till such time as I could call a general Counsel
of War; to whom he desited publickly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the event: I assented to his request, and
having summoned all the cheif officers of my
army together, seats being taken according to
order, he thus began to relate the story.</p>
                           <p>
                              <q>That I have, Noble <hi>Mantoveses,</hi> ever since
I entertained your Dukes service, behaved my
self both as became a souldier &amp; Commander,
I hope there's none here will gain say, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that I have alwaies readily ventured my
life to the greatest hazards, perrils and dangers,
which the various chance, &amp; fortune of this warr
hath cast before me; and yet I think never any
of you before heard me so much sound forth
my own praises: nor do I now make this <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordium,</hi>
either to angment my own, or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
your worth, but to tell you that I can
now no more hazard my blood for you, that
life which before was a butthen, is now grown
precious to me, and I may say that through
both yours and the Duke of <hi>Ferrara's</hi> Armies,
are still in the feild as opposites, I have by your
warrs gained such a <hi>requiem</hi> as just a period to
my further labours. For I have found my
friend for whose only sake or rather for whose
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49502:91"/>
supposed loss I became your friend, and
<hi>Ferrara's</hi> foe; let your contracts then migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Sir end in our friendship, and as we have
shewed you an example, through away your
blood thirsty swords, and turne your emnity
in to embraces.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>He would I beleive have proceeded farther to
our admiration, had not the arrival of a Herald
from the Duke of <hi>Ferrara's</hi> Camp, requiring
speedy audience obstructed him, who being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
addressing himself to me, told me that
he beleived my Champion had already prepared
me with what he came about; that his Master in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
by the strange accident which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
between the two Combatants, was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
likewise to lay aside his offensive armes, and
embrace me with those of an eternall friendship;
that to that effect he had sent me such conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as he thought could not in honour refuse.
That he was ready to yeild up to me all those
Lands in contention, save only the small Town
and Castle of <hi>Torre Necova,</hi> which standing on
the other side of the River, were known ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to belong to the Dukedome of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> that if
I refused these offers, he doubted not but in the
end, I should have reason to repent the loss
of so fair an oportunity to conclude an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amity.</p>
                           <p>The conditions were so honourable, that it
had been a dishonour in me to refuse them; so
with the Herald, I returned an honourable mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
of my own to acquaint the Duke, that if
he would be pleased to grant me an interview
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49502:92"/>
between both Armies, I doubted not but we
should have occasion to free our Countries from
further Alarums by concluding a firme and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
league.</p>
                           <p>My messenger was honourably received, my
message accepted, the interview had, and all
things easily agreed upon, and thus (Noble
Prince have) I in brief related to you how those
warrs, which had cost the lives of so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of our Subjects, were in few houres space
by the mediation of those worthy persons, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
in a happy and lasting peace, a witness
whereof we are come to make your Highness,
your whole Court and people.</p>
                           <p>The Grand Duke was extreamly delighted
with this relation of the Duke of <hi>Mantova</hi> ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
forth innumerable praises in honour of the
English Nation, and studying how he might

had wrought so much good in <hi>Italy,</hi> when there
entred into the presence Chamber, a Gentleman
of a gallant aspect, bearing upon the point of his
sword the head of one, whom it appeared he
had overcome.</p>
                           <p>Being come within hearing of the Duke,
kneeling down he made this adress to him.
Shew your self (Noble Sir) that bountiful Prince
to strangers, which all the world reports you, by
paying to me that debt which your Proclamation
makes due to him who could bring the head of
the Chaptain of <hi>Bandetties,</hi> which thus low I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to your highness feet: We should shew our
selves ingrateful (answered the Duke) and much

should we deny you your well purchased reward;
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ut let su s farther beg to know to what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
man we owe this service. I am mighty
Prince (said he) by birth an <hi>Englishman;</hi> an
<hi>Englishman</hi> answered the Duke, must my Court
erect then farther Trophees to the glory of
that renowned Nation. Command the two
Champions hither, for certainly they must be
all three allied as well in blood as in their Noble
actions.</p>
                           <p>A messenger quickly hastned <hi>Spencer</hi> and
<hi>Goodlake</hi> into the presence, who no sooner entred
were, but <hi>Ruffman,</hi> for he it was looking stedfastly
upon them, and knowing them to be his dearest
two friends, ran &amp; embracing them, cried out to
the Duke, most Ilustrious Prince, you now owe
me nothing, to shew me this is a reward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
your whole Dukedome; and therewithall
returned again to imbrace his friends, and they
him, with so much extasie that all the presence
perceived the affection was not common.</p>
                           <p>But the earnest desire <hi>Spencer</hi> had to hear
some new's of his dearely beloved, whom he had
lest aboard-ship with <hi>Ruffman,</hi> and bound for
<hi>England;</hi> made him desire leave of the Duke to
retire with his friends, which being easily gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
they having found out a privacy, he with
great importunity demands of <hi>Ruffman</hi> what
was become of his beautiful spouse, or whether he
had deserted her and sent her alone for <hi>England:</hi>
deserted her, (replied <hi>Ruffman</hi>) if all the Devills
in Hell had conspired together they could not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49502:93"/>
have possessed me with so much ingratitude; but
pray Sir Arme your self with patience, for I have
the tuthfullest story to relate that ever your ears
yet heard. My constant misfortunes (answered
<hi>Spencer</hi>) have been so sufficient proofs of my
patience, that nothing I beleive can now shake
it; the Gods grant it answered <hi>Ruffman</hi> for I
fear it will else totter, when I shall tell you that
the next day after you were by the unkind
winds parted from us, we were thrown among
the Rocks on this Coast of <hi>Florence;</hi> but
escaping the furies of the Sea, ran into a greater
Sea of miseries: for set upon by some bloody
minded <hi>Bandetties,</hi> I was inforced by their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
to permit your beantious Mistress to be
snatcht away by one, whose lookes dencted rape
and murther, nor was it in the power of any but
a deity to rescue her; yet if she be murdered, I
have at least given this satisfaction to her Ghost,
to have revenged her on the villan. These
words notwithstanding, his firme resolution
could do no less then for present deprive the
generous <hi>Spencer</hi> of his senses, to which being
again by the care of his two friends revived;
they began to comfort him with hopes that the
Gods could not permit such an unparraleld p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of vertue and beauty to suffer such outrage, but
would rather themselves descend from Heaven
to her succour.</p>
                           <p>In the mean time the grand Duke thought all
the entertainemnts he was forced to give to
the two Princes of <hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Mantua</hi> tedious,
because it debarred him from giving a visit to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49502:93"/>
his fair Mistress, whose beauty had gained such
power over his heart, that all things else seemed
to him but a trouble and vexation to him, night
therefore approaching he hastened the two
Dukes to their appartment, and that he might
give the fire of his love some fewell to feed on,
having selected out some trusty Musitians, he
retired under the Chamber window of his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-excellent
guest, where he caused the ensuing
Song to be sung.</p>

happy. Is it love then my Lord (answered she)
that prompted you to this paines? Alas mighty
Sir, how much do you debase your greatness, to
cast an eye upon so mean and unworthy a person
as my self, yet Noble Prince, consider and let the
thoughts of my meaness restrain in you those
wild desires. Thou art all goodness and all beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
(answered he) and that makes thee greater
then I am, oh good my Lord, answered she, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive***
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49502:95"/>
not your self by thinking to gain that
from me by your statteties, which all the power
of men, nor Divells, shall not force from me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
therefore my Lord from this enterprize,
which will in the end so much dishonour you;
and think not my Lord, that because you preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
my chastity from the villanous <hi>Bandetti,</hi>
that you have any right to violate it: at these
words she was going in, had not the Duke recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
her, by saying dear Madam stay, and at least
grant me this request, that your Gentlewoman
may relate to me the continuance of your story
that if you will not grant me your love, yet I
may have liberty to admire you. In that (said
she) or any thing else I may with honour, I am
ready to serve your Highness and so departed.</p>
                           <p>The Duke remained inwardly vexed for his ill
success, so that he could hardly rest, yet he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
comforted himself, with hopes of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
story he was to hear next morning; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no sooner was the Sun mounted an hours
course, but he sent to his fair Mistress to mind her
of her promise, who immediatly sent her Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
to waite upon his Highness, who carrying
her into an Arbour, fit by reason of the privacy
of it, for such a purpose, she thus began.</p>

                           <p>YOur Highness having already informed me,
that you have heard so farr of my Ladies
story as arrived to the promise of the Moorish
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49502:96"/>
King to unite her hand (as she had already fixed
her heart) with her beloved <hi>Spencer</hi> I shall not
need to make a new recital of it, but proceed to
what followes.</p>
                           <p>The some urgent affaires of State, rather then
the present season of the year induced <hi>Mullisheg;</hi>
some few daies after his Royal promise was
past for the marriage of this Noble and Peerless
paire of constant Lovers, to remove his Court
to the famous Sea Port Town of <hi>Algiers,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
induced as much by their own inclination,
as the earnest desires of the <hi>Moorish</hi> King, he
was accompanied by the generous <hi>Spencer</hi> and
his lovely Spouse, whilst the worthy <hi>Goodlake</hi>
took charge of the Frigat to carry her round by
Sea to the same Port.</p>
                           <p>The grand Duke seemed to be somwhat trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
at the name of <hi>Goodlake,</hi> for he remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> had given the same
demonstration to his Heroick Champion, which
made him doubt that the other stranger who
had done such famous acts on the part of <hi>Ferrara,</hi>
which was the gallant <hi>Spencer,</hi> the husband of
his beloved guest, but for the present smother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his imaginations, <hi>Maria</hi> thus continued.</p>
                           <p>Being all arrived in safty at <hi>Algiers,</hi> the
<hi>Moresco</hi> King having dispatched his most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
affaires of State, was put in minde of
his promise, to solemnize the Marriage rig hts
between these two Noble Lovers, which he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
assented to; himself in presence with his
Queen gracing their Wedding, the cerimonies
of which were performed by that English Preist
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49502:96"/>
whose life my Ladies intercession had saved,
and costly banquets being prepared at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of the <hi>Morocco</hi> treasure; there wanted
no magnifience which might indeed befit the
marriage of the greatest Princes.</p>
                           <p>Many daies did these Lovers, in the full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of conjugall bliss, live with all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
content in the black Kings Court, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
which delights in nothing but varieties and
changes, soon altred the Scene of their happiness,
&amp; overclouded all their joyes by the relapse of
King <hi>Mullisheg,</hi> who again bewitched with the
love of my beautious Mistress, out of hopes that
he might now sooner gain his desires on her, fell
back from that course of vertue which had made
him glorious, and by a violent passion, sought
to entrap her honour.</p>
                           <p>Nor did perverse chance think it enough, that
the great <hi>Mullisheg</hi> thus deviated from all the
rules of honour, but to make the misery of these
two constant Lovers more compleat, the Queen
of <hi>Fesse,</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> a Lady of a haughty spirit
and not enduring an imagined injury, whether
moved out of a jealousy of her husband, or out of
a reall affection, was inspired with the same un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
passion towards the worthy <hi>Spencer,</hi> as the
King her husband was towards this lovly Bride
my dear Lady. Thus did both these Princes strive
to rob two of the most constant and most deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
souls, that ever History made mention of,
of that joy and content which they had yet but
enjoyed in the blossome.</p>
                           <p>The King who had most power to act, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49502:97"/>
indeed to force what his lust prompted him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
having heard some secret whispers of ouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to escape his Court, and getting aboard
our Ship, sayle home to <hi>England,</hi> gave order to
<hi>Alcade Beigh,</hi> to cast a curious eye upon the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<hi>Spencer,</hi> &amp; my Lady; and if possible, not to
be at any time absent from them, or at least from
one of them, so that all hopes of getting away
by stealth was taken away from us, for indeed
some such thing had been determined of, the
passion of <hi>Mullisheg,</hi> being dayly observed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
more and more, and like a blazing Comet
to portend some prodigious effects: Nor
was that of the Lady <hi>Tota,</hi> his Queen to the
worthy <hi>Spencer,</hi> utterly hid from us, though she
carried it with more policy and privacy.</p>
                           <p>Our stay and my Ladies continual being in the
presence of the lacivious <hi>Mullisheg,</hi> was like fire
adding continual fewell to the flames of his lust,
which in the end burnt so strongly, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
by one meanes or another to quench it,
though by the doing of it, he forfeited all the
rules of honour and hospitality, broke his
word given, and murdered those guests he
had sworne to preserve; yet in what manner
to attempt it again he knew not, those brave
and Noble, repulses he had before received
from her, disheartned him from attemping it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her own person, he now thought it fitter to
use a Proxie and therefore resolved to make the
vertuous Captain <hi>Goodlake,</hi> the Baud to his lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
desires, this determination he of all best
liked, yet knew that such was the goodness of that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49502:97"/>
person, that his very looks would force a blush
from the most savag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Moor, should he but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to him a thought so vile and unworthy, he
therefore resolved to take the <hi>Roman</hi> Poets ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and write those things which his shame
would not let him speak, and accordingly after
having some few dayes graced the Captain,
with extraordinary and unusual honours, he pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
delivered to him this Letter.</p>

by the valiant <hi>Ruffman</hi> his Lieutenant,

the Queen <hi>Tota,</hi> who by threats and promises

<hi>Spencer,</hi> to grant her the enjoyment of his
loves.</p>
                           <p>This Story no less confounded the generous
Captain, then his Lieurenant was startled, when
at his desire he took up the pieces of his torne
Letter and read it, their cases being both alike,
they thought fit to resolve on some course for
their own safety, and the preservation of their
friends honours, which whilest they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly
consulting about, they were encountred
by the two loyal Lovers, who in their angry
fronts could discover no less then a direful

how to escape this cloudy tempest, which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49502:99"/>
hung so threatningly over their heads, but in a
business of so great consequence their opinions
were confused, and indeed they knew not what
to do, till my magnanimous Mistress turning to
her beloved <hi>Spencer,</hi> (and Women they say
have the sharpest wits in such exigencies) My
dear Friend, said She, desperate diseases must
have desperate cures, there remains no way to
escape the violent lust and fury of the Moorish
King and Queen, but by a violent hazarding
our own lives: Yet before we come to make
use of force, we must work with disimulation;
you my dear Soul said I must learn to counter feit
an affection to the Queen, whilest I seem to
smile upon the lacivious King, and doubt not
but we shall in short time find a means to escape:
the effecting of which, we must leave to the
wisdom, courage, and sole Management of these
two their Agents, who I know by sound ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
will not fear death it self, for our
safety.</p>
                           <p>They all seemed to applaud her Counsel, but
because the place was somewhat too publique
for such a debate, they retired to a greater pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy,
where they at large consulted of what
they resolved, afterwards to put in execution
when opportunity should offer it self.</p>
                           <p>Nor was it longer the importunity of <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisheg</hi>
forced them to anticipate even their own
thoughts; For he thinking that <hi>Goodlake</hi> dallyed
with him, with open Threats injoyned him to
effect his purpose, or expect the effects of his
fury, nor was the Queen less impatient to have
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49502:99"/>
her Lascivious thoughts satisfied by the noble
<hi>Spencer,</hi> which made these two worthy friends
resolve now to use their utmost art and
power, for the delivery of those two loyal
Lovers.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Goodlake</hi> in the first place, therefore desires
the King that an appartment might be of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
appointed, as a thing necessary for the
bringing his desires to pass, withall assuring him
that he had gained the absolute consent of my
beautous Mistress, to entertain him in her em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces,
the night following; but that she desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that to cover her blushes, that he would be
pleased to approach her in the dark, when she
would not fail to entertain his Majesty with the
greatest caresses of love. In the mean time,
<hi>Ruffman</hi> had acquainted the Queen, that by
reason of the suddain change of Lodgings,
where with the two Lovers were yet unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he would bring her Majesty into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where she should all night lye linked in the
Arms of the generous <hi>Spencer,</hi> and he receive
her as his beloved Bride.</p>
                           <p>This lascicious pair were both highly conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

                              <pb n="118" facs="tcp:49502:100"/>These two thus lodged there, yet remained
the hardest part to act to avert the dependent
Tragedy; The curious eyes of <hi>Alcade-Beigh</hi>
like those of another <hi>Argo's,</hi> still waited so
exactly upon the generous <hi>Spencer,</hi> or upon his
fair Bride, that it was impossible for them to
pass the gates together; nor could the worthy
<hi>Spencer</hi> at first perswade my lovely Mistress to
leave him to his better starrs, and go with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Goodlake, Ruffman,</hi> and the rest, to secure
her own Person: But at length overpowred
with Arguments, That it must be the only way
to procure all their safeties, she vowing, that if
by the next morning he came not safe aboard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
she accounting him slain, would assuredly
follow him in death; consented to go.</p>
                           <p>Captain <hi>Goodlake</hi> having got the Kings privy
Signet, and the Military Word, for that night,
under pretence of passing up and down from
lodging to lodging for the better accomodating
of the lustful <hi>Mullisheg,</hi> with my fair Lady, we
easily with them passed the Court Gates, and
so securely to the Sea-side, where we found a
worthy Gentleman Mr. <hi>Forcet,</hi> with the Boat
well-manned and armed, ready to waft us
aboard whether being happily come, our selves
we hastned it back, in hopes it might return
laden with the generous <hi>Spencer,</hi> whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
we now only wanted.</p>
                           <p>But long did we in vain expect, what we so
earnestly desired, and much longer it seemed,
by how much more we did desire it; for after
our departure, the noble <hi>Spencer</hi> found himself
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49502:100"/>
so haunted by <hi>Alcade-Beigh,</hi> that he could not
possibly pass any venny of the Court, which so
enraged him, that he was once resolved with
the suddain death of the <hi>Beigh,</hi> to rid himself
of so burdensome a Companion, but the great
danger in this, having for sometime restrained
him, he at length thought of a slight which
much better served his purpose, for knowing
that <hi>Alcade-Beigh</hi> was not ignorant, that the
King his Master had lately attempted alwayes
possible to enjoy his lovely Guest, and that he
had the promises of <hi>Goodlake</hi> to effect it; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to dissemble a passion, as if he then really
had her in his lustful embraces. The <hi>Beigh</hi>
who had heard him utter somewhat to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
not only left him to his own guard, but
freely proffered him passage through the Court
Gates; Fondly imagining that his absence
would make the King rest more securely with
his Spouse.</p>
                           <p>But <hi>Spencer</hi> being passed those Gates, there
yet attended him a more unluckly fate, for
missing his way to the Sea on that side the
Town, where our Boat waited for him, he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advisedly
ran upon the other, which lying open
to a small Cittadel, ingarrisoned by <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
not far distant, makes the <hi>Moors</hi> constantly keep
a strong Guard, both of Horse and Foot there;
a party of about forty Foot were usually set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Bridge, not above two hundred paces from
the Town, amongst these <hi>Spencers</hi> unhappy
stars first led him, by whom he was commanded
to stand, and show a reason of his being there
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49502:101"/>
so late; but he now first sensible of his error,
would have returned without returning any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
which they perceiving about eight or ten
in number swiftly pursued him, who was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon no conditions to yield himself Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and therefore with his Sword in his hand
turned upon them, resolving dearly to sacrifice

great numbers both of Horse and Foot came

endeavoured to make an obstinate resistance;
several of the faint-hearted <hi>Moors</hi> being forced
to fall under the power of his revengeful arm, in

stood admiring at the noble courage of this
Person, whom yet he knew not. But at length

his enemies.</p>
                           <p>But he was yet happy in being thus a Prisoner,
for being brought before <hi>Ioffer-Bassa,</hi> a Person

Telling him, that though he could not but
wonder at his noble deeds, yet he must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore'd

keeping him his Prisoner, though he could ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

have wish't fortune to have laid open some
way for his escape, and not rendred him a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to him, who could only love and honour
him, but not help him: By this nobleness
(answered <hi>Spencer)</hi> I am confirmed you are
<hi>Ioffer,</hi> chief Bashaw to the Great <hi>Mullisheg,</hi>
whom I have alwayes found full of worthy and
gallant thoughts. And I now know you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the <hi>Bassa,</hi> for that brave Englishman, so
highly graced in the Court of the mighty King
of <hi>Fesse</hi> and <hi>Morocco;</hi> My Master, which makes
me the more admire, that in requital of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
you should thus slaughter his beloved
Subjects, by which you have made a double
forfeit of your life; for the outrage committed
against his Guard at the dead of night, is death
in it self; but those you have slain in the
conflict, makes it exceed all bounds of Pardon;
For death, answered the Gallant <hi>Spencer,</hi> it
does not at all trouble me; but I have some
private thoughts torment me, more then ten
thousand tortures could; and herewith this
brave Soul fetching a sigh, could not restrain
some tears, which the thoughts of his beloved
Spouse made gush out. When the noble <hi>Bassa</hi>
seeing his discomposure, commanded the Guard
to depart, and leave the Prisoner alone with
him.</p>
                           <p>The Guard readily obeyed the command of
their General, when he taking opportunity
from the Solitude addressed himself to his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
in these generous terms; Sir, (said he)
though I am a Moor, a Nation strange to you
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49502:102"/>
Christians; yet, think that I can be noble; but
in you I have observed such strange contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that I cannot tell well how to reconcile
them; for when I consider your mighty actions
and late greatness of your Spirit, when my men
flew before you like dust before the wind, I
cannot but admire at your present passion, and
justly wonder why such a small effuse of blood,
let out by these sleight wounds, or the pale-fear
of grisly death should draw a tear for such a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
eye; Thou most worthy of thy Nation
(replyed <hi>Spencer)</hi> do not so much mistake me,
to think that wounds, blood, death, or all tortures
imaginable, could force one drop from hence;
but that I now suffer under, as far exceeds all
torments that ever the wicked art, or wit of
Man invented, as Hell doth Heaven in pains.
This it is, that like the burning Sun extracts
from my declining Soul, this dewy and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
morsture: Sir, (answered the <hi>Bassa)</hi> if I
have yet gained in you an opinion, that I dare
be noble, impart to me your sorrow's, and if
any thing in my power can assist you, though it
be with the hazard of my life, rest assured I will
perform it. Your Nobleness most Illustrious
<hi>Bassa</hi> (answered <hi>Spencer)</hi> obliges me to relate
my misfortune, though I must despair of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
yet if you have a heart not wholly compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of Adamant, it must needs melt it, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
my misery; and think then Sir, if you
have ever loved, or if ever you loved one so fair,
so constant, so chast, as my dear Spouse; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it would not confound you, and make
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49502:102"/>
whole Oceans of tears flow from your eyes, to
know that for your sake she was betrayed to a
black and remediless-fate? I confess (answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the <hi>Bassa)</hi> It would perplex a well-blassed
Soul; but how can this be your condition? were
not all your joy's but lately consummate, by
uniting your Souls, according to your own
manner of marriage, and were you not but
yesterday both honoured in the highest degree,
by the vertuous <hi>Mullisheg?</hi> 'Tis true, worthy
<hi>Bassa,</hi> (replyed <hi>Spencer)</hi> he honoured us at first
too much, but at length his lust outway'd his
honour, and as if his Soul had been of a darker
Eye then his Face; he sought to take away
that he had given me, and rob me of that
Jewel 1 prize far above my Life; but the fates
were yet happy unto me, in that I found means
this night to convey my beauteous Spouse, the
Captain, and Lieutenant, and others aboard
Ship, and now my self intended to follow them,
but missing my way fell amongst your Guard,
where wonder not that I performed wonders,
and durst single oppose my self against your
multitudes; for it was the impression she had
left upon my heart, made me act things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
a man. But Sir, (replyed <hi>Ioffer)</hi> since
she is safe aboard, recal your noble spirits, and
let not your own fates thus distract you. Ah!
generous Sir, (said <hi>Spencer)</hi> the sting of all is
yet behind, I at her parting from me, swore by
the honour of a Gentleman, and by all the
vow's and loves had ever past between us, that
if I survived, I would visit her aboard before
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49502:103"/>
the morning Star appeared, which she seconded
with a solemn vow, that if I did not she should
certainly esteem me dead, and not Heaven it
self should hinder her from following me to the
Grave, This Great <hi>Bassa</hi> is it; Fear of her safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
not my own, that drew these tears from a
Souldiers eyes. 'Twas strange what noble pitty
this relation bred in the heart of the thrice
worthy <hi>Moor:</hi> Noble Sir, said he, you have
indeed told me story would move the very
Rocks to pitty, and that I may let you know,
all moral virtues are not wholly and only seated
in the hearts of <hi>Christians;</hi> Go freely, pass to
your Love and preserve her Life, I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
you to return, but if you do not remember,
this Head of mine goes in exchange for yours,
which I cannot lay down in a better service.
My worthy Lord was so startled at this high
generosity of the <hi>Moors,</hi> that he knew not what
answer to return, nor indeed how to accept his
so obliging proffer; but at length considering it
would be the preservation of his dearest Spouse,
he resolved not to refuse the Courtesy, but
withall desiring the <hi>Bassa</hi> to oblige him by
some solemn Oath, to return at an appointed
hour: No, (replyed <hi>Ioffer)</hi> it will be sufficient,
if you give me your word to return by that
time to morrow, that the Sun shall be mounted
to the Meridian: Let God's and Men (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
<hi>Spencer)</hi> conspire to make me miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
if I fail one Minute; Let me then conduct
you, said the <hi>Bassa,</hi> past all watches, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
himself in Person brought him to the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49502:103"/>
place where the Boat did attend him, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him with an inexpressible joy.</p>
                           <p>The Discourse between the <hi>Bassa</hi> and <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>
had spent the greatest part of the night; so
that before they arrived at the Boat, it was near
break of day, and before any discovery could be
made of them coming towards the Ship, day
was absolutely broke, and the Sun even ready
to advance it's head above the <hi>Cerulean</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines.
My dear Lady, with infinite impatience
had all this while expected the coming of her
<hi>Spencer,</hi> according to his promise; but finding
him not yet appear, concluding him dead; she
began to utter such miserable lamentations as
are impossible for me to recite; and calling for
an Hour-glass, resolved as soon as that poor
moment of time was spent, either to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
her dear <hi>Spencer</hi> safe, or follow him in
death.</p>
                           <p>The last minutes were now running, when
with a full mouth of joy one of the say lors
calls from the Topmast-head that the Boat was
coming towards us, and that he did plainly
discern the generous <hi>Spencer</hi> sitting in her stern;
't was my good fortune to carry this news first
to my Mistress, who entertained it with such a
rapture, that her joy now put her into no less
an extasie then her grief before had done; but
having past over that discomposure, which at
her first hearing these glad tidings had seized
her, she issued out of her Cabbin to entertain
her <hi>Spencer,</hi> with a joy suitable to the love she
bore him,</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="126" facs="tcp:49502:104"/>'Tis impossible for me (mighty Prince) to
tell you with what joyful, and what obliging ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
she entertained him aboard; but how
soon was all her joy turned into a super-abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
sorrow; for he having a great while listned
to her loving expressions, without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
any answer, at length to her earnest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties,
gave this fatal one? Alas! my dear
Soul, now I have seen thee, I must again leave
thee: These Words were like a Thunderbolt,
which almost before their noise was heard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft
my dear Lady of her senses, who fell en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranced
at the feet of her beloved Spouse, but
our art and care soon recovered her, at which
she seemed somewhat displeased, crying out:
Wherfore do you in vain endeavour to ruin me,
for if that Tongue that gave the wound do not
again give present cure, not all <hi>Esculapius</hi> his
art can reprieve me from death. Alas! my
dear Love (said <hi>Spencer</hi>) arm your self with
patience since I must depart, and endeavour
not to make me forfeit by our passion, my own
and my Countries honour, the Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of a Christian all which are pawn'd for
my return. What will the <hi>Moors</hi> say? and
how justly may they say, That we that are
<hi>Christians</hi> make great boast of Faith, but
they alone do honourable good and vertuous
works.</p>
                           <p>My Mistress, and indeed all of us sate in a
manner intranced to hear <hi>Spencers</hi> Resolution,
and a dull silence had invaded us all, till Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Goodlake</hi> brake it by telling him, That he
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49502:104"/>
would do well to loose us from that labyrinth of
doubts, wherein his discourse had involved us
by a plain discovery of the reasons, that moved
him to this Resolution to return: I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
answered <hi>Spencer,</hi> and there withal rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
what I have already told your Highness,
happened between him and <hi>Ioffer Bassa,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
that if he should leave the life of so
generous a Person, to be sacrified to the fury of
the <hi>Moorish</hi> King, he should for ever be a
Scandal to virtue and goodness; I must confess
(answered <hi>Goodlake</hi>) 't was nobly done of the
<hi>Moor;</hi> but what is the Laws of twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
of those Infidels, to one that is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian:
You have now (said he) Liberty and
free way to your Country, and will you refuse
to take the advantage, that Heaven has lent
you? But as if you scorned their gracious boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
betray both your self and us to voluntary
death, or bondage; leave, leave Sir, this fond
Resolution, and let us make use of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
Gale, which so Smilingly invites us to
Sea. These Arguments were seconded by
<hi>Ruffman,</hi> and my dear Mistress, withal the
perswasions their desires could furnish them
with; My Lady clasping her Arms about the
Neck of her beloved <hi>Spencer,</hi> and crying out,
Oh Sir! do you now then prize my love no
better, then to rate it beneath the friendship
of a Barbarous Moor, or can you to save him,
betray and leave me to an assured death? Can
you thus reward the Pains and Travels I have
undergone for your sake; Alas! (said the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49502:105"/>
generous <hi>Spencer</hi>) do not thus torment me, I
must and will praise my Honour, and the Faith,
and Reputation of a Christian, above whatever
the Earth can yield: Shall <hi>Fesse</hi> report here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,

all other Countries of Christendom, to the

Rules, we will know no pitty for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury

therefore go fetch him forth. Let me

services I have done you, beg of your
Majesty to spare him but some few
hours; still darest thou (said the King)
Capitulate with us, we tell thee once
more that the least delay is death; Then
know mighty Prince (said <hi>Ioffer</hi>) That
he was my Prisoner, and is so still by
promise, for I presuming that such No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

without those other virtues; Faith and
Honour gave him free liberty to go to

before the Sun felt any declension to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the West; Nor do I yet doubt,
but your Majesty will find that Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

                           <p>At that Word my Lady (attended
by the Captain, Lieutenant <hi>Forcet,</hi> and
my self, who never had forsaken her) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
followed her beloved <hi>Spencer,</hi> with
a full resolution to die with him, or for
him; entred the Presence, and falling
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49502:109"/>
down on her knees before the <hi>Moorish</hi>
King; Behold cruel <hi>Mullisheg,</hi> said she, if
thou dost delight in blood, but spare that
of my beloved <hi>Spencer;</hi> and in it's stead
I here present thee mine, and those of all
my Train, to make a flood instead of his
small Rivulet: The generous <hi>Spencer</hi> was
extreamly distracted at our suddain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
and turning to us, all you have
wronged me (said he) above injury, and
how sufficiently to express my just anger,
I know not, for in you I die ten thousand
Deaths, that could otherwise have tasted
but one; and then turning to the <hi>Moor:</hi>
Mighty King, said he, show your self at
least to have somewhat of humanity, by
dismissing these to their Ship, and since
my Life is only forfeit, take but that,
and at my Death, I shall proclaim you
merciful. Oh! no great King (said my
Magnamous Lady,) It were injustice &amp;
not mercy to take his Life, and spare
mine, since what he did was only for my
sake and safety; or if he have committed
any fault (said we altogether) let all our
lives serve as so many victimes to expiate
his Crime, and appease your anger.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49502:110"/>
Alas! you need not plead for death, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<hi>Mullisheg</hi>) you shall all assuredly
die, but especially you treacherous Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
on whom I will execute such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
as shall make future generations
to read it: I came not hither great King
(said <hi>Goodlake</hi>) to be daunted with your
threats, but freely to offer my Life (who
am only guilty) to redeem my friends,
take then this Body and tear it in pieces
with the most exquisite Tortures that the
Savagest <hi>Barbarians</hi> did ever invent? and
spare but the rest, I shall endure them
contentedly. Thou shalt not doubt it,
replied the <hi>Moor;</hi> but villain said he, what
infamous Strumpet was it that thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayedst
to our Royal Bed. For that
Mighty King (said the Queen, who as
well by the several Circumstances, as by
<hi>Ruffmans</hi> Information was confirmed, she
that night enjoyed the King) I must with
your pardon excuse him; for having had
private advice of your designs, I wrought
him to my purpose; nor was it any other
then my self whom you last night em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced.</p>
                           <p>The King was visibly seen to abate
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49502:110"/>
somewhat of his fury at this relation of
the Queens, and began to consider that
the action in the whole contexture of it
was honourable, that he had endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to do wrong, but had not been wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
That his lust had led into a road of
evil actions, where he was riding with a
Carrier, to the loss of that fame which
had once proclaimed him good and just,
that it was time for him now to stop,
which he resolved to do, and therefore
with a smiling countenance looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, he with a generous passion
cried out, shall lust then still have the
prevalency over me? or shall all those
virtuous deeds, for which I have been so
long renowned in <hi>Fesse</hi> be utterly exiled,
shall the Christans still have the honour
to be sole heirs to goodness, and we
<hi>Moors</hi> barbarous and bloody. No (said
he rising up from his Throne, and taking
my Lady by the hand) renowned En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish-woman,
I once more give thee back
to thy Husband, and if he think it no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour,
beg him again to accept of our
grace and favour, and in recompence of
those wrongs we endeavoured to do him,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49502:111"/>
render we will thee such an ample
Dower as shall renown our bounty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
we may but procure your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</p>
                           <p>Thus was all our sorrow turned into
suddain joy, the worthy Captain <hi>Goodlake</hi>
was by the King prised amongst the
Chiefest of his favourites, for his faith
to him, Zeal to the Queen, and constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to his Friends, the generous <hi>Ioffer Bassa</hi>
for his Nobleness to the renowned <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi>
was by the King created Vice-Roy
of <hi>Argiers;</hi> but <hi>Alcade Beigh,</hi> though he
was released from Prison, yet was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
from Court, as a Person who had
encouraged and fomented.</p>
                           <p>Yet for all this, we had some reasons
to fear that <hi>Mullisheg</hi> would again fall
into a Relapse, which made the Noble
<hi>Spencer</hi> earnestly and frequently desire
his leave to visit his own Country; and
he at length being no longer able to deny
him, yielded to his Request; and loading
our Ship with the Richest Commodities
his Kingdom afforded, Himself accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
us aboard, where after some
dayes magnificent Feasting he left us,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49502:111"/>
and we took leave of the <hi>Barbary</hi>
Shore.</p>
                           <p>But the fame of our great Riches was
gone before us into most parts of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom,</hi>
which had made many Pirates
come out on purpose, in hopes to make us
their pray; two dayes after we had been
at Sea, we espyed a great Sail, which
made directly towards us; nor would we
seeing but one Ship alter our Course; or
with addition of Sails endeavour to fly
from her, so she came easily up to us,
and by the roughness of her salute, (for
she immediately powred into us a whole
broad-side) gave us to understand what
she was, and for what intent she came.</p>
                           <p>We had before provided our selves
for resistance, and so soon returned her
courtesy in the same roaring terms; she
had first spoke to us in, but she relying
upon the number of her men, thought it
more advantagious to close with us, then
to fight at distance, which made them
twice resolutely board us, but were both
times most couragiously beaten off by the
vallour of the renowned <hi>Spencer, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lake,
Ruffman, and Forcet,</hi> and at length
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49502:112"/>
so discouraged that <hi>Spencer</hi> and <hi>Goodlake</hi>
hoping to make a Prize of their Assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
armed with their Swords and Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
leaped aboard the <hi>French</hi> Pirat, (for
of that Nation it was,) that before any
could follow to their assistance, the ships
were by a suddain Storm severed, nor
could we withall our art or endeavours
again reach the <hi>French</hi> Ship.</p>
                           <p>I need not tell your Highness what
lamentations my Lady made, to be so
strangely and suddenly deprived (as she
had just cause to fear for ever) of her
worthy Husband. Your Highness hath
seen some effects of her grief, as well as
been informed how that some Storm cast
us upon your Coast, where after we had
escaped the dangers of the Seas, we fell
into the hands of the <hi>Bandetties,</hi> where
we had like to have been robbed of our
honour, a Jewel we prized far above
any the Sea had devoured, had not your
Highness rescued us. Here <hi>Maria</hi> ended,
and the Duke seemed very much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Story; but he was inwardly
displeased at <hi>Spencers</hi> being in his Court,
(for he was confirmed by many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49502:112"/>
it was he,) fearing least his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
should wholly obstruct his love;
he therefore resolved to Cloyster up his
fair Guest, in the most private part of his
Palace; but this being no time to consult
what to do, having presented <hi>Maria</hi> a
Jewel in recompence of her trouble, and
sent by her all commends to his Mistress;
He went to entertain the two Dukes of
<hi>Mantua,</hi> and <hi>Ferrara</hi> who expected
him.</p>

him buried in <hi>Fiall,</hi> and his ashes strowed
in the Air: To which, and such like accents of
comfort, this afflicted Lady would reply, Away
fond fool, and canst thou think then that Pirates
are turned merciful, or that my <hi>Spencers</hi> arm is
able to resist so many hundred villains, who by
continual practize had been inured to blood and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49502:114"/>
cruelty, with the sole assistance of the Noble
<hi>Goodlake;</hi> and yet suppose them to be victors,
we must then suppose them to be left alone in a
wide and almost sinking Vessel, to the mercy
and power of the merciless Seas; O strive not
thus to flatter me with any hopes of his life, but
since he is assuredly and utterly lost, endeavor
not to stop that current of grief, by which onely
the fates have now left me a way to follow
him.</p>
                        <p>Whilest they were one day in a Discourse of
this nature, a noise of the running of horses just
under her window, made <hi>Maria</hi> first, and after
that her Lady look out, the one out of curiosity,
the other to feed her melancholy, rather then
divert it, where they might behold several
Gallants with their Lances in their rests, ready
to run at the Ring; they stood marshalled in
two equal Ranks, which might give the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
to understand, that they were in that sport
Opposites, being twelve in all, whereof six
were chosen by the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and six by
the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> the two Dukes themselves
standing in the head, and ready upon the signal
given, to run the first Carreire in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
which the Judges of the sport (the lots
being drawn who should run first, which fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi>) immediately gave;
and <hi>Ferraras</hi> Duke mounted on a milk-white
Steed, richly caparisoned, and shining with
Gold and Pearl, himself clad in a Suite of sky
colour Damask, imbroydered with many cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
flowers and fancies, with a large feather
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49502:115"/>
of the same colour in his hat, advanced to the
place from whence he was to begin his course,
where weaving his Lance thrice over his head,
in token of challenge to <hi>Mantuas</hi> Duke, he set
spurs to his horse, and with a gentle and easie
Carreir, took the Ring with so much dexterity,
as was admirable to the Spectators. The Duke
of <hi>Mantua</hi> who had beheld the good success of
his adversary, next fitted himself for the course,
and issuing from before those Cavaliers his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutants
(mounted on a Dapple-gray Steed, that
Heaven-resembling colour, his caparison as well
as his habit, being all composed of green silk,
imbellished here and there with a resplendant
Diamond) he came to the place appointed,
where waving likewise his Lance three times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his head, made his course, in the midst of
which his horse being somewhat too fiery, gave
several bounds, which made not only the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
spectators, but even those Cavaliers who
were of his part, fear that he would miss the
Ring, but he finding it must be done by a quick
motion, by reason of his Steeds unruliness, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
spurs to his horse, took it with so fierce a
Carreir, that many, though they saw it upon
the point of his Lance, doubted whether he had
it or no. The next who run were the Count <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo
Bentivoglio,</hi> on the part of the Duke of
<hi>Ferrara,</hi> and the Marquis of <hi>Mirandola,</hi> on the
Duke of <hi>Mantuas,</hi> who both having performed
their course with admirable agility, were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by the Conte of <hi>Villa Corta,</hi> on the part of
<hi>Ferrara,</hi> who having missed the Ring with the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49502:115"/>
point of his Lance, very dexterously let it fall,
and drawing out his sword took it at its point,
to the no little wonder of the spectators. He was
followed by the Cavalier <hi>Iacomo Amadei,</hi> who
notwithstanding his horse, as he almost came to
the end of the course, seemed to stumble, and
indeed in a maner to fall, yet he took the Ring
with an excellent dexterity. The Cavalier <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonso
Bernardi,</hi> and the Cavalier <hi>Thomaso Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dico,</hi>
both performed their courses with applause;
but <hi>Girolamo Picolhomini,</hi> and <hi>Fernando Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,</hi>
who followed them, both missed the Ring,
yet received no less shouts from the spectators,
then those which had performed best, though I
suppose they were not at all pleased with them.
The Count of St. <hi>Severino</hi> was the next, who ran
on the Duke of <hi>Ferrara's</hi> side, who deservedly
gained the applause, not onely of the specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
but all the Noble Actors; he was followed
by that renowned Cavalier <hi>Giovanne del Monte,</hi>
who to his great vexation, was this day most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate;
for after he had made a most grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
course, and was now ready to take the Ring,
his girts broke, and his horse withall giving a
bound, both himself and saddle came to the
ground; But now appeared on the part of the
Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> a person, which made <hi>Maria</hi>
recal her Mistris to the window, at least to show
her a person who resembled her lost <hi>Spencer;</hi>
she, though somewhat unwillingly, came to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
him, but having looked upon him, she im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
fell into a swoon, whether overpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with joy, believing it to be her beloved
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49502:116"/>
                           <hi>Spencer,</hi> or with grief, at seeing so near a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of her lost Spouse: <hi>Maria</hi> endeavoured
by all means possible to recover her, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this accident, was hindred from making
a farther discovery, though she was absolutely
confirmed that it was the generous <hi>Spencer</hi> (as
indeed it was) both by a little green scarf which
he wore upon his left arm, a badge her Lady had
given him at his first going to <hi>Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ll,</hi> as likewise
by a person whom she judged to be <hi>Goodlake,</hi>
and whom, had not her Ladies weakness hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
her, she would have found some means to
have spoken to, but her faintness increasing,
she was forced to retire with her.</p>
                        <p>The generous <hi>Spencer</hi> was this day of sport
and triumph, as he had ever been since his forced
separation from his beloved Spouse, cloathed all
in black, nothing of any other colour appearing
about him save onely the small green Scarf, but
the extraordinary grace wherewith he sate on
horseback, and dexterity wherewith he took
the Ring, put the whole Company that view'd
him into admiration: not was it performed
with less skill and gallantry by Captain <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lake,</hi>
who was the last that ran on the part of
the Duke of <hi>Mantua;</hi> yet was the Victory given
by the Judges of the field to the Duke of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi>'s
side, because of the misfortune which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to the Cavalier <hi>Giovanne del Monte,</hi> who
thereby mist the Ring.</p>
                        <p>Yet all persons were well contented, and so
accompanied the Grand Duke to his Palace,
where a sumptuous and magnificent Feast was
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49502:116"/>
prepared for them at which the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi>
did more observe <hi>Spencer</hi> then ever he had done
before, and both by his reserved melancholy,
and mourning weeds, but especially by his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
countenance and actions, concluded him
infallibly to be the Spouse of his fair Guest, and
<hi>Goodlake</hi> undeniable the same person who was
Captain of the <hi>Negro,</hi> yet he resolved absolutely
to detain these two Lovers from the knowledge
of each others safety, till such time as he had
attempted all ways for the gaining of the Love
of his beautous Guest, which he was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by continual solicitations to endeavor to
do, and thought all time tedious which he did
not spend in her company, resolving as soon as
he could with civility leave the two Dukes, to
visit her.</p>
                        <p>We left her in a swoond at the sight of her
beloved <hi>Spencer,</hi> from which being by the care
of her maid <hi>Maria</hi> revived, clasping her in her
arms with a fervent embrace (scarce knowing
where she was) And is my <hi>Spencer</hi> yet alive,
said she, or art thou but his shadow? Alas!
Madam, said <hi>Maria,</hi> I am neither your <hi>Spencer,</hi>
nor his shadow, but this I dare assure you, that
both he and Captain <hi>Goodlake</hi> are alive, and at
present in this Court, and much I am mistaken
if <hi>Rufman</hi> were not there likewise to see their
justing. Oh me! said her Lady, what a dream
have thou and I been in. A dream Madam, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
she, certain I am that both my eyes were
open, and all the faculties of my soul awake,
when I beheld your generous <hi>Spencer</hi> with a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49502:117"/>
grace admired by all, take the Ring, and him
followed by the valiant <hi>Goodlake;</hi> nor do I
doubt Madam in few days but to finde an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to assure him of your safety, for I can
perceive both by his dejected countenance, and
sable habit, that he as much mourns your sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
loss, as you do his. But dost thou then
think it possible, said she, that the Gods should
be yet so favorable to me, as to preserve my
<hi>Spencer</hi> both from the fury of the Pyrates, and
the Seas? Madam, the fates could not, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Maria,</hi> be so unjust as to deprive you utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of him for whom they had made you endure
so many strange and adverse fortunes, and run
through so many perilous adventures, therefore
cheer up your Spirits with an assurance that your
<hi>Spencer</hi> lives, and that you shall again within
few dayes enjoy him.</p>
                        <p>In this Discourse was the beautous <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betha,</hi>
and her maid <hi>Maria,</hi> when the Grand
Duke entred her lodgings, and perceiving in
her countenance somewhat more alacrity then
usually, he began to hope that time would wear
away her melancholy, not at all dreaming that
she had made any discovery of the safety of her
Love, or his being in that Court; he therefore
accosted her with many Obliging and Amorous
expressions. To all which she returned in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That the Vows she had made to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Spencer,</hi> were not yet, not ever should be
cancelled in her brest. You wrong both your
self, and your beauty Madam, said the Duke, to
dote upon a thing that is not, for though I were
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49502:117"/>
not fully sensible of the cruelty of the <hi>French</hi>
Nation, especially of the Pirates of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet I cannot believe that a sinking Vessel
could escape that storm, wherein yours, which
was a sound one, perished; and though it may
be alledged, that they might likewise escape the
furies of the Sea; yet it is rather to be supposed
that the <hi>French</hi> ship perished in the vast Ocean,
rather then that it was driven nigh any shore
that might preserve them: Aflict not then your
self Madam, continued he, with a vain hopes
of that which can never be obtained, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
not at what the gods have done for your
greater benefit. If the gods, answered she,
have been so unjust as to deprive me utterly of
my <hi>Spencer,</hi> yet I will, nor cannot be so unjust to
his memory, as so soon to blot out the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of our Loves, even before I can be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
whether the fates have been so unmerciful
as to deprive me of him or no; not do I know
whether it would savor more of levity in me, to
entertain another Lover before I was surely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
I had lost him; or of cruelty in the
deities to part two such constant Lovers as we
have hitherto been.</p>
                        <p>The Duke was about to have returned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
and to continue his perswasions, when one
of his Pages entred to acquaint him that a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger
pretending weighty affairs attended for
Audience, which made the Duke for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
though unwillingly, leave his Mistris, till
he could have some fitter time to prosecute his
desires.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="154" facs="tcp:49502:118"/>Being come into the presence, the Messenger
on his knees presented his Highness with letters,
which he opening found to be from his Admiral
<hi>Pedro de Venturo,</hi> giving him advice of a great
victory obtained by him, against the Vice-roy of
<hi>Argiers,</hi> who had long infested those Seas with
a great Fleet both of Ships and Gallies. The
Messenger farther by word of mouth acquainted
his Highness, that Signieur <hi>Pedro Venturo</hi> was
coming himself with the Vice-Roy his prisoner,
to lay his whole conquest at his feet, that there
were likewise several Christian captives whom
he had released, who were coming after to present
themselves to his Highness, and that by reason
of an accident which befell his horse, he once
feared the Admiral would have arrived as soon
as he, if not before him.</p>
                        <p>The grand Duke was extreamly rejoyced at
this victory, against the common enemy of
<hi>Christendom,</hi> and immediately sent to acquaint
the two Dukes of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Ferrara</hi> with it,
who accompanied with a great retinue of nobles,
made all haste possible into the great Hall of the
Palace, to entertain the victorious Admiral, who
soon after arrived, and was received with all
those expressions of joy and respect, which could
proceed from a loving Prince to a deserving
Subject.</p>
                        <p>Usual complements being past, the grand
Duke commanded <hi>Venturo</hi> to relate the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his fight, and how he obtained that sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
victory, and the noble Admiral having
composed himself, his countenance to a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49502:118"/>
which would become the telling of a story,
which must in some part Eccho out his own
praise, thus began.</p>
                        <p>Your Highness, (and I think all here present)
very well knows that the Potent <hi>Mullisheg</hi> King
of <hi>Fess</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> after he had by a long and
tedious civil war, taken prisoners his two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who had strove with him for the Royal
Scepter, and caused them to be put to death,
having setled those two Crowns upon his own
head without any fear of competition, made
many threatnings to annoy the <hi>Christians</hi> whose,
sworn enemy his Religion makes him, which
threats he not long since put in execution by
commanding this noble <hi>Bassa,</hi> (for he wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>thily
deserves that attribute) whom he had some time
before created <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> of <hi>Argiers,</hi> with a
Fleet of twelve Gallies to scour the Seas, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
our coasts, make prize of our Ships and
goods, and inslave our persons.</p>
                        <p>And though this <hi>Bassa</hi> executed his commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
with all mildness possible, and with a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
rather becoming a <hi>Christian,</hi> then a <hi>Moor,</hi>
restoring many whom he had made prize of to
their liberties, and some to their goods; yet the
tyrannies which were acted by some who were
Commanders under him, or rather spyes over
him, and who ill resented those favors he so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
showed to the <hi>Christians,</hi> were too great for
to comport, which made your Highness with
Sixteen Gallies command me to clear our Seas
and Coasts from their pyracies; which I hope I
have effected in so short a time, that your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49502:119"/>
will not repine at the expence you have
been at for the general good of <hi>Christendom.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I was not fully a fortnight at Sea, but it was
my fortune to espy the <hi>Moresco</hi> Kings whole
Fleet, under the command of this gallant <hi>Bassa,</hi>
we immediately hoysed all our syal to make up
to them; Nor did they endeavor to shun us,
but standing up towards us, we expected a sharp
fight: but nine of his Gallies, whether terrified
by our numbers and valour, or their own co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
fear, immediately yielded to us; two of
the other after some resistance, were brought to
obedience, but the Admirals Galley though she
were assaulted by at least six of our Gallies, at
once, made a resolute resistance; encouraged,
or indeed acted by the sole valour of this brave
man, who did such wonders as I am almost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to acknowledge, or recount before him,
I was enraged that after the yielding of eleven,
one gally, because she was the <hi>Admiral,</hi> as if
the others had infused all their spirit into her,
should make so gallant a resistance, and that
onely by the sole valour and prowess of her
Captain; and therefore clapping her aboard,
I entered her in person, which I had no sooner
done, but this generous <hi>Bassa</hi> accosted me, and
presenting me the pommel of his sword, told
me, That it was neither desperation nor hopes
to escape that had been the cause of his making
so obstinate a resistance against so great odds; but
because, being an <hi>Admiral</hi> himself, he scorned
to yield to any other then the <hi>Admiral.</hi> I knew
not how to return an answer suitable to his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49502:119"/>
nor was there any thing could have
quitted so much worth, but an immediate resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his liberty, which not daring of my self
to do, I here humbly present him, and my self
thus low at your Highness feet.</p>
                        <p>The Renowned <hi>Spencer</hi> had all the while that
the Cavalier <hi>Pedro Venturo</hi> had been relating
this story, fixed his eyes upon the worthy <hi>Bassa,</hi>
and no sooner had he finshed to speak, but run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to him and imbracing him, cried out, <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Ioffer Bassa,</hi> and is it possible that fortune
should be adverse to cast down so gallant a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
I shall be inforced indeed hencesorth to
account her blind, and like a Courtier not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarding
deserts or merit. Then kneeling to the
grand Duke, mighty Prince, continued he, did
you know the worth that flows in these black
veines, you would not onely send him ransome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to his country, but honor him, and if (said
he) I have merrited any thing from these two
Dukes, (meaning <hi>Mantoua</hi> and <hi>Ferrara</hi>) let me
beg them to be my intercessors that I may pay
his ransome, and if all I have amount not to
what great <hi>Florence</hi> may expect, I'le leave my
self in hostage. The grand Duke remembredhis
excellent Generosity towards the gallant <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi>
was very ready to comply with his desires,
(though he would not yet seem to know him
for that worthy person,) which he sufficiently
manifested by telling him, Noble English-man
so much is all <hi>Italy</hi> beholding to you, for recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
these two Dukes, in whose peace all the
Princes of this country are so much concerned,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:49502:120"/>
that I should very ill quit the obligation you
have laid upon our country, if I should not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with your desires, your friendship to him is
his ransome, which if you will likewise bless us
with, we all account it better then Myriads of
gold. Go noble <hi>Bassa,</hi> now no more a prisoner,
at pleasure return to thy country. The joy which
the generous <hi>Spencer</hi> conceived for this free
grant of the <hi>Thusean</hi> Dukes, made him forget
to return a thanks due to so great a favour: But
running again to the <hi>Bassa</hi> and embracing him,
noble <hi>Ioffer</hi> said he, thou savior of my life, and
of a life I prize above ten thousand of my own,
how happy am I that I can in some part renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate
thy kindness, yet this freedom I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
thee cannot half renumerate thy worth. Sir,
(answered the <hi>Bassa</hi>) even slavery it self had
been welcome to me, if I might but therewith
have enjoyed your sight and presence, which I
had resolved to search all over the world for, and
rather then not obtain, have hazarded the breach
of a rash and foolish oath I once made, of never
more returning into my native country. Your
native country (said <hi>Spencer,</hi>) are you not then
a native of <hi>Barbery?</hi> I must confess I ever doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that such nobleness could not reside in any
of that rude, and illiterate Nation: Oh Sir (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
the <hi>Bassa,</hi> I have things yet to tell you,
which will make you yet hate me; It is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
(said <hi>Spencer,</hi>) I must first hate my self, and
my own life sooner then the noble preserver of
it. I will now then (said the <hi>Bassa</hi>) no longer
conceal my self, but if you can receive a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49502:120"/>
who hath long since forfeited both yours,
and his fathers affection, embrace me, this black
is like a veil to cover my former miscarriages,
which being once washed off, I shall appear like
my first self. Not onely the worthy <hi>Spencer,</hi> but
the Dukes, and the whole presence were asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
at these words of the <hi>Bassas,</hi> they all
not knowing what to say, or how to believe
what he had uttered, the worthy <hi>Spencer</hi> had
fixed an eye of amazement upon his face, where
though the black still remained, he began to
espy some symptomes of his brothers physiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
whilest the <hi>Bassa</hi> seeing his and all their
wonder, thus continued; Sir, I shall not onely
by taking away this Moorish hew, clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
you, I am your Brother, but give you like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
such infallible circumstances, as shall
make you not able to deny it; nor think that
though I have changed my colour, I have withall
changed my Religion, for I protest before Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
I never was yet guilty of receiving into my
bosom the least Turkish Tenent; but perhaps
your doubt and wonder may as much accrue
from my not discovering my self before, but
when you have heard my reasons to the contrary,
you will rest satisfied; in the mean time, let
me beg some respite of these Princes to redeem
my native hue, and I shall soon return like my
first self. The Duke easily granted him that
liberty, and withal gave order, that he should
out of his Wardrobe be furnished with befitting
Christian apparel.</p>
                        <p>The whole presence was left in great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:49502:121"/>
at this strange adventure, being unwilling
to believe what they yet did believe; but at
the return of the <hi>Bassa</hi> (for we shall still so call
him) their wonder not onely increased to see
him so soon changed from a deep black, into a
pure white complexion, but to observe the great
similitude which was between him and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<hi>Spencer,</hi> the same majesty and gallantry
appeared in both their Countenances, with a
kinde of pleasing affability, which was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
less in the <hi>Bassa</hi> who was the elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and whose visage inclined somewhat more
to fierceness than that of the generous <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To relate the several Embraces and obliging
Expressions, which passed between these two
brothers, would be an <hi>Herculean</hi> labor; the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Spencer</hi> with tears in his eyes welcomed into
his bosom his long-lost brother, whom he had
many years since accounted dead. The several
Congratulations of <hi>Goodlake, Ruffman,</hi> and others
would take up a Volume to recite them: the
Dukes themselvs descending from their thrones,
embraced this new-found <hi>Christian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After all these Complements and Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
had past, which could be expected from
two Brothers which had been long lost to one
another: The Grand Duke's earnest desire to
hear the story of this renowned <hi>Bassa,</hi> made him
importunate in desiring him to give him and the
other Duke, a brief Relation of it; which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

HISTORY
Of the Famous
JOFFER BASSA.</head>
                           <p>AFter I was (said he with the tears almost
gushing out of his eyes) by my fathers
too much provoked anger banished out of his
sight, and wholy dis-inherited of his Estate,
armed with disdain, and dispair, (the last a plague
and punishment incident to rebellions against
Parents) I resolved to go seek that fortune in
other Countries, which his just resentments
had denied me in my own; and indeed shame
as well as necessity enforced me to take this
course, for I had not onely tired out my fathers
patience, but all those friends whom I had
too often imployed to make my peace with
him. Gathering therefore up some few debts,
which my riot had before scattered amongst my
dissolute companions, I embarqued my self upon
a ship bound for <hi>Civita Vechia,</hi> the chief Port-Town
of the <hi>Papacy</hi> towards the <hi>Tyrhene</hi> Sea;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:49502:122"/>
intending to finde my self imployment in those
Wars, which had some time before broken out
between the Church, and your Highness renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
father, <hi>Cosino de Medices,</hi> Grand Duke of
<hi>Tuscany.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But as if Fortune now having me in her
clutches, had resolved to inflict a punishment
upon me, equal to my former miscarriages; we
were no sooner past the Streits of <hi>Gibralter,</hi> and
sailing thence with a prosperous gale towards out
intended Ports, but we espied three Turkish
Men-of-war, belonging to the King of <hi>Tunis</hi>
who gave chase to our poor Ba que: 'tis true we
could see little hopes in making any resistance,
yet the fear I had to be a slave, and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
I was in never to be redeemed, made me
encourage the Captain to fight; but no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of mine, or desires of many of his Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
could make his coward minde admit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it any other tearms but those of yielding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

it out.</p>
                           <p>But the major part resolving to fight, and
like generous souls, being willing rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
death then slavery, we resolved that since
our Captain would not be perswaded to combate
them, either to force him to it, or secure him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the last of which we had scarcely finished to do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and put our selves in order, but the first of the
Pirates came up to us, and having given us
rough salute, presently clapt us aboard; bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>
                              <pb n="163" facs="tcp:49502:122"/>
such was our resolution, that before either of
the other two could come up to us, we had
twice beaten them off our decks, and were ready
to enter theirs, and in all probability to have
made a Prize of those who endeavored to prey
upon us, when we were prevented by the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
assault of the second of the Pirates, a ship
of greater force then the first that had a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>tacqued
us, yet we for some time likewise obstinately
defended our selves against them, till the third
coming up to their assistance, we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to yield to their power and numbers.</p>
                           <p>Nothing could be more grievous to me then
thus to become a slave, yet my adverse fates
would not admit me to prevent it; for I once
endeavored to have pierced my own heart with
my Poynard, but was hindred by the covetous
Turks, who intended to make money of my
person, and the very thought of being to be
sold in the market like a bruit beast, made me
so desperate, that I should have accounted the
blood of Asps and Vipers, to have been a healing
and sanative potion.</p>
                           <p>But of all means of freeing my self from sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
by a voluntary death, I was deprived by
being closely chained up amongst the rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the hatches, and so close were we toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that if we had strove to finde out a death,
it must have been no other then the knocking of
our brains out one against another; but that
which somewhat comforted me, was to see our
coward Captain in as bad condition as my
self, or indeed worse if possible could be, for
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:49502:123"/>
he being placed in the midst of us was forced,
endured not onely the reproaches, but the buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
of his own men for his cowardize; five days
continued we in this condition, fed with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a few scraps of bisquet, and stinking
water, which made me with tears begin to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
my self of that good and noble condition,
out of which I had by my own folly and wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thrown my self.</p>
                           <p>Being arrived at <hi>Tunis,</hi> we were immediately
carried on shore, and with our chains about our
legs, brought into the publique Bazar, where it
was my fortune to be sold to an old Beldam,
who employed me in nothing else but to fetch
her water, scoure her dishes, and other the
most servile drudgery, being continually sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the flouts, mocks, and blows, of her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious
son; who had so much incensed me,
that I once resolved to have executed a severe
revenge upon him long before I did it, and
thereby with the enduring of a little torture, to
have freed my self from a lasting misery, for I
could imagine no way to escape, but my stars had
yet for me in store a better fate, and intended
to punish me, not to destroy me; for so it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
that my Beldame had some time before
me bought into her house to do her private ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
a little female Jew, with whom in short
time I had grown so familiar, that I could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
in her some love towards me, for she would
often assist me in performing those servile works
which were daily imposed; and many times
would we sit together seriously lamenting our
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:49502:123"/>
misfortunes, and belching out curses against
our young Patron, who was equally insolent
to both.</p>
                           <p>One day as I was brushing and cleansing some
of <hi>Osmans</hi> clothes, for so was the old womans
son called, she came to me all bloody and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably
crying, she sat down in a most melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
desperate posture by me, I need not ask
her from whence her affliction derived, for I had
often my self had experience of it; but turning
to her, must we always, said I, be inslaved to
this misery, and be subject to the insolencies
of this yound dog, without revenge? That word
revenge, revived her out of her pensive drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses:
If thou canst be faithful, said she, and
hast but valor enough to effect it, let me alone
to invent a way for both our escapes. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible,
replied I, that ever we can pass the
Ports. It is true, answered she, as we are it is,
but I have an Art to compose a Juyce, which
shall turn us in two houres space more black
then the Sun-burnt <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> by which means
we shall escape the fury of our Patroness, and
certainly we cannot fall into deeper miseries,
then are now overwhelmed. Do but that, said I,
and assure your self of a full revenge. But thou
shalt first promise me, (said <hi>Iosina,</hi> for so she was
called) thet thou wilt not forsake me, for, said
she, (rising up and embracing me) though I am
like thee a slave here, yet I am of noble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
nor has my beauty, except my friends, and
those of my own Nation, flattered me, been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
despicable; nor indeed was it, for she
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49502:124"/>
was admirable fair, and had she not been so, I
was willing to embrace any thing to procure my
liberty; so I swore to her by all Oaths imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that I would never leave her: she now felt
not her blows, which had before half slain her,
but nimbly went about to provide the promised
Juyce, which I had not faith enough to credit,
till I had found by experience, that being easily
laid on it, turned out skins to a <hi>Mauri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>anian</hi>
hew, and that nothing but Wine Vinegar
could remove it; she having thus performed her
part, she pressed me to act mine, which I had
within three days opportunity given me to do,
for the old Beldam having sent me to fetch her
some water from a Spring about two miles off,
for her own drinking, I in my way encountred
<hi>Osman,</hi> who far from his usual maner, began fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>iarly
to discourse with me, and accompanied
me as far as the Wels; this strange alteration
of his, had almost made me alter my purpose,
but knowing it was at present but feigned, and
would break out afterwards into greater storms,
I resolved to execute it, and hopes of gaining
my liberty, giving a double strength to my arm,
I stept unto him, and snatching out his sword, and
withall turning of his Turban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>, without giving
him leave to speak, at one blow I stroke him to
the ground, assured of his ever rising again till
the day of Judgement.</p>
                           <p>My revenge thus happily effected, I covered
his body slightly with sand, and thrusting his
Scimitar under my slaves coat, hastened home
with my water, which having delivered to my
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:49502:124"/>
old patroness, I made as much haste to acquaint
<hi>Iosina</hi> with what I had done, and showing her
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>word as a testimony of it, she so rejoyced as
I cannot tell well how to express, the night drew
on which was propitious to our designs, for he
using seldom to come home, was not at all
search't for, and we had the opportunity by the
privacy of it to colour our selves, which we
soon effected, each mutually helping each other,
though with as much modesty as we could: I
confess it grieved me to lay that black hue upon
her white and angel like skin; but the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of liberty made all things sweet. About
two hours before day, we issued out of the old
Beldams house, taking all the moneys we could
finde in it, but not medling with any thing else
lest it should betray us; and both of us speaking
the language well, we came into a Cane or Inne
in the town, as travellers newly come out of the
country, which we might well do so early in the
morning, it being the custom of those countries
to travel altogether by night.</p>
                           <p>To remove suspect, though it was impossible
for any one to know us, according to the usual
manner, we no sooner came into the Inn, but
we laid our selves down to repose, both in one
Chamber, but at a modest distance, but scarce
had we slept three hours, but we were awakened
by the noyse in the Inn, made by the Officers
of Justice come in search of us; we were about
to rise, and be as inquisitive as others what the
business was, but as we were about to do so, the
Officers entred our Chamber, and seeing none
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49502:125"/>
but us two Blacks, as they supposed, as soon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted;
we asked some <hi>Moors</hi> what the matter
was? Who told us, that <hi>Osman Chellabee</hi> was
murthered by his mothers slaves, who being fled
upon it, they were now in search of them.</p>
                           <p>All things being again quieted in that Cane,
and the Officers gone to search in some other,
we called for some repast, and were very jocund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
merry at our so cleanly escape; but in the
middest of our mirth, it was, I cannot tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our good or ill fortune to remember, that
we had left our spunges with a bowl of the juice
which had dyed our skins at home, and though
we imagined, that at first sight they could not
tell what to make of it, yet we thought some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
might discover for what intention it was:
This suddainly changed all our mirth into sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
we could not a good while resolve what to
do; but at length our own safety prompted us
immediately to leave the town before our arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
should be discovered, for though the gates
upon this murther were securely watcht, that no
<hi>Christian</hi> slave should pass, yet those of our
complexion might have free Egress and Regress.</p>
                           <p>We passed therefore forth of that gate, which
leads towards <hi>Argiers,</hi> choosing to go thither,
both because <hi>Iosina</hi> having past and repast that
way, was acquainted with it, and also because
we might there securely change our complexions,
and so finde some <hi>Christian</hi> ship to transport us
to this blessed shore.</p>
                           <p>Our feet had before been surbated with labor,
so travel was not tedious to us, and our poor out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:49502:125"/>
secured us from theeves, for we had scarce
more cloth, then would cover our nakedness,
though I had neer two hundred checqueens tied
in a girdle about my waste, so that we feared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but wild beasts, which often in those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
assault. Most of our discourse to shorten
the time, was about our difference in religion,
and unto so good a conceit had I brought <hi>Iosina</hi>
of our belief, that she promised me if I would
carry her into <hi>Christendom</hi> she would forsake her
Religion, for parents, friends, and kindred she
had none living, for me and my faith.</p>
                           <p>Thus travayled we with all imaginable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
till we came to the large<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>and spacious for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
of <hi>Albemquel,</hi> which spreads it self over
nine mountains, but hath no other inhabitant's
besides Lions, Tigers, Wolves, Bears, and other
beasts of prey, and those in no small quantity:
one days journy had we made through this diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Arbory, and were now proceeding onwards
on the next, when about noon my <hi>Iosina,</hi> for my
heart now bids me call her so) being somewhat
faint through the extream heat, we sat to shade
and rest our selves under a large spreading syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
(which in those countries bears a wild fig,
much eaten by the <hi>Moors</hi>) and the fruit being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
ripe, I, though unwillingly consented to by
<hi>Iosina,</hi> mounted the tree to gather her some, when
being on top and thick leaves shading me from
all sight, I might on the suddain hear a rushing
among the leaves below, and withal a great
feminine shreike; I descended withal the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
possible, but when I came down I found
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:49502:126"/>
her not there, nor could I imagine which way
she had taken: heavens! into what a passion
was I cast? I easily determined her devoured
by some wild beast, and for her sake vow'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
upon all those in the forest; therefore
snatching up my dart, which I stuck at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the tree, I took that way which my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
had directed me to, hoping either to finde
her, or at least some remains of her; but having
three days sought in vain, I was constrained by
hunger to seek my way out of the wood, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the directions of the declining Sun, I past
with much trouble through those thick brakes,
for I could not again finde the road.</p>
                           <p>But having travayled thus one whole day,
night coming on, fearing to loose what I had
before got towards my way out, made me ascend
a tree to repose me, but the next morning I
found my self so faint through hunger and thirst,
that I was scarce able to descend: but with
much pains being got down, I had not walked
far, but I was assaulted by a hunger-starved bear,
who with open mouth assured himself of a prey,
and I confess I almost assured my self I should
be so to him, for such was my weakness that I
found my self almost incapable of resistance; but
summoning up all my spirits, I with both hands
reared up my dart, and as he mounted up his two
hinder feet to seize me, smote him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> on the brest,
and found an easier passage to his heart then I
expected; his death two ways afforded me life,
for I not onely escaped becomming a prey to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:49502:126"/>
him, but with his blood somewhat asswaged my
violent hunger and thirst.</p>
                           <p>That day brought me out of the forrest, into a
large sandy desert, where I resolved still to take
the Sun for my guide in the day, and the Stars in
the night; yet now I began to think I should
wander eternally, for all that night and the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
day I could meet with neither man, or
habitation, nor yet wild beast; but more then the
tedious of my travel, did the loss of my dear <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sina</hi>
affict me, though I suffered all the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
of thirst and hunger, yet was my
mind more tormented for her death (for so I
supposed it,) then my body for want of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries:
it length utterly wearied I laid my self
down upon the ground when by an <hi>Eccho</hi> through
the hollow veins of the earth, I might hear
strange and confused noyses, this made me yet
more attentively listen, when at length I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
it to be the sound of martial instruments
not far distant, and somewhat revived hope to
finde some rational creatures, for I had for many
days conversed with no other then beasts of
prey. I roused up my spirits, and clambring up a
steep hill which lay before me, I might in the
large plain on the other side behold a mighty
Army which seemed in a readiness to expect
their foes, who appeared on the tops of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermost
hills.</p>
                           <p>Though I doubted I should at my approach
to them be taken by them for a spy, yet my hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
constrained me to adventure down, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come to their Out-guards, I was immediately
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:49502:127"/>
seized upon, and brought before the mighty
<hi>Mullisheg</hi> King of <hi>Fess</hi> and <hi>Morocco;</hi> for his
Army it was, which he had raised to oppose his
rebeltious brothers, who having strictly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
me, was so far from thinking me a spy, that
he demanded of me if I would serve him in his
wars, and I readily assenting to do it, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
by I know not what genius, caused me
to be listed in his own horse guard.</p>
                           <p>The opposite Army under the command of
<hi>Muley Xeriff,</hi> stayd for some days longer on the
tops of the mountains, nor could any provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
draw him from his fastnesses; where it is
to be supposed he resided in, expecting the other
brother <hi>Muley Hamet</hi> to come and joyn with
him; for no sooner was he a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

descended into the Plain, with an Army of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
fourscore thousand men, our whole force
consisting of not above forty thousand foot, and
twenty five thousand horse.</p>
                           <p>The night before the fatal battel, both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
encamped within the reach of each others
Artillery, which played furiously whilst there
appeared any twinkling of light, but night ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
covered the earth with her black man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>el,
both sides lay still till the morning-star showed
them again in Arms, and after the Artillery had
for some time thundred out death and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the two brothers advanced towards us in a
gallant Equipage; nor did we receive them
with a resolution any thing unequal to theirs,
though I must confess that we were forced to
give a little ground to the fury of their first
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49502:127"/>
charge, yet that loss proved to our Advantage:
In sum, the battel continved doubtful till about
noon, when <hi>Muley Xeriff</hi> with a select party
broke into the Kings guards, and had neer taken
the great <hi>Mullisheg</hi> prisoner, or deprived him of
life, had not my better stars guided me to his
rescue.</p>
                           <p>Having set the King safe, and received from
him innumerable thanks and promises of reward,
I returned again to the almost broken guards,
and encouraging them the best I could, come
(said I to party who had seen me rescue the King,
and had there-upon protested to follow me
wheresoever I would lead them,) let us fetch
this Traytor from amongst the midst of his rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
troops, I was gallantly seconded by about
a hundred of them, who gave so resolute a
charge that we soon made way through those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
victorious troops, and came to the place
where <hi>Xeriff</hi> was; him guided by fortune I sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
out, and soon brought him under the power
of my sword, Heavens! How did the great
<hi>Mullisheg</hi> embrace me when I presented him at
his feet: As for him he caused his head to be
immediately cut off, and being set upon a lance
to be carried up and down the Army, which
struck such a terror into the Rebels, that they
immediately threw down their Arms and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or else trusted to their heels for their safety.
<hi>Muley Hamet</hi> with three thousand horse escaped
the fury of the field, and fled towards the plains,
but so totally was the Army routed, that he had
little hopes of rallying them for to try another
encounter.</p>

he no sooner perceiving us pursuing him with
so great a power, but hoping to escape into a
Wood not far distant, he struck out of the way
from the rest towards it; he was easily known
by those Guides that accompanied me, who told
me that if he gained that Wood, it would be

about to tell him, that I had strict command
from <hi>Mullisheg</hi> to bring him alive; when he
guessing by my delays that I would not answer
his desires, with his own sword pierced his
heart.</p>
                           <p>I could not but both pity and commend the
resolution of this generous Prince, and was
standing amazed at the Magnanimity and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
of the Action, when the whole body of
Horse came up, the chief Commanders of which
advised me to carry his body to the King, to
assure him of his death, which I gave order to
be done: and the Moorish King having first
embraced me, and given me a million of thanks,
and withal put a very rich Jewel about my
neck, seemed somewhat to lament his death,
giving order for his being buried like a Prince,
which made me believe that he would have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his life, the rather because he was drawn
into this Rebellion, more by cunning Artifices
of his brother, than by any inclination of his

conferred upon me, were envied by old <hi>Muly

to bring me into some disgrace.</p>
                           <p>But the King favor to me out-lasted his life,
for he died soon after, and still rather increased

my being a Christian, I had forfeited both my
Honors and my Life, and feign I was, lest my

very melancholy, considering of, and repining
at the injustice of the gods, to deprive me of

no sooner had the darkness of the Night shut
up the Day, but the Messenger conducted me
to the place where she resided: but heavens!
how was I extasied at the sight of her! if her
beauties pleased me before, they now ravished
me; I had seen her before in the habit of a
slave, but now of a Princess. I stood rather
like an <hi>inanimate Statua</hi> than a moving soul, and
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49502:130"/>
like one that could not tell whether I were
moved with Admiration or Love; imposible
indeed it will be to relate the passions of
either of us at this meeting, or for any to
guess what they were, but those that feel them;
we soon renewed our former Loves, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
amongst other Discourse she told me,
that though I had used such perswasive Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to make her change her Religion, as had
overcome her, yet she feared I had now for
momentary Honor, changed mine for a worse
than that which she before professed: But I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
her, and made her easily believe the
contrary. In summe, we concluded to invent
some way of getting both into <hi>Christendom,</hi>
which yet we resolved to deferre, till those
Gallies appointed for me to scour the Seas were
in readiness, for they were then preparing;
and indeed I should have embarqued with my
Brother on his <hi>Negro,</hi> rather than have made
him run so deep a resigo of his life, but that I
should then have left behinde me my Dear <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sina.</hi>

                           <p>At last the Gallies being ready, I put to
Sea, having privately got <hi>Iosina</hi> aboard, and
could I have found an opportunity, would
often have stole from the rest of the Fleet, but
there was so much danger in it, that it was a
desperation to attempt it. At length hearing
that your Highness Fleet was out at Sea, I had
so tampered with Nine of the Captains, that
they promised to yield (and turn Christians)
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49502:131"/>
at the first sight of your Fleet, which I long
sought our for, and at length fortunately found;
and lest you should wonder why my self made
resistance, know that a boysterous soldier lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
violent hands upon my beloved <hi>Iosina,</hi> I
could do no less then give him the due reward
of his insolence, which others of his fellows en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring
to revenge, I was forced to defend
my self.</p>
                           <p>Here the <hi>Bassa</hi> ended, and the Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
their admirations of the strange adventures
of his Story, when a menssenger brought word,
that the guard of soldiers who had the charge of
the Captives, was arrived; whereupon the
Grand Duke gave command, that they should
immediately be brought before him; but in the
mean time those Captives who had been taken
in other Christian ships, and were now relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by <hi>Pedro de Venturo,</hi> came to give thanks
to the Duke: amongst these <hi>Iosina</hi> presented
her self so excellent in beauty, that her presence
no less amazed the whole Court, then her Story
had done: The Grand Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> rising
from his Throne, saluted her, the like did the
Dukes of <hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> the last of which
seemed to eye her with a strange kinde of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and withall so much troubled in his
thoughts, that he was observed by the whole
presence; but at length not able longer to smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
them, he descended again from his seat,
and taking her by the hand, Madam, said he, if
I may not seem rude, or uncivil, to be thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive

into your fortunes at first sight, I would
willingly beg the favor to know of what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
you are. You have Sir, (replied she) put a
riddle to me, which I am not able to resolve,
for I never yet could learn of my Father what
Country I was a Native of; but this I know, that
he was an <hi>Hebrew</hi> by Nation. An <hi>Hebrew,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the Duke of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> shall I yet be so
much farther bold as to desire his name, if your
slavery and other miseries have not made you
forget it? He was Sir, answered she, called
<hi>Signor Gioseppe,</hi> and had many years been a
Merchant in <hi>Italy,</hi> till his fortunes there some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
decaying, he resolved to remove from
thence into the <hi>Levant,</hi> but in our way we were
taken by some Pyrates of <hi>Tunis,</hi> where he after
three years died a slave; but I continued so till
fortune instructed that noble <hi>Bassa,</hi> and my self,
to conspire our liberty. It is most true (said the
Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> to himself with the tears stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his eyes) but fair Virgin, continued he,
I once lost a daughter, who must be now about
your years and feature, and if the Cherry your
dead mother affirmed you had upon your right
Brest, agree with the Mold upon your Chin, I
must of force claim you for her; give me then
leave to see that infallible testimony. She im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
showed it to him, to the wonder of
them all: And the Duke no longer able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
himself, embracing her with a fatherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
the tears trickling down his cheeks for
joy: Is it then possible, said he, (my dear <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lietta</hi>)
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49502:132"/>
that after fourteen years absence I should
again be blessed with the sight of thee! Oh my

Jew <hi>Gioseppe</hi> stole from me at four years of age,
depriving not onely me of a childe, but my
Dukedom of an Heir: Oh! most worthy <hi>Bassa,</hi>
by whose means I am again blessed with an Issue,
since thou hast before gained her love, receive
her now again at my hands, and with her after
my decease, my Name and Dukedom: in this
extasie did the good Duke run on for near half
an hour, to the admiration of the whole pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
                           <p>But to make this day wholy repleat with
wonders, the valiant <hi>Goodlake</hi> met with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
which pleased him no less then could the
gaining of a whole Dukedom; for being espyed
by one of the redeemed Captives, though not
altogether so fair, yet not much yielding to the
beauty of <hi>Iulietta;</hi> she suddenly accosted him,
and to his great amazement, straitly embracing
him, cried out, And are the gods yet so favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

I fully requited for all the miseries I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone,
for all the cruelties of my Uncle, for
all my dangers at Land, and captivity at Sea.
Captain <hi>Goodlake</hi> was so strangely transported
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49502:132"/>
with this sudden accident, that he knew not
well what to answer, he beheld the visage, the
carriage, the speech, and the accent of his beloved
<hi>Mariana,</hi> yet could not but believe her dead,
and that all that he heard, or saw, was a meer
fantasm: But she seeing him in that passion, my
dear <hi>Goodlake,</hi> said she, from whence proceeds
this strange perplexity in thy minde? have I
ventured all dangers imaginable, and endured
all miseries to finde thee out, and wilt thou not
now own me for thy <hi>Mariana?</hi> how many times
hast thou solemnly sworn that without me thou
couldst not live? how many times hast thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
that I was the very essence of thy soul?
Away false man, if nothing will convince thee,
yet let this Ring, the last pledge I received of
thy Love, be a testimony against thee, for thy
perjuries, which the gods will without doubt
severely vindicate. <hi>Goodlake</hi> was yet more asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
at the strangeness of the adventure, but
at length recollecting himself, if thou be'est,
(said he,) the shade of my dear <hi>Mariana,</hi> as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

in me that could call thee from the eternal Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

cruelty of my Uncle, who to preserve to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
my Estate, and to put thee into despair,

the amazed <hi>Spencer</hi> ran joyfully to salute her,

embracing her with all that affection which
could be expected from so constant and loving a

their love, and confirmed their constancy.</p>
                           <p>But whilst they were thus embracing each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
an antient gentleman who had stood all this

himself to the generous <hi>Spencer</hi>'s fair Spouse.
Madam (said he) both of the names, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency

you are the Lady, I have so long been in search
for to deliver this letter to from your noble
Father. Certainly (Sir) said she, you are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
mistaken, for neither was my father
noble, nor hath he this many years been amongst

you and the world I likewise esteemed your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
hath upon her Death-Bed declared that the

her own and onely Infant soon after dying, she
loath to be childless, sent word to my Lord, that
you were dead; so that you have ever since
meanly lived, as childe to your Foster-father,
which yet could not obscure those noble vertues
inherent to your birth, and which declare you
to be, as indeed you are, the worthy Lady <hi>Isabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
sole daughter and heiress to my thrice noble
Master the Earl of <hi>Sherborn.</hi> You tell me, said
she, strange Paradoxes, and therewith breaking

Lord, nor will I in the least doubt it.</p>
                           <p>This joy was added to the rest of those great
adventures which had before happened, which
so rejoyced the grand Duke, that he resolved to
portion his entertainment equal to the strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

that the marriages between the Illustrious <hi>Bassa,</hi>
