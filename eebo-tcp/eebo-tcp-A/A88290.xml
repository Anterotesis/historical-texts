            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Apparition of the three Suns in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
I will acquaint thee with as rare a
Progedy which happened in <hi>Cheſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When firſt our unnaturall Wars began,
and that it was apparent, Warre would be
betwixt King and Parliament, Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> Knight
and Barronet of a Noble Family in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
deſerving of the whole Kingdome for his fidelity to
the Parliament, and without whoſe countenance our affaires
in thoſe parts could not ſo happily have ſucceeded: this gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
old Knight perceiving, that many of his Tennants were
neceſſarily to engage their perſons, for better incouragement
of them, he ſeriouſly profeſſed unto them, that if any Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
or Tennants ſonne of his, ſervant or any other that was
any of the lives in any the Leaſes made by him or any of his
Family, ſhould caſually be ſlaine in this unnaturall warre in
defence of the Parliament, Religion and Subjects Liberties,
that then he would make a new Leaſe <hi>Gratis,</hi> and inſert any
younger life in Liew thereof, which thing he hath conſtantly
and freely performed ever ſince to his eternall fame and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and if this be not worthy of eſpeciall taking notice of, I
know nothing; Nor let us forget the ſingular valour of his
<pb facs="tcp:113034:4"/>
Noble Grandchilde Collonell <hi>Booth</hi> during the ſiege of
<hi>Nantwich</hi> againſt the Engliſh Iriſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to our owne Diſcourſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there be any of ſo preuaricate a judgement, as to thinke
that the apparition of theſe three Suns doth intimate no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
thing to happen in our owne Climate, where they were
manifeſtly viſible, I ſhall lament their indiſpoſition and
conceiue their braines to be ſhallow, and voyde of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
humanity, or notice of common Hiſtory: For full
ſatisfaction of ſuch unbeleeuing Saints, I haue produced pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents,
not one or two, but many, and thoſe recorded by men
of unqueſtionable Credit. When was it knowne, that ſuch
like unuſuall ſights appeared, and were not the fore-runners
of things to come, yet ſeldome regarded before the things they
ſignifyed came to paſſe.</p>
            <p>I am of this opinion, the Heauens neuer ſend forth any
great ſignes, which haue not a particular relation to ſome
great perſonages: for doubtleſſe they are the Vniuerſall cauſe
(God permitting) of all things; and whileſt they produce ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
which ſeeme to haue relation to one onely: if he be a
Prince, it hath an Vniuerſall operation, for people are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
with their Princes, in their gaines, loſſes, vertues and
vices, and this is the reaſon why many times our predictions
doe not jumpe in that meaſure of time by us limited; for acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are not done by their Agents in an inſtant, diſpoſitions
precede them, &amp;c. Beſides, great alterations require great
influences, which when they cauſe great diuerſity in their
<pb facs="tcp:113034:4"/>
working, happen nor becauſe the influences are diuers, but
becauſe they are diuerſe that receiue them.</p>
            <p>Read me with indifferency, and poyſe me with an equall
judgement, I write with no prepared gall, no not againſt
Maſter <hi>Noworth</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who borrowes the groſſe of
his judgement in his laſt Almanack from my Prophetick
<hi>Merlin,</hi> nor am I angrie, but pitty that woodden Doctour
whether Atheiſt or Papiſt I know not, that ſwells with his
owne ignorant fancy, and ſayth, he can make it appeare,
what I ſpeake in behalfe of the Parliament, in point of Art
ought to happen to their enemies; this is one of thoſe purblind
Prophets, that in corners villifie the Parliaments Freinds,
and yet they uncontrolled harbour amidſt us, &amp;c. but this
thing called a Galeniſt I let paſſe, untill his capacity can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
a figure, &amp;c. Many and great are the judgements ready
to fall downe upon ſome great Families of England and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
but unleſſe an Angell, nay if an Angell from Heaven
ſhould report it, nothing will be beleeved: an <hi>Achan</hi> and
an <hi>Achitophell,</hi> or faction equivalent, both covetous and
irreligious, and countenancing for byereſpects, unworthy
men have wearied my Pen, diſheartned the Gentry to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable
loſſe, and impoveriſhment of the poore Commonallty,
and deſtruction of thoſe townes ſo unluckely committed to
their charge: Let the towne of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> be hereof an unlucky
preſident, which hath beene theſe three yeares fortifying, and
now on the ſuddain tranſmitted to his Majeſties forces. What
became of the vaſt ſummes of money there rayſed? why the
valiant Gentlemen diſplaced? and men of inferiour ranke
<pb facs="tcp:113034:5"/>
exalted? who gives any reaſon? unleſſe it was purpoſely done
to betray the Towne to our enemies, or by loſſe of that to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
the warres another yeare. You ſhall ſee if his Majeſties
Providence fortifie not that towne in leſſe monthes then we
in years; It muſt be diſcovered who, or whom have played the
plaine knaves with us, or elſe we ſhall never be at quiet.
Many complaine the taxes of that County have exceeded the
Incombes of Rent. Thus Diviſion, willfull Faction, a ſcabbie
Sect of covetous Sectaries undoe us, and diſparage our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
proceedings; but let it be remembred, his Majeſties
Preſſures firſt begot courage in us to reſiſt him: I hope thoſe
Divells that undo us will ſhortly be found out, till then, if we
thrive its miraculous. God grant our Parliament in time may
purge the Counties of all Schiſmaticall, who alone doe them
more miſchiefe then his Majeſties Army: Diſcontented that
the Gentry are no more reſpected, I will ingage no further at
this time.</p>
            <p>Its true, we gained <hi>Shrewesbury,</hi> and when the eyes of

of the effects attending thoſe Apparitions. Nor am I clearly of
that opinion many very judicious men, both of forepaſt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
times, are, That ſuch like Prodigies, Comets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do never
ſhew themſelves, but as precurſors of miſchief. What greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
did ever happen to mankinde, then the birth of our Saviour
Jeſus Chriſt? and yet was his coming manifeſted to us by a Star
or Comet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the like whereof we have never read or heard of.
And beſides, we have ſeen in our Age, that if that Comet in 1618
did deſigne out ill to the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family, as indeed it did; yet the
<hi>Swedes</hi> did thereupon thrive; and, before them, <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi>
Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> attained to great eſteem in the world, and
enlarged his Patrimony. I do willingly conſent to thoſe words
of that learned Phyſitian of our times, D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Brown,</hi> in the ſmall,
but unparallel'd Piece of his, <hi>Relig. Med.</hi> fol. 70. That <hi>thoſe noble
eſſences in heaven, bear a friendly regard to their fellow-natures on
earth;</hi> and that <hi>ſuch like Prodigies as theſe, are the charitable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
of good Angels, which more careleſſe Enquiries term but
the effects of Chance and Nature.</hi>

There be many now living, can hardly believe there was any
ſuch thing as three Suns appeared: and why? Becauſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
had not the ſight of them. Others will conſent ſuch like
things might be ſeen; but what ſhould be thereby ſignified, they
conceive is beyond Humane Capacity.</p>
            <p>To the firſt ſort of men, I ſay, That, as Chriſtians, we ought
to believe the report of one another, eſpecially in a matter
wherein there's no danger or prejudice can come either by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting
or not crediting the report, or wherein neither Religion
or our neighbour ſuffer ſcandall or harm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I ſay, Many
hundreds, of uncontradictible credit, did behold this: We have
it alſo mentioned in many mens printed Pamphlets; amongſt
the reſt, I hear the witty <hi>Aulicus</hi> hath gloſſed thereon. Sure I
am, <hi>Britannicus</hi> promiſed ſome Conceptions, which yet are not
come to publike view, upon that very ſubject.</p>
            <p>I here repreſent the form of it, as it appeared in the Element,
and was carefully taken and obſerved by one Maſter <hi>Heylet,</hi> who
courteouſly communicated it unto me.

I will endeavour to give a generall ſatisfaction, and firſt will
produce the yeers wherein formerly, long before our time, ſuch
Prodigies have been ſeen and recorded, and alſo what materiall
Occurrences did immediately, or within one or two yeers, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed:
Which being performed, I ſhall, God willing, fall upon
what effects I conceive ſhall be inſtantly ſubſequent to theſe three
Suns, the now-ſubject of my Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>IT is recorded, that in the One and fiftieth yeer after Chriſt,
there appeared three Suns at once, and forthwith they joyned
in one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In that yeer, <hi>Clodomire</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
what his predeceſſors had loſt. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<hi>Luke</hi> writes the Goſpel. <hi>Caractacus</hi> the valiant was led
in triumph to <hi>Rome,</hi> where a great Famine was the ſame yeer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 66. A Comet was ſeen, and alſo three Suns: In which
yeer, <hi>Florus</hi> Preſident of the Jews was by them ſlain. <hi>Paul</hi>
writes to <hi>Timothy.</hi> The Chriſtians are warned by a divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and depart out of <hi>Jeruſalem. Boadice</hi> a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Queen, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
Seventy thouſand <hi>Romanes.</hi> The <hi>Nazareni,</hi> a ſcurvie Sect,
begun, that boaſted much of Revelations and Viſions. About
a yeer after, <hi>Nero</hi> was proclaimed enemy to the State of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 69. In the Eaſt and in the Weſt two ſons were ſeen,
of the which one ſeemed weak and pale, the other ſtrong and
clear. In this yeer <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was taken by <hi>Titus,</hi> and Eleven
hundred thouſand <hi>Jews</hi> ſlain and made away in the Siege. <hi>Linus</hi>
was this yeer firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> where we may carefully
note, a Prodigie was the forerunner of <hi>Epiſcopacie</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi>
This yeer <hi>Galba</hi> is ſlain by <hi>Otho,</hi> having reigned but three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths.
And men ſuppoſe, that in this yeer the Goſpel of Saint
<hi>John</hi> was written at <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence I paſſe untill ſome later Genturies of yeers: for
from the yeer 69, to 1103, I finde none recorded in thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
I have read.</p>
            <p>In the yeer 1103, a Comet appeared in <hi>Normandy;</hi> and not
long after, two full Moons, one in the Eaſt, the other in the
Weſt. The Effects that followed inſtantly, were theſe: The ſon
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperour rebelleth againſt his father: A Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
was held in <hi>London</hi> for reformation of the Clergie. (I think
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113034:7"/>
that Tribe is out of order in all Ages.) All married Prieſts were
excommunicated by <hi>Anſelme:</hi> (this was a ſtrict Prieſt, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.)
<hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> forceth a Reſtitution of Church-goods ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiouſly
taken. This yeer began the long and cruell War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

of the Emperour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1156, the firſt of <hi>October,</hi> for three hours, there was

there was ſeen two Suns. The Pope, being an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man, is
taken Priſoner. The Kingdom of <hi>Denmark</hi> is divided: And in
the next yeer, the Pope and Emperour fall at variance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1157, in <hi>September,</hi> there were ſeen three Suns together,
in as clear weather as could be: And a few days after, in the ſame
moneth, three Moons, and, in the Moon that ſtood in the middle,
a white Croſſe. <hi>Sueno</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> at a great Feaſt, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<hi>Canutus: Sueno</hi> is himſelf ſlain, in purſuit of <hi>Waldemar.</hi>
The Order of <hi>Eremites,</hi> according to the rule of Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi>
begun this yeer; and in the next, the Pope ſubmits to the
Emperour: (was not this miraculous?) <hi>Lumbardy</hi> was alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
to the Emperour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1168, the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> there was ſeen at once in
the Weſt, three Suns: Two hours after, when two were gone,
he in the middle went down alone. By mediation of the <hi>French</hi>
King, <hi>Becket</hi> is reſtored to his Archbiſhoprick. <hi>Almaricus</hi> King
of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> calleth in the <hi>Turks</hi> to his aid, which was the

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1314, three Moons appeared. <hi>Lewis</hi> was Crowned

               <hi>Anno</hi> 1622, three Suns appeared at <hi>Heidelberg.</hi> The wofull
Calamities that have ever ſince fallen upon the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> we
are all ſenſible of, and of the loſſe of it, for any thing I ſee, for
ever, from the right Heir. <hi>Oſman</hi> the great <hi>Turk</hi> is ſtrangled
that yeer: and <hi>Spinola</hi> beſiegeth <hi>Bergen up Zoom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I have heard it credibly reported, that there were ſeen, about
twelve yeers ſince, many Suns at one time in <hi>Cornwall:</hi> and in
<hi>March</hi> 1639, towards Sun-ſet, three Suns were ſeen in the Weſt,
not far from <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have not ſeen any of theſe Suns I mention, my ſelf; onely
in thoſe ſix yeers in which I lived in the Countrey, <hi>viz.</hi> 1636,
1637, 1638, 1639, 1640, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> many evenings I obſerved
a ſtrange fiery skie, and unuſuall forms in the Elements, towards
that part of the heaven where <hi>Oxford</hi> ſtands, and towards <hi>Bark</hi>-ſhire,
<hi>Hamp</hi>-ſhire, and ſo alſo towards <hi>Buckingham</hi>-ſhire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have the rather repeated theſe things, that the incredulous
of the times might not be wavering, or a party now upon earth
too confident that theſe prodigious Sights have no ſignification
upon Mundane affairs. The Hiſtoricall part is now ended, and
my own Judgement upon thoſe three Suns apparent the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>November,</hi> 1644, followeth: Wherein, if oft repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
of the ſame thing trouble thee, with modeſty or courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
paſſe them by; for in Aſtrologie it cannot be avoided: Nor
do thou expect an exact Method from me, ſith it was no part of
my meaning, or could I conveniently do it: Onely this I muſt
tell thee, that the Interpretation I write, is, I conceive, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon probable foundations; and who lives to ſee a few yeers
over his head, will eaſily perceive I have unfolded as much as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113034:10"/>
was fit to diſcover, and that my Judgement is not a mile and a

            <p>MAny Philoſophers are of opinion, that theſe falſe Suns, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the learned called <hi>Parelii,</hi> do eſpecially appear,
when many ſubtill moiſt clouds are betwixt us and the Sun.
Others, that they are round clouds ſhining like the Sun; or that
they are images of the Sun in a thick and neighbouring cloud in
the form of a Mirror. But if that collected clouds, or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of vapours, or any Naturall cauſe, produced ſuch rare and
unuſuall Apparitions; Why have we not ſuch Sights oft? Its
well known, ſuch are not uſually ſeen, although once in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
we do not want plenty of Vapours, which, if they were
ſo produced, might cauſe monethly, or oftner, ſuch like Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
And beſides, when theſe three Suns were ſeen, it was a
very fair Sunſhine-day, a very clear day, no Clouds, Vapours,
Foggs or Miſts appearing. Indeed for ſeven or eight days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we at <hi>London</hi> had extreme ſtormy Weather, cloudy, windy,
rainy, and what not? I did not obſerve, for a long time, ſuch
variety of bluſtring and unnaturall Weather, which I conceive
was occaſioned by the late Oppoſition of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and
the matutine ſetting of the <hi>Virgiliae,</hi> and other moſt violent fixed

            </p>
            <p>Here's Naturall cauſes for the ill Weather preceding, ſo many
days together; but no cauſe in Natvre to induce a belief that the
three Suns were occaſioned from Nature.</p>
            <p>I am clearly of opinion, Theſe Sights, as well as many others,
were cauſed by thoſe tutelary Angels, who, by Gods permiſſion,
and under him, have the Government of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Common-wealth.
They are ſenſible of thoſe many impending Miſeries
now too plentifully amongſt us. Their conference with man
now, as in the days of old, very few attain unto, it being a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſought after by many, attained unto by few: And yet there
are ſome of opinion, There lives in the world ſome, and of
thoſe ſome, a ſmall Party in <hi>England,</hi> that know more then they
utter, and, either by Viſion, or verball Colloquie, have the
knowledge of future events, yea, even from the bleſſed Angels.</p>
            <p>But alas, theſe are Riddles; I muſt adhere unto my Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie;
and yet wiſh all happineſſe to thoſe good ſouls that either
confer with their own <hi>Genius,</hi> whom ſome call, A good Angel;
or with ſuch other of thoſe heavenly Miniſters whom God in
mercy affordeth them. And herein let no Reader miſtake me;
for I abhor Witches, or thoſe <hi>Necromancers</hi> that raiſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed
out of their graves, or thoſe Circular Prieſts now almoſt
worn out of the world: My meaning is this, That I do believe
there are many now living, to whom God, by his Angels, gives
Revelation of things to come: And where and to whom God
gives ſuch a bleſſing, I believe that Saint may lawfully uſe the
Talent God hath enabled him with.</p>
            <p>But I leave this obſolete, though excellent Learning, to another
Diſcourſe, and come to the Text it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I do ſomewhat adhere to</hi> Cardan, Seg. 4. Apho. 94. Signa cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca

thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The better to direct me in my Judgement, I have erected three
Scheams of heaven, and, according to my mean Capacity, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereupon of the effects of theſe three Suns.</p>
            <p>Neither indeed is <hi>Cardanus</hi> ſingle in his Judgement; for <hi>Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicus

Monſtrous bodies, and ſeldome ſeen, when beyond nature they
chance to ſhew themſelves; the hour of their firſt being is to be
conſidered: there's no ſuch things happen; but the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are deſigned from the ſuperceleſtiall bodies.</p>
            <p>And though this may ſeem ſtrange to moſt men that ſhall read
this Diſcourſe; yet I hope the Judgement following ſhall, in
ſome meaſure, better ſatisfie them, if they will have patience
firſt to read it warily, and then to obſerve the generall Affairs of
<hi>England,</hi> and all or the moſt part of Chriſtendom, preſently, or
within a little compaſſe of time ſubſequent. Nor let any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriſt

By which this learned <hi>Grecian</hi> intends, that the true notion of
what may be ſignified by theſe late diſaſtrous three Suns, or any
other unnaturall Apparition, is moſt eaſily attained, by taking
the exact time of their firſt appearance, and then the erection of
a Scheam of heaven.</p>
            <p>And this I finde further confirmed by <hi>Cardanus, Apho.</hi> 95.

in betwixt two Conjunctions of the Fiery Triplicity, the firſt
entrance whereof was in 1603, and their Conjunction in the
eighth degree of <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> the very ſelf-ſame ſigne, degree, and
quarter of heaven the Sun and Moon are in upon this preſent
Apparition.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> came to be our Engliſh King that yeer.</p>
            <p>In the full-Moon poſtventionall to the Comet, 1618, the Sun

ſenſe, That when ſuch a Prodigie as he ſpeaks of appears, it ſhews,
or is the antecedent of ſome new Principality, or ſome notable
Priviledges to be obtained, or the birth or riſe of ſome man or
Common-wealth to Sovereignty, and to that ſupreme Command
which was not before. Believe me, O all you great ones, there's
ſome ſuch Monſter in hatching, as the depriving of many of you
of that Freedom your Anceſtours left you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

If we take ſignification from the predominant Planet, we
ſhall acquaint you in plain Engliſh, That Religion ſhall be a
ſtrong Pretender, and a painfull Stickler in moſt Common-wealths,
for ſome yeers. <hi>Venus,</hi> as now poſited, tells you how
much ſome ſober and modeſt Judgements endeavour to ſettle
things purely, ſoberly, and legally: But if you look into the
third houſe, you ſhall finde <hi>Saturn</hi> Retrograde, and in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to her. Maſter <hi>Booker</hi> ſaith, <hi>Saturn</hi> ſignifies <hi>Tom Jew</hi> and
<hi>Jack Jeſuite: Bona fide,</hi> I ſay, That we are hereby premoniſhed
of men in our Common-wealth that are as ſuperſtitious as the
<hi>Jew,</hi> and malicious as the <hi>Jeſuite;</hi> and that theſe hodge-podge
mixture of ſhallow-brains ſhall diſturb all our proceedings.
Good God! that ſo much deceit and hypocriſie ſhould be veiled,
and we continue ignorant of the Plot thereby intended.</p>
            <p>What incongruous and inconſiſtent Opinions, even to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
it ſelf, do I foreſee by this froward and malicious Aſpect of
<hi>Saturn,</hi> ſhall appear in the world, vex all or moſt Nations, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
almoſt every State and Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Methinks here's to be plenty of Ambaſſadours ſeverally em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed:
What Concluſion they ſhall make, the Retrogradation
of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the fifth tells you, Worſe and worſe, Tinker-like,
mend one hole, and make two; or, if you will, Salve up a little
Breach, and not long after make one five times greater.</p>
            <p>Mutuall Aſſiſtance ſhall be pretended, and one Nation or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
leagues with another; but to what purpoſe? That
Policie which in the conception of the wiſeſt Statiſt is held moſt
convenient for his Prince and Countrey, even in that very point
ſhall his King or State ſuffer moſt detriment. Can we delude
God? or have the Stars no Influence? or can we by Art or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
make the two unneceſſary invironing Suns, which are no
better then Scar-crows or outward appearances, to be reall,
proper and materiall ones? I muſt deal plainly, that we in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
(for <hi>Saturn</hi> is in <hi>Aries,</hi> the Aſcendant of <hi>England</hi>) under
pretence of a glorious ſhew for Reformation in divine matters,
intend deceitfully; and that miſchievous Intentions, under reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Pretenſions, are moſt viperouſly cloked.</p>
            <p>But upon maturer Conſideration, while I ſee the hand of the
Almighty deading and dulling our underſtandings, I apprehend
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113034:13"/>
the Stars as directory-Meſſengers of ſome ſuch things, but in my
ſolid Judgement conclude it the All-ſeeing providence of God.
God is angry we will ſee nothing; but more angry, becauſe,
though ſome do ſee and perceive, and know to what Ruine we
are haſtening; yet, like mute Statu's, they are ſilent in this great
neceſſity of the State, and cloſe up their mouthes, leſt they ſhould
utter Verity.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Genius,</hi> if it be lawfull to ſay ſo, dictates unto me nothing
but Fraud, Cozenage, Diſſimulation, Hypocriſie, will be uſed
amongſt ſome pretended-Reformers both of Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
            <p>If I underſtand any thing, ſcandalous aſperſions ſhall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
number or juſt cauſe, be fathered upon our Parliament and
their Proceedings: hainous and formidable Informations againſt
the Nobility and Gentry. Seurrilous Reproaches from all parts
ſhall fall upon our Senior and Orthodox Clergie-men, from a
Junior ſort of Rabbies, a Serpentine people not heretofore viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or known in the world, lately elapſed by chance, not from
heaven, (where Goodneſſe it ſelf dwells) but from the Moon,
(which <hi>Galileus</hi> ſaith is habitable) in ſome terrible Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clap:
for I believe they were ſo terrified and ſtupified in their
hearings, by their ſo violent deſcent in that ſtorm, that not any
ſenſe could ever ſince pop into their Noddles.</p>
            <p>Reaſon in Aſtrologie muſt be given, and ſo it ſhall. <hi>Mercury</hi>
generally ſignifieth in Man, Youth: his Orientality of the Sun,
and in the Figure, addes more Youth: But now in the ſenſe I
ſpeak it, it tells the whole World, the Novelty of what now
moſt afflicts us. <hi>Jupiter</hi> is generally a Significator of Nobility,
and by poſition of the Clergie, he is under the earth, and in the
deſcending part of heaven: we hear of things now, that did
not appear before, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From whence I frame this Judgement,
That Youth, or young novell Opinions or Diſputations, ſhall
deceitfully prejudice maturer Judgements, with Lyes, Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
Calumny, Impudence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I ſay again, Becauſe <hi>Mars</hi>
that is Lord of the tenth Houſe, diſpoſeth of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and he
is Retrograde in the ſeventh Houſe, and manſion of the Moon,
and oppoſite to the Aſcendant; I deliver ingeniouſly this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
Judgement, That if his Majeſtie give protection to ſuch
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113034:14"/>
upſtart pretended-Saints, he ſhall run Retrograde, that is, he
ſhall receive infinite Diſhonour by it. And to our Parliament I
ſay, If Connivance be had, under their Protection, with theſe
ſuperlative aſſuming Zelotes, (for my heart will not ſuffer me
to abuſe Religion ſo much, as to call them Religious) the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
ſhall more ſuffer in the concluſion, even by them, then
either by the <hi>Turk,</hi> were he armed againſt us, or all the Forces
of any potent Enemy. I cannot call them by any certain name,
that ſo they might be diſtinguiſhed: do but obſerve their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and it beſt informs you: they abſolutely ſtudie nothing but
Diviſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſuppreſſion of Monarchy.</p>
            <p>The very true meaning of theſe three Suns, is to inform every
Common-wealth of <hi>Europe,</hi> that they are haſtening to either
their Confuſions, or unavoidable Dangers: The Counſels of the
moſt aged ſhall be deſpicable, the Projections of the younger
men ſhall cauſe Inſurrections, Slaughters, Murders; the Advice
of the moſt wiſe ſhall be innocently ſlighted. A great Work is
in hand.</p>
            <p>Both Sun and Moon are ill placed. Both Kings and People,
and all Common-wealths, are in their Councels now to ſeek.
They have cunningly, as long as they could, carried their Devices
ſecretly: This Prodigie ſpeaks, as if we ſhall diſcover more
then is wiſhed, and yet conceal enough to undo us.</p>
            <p>Three Suns have been ſeen many times, and ſeverall Circles,
ſometimes over, ſometimes under the true and proper Sun: <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiones

                  </expan> alienationem:</hi> Junct. 312. Here's a ſtrange thing,
that they do manifeſt publike and eminent Seditions amongſt
mortall men, and a generall alienation or averſneſſe to any Peace,
Agreement, or Unity. Infinite Diviſions theſe three Suns are
the Forerunners of; of ſturdie Diſturbances to Emperours,
Kings, Princes, and all manner of Principalities: and they do
uſually ſhew a generall Calamity at hand; they declare Schiſms
and Rents in the Church, Diſorder amongſt the Religious, the
brooding or upſtarting of ſome cragged or rugged Tenents in
Divinity, ſome admirable, miraculous, and unexpected paſſages
amongſt men, a generall <hi>Delirium</hi> or madneſſe, or Confuſion in
Opinions reigning and raging, and to domineer in moſt parts of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113034:14"/>
thoſe Countreys adjacent to the place of appearance. All man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of inferiour people threatning their Superiours and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
grumbling, repining, whiſpering out revenge againſt
them: No union in Counſel, or conſtancy in Opinion: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is thought on, but how to bring the whole Fabrick of
every Common-wealth out of frame: Not a man appears, but
he is more judicious in State-affairs then <hi>Ahithophel:</hi> Each Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
in Divinity aſſures himſelf of more knowledge then <hi>Calvin,
Luther</hi> or <hi>Melancton</hi> were acquainted with, poor Ideots: The
acts of the moſt Reverend men preceding ſuch times, are called
in queſtion, the validity of their Judgement undervalued, and a
Rabble of <hi>Saturnine</hi> people fill the Times with Ignorance, the
Church with Sects, the Common-wealth with Beggery, and
their own Coffers, <hi>tantum quantum,</hi> with as much Money as
they can theeviſhly cozen the King, Kingdom and State of.</p>
            <p>Is there need of more Suns then one in the day? or of more
then one Moon in the night? or of one King in a Kingdom?
one entire Government in a Common-wealth? one uniformity
in the Affairs of the Church? Verily I think that man out of his
wits, that would affirm a poſitive neceſſity of more: and yet
uſually, after the appearing of ſuch Prodigies, ſuch lawleſſe and
and unaccuſtomed Monſters appear: and even ſuch moſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Attempts are to be proſecuted by people of as great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
as the two mock-Suns, which appeared at an inſtant, but
vaniſhed not away in a moment.</p>
            <p>When God Almighty had drowned the world, in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he would do ſo no more, he produced the Rainbowe, and
made it appear at all times and ſeaſons in a conſtant and naturall
form and manner, ever oppoſite to the Sun; and this was out of
his great love to Mankinde: But while in anger he permits his
miniſtring Angels (as now he did) to manifeſt to our eyes a
Rainbowe (and that ſuch a one as no Age hath abſolutely recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the like) to appear with the Bend of it downward, juſt
over the naturall Sun. The Prognoſtick part hereof may gravell
an aſſured Judgement. Reader, pity the weakneſſe of Humane
underſtanding, and let thy love appear, in charitably paſſing by
my failings.</p>
            <p>The Portent of this Prodigie is very great: The Angels are
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113034:15"/>
willing we ſhould diſcern ſomething, elſe why was it made vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible?
There was no neceſſity of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O</hi> All you Emperors, Kings, Princes, Rulers and Magiſtrates
of <hi>Europe,</hi> this unaccuſtomed Apparition is like the Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing
in <hi>Daniel</hi> to ſome of you; it premoniſheth you, above all
other People, to make your peace with God in time: You ſhall every
one of you ſmart, and every one of you taſte (none excepted) the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
hand of God, who will ſtrengthen your Subjects with invincible
Courage to ſuppreſſe your Miſgovernments and Oppreſſions in
Church or Common-wealth: Nor ſhall War ceaſe, or the Sword of
God leave perſecuting you and your Off-ſprings, untill this great
Work is perfectly done. What will you ſay, if the Almighty is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to let fall from heauen a new Government, quite contrary to any
hath hitherto been in the world? Here's threatned an univerſall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
againſt you by your oppreſſed People. Here's either the
Depoſing, Flight, or finall Extirpation of ſome of you, at hand:
Your Viceroys, Lieutenant-Generalls, ſhall quake and tremble, and
prove men of no Courage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall ſhrink from you in your greatest
neceſſity: Your Confederates ſhall fail in reall Performances, and do
you more miſchief then a profeſſed enemy: Your Children ſhall wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
as baniſhed People all over the world, die unlamented in ſtrange
Countreys, while ſome of your own Generation, of ſet purpoſe, ſhall
bring you in diſlike of your vaſſails.</p>
            <p>Thoſe words are generall: A word to my own Countrey of
<hi>England.</hi> Verily I am doubtfull there's now as great Treaſon in
hatching againſt <hi>England,</hi> as either the <hi>Armado</hi> in 1588, or furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Gunpowder-Plot in 1605. I am ſcrupulous, for the love I
bear to my native Soil, whileſt I conceive there's a ſecond Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre
in agitation; and yet I faithfully believe we ſhall really o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
it, and maturely, and in good ſadneſſe, take luſty Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
on the Contrivers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are not both the Lights, in our Scheam, with or neer <hi>Cor
Scorpii,</hi> a moſt violent fixed Star? which uſually (if we believe
Antiquity or Experience) threatens ſudden and violent death;
elſe why have we this Aphoriſm? <hi>Cor Scorpii cum Luminaribus
cruentam mortem, aut ex veneno repentinam denuntiat.</hi> He or ſhe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113034:15"/>
of any great Family, that hath either the Sun or Moon, or both,
with this Star, in the Radix of their Nativities, are threatned
hereby, either to die ſome violent death by caſualty, Sword, Gun,
or Poiſon. Look to your ſelves; here's ſome monſtrous death
towards you. But to whom? wilt thou ſay. Herein we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the Signe, Lord thereof, and the Houſe: The Sun ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
in that Royall Signe, great ones; the Houſe ſignifies Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Poiſon, Treachery: From which is derived thus much, That
ſome very great man, what King, Prince, Duke, or the like, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
affirm I perfectly know not, ſhall, I ſay, come to ſome ſuch
untimely end.</p>
            <p>What Magiſtrate ſoever of <hi>Europe</hi> hath the Sun or Moon in
the place now afflicted, his perſon and eſtate will be in danger:
Where the 6, 7 or 8 of <hi>Sagittarius</hi> do culminate, he loſes his
Sovereignty: where the ſame degrees ariſe in the Horoſcope, it
threatens his life; witneſſe the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Great men may, and I know will, deſpiſe theſe favourable
Admonitions. Let them ſo do, and afterwards cry, <hi>Had I wiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here in our Figure we have all the ſuperiour Planets Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade,
as if all the Grandees of the world, and every principall
man in his kinde, ſhould finde vexation enough; or as if every
State and Common-wealth, or Society of men, were declining,
and ready to ſuffer in one kinde or other. <hi>Significat etiam mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bos

or principall Officer die.</p>
            <p>What ſucceſſe ſhall follow of Treaties, or from or by means
of Meſſengers, Commiſſioners, Ambaſſadours, Nuntio's, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
or Provinciall Councels, you may read by the poſiture of

matters, the length of time ſhall be ſpent in Embaſſages, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

finger of God) any good Concluſion, when the Significators ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by oppoſition? Long, deceitfull and painfull Debates, ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and impertinent Concluſions.</p>

Men are employed by ſome, to good intents and purpoſes;

Tenent of or from an unſetled Separatiſt, hinders and makes
void all concluſion of difference by Negotiations and Treaties.
Whereas formerly Commiſſioners from Prince to Prince have
determined the greateſt Controverſies ever happened; there's
now in the Figure of heaven no apparance of ſuch bleſſings, the
Sword being onely intended to decide theſe conſuming Plagues
and inveterate Quarrels that either have or ſhall, for ſome yeers,

            <p>The Rainbowe ſeemed occularly to be amongſt the Northern
Conſtellations, above the Aequator, in that ſpace of heaven
where the learned place <hi>Serpentarius,</hi> or the form of a Serpent,
his mouth gaping wide open, and a Crown ready to fall into

            <p>This is the ſecond time, within one yeers ſpace, that ſome
Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> have been threatned with Ruine and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
(if they repent not) for the laſt of <hi>June,</hi> 1644, there
were ſtrange Apparitions in the heavens, in this very Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and now again this unuſuall Rainbowe extending it ſelf
over the proper Sun, and quite thorow the body of the Serpent.
Let me adde to this, The ſubſequent Eclipſe I ſhall write of,
hath no little ſignification in the fortune and perſons of Kings
and great men.</p>
            <p>Was not our mother <hi>Eve</hi> deceived by ill counſel given unto
her by the devil in form of a Serpent? and was not <hi>Adam</hi> thereby
himſelf miſtaken, and ſo his whole Poſterity made capable of
that puniſhment he for that ſuffered, and we all by his act?</p>
            <p>It was not <hi>Adam,</hi> it was not <hi>Eve,</hi> but the Serpent: Its not
Kings or Princes, its not their Queens or Ladies, that invent
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113034:16"/>
thoſe execrable Counſels ſo totally deſtructive; no, it's the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
it's, in plain language, ſuch deſtructive Counſel as is put

men of great Conformity outwardly, that deceitfully hatch
theſe helliſh Advices.</p>
            <p>I wiſh, in time, great men to become themſelves; for if ſome
good Angel hath hitherto ſeemed to keep their Crowns, their
Dominions, their Authority, from dropping into the Serpents

notwithſtanding, did no notable or ſpeciall Service anſwerable to ſo

               </p>
               <p>In the Life of <hi>Pelopidas</hi> you ſhall read, that upon his ſecond
Journey againſt the Tyrant <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Pheres,</hi> a great Eclipſe
of the Sun was, cauſing great darkneſſe at noon-day. You may
read, <hi>fol.</hi> 303 in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that <hi>Pelopidas</hi> wilfulneſſe, contrary to
the advice of ſome in the Army, coſt him his life: for not onely
thoſe that were then verſed in Soothſaying, but his own Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
told him, That this Eclipſe did threaten the death of ſome
great Perſon like himſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which his death exactly verified.</p>
               <p>You ſhall alſo read in the Life of <hi>Nicias,</hi> That inſtantly after

to flee, and that City, after 48 yeers, reſtored to liberty.
That was no weak Judgement therefore that <hi>Mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>as</hi> the Sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayer
reſolutely delivered, upon ſight thereof: <hi>My good friends,
be of good chear, and aſſure your ſelves that we ſhall proſper; for
God doth foreſhew us, by this Sight we ſee, that ſome one of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113034:19"/>
chiefeſt things now in higheſt place and dignity ſhall be eclipſed.</hi>

               <p>He that ſhall pleaſe but to peruſe <hi>Leovitius de Conjunctionibus
&amp; Eclipſibus,</hi> may be more fully ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>And yet if examples of late yeers work any thing in us, we
cannot forget that eminent Eclipſe in 1639, and in the moneth
of <hi>May:</hi> I am ſure we were never quiet ſince: It was fully
viſible in our Horizon. We may not forget the overthrow of
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet upon our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coaſts, within four moneths
after, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all my reading, I finde <hi>Solar</hi> Eclipſes are moſt ominous to
Princes, to Authority, Magiſtracy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that Eclipſes of the
Moon do both afflict King and People; but moſt properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
and excite the Subjects to Arms, and the vulgar againſt his
Lord and Maſter.</p>
               <p>For whereas the <hi>Solar</hi> Eclipſe puts difference betwixt one
Prince and another, betwixt one State &amp; another, one Noble-man
and another, each Common-wealth againſt his next neighbour;
a <hi>Lunar</hi> Eclipſe, on the contrary, ſtirs up people of more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

But the decay of Tillage and Husbandry is the leaſt thing

That if an Eclipſe happen in that Eclipticall degree in which at

its an argument (ſaith he) of ſome danger at hand hardly to be

               <p>We cannot forget that fearfull loſſe his Majeſtie of <hi>Spain</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

Truely I fear that ſame potent Prince muſt have another ſuch like
Bruſh; for the three Suns doth in a manner deliver ſo much:
and look carefully what Nation or Prince ſuffered upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of that Eclipſe, ſhall again by theſe three Suns apparition,
in a more then miraculous way, if it be poſſible, be loaded
with misfortune.</p>
               <p>Prodigies in heaven, of heaven, and from heaven, appear not
in vain: Eclipſes do ever foreſhew ſome notorious and eminent
matter neer hand, yea, in a moſt peaceable ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>The Courts of all Princes ſhall be ſtricken dead with fear,
horrour and amazement; Privie Counſellours ſhall be trampled
down like dirt under our feet.</p>
               <p>In the Eaſt, from the Eaſt, or ſomewhat South-eaſt, ſhall the
beginnings of ſome miraculous Accidents have ſome firſt life,
motion and beginning. But this is quite out of the Text.</p>
               <p>If, as the wiſeſt men conceive, the Sun and Moon do govern
our body and ſpirit, and ſo moderate the Elements, that all men,
even every vulgar perſon underſtands it; what ſhall we then
think to be more admired or formidable, then when we, upon
a ſudden, ſee theſe moſt glorious Bodies obſcured, and their light
taken from our preſent ſight? We may from thence imagine,

But whether this Eclipſe ſhall point out his death within the

               <p>I finde, upon the laſt Reſtauration of <hi>Rome,</hi> 1506, that both
<hi>Mars, Saturn,</hi> and the <hi>Dragons tail,</hi> were in <hi>Leone,</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

I admoniſh the Prelaticall Tribe of Cardinals to provide
good ſtore of Money, and the Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> to be no niggards
of their purſes: A Famine is threatned to them, and ſome parts

of many ſtately houſes: Neither do I poſitively affirm, that a
ſtrong Intruder ſhall waſte part of <hi>Italy,</hi> or ſupplant ſome very
good Families therein. I ſee plenty of Conſults amongſt the
Princes, fruitleſſe Embaſſages, variance upon Niceties, even to
wearineſſe, a giddineſſe amongſt wiſe people. Worthy men,
you have moſt admirable men amongſt you, that yet keep a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall

mercileſſe fires, and extravagant commanding Souldiers: A
Plague will wander thorow that ſpacious City, to the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of ſome ſcores of thouſands.</p>
               <p>Nor is any great ſucceſſe to attend the Emperours of <hi>Greece,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Countrey-men, I tell you, <hi>Gemini</hi> is in the eighth Houſe of

of many poor Creditors abroad, and from thence a generall Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage

               <p>Indeed, courteous <hi>George Naworth,</hi> I would not reſide in

ſome Calamity to <hi>Oxford.</hi> Our Citie muſt ſtand yet, to day, and

meaning: he that would know the truth, <hi>viz.</hi> when, and how
long, he muſt firſt know the Aſtrologicall way of numbers, and
what doth mean 1732, then he may give a moderate ſenſe, and
yet come ſhort of the Authors meaning, and of truth it ſelf;
yet ſhall he come to a knowledge not deſpicable, nor repent
that he ſpent ſome time in the diſquiſition hereof.</p>

But why, or wherefore, will ſome buſie-body ſay? I anſwer
with <hi>Hermes, In Revolutione annorum mundi multae difficultates
erunt &amp; praelia, cum in exaltationibus fuerint</hi> Jupiter <hi>&amp;</hi> Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.
In the Revolution of one of the yeers of the world, you
ſhall judge many difficulties and Battels, when <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Jupiter</hi>
are in their Exaltations. If this hold true in a Figure of the
Suns entrance into <hi>Aries,</hi> much more in an eminent Eclipſe.
We have onely <hi>Jupiter</hi> of thoſe two Planets exalted in our
Scheam, he doth by his now-poſition ſignifie unto us things
concerning Religion, Laws, Leagues, Covenants, all manner of
Aſſociation, either of one Prince with another, or man with
man generally: as here poſited, now he prenotes high points to
be in handling, in things Divine. <hi>Jove</hi> is but entring his exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Shall a people begin, with great ardour and vigour, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
new Tenents in Religion, and not live to ſee them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed?</p>
               <p>Is there no ſtability in this world? One Sect to day, another
to morrow. Shall leſſe then a Sabbath of yeers blot almoſt out
of remembrance many fruitleſſe Niceties in Doctrine? Why
the Clergie of <hi>Europe,</hi> in a time ſo troubleſome, ſhould invent
ſo many new Opinions, to be permanent ſo little a while, I
know not.</p>
               <p>What ſhall we do? or whither do we arrive with theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Diſputes? I ſee <hi>Jupiter</hi> direct at the time of the Eclipſe,
but Retrograde two moneths after. We have a Proverb in
<hi>Engliſh</hi> doth well expreſſe that ſenſe, <hi>viz. He was turned out of
his place, before he was warm in his Gears:</hi> The aſſured ſenſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is this, That when the world thinks Religion ſetled, its then
furtheſt off from a ſollid confirmation. One Generation comes,
and another paſſeth away; the later uſually corrects and refines
the former: So will it be, even till man, as well as Religion, in
this world have no more being.</p>
               <p>In perſon I am not more remote from <hi>

               <p>Nor let that vain and enforced Opinion, without ſenſe, hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
or art, in that purblinde-Prognoſtication (printed at <hi>Oxford</hi>

well-affected to the Parliament, upon this direfull forenamed

of <hi>September,</hi> are theſe: <hi>At Michaelmas there's an hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Oppoſition of</hi> Saturn <hi>and</hi> Mars: <hi>ſomething of great conſequence

               </p>
               <p>But why this Oppoſition ſhould prejudice the Parliament, I
ſee not: It promiſeth them ſuch a Victory over their enemies, as
they yet never had. And I will refer the reaſon of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to any moderate Artiſt. In this Eclipſe, <hi>Mars</hi> is Lord of
the Aſcendant, and ſo hath ſignification of our Parliaments af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
<hi>Saturn</hi> therein is their enemy, becauſe placed in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
houſe: Now when <hi>Mars</hi> in his own houſe comes to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of <hi>Saturn,</hi> having no Fortitudes, if we knock not our
our enemies ſoundly, I ſay then God is angry with us. It points

But let this man of errour conſider the Figure of the Suns en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance

his grief, the <hi>Dragons tail</hi> in the tenth houſe, and <hi>Saturn</hi> Lord of

of that poſition, and ſee if ſuch a glorious Conqueſt be thereby

            <head>POSTSCRIPT. Since the Impreſsion of the Starry Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger,
and before its Publiſhing, I received an
Oxford Pamphlet, to which I returne this Anſwer, and
ſo ſend them both into the world together.</head>
            <head type="sub">An Examination of an Astrologicall Judgement upon
His Majeſties preſent Martch, begun from Oxford, 7. May.
1645. Set forth purpoſely by G. WHARTON to advance
their declining condition, to impedite the Parliaments,
and diſhearten the City and Citizens of LONDON.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hile we divide, the enemy unites; our factions proove their
victories, <hi>Wharton</hi> in behalfe of our Enemies appears pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
nay requeſted by perſonages of Honour (<hi>per fas aut
nefas</hi>) whether he lie or not, ſo it advance, its no matter:
are any ſo indulgent on our ſide? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I muſt begin with his Epiſtle, wherein the Author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes
to deliver his Judgement in generall termes, and yet,
forgetfull, being not (<hi>Mendax memor</hi>) a lyer of a good
memory, he goes on in the whole diſcourſe, aſſigning and
determining the ſucceſſe of His Majeſties martch and his
Army in particular words and termes, as appears, Fol. 4. line 20. 21 Fol. 5. line 10. Fol. 6.
line 10. In all which places he proclaimes victory, upon victory to His Majeſtie, and
not ſo much as the loſſe of one lowſe on their own party.</p>
            <p>In the next place he ſoberly dehorts Maſter <hi>Booker</hi> and my ſelfe from adhearing to the
Parliament, and tells a tale of a tubb, as of <hi>Gauricus,</hi> a certaine Prieſt, &amp;c. That
medled with the particular deſtiny of Princes, and were therefore well rewarded, and
<pb facs="tcp:113034:30"/>
ſo would he have Maſter <hi>Booker</hi> and mee, for publiſhing pernicious Pamphlets, as this
man calls them.</p>
            <p>Were I commanded, I would make it apparant, the Parliaments cauſe ſhall not
want a Champion in Aſtrology to confute any thing in point of Art that can bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
from the greateſt Clerks in <hi>Oxford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is on our ſide; the Conſtellations of Heaven after a while will totally appeare
for the Parliament, and caſt terrour, horrour, amazement, and frights on all thoſe
Dammee-Blades now in Armes againſt us, &amp;c. But our Author in his Epiſtle goes on,
and makes it evident, he hath read part of the laſt leafe in <hi>Cardan:</hi> whoſe words he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites,
viz. Never tell 2 King of any danger neer unto him: then, its probable, we muſt
ſay as <hi>Ahabs</hi> Prophets: <hi>Go to Ramoth Gilead and proſper:</hi> yes; ſo he did; for there the
poor miſled King was ſlaine: I am Maſter <hi>Wharton</hi> ſo farre from your mind, that did I
know any ſuddain danger neer to His Majeſtie. <hi>I</hi> would adventure to the hazard of my
life through both Armies to give him warning, and ſo would maſter <hi>Booker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doe you Maſter <hi>Wharton</hi> read <hi>Cardan</hi> on the ſame ſide, and thereby rectifie your parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Judgement. <hi>In praedicendo, amoveas timorem, odium &amp; amorem:</hi> when you take upon
you to praedict to a Prince (as you now in particuler do) neither ſpeak or write out of
feare, hatred or love: and you might know what <hi>Ptolomey</hi> commands, viz: that in
every Judgement we beware of flattery and hatred, for that renders the Art fallible and
the Artiſt ſcandalous.</p>
            <p>You are guilty in the breach of theſe Aphoriſmes, while you call our Parliament Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
and convert every Judgement to ſignifie victory to his Majeſty: and leave the end of
His martch untoucht becauſe you love to ſpeak <hi>Placentia:</hi> for in truth the ſcheame it ſelf
promiſes an unluckie end to your ſo fortunate and ſo much applauded martch. Doe but
read <hi>Goclenius in diſcurſu pro Aſtrolo.</hi> Fol. 11<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Anglorum fere reges omnes;</hi> having peruſed thoſe words, deal plainly with the world,
and thoſe Honourable perſonages at Oxford, which imploy you.</p>
            <p>For his Majeſties Nativity, I thinke Maſter <hi>Booker</hi> and I have ſome other better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
we love not to take paines for ſo ſlight a reward as followes the handling
the <hi>Geneſis</hi> of a Prince without His conſent: but get me publike licenſe, under His

               <p>THe body of the diſcourſe intends two things principally; threatnings againſt the
City of <hi>London,</hi> victories to His Maieſtie, or confuſion to His Enemies, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Not to play the Critick with this Univerſity Freſhman, or Cavill at his ignorance in
collecting the debilities of <hi>Venus</hi> which he makes more then they are by placing her, in

Nor is <hi>Mercury</hi> debilitated by occidentallity: <hi>Orig.</hi> 540. Nor is <hi>Venus</hi> fortified by Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,

                  <hi>Lilly.</hi> Well may <hi>George</hi> have a great Whetſton, he well deſerves it; out of his owne

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:113034:30"/>
That <hi>Gemini</hi> is the aſcendant of the City of <hi>London</hi> all Authors agree, and <hi>George</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
in his firſt Progg.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Mercury</hi> is Lord of that ſigne, and ſimply moſt ſtrong in this preſent figure, its
his owne words at this time.</p>
               <p>Neither is the ſigne, or Lord thereof afflicted, but on the contrary the moſt Potent
Planet in the figure, yea more dignifyed then <hi>Sol</hi> or <hi>Venus,</hi> he is in Conjunction with
<hi>Jupiter,</hi> and in Trine with the <hi>Moone</hi> who tranſlats the Light and Virtue of <hi>Venus</hi> to <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury:</hi>
now according to <hi>George</hi> his owne words, Fol. 3. Theſe are undeniable teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
both of the ſafety and honour of this famous City and Citizens thereof, nor doth
it in the leaſt particle point out by this his Majeſtyes martch any danger, loſſe, miſery,
or accidents unto them; this Conſtellation foretells what fame and eſteeme the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
hereof ſhall attaine, by being the Kingdomes Bulwarke againſt Tyranny and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
by releeving the many thouſands plundred and pillaged by his Majeſtyes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
and that this city ſhall get into their power one time or other all their enemies,
perhaps in a very ſhort time, for we ſee <hi>Mercury</hi> diſpoſeth of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> I ſeriouſly avow
upon my reputation to the whole Kingdome, this Judgement I give, is, and will prove
true according to the Scheame of heaven <hi>Wharton</hi> hath ſet, &amp;c. Who proſecutes his
ſtory with many invectives alleadged without Art or Judgement, and laſt of all, invites
me to the Combate, with theſe words, <hi>The Moone is in the 6, very ſick (Maſter Lilly) and
neere the Dragons taylae, this will teach the Citizens their Allegiance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An Vtopian judgement Maſter <hi>Wharton,</hi> that the afflicted <hi>moone</hi> in the ſixt ſhould
teach us ſlavery: Our obedience we well know, we have performed our Allegiance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
neceſſity inforced us for the Defence of the Parliament and our owne greivances to
ſtand in Armes, and ingage our perſons for the Publique Good: but what is this to the
thing in queſtion. Maſter <hi>Wharton</hi> ſee to it, there hath beene one Eclips in <hi>Leo,</hi> there
will be another the eleventh of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> Remember <hi>George.</hi> The laſt Vomit againſt the
city is an imprecation, that unleſſe they ſubmit to their Princes mercy, he like one of
<hi>Baalls</hi> Preiſts falſely propheſieth ſuch things unto them as cannot be diverted. But in
what Apocripha he learned this Aſtrology, it appeares not to mee; no not out of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
Ingreſſes, which are ſignifycantly all averſe to his Majeſty and that party.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Wharton,</hi> having left the City with a curſe, begins with full Sayles to tell us:
<hi>All the good our hearts can wiſh for is promiſed by this Scheame;</hi> Stay falſe prophet, your hearts
wiſh every day for the City of <hi>London,</hi> and can never have it; he goes on, and tells <hi>how
his Majeſty ſhall purſue his enemies, beſiege Townes, Caſtles, Forts, Ruine us, have great ſucceſſe
in all his Deſignes: Cum multis aljis, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lilly.</hi> This muſt needes be a happy election of time, or elſe <hi>George</hi> a ſtickling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
for he pipes out nothing but victory for his Maieſty: Be it granted, that the ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of <hi>Leiceiſter</hi> hath in part verefied ſome part of this prediction, (and a little treaſon
beſides) yet I deny it was ſignifyed by this poſiture, or that the reſt of this mans words
ſhall have like ſucceſſe: Nay, by poſition of <hi>Mars</hi> Lord of the fourth, in the twelfe, his
Majeſty ſhall not keepe that Town very long, or any elſe that he may take in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetiek
martch, without infinite loſſe on his party: <hi>Venus</hi> in her houſe, doth aſſuredly
tell us we ſhall keepe <hi>Eveſham</hi> taken by plaine valour, and were it not for that accurſed
<hi>Cauda</hi> in <hi>Aquarius</hi> we ſhould ſeldome be looſers, but be gayners, but Diviſion and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
have got an habit and live with us, and are your freinds, yea your onely freinds.</p>
               <p>The figure doth at the begining promiſe ſucceſſe, but the end of this martch will be
unlucky, and foreſhew ſome willfull obſtinate Commanders on his Maieſtyes ſide, will
<pb facs="tcp:113034:31"/>
afford us an abſolute victory over you. <hi>George</hi> for pure love, I tell you, there is in the
Army ſuch as the trayterous Butcher in <hi>Leiceſter.</hi> But upon examination, I finde that
the Sunne whom <hi>George</hi> magnifyes ſo much is in ſquare to the Aſcendant, in Coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the <hi>Virgilliae,</hi> twas no ſuch prime time, obſerve the end, waite a few monthes,
and conſider if the Aſtrologer that elected this time for his Maieſty deſerves not more
puniſhment then Maſter <hi>Booker</hi> or <hi>Lilly:</hi> Herein <hi>George</hi> I will make you Judge, an
honour you were never troubled with, nor are capable now, but that the thing is eaſie. See
<hi>Guido</hi> Fol. 480. Whoſe words are: When you will elect a fit time for a King, &amp;c. Let
not the Sunne or Moone be unfortunate or the Sun in a feminine ſigne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let him have
dignity where he is, the Sun in this ſcheame is totally unfortunate, ſo is the Moon an ill
Omen (<hi>George</hi>) to his Maieſty that he will hardly keepe any thing he gets; <hi>Oxford,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(<hi>Locus a quo</hi>) is like to be ſafe awhile and the Judgement therein good, but you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
his Maieſty to infinite danger. Againe, ſee in the ſame Folio theſe words; Conſider
ſaith <hi>Guido,</hi> if in the ſame yeare there had beene or will be an Eclips, and in all electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
avoide that ſigne, and let the two Lights be in Trine or Sextill, the more fortunate
the Lights are, ſo much the better, and ſo the Contrary.</p>
               <p>It is knowne there was a <hi>Lunar</hi> Eclips in <hi>January</hi> in <hi>Leone,</hi> the effects thereof began
in <hi>Aprill,</hi> Continue till the end of <hi>June,</hi> &amp;c. That very Degree wherein the Eclips was,
have you elected to be the Aſcendant of his Maieſtie and his Armyes martch: In <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi>
there is a <hi>Solar</hi> Eclips, &amp;c. In this figure the Moone applyes to a ſquare of the Sun in
fixed ſignes: Beleeve mee, heare is no continuance of your ſucceſſes, not the taking of
ſo many Towns, Forts, or Caſtles, or ſuch routing of our Armyes, as you Maſter <hi>VVhir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
delude the world with. He was none of his Maieſtyes Freinds, that gave Direction
for this martch; the ſequell will tell you ſo, ere you returne to your winter quarters
if any be left for you, Keep Leiceſter if you can, July may give it us againe.</p>
               <p>After ſome evacuated Chollar, <hi>VVharton</hi> burſts out for very ioy into theſe wordes,
<hi>Oh what ſnuffling there will be amongſt the Zelots, before the middle of November.</hi> He goes
on and derides our humiliation, &amp;c. Do ſo ſtill and proſper; God will not be mocked,
whoſe Cauſe we doe maintaine, though I confeſſe not as it ought to be.</p>
               <p>But let me tell you, ſuch ſhall be our victories before the time limited by you be halfe
come, that me thinks I hear the many accurſed oaths the dam-boyes ſpue out both againſt
God and man. Oh what ſculking, ſneaking, running into Corners, mouſe-holes, ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,
Cunny berries, toſſing and tumbling the ungodly out of one County into another,
doe I foreſee: face about Gentlemen ſayes one for our honour, as you did at <hi>Newberry,</hi>
that is with a good pair of heeles, or alls loſt ſay I; Oh the way to <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> from thence
to <hi>Exceter,</hi> then into <hi>Cornewall,</hi> thence into a ſafe harbour, if any can bee found for
Malignants, Now Maſter <hi>VVharton</hi> I leave you, till again provoked by a more able
Aſtrologer, and I deſire you to get into your Accidence againſt the publiſhing of the
next Journall or elſe you will be ſtript out of the remainder of the Prerogative Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
by Maſter <hi>Booker</hi> in his next <hi>Almanack,</hi> to the totall confuſion, and diſhonour of
the Vniverſity that ſuffer ſo weak an Artiſt to be their Standard-bearer; but money and
Learning are equally plentifull in <hi>Oxford.</hi>
