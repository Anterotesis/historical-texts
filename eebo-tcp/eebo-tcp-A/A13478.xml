            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Within a harbour, almost harbourlesse.</l>
            <l>(We giue God thankes) amongst the Rocks we hit,</l>
            <l>Yet were we neither wash'd or sunk, or split.</l>
            <l>Within a Cottage nigh there dwels a Weauer</l>
            <l>Who entertain'd vs, as the like was neuer,</l>
            <l>No meat, no drinke, no lodging (but the floore)</l>
            <l>No Stoole to sit, no Locke vnto the doore,</l>

            <l>Nor any Candlesticke to hold the light,</l>

            <l>Good entertainment, though our cheare was ill.</l>
            <l>The morrow when the Sun with flushed face</l>
            <l>In his diurnall course began to trace,</l>
            <l>The winde exceeding stiffe and strong and tough,</l>

            <l>Our Boate laid safe vpon the Beachy sand</l>
            <l>Whilst we to <hi>Hastings</hi> went or walk'd by land.</l>
            <l>Much (to that Towne) my thankfulnesse is bound,</l>

            <l>Thus desperatly resolud, twixt hope and doubt</l>
            <l>Halfe sunke with launching, madly we went out,</l>

            <l>To <hi>Miching,</hi> or <hi>New Hauen,</hi> we did get.</l>

            <l>Till Friday that we put to sea againe.</l>
            <l>Then mongst our old acquaintance (storms &amp; flaws)</l>

            <l>All dropping drie, like fiue poore Rats halfe drownd</l>
            <l>From succour farre, we halde the Boate on ground:</l>
            <l>Cast out our water, whilst we brauely drop'd,</l>

            <l>Continuall fiercely blowing, West Southwest.</l>
            <l>A Towne call'd <hi>Goreing,</hi> stood neere two miles wide</l>
            <l>To which we went, and had our wants supplide:</l>
            <l>There we relieu'd our selues (with good compassion)</l>
            <l>With meate and lodging of the homely fashion.</l>
            <l>To bed we went in hope of rest and ease,</l>
            <l>But all beleaguer'd with an host of Fleas:</l>
            <l>Who in their furie nip'd and skip'd so hotly,</l>
            <l>That all our skins were almost turn'd to motly.</l>
            <l>The bloudy fight endur'd at least sixe houres,</l>
            <l>When we (opprest with their encreasing powres)</l>
            <l>Were glad to yeeld the honour of the day</l>
            <l>Vnto our foes, and rise and runne away.</l>
            <l>The night before, a Constable there came,</l>
            <l>Who ask'd my Trade, my dwelling, and my name:</l>
            <l>My businesse, and a troope of questions more,</l>
            <l>And wherefore we did land vpon that shore?</l>
            <l>To whom I fram'd my answers true, and fit</l>
            <l>(According to his plenteous want of wit)</l>
            <l>But were my words all true, or if I lyde,</l>
            <l>With neither I could get him satisfide.</l>
            <l>He ask'd if we were Pyrates? we said no,</l>
            <l>(As if we had, we would haue told him so.)</l>
            <l>He said that Lords sometimes would enterprise</l>
            <l>T'escape, and leaue the Kingdome in disguise:</l>
            <l>But I assur'd him on my honest word,</l>
            <l>That I was no disguised Knight or Lord,</l>
            <l>He told me then that I must goe sixe miles</l>
            <l>T'a Iustice there, Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> or else Sir <hi>Giles:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I told him I was loath to goe so farre,</l>
            <l>And he tolde me, he would my iourney barre.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:2778:10"/>Thus what with Fleas, and with the seuerall prat</l>
            <l>Of th'Officer, and his Ass-ociates,</l>
            <l>We arose to goe, but Fortune bad vs stay:</l>
            <l>The Constable had stolne our Oares away.</l>
            <l>And borne them thence a quarter of a mile,</l>
            <l>Quite through a Lane, beyond a gate and stile,</l>
            <l>And hid them there, to hinder my depart,</l>
            <l>For which I wish'd him hang'd with all my hart.</l>
            <l>A Plowman (for vs) found our Oares againe,</l>
            <l>Within a field well fill'd with Barly Graine:</l>
            <l>Then madly gladly out to Sea we thrust,</l>
            <l>Gainst windes and stormes, &amp; many a churlish Gust:</l>
            <l>By <hi>Kingston</hi> Chappell, and by <hi>Rushington,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>By little <hi>Hampton,</hi> and by <hi>Midleton,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To <hi>Bognors</hi> fearefull Rockes, which hidden lie</l>
            <l>Two miles into the Sea, some wet, some drie,</l>
            <l>There we suppos'd our danger most of all,</l>
            <l>If we on those remorcelesse Rockes should fall,</l>
            <l>But by th'Almighties mercy, and his might,</l>
            <l>We Row'd to <hi>Selsey,</hi> where we stay'd all night.</l>
            <l>There, our <hi>necessity</hi> could <hi>haue no Law,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For want of beds we made good vse of Straw,</l>
            <l>Till <hi>Sol,</hi> that olde continuall Trauailer</l>
            <l>From <hi>Thetis</hi> lap, gan mount his flaming Car.</l>
            <l>The weather kept it's course, and blow'd, and rag'd,</l>
            <l>Without appearance it would e're be swag'd,</l>
            <l>Whilst we did passe those hills, &amp; dales, &amp; Downes,</l>
            <l>That had deuour'd great Ships, &amp; swallow'd Towns.</l>
            <l>Thus after sixe or fiue houres toyle at least,</l>
            <l>We past along by <hi>Wittering, West</hi> and <hi>East,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Vpon the Lee shore still the winde full South,</l>
            <l>We came neere <hi>Chichesters</hi> faire Hauens mouth.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:2778:10"/>And being then halfe sunk, and all through wet,</l>
            <l>More fear'd then hurt, we did the Hauen get.</l>
            <l>Thus in that harbour we our course did frame</l>
            <l>To <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> where on Monday morne we came.</l>
            <l>Then to the Royall Fleete we Row'd abord,</l>
            <l>Where much good welcome they did vs afford.</l>
            <l>To the Lord Generall, first my thanks shall be,</l>
            <l>His bounty did appeare in gold to me,</l>

            <l>Of such command, that none can passe those Seas</l>
            <l>Vnsunk, or spoil'd, except the Castle please.</l>
            <l>On Thursday we, our Boat row'd, pull'd and hal'd</l>

            <l>We still were sure to be halfe sunk, and wet.</l>

<pb facs="tcp:2778:12"/>
for the well or ill disposing of them: so that man hauing nothing but what he hath receiued, and receiued nothing but what is to be imployed in the seruice of God, and consequently his Prince and Countrey, it is plainely to be perceiued, that euery man hath,<note place="margin">No man is owner of himselfe.</note> the least share or portion of himselfe to boast of.</p>
            <p>I haue written this Preamble, not onely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme such as know not these things already; but also to such whose knowledge is, as it were fallen into a dead sleepe, who doe liue as though there were no other being then here, and that their life and being was ordained onely of themselues, neither God, Prince, or Countrey, hauing no share or portion of them or of what they call theirs. But oh you Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitans of <hi>Salisburie,</hi> I hope there are no such craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Cankerwormes, or Common-wealth Caterpillers amongst you. Nay, I am assured of the contrary, that there are many who (with religious piety open hands and relenting hearts) doe acknowledge that your goods are but lent in trust vnto you, and doe patiently beare the ouer-burthensome relieuing of many hundreds of poore wretches, which (were it not for your charity) would perish in your streetes.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2778:12"/>
made bold to write this Treatise ensuing, both to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat a constant perseuerence in those who haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to doe good workes, and an encouragement or animating of all others, who as yet seeme slowe in these good proceedings. And if any thing here writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by me, be either impertinent, extrauagant, rude, harsh, or ouer bold, I humbly entreate you to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it rather to my want of iudgement, learning, and capacity, then to any presumption, or want of loue and duty to the Citie and cause, which is hereafter handled.</p>
            <p>It is sufficiently knowne that my intent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose at this time, was not to make any profit to my selfe vpon any aduenture (as it is deemed by many) by my passage from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Salisbury</hi> with a Wherry,<note place="margin">His name is <hi>Gregory Bastable,</hi> and his ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place where he plyes, or attends his labour, is at the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and there also plyes <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Estman</hi> another Wiltshire man, which went with me.</note> but I was entreated by a Waterman, which was borne in <hi>Salisbury,</hi> that I would beare him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for the discouery of the sands, flats, depthes, shoales, Mills, and Weares, which are impediments and lets, whereby the Riuer is not Nauigable from <hi>Christ-Church,</hi> or the Sea to <hi>Salisbury.</hi> Which after many dangerous gusts, and tempestuous stormes at Sea, (which I haue recited in verse before) it pleased God that at the last we entred the Riuer, which in my opinion is as good a Riuer, and with some charge may be made as passable as the Riuer of <hi>Thames</hi> is vpwards from <hi>Brentford</hi> to <hi>Windsor,</hi> or beyond it; the shallow places in it are not many, The Mills neede not be remoued, and as for the Weares, no doubt but they may with conscience be compounded for. By which meanes of Nauigation, the whole City and Countrey would be relieued, loyterers turned
<pb facs="tcp:2778:13"/>
into labourers, penurie into plenty, to the glory of God, the dignity and reputation of your Citie, and the perpetuall worthy memory of all benefactors, and well-willers vnto so noble a worke.</p>
            <p>If you will but examine your owne knowledges, you shall finde that in the whole dominion of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> there is not any one Towne or Citie which hath a Nauigable Riuer at it, that is poore, nor scarce any that are rich which want a Riuer with the benefits of Boates: The Towne of <hi>Kingston</hi> vpon <hi>Hull</hi> in York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire, the Riuer there was cut out of <hi>Humber,</hi> by mens labours 20. miles vp into the Countrey, and what the wealth and estate of that Towne is, (by the onely benefit of that Riuer) it is not vnknowne to thousands: but you men of <hi>Sarum</hi> may see what a commodity Nauigation is, neerer hand; there is your neighbour <hi>Southampton</hi> on the one side, and your deere friend <hi>Poole</hi> on the other, are a payre of han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some looking-Glasses for you, where you may see your want in their abundance, and your negligence in their industry.</p>
            <p>God hath placed your being in a fertile soyle, in a fruitfull valley, enuironed round with Corne, and as it were continually besieged with plenty: whilst you within (hauing so many poore amongst you) are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lookers vpon happinesse then enioyers: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer (by Gods appointment) Nature hath saued you the labour of cutting a Riuer, for I thinke you haue one there as olde as your Citie ready made to your hands, if you will bee but industrious to amend those impediments in it, I dare vndertake to be one of the 3. or 4. men which shall bring or carie 16. or
<pb facs="tcp:2778:13"/>
20. Tunnes of goods betwixt the Sea and your Citie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now, with extreame toyle of men; Horses &amp; Carts, your wood is brought to you 18. or 20. miles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the poore which cannot reach the high prices of your fewell, are enforced to steale or starue in the Winter, so that all your neere adioyning woods are continually spoyled by them: which faults by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Riuer would be reformed, for the new Forrest standeth so neere to the water, that it is but cut the wood and put it into a Boate, which shall bring as much to your Citie as 20. Carts, and foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score Horses: besides, by this Riuer you might draw to you a trade of Sea-coale, which would enrich you, and helpe the plaine and inland Townes and Villages where no wood growes. And for the Exportation of your Corne from Port to Port, within our owne Countrey, as it is well knowne what abundance of your Barley is continually made into Mault amongst you: which if you had cariage for it, might be brewed into Beere, wherewith you might serue diuers places with your Beere, which is now serued with your Mault: besides cariages of Brickes, Tyles, Stones, Charcoales, and other necessaries, which is now ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at deere rates by Horse or Carts, which now you send in Carts, or on Horses backes, to <hi>Southampton,</hi> to <hi>Bristow,</hi> and to many other places: so that the deerenesse of the Cariages eates vp all your commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and profit, which discommodity may be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if your Riuer be cleansed: and what man can tell what good in time may redownd to your Citie from the Sea, by forraigne goods, which may be brought into <hi>Christ-Church</hi> Hauen by Shipping? nor can it
<pb facs="tcp:2778:14"/>
be truly imagined, what new and vsefull profitable businesses may arise in time by this meanes.</p>
            <p>Our Forefathers and Auncestors did in their liues time in former ages doe many worthy and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable workes, but for all their industrie and cost, they did not (or could not) doe all; but as there was much done to our hands, so there was much left for vs to doe, and very fitting it was that it should be so, for it is against common sence and reason our Fathers should toyle in good workes like drudges, and wee spend our times loytring like Drones: no, what they did was for our imitation. And withall, that wee should be leaders of our posterities by our examples into laudable endeuours, as our progenitours hath before shewed vs: we are their sonnes and offspring, wee haue their shapes and figures, wee beare their names, we possesse their goods, we inherit their lands; we haue materials of stones, Timber, Iron, and such necessaries which they had, (if not in greater abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance) and hauing all these, let vs withall haue their willing and liberall hearts, and there is no question to be made, but that our Riuer of <hi>Auon</hi> will quickly be cleansed to the honest enriching of the rich, and the charitable relieuing of the poore.</p>
            <p>I am assured that there are many good men in the Citie &amp; Country of <hi>Wiltshire,</hi> and others of worth and good respect in this Kingdome, who would willingly &amp; bountifully assist this good work: but <hi>(like Gossips neere a Stile)</hi> they stand straining curtesie who shal go first: or the Mice in the Fable, <hi>not one will aduenture to hang the Bell about the Cats neck,</hi> So that if one good man would begin, it would be (like a health drank
<pb facs="tcp:2778:14"/>
to some beloued Prince at a great feast) pledged most heartily, and by Gods grace effected most happily.</p>
            <p>You haue already begun a charitable worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, I meane your common Towne Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, the profit of which you entend shall be wholy imployed for the supply of the poore and Impotents which liue in your Citie; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which sort of people (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a multitude) the Brewers there haue found their best custome; for no doubt but the meanest beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger amongst you, is (in some sort) more valiant then the richest man: because the one dares to spend all he hath at the Alehouse, so dares not the other; for the poore man drinks stifly to driue care away, and hath nothing to loose, and the rich man drinks moderatly, because he must beare a brain to look to what he hath. And of all Trades in the world a Brewer is the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, which drawes the customs of all functions vnto it. It is the marke or vpshot of euery mans ayme, and the bottomlesse whirlepoole that swallowes vp the profits of rich and poore. The Brewers Art (like a wilde Kestrell or vnmand Hawke) flies at all games; or like a Butlers box at Christmasse, it is sure to win whosoeuer looses: In a word, it rules and raignes (in some sort) as <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> did, for it taxeth the whole earth. Your Innes and Alehouses are Brookes and Riuers, and their Clyents are small Rills and Springs, who all (very dutifully) doe pay their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to the boundlesse Ocean of the Brewhouse. For all the world knowes, that if men and women did drinke no more then sufficed Nature, or if it were but a little extraordinary now and then vpon occasion, or by chance as you may terme it; if drinking were vsed
<pb facs="tcp:2778:15"/>
in any reason, or any reason vsed in drinking, I pray yee what would become of the Brewer then?<note place="margin">Some make a profit of quarelling, some picke their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings out of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, some thriue and grow fat by gluttonie: many are brauely maintained by Bribery, theft, chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, rogue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, &amp; villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: but put all these together, and ioyne to them all sorts of people else and they all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall are drinkers, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Clients and Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</note> Surely wee doe liue in an age wherein the seauen deadly sinnes are euery mans Trade and liuing. Pride is the maintainer of thousands, which would else perish; as Mercers, Taylers, Embroyders, Silk-men, Cutters, Drawers, Sempsters, Laundresses, of which functions there are millions which would starue but for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame Pride with her changeable fashions. Leachery, what a continuall crop of profit it yeelds, appeares by the gallant thriuing, and gawdy outsides of many he and she, priuate and publike sinners, both in Citie and Suburbs. Couetousnesse is Embroidered with Extortion, and warmely lined &amp; furred with oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. And though it be a deuill, yet is it most Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trously adored, honoured, and worshipped, by those simple Sheepe-headed fooles, whom it hath vndone and beggered. I could speake of other vices, how profitable they are to a Common-wealth; but my inuention is thirsty, and must haue one carouse more at the Brewhouse, who (as I take it) hath a greater share then any, in the gaines, which spring from the worlds abuses: for Pride is maintained by the humble, yet one kinde of Pride doth liue &amp; profit by another: Leachery is supported by the cursed swarme of Bawdes, Panders, Pimps, Applesquires, Whores, and Knaues, and so euery sinne liues and thriues by the members, Agents, Ministers, and Clyents, which doe belong vnto them: but Drunkennesse playes at all, all trades, all qualities, all functions and callings can be drunk extemporie, not at any great Feast, or but at euery ordinary dinner or supper almost, when
<pb facs="tcp:2778:15"/>
men are well satisfied with sufficiency, that then the mysterie of quaffing begins, with healths to many an vnworthy person (who perhaps would not giue the price of the Reckoning to saue all them from hanging (which make themselues sicke with drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king such vnthankfull healths) I my selfe haue often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dined or sup'd at a great mans Boord, and when I haue risen, the seruants of the house hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd me into the Seller or Buttry, where (in the way of kindenesse) they will make a mans belly like a Sowse-tub, and inforce me to drinke as if they had a commission vnder the deuills great seale to murder men with drinking, with such a deale of comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall oratory, <hi>As, off with your Cup, winde vp your bottome,</hi> vp with your taplash, and many more elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent phrases, which <hi>Tully</hi> or <hi>Demosthenes</hi> neuer heard of; that in conclusion I am perswaded three dayes fasting would haue beene more healthfull to me, then two houres feeding and swilling in that manner.</p>
            <p>If any man hang, drowne, stabbe, or by any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent meanes make away his life, the goods and lands of any such person, is forfeite to the vse of the King: and I see no reason but those which kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with drinking, should be in the same estate and be buryed in the highwayes, with a stake droue through them: And if I had but a graunt of this suite, I would not doubt but that in seauen yeeres (if my charity would but agree with my wealth) I might erect Almes-houses,<note place="margin">Let these Lines be considered if I lye or not.</note> Free-schooles, mend highwaies, and make Bridges; for I dare sweare, that a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (almost numberlesse) haue confessed vpon their
<pb facs="tcp:2778:16"/>
death-beds, that at such and such a time, in such and such a place, they dranke so much which made them surfeit,<note place="margin">Let these Lines be considered if I lye or not.</note> of which surfeit they languished and dyed. The maine benefit of these superfluous and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaughtering expences comes to the Brewer, so that if a Brewer be in any office, I hold him to be a very ingratefull man if he punish a Drunkard, for euery stiffe pot-valiant drunkard is a Post, beame, or Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler which holds vp the Brew-house: for as the barke is to the tree, so is a good drinker to a Brewer.</p>
            <p>But you men of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> wisely perceiuing how much <hi>Euill</hi> to your Citie, hath come by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse of <hi>Good</hi> drinke, you would now worke by contraries, to drawe <hi>Good</hi> for your poore out of these forepassed and present <hi>Euils.</hi> To drawe euill out of good is deuillish, but to worke or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract goodnesse out of what is euill is godly, and worthy to be pursued. The abuse of good drinke, and excessiue drinking hath made many beggers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you, to the inriching of a few Brewers, and now you would turne the world off from the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, as I would off from the Coach-wheeles, that the benefit of your new built Towne Brew-house might relieue many of those poore amongst you, who haue formerly beene impouerished by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of your Towne-Brewers. It is no doubt but they will oppose this good worke of yours, as the Image-makers in <hi>Ephesus</hi> did <hi>Paul,</hi> when <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> preached against their Idolatrous worshipping <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tobyah. Arabians. Amonites.</hi>
               </note> but be not you discouraged, for <hi>Nehemiah</hi> (in time) did build the Temple, although <hi>Sanballat</hi> and many others did oppose him, for as your intents are
<pb facs="tcp:2778:16"/>
Pious, so no doubt but God will make your euents prosperous.</p>
            <p>Now to turne from Beere and Ale to faire water, (your Riuer I meane) which if it be clensed, then with the profit of your towne-Brewhouse, and the commodity of the Riuer, I thinke there will be scarce a begger or a loyterer to be found amongst you: I haue written enough before concerning the benefit of it, and to encourage such as seeme slow towards so good a worke, which had it beene in the Low-Countries, the Industrious Dutch would not so long haue neglected so beneficiall a blessing, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse their aboundance of Nauigable Riuers, and ditches, which with the onely labour of men they haue cut, and in most places, where neuer God or Nature made any Riuer; and lately there is a Riuer made nauigable to <hi>St. Yeades</hi> in <hi>Huntington-shire,</hi> wherein stood seauen Mills as impediments in the way. And now the Citie of <hi>Canterbury</hi> are cleering their Riuer that Boates may passe to and fro betwixt them and <hi>Sandwich</hi> hauen: the like is also in hand at <hi>Leedes</hi> in <hi>Yorkeshire</hi>; Now, if neither former or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent examples can moue you, if your owne wants cannot inforce you, if assured proffit cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade you, but that you will still be neglectiue and stupid, then am I sorry that I haue written so much, to so little purpose, but my hopes are otherwaies; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> blinde, lame, and couetous excuses be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, then those who are willing will be more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and those who are slacke or backward, will in some reasonable manner drawe forward: And there is the mouth of an vncharitable obiection which I
<pb facs="tcp:2778:17"/>
must needs stop, which is an old one, and onely spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by old men, for (say they) we are aged and stricken in yeares, and if we should lay out our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, or be at charges for the Riuer, by the course of Nature we shall not liue to enioy any proffit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite our costs; this excuse is worse then Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, and therefore it ill becomes a Christian, for as I wrote before, man was not created, or had either the goods of minde, body, or <hi>Fortune</hi> bestowed on him by his Maker, but that he should haue the least part of them himselfe, his God, Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, claiming (as their due) almost all which euery man hath. The oldest man will purchase land, which is subiect to barrennesse, and many inconueniences, he will buy and build houses, which are in danger of fire, and diuers other casualties, he will aduenture vpon Wares or goods at high prises, which to his losse may fall to lowe rates: he will bargaine for cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell and Sheepe, who are incident to many diseases, as the Rot, the Murraine, and diuers the like, and all this will he doe in hope to raise his state, and leaue his heires rich; at his death perhaps (when hee can keepe his goods no longer, when in spight of his heart he must leaue all) he will giue a few Gownes, and a little money to Pious vses, a Groce or two of penny loaues, and there's an end of him, so that there remaines no more memory of him.</p>
            <p>But this good worke of your Riuer is not subiect to barrennesse or sterilitie, but contrarily it will be a continuall haruest of plenty, it is not in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing consumed, or wasted, but it is assured of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall encrease. The names and memories of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributors
<pb facs="tcp:2778:17"/>
towards it, shall be conserued in venerable and laudable remembrance, to the eternizing of their fames, the honour of their posterities, and the good example of succeeding times to imitate. Therefore you men of <hi>Salisbury</hi> I entreate you in this case to be good to your selues. Or else you may say here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, <hi>If we had beene Industrious we had beene hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: If we had not beene couetous, wee had beene Rich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, to returne to my trauels and entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: as I passed vp the Riuer at the least 2000. Swans like so many Pilots swam in the deepest pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before me, and shewed me the way: When I came to the Towne of <hi>Ringwood</hi> (14 miles short of <hi>Salisburie</hi>). I there met with his Maiesties Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peters, and there my fellows Mr. <hi>Thomas Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Richard Stocke,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Ramsey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Randall Lloyd,</hi> with others, which I name not, did walke on the banke and gaue me two most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celent flourishes with their Trumpets, for the which I thanke them in print, and by word of mouth. At last I came to a Towne called <hi>Forthing Bridge,</hi> where (not many dayes before) a grieuous mischance hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for two men being swimming or washing in the Riuer, a Butcher passing ouer the bridge (with a Mastiffe Dogge with him) did cast a stone into the water and say a Duck, at which the Dog leapd into the Riuer and seasd vpon one of the men and kild him, and the Butcher leaping in after thinking to saue the man, was also slaine by his owne Dog, the third man also hardly escaping, but was likewise bitten by him.</p>
            <p>From thence I passed further, to a place called
<pb facs="tcp:2778:18"/>
               <hi>Hale,</hi> where we were welcommed by the Right Worshipfull Sir <hi>Thomas Penrudduck</hi> Knight, whom we carried there in our Boate, and who I am assured will be a forward and a liberall Benefactor towards cleering of the Riuer.</p>
            <p>So passing on our course by the Villages of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, Breamer, Chartford, Downton,</hi> and <hi>Stonelye,</hi> we came at last to <hi>Langfoord,</hi> where we were well entertained by the Right Honourable the Lord <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Gorge,</hi> (Lord barron of <hi>Dundalke,</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of his Maiesties strong and defencible Castle of <hi>Hurst,</hi> in <hi>Hantshire</hi>) to whom in loue and duty we profferd the gift of our tattered windshaken and weatherbeaten Boate, which (after our being at <hi>Salisbury,</hi> being but two miles from thence) his Lordship accepted. And though he knew she was almost vnseruiceable, yet his noble bounty was such, that he rewarded vs with the price of a new Boate. I had some conference with his Honour concerning the impediments and clensing of the Riuer, and I know he is most forwardly and worthily affected towards it, and no doubt if it be pursued, that then he will doe that which shall become a Gentleman of his Honourable calling and Ranke.</p>
            <p>So on the same Friday at night we came to <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> where we brought our Boate through <hi>Fisherton</hi> Bridge, on the West side of the Citie, taking our lodging at the signe of the Kings head there, with mine Host <hi>Richard Estman,</hi> whose brother <hi>Thomas,</hi> was one of the Watermen which came in the Boate thither from <hi>London</hi>; on the morrow I with my company footed it two miles to <hi>Wilton,</hi> where at the
<pb facs="tcp:2778:18"/>
Right Honourable the Earle of <hi>Pembrooks,</hi> my Lord Chamberlaines house, I was most freely (and beyond my worth and merit) kindely welcommed, by the Right Worshipfull Sir <hi>Thomas Morgan</hi> Knight, with whom I dined, and by whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand I was shewed all or the most part of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable contriued Roomes, in that excellent, and well built house, which Roomes were all richly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with Costly and sumptuous hangings; his Maiestie some few dayes before hauing dined there with most magnificent Entertainment, as did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the loue of so noble a House-keeper for so Royall a Guest: vpon the sight of which house with the Furniture, I wrote these following verses.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>If Wholsome Ayre, Earth, woods, &amp; pleasant springs</l>
               <l>Are Elements, whereby a house is grac'd:</l>
               <l>If strong and stately built, contentment brings,</l>
               <l>Such is the house at <hi>Wilton,</hi> and so plac'd.</l>
               <l>There Nature, Art, Art-Nature hath embrac'd;</l>
               <l>Without, within, belowe, aloft compleate:</l>
               <l>Delight and state, are there so enterlac'd</l>
               <l>With rich content, which makes all good, and great</l>
               <l>The Hangings there, with Histories repleate</l>
               <l>Diuine, profane, and Morrall pleasures giuing</l>
               <l>With worke so liuely, exquisite, and neate,</l>
               <l>As if mans Art, made mortall creatures liuing.</l>
               <l>In briefe, there all things are compos'd so well,</l>
               <l>Beyond my pen to write, or tongue to tell.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Then was I shewed a most faire and large Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, with all manner of prouision and Furnitue, for
<pb facs="tcp:2778:19"/>
Pike, Shot, Bills, Halberts, Iauelins, with other Weapons and munition, which for goodnesse, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and well-keeping, is not second to any Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans in <hi>England</hi>: Afterwards I went to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and saw my Lords great Horses, whom I saw such and so good, that what my vntutour'd Pen cannot sufficiently commend, I am forced with si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to ouerpasse. But amongst the rest, the paines and industrie of an ancient Gentleman Mr. <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Gilbert,</hi> must not be forgotten, for there hath he (much to my Lords cost and his owne paines) vsed such a deale of intricate Setting, Grafting, Planting, inocculating, Rayling, hedging, plashing, turning, winding, and returning circular, Trianguler, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dranguler, Orbiculer, Ouall, and euery way curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and chargeably conceited: There hath he made Walkes, hedges, and Arbours, of all manner of most delicate fruit Trees, planting and placing them in such admirable Artlike fashions, resembling both diuine and morrall remembrances, as three Arbours standing in a Triangle, hauing each a recourse to a greater Arbour in the midst, resembleth three in one, and one in three: and he hath there planted certaine Walkes and Arbours all with <note place="margin">Not a Tree stands there, but it beares one good or rare fruit or other.</note> Fruit trees, so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and rauishing to the sense, that he calls it <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,</hi> in which he plaies the part of a true <hi>Adamist,</hi> continually toyling and tilling. Moreouer, he hath made his Walkes most rarely round and spacious, one Walke without another, (as the rindes of an Onion are greatest without, and lesse towards the Center) and withall, the hedges betwixt each Walke are so thickly set, that one cannot see thorow
<pb facs="tcp:2778:19"/>
from the one walke, who walkes in the other: that in conclusion, the worke seemes endlesse,<note place="margin">
                  <p>A round worke is endlesse, hauing no end.</p>
                  <p>I touch not the match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning wood and walkes of <hi>Rowlington</hi> here, whose praises co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in it selfe, my pen being insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
               </note> and I thinke that in <hi>England</hi> it is not to be fellowed, or will in hast be followed. And in loue which I beare to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of so industrious and ingenious a Gentleman, I haue written these following Annagrams.</p>

               <l>Art redily began a breeding tryal</l>
               <l>When she inspir'd this worthy Gentleman</l>
               <l>For <hi>Natures</hi> eye, of him tooke full espiall,</l>
               <l>And taught him <hi>Art, Art redily began,</hi>

               <l>That though Dame <hi>Nature,</hi> was his Tuteresse, he,</l>

            </lg>
            <p>THus with my humble thankes to Sir <hi>Thomas Morgan,</hi> and my kinde remembrance to all the rest of my Lords Seruants there, My legges and my labouring lynes returne againe to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and from the next day (being Sunday) to <hi>Langford</hi> to my Lord <hi>Gorge</hi> his house, with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I dined, &amp; left my humble thanks for the reckoning. In briefe, my fruitlesse and worthy lip-labour, mixt with a deale of Ayrie, and
<pb facs="tcp:2778:20"/>
non-substantiall matter I gaue his Lordship, and the like requitall I bestowed on the right Worshipfull M. <hi>Thomas Squibb,</hi> Mayor of <hi>Sarum,</hi> with M. <hi>Banes,</hi> M. <hi>Iohn Iuy,</hi> M. <hi>Windouer,</hi> with all the rest; and more then thankes, and a gratefull remembrance of their Honourable, Worshipfull, and friendly fauours, I know they expect not, and lesse then such a common duty as Gratitude I must not, or cannot pay. To shut vp all in few words, I know his Maiesties pious inclination is so ample, that he will be graciously plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with any of your laudable endeuours for your welfare and commodity, if you take good and spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy aduice, then no doubt but the effects will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your honest intendments.</p>
            <p>So farewell <hi>Salisbury</hi> till we meete againe, which I hope will be one day: in the meane space I pray thee take this poore Pamphlet as a louing pledge of my returne. Me thinks I see already, Men, Horses, Carts, Mattocks, Shouels, Spades, Wheelebarrowes, Handbarrowes, and Baskets at worke for the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of your Riuer: But if my <hi>thoughts</hi> doe deceiue me, and my <hi>expectation</hi> faile, I shall euer hereafter giue small credit to their intelligence. So once more <hi>Salisbury</hi> I wish thee thankfully well to fare.</p>
            <p>On Thursday the 21. of <hi>August,</hi> I tooke <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> in my way homewards; where I saw an ancient Citie, like a body without <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> soule: and I know not the reason of it, but for aught which I perceiued, there were almost as many Parishes as people. I lodged at the signe of the Cock, being recommended to the Host of the house, by a token from <hi>Salisbury,</hi> but mine Host dyed the night before I came, and I being
<pb facs="tcp:2778:20"/>
weary, had more minde to goe to bed then to follow him so long a iourney, to doe my messuage, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any commendations: but the whole Citie see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med almost as dead as mine Host, and it may be they were all at Haruest worke: but I am sure I walked from the one end of it to the other, and saw not 30. people of all sorts: So that I thinke if a man should goe to <hi>Winchester</hi> for a <hi>Goose,</hi> he might lose his labour for a Trader cannot liue there, by venting such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>
            <p>On Friday I gallop'd a foote pace one and twenty miles, from <hi>Winchester</hi> to <hi>Farneham</hi>; where I and one of my company hired a couple of <hi>Hampshiere</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets with seauen legs, and three eyes betwixt them, vpon whom wee hobled seauenteene miles, to <hi>Stanes,</hi> whence on Saturday the 23. of August we footed it to <hi>Brent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord,</hi> and Boated it to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DON.</p>
