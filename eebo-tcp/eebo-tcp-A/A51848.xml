            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the Learned Ages of the
World, it hath ever been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
difficult to suit Books to
the patronage of the Learned, Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and Impartial; such as they
know you are, who know you. And
when such Pieces are prepared, and
ready to be sent abroad, it is not easy
to make choice of a Patron worthy
of such a Treatise. This presented
<pb facs="tcp:64994:3"/>
to your Lordship, worthy of a good,
hath found out the best Patron; and
like the incomparable History of

manner of writing, and in its Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron

in the Pen that dedicates it. The
things it treateth of, express much
of your Honour's Sentiments,
Wishes, Value, and Endeavours, to
keep the Root of Christianity flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing,
that Christians may answer
their ancient Character, <hi>Vivimus, non

moderation which adorns the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
it does with candor represent
things in which many now dissent,
that 'twould be happy for the <hi>Church
of Christ,</hi> if all would, on such terms,
forbear each other, bear one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Infirmities, and shew that they
believe <hi>the Lord is at hand.</hi> Here I
think is rightly stated what are the
<pb facs="tcp:64994:3"/>
lesser, what are the weightier Things
of the Law; and here are Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which (if follow'd) would
keep Peace and Love among Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and perfect Holiness in the
Fear of the Lord. The Author en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
that sight, which Holiness and
Peace here recommended, did lead
him, and will lead others unto. He

those and other his Labours, which
were design'd to help others to
Happiness also. Be pleased to give
the Publisher leave to send this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

your Honour's Name and Favour,
which may induce some to read and
consider what you approve, and

Christ's Plea for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with Publicans and
Sinners, at which the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
took offence.</p>
                  <p>Three Answers he maketh;</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>From their Necessity, represented in
a proverbial Speech;</hi> The Whole need not a
Physician, but they that are sick.</p>
                  <p>2. From the end of his Commission,
<hi>I came not,</hi> as the Doctor of the Church,
<hi>to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Here is a third suggested in the
words read to you, by a saying of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64994:6"/>
Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi> Chap. 6. 6. where a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Reason is intimated, that a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Levitical Law must not hinder a
necessary Duty of the Moral Law. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his conversing with them for their
Edification, was not unlawful nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely;
for all Rituals must give way to
Morals. And so those Laws of not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying
with an Heathen, or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
Person, were never intended to be
a Bar to an Act of Mercy or Charity, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
spiritual Mercy and Charity. And
therefore though they held the Publicans
prophane, and unworthy their Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(therein also stretching the Law)
yet Christ, without any breach of <hi>deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
might converse with them for their
good. For if Acts of Mercy and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be to be preferred before the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Worship of God, this Act of
rescuing and saving a Soul, is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before all these ritual Restraints of
Conversation, with those who were sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be unworthy, or legally unclean.
And 'tis notable, these words are brought,
not only to vindicate this Fact of Christ,
but secretly to tax the Pharisaical Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy
of those, who place Religion in Ritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
more than Morals. Elsewhere you find
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64994:6"/>
Christ at this Argument again on another
Occasion, but to the same End and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 7. When the Pharisees
frowned; because the Disciples plucked
Ears of Corn for their Necessity on the
Sabbath-day; <hi>If you had known what this
meaneth, I will have Mercy and not Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
you would not have condemned the
Guiltless.</hi> So that this one Sentence is
notably useful to condemn Pharisaism;
or, which is all one, close Hypocrisy, and
withal to set us right in the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>In the words observe:</p>

                  <p>2. The Words of the Prophet quoted.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And in the other place, <hi>If you had
known what this meaneth.</hi> This sheweth
that 'tis a point which deserveth well to
be studied by u's, This saying of the Lord
by the Prophet, <hi>I will have Mercy, and not
Sacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where Observe;</p>
                  <p>1. The form is Negative; but in the
sense 'tis to be understood comparatively;
<hi>I will have Mercy rather than Sacrifice.</hi> So
when <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 17. Christ sent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64994:7"/>
me not to Baptize, but to Preach the Gospel:</hi>
Not chiefly to <hi>baptize,</hi> but <hi>rather</hi> to <hi>preach
the Gospel.</hi> So here 'tis not a simple Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but a Comparative, that he approved
of Moral Duties more than Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>2. Observe; The two things compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> In the Prophet
<hi>Hosea</hi> there is another word, <hi>I desired
Mercy and not Sacrifice, and the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of God more than Burnt-Offerings.</hi>
Mercy comprehendeth the Duties of the
Second Table, as the Knowledg of God
the Duties of the First Table. Now this
Piety towards God, and Charity towards
our Neighbour, was more acceptable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
towards God, than all the Rites of
their External Worship.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> There is much to be learned from
God's expressing himself in his Word;
that he liketh Mercy to them that stand
in need of it, better than the Offering
of the richest Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>I frame the Point so, as it may comply
with Christ's Scope and Purpose.</p>
                  <p>Three things especially we learn in it.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>I. I shall speak to the respective Value
and Preference of Duties; and there I
shall lay down these Propositions.</p>
                  <p>1. All that God commandeth, must be
respected, and Obedience endeavoured:
partly, because his Laws are all Holy, Just,
and Good; Rom. 7. 12. <hi>The Law is Holy,
and the Commandment Holy, Iust, and Good,
viz.</hi> that Law by which he was convinced,
and which had wrought such trouble in
his Heart: <hi>Holy,</hi> as being the <hi>Copy</hi> &amp; <hi>Draught</hi>
of God's Holiness: <hi>Iust,</hi> as doing no Wrong,
no Infringement of our just Freedom: <hi>Good,</hi>
as profitable to direct and perfect our Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;
nothing therein is in vain or
useless. And partly, because they are all
ratified by the same Authority, <hi>Exod, 20.
1. God spake all these words,</hi> not these
words, but <hi>all these words:</hi> He that said,
<hi>Thou shalt not commit Adultery,</hi> said also,
<hi>Thou shalt not Steal;</hi> as the Apostle im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth
the Observation, <hi>Iam. 2. 11. For
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64994:8"/>
he that said, Do not commit Adultery, said
also, Do not kill.</hi> God hath expressed his
Will in one thing as well as another. And
partly, because in Conversion we have
Grace given to obey all; Ephes. 4. 24.
<hi>The new Man is created after God in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
and true Holiness.</hi> 'Tis not only
sitted for Righteousness, but Holiness;
not only for Holiness, but Righteousness.
As the Sun is placed in Heaven, that
he may shed abroad his Influences eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where, and nothing is hidden from
his Heat and Light: So is Grace planted
in the Heart, that it may diffuse it self in
an uniform Obedience, and that we may
be Holy; 1 Pet. 1. 15. <hi>As he that hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
us is holy in all manner of Conversation.</hi>
The Heart is framed to resist every Sin,
and to observe all the Commands of God.
The new Creature never cometh maimed
out of the Birth, or wanting any part.
Well then, Holiness and Righteousness
must ever go together, and the Obedience
to both Tables be inseparable. <hi>We must
serve him in Holiness and Righteousness all
our days,</hi> Luke 1. 75. Not in Holiness
only, or in Righteousness only, but in
both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64994:8"/>2. Though all are to be respected, yet
all Duties are not equal, nor all Sins equal.
A vain Thought is not so heinous a Crime
as the killing of a Man. And to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme
and curse God, is a greater Sin
than an idle Word; and Idolatry, than
stealing of a Shilling. Though all God's
Laws stand by the same Authority, yet
the Matter of all is not of a like moment
and consequence. And therefore the Sins
and Duties are greater and lesser, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the importance of the Law. <hi>Mat.
5. 19. Whosoever shall break one of the least
of these Commandments, and shall teach
Men so to do, shall be least in the Kingdom
of Heaven.</hi> There are Commandments
which may be called the <hi>least,</hi> and there
are others which may be called the <hi>greatest,
In ordine motum,</hi> the Order sheweth the
Weight. The Fundamental Article of
the Covenant, is to have God for our
God, and to prefer Natural Worship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Instituted; the Means stated, before
Manner and Time; God before Man;
Parents before others.</p>
                  <p>3. Simple Duties of the first Table,
are greater than Duties of the Second.
Christ himself saith, <hi>Matth. 22. 38. That
this is the first and great Commandment.</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:64994:9"/>
They must needs be the greatest, because
the Object of them is greatest; <hi>God is
greater than Man,</hi> as 'tis said <hi>Iob</hi> 33. 12.
To oppose a Prince in Person, is more
than to oppose his mean Officer. He that
sinneth against his Neighbour, sinneth
against God, but not so immediately.
1 Cor. 8. 12. <hi>And, 2. because this is the great
Bond on the Heart</hi> to enforce the Duty of
the second, the Conscience of our Duty to
God: because I love, or fear, or would
honour God, therefore I perform my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to Man for the Lord's sake. And so
we turn Second-Table Duties into First-Table
Duties. And so Alms is a Sacrifice,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16. And so Obedience to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
is Obedience to God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 6.
And as they inforce, so they regulate;
for we are to obey them in the Lord, and
so as will stand with an higher Duty we
owe to God. Acts 4. 19. <hi>Whether it be
right in the sight of God, to hearken unto
you more than unto God, judg ye.</hi> So that
these are the greatest Duties; but yet this
must be understood so, as the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
be rightly made; The chief of the
First-Table with the chief of the Second,
the middle with the middle, the least with
the least; Externals with Externals; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64994:9"/>
not: Disobedience to Parents, is
more than an irreverent Speech of God;
Adultery a greater Sin, than coldness in
Worship; stealing, than not giving. The
People made many Prayers, but their
Hands were full of Blood, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 15.
And therefore the Order must be rightly
conceived; first, love to God, then love
to Men; first, the Worship of God,
and then Duty to Men in our several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
first, Acts of outward Worship,
then Acts of outward Respects to Men:
Duties of Piety, and also Justice and
Charity. Thus the Circumstantial and
Ceremonial Duties of the First-Table,
must give place to the necessary and moral
Duties of the Second. But when the
Comparison is duly made in the same
Rank, those Laws which do simply and
directly respect God, are to be preferred
before those Duties which concern Men.
And Sins of the highest Degree against
the first Table, are greater than Sins of
the highest degree against the Second.
And in Duties, the Love of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
must give place to the Love of God.
As the Love of Father and Mother, Wife,
Children, Friends, Brethren; Luke 14.
26. <hi>If any Man hate not Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:64994:10"/>
&amp;c. <hi>he cannot be my Disciple.</hi> God
is chief, and most worthy of respect.</p>
                  <p>4. Moral and Substantial Duties should
chiefly be made Conscience of, and ought
to take place of Ceremonial Observances,
though belonging to the First-Table; for
so in the Text is Mercy preferred before
Sacrifices. Which is to be regarded to a
double end; partly, that we may not rest
in them as the better part of our Duty.
If Men submit never so much to external
Institutions about Religion and Worship,
and think to satisfy their Consciences
therewith, yet they will not at all be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
and approved of God. No: he
looketh more to moral Obedience, than
positive Commands concerning the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals
of Religion. And therefore you
have Morals of the First-Table, or the
Second, often compared with, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
above the Externals of Religion, as
1 Sam. 15. 22. <hi>Hath the Lord any delight in
Burnt-Offerings and Sacrifices? To obey, is
better than Sacrifices; and to hearken, than
the Fat of Rams. Rebellion is as the Sin
of Witchcraft, and Stubbornness as Idolatry.</hi>
'T was spoken upon the occasion of <hi>Saul's</hi>
sparing <hi>Agag,</hi> and the Fat of the Cattel
for Sacrifice, when he was to destroy Man
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64994:10"/>
and Beast. At other times 'tis compared
with Duties of the Second-Table. The
Moral Duties of the Second-Table, are
better than the Ceremonial Duties of the
first. If we be scanty in the one, and
abound in the other, 'tis a Note of an
Hypocrite; Rom. 14. 17, 18. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God standeth not in Meats and
Drinks, but in Righteousness, Peace, and
Ioy in the Holy Ghost.</hi> If a Man do these
things, he shall be accepted of the Lord,
and approved of Men. There are two
Expositions of that place both equally
probable, the one more general. That
Righteousness is taken for all new Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and Peace for Peace of Conscience,
resulting from the Rectitude of our Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and Joy in the Holy Ghost, for super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Comfort, which the Holy Ghost
puts into our Hearts, by reflecting on our
Priviledges by Christ, and the Hopes of
the World to come. Now Christianity lieth
not in outward Observances, but in solid
Godliness. The other Exposition is in a more
limited sense; That by Righteousness, is
meant just dealing; by Peace, a peaceable,
harmless inoffensive sort of living; by Joy in
the Holy Ghost, a delight to do good to one
another, not dividing from, or hating, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring,
excommunicating one another for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64994:11"/>
meer Rituals, but pleasing one another to
Edification. These Morals are more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God, and approved of Men,
than a furious Zeal for lesser things, which
belong to the ritual Part, or external Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Religion. It's an Argument of a
better Spirit, to be more zealous for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
and Substantials, than Rituals; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
without them we shall be of no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
with God. And partly to that,
when Moral Duties come in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with Ceremonial, the Moral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
at that time must take place of the
other, and all positive Commands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Externals of Religion, give
way to them. The Lord never appointed
the Ceremonies of the First-Table, to
hinder Works of Mercy prescribed in
the Second, therefore the Mercy must be
done, and the Sacrifice left undone: as
the Sabbath is both broken and kept, when
there is an evident necessity of preserving
the Creature. When <hi>David</hi> fainted, 'twas
a Moral Duty to relieve him, though
there were no Bread at Hand, but the
Shew-bread; 1 Sam. 21. 4. <hi>There is no
common Bread under my Hands.</hi> And
Christ urgeth that; Mat. 12. 3, 4. <hi>Have
ye not read what</hi> David <hi>did when he was an
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64994:11"/>
hungred; how he entred into the House of
God, and did eat the Shew-bread, which was
not lawful for him to eat; nor for them
which were with him, but only for the Priests?</hi>
In an extraordinary case of Necessity,
the Shew-bread is as common Bread. Now
the Reason is plain, because Positives
bind only in certain Cases, but we are
everlastingly obliged to things Moral.
Therefore Externals must give way both
to Obedience and Mercy. <hi>Internal Acts
of Worship are never dispensed with.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Sacrifices come under a double Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
as they relate to Christ the
substance of them all, or as External
Performances rested in by that People.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>In the first Consideration, their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
lay much in Sacrifices, and the main
Duties of Godliness were exercised about
them, as brokenness of Heart;</hi> Psal. 51.
17. The Sacrifices of God are a broken Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
a broken and a contrite Heart, O God,
thou wilt not despise. <hi>And Faith in Christ,</hi>
Heb. 9. 13, 14. For if the Blood of Bulls,
and Goats, and the Ashes of an Heifer
sprinkling the Vnclean, sanctifyeth to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
of the Flesh: How much more shall
the Blood of Christ, who through the eternal
Spirit, offered himself without spot to God,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64994:12"/>
purge your Consciences from dead Works, to
serve the living God? <hi>And Covenanting
with God,</hi> Psalm. 50. 5. Gather my Saints
together unto me, those that have made a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with me by Sacrifice. <hi>And,</hi> Rom.
12. 1. I beseech you, Brethren, by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God, that ye present your Bodies a
living Sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
which is your reasonable Service.</p>
                  <p>In the second Consideration; The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
bare Offering considered in it self,
without Faith and Repentance, so God
disclaimeth it; Isa. 1. 11. <hi>Bring no more
vain Oblations.</hi> And, <hi>Isa. 66. 2, 3. He
that killeth an Ox, is as if he slew a Man;
He that sacrificeth a Lamb, as if he cut off
a Dog's Neck; He that offereth an Oblation,
as if he offered Swines Blood; He that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Incense, as if he blessed an Idol.</hi> Their
great Confidence was in their Sacrifices.
God therefore sheweth how loathsome
these things were to him, without that
disposition of Soul which should accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
them; being such Persons as those
were, he would take no Offering at their
hands. The Lord in all Ages is Uniform
and like himself, in approving and injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Duty, and in disliking Sin. Morals
are always prized by him before Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64994:12"/>
and an impartial respect to necessary
Duties, was more to him than the greatest
pomp of outward Worship. 'Twas so
then, and 'tis so now; Pride, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
and Envy, are greater Evils than
Ceremonial Uncleanness; and to fear
God, and work Righteousness, a greater
Duty than the best Sacrifices. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of External Duties is not, and
never was a sufficient Testimony of true
Piety; nay, without the Love of God
and Men, and an uniform Obedience to
his Holy Will, is meer Hyprocrisy.</p>
                  <p>6. When the breach of a Ceremonial
Precept bringeth with it the Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Moral Precept, and is (without
any absolute necessity) imposed, in neg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lect
and contempt of the Law of God;
then we are to run all Hazards, rather
than to transgress in the smallest Externals:
because tho the Matter enjoined be but
small, yet the Contempt of God is a great
Sin, and our Sincerity and Obedience to
God is a great Matter. As for Instance;
When <hi>Antiochus</hi> pressed the Jews to eat
Swines-Flesh, which in case of great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
no question they might do; yet
when he pressed them out of Contempt of
the Law, they chose rather to be tortured
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64994:13"/>
to Death, than to yield to it. And for
this they are registred Martyrs, <hi>Heb. 11.
35. They were tortured, not accepting Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
that they might receive a better Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</hi>
There is a plain Allusion to the
Story in the Book of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Eleazar,</hi> and the Woman with her
seven Sons, so cruelly tortured. But these
Commands were contrary to the Laws of
God: Should they have said, <hi>God will
have Mercy, and not Sacrifice?</hi> No, in
such a case God will have Sacrifice, and
not Mercy. Tho often advised to yield, they
would not abate a Jot of their Zeal. For
tho the Case be but in Externals, yet there
is a Renunciation of our Relation and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to God's Law. So <hi>Daniel</hi> ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his Windows, and praying three
times a day, as he was wont to do, <hi>Dan.</hi>
6. 10. That Circumstance might have
been forborn, you will think, in a Case
of such imminent Peril of Life: No, he
would neither forbear praying, nor ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his Windows; he had wont to do
so before, and without dishonouring God,
and renouncing his Profession, he could
not forbear to do so now. The Promise
of Audience, made to <hi>Solomon</hi> at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of the Temple, required this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64994:13"/>
as an Effect of Faith; 1 <hi>Kings 8.
42, 43. When they shall pray towards this
House, then hear thou in Heaven.</hi> And
<hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal. 5. 7. In thy Fear I will
worship towards thy holy Temple.</hi> The Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
did shadow forth the Body of our
Lord Christ, the Mediator, in whom only
our Prayers and Services are accepted
with the Father, which <hi>Solomon</hi> respected
in looking towards the Temple. But the
chief Reason is, the Necessity of Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and open Profession too, against this
impious Law, contrived by the Malice of
his Enemies to make him afraid. Now to
shew he was not frighted from his Duty,
he openeth his Windows, and would not
forgo any Circumstance of his Duty to
God. I might instance in Circumcision,
(as urged by the false Apostles) as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to our Justification; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4.
<hi>Behold, I</hi> Paul <hi>say unto you, that if you
be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
For I testify again to every Man that is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised,
that he is a Debtor to do the whole
Law: Christ is become of none effect unto you.
Whosoever of you are justified by the Law,
you are fallen from Grace.</hi> Such is the
difference when God calleth us to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of a lesser Truth. Therefore the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64994:14"/>
Case may be such, that Externals may
bear great Weight.</p>
                  <p>7. If the Externals of God's Worship
instituted by himself, must give place to
Mercy, then Externals of Humane Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
ought much more to give place to
Mercy. Sacrifices were of God's Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and a way of expressing their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and Thankfulness in his Worship;
yet God saith, <hi>I will have Mercy, and not
Sacrifice.</hi> And twice is this applied by
Christ, to Mercy towards the Souls of
Men in the Text, and Mercy concerning
the Bodies of Men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. to defend
the Disciples rubbing the Ears of Corn,
because they fainted for Hunger. Then by
like Reason, where the urging of Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
may cross Mercy to the Souls of Men,
by depriving them of the Means of Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and the Gifts of a lively Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry;
or crossing Mercy to the Bodies of
Men, by depriving them and their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of their necessary Support and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance:
in such a case they should learn
what that meaneth, <hi>I will have Mercy, and
not Sacrifice.</hi> And the Peace and Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church, is more valuable than
that of a private Man. In all External
positive Institutions, the Apostles often
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64994:14"/>
urge Charity to the Souls of Men, for
which Christ died, that we neither wound
them with Sorrow or Sin; as the sure Rule
to guide us, either in practising, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing
our Liberty: Rom. 14. 15. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
not him with thy Meat for whom Christ
died.</hi> So, 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 11. And through thy
Knowledg shall the weak Brother perish,
for whom Christ died.</hi> That is, the scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Abuse of this Knowledg. In short,
if any great dammage to the Souls or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
scandal or inconveniece should come
upon urging these Externals, surely they
should be forborn: for if it be the Will
and Pleasure of the King of Kings, and
Lord of Lords, that Matters commanded
by his Affirmative Precepts, should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
for Charity's sake; Men should be
perswaded to remit of the rigor of their
Impositions in this kind, though the
things imposed were indifferent, and the
practice of them in some Cases a Duty;
yet if it would destroy Charity, we are
to leave our Prayers, publick and private,
forsake a Sermon, to save the Life of our
Neighbour; nay, to quench the Fire burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his House; nay, to help his Cattle
out of the Ditch. But I will prosecute
this no further.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:64994:15"/>Let me now make some use of what
hath been said.</p>
                  <p>1. Let us take heed that we be not of
the number of them that are serious and
zealous in some things, but not in all.
Partial Zeal hath always been the Note of
Hypocrites; as the Pharisees were earnest
for Externals, but neglected Justice and
Charity. <hi>Saul</hi> is an Instance of Partial
Zeal in destroying the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

but he spared <hi>Agag</hi> out of seeming pity;
but useth barbarous Cruelty in seeking to

this he is said to do in his Zeal. Not a

for it tended much to his dishonour
to have them destroyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who were new
Proselytes, and professing Religion, and had
put themselves under God's Protection;
but a preposterous hypocritical Zeal, of
aiming, as he pretended, at the welfare

Intent was popular Applause, and to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64994:15"/>
them, who envied the Gentiles should
be incorporated into God's People. An
Hypocrite's Conscience is not uniform, but
brought upon the Stage for a Turn. I
shall give you another Instance in <hi>Ieh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</hi>
mighty zealous in destroying the Idolatry
of <hi>Baal,</hi> which was the Idolatry of the
House of <hi>Ahab;</hi> but not only cold and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
but resolute against the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Calves of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> which
was the Idolatry of <hi>Ieroboam;</hi> 2 Kings
10. 28, 29. <hi>Thus</hi> Jehu <hi>destroyed</hi> Baal <hi>out of</hi>
Israel. <hi>Howbeit, from the Sins of</hi> Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,
<hi>wherewith he made</hi> Israel <hi>to sin,</hi> Jehu
<hi>departed not from them, to wit, the Golden
Calves in</hi> Dan <hi>and</hi> Bethel. Reason of
State perswaded the one, and disswaded
the other. His Interest lay in ruining the
House of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and in taking care that
the Tribes might not revert to the House
of <hi>David.</hi> Thus you see Men zealous in
some things, may gri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>vously sin in others.
Therefore, my Beloved, be you careful
to regard all God's Commands in their
place; Piety in its place, Justice in its
place, Mercy in its place. The Jews, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they had smarted in <hi>Babylon,</hi> were zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
against Idols, but robbed God of his
Dues, never took care to restore the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64994:16"/>
Riches of the Temple. Therefore the
Apostle taxeth this partiality of Zeal,
<hi>Rom. 2. 22. Thou that abhorrest Idols, dost
thou commit Sacrilege?</hi> The latter Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
tax them much for that Crime. The
Jewish Form still is hatred of Idolatry, in-so-much
that they think that all the
Plagues that come upon them, is for the
Idolatry of their Fathers, especially in the
si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of the Golden Calf in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and translate the Scene of their
Repentance far enough from themselves,
that they may not see their present Sins,
both in breaking the moral Law, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising
Christ. And every Party is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to have their Form; one special
Commandment which they stuck unto,
which they are zealous for, whilst they
neglect the rest. The reproaches of our
Enemies, saith the Pharisee, are only for
the fourth Commandment, but neglect the
rest; zealous for the Sabbath, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscionable

Commandments, and insist only upon the

I mention these things, to shew what need
we have to be uniform in our Obedience
unto God.</p>
                  <p>I will mention but one Motive. They
that do not obey all, will not long obey
any, but where their Interest or Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

did many things, but one Command
stuck with him, his <hi>Herodias,</hi> and that
bringeth him to murder God's Prophet,
<hi>Mark</hi> 6. 20. One Sin keepeth possession
for Satan, and that one Lust and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may undoe all. A Bird tied by the
Leg, may make some shew of escape; so
do many think themselves at liberty, but
the Fowler hath them fast enough.</p>
                  <p>2. Let us not rest in outward Duties
of Worship, and place our Zeal there,
for that is an ill Spirit that doth so, 'Tis
the Badg of Pharisaism: they keep a fair
correspondence with God in the outward
Duties of his Worship, but in other things
deny their subjection to him; the main
reason is, because Externals of Worship
are more easy than the denial of Lusts.
The sensual Nature of Man is such, that
'tis loth to be crossed, which produceth
prophaneness. Wherefore do Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulph
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64994:17"/>
themselves in all manner of sensua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
but because they are loth to deny
their Natural Appetites and Desires, and
to row against the stream of Flesh and
Blood, and so to walk in the way of his
own H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>art, and the sight of his Eyes?
<hi>Eccles.</hi> 4. 8. If Nature must be crossed,
it shall be crossed only for a little, and in
some slight manner; they will give God
some outward thing, which lieth remote
from the subjection of the Heart to him,
therefore be zealous for Externals; and
this produceth Hypocrisy, gross Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy,
and Dissembling, whereby we deceive
oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>stitutions. And this close Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy
or Partiality of Obedience, is that
whereby we deceive our selves, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in External Actions and Duties, while
we neglect those Substantials wherein the
Heart and Life of Religion most lieth:
such are the Love of God, Contempt of
the World, Mortification of the Flesh,
the Heavenly Mind, and Holy Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Soul, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>irmly set to please God
in all things.</p>
                  <p>Once more; That this Deceit may be
more strong, Men are apt to exceed in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64994:17"/>
outward Observances, or By-laws of their
own: and this produceth Superstition,
either <hi>Negative,</hi> in condemning some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things which God never condemned,
as those Ordinances of Men which the
Apostle speaketh of, <hi>Col. 2. 19. Touch not,

many things as Duties, and crying
them up as special Acts and Helps of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which God never instituted to

for Doctrines the Commandments of
Men.</hi> The Spirit and Genius of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
lieth in this; neglecting many
things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which God commandeth, but mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing
Bonds and Chains of their own
making. Sacrifices enow! God shall
have any thing for the Sin of their Souls,
<hi>Micah</hi> 6. 6, 7. Thus these three great
Evils, Prophaneness, Hypocrisy, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
do all grow upon the same
Stem and Root. First, Men must have an
easy Religion, where the Flesh is not cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
but no mortifying of Lusts, no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
our selves to Godliness. They
can deny themselves in parting with a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
but the weighty things of Piety,
Justice, and Mercy, are neglected; God
shall have Prayers enow; Hearing enough,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64994:18"/>
if the Humor and Temper of the Body
will suit with it. They can fast and gash
themselves like <hi>Baal</hi>'s Priests; whip their
Bodies, but spare their Sins; but the
Heart is not subdued to God. They can
part with any thing better than their
Lusts, and disturb the present Ease of
the Body, by attending on long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Duties, rather than any solid and
serious Piety.</p>
                  <p>II. The next Lesson which we learn is,
The Guise of Hypocrites; for our Lord
intimateth, that these <hi>Pharisees</hi> had great
need to learn the Importance of that
Truth, as being extreamly faulty; <hi>I will
have Mercy, and not Sacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[1.] The first thing notable in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
is a partial Zeal; they have not an
Uniform Conscience, are very exact in
some things, but exceeding defective and
faulty in others. The good Conscience
is intire and universal: Heb. 13. 18. <hi>We
trust that we have a good Conscience, in all
things willing to live honestly.</hi> The sincere
Purpose and Intention of his Heart, was
to direct his Life according to the Will of
God in all things. Tho' every one hath
his failings, yet the Will and constant En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64994:18"/>
of a sincere Heart, is to govern
himself universally according to the Will
of God in all points of Duty, whether
they concern God or Man: as 'tis said of
<hi>Zechary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Luke 1. 6. <hi>That
they walked in all the Ordinances and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of the Lord blameless.</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
Conscience doth approve all; and
the renewed Will, which is the Imperial
Power in the Soul, the first Mover and
Principle of all Moral Actions, is bent and
inclined to obey all; and the New Life is
spent in striving to comply with all. But
'tis not so with Hypocrites, they pick and
chuse out the easiest part in Religion, and
lay out all their Zeal there, but let other
things go. In some Duties that are of
easy digestion, and nourish their Disease,
rather than cure their Soul; none so zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
as they, none so partial as they. Now
a partial Zeal for small things, with a plain
neglect of the rest, is direct Pharisaism;
all for Sacrifice, nothing for Mercy.
Therefore every one of us should take
heed of halving and dividing with God:
If we make Conscience of Piety, let us
also make Conscience of Justice; if of
Justice, let us also make Conscience of
Mercy. 'Tis harder to renounce one Sin
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64994:19"/>
wherein we delight, than a greater which
we do not equally affect. A Man is wedded
to some special Lusts, and is loth to hear
of a divorce from them. We have our
tender and sore places in the Conscience,
which we are loth should be touched.
But if we be sincere with God, we will
keep our selves from all, even from our
own Iniquity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 23. such as is most
incident to us by temper, or custom of
Life, or course of our Interests; to baulk
or break with God, out of private Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Pleasure, Honour, or Profit, or
any corrupt Interest, is to prefer these
things before God, and to set up another
chief Good in our Hearts, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it before his Favour. Thus in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                  <p>[2.] They place all their Godliness
and Righteousness in outward Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
or external Discipline, and so
their Religion is more in the Flesh, and
in the Letter, than in Heart and Spirit.
As the Pharisees rested in outward Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
only, or some external Rules, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the inward and real Duties, either of
the First or Second Table. Mat. 23. 25.
<hi>They cleanse the outside of the Cup and Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but within they are full of Extortion
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64994:19"/>
and Excess.</hi> And, <hi>Vers. 28. Ye appear
outwardly Righteous unto Men, but within
ye are full of Hypocrisy and Iniquity.</hi> And
every where they are represented as pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Tombs without, but had much hidden
Uncleanness and Corruption within.
There was an outward formality and shew
of Religion, when they denied the Power
thereof. They should join Obedience to
God, and Love to their Neighbour, with
their outward Sacrifices; but these things
were of little value and esteem with them.
Now, what Sacrifices were to them, that
External Ordinances are to us. And what
their Rituals were, the same is the Mode
and Garb of Profession among us. And
therefore External Profession, or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of External Duties according to
our way, is not a sufficient Testimony of
true Godliness: For Christ saith, <hi>Mat. 5.
20. Except your Righteousness exceed the
Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees,
ye shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven.</hi> Their Righteousness was an
out-side Righteousness, without that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Constitution of Soul which doth
belong to a renewed Heart, and yet car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on in such a way, and applauded by
Men, that the Jews had a saying, That if
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64994:20"/>
but two Men out of all the World went
to Heaven, the one should be a Scribe,
and the other a Pharisee. Oh Christians!
'tis one thing to approve our selves to
God, who searcheth the Heart; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
thing to approve our selves to
Men, who look only to the out-side, and
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ir appearance without. A renewed
Heart, that is unfeignedly set to please
God in all things, is more than all the
Pomp of External Duties. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we should study to give Evidence of
this, by making Conscience of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as well inwardly as outwardly,
growing in Holiness all the days of our
Lives. This will be comfortable to us,
and this will be approved of God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
even such an Holiness as is manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
in all the parts of our Conversation,
in outward Carriage and secret Practice,
common Affairs, and religious Duties;
In the Worship of God, and Charity,
and Justice to Men: Phil. 3. 3. <hi>We are the
Circumcision which worship God in the Spirit,
and have no confidence in the Flesh.</hi> When
there is a serious Bent, and the true spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Affections of a renewed Heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God and Man; and we do not rest
in outward Duties, but are still growing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64994:20"/>
in internal Grace, Faith, Hope, and
Love, and are still purifying the Heart
and Life, that we may constantly glorify
God, and do good to Men. This is that
which is over and above the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Scribes and Pharisees; our
Duty is to serve God in the Spirit, and
to bring the inward Man in subjection to
him, without which Externals are of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
worth.</p>
                  <p>[3.] They were more in love with
Ceremonies, than with Substance: Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
which belonged to the Ceremonies
of the Law, were in high esteem with
them; but Godliness, Justice, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
were of little regard. And as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
things were preferred before In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
so the lesser things before the
weighty: As to their Duties, tithing Mint,
and Annise, and Cummin; but they have
omitted the weightier Matters of the
Law, Justice, Mercy, Faith. These ought
ye to have done, and not to leave the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
undone, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 23. Formality
and Hypocrisy maketh Men wise about
that which is least to purpose. They make
a business about Ceremonies, but neglect
the Substance of Religion. They enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
their <hi>Phylacteries,</hi> which were Scroles
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64994:21"/>
of Parchment on which the Law was
written, but took no care of having
the Law of God written upon their
Hearts. Hypocrisy is an odd trifling
Zeal, which runneth out upon little things.
So for avoiding Sin, <hi>Matth. 23. 24. They
strain at a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and swallow a Camel:</hi>
More scrupulous in a little Sin, than a
great; in small Sins very scrupulous, in
greater Matters very adventurous. And
because this is one of the main things here
intended, I shall give you <hi>Instances</hi> and
<hi>Reasons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Instances;</hi> to prove that Hypocrites
have such an odd Conscience, that strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
greatly at a small Sin. We have them
every where out of the Word of God.
<hi>Herod's</hi> making Conscience of his Oath,
but not of shedding Innocent Blood.
<hi>The King was sorry: nevertheless for his
Oath's sake,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 9. he caused
<hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> to be beheaded. A Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is holden in Bonds which he might
lawfully break; rather than <hi>Herod</hi> will
break his rash Oath, <hi>Iohn</hi> shall lose his
Head. Of such an odd Complection is
the Conscience of Carnal Men. So the
Jews, when <hi>Iudas</hi> laid down the hire of
his Treason, and cast the Mony at their
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64994:21"/>
feet; Mat. 29. 6, 7. <hi>It is not lawful</hi> (said
they) <hi>to put it into the Treasury, because it
is the price of Blood.</hi> Pretending to be
afraid to offend in the least things, when
they had offended in the greater. They
bogled not at betraying Innocent Blood,
and yet they would not meddle with the
Gain when it was thrown back to them.
Another Instance of the like Conscience,
is, <hi>Iohn 18. 28. Then led they Iesus front</hi>
Caiaphas <hi>into the Iudgment-Hall, and it
was early, and they themselves went not into
the Iudgment-Hall, lest they should be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
but that they might eat the Passover.</hi>
They were careful to avoid legal Polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and yet they were at the same time
seeking the Life of the Lord of Glory.
Just such another fit of Conscience cometh
upon them a little after; <hi>Iohn 19. 31. They
went to</hi> Pilate, <hi>and desired that the Bodies
might not hang upon the Cross on the Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
lest their great Feast should be defiled.</hi>
And thus you see, that through Formality
and Custom, Men may be strictly bound
in Conscience to perform the Duties of
Ceremonial or External Worship, whose
Consciences notwithstanding never scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to violate the most weighty Precepts
of the Law. Just of this Nature was
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64994:22"/>
that solemn Case of Conscience, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.
1, 2. about the keeping of their Fasts,
when the Prophet telleth them they had
higher Matters to mind, the <hi>executing of
Iudgment,</hi> and <hi>shewing Mercy,</hi> and <hi>break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off their Oppressions,</hi> vers. 10. The
Lord would not answer their Cases about
the Fasts: Some of which were needless
and superfluous; but would have them
break off their known Sins. Hitherto
may be reduced the Harlot in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,
that inticed the young Man to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery,
and yet she had her Peace-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings:
<hi>I have Peace-Offerings with me this
day,</hi> Prov. 7. 14. with the 18<hi>th.</hi> Made
Conscience of her Sac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ifices, but not of
her Honesty and Chastity. Yea, also we
may reckon to this rank of Conscience,
the Instance of <hi>Bathsheba.</hi> Even the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God have much Hypocrisy, and
an odd kind of Conscience, when they
give way to wilful and hainous Sin. The
Passage is, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 4. David <hi>took her,
and committed Adultery with her, for she
was purified from her Vncleanness.</hi> That
Uncleanness was Ceremonial only; but
in the mean time she was committing a
Moral Uncleanness, from which she was
not so careful to keep her self. Well then,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64994:22"/>
the Consciences of Men being of such a
make, well might God say, <hi>I will have
Mercy, and not Sacrifice;</hi> Substance, and
not Ceremony. And we have all need
to take heed to our selves, that we do not
boggle and startle at a Shadow, when in
the mean time we are stupid and sensless,
in Sins of another nature and deeper
dye; and preserve a tenderness in lesser
things, when we give way to Injustice
and Oppression.</p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>Reasons</hi> why Hypocrites never
find their Consciences awake so much as
in Matters Ceremonial; I shall give these
two.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Because these are of easiest dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
and will sooner satisfy the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Slight Duties suit best with an Heart
that is unwilling to come under the Power
of Religion. Conscience is like the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
which naturally desireth to fill its
self; and when it cannot digest solid Food,
it sucketh nothing but Wind. They that
place their Confidence in their own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
presently fly to their External
Shows. The right stating of the Duties
of the Law, according to their due weight,
would convince them of their Mistake:
Therefore that the Ell may be no longer
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64994:23"/>
than the Cloth, they confine their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to External Observations, and so
make their Religion as commodious for
themselves as they can. Adultery is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to eating Flesh in <hi>Lent,</hi> or breaking
some External Rule. The Apostle saith,
<hi>going about to establish their own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
they have not submitted to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of God,</hi> Rom. 10. 3. Not to
the way of Solid Righteousness, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken-hearted
acceptance of Christ, but an
external appearance of Duty is most for
their Interest.</p>
                  <p>(2.) To put the better Pretence upon
their vile Practices, therefore they must
have some External Ceremonies to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
them. Thus the Pharisees, to
countenance their Oppressions, <hi>for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
make long Prayers,</hi> Mat. 23. 14. That
made them be trusted by the destitute
Widows, whom they deceived. As <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebel</hi>
would have the formality of a Fast,
for the better colour of her impiety in
destroying <hi>Naboth.</hi> In days of Fasts, they
were wont to enquire after heinous Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
to execute the Law upon them, as
you may see, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 7, 8. and <hi>Psalm.</hi>
106. 30. so to stop God's Wrath. So some
expound that, <hi>Ioel 1. 14. Sanctify a Fast,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64994:23"/>
call a Solemn Assembly, gather the Elders:</hi>
That is, Call a Court who may enquire

cognizance of <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Sin.</p>
                  <p>[4.] They make Conscience, not only
of Externals instituted by God, but most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of those that are devised by themselves.
This very Abstinence from converse with
Publicans, was a thing not forbidden by
the Law, but an Institution of their own;
because of their frequent converse with
Heathens, they looked upon them as a
polluted sort of Men, and unworthy of
their converse. So that this helpeth us
to another Character of Hypocrites, they
are zealous for Humane Traditions, but
Transgressors of Divine Commands, God's
Precepts are little regarded; and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
their own Institutions before the Laws
of God. So, <hi>Mat. 15. 3. By your Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ye transgress the Commands of God:</hi>
Namely, by holding, that if a Man had
devoted his Estate to God, he might chuse
whether he would relieve his Parents.
Men are mightily in love with their own
Customs, and place much Religion in
Man's Injunctions, and care not how they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64994:24"/>
loosen or weaken the Obligation of God's
Law by their Impositions. The Pharisees
great Fault was, they would outdo the
Law in Externals; and then when they
had set their Post by God's Post, they
were more zealous for Man's Inventions,
than for God's Ordinances. And this Zeal
is shewn, either by imposing upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or others. Imposing upon their
own Consciences, when they lie in Chains
of their own making. On others, when
they make their own Practice, the Rule
of others. Mat. 9. 14. <hi>The Pharisees fast,</hi>
John'<hi>s Disciples fast, thy Disciples fast not.</hi>
To this Head we may reduce <hi>Saul</hi>'s rash
restraining the People by his Injunction
and Oath, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 32. with <hi>vers.</hi> 38.
The People had gotten a great Victory,
and <hi>Saul</hi> out of his Hypocritical Zeal,
commandeth them to fast till Evening.
Now what was the Issue? The People
through Faintness could not pursue the
Enemy; <hi>Ionathan</hi> that heard nothing of
this Curse and Oath, was in danger of
his Life; and the People being hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starv'd,
for greediness, did eat the Flesh
and the Blood together, contrary to God's
Law, <hi>Gen. 9. 4. Levit.</hi> 17. 13, 14. Mark
there, though Hunger could not force to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64994:24"/>
transgress <hi>Saul</hi>'s Commandment for fear
of Death, yet it forced them to break
God's express Commandment, in eating
the Blood, which was so expresly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
And at Night, when God answered
him not, <hi>Saul</hi> thought somewhat was in
the Matter, he goeth to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ast Lots, and the
Lot had found out <hi>Ionathan. Saul</hi> never
thinketh of the breach of God's Law;
first by himself, in imposing a rash and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Oath; or of the Peoples sin, in eating
the Blood with the Flesh: and presume<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h
it must needs be the breach of that Oath
which he had imposed, and so like an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,
preferreth his own groundless
Command, before the Law of God, and
of punishing this with rigour, when the
other is never spoken of. I have brought
this Story, to shew you how zealous Men
are for their own Impositions on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and others, and how easily they
can dispense with God's Laws, to comply
with their own. And how Drunkenness,
Whoredom, and Fornication, do not
seem such odious Crimes, as violating
Man's Customs and Institutions, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Rules of their own.</p>
                  <p>[5.] Hypocrites have a Conceit of
their own Righteousness, and a Disdain of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64994:25"/>
others. This was the very Case in the
Text, they were angry because Christ en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into the House of <hi>Matthew,</hi> a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,
and did eat Meat there, though he
had converted him. And else-where 'tis
made the Characteristick Note of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees;
Luke 18. 9. <hi>They trusted in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that they were Righteous, and despised
others.</hi> Men that fly to Externals, are
soon puffed up; and nothing humbleth so
much as a sound sense of Religion; and a
solemn exercising our selves to Godliness,
maketh us see and loath our selves, and pity
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hers. I find the Pharisees Enemies ever to
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>reeness of God's Grace to Sinners, and
the Work of Repentance. And that the
bringing of poor Sinners to Salvation,
was the great eye-sore. They call Christ
<hi>a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ine-bibber,</hi> and <hi>a Friend of Publicans
and Sinners,</hi> because of his social and free,
but sanctified Converse with all sorts of
Men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 18. He would not take
such a strict form as <hi>Iohn</hi> did, because he
would not seem to justify their Pharisaical
Rigors. So again, <hi>Luke 15. 2. This Man
receiveth Sinners, and eateth with them:</hi>
Because he went to them as a Physician to
heal their Souls. Christ refused not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity
with the poorest and worst, as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64994:25"/>
was needful for their Cure, and would not
observe the humour of proud Pharisaical
Separation, by the Parables of the <hi>lost
Sheep,</hi> and the <hi>lost Groat,</hi> but confuteth
it; sheweth that this is the Spirit of the
Elder Brother, who envied the Prodigal's
Return. And telleth them in another
place, that <hi>Publicans and Harlots enter into
the Kingdom of Heaven before them,</hi> Mat.
21. 30. pleadeth the Case of the Woman
against <hi>Simon</hi> the Pharisee, <hi>Luke 7. 30. If
this Man had been a Prophet, he would have
known who and what manner of Woman this
is that touched him. Luke</hi> 7. 47. Christ
telleth him, <hi>She had much forgiven her, for
she loved much.</hi> Well then, a penitent
broken hearted sense of our own being
indebted to Grace, and tender compassion
towards others that yet go astray, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
the true Spirit of the Gospel. But
to stand aloof from others by a foolish
singularity; <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 5. which say, <hi>Stand
by thy self, come not near to me, for I am
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>lier than thou.</hi> Some, though impure
and prophane, counted all others unholy
and unclean but themselves. This inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Spirit is the Spirit of Pharisaism. An
outside strictness without that Faith, Love,
Charity, Meekness, Usefulness, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64994:26"/>
which is the very Soul and Life of
Christianity. Usually Gifts, and outward
strictness, puff up Men with a vain
conceit of their own Righteousness, and
a censuring and despising others. This
one Text sheweth us both the Spirit of
Pharisaism, and the Spirit of Christianity.
The Pharisees who abounded in External
Observances, censured Christ for his free
Converse, disdained these penitent People
whom he invited to a better Life. But
now true Religion maketh Men humble
and lowly in their own Eyes, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
them with the desert of Sin, and
their own Misery; and maketh Men piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and compassionate towards others,
more ready to help than to censure them,
and to use all ways and means to do them
good. But when Men would shine alone
in the repute of Holiness, they are envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to those who penitently return to
their Duty; as those Servants who had
wrought all the day, envied those that
came in at the last hour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 12. or, as
the elder Brother envied the Prodigal, or
<hi>Simon</hi> the Pharisee repined at <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi>'s
observance of Christ. They e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
much of their own Works, Merits,
Sufferings, and Righteousness: O take
heed of this Spirit!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:64994:26"/>The use of this B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>anch, is to press us
to regard Internals more than Externals,
and the Substantials more than the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials
of Worship, and a broken-hearted
thankful sense of our Redeemer's Love,
before a Legal Righteousness. Inward
Worship is Love, Fear, and Trust; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Worship is Prayer, Praise, Hearing,
Reading. Outward Worship is not a
Duty at all times, but inward Worship is
a Duty at all times; for we should always
love God, and delight in God, and trust
in God. Outward Worship may be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for a Work of Mercy, and in case of
invincible Necessities; but inward Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
may never be omitted, never dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with. We always owe Love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
Obedience to God, and must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon him, and delight in him. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Worship may be counterfeited, and
External Worship, without Holiness, is
highly displeasing to God, and never plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
but when 'tis in conjunction with it.
Hypocrites may abound in Externals, but
Hypocrites will not delight themselves in
the Lord, nor heartily devote themselves
to him, so as to serve, please, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
him: the inward Graces cannot be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64994:27"/>
counterfeited, but the outward Expression
may.</p>
                  <p>2. Be more careful of the Substantials,
than of the Ceremonials of Religion;
and to mind the Power of Godliness
more than the Form. The Substantials
of Religion are the Love of God and
our Neighbour. The Circumstantials are
those ways of Worship which God hath
appointed, whereby we are visibly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
our love to him. Now our main
care should be, in the first place, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
devoted and subject to God. That
was <hi>Iob</hi>'s Character, <hi>One that feared God,
and eschewed Evil,</hi> Job 1. 11. To do that
we do out of love to him; obeying his
Laws as our Rule, and depending upon
his Rewards as our Happiness. And as
to Men, let us be faithful, and walk holily
in our Places, Callings, and Relations,
being just and kind unto all, but having
an exceeding dear love for our fellow-Saints
and everlasting Companions. This
is more pleasing to God than the costliest
Sacrifices, than all our Flocks and Herds,
or any outward thing that we do for him.
I take notice of those words of God to
<hi>Solomon,</hi> when he was building him a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Temple, 1 Kings 6. 11, 12. <hi>And
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64994:27"/>
the Word of the Lord came to</hi> Solomon, <hi>say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Concerning this House which thou art
building, if thou wilt walk in my Statutes,
and execute my Iudgments, and keep all my
Commandments to walk in them; then will
I perform my Word to thee, which I spake to</hi>
David <hi>thy Father.</hi> God hath more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s faithful Obedience, than
to that glorious Building. So far do Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
exceed Ceremonials in Religion.</p>
                  <p>3. That you prefer a broken-hearted
thankful sense of our Redeemer's Love,
before legal and conceited Righteousness
of our own. Christ's love to Sinners, is
that which the Pharisees mainly stumbled
at. An external shew and fair pretence
of a good Life, which had no bottom of
Regeneration, was the superficial Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of the Pharisees. <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who
had been of that Sect, wondred when that
was pressed upon him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 4, 5. an
outward Conformity, which was more in
Shew than in Substance, in Form and
Fashion than in Power, was their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
abstaining from gross Sins, as Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Adultery, but not purifying the
Heart from Lusts. Murder they made
Conscience of, but not of Envy, Malice,
and Hatred: Theft, but not Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64994:28"/>
and close Extortion; Adultery, but
not Wantonness, or looking upon a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to lust after her, as you may see at
large <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. Thus Christ presseth us
to exceed the Pharisees, who turned all
Obedience into an empty Formality;
wherein they puffed up themselves as
meer Men, and so had never been at the
Market of Free Grace; all their Wares
were their own, and their Righteousness
of their own spinning, and therein stood
upon their own Bottom, without seeking
the reconciling and renewing Grace of
the Redeemer. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. The proud
<hi>Pharisee</hi> pleadeth his own Merits rather
than God's Grace, but the <hi>Publican</hi> pleaded
Mercy. 'Twas long e're <hi>Paul</hi> was brought
to count all but Dung and Dross for the
Excellency of the Knowledg of Christ,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9. But on the other side, a
Christian, though he maketh progress in
Holiness, yet from first to last, cherisheth
a broken-hearted sense of his own Wants,
and a thankful remembrance of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's
Love, who is all in all with him,
both for Justification and Sanctification.
Before Pardon, the Sinner is weakned and
humbled with a sense of his lost Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and then there is a constant watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64994:28"/>
with Repentance and brokenness
of Heart, which followeth Pardon; <hi>loving
much, because much is forgiven,</hi> Luke 7.
47. And loathing himself in his own
sight, because of his vileness and sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
after God is reconciled to him, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
16. 63. This is the frame of Heart which
suiteth with the Gospel-state.</p>
                  <p>III. I come to the third Thing, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of <hi>Mercy.</hi> I shall not speak of it at
large, but only with respect to this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>1. 'Tis <hi>better than Sacrifice.</hi> To sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
is to serve God; but to shew Mercy,
is to be like God. Luke 6. 36. Be <hi>ye
therefore merciful, as your Heavenly Father
is merciful.</hi> Now Conformity to God is
more noble, than Subjection to God; it
hath more of Perfection and Blessedness
in it especially, than a particular external
mode and way of subjection to God.</p>
                  <p>2. As 'tis preferred before Sacrifice, so
'tis preferred before the external Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sabbath. The Sabbath is the
great Institution conducing to the enlive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of other Duties; Mercy, not only
to the Souls of Men as here, or Bodies of
Men, but Mercy to the Bodies of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64994:29"/>
to help a Beast out of a Pit, is a Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
work, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>3. 'Tis more than Gospel-Externals of
Worship. The Apostle had spoken of
being <hi>not hearers of the Word only, but do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
also,</hi> Jam. 1. 25. Then saith, <hi>Vers.</hi> 27.
<hi>Pure Religion, and undefiled before God, is
this, To visit the Fatherless and Widows
in their Affliction, and keep himself unspotted
from the World.</hi> Is this Religion, to come
to Church to hear the strictest Preachers?
Doth the Apostle reckon this another part
of Religion? No, but to <hi>visit the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and Widows.</hi> They who are truly
Religious, have such a deep sense of God's
Mercy to them, that they are changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Divine Nature, that they cannot
but pity the miserable and afflicted. Now
the Ordinances of the Gospel are rational,
not so carnal and servile as the Ordinances
under the Law.</p>
                  <p>4. 'Tis more excellent than all the Gifts
of the Gospel. The Gifts of the Gospel
were glorious Things, Gifts of Tongues,
Gifts of Healing, Gifts of Knowledg and
Utterance; 1 Cor. 12. 31. <hi>Covet earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the best Gifts; and yet I shew you a more
excellent way.</hi> What is that? Love, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Mercy. Though Abilities are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64994:29"/>
Things, to be able to edify and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
others, yet no way to be compared
with the Grace of Charity, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
all our Duties to our Brethren out
of love to God.</p>
                  <p>5. I cannot say 'tis above the Graces of
the Gospel, Faith, and Love to God; yet
this I can say, that those Graces are not
real, unless accompanied with Charity:
1 John 4. 20. <hi>If a Man say he loveth God,
and hateth his Brother, he is a liar: for if a
Man hateth his Brother whom he hath seen,
how can he love God whom he hath not seen?</hi>
He speaketh there of Love to Christ, <hi>vers.</hi>
19. <hi>We love him, because he loved us first.</hi>
There may be a great deal of Hypocrisy
in professing and pretending Love to
Christ; and so he doth certainly, who
doth malign and persecute Christians, or
not shew Mercy to them in their Distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
We daily converse with Men, meet with
Objects of Charity, whom we should pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but if we do not this, which is the
more easy, we will not do that which is
more difficult.</p>
                  <p>6. 'Tis the Qualification of finding
Mercy; Mat. 5. 7. <hi>`Blessed are the Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
for they shall obtain Mercy.</hi> Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to other Mens Bodies and Souls, gives
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64994:30"/>
this hope and confidence of finding Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
with the Lord, and that is all our
Hope.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It will be inquired into at the Day of
Judgment,</hi> Mat. 25. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41.
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me Meat:
I was thirsty, and ye gave me Drink: I was
a Stranger, and ye took me in: Naked, and
ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited
me: I was in Prison, and ye came unto me.
Then shall the Righteous answer him, saying,
Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed
thee? or thirsty, and gave thee Drink? When
saw we thee a Stranger, and took thee in?
or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw
we thee sick, or in Prison, and came unto
thee? And the King shall answer, and say
unto them, Verily I say unto you, in as much
as ye have done it unto one of the least of
these my Brethren, ye have done it unto me.
Then shall he say also unto them on the left
hand, Depart from me ye cursed, into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Fire, prepared for the Devil and his
Angels.</p>
                  <p>Oh then let us make Conscience of
this Duty more than ever we have done.</p>

Flesh.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>I. They worship God in the Spirit.
This Clause may be interpreted,</p>
                  <p>(1.) In opposition to the Legal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances:
So 'tis taken, <hi>Iohn 4. 23, 24. But
the hour cometh, and now is, when the true
Worshippers shall worship the Father in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and in Truth: For the Father seeketh
such to worship him. God is a Spirit, and
they that worship him, must worship him in
Spirit, and Truth.</hi> The Jewish Worship
is in a sense called Carnal; the Christian,
Spiritual: Heb. 7. 16. <hi>A Carnal Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:64994:32"/>
Heb. 9. 10. <hi>Carnal Ordinances im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
on them till the Time of Reformation.</hi>
And <hi>Shadows,</hi> Heb. 10. 1. Now the Lord
would have a Spiritual Worship, and the
Truth of what was in these Shadows,
these external Forms, he allowed (insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
in the Infancy of the Church); so
that <hi>they worship God in the Spirit,</hi> is, they
have embraced the true Worship of the
Gospel, and serve God, not by the Carnal
Rites of the Law, but by the pure ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Worship of the Gospel. This is part
of the sense.</p>
                  <p>(2.) It implieth worshipping God with
the inward and spiritual Affections of a
renewed Heart: Heb. 12. 28. <hi>Wherefore,
we receiving a Kingdom which cannot be
moved, Let us have Grace, whereby we may
serve God acceptably with Reverence and
Godly Fear.</hi> Worship flowing from
Grace, engaging the Heart in God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
is that which God prizeth; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Christian should not rest in an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Form: <hi>God is my Witness, whom I
serve with my Spirit,</hi> Rom. 1. 9.</p>
                  <p>(3.) It doth also imply the Assistance,
and continual Influence of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
<hi>Ephes. 6. 18. Praying always with all
Prayer, and supplication in the Spirit; and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64994:32"/>
watching thereunto with all perseverance, and
supplication for all Saints.</hi> And <hi>Iude,</hi> v.
20. <hi>Praying in the Holy Ghost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctrine is this:</p>
                  <p>That a True Christian is known by his
Worship; or is one that doth wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God in the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Here I shall shew you,
<list>
                        <item>1. What is Worship.</item>
                        <item>2. What a true Christian (1.) doth
worship; (2.) Why in the Spirit.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. What is Worship. 'T is either Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
or External. The Internal consisteth
in the Love and Reverence we owe to
God. The External in those Offices and
Duties by which our Honour and Respect
to God is signified and expressed.</p>
                  <p>1. Internal. The Soul and Life of our
Worship lieth in Faith, and Reverence,
and delight in God above all other things.
Psal. 2. 11. <hi>Serve the Lord with Fear, and
rejoice with Trembling.</hi> Such a delight as
will become the greatness and goodness of
God. Worship hath its Rise and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
in the Heart of the Worshipper;
there it must begin: In our high thoughts
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64994:33"/>
and esteem of God, especially two things,
<hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Trust.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1.) <hi>Love;</hi> Deut. 6. 5. <hi>Thou shalt love
the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, with
all thy Soul, and with all thy Might.</hi> We
worship God, when we give him such a
Love as is Superlative and Transcenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
far above the Love that we give to
any other thing, that so our respect to
other things may s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oop, and give way to
our respect to God.</p>
                  <p>(2.) The other Affection whereby we
express our esteem of God, is Trust, which
is the other Foundation of Worship:
Psal. 62. 8. <hi>Trust in the Lord at all Times,
pour out your Hearts before him.</hi> Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
adhesion to God, and an intire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
upon him; if either fail, or be
intermitted, our Worship faileth. If <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;</hi>
Job 27. 10. <hi>Will he delight himself
in the Almighty? Will he always call upon
God?</hi> Isa. 43. 22. <hi>But thou hast not called
upon me, O</hi> Jacob; <hi>but thou hast been weary
of me, O</hi> Israel. They that love God, and
delight in him, cannot be long out of his
company. They take all Opportunities
and Occasions of being with God. So
<hi>Dependance</hi> and <hi>Trust;</hi> Heb. 3. 12. <hi>Take</hi>
Brethren, <hi>lest there be in any of you an
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64994:33"/>
evil Heart of unbelief, in departing from
the Living God.</hi> James 1. 6, 7. <hi>Let him
ask in Faith, nothing wavering: for he
that wavereth, is like a Wave of the Sea,
driven with the Wind, and tossed. For let
not that Man think that he shall receive any
thing of the Lord.</hi> Dependance begets
Observance; They that distrust God's
Promises, will not long keep his Precepts:
If we look for all from him, we will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
come to him, and take all out of his
hands: Be careful that we do not offend
him, and displease him.</p>
                  <p>2. External. In those Offices and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
by which our Honour and Respect to
God is signified and expressed: As by
Invocation, Thanksgiving, Praises, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
God will be owned both in Heart
and Life. In all these prescribed Duties
by which our Affections towards him are
acted. If God did not call for outward
Worship, why did he appoint the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of Preaching, Praying, singing
Psalms, Baptism, and the Lord's Supper?
God that made the whole Man, Body,
and Soul, must be worshipped of the
whole Man: Therefore, besides the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Affections, there must be External
Actions. In short, we are said to worship
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64994:34"/>
God, either with respect to the Duties
which are more directly to be performed
to God, or in our whole Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>1. With respect to the Duties which
imply our solemn Converse with God, and
are more directly to be performed towards
him; such as the Word, Prayer, Praise,
Thanksgiving, and Sacraments: Surely
these must be attended upon, because they
are special Acts of Love to God, and Trust
in him: And these Duties are the ways
wherein God hath promised to meet with
his People, and appointed us to expect
his Grace: <hi>Exod. 20. 24. In all places
where I record my Name, I will come unto
thee, and bless thee.</hi> And, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 24.
'Tis a Rule of Commerce between us and
God; <hi>With what measure ye mete, it shall
be measured to you; and unto you that hear,
shall more be given.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. In our whole Conversation: <hi>Luke</hi>
1. 74, 75. <hi>That we should serve him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Fear, in Holiness and Righteousness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him all the days of our lives.</hi> A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian's
Life is a constant Hymn to God, or
a continued Act of Worship: ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having
himself as in the sight of God, and
directing all things as to his Glory: He
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64994:34"/>
turneth Second-Table Duties into First.
James 1. 27. <hi>Pure Religion, and undefiled
before God and the Father, is this, To visit
the Fatherless and Widows in their Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to keep himself unspotted from the
World.</hi> Heb. 13. 16. <hi>To do good, and to
communicate, forget not; for with such Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
God is well pleased.</hi> Ephes. 5. 21,
22. <hi>Submitting your selves one to another
in the fear of God.</hi> Now a true Christian
maketh Conscience of all this, as of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Worship, so External. As of Solemn
and Sacred Acts, so of a constant Awful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; The Reasons.</p>
                  <p>1<hi>st,</hi> Why a true Christian doth wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God.</p>
                  <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> Why in the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>1<hi>st,</hi> For the Worship it self.</p>
                  <p>1. Because they have a deep sense of
his Being and Excellency impressed upon
their Hearts.</p>
                  <p>(1.) His Being: These two Notions
live and die together: That God is, and
that he ought to be worshipped and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. The one immediately
floweth from the other: The first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
is, <hi>Thou shalt have no other Gods
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64994:35"/>
before me.</hi> The second, <hi>Thou shalt not

                     </gap> they had no
God. The <hi>Psalmist</hi> proveth At<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ism by
that <hi>Psal. 14. 1. The Fool hath said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>

Heart, There is no God.</hi> And, <hi>vers. 4. They
call not upon God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(2.) His Excellency: They have a cleare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
sight of God than others have, and are
more acquainted with him than other<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
are, and therefore are more prone to
worship. When God had proclaimed his
Name, and manifested himself to <hi>Moses,</hi>
Exod. 34. 8. <hi>He made haste, and bowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the Earth, and worshipped:</hi> None
so ready and forward. Psal. 9. 10. <hi>They
that know thy Name, will put their trust in
thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Because they have a Principle within
them, which inclineth them to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Their Hearts are carried to him, as light
Bodies are carried upward. There is
such a Grace as <hi>Godliness,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 6. and
distinct in the Notion from Righteousness
and Holiness. 1 Tim. 6. 11. <hi>Follow after
Righteousness, Godliness.</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 11.
<hi>What manner of Persons ought we to be in
all Holy Conversation and Godliness?</hi> What
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64994:35"/>
is the Notion then of it? 'Tis <hi>Tendentia
mentis in Deum.</hi> An Impression left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Hearts, which causeth a bent
and tendency towards God, as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of their Mercies, the Joy of their
Souls, and the Center of their Rest. There
is such an Inclination, in some stronger,
in others more remiss; but in all that are
made Partakers of a Divine Nature, in
some good Degree, so as ordinarily to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
over the Inclinations of the Flesh: As
Holiness noteth purity of Life, so Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
an Inclination to God.</p>
                  <p>3. Because of their Relations to God
which they own: God pleadeth his Right,
Mal. 1. 6. <hi>If I be a Father, Where is mine
Honour? If I be a Master, Where is my
Fear?</hi> A Father must have Honour, and
a Master must have Fear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And God, who
is the common <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of all, must have both: A Worship
and Honour in which, Reverence and
Fear, is mixed with Love and Joy. Or
as the owning of a King, implyeth submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to his Government; so the owning
of a God, Adoration, and Worship.</p>
                  <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> Why in the Spirit?</p>
                  <p>1. Because Worship without the Spirit,
is like a Body without the Soul; 'tis but
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64994:36"/>
the Carcase of a Duty: The Heart must
be the principal and chief Agent in this
Business; Mat. 15. 8. <hi>This People draweth
nigh to me with their Mouths, and honoureth
me with their Lips, but their Hearts are far
from me.</hi> There is no Love to God, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
an habitual aversion from him.</p>
                  <p>2. External Worship is but a Means to
the Internal; as Prayer, Hearing, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Receiving, tend to promote Love,
Trust, Heavenly-mindedness, Self-denial,
Mortification, purity of Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation:
Now as the Means are only
valuable with respect to their End, so are
these Duties of Hearing, Reading, Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Diligence in the use of Means is
good, but those Acts that are conversant
about the End are better; such as the
Love of God, and Delight and Trust in
God; for, <hi>Finis est nobilior mediis:</hi> Nay,
amongst the Internal Acts, as they are
Means to one another, so the nearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
they have to the last End, the more
noble they are: As Faith is more noble than
bare Knowledg, because Knowledg tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to Faith; <hi>Psalm.</hi> 5. 10. Love, than
Faith; because Faith tendeth to Love:
<hi>Gal. 5. 6. 1 Cor.</hi> 13. 13. Faith causeth
Love, and serveth as the Bellows to in-kindle
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64994:36"/>
this Holy Fire; and in Love, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
maketh way for Delight, as its noblest
Act. And accordingly must all things be
valued, as they suit the great End, which
is the injoying of God.</p>
                  <p>3. A Man doth not partake of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Blessing,
till he doth serve God in
the Spirit; that is, till he be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
of the Regenerating Grace, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Influence of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Of his Regenerating Grace, <hi>Rom.
7. 6. That we should serve in newness of
the Spirit, and not in oldness of the Letter.</hi>
New Life is the principal of Evangelical
Obedience; and when we are renewed
by the Holy Ghost, we walk in newness
of Conversation. The Gospel is a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8. It not only
requireth Duty, but giveth Power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it. The Letter of the Law requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
but giveth no Principle or Inclination
to do it; that is, from Regenerating
Grace, or the Law written upon our
Hearts. John 3. 6. <hi>That which is born of
Spirit, is Spirit;</hi> that is, suited, inclined,
disposed, fitted for a Spiritual Life.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Actual Influence: He still work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in us what is pleasing in God's sight.
Helpeth to mortify Corruption; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64994:37"/>
13. <hi>If ye through the Spirit, do mortify the
Deeds of the Body, ye shall live:</hi> To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Holiness, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 21. that so we may
serve God in all purity of Life. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
get, nor keep, nor act, nor increase
Grace of our selves, if forsaken by the
Spirit of Grace: The foulest Sins would
become our Pleasure, and the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
Duties our Burden: If he
withdraw his quickning Influences, you
can do nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. It reproveth those that either
do not worship God, or by halves, or not
worship him in the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>1. It disproveth their Confidence that
do not worship God: There are an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
sort of Men, that neither call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him in publick, or in private, in the
Family, or in the Closet, but wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the God that made them, and at
whose expence they are maintained and
kept.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Let me reason with you as Men:
Wherefore had you reasonable Souls, but
to praise, and honour, and glorify your
Creator and Preserver? If you believe
there is a God, why do you not call upon
him? The neglect of his Worship, argueth
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64994:37"/>
a doubting of his Being: If there be such
a supream Lord, to whom you must one
day give an account; how dare you live
without him in the World? All the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
glorify him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 145. 10. they pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively;
but you have a Heart, and a
Tongue to glorify him actually: Man is
the Mouth of the Creation, to return to
God the praise of all that Wisdom, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and Power, which is seen in the
things that are made. Now you should
make one among the Worshippers of
God.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Let me reason with you as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
Are you a Christian, and have such
Advantages to know more of God, and
will you be dumb, and tongue-tied in his
Praise? Have you the discovery of the
Wonders of his Love, in your Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Christ, and do you see no cause
to own and acknowledg him? Have you
no Necessities to bring to the Throne of
Grace? In Christianity, you know his
particular Providence, and Redemption
by Christ; and should you eat, and drink,
and trade, and sleep, and never think of
God? Have you no Pardon to sue out, no
Grace that you stand in need of; that you
should live like a brute Beat? go on in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64994:38"/>
the circle of Trade, Business, Comforts,
and never think of God! You profess
you know him, but in your Works you
deny him; and sin doubly, both against
the Light of Reason and Christianity. All
that are not avowed Ath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ists, must have

                  <p>2. It cutteth off their Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>idence, that
worship him by halves: They are of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sorts.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Some worship him in publick, but
never in private and secret; though Christ
hath given us direction to enter into our
Closets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 6. And surely every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
should make Conscience of secret
Duties. There are many Disputes about
praying in Families; though those that
take their daily Bread should seek God
together: but there can be no dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
praying in Secret; for the Precept
that requireth Prayer, first falleth upon
single Persons, before it falleth upon Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
and Churches, 1 <hi>Thess. 5. 17. Pray
without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>easing.</hi> This cannot concern Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
and Churches, they are done at sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
times, when they can conveniently
meet; but every Man in secret is to be
often with God. Christ was often alone,
<hi>Mark 1. 35. He went <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ut into a solitary
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64994:38"/>
place, and there prayed.</hi> Surely Christ had
not such need to pray as we have, nor
such need of retirement, his Love to God
being always <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ervent, and so in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of distraction: God poured out the
Spirit, that we might go apart, and mourn
over Soul-Distempers, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10, 11,
12, 13, 14. Now God's precious Gifts
are not given in vain. So, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 2.
Cornelius <hi>prayed to God alway.</hi> Therefore
certainly secret Prayer is a necessary Duty
of God's Worship to be observed by all
that acknowledg God to be God, and the
World to be ruled by his Providence, or
themselves to have any need of his Grace
and Pardon, or hope for any thing from
him in the World to come: Therefore if
you have any sense of Religion, or think
you have any need of particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
with God, you should make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of secret Prayer.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Others that make Conscience of
External Worship, Prayer, Hearing,
Reading, Singing of Psalms; but not of
Internal Worship, Faith, Love, and Hope:
The External Forms were appointed for
the acting or increasing of Internal Grace;
and so they superficially are conversant
about the Means, and never mind the End;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64994:39"/>
External Worship is sensible, and easily
done; but Internal Worship is difficult:
External Worship may procure us esteem
with Men; but Internal, Acceptance with
God: External Worship satisfieth blind
Conscience, but doth not better the
Heart: External Worship may puff us up
with a vain Confidence; but Internal
Worship maketh us lament Spiritual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects:
We have not that purity of Heart,
that deep sense of the World to come;
that absolute dependance upon God,
which may quiet our Souls in all Exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
Surely they are better Christians
that have the Effect of the Ordinances,
than they that have only the Formality of
them. The External Duty may procure us
toil and wearisomness to the Flesh, but
the Internal Worship bringeth us Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and Peace: The more Faith in Christ,
and Love to God, and lively Hope of
Eternal Life, the more is the Soul comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Therefore if you will always lick the
Glass, and never taste the Hony; go on in
a Tract of Duties, but you will have no
comfort in them. In short; They that
go on in External Duties, may be said in
some sense to serve God, but they do not
seek after him: In pretence they make
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64994:39"/>
God the <hi>Object</hi> of their Worship, for
they do not worship an Idol; but
they do not make him the <hi>End</hi> of
their Worship: A Man maketh God
the End of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Worship, when he
will not go away from God, without
God; when he looketh to this, that his
delight in God be quickned, his depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon God strengthned, his hatred
of Sin encreased, and by every Address
to God, is made more like God.</p>
                  <p>(3.) It reproveth, and disproveth those
that put on a garb of Devotion, when
ministring before the Lord, but are slight
and vain in their ordinary Conversation:
A Man should be in some measure such
out of Duty, as he giveth out himself to
be in Duty; For his whole Life should
be, as it were, a continued Act of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
Prov. 23. 17. <hi>Let not thy Heart
envy Sinners, but be thou in the Fear of the
Lord all the day long.</hi> We should still
live in a dependance upon God, and in
subjection to him: Psal. 16. 8. <hi>I have set
the Lord always before me: He is at my
right hand, I shall not be moved.</hi> In Point
of Reverence, and in point of Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
because we are in danger to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry,
both by the Delights of Sense, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64994:40"/>
the Terrors of Sense: If a reverence of,
and a dependance on the great God, do
still possess our Hearts, we shall carry our
selves more soberly as to the Comforts of
the World, and not be easily discouraged
and daunted with the Fears of the World:
This is our Preservative, and maketh us
true and faithful to our great End.</p>
                  <p>3. Those that do not serve God in the
Spirit. You should worship God so, as it
may look like Worship and Service per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to God, and due to God. 'Tis
Spiritual Worship God requireth, and is
ever pleased with all: He seeketh such to
worship him, as worship him in Spirit,
and in Truth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 23. And this is
most agreeable to his Nature, <hi>Iohn 4. 24.
God is a Spirit, and they that worship him,
must worship him in Spirit and in Truth.</hi>
When Hearts wander, when Affections do
not answer Expressions, Is this like Service
and Worship done to an All-seeing, and
All-knowing Spirit? Is there any stamp of
God upon the Duty, of his Majesty,
Goodness, and great Power?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2. For the Comfort of good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:
Here is their Carriage towards
God briefly set down; <hi>They worship God
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64994:40"/>
in the Spirit.</hi> A Christian is described by
his proper Act, <hi>Worship;</hi> and by the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Object thereof, <hi>God;</hi> and by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
part and seat thereof, <hi>In the Spirit.</hi>
Do you worship him with Reverence,
and with Delight and Affection; with a
Trust, Hope, and Confidence?</p>
                  <p>1. With Reverence. Considering God's
Majesty, and our own Vileness: The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of God; Mal. 1. 13. <hi>For I am a
great King, saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi> Slight
Worship, argueth lessening thoughts of
God. Do you know to whom you speak!
'Tis a contempt of God, if you think
any thing will serve the turn, you have
mean thoughts of him, and do not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him as you ought to do: So our vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>Gen. 18. 27. Who am I, that am but
Dust and Ashes, that I should speak unto
God?</hi> Dust, as to the business of his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal,
and Ashes by the desert of Sin:
In our nearer Approaches to God, thus
should we think of our selves.</p>
                  <p>2. With Delight and Affection, as our
reconciled Father in Christ. So, he is to
us, as the Well-spring of all Grace and
Goodness: The great Work of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
is to bring us to God, as a Father,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. God as a Judg, by the Spirit
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64994:41"/>
of Bondage, driveth us to Christ: But
Christ, by the Spirit of Adoption, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us back again to God as a Father.
This is the Evangelical way of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
that in a Child-like manner we may
come to God.</p>
                  <p>3. With Trust, Hope, and Confidence.
He knoweth all our Wants, can relieve
all our Necessities: Psal. 57. 2. <hi>I will cry
unto God most high, who performeth all things
for me.</hi> Worship would be a cold For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality,
if we had to do with one that
knew us not, or had not Sufficiency and
Power to help us: But God is Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and All-sufficient, and hath promised
to hear and help us in our straits: He
knoweth our Necessities, when we know
them not.</p>
                  <p>II. We come now to the second Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter;
<hi>And rejoice in Christ Iesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thence observe;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> That the great Work of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
is a rejoicing in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
or a thankful sense of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's
Mercy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:64994:41"/>In opening this Point, I shall use
this method.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1<hi>st,</hi> Shew you, What is this rejoicing
in Christ.</item>
                     <item>2<hi>dly,</hi> I shall prove, That Christ is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of true Rejoicing, in his Person,
Offices, Benefits.</item>
                     <item>3<hi>dly,</hi> That Christians are not sound
and sincere in their Profession, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
they do keep up this Rejoicing
in Christ.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1<hi>st,</hi> What is this Rejoicing? <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>:
The Original word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth
such a degree of Joy, as amounts
to glorification or boasting; or such an
exultation of Mind, as breaketh out into
some sensible expression of it. There are
in it three things.</p>
                  <p>(1.) An apprehension of the Good
and Benefit which we have by Christ;
For otherwise how can we rejoice and
glory in Him? 1 Cor. 1. 30, 31. <hi>But of
him, ye are in Christ Iesus, who of God is
made to us, Wisdom, and Righteousness,
and Sanctification, and Redemption; That
according as it is written, He that glorieth,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64994:42"/>
let him glory in the Lord;</hi> Christ is All.
That our whole Rejoicing may be in him,
who hath enlightned us with the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the Gospel, and shewed us the
way of Salvation, and is the Author of
our Justification and Sanctification, and
of our deliverance from all Calamities, and
from Death it self. These Benefits are the
cause of our rejoicing; namely, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the Gospel, sealed by his Death,
and the Graces conveyed to us by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
We rejoice and glory in him, as the
only and all-sufficient Saviour. They
that gloried in Circumcision, gloried in
their entrance into the Legal Covenant;
They became Debtors to the Law, but
Christ hath rati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ied it in the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
by his Blood; therefore here is more
abundant cause of rejoicing.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Due Affections of Contentment,
Joy, Love, Exultation of Heart, that
followeth thereupon. A blessing our
selves in our Portion, that this great Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
is fallen to our share, offered to us
at least, if not possessed by us: The very
Knowledg of Christianity, breedeth Joy,
Acts 8. 8. <hi>And there was great joy in that
City.</hi> That is, upon the tendency of the
Gospel, much more when we believe in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64994:42"/>
Christ, and embrace his Religion, and
resolve to become his Disciples. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his Word gladly, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. His
Doctrine must be welcomed with the
Heart, with all Love and Thankfulness:
'Tis said of the Jaylor, <hi>Acts 16. 34. That
he rejoiced, believing in God, and all his
House.</hi> He was but newly recovered out
of the Suburbs of Hell, ready to kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
but just before; so that a Man would
think, 'twere easier to fetch Water out of
a Flint, or a spark of Fire out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Sea, than to expect or find
Joy in such an Heart; yea, though still
in danger of Life, for treating those as
Guests, whom he should have kept as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners;
yet he rejoiced, when acquainted
with Salvation by Christ: More especially
should we rejoice, when the Comfort is
sealed up to our Consciences: <hi>Rom. 5. 11.
Not only so, but we also joy in God, through
our Lord Iesus Christ, by whom we have now
received the Atonement.</hi> The Eunuch,
when he was baptized, <hi>He went on his way
rejoicing,</hi> Acts 8. 39.</p>
                  <p>(3.) An expression of it, by an open
Profession of Christ's Name, both in
Word and Deed, what-ever it costs us:
They are said to rejoice in Christ Jesus,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64994:43"/>
who in those Times could profess his
Name, though with hazard and self-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
As the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> who received
the Word with much Affliction, and much
Assurance, and Joy in the Holy Ghost,
1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 6. And 'tis expressed by the
Parable of the Man that found the true
Treasure, and for joy thereof, sold all
that he had to buy the Field, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.
44. They are willing to lose all other
Contentments and Satisfactions for this,
Christ is enough. They needed this Joy to
encourage them against the Tryals which
they then underwent for Christ's sake, and
the Gospel's sake.</p>
                  <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> That Christ is matter of true
Rejoicing; for they are Fools that rejoice
in Bawbles and Trifles. A Christian's Joy
may be owned and justified. When
Christ's Birth was celebrated by Angels,
'tis said, <hi>Luke 2. 10. Behold, I bring you
glad tydings of great Ioy.</hi> Here is Joy,
and great Joy in Salvation by Christ:
And <hi>Mary,</hi> Luk 1. 46, 47. <hi>My Soul doth
magnify the Lord, and my Spirit doth rejoice
in God my Saviour.</hi> Surely, there is no
cause of Joy wanting in God, and in
God coming as a Saviour. In short, In
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64994:43"/>
Christianity, all is fitted to fill our Hearts
with Delight and Joy.</p>
                  <p>1. The wonderful Mysteries of our
Redemption by Christ. Thereby,</p>
                  <p>(1.) A way is found out for our Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
with God, and how that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Controversy may be taken up, and
Heaven and Earth may kiss each other,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19. Surely this is glad Tidings of
great Joy, to self-condemned Sinners,
who stood always in fear of the Wrath of
God, and the Flames of Hell: What
Joy is it to a condemned Man, that is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
every day to be taken away to Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to hear that his Peace is made, that
Pardon may be had, if he will seek it, and
sue it out?</p>
                  <p>(2.) A distinct Relation of a defeat of
the great Enemies of our Salvation,
Death, Hell, the Devil, and the World:
He hath not only made our Peace with
the Father, by the Blood of his Cross,
but vanquished our Spiritual Enemies,
and triumphed over them, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14, 15.
Long enough might we have lain in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
before the utmost Farthing had been
paid, or done any thing to procure our
deliverance, if our compassionate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
had not taken the Work in hand:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64994:44"/>
had he turned us to any Creature, we had
been helpless. 'Twas he purchased Grace
to overcome the Devil, the World, and
the Flesh; that quickned you when you
were dead in Sin; that put Satan out of
Office, and delivered us from the present
evil World, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. And is not this
matter of rejoicing to us?</p>
                  <p>(3.) That hereby he hath not only abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
Death, but brought Life, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
to Life, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. By en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into that other World, after his
Sufferings, He hath given us a visible
Demonstration of the Reality of the
World to come, and in his Gospel disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
a Blessedness to us, which satiateth
the Heart of Man, and salveth the great
Sore of the whole Creation: If God had
made nothing richer than the World, the
Heart of Man would have been as <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
in a little Pool.</p>
                  <p>2. In the Promises of Christ, there is
matter of Joy. In the general, God is
your God, and that's more than to have
all the World to be yours; compare
Gen. 17. 7. <hi>I will establish my Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
me and thee, and thy Seed after thee
in their Generations, for an everlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
to be a God unto thee, and thy
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64994:44"/>
Seed after thee.</hi> With <hi>Psal. 144. 15. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
is that People whose God is the Lord.</hi> We
have an Eternal and Allsufficient God to
live upon, and from whom to derive our
Joy and Comfort. A God infinite in
Power, Wisdom, and Goodness, to be
our Portion. And where is Matter of
Joy and Comfort, if not in God? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the difference between Carnal Men
and the Children of God; The World is
their Portion, and God is ours; and who
is better provided for? More especially
we are told, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 8. That Godliness
hath the Promises of this Life, and that
which is to come.</hi> Heaven and Earth are
laid at the Feet of Godliness; what would
you more<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Surely we have full Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
offered to us in the Promises of the
Gospel; He can want nothing to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> hath an Interest in them.
To instance in the lowest Blessings, those
which concern this Life: God is our God,
that can cure all Diseases, overcome all
Enemies, supply all Wants, deliver in all
Dangers, and will do it so far as is for our
good; and desires of any thing beyond
this, are not to be satisfied, but mortified,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 84. 11. But then for the more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Promises of the New Covenant,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64994:45"/>
which concern another World, such as the
pardoning of our Sins, the healing our
Natures, and the glorifying of our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
2 Pet. 1. 4. <hi>Whereby are given unto
us exceeding great and precious Promises,
that by these you might be partakers of the
Divine Nature, having escaped the corruption
that is in the World through lust.</hi> The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of all our Sins, which are the great
trouble and burden of the Creatures.
Who will rejoice like the pardoned Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
who is discharged of his Debt,
eased of his Burthen, and hath his Filth
covered? Psal. 32. 1. <hi>Blessed is the Man
whose Transgression is forgiven, whose Sin i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
covered.</hi> O the blessedness of the Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
He is like one fetched back from Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Then, the taking away of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Heart, and the giving of an Holy and
Heavenly Heart. Oh what Matter of
Joy is this! to have all things necessary
to Life and Godliness: What's the trouble
of a gracious Heart, but the Relicts of
Corruption? <hi>Rom. 7. 24. Paul</hi> groaneth
sorely, but yet blesseth God for his Hopes
by Christ; <hi>Vers.</hi> 25. Renewing Grace is
dearly bought, and plentifully bestowed,
<hi>Titus</hi> 3. 5, 6. and graciously offered to
those that will seek after it. Prov. 1. 23.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64994:45"/>
                     <hi>Turn you at my Reproof; Behold, I will
pour out my Spirit unto you.</hi> And this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to be fulfilled by a Divine Power;
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. Oh what a Comfort is the
Redeemer's Grace, to a Soul that hath
been long exercised in subduing Sin!
'Tis true, it groans while 'tis a doing,
yet the very groans of the Sick, shew that
Life and Health is sweet: Healing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing
Grace maketh other Things sweet:
as your whole Duty to God; It maketh
it become your Delight. But the great
Promise is Eternal Life: 1 John 2. 25. <hi>And
this is the Promise that he hath promised us,
even Eternal Life.</hi> That's a Matter of Joy
indeed: What! to live for ever with
God! the fore-thought of it reviveth us;
the fore-taste of it is a kind of Heaven
upon Earth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. The certain hope
of it will swallow up all Grief and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2, 3. So that there is no
question, but that in the Promises of
Christ, there is Matter of great Joy.</p>
                  <p>3. The Enjoiments of Christianity are
very pleasing: I add this to shew you,
that it is not all in expectation, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
not only what we shall be, but what
we are. For the present;</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:64994:46"/>(1.) We have peace of Conscience, <hi>Rom.
5. 1. Mat. 11. 29. Phil.</hi> 4. 7. Rest for
our Souls is anxiously sought after in
other things, but only found in Christ's
Religion, and living according to the
Precepts and Institutions thereof. As
<hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove found not a place whereon
to rest the sole of her Foot; so we flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
up and down, but never have any firm
peace of Heart and Conscience, till we
submit to Christ, and take his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel.</p>
                  <p>(2.) <hi>A sence of the Love of God;</hi> Rom.
5. 5. Because the Love of God is shed abroad
in our Hearts by the Holy Spirit given unto
us. <hi>And,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 3. If so be ye have
tasted that the Lord is gracious.</p>
                  <p>(3.) <hi>God's Presence with us, and our
Communion with him.</hi> 1 Iohn 1. 3, 4.
And truly our Fellowship is with the Father,
and with his Son Iesus Christ, that your Ioy
may be full. <hi>And,</hi> Iohn 8. 29.</p>
                  <p>(4.) Access to God, with assurance of
Welcome and Audience. John 16. 24.
<hi>Whatsoever ye ask in my Name, ye shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that your Ioy may be full.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(5.) The Fore-tastes of the Life to
come; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. So
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64994:46"/>
that all is to stir up this Delight and Joy
in the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>4. The Precepts of Christ shew, that
we have Matter of Rejoicing in him.
What are the great Duties required? To
love God! Now what pain is it to delight
in the Lord as our All-sufficient Portion?
To be mindful of him, and meditate of
his Excellencies and Benefits: Psal. 104.
34. <hi>My Meditation of him shall be sweet,
I will be glad in the Lord.</hi> Is it any
toilsome thing to come in a childish man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and unbosome our selves to him, and
beg the renewed Testimonies of his Love
to us, especially when set awork by the
Holy Ghost? <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. To believe in
Christ, 'tis difficult; but pleasant to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the Lord Jesus as the suitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for the lapsed Estate of Mankind,
both as to his Work with God and us:
<hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 1. He came to destroy Sin and
Misery! When-ever we reflect upon
Christ, what do we find but ample grounds
of Joy? John 14. 1. <hi>Let not your Hearts
be troubled; ye believe in God, believe also
in me.</hi> That is, to get off our trouble,
consider, we have an Alsufficient God,
and an Alsufficient Mediator. <hi>Rom. 15.
13. Now the God of Hope fill you with all
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64994:47"/>
Ioy and Peace in believing, that ye may
abound in Hope, through the Power of the
Holy Ghost.</hi> Repentance requireth sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for Sin, only as it tendeth to Joy
and Comfort, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 5. 'Tis a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting,
but a curing Sorrow. The
Word of God taketh care, that a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
who hath foully miscarried, should
not be swallowed up of over-much grief,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. In the general, Repentance
and Mortification are our Physick to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
the noxious Humours, that would
bring us, not only to Death, but to Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
and to keep the Soul in due
plight and health. And then for Self-Government;
We are to bridle our Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Appetites: Gal. 5. 24. <hi>They that
are Christ's, have crucified the Flesh, with
the Affections and Lusts.</hi> The bridling our
Passions, 'tis but forbidding us to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
and throw out every thing that
would disquiet the Soul. Christ's great
care was, that the reasonable Creature
might live in Peace, and Holy Security;
therefore hath discharged our <hi>Cares,</hi> and
<hi>Sorrows,</hi> and <hi>Fears:</hi> Our Cares, that
they might not distract our Minds: Phil.
4. 6. <hi>Be careful for nothing.</hi> And, 1 <hi>Pet.
5. 7. Cast all your care upon the Lord.</hi> These
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64994:47"/>
Prohibitions shew you the Goodness of
Christ; He hath made it unlawful for you
to be troubled, and to perplex your
Minds with anxious and distrustful
Thoughts. Oh! what pleasant Lives
might we live, if we could intirely cast
our selves into the Arms of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
all things to the Wisdom and powerful
Conduct of his Providence! The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is as plentiful also in forbidding Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
1 Thess. 4. 13. <hi>Sorrow not as those
that are without Hope.</hi> Dejection and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
of Spirit is your Sin. So for
Fear; Isa. 41. 10. <hi>Fear not, for I am
with thee: be not dismayed, for I am thy
God.</hi> Heb. 13. 6. <hi>So that we may boldly
say, The Lord is my Helper, I will not fear
what Man can do unto me.</hi> What should
a Christian fear? Dangers by the way?
God is his Helper: To be cast into Hell
when he goeth out of the World? Christ
hath shewed him how to flee from Wrath
to come: He feareth it with a Fear of
Caution, so as to shun it; but not with a
Fear of Perplexity, so as to disquiet and
perplex his Soul, for Jesus hath delivered
him from Wrath to come, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 10.
Christianity is as contrary to Sadness and
Misery, as Life to Death, and Light to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64994:48"/>
Darkness: For the other, the crucifying
and bridling of our Lusts, which carry us
to the good things of this World; why,
that is troublesome, to be debarred of
the Delights which Nature affects! But
here are no rigorous Exactions, but such
as are agreeable to the reasonable Nature:
Christ hath forbidden us no Pleasure, but
what may be a Sin, or a Snare to us: He
would not have Man to degenerate and
turn Beast. All Christ's Restraints are but
necessary Cautions for our safety: Is it
burdensome to a Man to keep out of
Danger's way, and to avoid such things
as are destructive to his Soul? If a Friend
will take out of our hands, the Knife
with which we would not only cut our
Fingers, but our Throats; Is he to be
blamed? Or is he your Enemy, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth
you to drink Poison? Forbidden
Fruit costs dear in the Issue.</p>
                  <p>5. For those Duties which concern our
Neighbour. To love all Men; to do
good to all Men, 'tis a Blessed and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
thing, to be giving rather than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
<hi>Acts</hi> 20. 35. The delight of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good, is much more than the cost;
'tis to be as earthly Gods among our
Neighbours. This Work rewardeth it
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64994:48"/>
self, because 'tis such a contentment and
satisfaction to our Minds. For Justice:
To do, as we would be done to; what
more pleasant? We would have others
bound by these Laws, why not our selves?
'Tis horrible to require one measure of
dealing from them to us, and use a quite
contrary our selves! Would Men hate,
defraud, oppress others, and expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but kind and righteous dealing from
them? this is a gross partiality: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as our Interest calleth for Justice, so
doth our Conscience; and it would be a
trouble and an affront to Reason not to do
it. So for Fidelity in our Relations:
These things maintain order of Families,
and conduce to our safety and private
peace, as well as they belong to our Duty
to God: So that on which side soever we
look, we see what Matter of Joy there is
in Christ.</p>
                  <p>I come now to shew you,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Reasons why Christians
are not sacred and sincere in their Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
unless they keep up this rejoicing in
Christ.</p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:64994:49"/>
                  <p>1. We do not else give Christ his due
Honour, if we do not esteem him who is
so excellent in himself, and so beneficial
to us, even to a degree of Rejoycing:
The magnifying of Christ was intended by
God, in the whole Business of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
and Deliverance, that we might
esteem him, delight in him, count all
things Dung and Dross, that we might
gain him: Now we do not comply with
this End, but have mean thoughts of his
Grace, if we be not affected with Joy at
it.</p>
                  <p>It argueth a double defect;</p>
                  <p>(1.) That we are not sensible of our
great misery without him.</p>
                  <p>Nor, (2.) affected with the great Love
he hath shewed in our Deliverance, and
the Felicity accruing to us thereby.</p>
                  <p>(1.) We are not duly sensible of our
great Misery without him. Alas, What
could we have done, without his Passion
and Intercession? If he had not died for
Sinners, What had you to answer to the
T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rrors of the Law, the Accusations of
your Consciences, the Fears of Hell, and
approaching Damnation? How could you
look God in the Face, or think one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
thought of him? Had we wept
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64994:49"/>
out our Eyes, and prayed out our Hearts,
and never committed Sin again; this
would not have made God satisfaction for
Sin past: Paying new Debts, doth not
quit old Scores: Long enough might we
have lain in our Blood, e're we could
have found out a Ransom which God
would accept; besides him there is no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.
And then for his Intercession: If
he did not hide your nakedness, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
you a daily Pardon, you would not
be an hour longer out of Hell. If he did
not bring you to God, you could have
no comfortable access to him: Your
Prayer would be cast back as Dung in
your Faces, if the Merit of his Sacrifice
did not make them accepted. And shall
all this be told you, and owned by you
for Truth; and will you not rejoice that
God hath found a Ransom, and provided
an Intercessor for you? Surely it cannot
be imagined that you are sensible of your
case, if you be not thankful for your
Remedy.</p>
                  <p>(2.) You are not affected with the
great Love which Christ hath shewed in
your Deliverance; nor the Felicity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruing
to you thereby. 'Tis said, <hi>Ephes.
3. 19. That you may know the Love of God
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64994:50"/>
which passeth knowledg.</hi> Before he had
pressed them to make it their study to
comprehend the heighth, length, and
breadth; and when they have all done,
the Love of Christ passeth Knowledg:
Christ would pose Men and Angels with
an heap of Wonders, in delivering us
from Misery and Sin. Now should not
we rejoice and make our boast of this!
Surely, we vilify and bring down the
price of these Wonders of Love, if we
entertain them with cold Thoughts, and
without some considerable Acts of Joy
and Thankfulness. Shall Angels wonder,
and we the Parties interessed not rejoice!
Certainly we are not affected with the
great Felicity accruing to us. Felicity
cannot be sought after without the highest
Affections and Endeavours. Now if we
can rejoice in Trifles, and not rejoice in
the Love of God; How can we be said to
mind these things?</p>
                  <p>2. A Man's Joy distinguisheth him.
There is a seeking Joy, and a complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Joy. Psal. 119. 14. <hi>I have rejoiced in
the Way of thy Testimonies, as much as in
all Riches.</hi> 'Tis good to observe what it
is that putteth Gladness into our Hearts:
The Love of God, and his Goodness in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64994:50"/>
Christ. Every Man is discovered by his
complacency, or displiciency. Psalm. 4.
7. <hi>Thou hast put Gladness into my Heart,
more than in the time that their Corn and
their Wine increased.</hi> Rom. 8. 5. <hi>They that
are after the Flesh, do mind the things of
the Flesh: but they that are after the Spirit,
the things of the Spirit.</hi> To rejoice in the
Creatures, as accommodating or pleasing
the Flesh, is the Joy of the Carnal: To
rejoice in outward Ordinances and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
without other things, is the Joy of
the Hypocrite and common Professors.
Let us carry it a little farther; The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
and Damned, are out of all hope
and possibility of Joy: The Angels, and
glorified Saints, rejoice in the full fruition
of God: There is <hi>Gaudium Viae,</hi> and
<hi>Gaudium Patriae;</hi> there is the Joy of the
<hi>Way,</hi> and the Joy of our <hi>Home,</hi> at our
Journey's End. The <hi>latter</hi> is set forth
Psal. 16. 11. <hi>In thy presence is fulness of
Ioy; at thy right Hand are Pleasures for
evermore.</hi> The <hi>other</hi> is in Christ, and the
use of his healing and recovering Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,
and the desires and hopes of the
Glory to come. This is the Joy, or well-pleasedness
of mind, which is proper to
us in our Journey: 1 Pet. 1. 8. <hi>In whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64994:51"/>
ye rejoice with Ioy unspeakable, and
full of Glory.</hi> The Comfort of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
differeth from that which a Man hath
in Heaven: 'Tis a Joy that he hath, as he
is going Home; and therefore how should
the serious Christian be described, but by
his rejoicing in Christ Jesus?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. To reprove those that cannot
keep up their Rejoycing in Christ Jesus,
as soon as they are mated with any Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
or Affliction in the World. Is not
Grace better than any natural Comfort
taken from us? Heb. 12. 11. <hi>No chastning
for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
grievous; Nevertheless, afterwards it yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the peaceable Fruit of Righteousness,
unto them which are exercised thereby.</hi> Surely
when we have such cause of rejoycing in
Christ, to be dejected with every little
Adversity, sheweth weak Faith. Have
you Peace with God, and Communion
with him at every turn? and shall a blast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Creature destroy all your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort?
Have you hope of Glory, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
you bear a Disappointment in the
World? Are you assured of the Care of
your Heavenly Father, and his particular
Providence over you, and yet so full of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64994:51"/>
grudging and repining Thoughts, when
he retrencheth you a little, and blasteth
your worldly Probabilities? Surely it
argueth too much addictedness to present
Comforts, and love of the ease of the
Flesh! Have you a due sense of the World
to come, and that better, and enduring
Substance; and yet complain so bitterly
of Worldly Losses? Have you a God in
Covenant with you, who hath engaged
all his Love, Wisdom, and Power, to
help you, and to turn all things to your
Good? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. What though the
tryal of your Faith and Patience be very
sore? Did you capitulate with God, and
bargain with him how much you would
suffer the Flesh to be cros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed, and that in
such sharp Afflictions you would be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that your Gourd should not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
smitten and dried up? You can
bear any other Cross but this; but was this
excepted out of your Resignation?</p>
                  <p>2. It reproveth those that cherish a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Rejoicing. A Believer should rejoice
in Christ Jesus. Luke 10. 19, 20. <hi>Behold,
I give unto you Power to tread on Serpents,
and Scorpions, and over all the Power of the
Enemy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Notwithstanding, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
not, that the Spirits are subject unto
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64994:52"/>
you: but rather rejoice, because your Names
are written in Heaven.</hi> Rejoice not in
this, that you are in Dignity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
This is not your Felicity, nor the
direct way to your Felicity; the higher
you climb, your Station is the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous:
They are safer that stand on the
Ground, than those that are on a Pinacle:
Rejoice not, in that you have abundance
of earthly Riches, but that you have a
taste of higher and better things: Be not
affected so deeply with lower Mercies, as
to overlook the special Mercies that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
Salvation: Rejoice not in this,
that you have convenient Habitations in
this World; but in that you have a Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God, an House not made with
Hands, Eternal in the Heavens: In that
you have comely Bodies, but that you
have hopes of a better Resurrection, <hi>when
this mortal shall put on Immortality.</hi> Not
in the Nobility of your Birth, but that
you are born of the Spirit. John 1. 12,
13. <hi>To as many as received him, to them
gave he Power to become the Sons of God,
even to them that believe on his Name: which
were born, not of Blood, nor of the Will of
the Flesh, nor of the Will of Man, but of
God.</hi> Rejoice not in that you have
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64994:52"/>
great Friends to stand by you; but that in
the New Covenant you are made a Friend
of God, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was. Not in that
you have costly Accommodations to please
the Flesh: No, this may be the bane of
your Souls: Rom. 8. 13. <hi>They that live
after the Flesh, shall die.</hi> And, <hi>Luke 16.
25. Son, Remember that thou in thy Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
receivedst thy good things. (Dives</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
deliciously every day, and <hi>Lazarus</hi>
was full of Sores, and desirous to be fed
with the Crumbs which fell from the Rich
Man's Table): <hi>Thou hast received thy good
Things, and</hi> Lazarus <hi>evil Things: but now
he is Comforted, and thou art Tormented.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Is to incourage you to Rejoice
in Christ Jesus. Now because we are
helpers of your Joy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. And
God is best pleased with this frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 16. I shall resume the
main Discourse; And,</p>
                  <p>1. Handle the Nature of it.</p>
                  <p>2. Shew you whether this Joy may be
without Assurance.</p>
                  <p>3. Shew you the spiritual Profit of it.</p>
                  <p>4. The Helps or Means by which it is
raised in us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:64994:53"/>1. <hi>For the Nature of it.</hi> 'Tis an Act
of Love, begotten in us by the sense of the
Love of Christ, revealed in the Word, and
shed abroad in our Hearts by the Holy Ghost;
whereby the Soul is more affected with delight
in the Grace of the Redeemer, than with all
other things whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>In which Description, Observe, 1. 'Tis
an Act of Love. The Acts of Love are
two: <hi>Desire,</hi> and <hi>Delight.</hi> They both
agree in this, That they are conversant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
good, and are founded in esteem:
We think it good. They differ, because
<hi>Desire</hi> is the Motion and Exercise of Love,
and <hi>Delight</hi> the Quiet and Repose of it.
<hi>Desire</hi> is expressed in that Speech, <hi>Psalm.
63. 8. My Soul followeth hard after thee.</hi>
A Believer cannot forbear to seek after
God. <hi>Desire</hi> of Union, keepeth us up
in the pursuit of him. <hi>Delight</hi> is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in that form of Speech, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 5, 6.
<hi>The Lord is the Portion of my Inheritance,
and my Cup. The Lines are fallen unto me
in a pleasant place; yea, I have a goodly He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage.</hi>
He hath all his Joy, and Pleasure,
and Contentment in God. <hi>Desire,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
some want or absence of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued
Object: <hi>Delight,</hi> some kind of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment:
Either he is ours, or might be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64994:53"/>
ours if we would our selves. For the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
is cause of Joy, as well as the Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
If our Desires have reached the
lovely Object, 'tis cause of Joy; or if it
be within our reach. As when Christ and
his Benefits are offered to us, and left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our choice. And therefore 'tis said,
Jonah 2. 8. <hi>They that observe lying Vanities,
forsake their own Mercies. Their own,</hi>
though not possessed by them, yet they
are offered to them: They might have
been their own, if they did not exclude
themselves: The Object is in a sort pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and brought home to us in the Offers
of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>2. 'Tis an Act of Love begotten in us,
by the sense of the Love of Christ: For
Love only begetteth Love; 1 <hi>Iohn 4.
19. We love him, because he loved us first.</hi>
The Object of Love, is Goodness: Now
we love God in Christ, for the Goodness
that is in him, the Goodness that floweth
from him, and the Goodness we expect
from him; all these attract our Love.</p>
                  <p>(1.) The Goodness that is in him; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and Beneficial: Moral, which is his
Holiness, <hi>Psal. 119. 140. Thy Word is very
pure, therefore thy Servant loveth it.</hi> If
we Love his Law, for the purity thereof,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64994:54"/>
then certainly we must love God, how
else can we study to imitate him? for we
imitate only that which we love, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in as good. Then for his Beneficial
Goodness; Psal. 100. 5. <hi>For the Lord is
Good, his Mercy is everlasting; and his
Truth endureth to all Generations.</hi> And,
Psal. 119. 68. <hi>Thou art Good, and dost
good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(2.) The Goodness that floweth from
him: Not only in our Creation, but our
Redemption by Christ, which is the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous
Instance of his Goodness to
Man. Titus 3. 4. <hi>After the kindness and
love of God our Saviour towards Man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,</hi>
&amp;c. (In the Creation, there was
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in Redemption, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
That God found a Ransom for us, and so
great as his only begotten Son; this was
Love and Goodness indeed.</p>
                  <p>(3.) The Goodness we expect from
him, both in this World, and the next:
Here, Reconciliation, and Remission of
Sins, which is a Blessing that doth much
draw the Heart of Man to delight in
Christ. <hi>For she loved much, to whom
much was forgiven,</hi> Luke 7. 47. We keep
off from a condemning God, but draw
nigh to a pardoning God. Therefore the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64994:54"/>
Apostle saith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 19. The bringing in
of this better Hope by the Gospel, doth
cause us to draw nigh to God. Being at
peace with God, and reconciled to him,
we may have access with confidence, and
boldness, to the Throne of Grace, are
no more at distance with God, looking
upon him as a consuming Fire. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
giveth us liberty to come to him, and
expect the Mercy and Bounty of God,
through Jesus Christ. So in the next
World Eternal Life and Glory, which is
our great Reward, merited by Christ;
Mat. 5. 12. <hi>Rejoice, and be exceeding glad,
for great is your Reward in Heaven.</hi> This
is a solid, lasting, satisfying, substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Good. Worldly Joys are but seeming,
they appear and vanish in a moment, every
blast of Temptation scattereth them.
Well then, offers of Pardon, and Life by
Christ, are the Matters of this Joy, as
they free us from the greatest Miseries, and
bring us to the enjoyment of the truest
Happiness. If you ask me then, Why is
a Christian described rather by rejoicing
in Christ, than by rejoycing in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of Sins, and Eternal Blessedness? I
Answer, Because Christ is the Author and
Procurer of these things to us; And by
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64994:55"/>
our Joy, we express not only our esteem
of these Benefits, but our gratitude and
thankfulness for the Mercy and Bounty
of God, and the great Love of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
                  <p>3. The Description sheweth, how the
sence of this Goodness is begotten in us:
The Love of Christ is revealed in the
Word, and shed abroad in our Hearts, by
the Holy Ghost; And I add, Believed
by Faith, and improved by Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>(1.) 'Tis revealed in the Gospel, or
Word of Salvation which is sent to us.
Therefore 'tis said, <hi>Acts 13. 48. When
the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and
glorified the Word of God; and as many as
were ordained to Eternal Life, believed.</hi>
Surely the Mind of Man, which is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
discomforted, and weakned, and
strangely haunted with Doubts and Fears
about the pardon of Sin, and Eternal
Life, is mightily revived and encouraged
with these glad Tydings of this Salvation,
dispensed to us by a sure Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi>
6. 18. And if the Gentiles that heard
these things were glad, proportionably we
should be glad, for the Gospel should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be as stale News to Sinners, or as a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64994:55"/>
Jest often told: Our Necessities are as
deep as theirs, and the Covenant standeth
as firm to us, as it did to them: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if we have the Heart of a guilty Man,
it should be as welcome to us.</p>
                  <p>(2.) 'Tis shed abroad in our Hearts by
the Holy Ghost. So much is asserted by
the Apostle. Rom. 5. 5. <hi>The Love of God
is shed abroad in our Hearts by the Holy
Ghost which is given unto us.</hi> Our dry
Reason cannot give such a lively sense of
these Comforts, as the Revelation of the
Holy Ghost. And this is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a believing by Tradition, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
by Inspiration. Believing by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
giveth us but cold thoughts of
these Mysteries; but believing by Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
warmeth the Heart, and reviveth it
with an unspeakable Joy; and is called,
<hi>tasting the good Word;</hi> which is the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of those who are enlightned by the
Spirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. And a tasting that the
Lord is gracious, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3. which much
differeth from the common reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
those things which Flesh and Blood
may give us, or the bare reports of Men
stir up in us. The Spirits light is lovely,
and ravisheth, and tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sporteth the Soul;
And where it is permanent, and rooted, it
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64994:56"/>
effectually changeth the Soul. Some<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> are
altogether careless, not affected at all with
these things, as the habituated worldly
Sinner, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. They are folly to
him. For Spiritual Things must be spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
discerned: Some are to a degree
affected by the common Work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5, 6. but 'tis not rooted, 'tis
not predominate, so as to control other Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and Delights; they have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing
in the Offers of Pardon and Life,
but 'tis a Joy that leaveth some darling
Sin still predominant. But there is a third
sort, that have such a taste of these things,
that they are renewed and changed by it,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 6. Now then, if you would have
this rejoicing in Christ Jesus, you must
apply your selves to Christ, in the use of
the appointed means, for the renewing of
your Natures; for Love and Delight are
never forced, nor will be drawn forth by
bare Commands and Threatnings, yea,
and not by the proposal of Promises,
though the Injoiments be never so great
and glorious. This may a little stir us,
and this is the Matter of Joy, but not the
Cause of Joy. But this Joy, proceedeth
partly from the Inclination, when the
Heart is suited, and partly from the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64994:56"/>
goodness of the Object: and both
are powerfully done by the Holy Spirit,
as the Heart is renewed, and the Object
is most effectually represented by him,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 17, 18. And this we must wait
for.</p>
                  <p>(3.) 'Tis received, and believed by
Faith. This is often told us in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
1 <hi>Pet. 1. 18. In whom believing, ye
rejoice with Ioy unspeakable, and full of
Glory.</hi> And, <hi>Rom. 15. 13. The God of
Hope fill you with Ioy and Peace in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</hi>
We cannot be affected with the
great Things Christ hath done and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
for us, till we believe them. There
is in Faith, three things, <hi>Assent, Consent,</hi>
and <hi>Affiance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1.) <hi>Assent,</hi> or a firm and certain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of the Truth of the Gospel concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ, as the only sufficient Saviour,
by whom alone God will give us the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of Sins, and Eternal Life. John 4.
42. <hi>We have heard him our selves, and know,
that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of
the World.</hi> And, <hi>Iohn 6. 69. We believe
and are sure, that thou art that Christ, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
Son of the Living God.</hi> When we are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
perswaded of this, as we are of any
thing that appeareth true to us; this stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64994:57"/>
up Joy. Others have but an hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
Knowledg, not a Believing Assent.
Surely Christ is a delectable Object, what
hindereth then, but that we rejoice in
him! Nothing but want of Faith: For if
this be true, we so Necessitous, and he
so Al-sufficient a Remedy; why are we
not so affected with these things, as the
worth of them doth deserve! Nothing
can be rationally said, but that we are not
soundly perswaded of the truth of it.</p>
                  <p>(2.) A <hi>Consent.</hi> This Grace is dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by a Convenant which bindeth mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally;
assureth us of Happiness, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
Duty from us. Therefore, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
Consent, or a readiness to fulfil
those terms expressed in the Promise, is
required of us; or a resolution to repent
and obey the Gospel. Christ hath Offices
and Relations that imply our Comfort;
and other Offices and Relations which
imply our Duty: Or rather, the same do
both; He is our Teacher, and King, as
well as our Priest; and we must submit
to be ruled and taught by him, as well as
depend upon the Merit of his Sacrifice
and Intercession. Heb. 5. 9. <hi>And being
made perfect, he became the Author of Et<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Salvation to all them that obey him.</hi> And
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64994:57"/>
they are so taught the Truth that is in Jesus,
that they put off the Old Man, and put
on the New, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 20, 21. True Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
must be Scholars daily learning
somewhat from Christ: yea, his Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
implieth Duty, Dependance, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Addresses. A broken-hearted coming
to God by him: As his Kingship and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
Office implieth privilege also.
His defending and teaching us by his
Spirit.</p>
                  <p>(3.) There is <hi>Affiance:</hi> Which is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
of our Hearts, or a relying upon
God, promising remission of Sins, and
Eternal Life for Christ's sake alone; that
he will be as good as his word, while we
diligently use the Means ordained to this
end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 7. And this Confidence
hath an influence upon this Joy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 6.
or a delightful sense of our Redeemer's
Grace.</p>
                  <p>4. 'Tis improved by Meditation: For
the greatest things do not work, unless
we think of them, and work them into
our Hearts. The natural way of Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, That Object <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tir up Thoughts,
and Thoughts stir up Affections; <hi>Psal.
104. 34. My meditation of him shall be
sweet: I will be glad in the Lord.</hi> The
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64994:58"/>
more frequent and serious Thoughts we
have of the Love of God in Christ, and
the more deep and ponderous they are,
the more do they blow up this Holy Fire
into a Flame. Now for this end was the
Lord's Supper instituted, where the whole
Gospel is applied and sealed to us, that
this delight might be afresh acted and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in us at the Lord's Table, while our
minds are taken up in considering Christ
the great Apostle and High Priest of our
Confession, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 1. Surely it should
not be an idle and fruitless Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
it should stir up Love, and what
stirreth up Love, stirreth up Delight. I
come now to the last part of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>The particular Affection caused by
this sense is mentioned:</hi> We delight in the
Grace of the Redeemer, more than in all
other things whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>Where, 1. Take noice of the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it self.</p>
                  <p>Then, 2. The Degree of it.</p>
                  <p>1. The Affection it self: <hi>Which is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
or a well-pleasedness of Mind, in the
Grace that is brought to us by the Knowledg
of Christ.</hi> This inlargeth the Heart, and
filleth it with a Sweetness and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64994:58"/>
and the Vent of it is Praise, for the
Heart being inlarged, cannot hold and
contain it self: Psal. 33. 14. <hi>I will shew
forth all they Praise in the Gates of the
Daughter of Sion: I will rejoice in thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
Joy cannot be kept within doors,
it will break out in all suitable ways of
Expression: The Heart doth first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice,
and then the Tongue doth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow:
The Heart is filled with Joy, and
then the Tongue with Thanksgiving. So
Psal. 35. 9. <hi>My Soul shall be joyful in the
Lord; it shall rejoice in his Salvation.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
disposeth the Heart to praise so
much, as this Holy Joy. There is no true
Thanksgiving, if this be not at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of it.</p>
                  <p>2. For the Degree: The Heart doth
delight in Christ above all other Things:
As to the sensitive Expression, in the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
stirring of Joy, we may to appearance
be more affected with outward Benefits;
because fleshly Objects do more work
upon our fleshly senses, as carrying a
greater suitableness to them. Religion is
a grave severe thing, not seen so much in
actual Transports, as in the habitual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency,
and well-pleasedness of the Mind:
yet in sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mn Duties, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re may be as
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64994:59"/>
great Ravishment of Soul; Psalm. 6. 35.
<hi>My Soul shall be ravished as with Marrow
and Fatness; and my Mouth shall praise
thee with joyful Lips.</hi> When they feel the
Love of God shed abroad in their Hearts,
they are in effect transported with it,
more than with all the Delicates and Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets
of the World, and cannot hold from
praising God: But generally it must be
measured by our solid complacency, and
judicious esteem: What we prize most,
and would least want, and would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
for all other things; so the Saints re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
in God and Christ, more than in any
worldly Matter whatsoever. <hi>Psalm. 73.
25. Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and
there is none upon Earth that I desire besides
thee.</hi> Psal. 119. 14. <hi>I have rejoiced in the
way of thy Testimonies, as much as in all
Riches.</hi> Psal. 4. 6, 7. <hi>There be many that
say, Who will shew us any good? Lord lift
thou up the light of thy Countenance upon us;
That hast put Gladness in my Heart, more
than in the time that their Corn and their
Wine increased.</hi> Psalm. 63. 3. <hi>Because thy
loving Kindness is better than Life, my
Lips shall praise thee.</hi> This is that which
they love most, and keep best, and are
most loth to want. This is that which
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64994:59"/>
giveth a value to Life it self; and without
which, that which is most precious and
desirable, is little or nothing worth; and
giveth them more comfort, then what is
most comfortable in this World; and is
the most chearful Employment for their
Thoughts to think upon. This is delight
in Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Whether this may be had without
Assurance? And can those who are dark in
their interest in Christ, and know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they have any Grace or no, rejoice in
him? To this I Answer; Yes certainly:
For there are general Grounds of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing;
for the Gospel bringeth glad
Tydings to Sinners, as it offereth to them
a way how to escape out of their misery,
and enter into the Peace of God.</p>
                  <p>But more distinctly;</p>
                  <p>1. The Scripture speaketh of a two-fold
rejoicing in Christ; Before Faith,
and After Faith. Before Faith is full
grown, and is but in the making, as those,
Acts 13. 48.—<hi>When they heard this, they
were glad,</hi> &amp;c. And he that had found
the true Treasure, for Joy thereof sold all
that he had, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 44. There was
Joy before the thorow consent, though
introductive of it, yet antecedent to it.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64994:60"/>
And the reason is, because God hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them the way, how to free themselves
from Misery, and to enjoy true Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Happiness. Now if there may be
a Joy before Faith, certainly before Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
The very offer of a Remedy, is
comfortable when in misery. And then
there is a Joy after Faith; as Joy and
Peace in Believing: when they take the
course to get this Liberty and Deliverance
by Christ; yet this is Faith, not Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
As a sick Man, when he heareth
of an able Physician, who hath cured
many of the same Disease wherewith he is
oppressed, he rejoiceth, and conceiveth
some hope that he may be cured also;
When he hath lighted upon this Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and beginneth to make use of his
Healing Medicines, he is more glad, and
expecteth the Cure: But when he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
recovered, and feeleth it, then he
is glad indeed. So when a broken-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Creature heareth the glad Tidings of
the Gospel, that Christ Jesus came into
the World to save Sinners; he rejoiceth
that God hath found out such a Saviour
to recover the lapsed Estate of Mankind:
But when he submitteth to Christ's Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Methods, and trusts himself with his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64994:60"/>
skill and fidelity, he is more comforted,
and doth more intimately feel the benefit
of this course in his own Soul; but as he
groweth more assured of his Health and
Salvation, his Comfort still increaseth, and
his Joy is more unspeakable and glorious:
So that this Joy may be without assurance,
for the Causes of it at first, are Knowledg
and Faith.</p>
                  <p>2. There is a Joy that accompanieth
seeking, even before we attain what we
seek after. Psal. 105. 3. <hi>Let the Heart of
them rejoice that seek the Lord.</hi> There is
a great deal of Contentment in this course,
though that complacential Joy, which is
our full Reward, be yet reserved for us;
yet there is a Joy in seeking: Better be a
Seeker, than a Wanderer. This Blessed
Saviour am I waiting upon! Though we
have attained to little Communion with
him, yet 'tis a comfort, that we are seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
farther measure: Delight and Joy
keepeth up our endeavours.</p>
                  <p>3. When our Right is cleared, then we
have more abundant Joy. 2 Pet. 1. 10, 11.
<hi>Wherefore the rather, Brethren, give diligence
to make your Calling and Election sure;
for if ye do these things, you shall never fall:
For so an Entrance shall be administred to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:64994:61"/>
you abundantly, into the Everlasting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ.</hi>
Some are afar off, others not far from the
Kingdom of God: Others make an hard
shift to go to Heaven, through many
Doubts and Fears; some sail into the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of Glory with full Sails, with much
Joy and Peace of Soul.</p>
                  <p>3. I shall shew you the Spiritual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of this Joy.</p>
                  <p>(1.) 'Tis such a Joy as doth enlarge our
Heart in Duty, and strengthens us in the
way of God: Nehem. 8. 10. <hi>The Ioy of
the Lord is your strength.</hi> There is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
deadness and dulness in Holy Duties,
which we often find in our selves, which
cometh to pass partly from the back-bias
of Corruption, weakning our Delight in
God; and partly from the remissness of
our Will towards Spiritual and Heavenly
Things: Now the most proper and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cure of it, is this Delight and Rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in Christ; for a Man will readily do
those things which he delighteth in, though
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oilsom and difficult. Let the Heart be
but affected with the Grace of Christ, and
our Joy will soon vent it self in a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and delightful Obedience; 1 John 5.
3. <hi>For this is the Love of God, that we
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64994:61"/>
keep his Commandments, and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
are not grievous.</hi> Psalm. 119.
14. <hi>I have rejoiced in the way of thy Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
as much as in all Riches.</hi> Psal. 40.
8. <hi>I delight to do thy Will, O my God; yea,
thy Law is within my Heart.</hi> The hardest
Services are pleasant to one that delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in Christ; they are sweetned by his
Love, and quickned, and inlivened by
the sense and esteem that we have of the
Benefits he procureth for us. Shall we
refuse to do any thing for such a compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
Saviour, who died for us, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
us to God, and bring us to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
fruition of him? So that the Life
of all Obedience dependeth on this Joy.</p>
                  <p>(2.) 'Tis our Cordial, to fortify us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the Calamities and Infelicities of
the present World, and maketh every bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thing sweet to us; whether they be
the common Afflictions incident to Man,
or Persecutions for Righteousness-sake.</p>
                  <p>1. For the common Afflictions: A
Christian is never in a right Frame, 'till he
hath learned Contentment in all Estates.
That he doth not over-joy in worldly
Comforts, nor over-grieve for worldly
Losses, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 3. But carrieth himself
as one that is above the Hopes and Fears
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64994:62"/>
of the World: Now there are many
Means to be used, that we may get this
humble and composed frame of Heart;
but the most constant and effectual care of
worldly Sorrow, is to keep our rejoycing
in Jesus Christ, and to be satisfied with
the Fruits of his Redemption: This, like
the Wood that was cast in at <hi>Marah,</hi> to
make the bitter Waters sweet, doth swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
our Troubles, and supply our Wants,
and swallow up our Griefs and Infelicities;
for we have that in Christ, which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the natural comfort taken from
us: Hab. 3. 17, 18. <hi>Although the Fig-tree
shall not blossom, neither shall Fruit be
in the Vines; the labour of the Olive shall
fail, and the Fields shall yield no Meat;
the Flock shall be cut off from the Fold, and
there shall be no Herd in the Stalls. Yet
will I rejoice in the Lord: I will joy in the
God of my Salvation.</hi> He supposeth not
only some want, but an utter destitution
and desolation of all things, and yet his
Heart was kept up by Joy in God. So
elsewhere, <hi>Rom. 12. 12. Rejoicing in Hope,
patient in Tribulation, continuing instant in
Prayer.</hi> The Comfort of Reconciliation
with God, and the Hopes of Heaven, do
most breed Patience in Afflictions: And
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64994:62"/>
certainly Joy is the best cure of Sorrow.
<hi>Contraria contrariis cura<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tur.</hi> Now the
Joy that must be opposed to worldly
Sorrow, is not Worldly, but either Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
or Heavenly Joy. Spiritual in the
present Fruits of Christ's Death; <hi>Heb.
12. 11. Now no chastening for the present
seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless,
afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable
Fruit of Righteousness unto them which are
exercised thereby.</hi> Heavenly; surely Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Joys will best vanquish Temporal
Sorrows; <hi>Heb. 12. 2. Looking unto Iesus
the Author and Finisher of our Faith; who
for the Ioy that was set before him, endured
the Cross, despising the shame, and is set
down at the right hand of the Throne of
God.</hi> This will enable us patiently and
chearfully to bear all things.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Persecutions: We need to be forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
against this, that we may boldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
our Faith in Christ, without any fear
of Sufferings, and may not faint under
them, but bear them with courage and
constancy. Now this is the Fruit of this
rejoicing in Christ; witness these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
Acts 5. 41. They went away rejoice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that they were counted worthy to suffer
shame for his Name. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 34. Ye took
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64994:63"/>
joyfully the spoiling of your Goods, knowing
in your selves, that ye have in Heaven, a
better and an enduring Substance. <hi>So,</hi> Mat.
5. 12. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for
great is your Reward in Heaven; for so
persecuted they the Prophets which were before
you. <hi>And in many other places; and,
1 Pet.</hi> 4. 13. Rejoice, in as much as ye are
partakers of Christ's Sufferings; that when
his Glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad
also with an exceeding Ioy. <hi>And,</hi> Iames
1. 4. Count it all Ioy, when ye fall into
divers Trials. <hi>Surely, Christ and Heaven
are worth something, and such Trials do
in part shew, how much we esteem him,
and value him, above any Interest of
ours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. It doth draw off the Heart from the
Delights of the Flesh: Not only <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria
contrariis curantur,</hi> but <hi>similia simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi>
Carnal Pleasures put the Soul out
of relish with better things, and draw off
the Heart from God. A fleshly Mind is
easily blinded, and inchanted with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Vanities. Therefore it concerneth us
to check our Inclination to sense-pleasing
and flesh-pleasing, which is so natural to
us. How shall it be cured, but by seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Delight elsewhere? Every Man
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64994:63"/>
must have some Oblation, for Love can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lie idle in the Soul; either his Love
is taken up with the Joys of Sense, or the
Joys of Faith; with vain Pleasures, or
with chast and spiritual Delights: The
one spoileth the taste of the other. A
Spiritual Mind, that is feasted with higher
Delights, cannot relish the Garlick, and
Onions, and Flesh-pots of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Cant.
1. 4. <hi>We will remember thy Loves more than
Wine.</hi> And a brutish Heart, that is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lost and sunk in these dreggy Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which gratify Sense, valueth not
the Favour of God, thinketh it <hi>Canting</hi>
to talk of Communion with him, and the
Joys of Hope to be fantastical Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
They love Pleasures more than God,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4. Now if we would restrain
and check this Inclination, we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
in Christ, delight our Minds and
Hearts in the remembrance of his Love
and Benefits. What-ever Pleasure a Man
doth find, or imagine to find in sensual
fleshly courses, that and much more is to
be had in Christ; where we rejoice at a
surer and more sincere rate; Ephes. 5. 4.
<hi>Not Iesting, but rather giving of Thanks.</hi>
Carnal Mirth doth not so chear World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
as the remembrance of the Favours
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64994:64"/>
and Blessings we have by Christ. Keep
the Heart thankful and sensible of God's
Goodness, and Christ's Love, and you
will not need vain Delights. So, <hi>Ephes.
5. 18. Be not drunk with Wine wherein is
Excess, but be filled with the Spirit.</hi> These
are Motives and Marks also, for by these
three things you may know whether you
have this Joy, yea or no.</p>
                  <p>4. The Helps or Means by which this
Joy is raised in us.</p>
                  <p>(1.) A sense of Sin and Misery: This
maketh you more sensible of the Mercy of
the Deliverance, and to be more affected
with it: As the grievousness of a Disease,
maketh the recovery more delightful. The
Law condemned you, his Ransom must
absolve you: Sin made you dead, his
Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e quickneth, and puts Life into you.
Always as our sense of Misery is, so is the
sense of the Recovery: if one be bitter,
the other is sweet. None prize and esteem
Christ so much, as the broken-hearted and
burdened.</p>
                  <p>(2.) An intire Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>idence of Christ:
For so it followeth, <hi>Have no Confidence
in the Flesh.</hi> If we have no Confidence
in the Flesh, and look for all from the
Mercy and Bounty of God, through
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64994:64"/>
Christ, we shall prize him. 1 Pet. 2. 7.
<hi>Vnto you therefore which believe, he is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
Phil. 3. 8. <hi>Yea doubtless, and I count
all things but loss for the Excellency of the
Knowledg of Christ Iesus my Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3.) A con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ant use of the Means
whereby this Joy may be fed and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in us; as the Word, Sacraments, and
Prayer. The Word; <hi>Psal. 119. 102. I
have not departed from thy Iudgments, for
thou hast taught me.</hi> Then Prayer; suing
out of our Right. John 11. 24. <hi>Ask,
and ye shall receive, that your Ioy may be
full.</hi> So for the Sacraments; Baptism:
Acts 8. 39. <hi>When they were come up out of
the Water, the Spirit caught away</hi> Philip;
<hi>so that the Eunuch saw him no more: and
he went on his way rejoicing.</hi> The Lord's
Supper; it is our Spiritual Refection.</p>
                  <p>(4.) <hi>Sincerity of Obedience:</hi> 1 Cor. 5.
8. Therefore let us keep the Feast, not with
old Leaven, neither with the Leaven of
Malice and Wickedness; but with the
unleavened Bread of Sincerity and Truth.
<hi>Practical Delight is the chiefest above
that of Contemplation, a more intimate
sense.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:64994:65"/>We come now to the last part of a
Christian's Character:—<hi>And have no
Confidence in the Flesh.</hi> To understand it,
consider there are two things called Flesh
in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>1. External Privileges belonging to the
worldly Life; such as Wealth, Greatness,
and worldly Honour: Now to glory in
these, is to glory in the Flesh; and to
trust in these, is to trust in the Flesh;
which should be far from Christians:
Jer. 9. 23, 24. <hi>Let not the wise Man glory
in his Wisdom, nor the mighty Man glory in
his Might. Let not the rich Man glory in
his Riches; But let him that glorieth, glory
in this, that he knoweth me, that I am the
Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Where the Prophet laboureth
to beat them off from their vain Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences,
that they might not rely upon
their Power, Policy, and Wealth; but
a saving Knowledg of, and Interest in
God, whose Goodness and Faithfulness
could only secure them against all Evils,
and procure them all manner of Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings.</p>
                  <p>2. The outward Duties and Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
of Religion, especially the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of <hi>Moses:</hi> Those consisting in
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64994:65"/>
External Observances, are called <hi>Flesh;
And to have confidence in the Flesh,</hi> is to
place our Confidence in External Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
and Duties. For the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth
himself, <hi>Vers. 4. Though I might
also have Confidence in the Flesh: if any other
Man thinketh he may have confidence in the
Flesh, I more.</hi> He was not any whit infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
to any of the Judaizing Brethren in
outward Privileges and Duties; yea, had
greater cause of glorying in the Flesh,
than any of the Pretenders among them.
And then instances in his Jewish Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<hi>Circumcision,</hi> his <hi>Family,</hi> his <hi>Sect,</hi> a
<hi>Pharisee;</hi> his Partial Obedience, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Righteousness, <hi>as to the Law blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</hi>
To rest on these things then, for
our Acceptance with God is, <hi>to have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in the Flesh.</hi> And elsewhere he saith,
Gal. 3. 3. <hi>Having begun in the Spirit, are
ye now made perfect in the Flesh.</hi> When
they reverted to the Ceremonies of the
Law. This is called Flesh, because they
consist in outward things: Corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is pleased with such things, and doth
plead and stand for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> That a good Christian doth not
place his Hope and Confidence of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64994:66"/>
acceptance with God in External Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
and Performances.</p>
                  <p>In the first Character, a Christian is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by his Worship; in the second,
by his Joy; in the third, by his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>In handling this Point, I shall shew
you:
<list>
                        <item>1<hi>st,</hi> What are these Externals which
are apt to tempt Men to a vain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</item>
                        <item>2<hi>dly,</hi> That naturally Men are for a
meer external way of serving God,
and place their whole Confidence
therein.</item>
                        <item>3<hi>dly,</hi> Why a good Christian should
have no Confidence in this External
Conformity to God's Law.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>1<hi>st,</hi> What are these Externals in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which are apt to tempt Men to a
vain Confidence. They may be referred
to two heads, They are either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by God, or invented by Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
God's Externals, or Man's Externals.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:64994:66"/>1. God's Externals: Such as he hath
instituted and appointed, either in the
Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> or in the Law of Christ.
In the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> such as Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
with all the appendant Rites; these
are called, <hi>Heb. 9. 10. Carnal Ordinances,
imposed on them, till the time of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>
These were to be observed,
while the Institution of them was in
force, and stood unrepealed, which was
done at the coming of Christ: <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.
23, 24. <hi>The hour cometh, and now is, when
the true Worshippers shall worship the Father
in Spirit, and in Truth: for the Father
seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and they that worship him, must worship
him in Spirit, and in Truth.</hi> These made
great trouble in the Infancy of the Church,
for the Jews, and Judaizing Christians
were loth to depart from the Rituals un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which they were bred and brought
up. Though Christ fully evidenced his
Commission from Heaven, to repeal those
Laws, and his Apostles strongly pleaded
the Ancient Prophecies which foretold it.
But these are no more of concernment to
us, except to direct us how to behave our
selves in like cases.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:64994:67"/>2. There are Externals in the Law of
Christ; such as the Sacraments, Baptism,
and the Lord's Supper; Hearing of the
Word, External Prayer, and the like.
Now the Rule is, that they must be used,
but the outward Act not rested in, as a
sufficient ground of our Acceptance with
God; used they must be in Faith and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
because God hath justified them
under great Penalties: As Circumcision,
while the Command was in force; <hi>Gen.
17. 14. The Man-child, whose Flesh is
not circumcised, shall be cut off from his
People; He hath broken my Covenant.</hi> So
Baptism; <hi>Mark 16. 16. He that believeth,
and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that
believeth not, shall be damned.</hi> Not want,
but neglect or contempt. Therefore all
these Duties must be used as Means of
Salvation, and as Expressions of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Truth of our Faith in God, and
Obedience to him; (we must not cast off
Ordinances) but yet they must not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
in, as sufficient Grounds of our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
with God. While Circumcision
was in force, they relied on it, as it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
them from other Nations, as
the genuine Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and so
reckoned to be within the Covenant.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64994:67"/>
But the Servants of God did always dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
this vain Confidence; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28,
29. <hi>He is not a Iew, which is one outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
neither is that Circumcision, which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in the Flesh: but he is a Iew, which is
one inwardly; and Circumcision is that of
the Heart, in the Spirit, and not in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
whose praise is not of Men, but of God.</hi>
They rejoiced in a shadow, when they
wanted the thing signified; if there were
no mortification of Sin, or putting off
the Body of the Sins of the Flesh. But
not only the Apostle, but the Prophet
long before disproveth their vain Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Jer. 9. 25, 26. <hi>Behold, the days
come, when I will punish them which are
circumcised with the uncircumcised,</hi> Egypt
<hi>and</hi> Edom, <hi>with the Children of</hi> Ammon
<hi>and</hi> Moab, <hi>are uncircumcised in Flesh, and
all the House of</hi> Israel <hi>is uncircumcised in
Heart.</hi> God would proceed against wicked
Persons and People, circumcised as well
as uncircumcised. Were those things spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to them only, and not to us also?
Surely all may learn from hence, that by
a bare submission to outward Rites, we
are not approved of God, without mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the true Reformation of Heart and
Life, and expecting the Pardon of our
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64994:68"/>
Sins by Jesus Christ. You are baptized;
but are you washed from your Sins? You
hear the Word; but is it the Power of
God to your Salvation? You frequent Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;
but is the Conscience of the
Bond of the Holy Oath, into which you
are entred, upon your Hearts? There is
more required in Christianity, than out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Profession, whether in Word or
Deed; Namely, the Conscience of your
Dedication to God; or else the Work
doth not go deep enough: 1 <hi>Cor. 13. 3.
Though I bestow all my Goods to feed the
Poor, and though I give my Body to be
burned, and have not Charity, it profiteth
me nothing.</hi> You content your selves
with your Tale, and number of Duties,
praying Morning and Evening, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so many Chapters: But where is the
Spirit, and the Fruit of all that you do?
They that are given to Fasting, think
themselves very devout, if they fast of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
be their Hearts never so full of ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour.
Many huddle over many Prayers,
but they do not go from their Heavenly
Father, with an Heavenly Mind: They
give Alms, but live loosly: As <hi>Michal</hi>
laid a Statue in <hi>David</hi>'s Bed, and covering
it with <hi>David</hi>'s Apparel, made <hi>Saul</hi>'s Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64994:68"/>
believe it was <hi>David</hi> himself sick
in Bed: So many Persons cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with certain External Actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to Religion, and the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
them truly sanctified and spiritual,
whenas indeed they are but Statues and
Apparitions of Devotion to God. But
this is but a vain shew, a placing the
Means, instead of the End; the Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
instead of the Ultimate End.</p>
                  <p>2. Man's Externals: Invented by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
by Laws of their own, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Observances of their own devising:
Men's whole Religion running out into
Externals, they are not contented with
the Forms of Worship instituted by God,
but add somewhat of their own, and love
to bind themselves in Chains of their own
making: As the Jews not being perfect
as appertaining to the Conscience, by the
use of the Instituted Ceremonies of <hi>Moses,</hi>
invented other things to make them more
perfect.</p>
                  <p>Now as to this, I shall only observe,</p>
                  <p>(1.) That as the out-side of Worship
is most minded by a Carnal Christian, so
the in-side by a renewed Christian: <hi>Mat.
15. 8. This People draweth nigh to me with
their Mouth, and honoureth me with their
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64994:69"/>
Lips, but their Heart is far from me.</hi> Their
Hearts are averse from God: The Carnal
Christian is all for uncovering the Head,
and bowing the Knee, but taketh no care
of the Heart; Isa. 58. 5. <hi>Is it such a Fast
that I have chosen? A day for a Man to
afflict his Soul? Is it to bow down his Head
as a Bulrush, and to spread Sack-cloth and
Ashes under him? wilt thou call this a Fast,
and an acceptable day unto the Lord?</hi> The
Pharisees were zealous for washing before
Meat, as if it were an holy religious Act,
because it was one of their own Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 2. But took no notice of
inward Defilement.</p>
                  <p>(2.) They are more zealous for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Inventions, than Moral, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Duties, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 3, 4. For the
Rudiments of the World, as the Apostle
calleth them, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10. than the unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable
Ordinances of Christ. For a
worldly Religion must be supported by
worldly Means.</p>
                  <p>(3.) I observe, That the more exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Pomp there is of Man's devising, the
less spiritual Truth; for it gratifieth the
natural Corruption, which is all for the
out-side: Some few Externals, God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for an Help, but when Men will
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64994:69"/>
be adding, they become a Burden and
an Impediment. God did not abrogate
his own Ceremonies, for Men to appoint
theirs.</p>
                  <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> That naturally Men are meerly
for an external way of serving God, and
place their Confidence therein.</p>
                  <p>Here I shall shew you;
<list>
                        <item>1. That their Hearts are set upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Worship.</item>
                        <item>2. That therein they place all their
Confidence.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. That naturally Mens Hearts are
chiefly set upon External Services.</p>
                  <p>And that (1.) out of laziness; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals
being more easy than worshipping
God in the Spirit. <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 23. They
tithe <hi>Mint,</hi> and <hi>Annise,</hi> and <hi>Cummin,
but omit the weightier things of the Law,
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Iudgment, Mercy,
Faith.</hi> Conscience is like the Stomach,
which naturally desireth to fill it self;
and when it cannot digest solid Food, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it self only with Wind. So here,
outward things are more easy; but morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Sin, and solid Godliness, is more
difficult; this the natural Man cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest,
and therefore culleth out the easier
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64994:70"/>
and cheaper sort of Religion, which puts
him to no great trouble or self-denial.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Out of their Indulgence to the
Flesh: A Man can spare any thing better
than his Lusts: His Estate, the present
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ase of the Body, their Children, any
thing for the Sin of their Souls, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.
6, 7, 8. The Question is not how to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
Justice, but how to appease Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
while they retain their Sins. They
would buy out their Peace with vast Sums
of Mony, mangle their Flesh, like the
Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> to spare the Sin of their
Souls; do any thing, endure any thing,
but the subd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing the Heart to God: The
sensual Nature of Man is such, that he is
loth to be crossed; if he must be crossed,
only a little, and but for a while; and
therefore affects an easy Religion, where
the Flesh is not crossed, or but a little
crossed. Now, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Luke 18. 9. <hi>Christ spake this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                        </gap>
that they were Righteous.</hi> There is such a
disposition in Men, that if by any means
they can hold up a pretence of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of their own, will not pray, and
wait, and consecrate, and devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to God, that they may attain his
Righteousness; if they have any thing to
plead, if they have a partial Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
if they be not to be numbred among
the worst of men. Luke 18. 11. <hi>The
Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself,
God I thank thee, that I am not as other Men
are, Extortioners, Vnjust, Adulterers, or
even as this Publican.</hi> If they have an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Righteousness, they will plead that;
<hi>I fast twice in the Week, I give tithe of all
that I possess,</hi> &amp;c. A legal Spirit is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to us: Though Men dare not pretend
to an universal Conformity to the Law in
a strict sense; yet if they can make a
shift to get any external Conformity to
the Law, they are confident of Divine
Acceptance: Yea, so sot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ish is their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
that they will catch hold of any
thing. Judg. 17. 13. <hi>Now I know God will
bless me, because I have a Levite to my Priest,</hi>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:64994:71"/>
giving him Meat and Drink, and about
fifty Shillings <hi>per Annum.</hi> So willing are
we to justify our selves, by something in
our selves, or done by our selves: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the Ell may be no broader than
the Cloth, they devise a short Exposition
of the Law, that they may entertain a
large Opinion of their own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                  <p>(4.) There is another Reason; Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.
External Forms of Religion, draw
an Interest after them: Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
saith, <hi>Rom. 2. 29. Whose praise is
not of Men, but of God.</hi> And, <hi>Gal. 1.
10. If I yet please Men, I were not the
Servant of Christ.</hi> And <hi>Rudiments of the
World,</hi> Col. 2. 10. It maketh a Man to
be applauded and countenanced by the
World. Let a Man betake himself to
such a Religion, there are these which will
back him, and stand by him; and their
disfavour and displeasure he shall incur i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
he forsake it: And where the false Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers
are the prevailing Party, he
runneth great hazard, by contradicting
such Form and Opinions. Therefore the
Heart of that Man that is set on Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
takes up with the Religion of his
Country, whether true or false.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:64994:71"/>2. They place their Confidence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
Every Man that hath a Conscience,
must have something to trust unto: Now
what feedeth his Confidence, but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
which he hath chosen? There are
two things which detain Men from God
and Christ: Some false Imaginary Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and some Counterfeit Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and wherein they please themselves. The
False Happiness is as their God, and the
Counterfeit Righteousness is as their Christ
and Mediator; and so they are secure and
sensless; and 'till God open their Eyes,
they neither seek after another Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
nor trouble themselves about the
way whereby they may attain it. That
Men set a false Happiness, is evident; for
ever since Man fell from God, he ran to
the Creature; <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 13. Left the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
for the Cistern: And if we can make
a shift to patch up a sorry Happiness apart
from God, we never care for him, nor
will not come at him, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 31. Our
Pleasure, our Profit, our Honour, that is
our God: And if we can enjoy these
things without any rubs, and checks, we
look no farther, and will not seek our
Happiness in an invisible God, nor wait to
injoy it in an invisible World. But the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64994:72"/>
second Error is, That there is something
instead of Christ to us, to keep the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science

                  <p>I come now to shew,</p>
                  <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> Why a good Christian should
have no Confidence in the Flesh.</p>
                  <p>1 Because till we are dead to the Law,
we cannot live to God: Now to be dead
to the Law, is nothing else but to have
our Confidence in the Flesh, or External
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, mortified. You hear often
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> dead to Sin, and dead to the
World, you must be also dead to the Law,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64994:72"/>
or otherwise you cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in Christ,
and bring forth Fruit unto God: <hi>Gal. 2.
19. For I through the Law, am dead to the
Law, that I may live unto God.</hi> And, <hi>Rom.
7. 4. By the Body of Christ ye are become
dead to the Law, that ye may be married to
another, even to him who is raised from the
dead.</hi> We grow dead to the <hi>Law,</hi> when
thereby we understand our sinful misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Estate without Christ, and how una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
we are to help our selves: By the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Power of the Law, we know our
Sins; by the condemning Power of the
Law, we know the misery and curse we
are subject unto; by the irritating Power
of the Law, we find that the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which the Law requireth is not in us,
nor can it be found in us. Now in one
of those places, we are said by the <hi>Law,</hi>
to be dead to the Law; and in the other,
by the <hi>Body</hi> of Christ. By the Law it
self, we are said to be dead to the Law,
as it maketh us to despair of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
by that Covenant: By the Body of
Christ, (that is, by the crucified Body,
or Death of Christ); so we are dead to
the Law, as we are invited to a better
Hope, or Covenant, which Christ hath
established by bearing our Sins on his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64994:73"/>
on the Tree, or enduring the Curse of
the Law for us: Be it by the one, or the
other, or both; none will value the Grace
of Christ till they be dead to the Law.
Men will shift, as long as they can patch up
a sorry Righteousness of their own, mingle
Covenants, turn one into another, make
one of both, chop, change, mangle, and
cut short the Law of God; do any
thing, rather than come upon their Knees,
and beg Terms of Grace in a serious and
broken-hearted manner. None can par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of Christ, but those that have their
legal Confidence mortified; who are first
driven, then drawn to him. None but
they who are convinced of Sin, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ly to
Christ for Righteousness; none but they
who are left obnoxious to Wrath, and
the Curse, prize his delivering us from
Wrath to come; none but those who are
made sensible of their impotency, will
seek after his Renewing Grace: But will
still keep to their base shifts, mingling and
blending Covenants; resting in a little
Superficial Righteousness, or half-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works, or mingling a little Grace
with it; are not brought in an humble,
penitent, and broken-hearted manner,
to sue out their Pardon in the Name of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:64994:73"/>
Christ; and so regularly to pass from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
to Covenant.</p>
                  <p>2. The Superficial Righteousness doth
not only keep Men from Christ, but set
them against Christ, his Way, his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and true Interest in the World:
These were Dogs, evil Workers, to whom
the Apostle opposeth the true Christians;
usually they that are for the Form, oppose
the Power. Gal. 4. 29. <hi>He that was born
after the Flesh, persecuted him that was born
after the Spirit.</hi> They that have but the
Form and Shadow of Godliness, no more
than the Power of Nature carrieth them
unto, will persecute those that have the
Reality and Truth, that is, the renewing
and reconciling Grace of Jesus Christ:
partly, because the true Spiritual Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers,
by their serious Godliness, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
and condemn those that lazily rest
in an empty Form; and therefore they
cannot endure them. At the bottom of
their Hearts, they have an enmity and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
against God, and vent it on his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
1 John 3. 12. <hi>Not as</hi> Cain, <hi>who was
of that wicked One, and slew his Brother:
And wherefore slew he him? Because his own
Works were Evil, and his Brother's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
Partly, Because there is in them a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64994:74"/>
Spirit of Envy and Emulation: Both are
Rivals for the Favour of God: The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Worshippers take the right way,
and the Formalists the wrong way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it: The first are received, the latter
rejected: And they being at such great
pains and costs in their wrong way, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure that any should be preferred
before them; witness <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel.</hi> Where
carnal Confidence is, there is bitterness of
Spirit against sincerity.</p>
                  <p>3. Because they have so much to do
with God: They that look to Men, may
rest in an outward appearance; but one
whose Business lieth mainly with God,
must look to the frame of his Heart, that
it be right set towards Holiness. Now this
is the course of a thorow Christian: 'Tis
God's Wrath that he feareth, God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
that is his Life and Happiness;
God's Presence, into which he often
cometh; God's Mercy, from whom he
expecteth his Reward, and with God he
hopeth to live for ever. Now bare Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals
ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of no account or worth with
God. John 4. 24. <hi>God is a Spirit, and
they that worship him, must worship him in
Spirit, and in Truth.</hi> 1 Sam. 16. 7. <hi>But
the Lord said unto</hi> Samuel, <hi>Look not on
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64994:74"/>
his Counten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nce, or on the heighth of his
Stature, because I have refused him; for the
Lord seeth not as Man seeth, for Man look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
on the outward Appearance, but the Lord
looketh on the Heart.</hi> Prov. 16. 2. <hi>All the
ways of a Man are clean in his own Eyes,
but the Lord weigheth the Spirit.</hi> Men judg
after the outward Appearance, but God
weigheth the Spirits.</p>
                  <p>4. Because of the Nature of Gospel-Worship;
which is simple, spiritual, and
substantial; therefore called <hi>Spirit</hi> often
in opposition to the Ceremonies of the
Law; and the ministration of the Spirit
unto Life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8. The Law is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Letter,</hi> and the Gospel <hi>Spirit.</hi> Now
for a Christian to turn the Ordinances of
Christ into Flesh, which were appointed
to be the Ministration of the Spirit, this is
to alter the nature of Things, and turn
the Gospel, by which is all our Claim and
Hope, into a dead Letter.</p>
                  <p>5. This Confidence should not be che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
by a Christian, because it can bring
no solid Peace to the Conscience, for the
present External Justificiaries are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
the Man that kept all these things
from his youth, saith, <hi>What lack I yet?
Mat.</hi> 19. 20. He asketh as a Man unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64994:75"/>
for our Bondage doth not wear
off with External Duties, but is increased
rather till we are justified in the Name of
Christ, and sanctified by his Spirit. But
suppose it satisfieth blind Conscience for
the present, yet afterwards, Men whose
Hearts are not sound in God's Statutes,
fall into sad Complaints, and are involved
in a Maze and Labyrinth of Doubts and
Troubles, whence they know not how to
extricate themselves: They have so much
sense of Religion, as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to understand their
Duty, and yet are so little brought under
the Power of it, as not to be able to make
out their claim. But if this be not the
case of all; when the hour of death
cometh, we shall find all is but froth,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 56. If we have not minded the
Redeemer's Grace, his whole Grace, the
Imputation of his Righteousness, and the
Regeneration of his Spirit, and lived in
obedience to his sanctifying Motions;
Then we shall be filled with horror and
amazement.</p>
                  <p>The, 1. Use is Caution: Take heed of
having Confidence in the Flesh, of placing
Religion, and valuing your Interest in
God by External Observances; but look
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64994:75"/>
to this, That your Hearts be upright with
God in the New Covenant. To this
end,</p>
                  <p>(1.) Take heed of a false Happiness;
The Wisdom of the Flesh, which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
to us, doth incline us to it, <hi>Iames</hi> 3.
15. doth only prompt us to Pleasure, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
and Honour: We set our Hearts on
vain Delights, and are wholly carried to
them, value our Happiness by them:
Whilst we indulge this sensual Inclination,
the Soul careth not for God, other things
are set up instead of God. The Belly is God,
<hi>Phil. 3. 10. Whose God is their Belly.</hi> Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
is their God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 24. And Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and worldly Greatness, is another
Idol which Men set up, while they value
the praise of Men, more than the praise
of God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 42. Carnal Self-love
maketh Idols, and sets up other Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of the True God: Now therefore
make it your first Work to return to God
as your Rightful Lord, and Chief Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as your Soveraign Lord. If you
make it your business and purpose to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God in the Spirit, you will rejoice in
Christ, and have no Confidence in the
Flesh. Spiritual Worship convinceth us
of Defects, and you will see a need of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64994:76"/>
Christ's renewing and reconciling Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Our Treasure and Happiness is our God.
Now therefore do you value your Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
by the Favour of God, and not by
wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>icial Righteousness: For this is
plain Confidence in the Flesh. This maketh
you sensless and ignorant of your Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and careless of the means of your

Conversion is more difficult. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <p>1. Outward Ordinances. To rest in
your attendance upon, and use of these.
Consider how displeased God was with
those that submitted to Sacraments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64994:76"/>
Reformation; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
<hi>With many of them God was not well-pleased,
but they were overthrown in the Wilderness;</hi>
Spiritual Meat, and Spiritual Drink, could
not keep them from Destruction; when
they murmured, when they fell from
Christ to Idolatry, when they lusted after
Quails, when they tempted Christ; And
will he be more favourable to you? Oh!
rest not then in the outward use of the
Ordinances of Christ; God may vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe
you this Favour, and yet not be well-pleased
with you. Many that have eaten
and drunk in his Presence, yet are finally
rejected for their sins, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 26. Many
prize the Seal, yet tear the Bond; that is,
break the Covenant, yet seem to value the
Seal of the Covenant, that they may have
Confidence in the Flesh, in the bare ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Performance.</p>
                  <p>2. Partial Morality: Those that live
fairly, and plausibly, but want the true
Principle, the Spirit of Christ; the true
Rule, the Word of God; the true End,
the Glory of God: that are in with one
Duty, and out with another; fail in their
Duties to God or Men: Are much in
Worship, but defective in common Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness:
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64994:77"/>
Love Friends, but cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
Enemies: It may be they'l forgive
Wrongs, but make no Conscience of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Debts. Now there are two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
against these; these neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Law, nor the Gospel: Not the
Law, its Strictness, Purity, and Spiritual
Exactness: Nor the Gospel, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
a Remedy only to the Penitent;
those who are deeply affected with the
pollution of their Natures, the Sins of
their Lives, and the Consequent Misery.
But those that are puft up with a vain
conceit of the goodness of their Estate,
without any brokenness of Heart,</p>
                  <p>1. They are injurious to the Law: As
they curtail it, and reduce it to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Work. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 20. Ye that desire
to be under the Law, hear what the Law
saith; if you will stand to that Covenant,
Do you know what it is? <hi>The Duty is
impossible.</hi> Rom. 8. 3. <hi>The Penalty is into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable:</hi>
For <hi>the Law worketh Wrath;</hi> and
'tis a Law of Sin and Death to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Creation: Rom. 8. 2. <hi>The Curse is very
dreadful and terrible.</hi> Nothing more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
to the Law, than this partial Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
The Law well understood,
would humble them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:64994:77"/>2. This resting in a partial external
Righteousness, is also opposite to the
Gospel, which inviteth us in a broken-hearted
manner to accept Christ. He
came to call Sinners, not those who are
Righteous in their own eyes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 13.
'Tis a Remedy for lost Sinners, not for
them that need no Repentance. <hi>Luke 15.
7. I say unto you, That likewise Ioy shall
be in Heaven over one Sinner that repenteth,
more than over ninety and nine just Persons
that need no repentance.</hi> Nothing is more
opposite to the Gospel, than this Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the Flesh. The Woman that
was a Sinner, was preferred before <hi>Simon</hi>
a Pharisee, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 44. And the Self-condemning
Publican, before the Self-justifying
Pharisee, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 13. The
Penitent Adulteress, before her Accusers,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 7. The most despised Sinners,
repenting, and believing in Christ, find
more Grace and Place with him, than
those that satisfy themselves with some
External Conformities.</p>
                  <p>A second <hi>Vse</hi> is by way of Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Are you of this Temper, that you
have no Confidence in the Flesh?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:64994:78"/>If you are,</p>
                  <p>1. You are still kept humble, and
thankful: Humble, with a sense of Sin,
and deserved Wrath; confessing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
your Sins, and glorying in Christ
only, you are kept vile in your own
Eyes, and in an humble admiration of
Grace; Luke 7. 47. <hi>Wherefore I say unto
you, Her Sins which are many are forgiven
her, for she loved much,</hi> &amp;c. She loved
much, because much was forgiven. When
God is pacified, yet you loath your
selves. Ezek. 16. 63. <hi>That thou mayest
remember, and be confounded, and never
open thy Mouth any more, because of thy
shame, when I am pacified towards thee,
for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord
God.</hi> And you ascribe all to the Mercy
of God, and the Merit of Christ; Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
God for him, and imploring Pardon
for your best Duties; our Righteousness
being but as filthy Rags.</p>
                  <p>2. A partial outside Obedience will not
satisfy you. An Heart that findeth rest in
empty formal Services, certainly places
Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>idence in the Flesh. They neither
look after the change of their Natures,
nor their Reconciliation with God by
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64994:78"/>
Christ. They challenge God; <hi>Isa. 58. 3.
Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou
seest not? Wherefore have we afflicted our
Soul, and thou takest no knowledg?</hi> And,
Luke 18. 12. <hi>I fast twice in the week, and
I give tithe of all that I possess.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Thankfulness, or Gratitude, sets
you awork for God, rather than a Legal
Conscience. Duties are performed as a
Thank-Offering, rather than a Sin-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
out of Love to God, rather than
Fear.</p>

ye be otherwise minded, God shall

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THese words are inferred out of the
foregoing Context, as the illative
Particle <hi>[therefore]</hi> sheweth.</p>
                  <p>In the words are two things:</p>
                  <p>1. His Exhortation to the strong and
grown Christian, <hi>Let us therefore, as many
as be perfect, be thus minded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:64994:80"/>2. His Condescension to the Weak;
And if in any thing ye be otherwise minded,
God shall reveal even this unto you.</p>
                  <p>In the former Branch we have,</p>
                  <p>1. The Term by which the strong
Christian is expressed, <hi>As many as be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</hi>
He had said before of himself, that
he was not yet perfect, <hi>vers.</hi> 12. Yet
now, he supposeth it both of himself and
others, <hi>Let us therefore, as many as be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
Therefore Perfection must be taken
in a limited sense, to avoid the seeming
Contradiction.</p>
                  <p>2. The Advice or Counsel given, <hi>be
thus minded;</hi> What is that? <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>think the same thing with me:</hi> What that
is, must be known by the foregoing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text,
and may be gathered from the <hi>third</hi>
Verse, he had spoken of some false
Teachers and judaizing Brethren, who
gave out themselves to be Patrons, and
Defenders of the Circumcision, and other
Ceremonies of the Law, as if these thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
did commend them to God: Now the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
reproveth them, and saith they were
not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Circumcision, but

                     </gap>, <hi>the Concision,</hi> Destroyers and
Renders of the Church, not the true
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64994:80"/>
People of God, who were sometimes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Term <hi>Circumcision:</hi> they are
the Concision, the Cutters and Dividers
of the Church; but we are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
the true Circumcision, <hi>who serve God in
the Spirit, and rejoice in Christ Iesus, and
have no confidence in the Flesh:</hi> That is,
who have no confidence in any superficial
Righteousness, but seek our Justification
before God, and the renovation of our
Natures from Christ alone; and serve
God, by exercising this Grace, in Faith,
Love, and Hope; or who seek to Christ
alone, for his renewing and reconciling
Grace, that we may serve God in a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Manner, and so at length attain the
promised Glory. Now this he proveth
by his own Instance, who had as much
cause to glory in the Flesh, as any of
them, but suffered the loss of all things,
and counted all things wherein they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and he might have gloried, but loss
and dung, that he might obtain this Grace
from Christ Jesus; and at length, after a
diligent self-denying course of Service
and Obedience, be brought home to God.
Now, saith he, <hi>As many as be perfect,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, mind this, take care of this,
and do you, with the loss of all things,
press to this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:64994:81"/>3. His Condescension to the Weak, who
were not satisfied with the abrogation of
the Ceremonies of the Law, though they
had imbraced other Parts and Points of
Christianity; <hi>And if in any thing ye be
otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this
to you.</hi> Here,</p>
                  <p>1. Something is supposed, that they
should not be cut off from the rest of
Christians, either by the harsh Censures,
or rigorous dealing of the Strong, or the
pertinacious obstinacy of the Weak. The
Perfect, that have the Truth of their side,
must not condemn others; nor the Weak
must not condemn and censure them.</p>
                  <p>2. Something expressed: Or the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of this mutual Condescension and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance;
if they be sincere, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
God will at length shew them the
Truth.</p>
                  <p>I begin with his Counsel to the Strong
and Grown Christian; and there I shall
speak, first of the <hi>Term</hi> by which they
are expressed; <hi>Let as many of us as be
perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> That there is a kind of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
attainable in this Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:64994:81"/>
I shall, first, explain the Point by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Distinctions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Prove that all Christians
should endeavour to be perfect.</p>
                  <p>For the first: There is a double Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
<hi>Perfectio termini &amp; praemii: &amp;
perfectio viae seu cognitionis, &amp; sanctitatis.</hi>
A Perfection of the Reward, and a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Grace.</p>
                  <p>1. Of the Reward which the Saints
shall have in Heaven, where they are
freed from all sinful Weakness: 1 Cor.
13. 10. <hi>When that which is perfect shall
come, then that which is in part shall be
done away.</hi> In Heaven there is perfect
Felicity, and exact Holiness; then the
Saints are glorious Saints indeed, when
they have neither spot, nor wrinkle, nor
blemish, nor any such thing, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 27.
When <hi>presented faultless before the presence
of his Glory,</hi> Jude 24. Now this we have
not in the World; but because this we
expect in the other World, we are to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
after the highest perfection in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
here, because allowed Imperfection is
a disesteem of Blessedness. Do we count
Immaculate Purity and Perfection in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64994:82"/>
to be our Blessedness hereafter?
and shall we shun it, and fly from it, or
at least neglect it, as if it were our Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
now? No surely! <hi>he that hath this
hope in him, purifieth himself, as Christ is
pure,</hi> 1 John 3. 3. That looketh not for
a Turkish Paradise, but a Sinless Estate,
will endeavour it now, get as much as he
can of it now. When you cease to grow
in Holiness, you cease to go on any farther
to Salvation; you seem to be out of love
with Heaven and Blessedness, when your
Desires and Endeavours are slaked.</p>
                  <p>2. The Perfection of Grace and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is such, as the Saints may attain unto
in this Life. Col. 4. 12. <hi>That ye may stand
perfect and compleat in all the Will of God.</hi>
So we are perfect, when we want none
of those things which are necessary to
Salvation, when we study to avoid all
known Sin, and address our selves to the
practice of all known Duty, serving God
universally and intirely.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is Perfection <hi>Legal,</hi> and
<hi>Evangelical:</hi> Legal, is unsinning Obedience;
Evangelical, is sincere Obedience; the
<hi>one</hi> is, where there is no Sin; the <hi>other</hi>
no Guile, no allowed Guile. The <hi>one</hi>
standeth in an exact conformity to God's
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64994:82"/>
Law; <hi>the other,</hi> in a sincere endeavour to
fulfil it; the <hi>one</hi> will endure the Ballance,
the <hi>other</hi> can only endure the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</p>
                  <p>1. The legal Perfection is described,
Gal. 3. 10. <hi>Cursed is every one that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not in all the words of this Law to do
them.</hi> A personal, perpetual perfect O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience!
It supposeth a Man innocent, it
requireth that he should continue so; for
the least Offence, according to that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
layeth us open to a Curse: As
the Angels for one Sin once committed,
were turned out of Heaven, and <hi>Adam</hi>
out of Paradise. The omitting of ought we
are to perform, the committing ought we
are forbidden, yea the least warping, as
well as swerving, by an obliquity of Heart
and Spirit, maketh us guilty before God.
Now this is become impossible, through
the weakness of our Flesh. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3.
Man is fallen already, and hath mixed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
in him, and cannot be thus exact
with God.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Evangelical:</hi> When the Heart is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
with God, fixedly bent and set to please
him in all things. 2 Kings 20. 3. <hi>Remember
Lord, I have walked before thee in Truth, and
with a perfect Heart.</hi> This may be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64994:83"/>
in subordination to Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
this Perfection is consistent with
Weakness. 2 Chron. 15. 17. <hi>Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
the Heart of</hi> Asa <hi>was perfect all his
days.</hi> And yet he is taxed with several
Infirmities: This Perfection all must have;
1 Chron. 28. 9. <hi>And thou,</hi> Solomon <hi>my
Son, know thou the God of thy Father, and
serve him with a perfect Heart, and a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Mind.</hi> What is done for God, as it
must be done <hi>willingly, readily,</hi> not by
constraint, but the native Inclination of
the Soul; so <hi>perfectly,</hi> that is, with all
exactness possible. As some may do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things which are good, but their
Hearts are not perfect with God: 2 <hi>Chron.
25. 2. He did that which is right in the sight
of the Lord, but not with a perfect Heart.</hi>
Not a sincere bent of Soul towards God
alone, when the Heart is divided between
God and other things, <hi>Hosea 10. 2. Their
Heart is divided.</hi> Jam. 1. 8. <hi>A double-minded
Man is unstable in all his ways.</hi> An
Heart against an Heart; In point of Faith,
between God and other Confidences; in
point of Love, between God and the
Vanities of the World, and God's Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
is not chief, nor do we love him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things: In point of Obedience,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64994:83"/>
between pleasing God, and pleasing Men,
and pleasing God and our own vain
Fancies and Appetites, honouring God,
and promoting our Worldly Ends, you
set up a Rival and Partner with God.
Now this Perfection we must have, or else
not in a state of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>3. There is a Perfection Absolute and
Comparative.</p>
                  <p>1. That is absolutely perfect, to which
nothing is wanting: This is in our Lord
Christ, who had the Spirit without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
this is in our Rule, but not in them
that follow the Rule; Psal. 18. 30. <hi>As
for God, his way is perfect.</hi> But that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Perfection is not in any of the
Saints here upon Earth, I prove by these
Arguments.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Where there are many Relicks of
Flesh, or carnal Nature left, there a Man
cannot be absolutely perfect; but so 'tis
with all the Godly, there is a double war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-working
Principle in them; <hi>Gal. 5.
17. For the Flesh lusteth against the Spirit,
and the Spirit against the Flesh, and these
are contrary the one to the other; so that ye
cannot do the things that ye would.</hi> And 'tis
actually confirmed in <hi>Paul,</hi> witness his
Groans, <hi>Rom. 7. 24. Oh wretched Man
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:64994:84"/>
that I am, who shall deliver me from the
Body of this Death!</hi> Mark there, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
speaketh of himself, not of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
of himself, in his present renewed
Estate, not of his past and unconverted
Estate, when a Pharisee. His past Estate
he had spoken of, <hi>vers. 9. Sin revived,
and I died;</hi> but, <hi>vers. 14. I am Carnal:</hi>
and <hi>vers. 15. That which I do, I allow not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
and <hi>vers. 18. How to perform that which is
good, I find not.</hi> Many things there said,
cannot agree to a Carnal Man: As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
not allowing Sin, <hi>vers. 15. Hating
Sin</hi> in the same Verse. <hi>What I hate, that
do I, so delight in the Law of God,</hi> vers.
22. Again, there is a double Man distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished,
<hi>vers. 17. It is no more I, but sin
that dwelleth in me.</hi> Again, he distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth
between Him and his Flesh, <hi>vers.</hi>
18. So between an outward and inward
Man, <hi>vers.</hi> 22, 23. Lastly, He giveth
thanks for deliverance by Christ, all which
are competent only to the <hi>Regenera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e.</hi>
Now these things being so, surely God's
best Servants are not absolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                  <p>(2.) <hi>There are none but sometimes sin.
1 Kings</hi> 8. 46. For there is no Man that
sinneth not. <hi>And,</hi> Eccles. 7. 20. There is
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64994:84"/>
not a just Man upon Earth, that doth good,
and sinneth not. <hi>And,</hi> Iames 3. 2. In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things we offend all. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 8. If we
say we have no Sin, we deceive our selves,
and the Truth is not in us. <hi>Therefore no
Man so perfect, as to be without all
Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(3.) There is none but need the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God, and ought to pray for this
Mercy for the Pardon of their daily Sins,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 13. as we pray for daily Bread:
This <hi>Petition</hi> our Lord directeth us to put
up, not for the Sins of others, but our
own. Now these Arguments prove that
no Man hath a Righteousness that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
without Defects: The best of God's
Children have innumerable Frailties which
may humble them, and which should be
seriously laid to Heart, and watched over,
every step of our way to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>2. There is a comparative Perfection:
And that is Two-fold.</p>
                  <p>1. When those who live under the Law
of Christianity, are compared with other
Institutions.</p>
                  <p>2. When the Professors of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
are compared among themselves.</p>
                  <p>1. When the Professors of Christianity
are compared with those that live under
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64994:85"/>
other Institutions. They that submit to
Christ's Terms, are said to be perfect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christianity it self is a Perfection.
For Instance, take that one place, (and
the rather, that I may wrest it out of the
Hands of the Papists, who distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Evangelical Precepts of necessary
Duty, and Counsels of Perfection to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
Monkery and voluntary Poverty, as
a more perfect state of Life than that
which the common sort of Christians live.)
Their most colourable place is, <hi>Mat. 19.
21. Iesus said unto him, If thou wilt be
perfect, go sell all that thou hast, and give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
the poor, and thou shalt have Treasure in
Heaven, and come and follow me.</hi> Is not
this a Counsel of Perfection? doth not
Christ call it so? Or, is every one bound
to give all his Goods to the Poor, and
turn Monks or Anchorites? No, the
meaning of the word, <hi>If thou wilt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
is no more but this; if thou wilt as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
to that higher pitch and rule of
living, to which I come to raise Men, if
thou wilt be a Christian. The Perfection
here spoken of, is Christianity it self, not
an Heroick eminent degree of it: And
the Condition here required, is Matter of
Command, not Counsel, only such as if
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64994:85"/>
we will not submit to, we are not Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
for a Man that would have the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
of the Gospel, he must submit to
the Duties of the Gospel, or the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
required by Christ, that is, to be a
perfect thorow Christian. You will say,
Must we sell all, and give to the Poor, in
contemplation of the Heavenly Reward?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Every Man is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
Goods, Land, and Life, as God shall
direct, and part with all the Wealth in
the World whensoever it is required of
him. Now it may be required of us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
or by consequence: directly, by
an express Command, such as this young
Man had from Christ. And actually, to sell
our Estates, and give to the Poor, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth
none, unless we have such alike
Command from Christ himself, as this
young rich Man had: By Consequence,
when we cannot obey any particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of Christ, without danger of being
undone by it. And so it obligeth all Christ's
Disciples to part with all, rather than to
break with Christ: for no Man is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
unless he selleth all for the Pearl of
Price, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 46. And our Lord tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
us, that he that loveth any thing
more than him, is not worthy of him,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64994:86"/>
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 37. that is, is no Christian; so
that if it be impossible to preserve our
Fidelity and Obedience, without parting
with our Wealth, we must impartially
perform it, though it be with loss of
Estate and Life it self; and if we do not
resolve and undertake to do so, we are
no Christians, and cannot be saved. In
Baptism, we vow to forsake the World,
and follow Christ, when the World
cometh in competition with him; if in
a time of trial we do not perform it, we
forfeit the Privileges of Christianity, and
all title to Blessedness. Therefore this
Perfection is necessary for all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
you esteem, prefer, chuse Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, resolving, what-ever it cost you
to be faithful to him; 'tis not an high and
arbitrary Point in Christianity, but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Duty. You will say, What can
the strongest Christian do more, than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

all, than part with all? Answer, They
can do it with far greater love, readiness
and joy, than the weak Christian can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
The difference between Christians is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
in the thing done, but the manner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<hi>Well then,</hi> this is to be perfect, thus must
you all be perfect, for this Perfection is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
constitutive of sincerity, you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
not true Christians without it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:64994:86"/>2. When compared with others of the
same Profession. Believers are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
into Perfect and Imperfect. Tho'
none can attain to absolute Perfection of
Holiness, yet there are several degrees of
Grace, and diversities of growth among
Christians, and the strong are said to be
perfect in comparison of those weak Ones
who are raw in Knowledg, or feeble and
impotent in the resistance of Sin. Thus
the Perfect are opposed to the Babes in
Christ; as when he had spoken of our
growing into a perfect Man in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
he presently addeth, <hi>That henceforth
we be no more Children,</hi> Ephes. 4. 13, 14.
And elsewhere, when he had spoken of
the <hi>Perfect,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 6. who are skilful
in spiritual Things, he presently opposeth
to them, <hi>the Babes in Christ,</hi> Chap. 3. 1.
The same you may observe in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 13,
14. <hi>He that useth Milk, is unskilful in the
Word of Righteousness, for he is a Babe. But
strong Meat belongeth to them that are of full
age, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, perfect,</hi> as in the Margin. See also
1 <hi>Cor. 14. 20. Brethren, be not Children in
understanding: howbeit, in Malice be ye Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
but in Vnderstanding be Men, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
or of ripe Age. These, and many
other places, shew the Notion of <hi>perfect;</hi>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:64994:87"/>
'tis not absolutely taken, but comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
Those who well and throughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
Christian Doctrine, and are ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated
to a course of Godliness, and
have a confirmed Faith and Love to God,
and this in Opposition to Novices, and
unexperienced Christians newly entred
into Christ's School: Now thus we must
be perfect, not always Children. 'Tis a
monstrous Thing, after many Years
growth to be a Babe still, and an Infant
still. This sense is of chief regard here.</p>
                  <p>3. There is a Perfection of Parts, and
a Perfection of Degrees; that's Growth.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Perfection of Parts is, when we have
all things that belong to a sincere Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
or to a state of Salvation: As living
Creatures are perfect as soon as they are
brought forth, for they have all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to that Creature, 'tis not maimed
or defective in any part; thus an Infant is
perfect the first day of his Birth, as well
as a Man of riper Age. Thus a Christian
must have the perfection of Integrity, all
the parts which belong to a New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
Grace to enlighten the Mind, bend
and incline the Heart to God, govern the
Affections, rule the Appetite; one Grace
added to another, that the Christian may
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64994:87"/>
be intire and perfect, and in no point
lacking, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 4. What is defective in
parts, cannot be supplied by any after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growth.
A Christian cannot be perfect
in Degrees, unless he be perfect in parts;
leave out one necessary Grace, and the
new Creature is maimed; some leave out
Temperance, others Patience, others
Love, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>(2.) There is a Perfection of Degrees,
that is, when a thing is absolute and
compleat, and to which nothing is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and hath attained its <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
pitch; so we are only perfect in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
Heb. 12. 23. <hi>The Spirits of just Men
made perfect.</hi> Those Spirits who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathed
and divested of the Body, in
their mortal Life only they were upright,
but in their Heavenly Life perfect: Here
they walked with God, and endeavoured
an Universal Obedience to him, and so
made capable, but now live with God,
and are admitted into a nearer Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with him than we Mortals are; they
are freed from all Sin and Temptation,
they are beyond growth: Corn doth not
grow in the Garner, but in the Field
Well then, though we be not perfect in
Degrees, yet we must all be perfect as to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64994:88"/>
parts, we must intirely resign our selves
to God's use, without allowing any part
or corner of our Hearts to be possessed by
any other.</p>
                  <p>4. Perfection is to be considered with
respect, 1. to our Growth, or, 2. our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation:
Here 'tis only in <hi>sieri,</hi> there in
<hi>facto esse.</hi> Things are said to be done, when
they are begun to be done, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17.
And so they are said to be perfect, who
are in the way of Perfection; he that is,
in his growing Estate, increasing more
unto Grace and Righteousness, 2 <hi>Cor. 3.
18. Beholding as in a Glass the Glory of
the Lord, are changed into the same Image.</hi>
2 Cor. 4. 16. <hi>Though the outward Man pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
yet the inward Man is renewed day by
day.</hi> They do seriously set upon the
Work. Thus Perfection is taken;</p>
                  <p>(1.) As to Means: The Ministry was
appointed for <hi>the perfecting of the Saints,
Ephes.</hi> 4. 12. That they may be more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,
and more sanctified, more
brought to the Knowledg of God, and
Obedience of his Will. There are Mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
appointed by God for the perfecting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
Grace, as well as the first working of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
in us; 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 10. That <hi>I may perfect
what is lacking to your Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:64994:88"/>(2.) As to the improvement of Means:
2 Cor. 7. 1. <hi>Perfecting Holiness in the Fear
of God,</hi> making progress in the Way of
Grace towards Perfection, when the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
is more increased: 2 Pet. 1. 8. <hi>For if
these things be in you, and abound, they
make you that ye shall neither be barren nor
unfruitful in the Knowledg of Christ.</hi> And
Christian practice is more uniform. 1 <hi>Thess.
4. 1. That as ye have received of us how ye
ought to walk, and please God, so that ye
would abound more and more.</hi> 'Tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to have Grace, but we must grow
in Grace: Progress is always necessary,
though exact Perfection be not attained:
So that then the Heart is perfect with
God, when you make it not a sleight pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
only, but your constant endeavour
to come up to your Pattern and Rule, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
striving against Sin, and aiming
at an higher degree of Holiness.</p>
                  <p>2. Consummate: When after all the
hazards of the present Life, when at length
we shall be presented to Christ, and by
Christ to God: Presented to Christ; <hi>Col.
1. 28. That we may present every Man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in Christ Iesus:</hi> That is, fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,
according to that Holiness required
and exemplified by Christ: And by Christ
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64994:89"/>
to God; Col. 1. 22. <hi>To present you holy,
and unblameable, and irreproveable in his
sight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I now come to the Reasons.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; The Reasons why we must
be perfect, that is, not only sincere, having
all parts of a Christian, but endeavour
after the highest Perfection; and for the
present, want nothing conducible nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation.</p>
                  <p>1. We have a perfect God; <hi>Matth. 5.
48. Be ye perfect, as your Heavenly Father
is perfect.</hi> God's Perfection is our Copy,
and that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and we are required to
imitate him; and therefore we must not
set Bounds to our Holiness, and say, <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rto
shalt thou come, and no farther;</hi>
when we are come never so far, yet this is
not like God. The force of this Rule is
not taken off, because 'tis limited to one
Perfection in the Divine Nature in the
Evangelist <hi>Luke;</hi> for he readeth, instead
of being perfect as your Heavenly Father
is perfect, <hi>Be ye merciful, as your Heavenly
Father is merciful,</hi> Luke 6. 36. that is a
special way of Christian Perfection; but
God's Children must aim at the Perfection
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64994:89"/>
of all Vertues. Not only love to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
as Mercy is one of the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
which we ought to imitate, so is
Holiness, Veracity, and Wisdom, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
1. 15, 16. Surely this direction was given
in the Gospel to some purpose, or not:
if not, then Christ spoke words in vain;
if to some purpose, we are obliged to
Perfection: though we cannot fully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it in this life, we must still aim at
more, and come more near to it. And
having God for our Patern, we should
always set him before our Eyes, as he is
represented to us in his Word, and his
Son Jesus Christ, the express Image of his
Person, to be imitated by us.</p>
                  <p>2. We have a perfect Rule; <hi>Psalm. 19.
7. The Law of God is perfect.</hi> And, 2 <hi>Tim.
3. 17. The Word of God is able to make the
Man of God perfect, throughly furnished to
every good Work.</hi> The strictness of the
Law as a Rule, is adopted into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace, into the very frame and
constitution of it, and so far bindeth, as
to allow no Weaknesses and Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but that we must still bewail Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and strive after the utmost confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to it in all things. As we have a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Pattern, so we have a Law still, that
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:64994:90"/>
is the perfect Rule of all Righteousness,
and therefore we should endeavour to
conform to it more and more.</p>
                  <p>3. We have a perfect Redeemer:
Col. 2. 10. <hi>Ye are compleat in him.</hi> We
have all things from him, and in him, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to Salvation. In our selves we are
empty, destitute of every thing which
might commend us to God, but there is a
fulness in Christ to be communicated to
all, who sensible of their own emptiness,
do seriously apply themselves to him; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Wisdom, a perfect Righteousness,
perfect Sanctification, and supplies for ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
perfect Glory and Blessedness. He begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
by his Spirit to renew our Natures;
and this Grace is still of the growing
Hand, till all be crowned in Glory;
there is a compleat Fulness in our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
                  <p>4. There is a perfect Reward, or a
perfect state of Glory, in which there is
nothing wanting, either to Holiness or
Happiness. The Scripture describeth it
by our growing up into a perfect Man in
Christ Jesus, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 13. We have our
Infancy at our first Conversion, when lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to childish Ignorance, and many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities:
we have our youth and growing
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64994:90"/>
Age, when making Progress in the way
of Grace towards Perfection.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, We have our perfect manly
Age, when we are come to our full pitch,
when Grace is fully perfected in Glory. In
Scripture, there is nothing said of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and declining time of old Age. Oh!
blessed will that time be, when we shall
be holy and undefiled, above the reach
of Temptations; when Believers receive
all immediatly from the Fountain of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and are filled with the fulness of
all Perfections; And shall we that have
such Hopes, be lazy and negligent? No,
we must press towards the Mark, if we
expect it as our Felicity, we must prize it,
and seek after it, and get more of it eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Is to press and exhort you, to
labour after Christian Perfection.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Motives.</hi> What you lost in <hi>Adam,</hi>
must be recovered in Christ, or else you
dishonour your Redeemer. Now we lost
in <hi>Adam</hi> Innocency and perfect Holiness,
therefore you must seek to recover it by
Christ; for certainly Christ is more able
to save, than <hi>Adam</hi> to destroy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.
17. The abundance of Grace, and the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:64994:91"/>
Gift of Righteousness, came by Jesus
Christ. 'Tis true, Christ doth his Work
by Degrees; but if we mind it not, and
lazily expect that he should make us
perfect, how will it ever be? for God
will not save us without us; and as far as
we hope for any thing, we must endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
after it, for Christian Hope is not
a devout Sloth, but an incouragement to
Diligence.</p>
                  <p>2. We pray for Perfection, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must endeavour after it, otherwise
our Prayers are a Mockery. We pray,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 8. and 1 <hi>Thess. 5. 23. The God of
Peace sanctify you throughout, even your
whole Body, Soul, and Spirit.</hi> We pray
for compleat Sanctification, in hope to
obtain it: Prayer is not for God's sake,
but ours; a solemn binding our selves to
use the means, that we may obtain the
Blessings that we ask.</p>
                  <p>3. In our making Covenant, we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to do the whole Will of God: now
where there is a Purpose, there must be
an Endeavour, and a Progress, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
'tis not made with a true heart, <hi>Heb.</hi>
10. 22. A Man may purpose Duty in a
Pang, which afterward he retracts in his
Conversation and Practice; he may wish
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64994:91"/>
for Perfection, like it in the general, not
considering it as exclusive of his beloved
Lusts, but there he will be excused. Yea,
he may sincerely purpose it, yet be faint
and slack in his Endeavours. Therefore
we need to be exhorted continually to
be more earnest and diligent in Holiness,
to avoid <hi>all appearance of Evil,</hi> 1 Thess. 5.
22. Not to allow our selves in the omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any known Duty, <hi>Iames</hi> 4. 13.
or the commission of any known Sin,
though never so near and dear to us.
Psal. 18. 23. <hi>I was upright before thee; and
kept my self from mine Iniquity.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unless we comply with these Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and set our selves sincerely to do
the whole Will of God, the Challenge
will be brought against us, which was
brought against the Church of <hi>Sardis; I
have not found thy Works perfect before God,
Rev.</hi> 3. 2. Your Vows were good, but your
Practice is not answerable.</p>
                  <p>4. Consider the Comfort and Peace of
that Man who doth more and more press
towards Perfection: Psalm. 37. 37. <hi>Mark
the perfect Man, behold the Vpright; for
the End of that Man is Peace.</hi> They have
a sweet Life, and an happy Close, a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
passage through the World, and a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64994:92"/>
comfortable passage out of the World.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Means;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. See that the Work be begun, for
there must be converting Grace, before
there can be confirming Grace, Life before
there be Strength and Growth, as there
must be Fire before it can be blown up;
for what good will it do to blow a
dead Coal, to seek Strength before we
have Life? 'tis as if we should give Food
or Physick to a dead Man. The Secure
and Impenitent are not to be confirmed
and strengthned, but humbled and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
We must first chuse God for our
Portion, before we can be exhorted to
cleave to God, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 23. First, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of Sincerity, before the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Growth and Progress, the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and Degrees following the real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Grace in the Soul.</p>
                  <p>2. If you would be perfect, the radical
Graces must be strengthned, which are
Faith, Hope, and Love; strong Faith,
fervent Love, lively Hope. Such a Faith
as realizeth the unseen Glory, and giveth
such a deep sense of the World to come,
as that you are willing to venture all upon
the Hopes of it; such an Hope as sets the
Heart upon Glory to come, as present
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64994:92"/>
things do not greatly move us; such a Love
as levelleth all our Actions to God's Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and our eternal enjoyment of him,
<hi>Iude</hi> 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>3. Use the Means with all Seriousness
and good Conscience, these conduce to
perfect what is lacking to your Faith, to
root you, ground you in Love, confirm
you in Hope, that the Thoughts of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
may be more affecting and engaging.
Now the principal Means are, the Word,
and Sacraments, and Prayer.</p>
                  <p>(1.) In the Word you have Principles
of Faith, Obligations to Love, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of Hope; therefore 'tis said,
God buildeth us up by the Word of his
Grace, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 32.</p>
                  <p>(2.) The Sacraments strengthen Faith,
Hope, and Love; as Signs and Seals of the
Love of God, through Jesus Christ in the
new Covenant, that so our Consolation
may be more strong, they strengthen our
Faith and Hope; as a Bond or a Vow:
So they excite and engage our Love and
Obedience, we bind our selves to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new,
to pursue our everlasting Hopes,
whatever they cost us. Our great Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
are proneness to Evil, and backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64994:93"/>
to Good; we check the one, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
the other.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Prayer; for 'tis God that perfects
us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 10. he must be sought to, his
Blessing maketh the means effectual.</p>
                  <p>4. Think much and often of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Blessedness, which you expect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to promise; which will quicken
and excite you to more diligence. There
is a time coming, when the Mind shall be
filled with as much Light, and the Heart
with as much Love and Joy as the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of it is able to contain. There will
be,</p>
                  <p>1. A compleat Vision of God and
Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. No desire of the
Mind shall be unfilled or unsatisfied with
the Knowledg of God in Christ.</p>
                  <p>2. A compleat Possession and Fruition
of God: <hi>Here,</hi> we are in a waiting, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting,
longing Posture; but <hi>there</hi> is a
plenary Fruition; we are filled up with
all the Fulness of God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 19. and
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. God is all in all.</p>
                  <p>3. A compleat Similitude and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
in the Image of Christ, 1 <hi>Iohn
3. 2. Psal. 17. 15. Here</hi> Grace is mingled
with Corruption; we are like God by the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64994:93"/>
first Fruits of the Spirit, but unlike him
by the Remainders of Corruption; But
in Heaven we shall be wholly like him.
<hi>Here</hi> we resemble Christ, but we also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
<hi>Adam,</hi> yea, and often shew forth
more of <hi>Adam</hi> than Jesus: But <hi>there</hi> we
only shew forth the Holiness and Purity of
Christ; His Image shineth in us without
Spot and Blemish.</p>
                  <p>4. A compleat Delectation arising from
all the rest. The Vision, Fruition, and
Likeness of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 11. Those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
are full and perpetual: Our great
Business will be to love what we see, and
our great happiness to have what we love:
This is our never-failing Delight; we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into our Master's Joy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. and
1 <hi>Pet. 4. 13. That when his Glory shall be
revealed, ye may be glad with an exceeding
Ioy.</hi> The Lord hath reserved the fulness
of his People's Joy, until that time when
Sorrow will be no more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Are we perfect, that is, grown
Christians in the way to Perfection?</p>
                  <p>The Notes of it are;</p>
                  <p>1. When there is such a base esteem of
worldly Things, that our Affections are
weakned to them every day: One half of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64994:94"/>
Religion, is dying to the World, as the
other half is living to God, the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Self-love, and the strengthning and
increasing our Love to God: Self-love is
gratified by the Pleasures, Honours, and
Profits of the World; so love to God
aimeth at the enjoyment of God, when
we get above the Hopes and Fears of the
World, and the Delights of Sense; <hi>I am
crucified to the World,</hi> Gal. 6. 12. when
<hi>every thing is loss and dung for Christ's
sake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. When more unsatisfied with present
Degrees of Holiness, with a constant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to grow better: Our maimed
and defective Service, is a real trouble to
us: we bewail our Wants and Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;

serve God no better; you are still groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

but when you allow your selve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christianity. A true Christian desireth
the highest degree of Holiness, and to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

sit down contented with any low degree
of Grace; 'tis a trouble to him that he
knoweth and loveth God no more, and
serveth him no better; his smallest Sins
are a greater burden to him, than the
greatest bodily Wants and Sufferings, <hi>Rom.</hi>
7. 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>3. Such are more swayed by Love than
Fear: Weak Christians are most obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
when most in fear of Hell; but the
more we love the Lord our God with all
our Hearts, the more we advance towards
our final Estate. At first our Pride and
Sensuality beareth sway and rule in us, and
have no resistance, but now and then
some frightnings and uneffectual checks
from the fears of Hell, such they are not
converted yet. And if the sense of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
do more prevail upon us, yet our
Condition is more troublous than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable,
and all our business is, to escape
the everlasting Misery which we fear, and so
we may forsake the practice of those gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
Sins which breed our Fears, or perform
some Duties that may best fortify us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them; but this Religion is anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Fear alone, without the Love of
God, and Holiness, that's only prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to Religion, near the Kingdom of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64994:95"/>
God: But when really converted, we have
the Spirit of his Son inclining us to God
as a Father, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. But as yet the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Adoption produceth but weak Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
we differ little from a Servant;
'Tis <hi>perfect Love casteth out Fear,</hi> 1 John
4. 18. When the Soul loveth God, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
God, and is inclined to the Ways of
God, delighteth in them as they lead to
God; then we are in a better progress,
and more prepared for our final Estate:
His great Motive is Love, his great End
is perfect Love. For the present, he would
serve him better, because he delighteth in
his ways. <hi>O how I love thy Law!</hi> Psalm.
119. 97. and <hi>vers. 140. Thy Word is very
pure; therefore thy Servant loveth it.</hi> They
are willing and ready for God, these are
throughly setled in a Christian Course.</p>
                  <p>4. The grown Christian is more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
he seeth more of his Defects than
others do: Weak Christians are more lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be puffed up, than the wiser and
stronger; for the more Men increase in
Grace, whether Knowledg or Holiness,
the more they know their Emptiness, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortifiedness,
and manifold Sins and
Failings: The more they know of the
Jealousy of God's Holiness, of the Evil
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64994:95"/>
of Sin, of the Strictness of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
have a deeper sense of their Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
to God, and have more experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of their own slippery Hearts: Sin is
more a burden to them than ever they
see; they have more difficulties to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with, and all this keepeth them hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and low in their own Eyes. All this
is spoken to press you to look to this
growth and progress, which is our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
By the way, He that thinketh
he hath Grace enough to be saved, and
careth for no more, dealeth more niggard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with God than he would do in the
World; if a Man hath Bread enough to
keep him from starving, would he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent?
There is no Truth, where no care of
growth; if our Condition be safe, 'tis not
sure to us.</p>

in Opinion, all Lenity and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Forbearance should be used, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
things from coming to an open
Rupture.</p>
                  <p>So sweet and mild was the Discipline
in the Apostles days, that he would not
compel Men to do what-ever he or others
did conceive to be Good, or to forbear
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64994:97"/>
what they did conceive to be Evil, but
without force, leave them to God's Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Illumination.</p>
                  <p>Here let me shew you,</p>
                  <p>I. What Lenity and Forbearance should
be used.</p>
                  <p>II. The Reasons why Lenity and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
should be used.</p>
                  <p>I. What Lenity and Forbearance should
be used. Let us state it in these Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                  <p>1. There may be, and often are, Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of Opinion about lesser Things in
the Church: Partly, Because of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
degrees of Light. All Barks that
sail to Heaven, draw not alike depth of
Water. And partly, because of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of Corruption in all. Inordinate
Self-love is not in all alike broken and
mortified, and so their particular Interests
have an influence upon their Opinions.
And partly, because of the accidental Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
of Education and Converse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. When these Differences arise, we
should take care they come not to a Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and open Breach. This is the course
the Apostle taketh here, he doth not by
and by despair of the Dissenters, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64994:97"/>
them as Hereticks, but beareth with
them, hoping in charity God will at
length reveal their Error to them by the
ministry of his Servants, through the
powerful Operation of his Spirit, and not
suffer them to run on in dividing Courses
from the rest of his People: So should
we do in like cases; partly, because when
these Differences of Opinion breed Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
and Separations, the Church is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed:
Gal. 5. 15. <hi>For if ye bite and
devour one another, take heed ye be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
one of another.</hi> Backbitings, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings,
and Reproaches, make way for a
total Vastation of the whole Church, a
ruin to both Parties: Partly, because the
whole is scandalized; John 17. 21. <hi>That
they may all be one, that the World may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that thou hast sent me.</hi> Divisions in
the Church, breed Atheism in the World;
Partly, because there are Enemies which
watch for our halting, and by our Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we are laid open to them. Our Lord
and Master hath told us with his own
Mouth, That <hi>a Kingdom divided against
it self, cannot stand,</hi> Mat. 12. 35. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was it so well with the People of God,
but besides their Divisions among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they had common Enemies: and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:64994:98"/>
                     <hi>Nazianzen</hi> calls them, <hi>Common Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi>
because they should ingage God's
People to an unanimous opposition to the
Kingdom of Satan in the World. And
partly, because then mutual Means of
Edification are hindred. As long as Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and mutual Forbearance remaineth,
there is hope of doing good to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but when Men break out into op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
Parties, they are prejudiced against
all that Light that they should receive one
from another, suspecting every Point as
counsel from an Enemy: Gal. 4. 16. <hi>Am
I therefore become your Enemy, because I
tell you the Truth?</hi> When Men are once
ingaged in a way of Error, whosoever is
an Enemy to their Error, is counted an
Enemy to themselves. Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a, they can
hardly bear that sound Doctrine which
doth directly cross their Opinions, but are
apt to cavil at all that's said by a Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
And partly, because when Men give
themselves up to separating and narrow
Principles, the Power of Godliness is
lost, and all their Zeal is laid out upon
their petty and private Opinions, and so
Religion is turned into a disputacity. That's
the Reason why the Apostle doth so often
tell them, <hi>Gal. 6. 15. For in Christ Iesus
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64994:98"/>
neither Circumcision availeth any thing, nor
Vncircumcision, but a new Creature.</hi> And,
<hi>Gal. 5. 6. For in Iesus Christ neither Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
availeth any thing, nor Vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
but Faith that worketh by Love.</hi>
And, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 19. Circumcision is nothing,
and Vncircumcision is nothing, but the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Commandments of God.</hi> Observe
it where you will, and you shall find,
that Separation and Distance from the rest
of Believers, doth not befriend Godliness,
but undermine it. A Regiment fighting
apart from the rest of the Army of Christ,
is always lost through their own peevish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
at least, they lose great Advantages
of promoting the Kingdom of Christ.</p>
                  <p>3. To prevent this open Rupture, there
must be all Lenity used, and mutual For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance;
we must not rigorously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude
our Conceits upon others, either by
Church-Power, or private Censure; it
may be done either way: Sometimes by
Church-Power, especially when 'tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
or invaded by the more self-seeking
sort of Christians: as we read in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi>
of the Beast that pushed with
the Horns of a Lamb; that is, used
Church-Power, and under a pretence of
Church-Constitution, destroyed them that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64994:99"/>
were truly the Church of Christ. And
our Lord telleth us, <hi>Iohn 16. 2. They
shall put you out of the Synagogues: yea,
the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you,
shall think that he doth God good service.</hi>
Putting them out of the Synagogues, was
an abuse of Ecclesiastical Power; it may
be so, the Builders may refuse the Corner-Stone.
On the other side; private Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
may as much break the Law of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance,
as publick Censures. When
Inferiors promote their Differences with
Turbulency, Heat, and Animosity, and
rend and tear all things, yea themselves,
from the Body of Christ, and sober Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
censuring all that dissent from
them, as no Christians. There is such a
Sin under the Gospel, as the gain-saying
of <hi>Corah,</hi> Jude 11. The Sin of <hi>Corah</hi> is
and may be committed in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Sin of <hi>Corah</hi> was invading
an Office, that no way belonged to him;
and censured his Superiors, as if they
took too much upon them, because all the
Lord's People were Holy, and erected
another Ministry in their stead: He being
a Levite, would do the Office of a Priest
as well as <hi>Aaron;</hi> and when summoned to
appear before <hi>Moses,</hi> said, <hi>We will not
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64994:99"/>
come,</hi> Numb. 16. 11, 12. Now the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
saith, in the perishing of <hi>Korah,</hi> their
own Doom was foretold. Again, <hi>vers.</hi>
19. These are they that separate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
sensual, not having the Spirit.
Whence 'tis clear, that private Men, in
their Sphere, may rend the Church. And
the Factions at <hi>Corinth</hi> proved it, 1 <hi>Cor.
1. 12. I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I am of</hi> Apollo,
<hi>and I am of</hi> Cephas, <hi>and I am of</hi> Christ:
As impailing and impropriating the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Salvation to themselves. Much mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
was the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 2. Iesus
Christ, theirs and ours.</hi> Now what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
is there, but Lenity and mutual
Forbearance? This I shall state,</p>
                  <p>1. As to the matter of the strife. It
must be considered, that we must dispense
this Forbearance as the Matter will bear.
There are great Disputes about <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
only let me tell you now, that we
speak not of the Toleration of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
but of the Church, what things
are within the latitude of allowable Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
within the Church. The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
Concessions may be larger; for in
supernatural Things, such as Matters of
Religion are, he may bear with that which
the Church ought not to bear with in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:64994:100"/>
them that have submitted to an higher In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
or in its own Members, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
private Christians one with another.
But in this limited Forbearance, there are
Extreams, and for want of right stating
of things, Men fight with their Friends in
the dark; some think all things should
be suffered; some nothing wherein to
bear with our Brethren. The one sort
of Christians is for imposing on their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
all things that have gotten the
vogue and the favour of Authority, and
that not only on their Practice, but their
Judgments too: And this in Matters not
fundamental or destructive to Faith or
Worship, but in things controversal or
doubtful among godly and peaceable
Men. But if it should not go so high,
contending about every Difference of
Opinion, and urging our Brethren with
every thing we conceive to be right, is a
Breach of Christian Love, and destroyeth
the use of those differing Gifts which
Christ hath given to the Church, and cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
his Mind in the frame of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which are clear in Soul-saving Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
in other things, especially Matters of
Discipline and Order, more dark and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure.
'Tis also contrary to the mild and
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64994:100"/>
gentle Government of the Apostles, who
press in lesser Matters a Forbearance; as
<hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 14. 1. <hi>The weak in Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
but not to doubtful Disputations;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, own him, but do not cast him
out of the Church, nor trouble him for
doubtful Things, but let him come to
himself, for Men will sooner be led than
drawn.</p>
                  <p>The other Extream is, of them that
will have all things to be tolerated, even
Blasphemy and Fundamental Errors, as if
the Scriptures were uncertain in all things.
No, in Things absolutely necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
'tis clear, open, and plain, <hi>The
Law is a Lamp, and a Light,</hi> Prov. 6. 23.
and <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 105. And in such a case
we are not <hi>to bid him God-speed,</hi> 2 Epist.
<hi>Iohn</hi> 10. In such cases of damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resy,
the Law of Christian Lenity holdeth
not; but if we agree in the principal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith, let us embrace one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with mutual Love, though we differ
from one another in variety of Rites and
Ceremonies, and Discipline Ecclesiastical;
if we agree in the Substantials of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
let us go by the same Rule, do the
same Thing: Though in Circumstantials
there be a difference, these are Matters of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64994:101"/>
lesser moment than Separation, or the other
division of the Church.</p>
                  <p>2. As to the Persons contending, there
is a difference: The Apostle, when he
perswadeth this Lenity and mutual For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance,
excepts those that raise Troubles
in the Church, and distinguisheth between
Erring Christians, and their Factious
Guides; Vers. 2. <hi>Beware of Dogs, beware
of Evil Workers, beware of the Concision;</hi>
the poor seduced Christians he would
have to be pittied; but the Renders and
Cutters of the Church, he would have
them beware of such.</p>
                  <p>3. The Forbearance it self; 'tis not a
Forbearance out of Necessity, because we
dare do no otherwise, but voluntary choice
out of Christian Pitty and Compassion,
knowing that we need as much Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
from God and others, for we all
have our Mistakes and Failings; not a
Forbearance out of Policy, till we get
opportunity to suppress others: The Sons
of <hi>Zerviah</hi> are too hard for us; God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
layeth that restraint upon us by his
Providence; and 'tis well he doth: but it
should be the restraint of Grace, not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to our own ease, lest we create trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to our selves, but upon Christian
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64994:101"/>
Reasons. No, the Apostle sheweth you
whence this Forbearance should come;
Ephes. 4. 2, 3. <hi>With all lowliness and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and long-suffering, forbearing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Love; endeavouring to keep the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are four Graces enforce it.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Lowliness, which is a Grace and
Vertue, whereby a Man, from the sense
of his own Infirmities, doth esteem but
meanly and soberly of himself, and all that
is his.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Meekness, whereby we are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
tractable, gentle, affable, and easy
to be intreated and conversed withal,
<hi>Iam.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Long-suffering, which is nothing
but Meekness extended or continued, and
not interrupted by length of Time, or
multiplication of Offences.</p>
                  <p>(4.) Love to our Christian Brother or
Neighbour, whereby our Hearts are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,
or well-disposed towards them for
their good. <hi>Love covereth a multitude of Sins,</hi>
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 8. Maketh us bear with many
things in the Person loved: 1 Cor. 13. 4.
<hi>Charity suffereth long, and is kind.</hi> And,
<hi>Vers. 7. Beareth all things, hopeth all things.</hi>
This is the Forbearance we press, a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64994:102"/>
out of Meekness, and Humility,
and Love for Christ's sake.</p>
                  <p>4. In this Forbearance, both strong and
weak have their part, and are much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
as having either of them much
to do herein. Which that we may clear
to you, let us consider,</p>
                  <p>1<hi>st.</hi> What they are not to do.</p>
                  <p>1. Not to leave the Truth, or to do
any thing against it: No, the Apostle
saith, <hi>Let as many as be perfect, be thus
minded;</hi> not change Truth for Error.
Strings in Tune must not be brought
down to strings out of Tune, but they
brought up to them.</p>
                  <p>2. Not to connive at their Sin or Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
for that is not Love but Hatred;
Levit. 19. 17. <hi>Thou shalt not hate thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in thine Heart; thou shalt in any wise
rebuke thy Neighbour, and not suffer Sin
upon him.</hi> To let him go unconvinced, is
to harden him; 2 Thess. 3. 15. <hi>Yet count
him not as an Enemy, but admonish him as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
Brother.</hi> The Sins of others must not be le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
alone, under the pretence of Forbearance;
and there must be no neglect of Means to
reclaim them from their Sin, but meekly
we are to hold our Light to them, and use
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64994:102"/>
all Holy Means of convincing and satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Judgments.</p>
                  <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> What they are to do.</p>
                  <p>1. The Strong are not to deal rigorou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly
with the Weak, nor insult over them,
nor pursue them with Censures, but wait
till God declare the Truth un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o them, and
must promote their Conviction with all
gentleness and condescension. We are to
feed Christ's Lambs as well as his Sheep,
and for both we need Love, <hi>Iohn</hi> 21. 15,
16. Among the Flock of Christ, there
are variety of Tempers and Degrees of
Strength, both Lambs and Sheep, we must
imitate our Lord: <hi>Isa. 40. 11. He shall
feed his Flock like a Shepherd; he shall
gather the Lambs with his Arms, and carry
them in his Bosom; and shall gently lead
those that are with young.</hi> We should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend
to the weak and feeble Ones, as
well as consider what the strong and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
can bear: though we cannot love
their Weakness, yet we must love the
Weak, and bear with the Infirmities of
the Weak, not break the bruised Reed.
Infants must not be turned out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
because they cry, and are unquiet
and troublesome; though they be peevish
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:64994:103"/>
and froward, yet we must bear it with
gentleness and patience, as we do the
frowardness of the Sick; if they revile,
we must not revile again, but must seek
gently to reduce them, notwithstanding
all their Censures; to entertain them with
contempt, is to prejudice them quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all Instruction. <hi>Iob</hi> would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
the Cause of his Man-servant, or
Maid-servant, when they contended with
him, <hi>Iob</hi> 31. 13.</p>
                  <p>2. The Weak. But who will own this
Title and Appellation? Because in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
of Religion, all seem to stand
upon the same Level, and another differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from me, as much as I do from him;
their Opinion is as far from mine, as mine
from theirs; who then shall be accounted
weak?</p>
                  <p>I Answer;</p>
                  <p>1. Our Rule is plain; and as it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisheth
Error from Truth, so Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and partial Christianity from that
which is more perfect and thorough. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
'tis clear, some have not the Gifts of
Knowledg and Experience that others
have, nor such advantages of Education
and Study, and helps of knowing the
Truth; and though they are not to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64994:103"/>
their Understandings to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of others, yet they should search,
and search again and again, and have dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Light, when they are by the seeming
Evidence of Truth forced to differ.</p>
                  <p>2. Christianity teacheth us to think
meanly of our selves, and not to be wise
in our own Conceits; Phil. 2. 3. <hi>In low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of mind, let each esteem others better
than themselves;</hi> at least, we should have
such a sense of our Imperfections, as to
make us tractable and teachable.</p>
                  <p>3. If you will not own your selves
Weak, do the part of the Strong meekly,
hold forth your Light, produce your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to convince others; but if you have
nothing to produce but your Obstinacy
and Ignorance, surely you are not only a
weak, but a perverse Brother. But what
are the Weak to do? not to rend and cut
off themselves from the rest of Christians,
or be strange to them upon every lesser
dissent, nor to raise Troubles by your
Censures, but to be humble, teachable,
diligent in the use of Means, to lay aside
obstinate Prejudices, to examine how it
cometh to pass that the rest of the Godly
and you differ; to leave room still for the
discovery of God's Mind, where your
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64994:104"/>
Grounds are not clear and certain, and to
count it no shame to retract that former
practice which a future Conviction dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth.</p>
                  <p>II. The Reasons.</p>
                  <p>1. From the Necessity, Excellency, and
Utility of Union: What more clear in
the Scriptures, than that Christians should
endeavour to be united. Christ prayed
for it, <hi>Ioh. 17. 21, 22, 23. That they all may
be One; that they may be One as we are One;
that they may be perfect in One.</hi> And the
Apostle enforceth it, by the most vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Intreaties that can be used. Phil. 2.
1, 2. <hi>If therefore there be any Consolation in
Christ, if any Comfort of Love, if any Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
of the Spirit, if any Bowels of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
fulfil ye my Ioy, that ye be like-minded,
having the same Love, being of one Accord,
and of one Mind.</hi> Who can withstand
such an adjuration and powerful beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
as these? that if ever they found any
comfort by his Ministry, and ever had any
Hope by Christ, ever any Influence of
the Spirit, ever any Pity and Compassion
over Souls, that they would look after
Unity in Judgment, Love, and Affection,
and lay aside their Differences, and Carnal
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64994:104"/>
Emulations? Again, they caution us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those that cause Divisions; <hi>Rom.</hi>
16. 17, 18. <hi>Now I beseech you, Brethren,
mark them which cause Divisions and Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
contrary to the Doctrine which ye have
learned, and avoid them; for they that are
such, serve not our Lord Iesus Christ, but
their own Belly; and by good Words, and
fair Speeches, deceive the Hearts of the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
They press Unity upon us by very
cogent Arguments, that carry the highest
Reason with them; Ephes. 4. 4, 5, 6. <hi>There
is one Body, and one Spirit, even as ye are
called in one Hope of your Calling, one Lord,
one Faith, one Baptism, one God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of all, who is above all, and through all,
and in you all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seven uniting Considerations are there
heaped up together.</p>
                  <p>1. There is one Body of Christ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
all are Members. The whole Church
maketh but one Body knit by Faith to
Christ their Head, and by the Bond of
Love among themselves; and the meanest
Christian is a Member in this Body. Now
'tis unnatural, if the Members of the same
Body should tear and destroy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and that the Body of Christ should
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:64994:105"/>
be rent and torn; and wo be to them by
whom it is so.</p>
                  <p>2. This Body is animated by one Spirit,
that if any be a Member of this Body, it's
necessary that he have the Spirit of God
abiding in him, to renew and quicken
him. Now this one and the self-same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as the Apostle calleth him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.
13. worketh in all the Saints; if his Gifts
be various, they proceed from the same
Author, and they are variously dispensed
to preserve Society and Communion, that
one may not say to another, <hi>I have no
need of thee.</hi> However, there is but one
new Nature in all the Sancti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ied.</p>
                  <p>3. One Hope of Glory. We are all
joint Heirs of the same Kingdom, we all
expect one End and Happiness, where we
shall meet and live together for ever. Now
those that shall meet and live together in
Glory hereafter, should live together in
Peace and Concord here.</p>
                  <p>4. There is one Lord, one Mediator
and Blessed Saviour. Now shall the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of one Master fall at odds with
themselves, neglect their Master's Work
committed to them, beat their fellow-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and eat and drink with the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:64994:105"/>5. One Faith; <hi>Fides quae creditur,</hi> he
meaneth the Doctrine of Faith in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
We agree in the same Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Truths of the Gospel, as the only Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of saving-Faith, and shall we strive
about Things of less Importance and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
there is but one Gospel, which is
the Seed of our New Birth, the Rule of
our Faith and Lives, the Foundation of
our Hope, the Food of our Souls.</p>
                  <p>6. One Baptism, that is the same New
Covenant, sealed and confirmed by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism;
and when our Father's Testament is
clear, do we quarrel about petty and
mean Things?</p>
                  <p>7. One God and Father of all, who is
above all, and through all, and in you
all. We have one common God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
whose Eminency is above all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
whose presence and powerful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
runneth through all Creatures;
but his special Presence, by the gracious
Operations of his Holy Spirit, is in the
Regenerate. Surely this is a strong Bond
of Union, to be one in God, he is the
common Father of all Believers, through
Jesus Christ. Some are Weak, some
Strong, some Rich, some Poor, but they
have all an equal Interest in God. Now for
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64994:106"/>
us, who are so many ways one, to be rent
in pieces; How sad is that! All these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and many more, shew how every
Christian should, as far as 'tis possible, be
an esteemer and promoter of Unity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Brethren, and not only make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of Purity, but of Unity also,
which next to Purity, is the great Badg
of Christianity.</p>
                  <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> From the consideration of our
mutual Frailties, who have all in part a
corrupt Will, guided by a blind Mind.
Now as the Apostle saith of the High
Priest, who is taken from Men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.
2. That <hi>he is one that can have compassion of
the Ignorant, and them that are out of the
way, for that he is compassed about with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</hi>
This should be verified in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of us; one Sinner ought to have
compassion of another; the word is
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, can reasonably
bear with the ignorance of Brethren, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the common Relation. <hi>Gal. 6. 1.
Ye which are Spiritual, restore him with
meekness; so him that is weak, receive,</hi>
Rom, 14. 1. The Apostles being imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
inspired, were more infallible than
we are.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:64994:106"/>Oh, do but consider what we were,
and what we are; <hi>For we our selves were
sometimes foolish and disobedient,</hi> Titus 3. 3.
Did not we all sit in Darkness, and in
the shadow of Death? Were we not all
ignorant of the Ways of God, and the
Things which belong to our Peace? Hath
God meerly by his Grace brought us to
the knowledg of his Truth, and shall we
contemn and disdain our weak Brother?
or insult over him, and determine and
judg rashly of him? <hi>Who maketh thee to
differ? 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
                  <p>2. What we are: weak Creatures, not
infallible; now after we are light in the
Lord, we have our Errors in Knowledg
and Practice, some more, some less, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the degree of our growth;
<hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 12. God revealeth to his Saints
all necessary Truth, but not every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Truth, out of wise Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>3<hi>dly.</hi> From the consideration of the
probability of Divine Illumination.</p>
                  <p>1. This Illumination cometh from God
only. 'Tis he that powerfully revealeth
it, and setleth the Heart in the belief of
it, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 4. And, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 6, 7. I
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:64994:107"/>
have planted,</hi> Apollos <hi>watered, but God
gave the increase.</hi> The best Means may be
disappointed, till God cooperate with
them; let us then with patience use the
Means, and refer the Issue to God; 2 <hi>Tim.
2. 25. In meekness instructing those that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
themselves, if peradventure God will
give them Repentance unto Life.</hi> If we
seek to force Men to our Opinion, before
Men are convinced, that is a <hi>tyranny</hi> which
will do little good; it may make Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
but it will never make real Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts.</p>
                  <p>2. This Illumination is given by God
by degrees: The Apostle prayeth for the
converted <hi>Ephesians,</hi> That <hi>God would give
them the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation,</hi>
Ephes. 1. 17. They had it before, but he
meaneth a greater measure. Therefore
weak Christians are not to be discouraged,
though they see not as far as others; some
see more, some less, according to the state
and condition wherein God will imploy
them. Some need more Light than others,
as Ministers more than People, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
more than Inferiors; but all have
sufficient: some at first see Men walking
like Trees, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 24, 25. but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Light groweth more clear
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:64994:107"/>
and more distinct. In short, he doth not
reveal his Mind to his Children all alike,
nor all at once, but here a little, and there
a little, as narrow-mouth'd Vessels can
take it in.</p>
                  <p>3. Those who are not for the present,
may be afterwards instructed in the Truth.
The Apostle proceedeth in the hopes of
that;</p>
                  <p>1. Upon the Supposition, That they
were already converted to the Christian
Faith, and were sincere in the Belief and
Profession of it. Those that belong to
God, will one time or other be enlightned
in the knowledg of all necessary Truths;
<hi>For God that hath begun a good Work, will
perfect it,</hi> Phil. 1. 6. If the Saints at first
Conversion, when they were called from
Darkness to Light, did not hinder Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
then, and the knowledg of those
many Soul-saving Truths which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
to them then, so as to recover
them from a partial Error, we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
that God will give them a farther
understanding of the Way of Salvation,
though now under some Error; as <hi>Aquila</hi>
and <hi>Priscilla</hi> expounded to <hi>Apollos</hi> the
Way of God more perfectly, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.
26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:64994:108"/>2. Upon the Supposition that they
were humble and tractable; <hi>Psal. 25. 9.
The Meek he will guide in Iudgment, the
Meek he will teach his Way.</hi> They lie open
to Information; but if Men be puffed
up with Self-conceits, there is more hopes
of a Carnal Fool than of them, that is, a
sensual and brutish Man.</p>
                  <p>3. That they will not neglect any
means of Study and Prayer: Study; For
we must dig for Knowledg as for Silver,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 4. not only cry for it, but dig
for it in the Mines of Knowledg; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and obvious Apprehensions lead us
into Error. And then Prayer, <hi>Psal. 119.
18. Lord open mine Eyes, that I may see
wondrous Things out of thy Law.</hi> God
must take away the Vail. Now then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
prayer to God, and applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the use of Holy Means, God
will shew them they are deceived. If you
Study and not Pray; 'tis just with God
to leave you to your Prejudices; if you
pray, and neglect Means, you must not
think that God will extraordinarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
you, for he revealeth Truth by his
Blessing on ordinary Means.</p>
                  <p>4. Upon suspicion that they continue
in the Communion of the Church, <hi>Ephes.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64994:108"/>
4. 15. Speaking the Truth in love.</hi> While
we keep Unity, and keep Love, others
have greater hopes to convince, they to
be convinced; and so both, while they
divide not, by this mutual Condescension,
may the better wait for this Illumination;
but in their Separation, their Errors are
confirmed while they hear but one side,
nothing to undeceive them, but all to
root them in their Errors.</p>
                  <p>5. He supposeth that they walked or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
according to their Light. Now if
God hath begun to enlighten them in
other things, he will discover more Truths
to them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 17. Upon the whole,
deal tenderly with them, and tolerate
them, till they be taught of God.</p>
                  <p>6. As to the Nature of his Confidence,
<hi>God shall reveal.</hi> There is a two-fold
Confidence, a Confidence of Faith groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on a Promise, and a Confidence of
Charity grounded on Appearance and
Probability, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7. We hope the
best, though the Event doth not always
follow, the former is on the fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Grounds, the latter on Appearance.
The Appearance of them; so, <hi>Gal. 5. 10.
I have confidence in you, through the Lord,
that ye will be no otherwise minded; for he
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64994:109"/>
that troubleth you, shall bear his Iudgment
whoever be be.</hi> This Confidence was
grounded on Charity, that through the
Lord's Grace they should be reclaimed
from their Error, and brought to imbrace
the Truth. We are not to despair of
the recovery of any, but in charity to
hope the best of all Men, as long as they
are cureable. Thus for the third Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p>4<hi>th</hi> Reason, from the temper of those
that are perfect. A grounded Christian
beareth with the Infirmities he seeth in
others, and pitieth and helpeth them, and
prayeth for them more than the Weak,

the Substantials of Faith and Worship;
<hi>Ier. 32. 30. I will give them one Heart, and

                        <pb n="210" facs="tcp:64994:110"/>2. Take more notice of their Graces,

                     <p>3. Remember how open the Enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

much the Grounds of Separation lie in
the dark, and are in a doubtful Case, but
Union is the safest part.</p>
                     <p>4. Think of God's Love and Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
towards us, before we received the
Light of his Truth, and were brought to
the Obedience of his Will; as God dealt
with the Israelites, so with every one of
us; Acts 13. 18. <hi>He suffered their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in the Wilderness;</hi> If we had been
dealt with rigorously, we had been cut off
from the number of God's People, had
such Stumbling-blocks and Prejudices laid
in our way, that we should never have
been converted to God.</p>

                        <pb n="211" facs="tcp:64994:110"/>5. This Forbearance cannot in Reason
be expected from others to our selves, if
we be not ready to repay it to others.
There is no Man which hath not Infirmities
of his own, which call for Forbearance,
<hi>Iam</hi> 3. 2. In the general, Every Man is
obliged to do as he would be done unto,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12. So in particular, He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved

<hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 28. We have all our Failings

punisheth Separations with Separations:
they are endless; as Circles in the Water
beget one another.</p>
                     <p>6. Consider how dangerous it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
any whom Christ will own for his:
Will Christ admit him to Heaven, and
will you think him unfit for your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
here upon Earth? Despise not
the weak Brother, for God hath received
him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 3. The Gentile Believer
must not despise the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Believer, and cast out of his Communion
the Gentile Christian: if God hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:64994:111"/>
him into his Family, shall we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him? So, <hi>Matth. 18. 6. Whosoever
shall offend one of these little Ones which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in me, it were better that a Milstone
were hanged about his Neck, and that he
were cast into the Sea.</hi> Now what greater
Offence, than to cast them off from the
Privileges of the Christian Church, either
by publick or private Censures, which are
causless or unwarrantable, at least no way
grounded on necessary Things?</p>
                     <p>7. As we must not on our part give
Offence, or occasion the Divisions, so we
must not take Offence when 'tis given by
others; for Charity, as it provoketh not,
so it is not easily provoked, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5.
So likewise if a Rent be made by others,
we must do what we can to heal it; if an
angry Brother call us Bastard, yet let us
own him as a Brother, and a Child of the
Family; for, <hi>Blessed are the Peace-makers,
Matth.</hi> 5. 9. The World censureth us for

Poor are Evangelized; have not only the
Promises of the Gospel offered to them,
but the impression and power of it is left
upon their Hearts: By the Poor, may be
meant the humble-minded, or Persons of
the meanest and lowest Condition: <hi>The

The Gospel doth affect the poor needy
Soul, so as to put a stamp of Grace upon
it. They that are sensible of their Sin and
Misery, are the proper Objects of this
Dispensation: or else it may be meant of
<hi>Persons of the meanest and lowest condition.</hi>
The Christian Church was made up of
such at first; James 2. 5. <hi>Hearken my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Brethren, Hath not God chosen the
po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:64994:114"/>
the Kingdom which he hath promised to
them that love him?</hi> And, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 26.
For ye see your Calling, Brethren, how
that not many wise Men after the Flesh, not
many mighty, not many noble are called.</hi>
Christ did not then call the Eminent and
Great, but the obscure and despised of
the World, lest Religion should seem to
owe its growth and progress, rather to the
Power of the World, than to the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Truth. Now these are said
to be Evangelized, that is, to have a good
share in the blessed Message, they above
others being wrought upon and affected
with it. To be Evangelized, implyeth
Grace on God's part, and on theirs, a
willing reception of the Impression of it,
so as to be changed by it. The Poor are
all to be gospelled; those whose Poverty
is sanctified, to make way for brokenness
of Heart; which is not said to exclude
the Rich from all Benefit, some were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
then, though not many. Grace where
it prevails in the Heart, puts Rich and
Poor on the same level. It humbleth the
Rich, and exalteth the Poor, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 9,
10. It teacheth the one to abound, the
other to be abased, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 12. Poverty
and Riches do as they are used. Now,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:64994:114"/>
saith Christ, tell <hi>Iohn</hi> the things that ye
hear and see; let him expound the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of the <hi>Messiah</hi> as they lie in the
Old Testament; and if they be verified
in me, see what Application and Inference
you ought to make: Therefore he dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them with this Conclusion; <hi>And
blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended
in me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which words observe,</p>
                  <p>1. The Privilege; <hi>And blessed is he:</hi>
'tis meant of our Supream Blessedness.</p>
                  <p>2. The Qualification; <hi>Whosoever is not
offended in me.</hi> Where observe, 1. 'Tis
Negatively expressed; <hi>Not offended.</hi>
2. There is an universal Negative; <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is not.</hi> But are all those who are
not offended at Christ, saved? I answer,
No, you must look upon this Conclusion,
as annexed to the last clause of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Verse,—<hi>The Poor have the Gospel
preached unto them: And blessed is he who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall not be offended in me.</hi> To be
offended, is to be scandalized, or kept
from owning Christ as the True Messiah:
All are happy and blessed, so far as they
are Evangelized; and miserable, so far as
Scandalized. When the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is brought to us, nothing can bar us
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:64994:115"/>
from entring into it, but our being offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Christ. But if we be not scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
so as to hinder our being Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
Then we are in a happy and blessed
Condition; that is, blessed so far, as the
impediment of our Blessedness is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and indeed, that is all the blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
we can attain unto in this Life. Thus
Blessedness is ascribed to pardon of Sins,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 1. because that taketh away the
legal Impediment. Blessedness is ascribed
to Sanctification, <hi>Psal. 119. 1. Blessed are
the undefiled in the Way;</hi> because that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth
the moral Incapacity, and so is a
forerunner of Eternal Happiness: And
here 'tis ascribed, to not being offended
in Christ, when he is sufficiently revealed
to us, as it removeth the Impediment of
our Faith, which is always some offence
and dislike that we take at Christ, and the
Ways of God.</p>
                  <p>The Point that I shall insist on, is this;</p>
                  <p>That whosoever being invited to embrace
the Gospel, is not offended in Christ,
is in the ready way to true Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

Christ.</p>
                  <p>I Answer, To be offended in Christ, is
to be offended because of Christ. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in him which we dislike, which is
an hindrance to our receiving and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him in that quality wherein he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the World, and offereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to us: namely, as our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,

                     </gap>, in the natural sense of
it, signifieth either any obstacle or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
laid in a Man's way, by which the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:64994:116"/>
Passenger is detained or stopped: Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
it is put for those sharp Stakes which
they were wont to stick in the Ground in
the ancient way of warring, to wound
the Feet and Legs of their Enemies in
their pursuit of them; against which they
used greaves of Brass; most usually, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
signifieth a Stone or Block in the way, at
which a Man is apt to stumble and fall.
So, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 8. Vnto them which believe,
Christ is precious; but a Stone of stumbling,
and a Rock of offence, to them that stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thereat.</hi> A Rock with respect to those
that travel by Sea; a Stone of stumbling,
with respect to those that travel by Land:
so 'tis used here, <hi>Who are not scandalized
at Christ.</hi> In this Expression, there is
something expressed, and something sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
                  <p>1. It supposeth some Offer and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
made to us; that Grace is brought
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ome to us, and Salvation offered to us:
Jews, and professing Christians, are more
properly said to be offended in Christ,
than Heathens who never heard, nor
sought after him; 1 Cor. 1. 23. <hi>We preach
Christ crucified, to the Iews a stumbling-block,
to the Greeks, foolishness.</hi> They
stumble, who being invited to come to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:64994:116"/>
him, dislike and are displeased with some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in him; or being on their way, are
upon some occasion and temptations, laid
aside and prejudiced; and either stumble
or fall in the way undertaken by them, or
have no heart to go forward, but either
directly retire or saint.</p>
                  <p>2. It expresseth or implieth such an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
that either they are kept off from
Christ, or else drawn away from him.</p>
                  <p>1. Some are kept off by their Carnal
Prejudices, or offence they take at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of Christ, and so continue in their
unbelief; thus Christ is said to be a Rock
of Offence to the <hi>Disobedient,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 8.
that is, the impenitent and unbelieving
World, who out of indulgence to their
Lusts, slight an offered Saviour.</p>
                  <p>2. Others are drawn from him: as
those that had carnal Expectation when
they were disappointed; Joh. 6. 6. <hi>From
that time many of his Disciples went back,
and walked no more with him.</hi> This is the
Offence, when we are either discouraged
from, or in the ways of Godliness.</p>
                  <p>I now come to shew you,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Upon what Occasions were
Men then offended in Christ: They were

displeased with his Person, Sufferings, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>1. His Person: They were somewhat
alarm'd with his Miracles, and the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of his gracious Speeches; but how to
reconcile this with the meanness of his
Person, they were at a loss; sometimes
his birth and breeding were a distaste to
them; Matth. 13. 55, 56. <hi>Is not this the
Carpenter's Son? is not his Mother called</hi>
Mary? <hi>and his Brethren,</hi> James, Joses,
Simon, Judas? <hi>And his Sisters, are they
not all with us? Whence then hath this
Man all these things? And they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
in him.</hi> So, <hi>Mark 6. 3. Is not this
the Carpenter,</hi> brought up in the same
Trade with <hi>Ioseph?</hi> Thus upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of his mean and known begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
they forsook him. Sometimes they
quarrelled at his Country, not where he
was born, but bred: He was born in
<hi>Bethlehem,</hi> but bred in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> which
was in <hi>Galilee:</hi> And <hi>Galilee,</hi> as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
was looked upon by God, as a
mean and despicable place; John 7. 52.
<hi>Art thou of</hi> Galilee, (speaking to <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus)
search and look, for out of</hi> Galilee
<hi>ariseth no Prophet:</hi> This was the common
conceit, for <hi>Iona</hi> was of that Country.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:64994:117"/>
So, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 41. When some said, This is
the Christ; others said, Shall Christ come
out of <hi>Galilee?</hi> that Country was under
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> reproach: Nay, a good Man was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with this prejudice, <hi>Iohn 1. 46.
Can any good thing come out of</hi> Nazareth?
<hi>And</hi> Philip <hi>saith, Come and see.</hi> Trial
would make him of another Mind. But
many good People are led away with
common prejudice, and so over-look
Things and Persons of the chiefest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sometimes they were offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the meanness of his Followers; <hi>Iohn
7. 48. Have any of the Rulers and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees
believed in him? But this People that
knoweth not the Law, are cursed;</hi> that is,
the Rabble are ready to follow any false
Teacher; and such ones follow him.</p>
                  <p>2. They were offended at his Doctrine,
the Mysteriousness of it; as when he had
spoken of eating his Flesh, and drinking
his Blood, they could not tell what to
make of it. If it signified any thing, it
signified his Death, and that was a Point
not to be touched upon in the hearing of
them, that expected a glorious pompous
Messiah, that should subjugate other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to them. Therefore Christ saith,
<hi>Doth this offend you?</hi> John 6. 61. Yea,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:64994:118"/>
the Offence was so great, that <hi>many of his
Disciples went backward, and walked no more
with him,</hi> verse 66. Sometimes they were
offended at the Holiness of it; as when he
pressed the Pharisees, who were altogether
for external Observances, to look af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ward Cleansing. Mat. 15. 12. <hi>Knowest
thou not that the Pharisees were offended af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they heard this saying?</hi> This was a great
distaste to them, to hear that a Man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
by Sin, and not at all by Meats, and
that the washing of the Heart is the chief
thing.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>The great stumbling-block of all,
was his Sufferings: This offended Good
and Bad; The Good,</hi> Mat. 26. 31. All
of you shall be offended because of me this
night: For it is written, I will smi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Shepherd, and the Sheep of the Flock shall
be scattered abroad. And <hi>Peter</hi> saith,
Though all Men shall be offended because of
thee, yet will I never be offended, <hi>vers. 33.
The Bad: This was the great Stumbling-block
to the Jews,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 23. We preach
Christ crucified, unto the Iews a stumbling-block.
<hi>By this they f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d their obstinacy
and prejudice; they could not believe
that he that was crucified as a Malefactor,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:64994:118"/>
was the Son of God, and the Saviour of
the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Was it not proper to that Age
only? I Answer: No, We also may be
prejudiced and guilty of this Sin, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
offended in Christ. You will say,
What danger is there of that now, since
Christ is publickly owned, and Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in fashion, and the World run into
the Church?</p>
                  <p>I shall shew you;
<list>
                        <item>1. That there is danger still.</item>
                        <item>2. What is likely to offend since Christ's
Exaltation.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. There is danger still.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Because though the Name of
Christ be had in honour, yet the stricter
profession and practice of Godliness, is
under reproach; and the nominal, hateth
the serious Christian; tho both own the
same Bible, believe the same Creed, and
are baptized with one and the same Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
into the same Profession: Those
that are false to their Religion, will m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign
and scorn those that are true to it,
and live up to the Power of it: As there
is no commerce between the Living and
the Dead, so no true friendship between
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:64994:119"/>
the Carnal and the Heavenly. Among
the out-side Christians, it will be matter
of Reproach to be serious and diligent;
and they that are so, will be accounted more
precise and nice, than wise. No wonder
if they slight you, who first slight God,
and Christ, and their own Salvation.</p>
                  <p>(2.) It may happen, that the stricter
sort of Christians, are the poorer sort;
and such as carry no great port and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
in the World: And so, though
they be precious in the Eyes of God, yet
they may be despised by Men. Strictness
of Religion is many times looked upon
by some, as too mean a thing for Persons
of their Rank and Quality; and so whilst
the Poor receive the Gospel, they, to
keep up their greatness, go the broad way
to Hell; these are offended in Christ. In
<hi>Salvian</hi>'s Time; <hi>Quantus in Christiano po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo
honor Christi est, ubi religio ignobilem
facit: Coguntur esse mali neviles habeantur.</hi>
Religion makes them base, and Men are
compelled to be evil, that they may not
be scorned and disgraced. Now we
should resolve to be more vile for God,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 22.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Though Men be not distasted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Christianity in whole, yet in part:
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64994:119"/>
though they be not offended in Christ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together,
yet they take offence at some
of his ways, wherein his Glory and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
is concerned. In the Age that we
live in, many of those things that f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll
within the Conscience, and compass of
our Duty, may be under a cloud and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteem:
Now they that have received
light about these things, should not be
offended, though the generality of the
World decry and oppose them. Christ
gets up by degrees; and where the Main
of Religion is received, yet all the parts
and branches of it are not received, which
must be required in their place; and
though we are not always bound to the
positive profession of lesser things, yet
we are bound negatively; we must do
nothing against the Truth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8.
We must not renounce a Truth, because
it is run down by vulgar Prejudice, but
in all meekness of Wisdom own the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
way: Such constancy of mind is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from a good Man, who consults
with Conscience, rather than Interest.</p>
                  <p>(4.) The World may not be able to
bear the owning of these Truths; and
therefore those who set them afoot, may
be disgraced, afflicted, and reproachfully
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64994:120"/>
used; but the knowledg of an hated
Truth, is a greater Argument of God's
Favour, than the prosperity of the World.
Prov. 3. 32. <hi>Envy thou not the Oppressor,
and chuse none of his ways; for the Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
is an abomination unto the Lord, but his
Secret is with the Righteo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(5.) There is no Man in the World,
but if he run up his refusal of Christ, or
his impenitency and unbelief to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Principle, he will find it to be some
offence or dislike; either because of the
inward constitution of his Mind, or the
external state of Religion in the World:
Either he cannot bring his Heart to suit
with the strictness, purity, and self-denial
of Christ's Religion, or Christ's Religion
to suit with his Heart: As the young Man,
Mark 10. 22. <hi>He was sad at that saying,
and went away grieved, for he had great
Possessions.</hi> Or else if both suit, the World
liketh not the Match; so that it cometh
to this Point, That he must be an Enemy
to God, or the World: James 4. 4. <hi>Ye
Adulterers, and Adulteresses, know ye not
that the friendship of the World is enmity
with God? Whosoever therefore will be a
Friend of the World, is the Enemy of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:64994:120"/>2. What is likely to offend, since
Christ's exaltation of his Person in Heaven,
and his Religion in the Word?</p>
                  <p>(1.) The many Calamities which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Profession of it: <hi>Iohn,</hi> who was
his forerunner, was now in Prison when
Christ spake these words; and Christ fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telleth
grievous Troubles and Afflictions;
Mat. 24. 10.—<hi>And then many shall be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</hi>
And he foretelleth us, that we
may not be offended: John 16. 1. <hi>These
things have I spoken unto you, that ye should
not be offended,</hi> that is, scandalized by the
Hazards which attend Christ's Service, or
take occasion to alienate themselves from
him, yet all will not do; Mat. 13. 21.
<hi>When Persecution ariseth for the Word, by
and by he is offended.</hi> A Man is offended,
when he findeth that which he did not
look for. Many promise themselves ease
and peace in Christianity; and when it
falleth out otherwise, they dislike what
they formerly seemed to prize.</p>
                  <p>(2.) They may take offence at Christ's
Doctrine; at the Purity, the Self-denial,
the Simplicity; the Mysteriousness of it.</p>
                  <p>1. The Purity of it: To Holy Men,
this is an Argument of Love; <hi>Psal. 119.
140. Thy Word is very pure, therefore thy
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:64994:121"/>
Servant loveth it.</hi> But to the Carnal, of
dislike and offence; John 3. 20. <hi>Every
one that doth evil, hateth the Light; neither
cometh he to the Light, lest his Deeds should
be reproved.</hi> They have somewhat to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal,
somewhat which they are loth to
part with. And so, lest they should be
found faulty, and engaged to reform
themselves; they cannot endure the Light
of the Gospel, and are offended at Christ's
strict Doctrine, as sore Eyes are at the
brightness of the Sun: This Light is not
only shining, but scorching.</p>
                  <p>2. The Mortification, and Self-denial
of it. Mortification respects our Lusts,
and Self-denial our Interest: Our
Worldly Interests are the Baits of our
Carnal Desires or Lusts: Now to cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
the Flesh, or deny the World, are both
distastful to Flesh and Blood. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are apt to say, <hi>This is an hard
saying.</hi> And what strange Doctrine is
this? 1 Pet. 4. 4. <hi>They think it strange,
that you run not with them to the same excess
of riot.</hi> 'Tis matter of great admiration,
that others should abandon their course of
Life. The sweetness of Christ's Service,
is wholly hidden from them; therefore
they hate that Religion which they do
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64994:121"/>
profess, and all that are serious in it: They
think strange God should plant desires in
them, which he would not have to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied:
But they do not distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
what Nature craveth, and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
lusteth after: That the inordinacy is
from themselves; and therefore have a
secret dislike of Christ in their Souls, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they would do what they list, not
what they ought. They would not be fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by any of his Laws, or look upon
that Fruit as forbidden, which corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath a longing unto, as if all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
restraint were a kind of Prison to them.</p>
                  <p>3. The simplicity and plainness of the
Gospel, void of humane Wisdom, and
excellency of words. It is a plain thing,
teaching the way how Sinners may return
to God and Blessedness. This Doctrine
is clad in the simple attire of a vulgar
stile; and this was the offence of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
who would be gratified with Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and profound Knowledg: 1 <hi>Cor.
1. 22. The Iews require a Sign, and the
Greeks seek after Wisdom;</hi> that is, the
Jews who were trained up in extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Dispensations, they would have Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
and Prodigies from Heaven: The
Gentiles look for profound Philosophy in
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64994:122"/>
the Gospel, and scorn it, because they
find it not there: Their offence was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they found not matter of Dispute,
but Practice; for they were altogether
bred up in the uncertain Debates of their
Philosophers: But little did these mind
that there was a sublimity of Wisdom in
this plain Doctrine, (1 Cor. 2. 6. <hi>We
speak wisdom among them that are perfect;
yet not the Wisdom of this World,</hi> &amp;c.)
as discovering the true way of easing the
Conscience, and the nature of true Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness;
which were the two things about
which the wisest and profoundest of them
spent all their Thoughts and Speculations:
Nor did they mind this, That Laws would
lose their Authority, if not delivered in
a plain stile; nor would our Duty so
clearly be stated by Man's Reason, as by
God's Authority. When it is to be found
out by Man's Reason, it is left more to
the uncertainty of Dispute. Bare Nature
is an hard Book to study in, nor are the
Lessons of it so easily found out. While
the wise Men of the World were debat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about Felicity and Happiness; Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Godliness died upon their Hands, and
Men strove rather to be witty than good,
and so delivered things more coldly, and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64994:122"/>
not with that Life, and Power, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
for the reclaiming and reducing
Man to his Duty to God. Like the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Wits of our Age, who delight to
speak finely, rather than successfully in
the Matters of Religion.</p>
                  <p>4. The Mysteriousness of it, above all
natural Reason. The Devil playeth on all
hands; sometimes the Doctrine of the
Gospel is too plain, sometimes too mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
It cannot enter into their Hearts to
conceive how God should be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into three Persons; how God should
become Man, and the like: and therefore
scoffing Atheists, such as are rife in the
latter days, question all: And having lost
the Light of their Reason, yet retain the
pride of their Reason, and are objecting
all the Difficulties they can think of, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Truth of the Word of God;
and are apt to say as <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> John 3.
9. <hi>How can these things be?</hi> Till they see
a Reason for every thing, they will not
own it. Indeed, we must see á Reason
why we believe every thing, and that is,
Divine Revelation contained in the Word
of God; but we cannot always see a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of every thing which we do believe,
for many things are Mysteries, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64994:123"/>
them as we do Pills, not chew, but
swallow them; we take them upon the
Credit of the Revealer: to chew, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
a loathsome ejection, to swallow
an wholsome Remedy. Believing in the
common Notion of it, is a receiving a
Truth upon the trust of another: So it
differeth from knowing, for then we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of our selves; and Divine Faith is a
receiving such things as God hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
because he hath revealed them: Then
our first enquiry is, Whether these things
be so or so? not how they can be so?
Therefore we begin at the wrong end, if
we enquire first, How can this be? In
many cases, <hi>constat de re,</hi> the <hi>thing</hi> is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in Scripture; but, <hi>non constat de mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
how it can be, is beyond our reach.
Now when we should believe, we dispute,
and cavil rather than enquire. If any
thing be not plainly revealed by God, you
may reject it without sin; but if it be,
you must not contradict all that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend; The Trinity of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
in the Unity of the Divine Essence;
or how a Virgin should conceive; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
how a God can become Man: 'Tis suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
that all this is revealed in Scripture,
which carrieth its own Evidence in its
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:64994:123"/>
Forehead, and shineth by its own Light,
and hath the Seal and Stamp of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it. In short, to believe, is not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a thing in its own Evidence, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the credit of the Testifier: If you
will not credit it, unless the thing be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in it self, you do not believe Christ,
but your own Reason; and instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thankful for the Revelation, you
quarrel with his Truth, because 'tis some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
above your Capacity: you should
captivate your Understandings to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5.</p>
                  <p>I now come to shew you;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Kinds of this Sin, of
being offended in Christ. Three Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
I shall give you.</p>
                  <p>1. There is an Offence with Contempt,
and an Offence with Discouragement.</p>
                  <p>1. The Offence with Contempt, is,
when we are prejudiced against, or turn
from the Faith; either never embrace it,
or quite forsake it. Contempt produceth
Unbelief and Disobedience: They are so
given over to their sinful Courses, that
they cannot be perswaded to relinquish
them; John 3. 19. <hi>This is the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that Light is come into the World, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64994:124"/>
that Men love Darkness rather than Light,
because their Deeds are Evil.</hi> Nothing
will gain them to submit to Christ's heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Methods, they think he seeketh their
Loss and Hurt, rather than their Benefit,
because he would reclaim them from their
Lusts. These reject all Admonitions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
obstinate &amp; impenitent in their Sins.</p>
                  <p>2. The Offence with Discouragement:
When Men are staggered in their Hope
and Obedience: Troubles are distastful
to the Flesh, which seeketh its own ease:
Some are discouraged in a greater, some in
a lesser degree; Heb. 12. 3.—<hi>Lest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e
wax weary, and faint in your minds.</hi> Weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is a lesser degree of deficiency, Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
a greater. These Terms are transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the Body to the Mind.</p>
                  <p>2. There is an Offence of Ignorance,
and an Offence of Malice and Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>1. The Offence of Ignorance and
Weakness: When Men are carried with
a blind Zeal.—<hi>I verily thought that I ought
to do many things against Iesus of</hi> Nazareth,
<hi>saith</hi> Paul, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 9. Men of a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
Conscience, are like a blind Horse
full of Mettle, but ever and anon stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.
But this is more pardonable, 1 <hi>Tim.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64994:124"/>
1. 13. Who was before a Blasphemer, and a
Persecutor, and Injurious; but I obtained,
Mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. There is the Offence of Malice and
Opposition, when Men err, not only in
their Minds, but in their Hearts; do not
know, and do not desire to know; they
would not know what they know, and
are willingly ignorant; <hi>Nolentes audire,
quod auditum damnare non possunt,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Tertul. in Apol.</hi> They have not a mind to
know, that which they have not a mind
to do. They would not know the Truth,
because they have a mind to hate it; this
is spoken of, <hi>Acts 13. 45. They were filled
with Envy, and spake against those things
which were spoken by</hi> Paul, contradicting
and blaspheming: This is malice; Men
first hate, then persecute and oppose the
Truth. Conviction choak'd with Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,
breaketh out into rage against that
way they were convinced of, or the Light
of which they cannot rationally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand:
<hi>Herod</hi> taketh offence against <hi>Iohn</hi>
Baptist, whom he formerly liked, and
then beheadeth him. Light resisted, or
not kindly used, maketh a Man turn De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
that he may the more deface all feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64994:125"/>
of Conscience: This is the malignity
of Revolters, <hi>Hosea</hi> 5. 5. they will hear
nothing to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>3. There is a Total, and there is a
Partial Offence: The Total Offence is,
when Men will give Christ no place in
their Hearts, but remain in their Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
John 8. 24. <hi>Because ye believe not that
I am he, ye shall die in your sins.</hi> When
they will take no warning, they shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
for despising the Remedy. The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Offence is, when they do not receive
all of Christ, though they may be sound
in the Main: these are those that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
speaks of, <hi>That they are saved as by
Fire,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. Some Doctrine or
Practice wherein they allow themselves,
may prove false and unchristian; yet the
Man may be mercifully dealt with by
Christ, and freed from having his Portion
with Unbelievers; yet it goeth hard with
him: as one involved in a common Fire
hardly escapeth out of it, their Salvation
is more difficult. In short, every one is
more happy, as he is less apt to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Christ; but they are most unhappy,
that are most offended in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="241" facs="tcp:64994:125"/>I now come to shew you,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> How it is true, that those that
escape this Sin, are in the ready way to
Salvation.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer:</p>
                  <p>1. The Negative includeth the Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and must be thus explained: He that
is not offended, but evangelized, hath
the Power and Vertue of the Gospel
stamped upon his Heart. <hi>Blessed is he!</hi>
Among them that are offended, some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
and fall off from Christ, others ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come at him: But these believe, so as
to be changed and converted. Nothing
hindereth them, when Christ hath gained
their liking and esteem; for this esteem
that we speak of now, is not a simple spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
Approbation; (for that may be,
and no change follow; Rom. 2. 18. <hi>Thou
approvest the things that are excellent);</hi> but
a practical comparative approbation, all
things considered, Christ is best for their
turns: always a change followeth this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem;
Phil. 3. 8. <hi>I count all things but
loss, for the excellency of the knowledg of
Christ Iesus my Lord.</hi> And till we have
this esteem, there is some secret Offence
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64994:126"/>
that we take at Christ, either at his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Doctrine, Precepts, or the bad en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment
they have in the World; and
for the contrarie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y of our Affections,
Christ and we do not close with full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
and delight.</p>
                  <p>2. This esteem produceth an uniform
Obedience: For they that thus esteem
Christ, will study to please him: Delight
in our Master, breedeth delight in our
Work: Col. 1. 10. <hi>That ye might walk
worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being
fruitful in every good Work, and increasing
in the Knowledg of God.</hi> And, 1 <hi>Thess.
2. 12. That ye would walk worthy of God,
who hath called you unto his Kingdom and
Glory.</hi> The only way to know whether
we be more or less offended in Christ, is
to compare our Conversation and Practice
with his Precepts: His Benefits commend
themselves to our Affections, his Precepts
to our Consciences; the one sweeten the
other. We have such a good Master, we
can never do enough for him. If we like
Christ, nothing will be grievous that he
giveth us in charge; 1 John 5. 3.—<hi>His
Commandments are not grievous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. When we are not offended in
Christ, we are the better fortified against
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64994:126"/>
Temptations to Apostacy: They are of
three sorts; <hi>Errors, Scandals, Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Errors: Many are drawn away with
vain Pretences, <hi>But we have an unction
from the Holy One, and know all things,</hi>
John 2. 20. But they are an offence,
not only of Seduction, but Contristation
<hi>Rom. 16. 17. Mark them which cause
Errors and Offenses, contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
which ye have learned, and avid
them;</hi> these are Wens of Christ's Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Body, not Parts. Errors in the Church,
breed Atheism in the World. Many que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
the Ways of God, and give over all
Religion; because there are so many Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
and Sects, therefore they think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
certain. Certainly God saw this
Discipline to be fittest for his People; he
hath told us, <hi>there must be Errors;</hi> he
would not have us to take up Religion
upon trust, without the pains of Study
and Prayer. Lazy Men would fain give
Laws to Heaven, and teach God how to
govern the Affairs of the World, they
would have all things clear and plain, that
there should be no doubt about it. But
the Lord in his wise Providence seeth it
fit to permit these things, <hi>That they which
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:64994:127"/>
are approved, may be made manifest.</hi> To
excuse the trouble of a Search, Study,
and Prayer, Men would have all things
agreed, else they take offence at Religion,
and that is one means to draw them off,
even after profession. The Canonists
say, <hi>Non fuisset discretus Dominus Deus,
nisi unum consti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uerit Vniversalem Iudicem.</hi>
This was their Blasphemy, that God were
not discreet and wise, unless he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
one Universal and Infallible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter.
This is Mens natural thoughts;
the Jews say, That Christ was not the
True Messiah: Why? Because if he had
been, he would not have come in such a
way as to leave any of his Country-men
in doubt; but would so plainly have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
himself, that all might know
him: So many think Religion is but a
Fancy, and so fall off to Atheism and
Sceptieism at last, and irresolution in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
because there are so many Sects
and Divisions, and all upholding it with
plausible pretences. And to excuse Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Prejudice, Men pretend want of
certainty: But God's Word is plain to all
that will do his Will, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 17.</p>
                  <p>2. The scandalous a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vil Practices of
Professors: These do not only infect but
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:64994:127"/>
offend many, and cause them to stumble
at Religion, or fall into a dislike of the
Way of Salvation. Scandal is far more
dangerous than Persecution: In Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though many be discouraged, yet
others are gained to a liking of Religion:
There are many that have been gained by
the patience, courage, and constancy of
the Martyrs, but never any were gained
by the scandalous falls of Professors: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions
do only work upon our Heart,
which may be allayed by proposal of the
Crown of Life: But by scandalous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
how many settle into a resolved hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Heart? In Crosses and Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
many Men may have a secret liking of
the Truth, and a purpose to own it in
better times: But by this kind of scandal,
Men grow into an open and professed
dislike thereof. In Persecutions, there is
not a dislike of Religion it self, but of
the hard terms upon which it must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:
But by Scandals, Men dislike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
it self, and nourish a base and vile
Opinion thereof in their Hearts, and so
they grow loose and fall off. And this
mischief doth not only prevail with the
lighter sort of Christians, but many times
those which have had some taste, it makes
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:64994:128"/>
them fly off exceedingly; <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 7.
There will be Offences, <hi>but wo unto them
by whom they come.</hi> Christ hath told us,
all will not walk up to the Religion they
own: But a Man that is not offended in
Christ, will not be offended at the Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of those that profess his Way: 1 <hi>Ioh.
2. 10. He that loveth his Brother, abideth
in the Light, and there is no occasion of
stumbling in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>im.</hi> All things that offend,
will not be taken away till the Reapers
come: Matth. 13. 41. <hi>The Son of Man
shall send forth his Angels, and they shall
gather out of his Kingdom all things that
offend, and them which do iniquity.</hi> In the
mean time, he that loveth Christ, and
loveth his Brother, dareth not reason
from some to all, from Persons to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
for Religion is not to be judged
by the Persons that profess it, but the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
by the Religion. These things must
ever be distinguished, the Rule and the
Practice, the Form and the Power: The
Form, Manner, or Model of Truth, may
be compleat, though the virtue of this
Religion doth not prevail over all those
that come under the profession of it. 'Tis
against all Reason, that the excellency of
Christ should stand to the courtesy of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:64994:128"/>
Man's Obedience: The Art is not to be
judged by the bungling of the Artist.
And then for the other, The Love of the
Brethren will not permit them, that they
should judg of all the rest by a few, and
those the worser part: This is, as if a
Man should judg of a Street by the Sink
or Kennel, or throw away the whole clus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or bunch of Grapes, for one or two
rotten ones. Shall the Apostles be judged
of by <hi>Iudas?</hi> or the good Angels by the
Bad? or <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family by <hi>Ishmael?</hi>
If some make shipwrack of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
others keep up the Honour and
Majesty of Religion, as well as they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
it.</p>
                  <p>3. The troublesome Poverty, and mean
outside of those that profess the Gospel,
and their many Troubles and Calamities:
As in Christ's time, the Grandees and
learned Rabbies, did not own Christ.
<hi>Have any of the Pharisees or Rulers believed
in him?</hi> That is, Persons of eminency and
place. <hi>Celsus</hi> the Heathen maketh the
Objection, Should a few Mariners, (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fisher-men) prescribe to the World?
But God never intended that Truth
should be known by Pomp, nor condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or disallowed for Troubles that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:64994:129"/>
it: The drift of Christianity, is
to take us off from the hopes and fears of
the present World; therefore he that liketh
Christ and his Promises, is not likely to
be separated from him by Persecution,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>7. He is held to him, not only
by the Head, but by the Heart.</p>
                  <p>Now the use that we should make of
this, is Caution: Take heed of being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
in Christ.</p>
                  <p>I shall, 1. shew you who are in danger
of it.</p>
                  <p>2. I shall shew you the hainousness of
it.</p>
                  <p>3. What we should do to avoid it.</p>
                  <p>1. Who are in danger of it? I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;</p>
                  <p>(1.) All such as are hardned in malice
and opposition, against those that profess
Godliness; and have a male Talent against
Strictness, and are glad when it meeteth
with any trouble or disgrace: The clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Evidence will not convince these Men.
Such were the froward obstinate Jews,
who were hardned, and believed not, but
spake evil of that way, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 9. Again,
There are some that are more moderate,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:64994:129"/>
but are discouraged in their first attempts
of a godly Life, and so give over through
despondency. The Bullock is most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
at the first yoaking: The Fire at first
kindling casts forth most smoke; this
they cannot bear, therefore give it over
as hopeless. And then partly, the insin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
whose League with their Lusts was
never dissolved. And again, weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
who are not fortified and rooted
in the Love of God, and the Faith and
Hope of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>2. I shall shew you the hainousness
of it.</p>
                  <p>(1.) 'Tis unreasonable; whatsoever
hindreth any Man from coming to Christ,
or embracing the Gospel, 'tis an Offence
not given, but taken. There is nothing
in Christ to make us stumble, and be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at him; Jer. 2. 5. <hi>What Iniquity
have your Fathers found in me, that they
are gone far from me, and have walked
after Vanity, and are become vain?</hi> But
every thing that may draw our desire or
delight towards him; yet by Mens blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and ignorance, 'tis very frequent;
Luke 19. 42. <hi>They do not know the things
which belong to their peace, in this their
day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:64994:130"/>(2.) 'Tis very natural; we are apt to
set stumbling-blocks in our own way, and
matter of offence before our own feet.
And take up every obvious pretence to
excuse our selves to our selves, from heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the Offers of the Gospel: Flesh
and Blood will stumble in God's plainest
ways; Hosea 14. 9. <hi>The ways of the Lord
are right; the Iust shall walk therein, but
the Transgressors shall fall in them.</hi> They
will count every Mole-hill a Mountain,
and offended at every thing which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
God, and their Duty and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to him.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>A prejudicate Opinion and Malice is
always apt to pick quarrels at Truth and
Goodness; Acts</hi> 17. 5, 6. The Iews which
believed not, moved with Envy, took unto
them certain lude Fellows of the baser sort,
and gathered a Company, and set all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
on an uproar, and assaulted the House of
<hi>Jason,</hi> and sought to bring them out to the
People: and when they found them not, they
drew <hi>Jason,</hi> and certain Brethren, unto the
Rulers of the City, crying, These which have
turned the World upside down, are come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
also. <hi>So,</hi> Chap. 18. 6. They opposed
themselves, and blasphemed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:64994:130"/>4. 'Tis a dangerous Sin: If we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to be offended in Christ, Christ will
be offended at us at the last day. We
get nothing by dashing against the Corner-Stone,
we hurt not Christ, but our selves.
<hi>Mat. 21. 44. Whosoever shall fall on this
Stone, shall be broken: but on whomsoever it
shall fall, it will grind him to pouder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. What shall we do to avoid it?</p>
                  <p>1. Get a clear Understanding, or a
Zeal according to Knowledg; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 2.
and <hi>Iohn 9. 39. For judgment I am come
into the World, that they which see not, might
see, and they which see, might be made blind.</hi>
This will be the effect of my coming,
that the Ignorant will be enlightned, and
learned Men will not see the things before
their eyes; they were hardned and left to
their own prejudices.</p>
                  <p>2. Get a good measure to mete things
withal. The Jews were offended in
Christ, because they were leavened with a
notion of a pompous <hi>Messiah;</hi> and so
judged of all things concerning Christ,
as they suited with that conceit: So <hi>Iohn
7. 24. Iudg not according to appearance, but
judg righteous Iudgment.</hi> We judg ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to appearance, but judg not
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:64994:131"/>
righteous Judgment: This is no good
measure, but an Idol of our Hearts. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are in an evil way, but yet want not
their pretences: As the Tradition of the
Elders, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 2. And Succession,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 33. The Novelty of Christ's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;
<hi>Mark 1. 27. What new Doctrine
is this?</hi> The vile abject condition of Christ
and his Disciples: They never enter into
the merits of the Cause, but determine
it by prejudicate Opinions: A good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
therefore is necessary; there is <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sura
mensurans,</hi> and <hi>mensura mensurata,</hi>
a measure measuring, and the measure that
is measured; the measure that is measured,
is an upright unbiassed Mind.</p>
                  <p>3. Labour to get a mortified Heart:
They are most apt to be scandalized, that
have a carnal biass upon their Hearts, a
contrariety of affections to the Gospel,
<hi>Luke 16. 14. Iohn</hi> 5. 44. and <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 42,
43. who are leavened with covetousness,
jealousy of reputation, fear of disgrace,
and the like.</p>
                  <p>4. Get a fervent Love: Psal. 119. 165.
<hi>Great peace have they which love thy Law,
and nothing shall offend them.</hi> 'Tis want of
a true and hearty love that maketh us so
easy and apt to take offence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:64994:131"/>A secoud use that we make of it is this,
Be sure to take heed of Prejudices against
practical Godliness.</p>
                  <p>1. Some take prejudice against the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Regeneration: But surely there is
a necessity of fitting us anew to the use
and end for which we were made: For
the <hi>Vse,</hi> see <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 10. and for the End,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 3. from the third to the fifth verse.</p>
                  <p>2. Another prejudice is, the difficulty
of a godly life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 25. With Men
it is impossible, but with God all things
are possible; use will make it easy; at first
it is most hard and tedious.</p>
                  <p>3. Another Prejudice, is the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which attend it: God will have his
Servants and Graces tried. They that go
to Sea, must look for Wind and Waves;
but in the Haven we shall have rest: In
Heaven we shall injoy full and eternal rest.</p>

                  <p>IN this Context, Christ had likened the
People of the Generation in which
he lived, to Boys playing in the
Streets, and personating (as Children
are given to imitate what they have seen
in Elder Persons) sometimes Festivities,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64994:133"/>
acting the part of a Musician, but their

acting the part of the Mourning Women
who were to weep for the dead, cry, Ah, my

that they would do nothing as they should,
neither follow them in their Mirth, nor
sadness. So the people of that Generation,
whatsoever Messages God sent unto them,
they accepted them not and obeyed them
not. Some great Exceptions they had

kind of Exception they have to <hi>Iohn,</hi> and
the quite contrary to <hi>Iesus;</hi> and so they

that he was so austere. But Christ, that
was gentle and affable, they censure him
as a loose Person, or favorer of such. <hi>For Iohn

                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:64994:133"/>In the words, three Things are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The different Form and Course of
Life wherein <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</item>
                     <item>2. Their Censures both of <hi>Iohn</hi> and
<hi>Iesus.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. The receiving of the Gospel by the
unprejudiced.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. The different Course of Life where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> appeared: <hi>Iohn came
neither eating, nor drinking:</hi> that is, lived
in a strict austere Course of Life, not
after the ordinary Diet of Men; for we
read he had his Raiment of Camels Hair,
and a leathern Girdle about his Loins, and
his Meat was Locusts and wild Hony:
But the Son of Man came eating and
drinking, that is, using the ordinary Diet
of Men, and eating promiscuously with
all company, in a more free use of the
Creatures, taking the fare as he found it,
and conversing with all sorts of Men in a
familar Course of Life: Sometimes with
Publicans, as <hi>Zacheus:</hi> sometimes with
Pharisees, as <hi>Simon,</hi> Luke 7. He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:64994:134"/>
no such abstinency, but ate Meats
indifferently: sometimes he had nothing
but barely Bread and Water; sometimes
he was at Feasts, and using Wine, and
conversed with Men indifferently.</p>
                  <p>2. Their Censures both of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and
<hi>Iesus:</hi> John <hi>hath a Devil;</hi> that is, he is a
Person possessed, out of his wits: For
the Jews ascribed all Distempers to the
Devil. And of Christ, their censure was,
<hi>That he was a Glutton, and a Friend of
Publicans and Sinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The reciving of the Gospel by the
unprejudiced; <hi>But Wisdom is justified of
her Children.</hi> This last clause, needeth
opening; that we may know what is
Wisdom, who are her Children, and
how they justify it.</p>
                  <p>1. By Wisdom is meant, the Doctrine
of the Gospel, called elsewhere, The
Counsel of God; as appeareth by the
parallel place, <hi>Luke 7. 29, 30. And all the
People that heard him, and the Publicans,
justified God, being baptized with the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
of</hi> John: <hi>But the Pharisees and
Lawyers rejected the Counsel of God against
themselves.</hi> The Gospel is called Wisdom,
because 'tis the result of God's eternal
Wisdom. The Doctrine of Christ Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:64994:134"/>
is called, <hi>The Wisdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor.
1. 22. And again, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 7. The Wisdom
of God in a Mystery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The Children of Wisdom, are the
Professors of it: 'Tis an Hebraism; <hi>As
Children of</hi> Corath; <hi>Children of Light;
Children of this World,</hi> &amp;c. the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors,
and Followers of the Gospel.
Wisdom hath her Children; all are not
alike indisposed, some are begotten to God
by the Doctrine of Grace.</p>
                  <p>3. Justified. As this is opposed to Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
so to justify, is the work of an
Advocate. As it is opposed to Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
so 'tis the work of a Judg. Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom's
Children will bear witness to their
Faith, or the Doctrine of God by their
Profession, and Godly Life, and ready
Obedience: And exalt it as much as
others decry it, and every way manifest
that they hold it for good and right.</p>
                  <p>Many Points might be observed
hence: As,</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>That God sendeth forth his Servants with
divers dispositions:</hi> Some more austere in
Life, others more social in their Carriage:
some sad and mournful, others chearful
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64994:135"/>
and pleasant: some more thundring in
Doctrine, others more gently inducing
people to Repentance. Since God maketh
use of variety of Gifts and Tempers;
Let us observe this Wisdom, not bring all
to the Law of some admired Instance
and Example: As there is a difference
of Stomachs, some for Meats baked, or
roasted, others for boiled; so God fits his
Servants severally to do good, as the
Persons they are to treat with need.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>That Men are qualified according to
the dispensation wherein God useth them:
Iohn,</hi> as a Preacher of Repentance, was
austere: Christ, as a giver of Pardon,
mild and affable: <hi>Iohn</hi> was to come in
the Spirit and Power of <hi>Elias;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to imitate him in his Course of Life:
He was sent forth to raise and awaken a
sleepy World, besotted in security: But
Christ who was to come with the glad
Tydings of Salvation, and to call Sinners
to Grace and Pardon, chose to appear in
a meek, sweet, and social way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
that his Benignity in drawing the
most grievous Sinners to himself, might
thereby be manifested.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>That Men are apt to complain, quarrel,
and except against what is done by God, and
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:64994:135"/>
whatsoever Methods are used to reduce them
to a sence of their Duty.</hi> Both <hi>Iohn</hi> and
Jesus were sent by God, but Men have
ever somewhat to say: <hi>Iohn</hi> is too rough
and austere; and Christ too sociable, and
familiar with Sinners: They dislike the
Severity of the one, and the free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
of the other. So in other Cases, old
Men, they say, <hi>dote;</hi> young Men are too
rash: some they find fault with, because
they are so facil and easy; with others,
because they are obscure and deep:
People are always unsatisfied.</p>
                  <p>4. That neither the Severity of the Law,
nor the glad Tydings of Salvation, will
of themselves work upon Men, unless God
set in by his Spirit: <hi>For both the Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of Iohn and Jesus was without its
effect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Though some obstinately refuse the
Gospel, yet others accept of it, and live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly:</hi>
Wisdom hath her Children,
who justify and defend her ways as much
as others impugn and oppose them, <hi>Acts</hi>
17. 34. God seldom lighteth a Candle,
but he hath some lost Groat to seek.</p>
                  <p>All these Points might be profitably
insisted on: But I shall make use of this
Text, to give you this Observation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:64994:136"/>That Iesus Christ, when he came to set up
the Gospel, did not tie himself to a
Wilderness-life of austerity in total ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence
from common Meat and
Wine, as <hi>John</hi> the Baptist did, and
as they thought that he that professed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Sanctity should have done.</p>
                  <p>In the prosecution of this Point, I shall
use this Method.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. I shall shew you, That the Censures
of the two Things disliked in Christ,
were not just.</item>
                     <item>2. Give you the Reasons why he lived,
and chose this form and sort of
Life.</item>
                     <item>3. The profitable Observations that
we may build thereon.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. That the Censures of the two things
disliked in Christ, were not just. The
two things disliked in Christ were;
<list>
                        <item>(1.) His Diet.</item>
                        <item>(2.) His Company.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>(1.) His Diet: <hi>He came eating and
drinking:</hi> He did eat and drink as other
Men, but with great piety, and with
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:64994:136"/>
great temperance and soberity. His Piety
was remarkable, <hi>Iohn 6. 11. And Iesus
took the Loaves, and when he had given
Thanks, he distributed them among the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>
And, <hi>vers.</hi> 23.—<hi>Nigh unto the
place were they had eaten Bread, after the
Lord gave Thanks.</hi> All our Refreshments
should be sanctified; They are great
Mercies, though ordinary: They come
down from Heaven, and direct us to seek
the Blessing thence, from whence we
have the Comforts themselves: Though
we have but slender provisions, we
should be thankful: Christ gave Thanks
for five Barley Loaves and two Fishes.
Mark, here he doth not mention the
Miracle, but the Thanksgiving. Christ
had expressed himself in such a way, as
made deep Impression on the standers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
and would fully convince us, that the
blessing of all Injoyments is in God's Hand.</p>
                  <p>(2.) His Temperance and Sobriety is
observable; Five Barley Loaves, and two
Fishes were carried about, as the standing
Provision for Himself and Family, <hi>Luke</hi>
9. 13. Christ's Provision is such as may
teach sobriety and contentment with a
mean condition unto all: At another
time he beggeth a draught of Water
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:64994:137"/>
to quench his Thirst, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 7. And
therefore the Exceptions against his Diet
were not just.</p>
                  <p>2. Against his Company: They accused
him of eating with Publicans and Sinners,
in the Text. So <hi>Luke 15. 2. This Man
receiveth Sinners, and eateth with them:</hi>
Because he went to them as a Physician to
heal their Souls, <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 30. He conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with the meanest, and refused not
familiarity with the poorest and worst, as
was needful for their Cure. The Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees
thought it to be against all Decorum,
that he would spake and converse with all
sorts of People, Publicans and Harlots
not excepted: But Christ coming to save
all sorts of People, it was necessary that he
should Converse with all sorts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>2. The Reasons why he lived, and
chose this sort of Life.</p>
                  <p>1. Because he would not place Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in outward Austerities and Observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
Men superstitiously appoint to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unnecessary Tasks, and, forbid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
many lawful Things, and this they
call by the name of Holiness. When
Satan who is usually a Libertine, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:64994:137"/>
to be a Saint; He will be stricter
than Christ Himself: As the Pharisees
were in the choice of their Company and
outward Observances. Christ foresaw
this Spirit would be working in the
World: <hi>Touch not, taste not, handle not,
after the Commandments and Doctrines of
Men,</hi> Col. 2. 21, 22. That Men were
apt to place Religion in a simple absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
from the common Comforts of
Life, under a pretence of more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
mortification: neither eat, nor
taste, nor touch: over-doing in Externals,
is usually an undoing in Religion: The
<hi>Quaker</hi>'s Spirit, and the Monkish Spirit,
is an Apochryphal and bastard sort of
Holiness, a Spirit that suiteth not with the
Temper of the Gospel, and the example
of Christ.</p>
                  <p>2. Christ would live a strict, but soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and charitable Life, and did not
observe the Laws of proud Pharisaical se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
but spent his time in doing good,
and healing all manner of bodily Diseases,
and instructing the Souls of Men upon all
occasions: There is a disposition in Men
by a foolish singularity, to stand aloof
from others: The Prophet toucheth it,
<hi>Isa. 65. 5. They said, Stand by thy self,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:64994:138"/>
come not near me, for I am holier than thou.</hi>
Some then, though impure and prophane,
would seem holier than others, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all unclean and polluted besides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
This Spirit rested in the Pharisees
in Christ's time, <hi>Luke 5. 30. The Scribes
and Pharisees murmured against his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
saying, Why do you eat and drink with
Publicans and Sinners?</hi> So, <hi>Luke 7. 39. If
this Man had been a Prophet, he would
have known who, and what manner of
Woman this is that toucheth him; for she is a
Sinner.</hi> And afterwards the whole Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Jews were possessed with this
Spirit, and would not endure that any
should converse with the Gentiles, as
fearing to be defiled by them. Now Jesus
Christ would not countenance this inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Spirit; coming to do good to all,
he would converse with all.</p>
                  <p>3. Jesus Christ coming into the World
as to redeem us to God, so to set us an
example, would take up that course of
Life which was most imitable by all sorts
of Persons, and calculated as for the
Honour of God, so for the Benefit of
Humane Society. He intended his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
not only for Recluses and Votaries,
but for Men of all Conditions, Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:64994:138"/>
and Employments: and therefore would
not fright us from Religion by affected
Austerities, but invite us to it by a sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
converse with all kind of Companies:
And no Man now can excuse himself,
saying, That he cannot imitate the form
of Christ's Living, since it is competent to
all kind of Persons, even those who are
not shut up, but whose Callings ingage
them to be abroad in the World: For
'tis Religion that puts us upon the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of all Duties to God and Man:
The sum of it is comprised in the Love of
God above all, and our Neighbour as
our selves. We love all, even Enemies,
with that common Love which is due to
Humanity; and all that fear God with
a special Love. Now this may be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the Shop, better than in the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
and solitudes; and where-ever we
go, we may go about doing good: And
this may be done by all sorts of Persons,
Princes, and Peasants, Noble-men or
Tradesmen, as well as Ministers and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of a more retired Life.</p>
                  <p>4. Coming into the World, to set up
the Kingdom of God, it was sit his Form
of Life should suit with the Nature of
that Kingdom. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist telleth them,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:64994:139"/>
                     <hi>The Kingdom of God is at hand;</hi> and
Christ himself, That the Kingdom of God
was come, and was among them. Now
what is the nature of this Kingdom of
God? The Apostle telleth you, that,
<hi>Rom. 14. 17. The Kingdom of God stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not in Meat and Drink, but in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
and Peace, and Ioy in the Holy
Ghost.</hi> There are two expositions of that
place, and both equally probable; the
one more general, the other more limited
and restrained to the Context: More ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
That Righteousness is taken for all
new Obedience, and Peace for peace of
Conscience, resulting from the rectitude
of our Actions; and joy in the Holy
Ghost, for that supernatural comfort which
the Holy Ghost puts into our Hearts, by
reflecting upon our Privileges in Christ,
and the Hopes of the World to come.
Now Christianity consists not in eating,
or not eating such or such Meats, or such
kind of Observances, but in solid Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or in the practice of Christian Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Vertues. The more limited sense
is, That by Righteousness is meant just
dealings; by Peace, a peaceable, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
inoffensive sort of living; by Joy in
the Holy Ghost, a delight to do good to
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:64994:139"/>
one another; to advance and build up
one another in Godliness, not dividing,
hating, excommunicating, censuring one
another for lesser Things and meer Ritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
but pleasing our Neighbour to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 2. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31, 32,
33. <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever
ye do, do all to the glory of God: give no
offence, neither to Iews nor Gentiles, nor to
the Church of God: even as I please all men
in all things, not seeking my own profit, but
the profit of many, that they may be saved.</hi>
This meek, holy, charitable converse to
the Glory of God, without offence and
scandal, is that which promoteth God's
Kingdom: And this would Christ teach us
in his own form and course of Life, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
in a sanctified manner with all
sorts of Persons to their profit and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>
                  <p>5. Because Christ would not gratify
Humane Wisdom: As he would not grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
Sense, by chusing a pompous Life; so he
would not gratify Humane Wisdom, by
chusing an austere Life. There are two
sorts of Men in the World who are not
of God; the Men of the World, and the
Saints of this World. The Men of the
World are brutish Sensualists, who are all
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:64994:140"/>
for Pomp and Glory, Christ would not
gratify these, but came meek and poor, to
teach us Humility, Self-denial, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation;
Mat. 11. 29. <hi>Learn of me, for
I am meek and lowly in heart.</hi> He did not
bustle in the World for Respect and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
His Complaints of his Enemies, and
his Answers to them, were full of Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and stood not to abase himself for
the Father's Glory and Mens Good: so he
did not gratify the <hi>Men</hi> of the World.
The <hi>Saints</hi> of this World are such as are
strict in outward Observances, in eating or
not eating, in marrying or not marrying,
in forbearing such Company, in such a
number and tale of Devotions; in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining
from such lawful things: These
things the Apostle saith <hi>have a shew of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
Col. 2. 23. The World is mightily
taken with bodily Exercise, and outward
Strictness: As the Men of the World love
to pamper the Body, so the Saints of this
World needlesly afflict and dishonour the
Body: This hath a shew, and nothing but
a shew; but Christ would not gratify
these neither; he used a free, but an holy
Life, and so was censured and traduced
as a Wine-bibber and a Glutton, to teach
his Followers to be contented to be judged
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:64994:140"/>
according to Men in the Flesh, and live
to God in the Spirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 6. He
came to preach, and to give inward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
and Renovation. To shew
the proper way of Mortification, which
is not by a severity of Life, but by dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the mind to the esteem of the World.
That kind of Life which consists in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Rigors, hath some honour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in the World, and maketh a fair
shew in the Flesh; but he would teach us
the Life which consists in Faith, Holiness,
Sobriety, Humility of Mind, Charity,
Obedience to God, Joy in the Spirit, and
comfort of the Promises, which the World
liketh not so well; outward and rigorous
Observances are more plausible, but the
Power of Godliness, and a true sense of
the World to come, the World hateth.</p>
                  <p>6. To shew us the true nature of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
which consists not in a bare ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence,
and shameful retreat from Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
but in a Spirit fortified against
them: not in a monkish discontent with
the World, but an holy contempt of it
when we most freely use it. And in brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and governing the Appetite and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
rather than in scrupulous refraining
from the Object it self. In an using of the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:64994:141"/>
World, but not abusing of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31.
Not so much scrupling the Comforts of the
present Life, as a valuing and esteeming
the Comforts of a better Life; prising
more the Christian Vow, than any by-Laws
of our own. The Apostle telleth
us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. That bodily Exercise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth
little, but Godliness is profitable to
all things. Abstinence from daily Meats,
Wines, Marriage, is an act of Self-denial,
but a very small one; for all the good it
doth, is to tame the Members of the Body,
and its external Motions and Actions,
without sanctifying the Heart and inward
part, as a lively Faith, Fear and Love of
God doth. The profit of bodily Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
is little in comparison of inward Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which is necessary to a comfortable
Life here, and a blessed hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Observations which we
may build thereon.</p>
                  <p>1. We may observe the Humanity,
Goodness, and Kindness of that Religion
which we do profess, both with respect to
our selves and others.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Our Selves. Man consists of a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and a Soul, and hath respects for either,
else he were unnatural: The Body indeed
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:64994:141"/>
we are apt to overprize, and therefore we
need not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>pur but a Bridle for our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to the bodily life. And therefore
Religion, in the Precepts of it, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
by way of restraint, rather than
exhortation; Titus 2. 12. <hi>That we should
live soberly,</hi> &amp;c. And, <hi>Rom. 13. 14. Make
no provision for the Flesh, to fulfil the Lusts
thereof.</hi> Do not cherish carnal Desires.
The Apostle telleth you, <hi>No Man ever yet
hated his own Flesh,</hi> Ephes. 5. 29. <hi>but nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth
and cherisheth it.</hi> Our usual fault is,
an excessive pampering of the Flesh:
Some have hated their own Souls, at least
by consequence and interpretation; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we dare not let loose the Reins, and
give either incouragement or allowance to
Men to indulge their carnal Desires; yet
to avoid prejudice, we must grant what
may be granted: for Men are apt to think
that Religion is a sower thing, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridges
them of all the Comforts of their
lives. No, besides the rich Comforts it
provideth for the Soul, it alloweth and
forbiddeth not so much sensitive pleasure,
as tendeth to the holiness of the Soul, and
furthereth us in God's Service: It rebuk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

present World, as they have respect to
God and a better World, and as they
help and hinder us in the pleasing God,
and seeking Immortality.</p>
                  <p>(2.) With respect to others. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of our Religion may be known by the
Example of our dearest Lord: 'Tis not a
proud disdainful Spirit that refuseth the
company of the meanest and worst, so
we may do them good: He came to save
Sinners, and conversed with Sinners: He
came to redress the miseries of Mankind,
and went up and down doing good; tho
his familiarities were with the most godly,
yet he disdained not the company of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
And surely his Religion, where it
prevaileth in the Hearts of any, it causes
them not only to deal justly with all, but
to love all, all Mankind, with a love of
Benevolence; it maketh us to long for
the good of their Souls, and desirous also
to do good to the Bodies of those that are
in need. 'Tis said indeed, <hi>Prov. 29. 27.
An unjust Man is an abomination to the just:
and he that is upright in the way, is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
to the wicked.</hi> But we must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
of the hatred of Abomination,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:64994:142"/>
and the hatred of Enmity: We hate our
sinful Neighbour, as we must our selves
much more, in opposition to the love of
Complacency, but not in opposition to
the love of Benevolence; so we must
neither hate our selves, nor our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
no nor our Enemy. The business
of your lives must be, to do good to all,
especially to the Houshold of Faith: God's
Natural Image is on all Men, his Spiritual
Image on his Saints: and we must love
God in all his Creatures, especially in his
Children. This is true Religion, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
by our Lord's Example.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> We may observe, That an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Holiness, which consisteth in an
outside strictness, without that Faith, Love,
Charity, Hope, usefulness and activity
which is the very soul and life of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
usually puffeth up Men with a
vain conceit of their own Righteousness,
and a censuring and a despising of others.
This Text sheweth us both the Spirit of
Pharisaism, and the Spirit of Christianity.
The Pharisees who abounded in outward
Observances, censured Christ for his free
Converses, and disdained those Sinners
whom he invited to a better life, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:64994:143"/>
9, 10, 11, 12. And they were ignorant
of true Wisdom, which is justified, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
and received by all her Children.
Learn then, that an unruly, fierce, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorious
Spirit, which is only born up by
external advantages, is not the right Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Gospel. True Religion maketh
men humble and low in their own eyes,
acquainteth them with their Desert, Sin,
and Misery, and maketh them pitiful and
compassionate to others, and more ready
to help them, than to censure them, and
to use all ways and means to do them
good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The main Observation is this,
That a free Life, guided by an holy
Wisdom, is the most sanctified Life, and
bringeth most honour to God, and is most
useful to others.</p>
                  <p>Here I shall shew you,</p>
                  <p>1. Wherein lieth this free <hi>life</hi> guided
by holy Wisdom.</p>
                  <p>2. How it is the most sanctified <hi>life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Wherein lieth this free <hi>life</hi> guided
by holy Wisdom. 'Tis said of <hi>Enoch,</hi>
Gen. 5. 22. <hi>That he walked with God, and
begat Sons and Daughters:</hi> that is, dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himself to God's Service, and lived in
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:64994:143"/>
most strict Holiness. And there you see
the use of a conjugal <hi>life</hi> in its purity, may
stand with the strictest Rules of Holiness.
So for worldly Affairs, when the course
of our calling ingageth us in them, 'tis
not using of the World, but over-using
is the fault, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31. So for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of this <hi>life:</hi> Psal. 62. 10. <hi>If Riches
encrease, set not your heart upon them.</hi> The
business is not to withdraw them away,
but to withdraw the Affection. So for
the lawful Delights; there are two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams,
clogging and retrenching our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
with outward burdensome Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
or abusing our liberty to wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
Gal. 5. 13. <hi>Ye are called to liberty,
only use not your liberty as an occasion to the
Flesh.</hi> Corrupt Nature venteth it self
both ways, either by superstitious rigors,
or by breaking all Bonds, and inlarging
it self, according to the licentiousness of
the Flesh. Meat, Drink, Apparel, are
in their own nature indifferent, neither
must Superstition work upom them, nor
Profaneness, and in the mean between both
lieth Godliness.</p>
                  <p>2. How it is the most sanctified <hi>life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Partly because it suiteth with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Christ: He came as to expiate
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:64994:144"/>
our Offences, so to give us an Exsample;
1 Pet. 2. 21. <hi>Leaving us an Example, that
we should follow his steps:</hi> and, 1 <hi>Iohn 2.
6. walk as he walked.</hi> 'Tis high presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to aim at an imitation of Christ in
those acts of his, which he did for satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Father's Justice, or proving his
D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ity; yea, 'tis impossible to imitate him
in those: yet in Actions moral, we are
bound to imitate him, and in Actions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
not to suffer our Liberty to be
str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ightned, but to govern Circumstances
according to that holy Wisdom. Christ
retired not from the society of Men, but
used the greatest freedom in an holy
way.</p>
                  <p>2. Because there is more true Grace in
being dead to the Temptation, than to
retreat from the Temptation. A Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
is not to go out of the World, neither
by a voluntary Death, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 15. nor
by an unnecessary sequestration of our
selves from Business, and the Affairs which
God calleth us to: 1 Cor. 7. 20. <hi>Let
every Man abide in the same Calling where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was called.</hi> But to be crucified to
the World, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14. that's Grace to
withdraw our Hearts from the World,
while we converse in it, and with it.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:64994:144"/>
Many real Christians, when they hear us
press Mortification, and deadness to the
World, think they must leave their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
or abate of their necessary activity
in their Callings. Alas, in the Shop a
Man may<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>keep himself unspotted from
the World, as well as in the Closet; in a
Court as well in a Cell. We read of Saints
in <hi>Nero</hi>'s Houshold, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 22. he was
a great Persecutor, yet some Saints could
live there within his Gates: There were
some Professors of the Gospel. So <hi>Rev. 2.
13. I know thy Works, and where thou
dwellest, even where Satan's seat is; and
thou holdest fast my Name, and hast not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
my Faith, even in those days wherein</hi>
Antipas <hi>was my faithful Martyr, who was
slain among you where Satan dwelleth.</hi> In
the sorest and thickest of temptations, a
Christian may maintain his Integrity. In
short, our way to Heaven lieth through
the World; and tho if I be left to my
choice, I should chuse that course of <hi>life</hi>
in which there are least Temptations; yet
when God, by the posture of our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Interests, or the course of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,
or the nature of my Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and usefulness, hath determined
me to a <hi>life</hi> more incident to a throng of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:64994:145"/>
Temptations, I may the better venture
upon them, and must not leave my Service
for supposed Snares. Affectation of priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
may be a slothful retreat from publick
Business<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 'tis more glorious to beat an
Enemy, than to fly from him; and Grace
is seen in overcoming, rather than in shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Difficulties.</p>
                  <p>Well then, learn from the whole, That
true Mortification consists in a change of
the frame of Heart, in a resolution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the baits of sense, rather than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
our presence from them: in being
not of the World, tho we are in the
World: not in casting away our injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but in an equal mind in all Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>Iames</hi> 1. 9, 10. That to be poor
in Abundance, humble in high Places,
temperate and godly in the freest course
of <hi>life,</hi> is to imitate the <hi>life</hi> of Christ.
That then we are properly mortified, when
our esteem, value, and affection, is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.
That Grace sheweth it self more
in choice, than in necessity. In an absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
from the delights of the Flesh, when
we have them, rather than when we want
them: that we may follow our business,
and yet be godly; that the overcharging
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:64994:145"/>
of the Heart is the great Evil that we
should beware of; that we may use Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
but not to partake of their Sins;
yea to make them better, and to purify
them by our example.</p>
                  <p>I now proceed to the last Clause;</p>
                  <p>—But Wisdom is justified of her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p>We have observed,
<list>
                        <item>1. The different form and course of
<hi>life</hi> wherein <hi>Iohn</hi> and Jesus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</item>
                        <item>2. Their Censures of both.</item>
                        <item>3. The receiving of the Gospel by
the Unprejudiced.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this last observe;</p>
                  <p>1. The exceptive Particle <hi>[But];</hi> tho
undeserved Censures are cast upon the
Ways of God, yet at length there is a
Wisdom found in them. Ignorant Men
mistake them, carnal Men slight them, the
Prophane snuff at them; few or none en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
them with that respect they ought
to do, yet this Wisdom will not want Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="282" facs="tcp:64994:146"/>2. The thing spoken of, <hi>Wisdom.</hi> By
Wisdom is meant the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
called elsewhere the Counsel of God,
as appeareth by the parallel place, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.
29, 30. <hi>And all the People that heard him,
justified God, being baptized with the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
of</hi> John. <hi>But the Pharisees and
Lawyers rejected the Counsel of God against
themselves.</hi> The Gospel method of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is there called the Counsel of God,
because 'tis the Counsel he giveth Men for
their good; as here Wisdom, because 'tis
the result of God's eternal Wisdom and
Decrees. And elsewhere the Doctrine of
Christ crucified, is called the Wisdom of
God. And again, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 7. The Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God in a Mystery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. What is said of it, or how it is used;
'tis justified. Justification is a R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lative
word; as 'tis opposed to Crimination, so
to justify is the work of an Advocate; as
to Condemnation, so 'tis the work of a
Judg. The Children of Wisdom discharge
both parts, chiefly the first; they bear
witness to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>heir Faith, or the Doctrine of
God concerning Salvation by Christ; by
their Profession, and godly Life, and
ready Obedience; and exalt it so much as
others decry it, and every way manifest
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:64994:146"/>
they hold it for good and right; only this
pleading is real, not by Word but Deed;
<hi>Sapientia non quaerit vocis testimonium sed
operam,</hi> saith <hi>Hierom.</hi> Divine Wisdom is
justified more by Works, than by a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
Plea. Wisdom's Children hear her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
follow her Directions and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes;
and with diligence observe the
way of Salvation prescribed by God, tho
others slight it, and so justify it against
the Exceptions and Reproaches of the
carnal World.</p>
                  <p>4. Of whom; <hi>Of her Children.</hi> The
Children of Wisdom are the Professors of
it; those who are begotten by God, by
the Word of Truth, <hi>Iames</hi> 1. 18. and are
willing to attain the end, by the ways and
means wherein God affordeth it: These
are Wisdom's Children, begotten, bred
up, and instructed by her; 'tis an Hebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism,
as Children of <hi>Corah,</hi> Children of
Light, Children of this World, and the
like; the Professors and Followers of the
Gospel.</p>
                  <p>The Point that I shall insist on is this;</p>
                  <p>That the Wisdom of God, leading Men to
Salvation, in the ways and means poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:64994:147"/>
out in the Gospel, is and should be
justified of all the sincere Professors
of it.</p>
                  <p>In managing this Point, I shall shew
you,
<list>
                        <item>
                           <hi>First,</hi> What is the Wisdom of God in
the way of Salvation prescribed by
the Gospel.</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Wisdom is despised,
slighted, and contradicted by the
carnal World; and why?</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How, and why it must be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by the sincere Professors of
the Gospel.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> What is the Wisdom of God in
the way of Salvation prescribed by the
Gospel. The sum of the Gospel is this,
That all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se who by true Repentance
and Faith, do forsake the Flesh, the
World, and the Devil, and give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to God the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit, as their Creator, Redeemer, and
Sanctifier, shall find God as a Father,
taking them for his reconciled Children,
and for Christ's sake pardoning their Sins,
and by his Spirit giving them his Grace;
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:64994:147"/>
and if they persevere in this course, will
finally glorify them, and bestow upon
them everlasting Happiness; but will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the Unbelievers, Impenitent, and
Ungodly, to everlasting punishment. That
this is the sum of the Gospel, appeareth by
<hi>Mark 16. 15, 16. Go, preach the Gospel to
every Creature. He that believeth, and is
baptized, shall be saved; but he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
not, shall be damned.</hi> Where you
have all the Christian Religion laid before
you in one short view and prospect. It
concerneth either the End, or the Means.</p>
                  <p>1. The End. The Apostle telleth you,
That God hath brought Life and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
to light in the Gospel, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10.
or clearly discovered an Happiness, and
a misery in the World to come.</p>
                  <p>2. The Means. He hath pointed out
a sure way for obtaining the one, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
the other. As to the Means, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion is considerable, either as to
the entrance, or the progress of it. Our
Lord telleth us, <hi>Mat. 7. 14. Streight is the
Gate, and narrow is the Way which leadeth
unto Life.</hi> He speaketh of a Gate, and a
Way: The Gate, noteth the Entrance,
the Way, the Progress therein. In other
Scriptures we read of making Covenant
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:64994:148"/>
with God, and keeping Covenant with
God: The Covenant must not only be
made, but kept. So again we read of
Dedication and Use: of devotedness to
God, and faithfulness to him; of our Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and Progress, Choice and Course;
all which expressions tend to the same
effect.</p>
                  <p>1. As to the way of entring into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God; there is required,</p>
                  <p>(1.) True Repentance and Faith. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
towards God, and Faith in our
Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 21. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
respects God as our End, and Faith
respects Christ as Mediator, as the only
way of returning to God, from whom
we have strayed by our own folly and
sin.</p>
                  <p>(2. In the exercise of this Repentance
and Faith, there must be a forsaking the
Devil, the World, and the Flesh, and a
giving up our selves to God the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, as our Creator, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
and Sanctifier. For the former,
there are three great Enemies to God and
us, the Devil, the World, and the Flesh,
reckoned up <hi>Ephes. 2. 2, 3. In time past y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
walked according to the course of this World,
after the Prince of the Power of the Air,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:64994:148"/>
the Spirit that now worketh in the Children
of disobedience: Among whom also we all
had our conversation in times past, in the
lusts of the Flesh, fulfilling the desires of the
Flesh, and of the Mind.</hi> There all your
Enemies appear abreast; the <hi>Devil</hi> as
the grand Deceiver, and principle of all
wickedness. The <hi>World</hi> with its Pleasures,
Honours, and Profits, as the Bait by
which the Devil would deceive us, and
steal away our Hearts from God, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
us from looking after the one thing
necessary. The <hi>Flesh,</hi> as the corrupt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
in us, which entertaineth and
closeth with these Temptations, to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
of God, and wrong of our own
Souls; this is importunate to be pleased,
and is the proper internal cause of all our
mischief; for every Man is enticed and
drawn away by his own Lusts. Now
these must be renounced, before we can
return to God by Jesus Christ: for, as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
told the <hi>Israelites,</hi> so must we say to
all of you, <hi>Iosh. 24. 23. Put away the
strange Gods which are among you, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
your Heart to the Lord God of Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. There must be a renouncing of our
Idols, before our Hearts can incline unto
the true God: We must be turned from
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:64994:149"/>
Satan to God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 18. And the
World must be renounced, <hi>Titus 2. 12.
Denying all ungodliness and worldly Lusts.</hi>
And we must not look upon our selves as
Debtors to the Flesh, to fulfil the Lusts
thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10. God will have no
Copartners and Competitors in our
Hearts.</p>
                  <p>And then the second part in exercising
of our Faith and Repentance, is giving
up our selves to God the Father, Son, and
Spirit, as our Creator, Redeemer, and
Sanctifier: And therefore in Baptism,
which is our first entrance and initiation
into the Christian Religion, we are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
in the Name of the Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth
a dedication, and giving up our
selves to them, according to their perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Relations. To the <hi>Father,</hi> as our
Creator, to love him, obey him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon him, and be happy in his love
as dear Children. To <hi>Christ</hi> as our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
to free us from the guilt of Sin,
and the wrath of God. To the <hi>Holy
Ghost,</hi> to guide and sanctify us, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
us, with the sense of our present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in God's Love, and the hopes of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Glory.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to our Progress and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
which is our walking in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
way: Three things are required.
And that,</p>
                  <p>1. As to the Enemies of God and our
Souls. As there is a <hi>renouncing</hi> required
at first, so at length there is requisite an
<hi>overcoming,</hi> the Devil, the World, and
the Flesh; Rev. 2. 7. <hi>To him that overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
will I give to eat of the Tree of Life, which
is in the midst of the Paradise of God.</hi> We
overcome the Devil, when we keep up
our Resistance, and stand out against his
Batteries and Assaults; 1 Pet. 5. 8, 9. <hi>Be
sober, be vigilant, because your Adversary the
Devil, as a roaring Lion, walketh about,
seeking whom he may devour. Whom resist
stedfast in the Faith.</hi> We overcome the
World, when the terrors and allurements
of it have less force and influence upon
us; 1 John 5. 4, 5. <hi>Whatsoever is born of
God, overcometh the World: And this is
the Victory that overcometh the World, even
our Faith. Who is he that overcometh the
World, but he that believeth that Iesus is the
Son of God?</hi> and, <hi>Gal. 6. 14. But God
forbid that I should glory, save in the Cross
of our Lord Iesus Christ, by whom the World
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:64994:150"/>
is crucified unto me, and I unto the World.</hi>
We overcome and subdue the Flesh, when
<hi>we have crucified the Flesh, with the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Lusts,</hi> Gal. 5. 24. When we
get the mastery over the passions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
thereof: and tho we be sometimes
foiled, yet the drift and bent of our lives
is for God, and our Salvation.</p>
                  <p>2. As to God, to whom we have devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
our selves. We must love him above
all, and not put him off with what the
Flesh can spare, or the World will allow,
or the Devil will suffer us to go on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly
with; but we must serve him sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely,
in Holiness and Righteousness all
our days, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 75. The love and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
service of our Creator, is our great
and daily work.</p>
                  <p>3. As to our End. We must live in
the hope of the coming of Christ, and
our everlasting Glory, <hi>Titus 2. 13. Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for that blessed hope, and the glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
of the great God, and our Saviour
Iesus Christ.</hi> And <hi>Iude,</hi> vers. 21. <hi>Keep
your selves in the love of God, looking for
the Mercy of our Lord Iesus Christ unto
eternal Life.</hi> Well then, as we did at first
thankfully accept of our recovery by
Christ, and did at first renounce the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:64994:150"/>
the World, and the Flesh, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to follow his direction, and use his
means in order to our final Happiness, so
we must still persevere in this mind and
resolution, till our Glory come in hand.
This is God's Wisdom.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us now see how this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of God is entertained by the carnal
World; 'tis there despised, slighted, and
contradicted. The World is a distracted
World; some neglect God's Counsel, and
never lay it to heart; <hi>Heb. 2. 3. How shall
we escape if we neglect so great Salvation?</hi>
and <hi>Mat. 22. 5. But they made light of it,
and went their ways, one to his Farm, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to his Merchandize.</hi> Some laugh at
these things, and make an holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<hi>life</hi> the matter of their scorn and
derision. Luke 16. 14. <hi>The Pharisees al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
who were covetous, heard all these things,
and they derided him.</hi> And, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 32.
—<hi>Some mocked; and others said, We will
hear thee again of this matter—Howbeit,
certain Men clave unto him, and believed.</hi>
There are others who fasten odious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
on the godly. And tho the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion be so holy and innocent in
its design, so agreeable to the nature of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:64994:151"/>
God and Man, so well contrived to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
our Miseries, and to secure our true
and proper Happiness; yet the strictness
of it is distasted by the World: By the
prophane, who have nothing to excuse
their wickedness, 'tis counted hypocrisy;
<hi>As deceivers, yet true,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 8. because
they cannot condemn the Life, they judg
the Heart: By them who affect the Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the World, and have a passionate
love for the Pleasures and Honours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
because the generality of the World
are of that mind, they brand it with the
imputation of foolish singularity. And
the Carnal Politicians, because it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet so well with the World, but some
things which God requireth are discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced,
they tax it of disobedience,
and they counted <hi>Paul</hi> as a mover of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<hi>Acts</hi> 25. 5. And because the
Operations of Grace are above the Line
of Nature, others tax it of Fanaticism
and Enthusiasm: Atheists who are all
for demonstrations of sense, sight, and
present things, because Christianity main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inviteth to things Spiritual and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
and to live upon the hopes of an
unseen World that is yet to come, they
judg it to be a foppery, or meer imposture,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:64994:151"/>
or needless superstition. Though both
the Hopes and Precepts of Religion carry
a marvellous complyance with right-rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
yet none of these things move them.
Lastly, There are others that malign, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and oppugn Holiness. There is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
enmity between the two Seeds; as
between the Wolf and the Lamb, the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and the Dove; the World will love
its own, and hate those that go a contrary
course, <hi>Iohn 15. 19. And as he that was
born after the Flesh, persecuted him that was
born after the Spirit, even so it is now,</hi> Gal. 4. 29.
and so it will be to the end of the World.
When the Powers of the World give any
rest, yet the carnal Seed will be mocking
and scoffing, and bringing God's holy Ways
into contempt, branding them with Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and Calumnies. The Reasons of
this, are partly because Men are drunk
with the delusions of the Flesh, and so
cannot judg of Spiritual Things; partly
to excuse themselves. Men will be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reling
at Religion, when they have no
mind to practise it; and dispute away Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
when they are unwilling to perform
them: Partly, they take occasion from
the failings of God's People, tho there is
no reason why they should do so. An Art
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:64994:152"/>
should not be condemned for the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
want of skill; but they do so. If
Christians be serious to any degree of sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
then Religion is counted an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>g, it mopeth them. If there
be any differences among God's People,
because of their several degrees of light,
oh then there are so many Sects, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and Controversies about Religion,
they suspect all, and are true to none. If
any creep into the Holy Profession, and
pallute it with their Scandals, then all
strictness in Religion is but a pretence and
imposture. If Men be strict, and would
avoid every ordinary failing incident to
Mankind, then they are more nice than
wise, and this is preciseness and indiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
'Twere endless to rake in this Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
and to reckon up all the Cavils and
Exceptions which naughty Men commense
against the Ways of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How, and Why it must be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by the sincere Professors of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
                  <p>1. How.</p>
                  <p>I answer; three ways.</p>
                  <p>(1.) It must be approved and received
by themselves. 'Tis Wisdom's Children
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:64994:152"/>
that can only justify Wisdom; they that
have entertained it, felt the power and
force of it in their own hearts: yea, their
very receiving is a justifying; they shew
the clamourings of the World do not
move them: Therefore it must be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by us, before it can be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to others; and approved, not
speculatively only, but practically, so as
to resolve to follow after Salvation in this
way. Speculatively, they may approve it
that have but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Rom. 2.
18, and 20 verses; a form of Knowledg,
and dishonour it in their practices, as <hi>vers.</hi>
23, 24. Men may justify Religion in
word, by a bare naked approbation, and
soundly vindicate it from the Cavils and
Exceptions of Men. But godly Men have
eyes to see the beauty and excellency of
it, and have sincerely accepted it; <hi>Acts
2. 41. They received the Word gladly.</hi> 'T is
good news to a poor guilty Conscience,
to hear of a pardoning God, and a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
and faithful Redeemer; the promise
of eternal Life, and a sure way had to
come to it. They are said to justify God,
that accepted his Counsel, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 29, 30.
The Hearts of God's Children are tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
possessed with the reality, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:64994:153"/>
and blessedness of this Religion;
they know and believe the infinite conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of these things: Their Faith is a
kind of justifying, <hi>Iohn 3. 33. He that
hath received his Testimony, hath set to his
Seal that God is true.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. It must be professed and owned,
when it is vilified, and in contempt and
disgrace in the World. We must stand
to Christ and his ways, tho we stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
as <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 Kings 19. 10. and not
be ashamed of Holiness, notwithstanding
trouble and contradiction. Christ will be
confessed before Men, and will be ashamed
before God and Angels, of them who are
ashamed of him in the World, and refuse
to own Him, and his Ways, and Truths,
only because they are despised, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted,
and discountenanced in the
World. Pleading for Religion is one of
the professing Acts, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 13. We
having the same Spirit of Faith, according
as it is written, I believed, and therefore have
I spoken: We also believe, and therefore
speak.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> when sore afflicted, did
confess and avow his confidence in God;
so we heartily believing and approving
the Gospel, must make a bold profession
of it. The Sacraments were ordained for
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:64994:153"/>
this purpose, for badges of Profession.
Baptism is a visible entring into Covenant
with God; Mark 16. 16. <hi>He that believeth,
and is baptized, shall be saved; and he that
believeth not, shall be damned.</hi> Where not
only Belief is required, but open Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Baptism is a Badg and a Bond; a
Badg to distinguish the worshippers of
Christ from others, and a Bond to bind us
to open profession of the Name of Christ.
The Lord's Supper, it is a profession of
Communion; 1 Cor. 10. 16. <hi>The Cup of
Blessing which we bless, is it not the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Blood of Christ? The Bread
which we break, is it not the communion of
the Body of Christ?</hi> and, <hi>vers. 18. Are
not they which eat of the Sacrifices, partakers
of the Altar?</hi> They that did any part of
the Sacrifices, did eat and drink with God
at the Altar. And, <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21.—<hi>I would
not that ye should have fellowship with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.
Ye cannot drink the Cup of the Lord,
and the Cup of Devils: ye cannot be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of the Lord's Table, and the Table of
Devils.</hi> Professing communicating with
Christ, is not consistent with professing
communicating with Devils. So Prayer
and Praise is a part of Confessing; <hi>Rom.
10. 10. With the Heart Man beliveth unto
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:64994:154"/>
Righteousness, and with the Mouth Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is made unto Salvation.</hi> The first is
proved <hi>vers. 11. For the Scripture saith,
Whosoever believeth on him, shall not be
ashamed.</hi> The second, <hi>vers. 13. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall call upon the Name of the Lord,
shall be saved.</hi> Calling upon the Name
of the Lord in Prayer and Praise; 'Tis
an open professing Act, by which we own
God in Christ for our God. So the assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
our selves together for publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
is a part of this Profession, and
must not be omitted for fear. Heb. 10. 23,
with 25. <hi>Let us hold fast the profession of
our Faith without wavering.</hi> How? <hi>vers.</hi>
25. <hi>Not forsaking the assembling of our selves
together, as the manner of some is.</hi> These
Assemblies were instituted for publick
converse with God, testifying their Union
and Agreement in the same Faith and
Worship: Indeed, in lesser Truths, that
fall within the latitude of allowable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
in the Church, Profession is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a Duty, for in some cases we may
have Faith to our selves: But a denying of
God, or being ashamed of him, is always
a sin. When called to give an account,
we are with boldness to own our Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Acts 4. 10. <hi>Be it known unto you all,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:64994:154"/>
and to all the People of Israel, that by the
Name of Iesus Christ of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>whom
ye crucified, whom God raised from the
dead, even by him doth this Man stand
here before you whole.</hi> And, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 17, 18.
<hi>If it be so, our God whom we serve, is able
to deliver us from the burning fiery Furnace,
and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O
King. But if not, be it known unto thee, O
King, that we will not serve thy Gods, nor
worship the golden Image, which thou hast
set up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. This Profession must be honoured,
and recommended to others, by an holy
Conversation. But now what kind of
conversation honoureth Religion.</p>
                  <p>1. Such as is carried on with diligence
and seriousness: As <hi>Noah,</hi> Heb. 11. 7. <hi>By
Faith</hi> Noah <hi>being warned of God of things
not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared
an Ark to the saving of his House; by the
which he condemned the World, and became
Heir of the Righteousness which is by Faith.</hi>
They behaved themselves, as those that in
earnest believed a Flood, when they made
such thorow preparation, which was a just
reproof to the security and incredulity of
the carnal World. Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n we do, as we
say in good earnest, make preparation for
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:64994:155"/>
another World, otherwise Religion is but
suspected as a vain pretense, and empty
talk. Then we look after Heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
then we believe it, when we do
the things that belief bindeth us unto.
A carnal Man that is all talk and no pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
he doth not Religion so much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in his words, as he doth dishonour it
in his works. He liveth down his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
while he seemeth to cry it up, <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
1. 16. They profess that they know God,
but in works they deny him, being abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and disobedient, and unto every good
work reprobate.</hi> Contrary motions are an
implicite denial of the Faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8.
But laziness and negligence do also foment
and breed Atheism; and we carry on the
life of Godliness coldly and faintly, and
so our Conversations, which should be a
confirmation of the Gospel, prove a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
rather. Those that are Disciples
in Name only, the Word of God cometh
to them in Word only. The careless Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticer
is as bad as he that is haunted with
actual doubts about the Truth of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.
The troubled Doubter mindeth
his business, but these never regard it, and
do in effect say, That Christ and his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is not worth the looking after. As
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:64994:155"/>
'tis said of the Israelites, <hi>Psal. 106. 24.
They despised the good Land, they believed
not his Word.</hi> Those that resolved to give
over the pursuit of <hi>Canaan,</hi> are said to
doubt of his Promise. So they that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
Salvation, do not believe the truth
of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3, 4. and tho they talk high,
they secretly propagate their infidelity.
The strength of our Faith should appear
by the diligence of our Lives, the seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of our Endeavours, and the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
of our Duties. Practices do more
express the Image of our Minds than
Words. The Faith that issueth out into
Works, doth most commend it self to
others; 2 Thess. 1. 11, 12. <hi>That you may
fulfil the Work of Faith with Power; that
Christ Iesus may be glorified in you, and you
in him.</hi> Then is Christ glorified, when
you live answerably to your Profession,
and do by the Power of God carry on
an Holy Life upon the incouragements of
the Promises of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>2. Such as is governed by the respects
of the other World. When we are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
and joyful under the Cross, and full
of hope and comfort in great straits, and
delight in our Work, which the World
hateth and discountenanceth, and hope
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:64994:156"/>
against Hope, and live in the Promises;
Psal. 119. 111. <hi>Thy Testimonies have I taken
as an Heritage for ever: for they are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing
of my heart.</hi> Then we justify Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and commend our Faith to others.
God was angry with <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi>
Numb. 20. 12. <hi>Because ye believed not, to
sanctify me in the Eyes of the Children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
We are not only firmly to believe
our selves, but to sanctify him in the eyes
of others; and that is done by the labour
of our Faith, the patience of our Hope,
our joyfulness and delight in God, when
we have but little in hand, and the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our Obedience, even under deep
Sufferings. When the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> had
received the Word in much Assurance and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and much joy in the Holy
Ghost; The Apostle telleth, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.
5, 6, 7. <hi>They were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>samples to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in</hi> Achaia <hi>and</hi> Mac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>donia, <hi>and from
them sounded out the Word of God to other
places.</hi> Thus we propagate our Faith, and
commend the Truth of God to others.
The Life of Faith is a glorious Thing, but
the Life of Sense or Reason hath no glory
in it, or a Life carried on meerly upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Probabilities. When we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
this World, both the good and evil
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:64994:156"/>
things of it, in hopes of a better, and part
with all that is dear to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s in this World,
upon the Conscience of our Duty, then
we justify Wisdom.</p>
                  <p>3. By an exact purity and holiness, or
a full conformity to all God's Precepts
and Institutes, and by a faithful discharging
all Duties to God and Men. Every true
Christian should be a transcript of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
2 Cor. 3. 3. <hi>Ye are manifestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to be the Epistle of Christ, written not
with Ink, but with the Spirit.</hi> An Epistle
is that wherein a Man hath written his
Mind; our Conversations should be Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
exemplified, a real Sermon, <hi>Phil. 2.
16. Holding forth the Word of Life.</hi> The
Wax hath an impression and stamp left
upon it, according to what is engraven
upon the Seal. Then we honour Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when the impression and print of it
is left upon our Hearts and Lives, and we
are cast into this Mould. More particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
Duties of Relations, which are visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and easily observed, justify and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
Religion; Titus 2. 10. <hi>and</hi> 1 Pet.
2. 15. <hi>So is the Will of God, that with well-doing
ye may put to silence the ignorance of
foolish Men.</hi> These conduce to the good
of humane Societies, are most regarded,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:64994:157"/>
and make the ways of God amiable. Thus
how Wisdom is to be justified.</p>
                  <p>I now come to shew you,</p>
                  <p>2. Why.</p>
                  <p>1. Because of the charge that is put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us to testify for God, and justify his
Ways; Isa. 43. 10. <hi>Ye are my Witnesses,
saith the Lord.</hi> They that are most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with God, can most witness for
him. So Wisdom's Children can most ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify
Her. They are acquainted with her
Promises and Precepts, and have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the virtue and power of them, in
comforting and changing the Heart. A
report of a report, is a cold thing; they
that have felt somewhat in their Hearts,
that which they have seen and felt, they
can speak of. The World needeth some
Witnesses for God, some Testimony and
preparative inducement to invite them to
embrace the ways of God. Miracles ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for that use heretofore; Acts 5. 32.
<hi>And we are his witnesses of those things, and so
is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given
to them that obey him.</hi> And in the place
of Miracles, there succeeded good conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
or the wonderful effects of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
Grace in the Heart and Lives of his
Children; this is apt to beget wonder, as
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:64994:157"/>
Miracles did, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 4. When they can
renounce the Lusts which most are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stered
by, and grow dead to worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
live in the World above the
World, in the Flesh contrary to the Flesh.
A Miracle strikes a little wonderment at
first, but this sinketh and soaketh to the
Heart. When Men are so strictly Holy,
so ravishingly Heavenly, and bear up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the hopes and incouragements of the
other World, and are so conscientious in
all Duties to God and Man, you shew that
Religion is not a Notion, or an Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>2. Wisdom deserveth to be justified by
us. What is there in all the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but what is justifiable, or that we
should be ashamed of? Is it the hopes of
it? The hopes of it are such as are fit to
be propounded to Man, sought after by
all the World, but no where discovered
with such certainty and distinctness as in
the Gospel. Nothing doth resine and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ble
the Heart so much as these hopes; the
heavenly Spirit, that can support it self
with the hopes of an unseen Glory, is the
only true sublime Spirit: an earthly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
is a base Spirit, so a sensual, the dregs
of Mankind. Amongst Men, the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:64994:158"/>
who aspire to Crowns and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and aim at perpetual Fame by their
Heroick Virtues and Exploits, are judged
Persons of far greater Gallantry, than co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
Muckworms or brutish Epicures;
yet they are poor base spirited People in
their highest Thoughts and Designs, to
that noble and divine Spirit which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the breast of those who sincerely
and heartily seek Heavenly Things. For
what is the honour of the World to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
with God? temporal Trifles to
an everlasting Kingdom? Is it the way and
means, the first, the terms of setling our
Souls in the way of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?
What more Rational? Should we
return to our Creator's Service without
acknowledging our Offence in straying or
humbling our selves for our Errors, and
purposing for the future to live in his Love
and Obedience? Or can we expect Mercy
without returning? Reason will say, our
case is not compassionable: Or should
God quit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Law without satisfaction? Or
should we not own our Benefactor, the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> satisfying? certainly there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>
reasonable? So also for new
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Therefore Wisdom deserveth
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> by us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:64994:158"/>3. Those that condemn Wisdom, yet
do in some measure at the same time justify
it. They condemn it with their Tongues,
but justify it with their Consciences: They
hate and fear strictness; <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 20. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod
<hi>feared</hi> John, <hi>because he was a just Man,
and an holy, and observed him.</hi> They sco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>f
at it with their Tongues, but have a fear
of it in their Consciences: They revile
at it while they live, but what mind are
they of when they come to die? Then all
will speak well of an holy Life, and the
strictest obedience to the Laws of God;
Numb. 23. 10. <hi>Let me die the death of the
Righteous, and let my last end be like his.</hi>
And, <hi>Mat. 25. 8. Give us of your Oil, for
our Lamps are gone out.</hi> Oh that they had
a little of that holiness and strictness which
they sco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fed at, whilst they were pursuing
their Lusts! How will they desire to
die? As carnal and careless Sinners, or as
morti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ied Saints? They approve it in <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi>
and condemn it in <hi>Hypothesi.</hi> All the
opposers and scoffers at Godliness, within
the Pale of the visible Church, have the
same Bible, Baptism, Creed, and pretend
to believe in the same God and Christ,
which they own with those whom they
oppose: All the difference is, the one are
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:64994:159"/>
real Christians, the other are nominal;
some profess at large, others practise what
they profess; the one have a Religion to
talk of, the other to live by; they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it in the Form, but hate it in the
Power. A Picture of Christ that is
drawn by a Painter they like, and the
forbidden Image of God made by a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
they will reverence and honour,
and be zealous for; but the Image of God
framed by the Spirit in the Hearts of the
Faithful, and described in the lives of the
heavenly and the sanctified, this they
scorn and scoff at.</p>
                  <p>4. If we do not justify Religion, we
justify the World. It must needs be so,
for these two are opposites, the carnal
World, and Wisdom: the carnal World
must be condemned, and Religion justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
or Religion will be condemned, and
the World justified. Some condemn the
World, <hi>Heb. 11. 7. By Faith</hi> Noah <hi>being
warned of God of things not seen as yet,
moved with fear, prepared an Ark to the
saving of his House; by the which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
the World, and became Heir of the
Righteousness which is by Faith.</hi> Some ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
the World, as <hi>Israel</hi> justified <hi>Sodom,</hi>
Ezek. 16. 51. <hi>But thou hast multiplied thy
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:64994:159"/>
Abominations more than they, and hast ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
thy Sisters in all thine Abominations
which thou hast done.</hi> Their Sin seemeth
more excusable; you either upbraid their
security and carelesness, or countenance it
by your own practice; your seriousness
is a real rebuke to the carnal World: your
working out your Salvation in fear and
trembling, upbraideth their security and
carelesness; your rejoicing in God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth
their carnal delight. When you
are troubled about a vain Thought, and
are watchful against a light Word, you
condemn them for their loosness, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
in all silthiness: but if not, you
justify the World, and harden the Wicked
in their Prejudices, and cause them to hold
up their course with the greater pretence.
When you are wrathful, proud, sensual,
turbulent, self-seeking, you are an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of stumbling unto them. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in

in their way.</p>
                  <p>5. Christ will one day justify all his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Followers before Men, and Angels,
and Devils. Luke 12. 8. <hi>Whosoever shall
confess me, him shall the Son of Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
before the Angels of God.</hi> Let us ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify
his ways, and he will justify us, and
our Faith at length shall be found to
Praise, and Glory, and Honour. Christ
will then wipe off all the Aspertions which
be cast upon the Children of Wisdom for
Godliness-sake, as Faction, Pride, Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,
Hypocrisy; and that which was
branded with such ignominious Titles, will
then be found to be the very Wisdom of
God.</p>
                  <p>6. Because of the necessity of justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Wisdom, in the times we live in; 'tis
said, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 3. In the last Time there
shall come Scoffers, and Mockers, walking
after their own Lusts.</hi> The last days shall
be full of these prophane Scoffers. While
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:64994:161"/>
Truths were new, and the exercises of the
Christian Religion lovely, there was
great concord and seriousness amongst the
Professors of the Gospel, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Scoffers were rare and unfrequent.
Before Mens senses were benummed with
the customary use of Religious Duties,
the Notions of God were fresh and lively
upon their Hearts; but afterwards when
the Profession of Christianity grew into
a form and national Interest, and Men
were rather made Christians by the chance
of their Birth, than choice and rational
Convictions; then the Church was much
pestered with this kind of Cattel; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
now are they rise among us, who
live in the dregs of Christianity, when
Men are grown weary of the Name of
Christ, and the ancient severity and strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is much lost, and the memory of
those Miracles, and wonder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ul Effects by
which our Religion was confirmed, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
worn out, or else questioned by
Men of subtile Wits, and a prostituted
Conscience. Therefore now Mockers,
and Men of atheistical Spirits swarm every
where, and it concerneth Wisdom's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to justify it, and to maintain its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Vigor and Power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="313" facs="tcp:64994:161"/>The <hi>Vse</hi> that we may make is double;</p>
                  <p>1. To the Enemies of Wisdom. Judg
not of an Holy Life, and those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
it at a distance and by hear-say, but
try. We are not afraid to come to the Bar
with our Enemies; John 7. 24. <hi>Iudg not
according to appearance, but judg Righteous
Iudgment.</hi> If Men would not be blinded
with visible Appearance, and the Mask of
Passiou, Prejudice, and Interest, and
condemn the People of God as they are
represented in a false Mirror; judg and
spare not, and where you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ind the true
Spirit of Christianity, take all leave, we
desire no other Trial; but speak not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
things you know not. Try, and
judg as you find, where is the deepest
sense of the other World, where the most
careful preparation to get thither; the
joy of Faith, the love of Holiness. If
Christianity will allow that worldly Pomp,
that vanity and liberty which others take,
then judg the Servants of the Lord as
guilty of a foolish niceness, preciseness,
and singularity; but if we be baptized
into these things, and unquestionably and
indispensibly bound to them, either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
your Baptism, or forbear your
Censures, or rather chuse this clear and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:64994:162"/>
pure way to everlasting Glory. If you
will not stand to God's Word, stand to
your own sober Moods. We will make
you your selves Judges, when you are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and best able to judg of things, not
in you Passion, when Lusts are stirring.
When you are entring the Confines of
Eternity, when Conscience is likely to
speak truth to you, you will wish then
you were one of those poor godly Men,
whom now you count proud, humorous,
and factious.</p>
                  <p>2. To the Children of VVisdom. Do
not scandalize the Holy VVays of God,
but justify them; be neither ashamed of
them, nor a shame to them: Till the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
strictness be revived, VVisdom will
never be justified.</p>

                  <p>HERE are three Stories put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by the Evangelist, to
teach us in what manner we
should address our selves to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Christ.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>first</hi> is of a Scribe, that came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called,
but his Heart was not right with
God, having a temporal biass upon it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>second</hi> is of one called, <hi>vers.</hi> 59.
Christ saith, <hi>Follow me.</hi> But he would
first cherish, then bury his dying Father.
But Christ would have no delays, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
sets him about his Ministry and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in the Gospel. This upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it upon Ancient Tradition, is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to be <hi>Philip.</hi>

but first he would take his farewel at
home, and compose Matters in his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
But when we set our Faces Godward,
there is no looking back. There must be
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:64994:163"/>
no more consulting with Flesh and Blood;
The Divine Instinct must be obeyed spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
and wholly, and Christ followed
without Reserves and Conditions.</p>
                  <p>Of these in their order.</p>

                     <hi>I begin with the First.</hi> And it came to

said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee
whithersoever thou goest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which words observe;</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>The Time.</hi> It came to pass, as they
went on the way, a certain Man said to
him.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>A Resolution professed.</hi> Lord, I will
follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Christ's Reply.</hi> And Iesus said
unto him, Foxes have Holes, and the Birds
of the Air have Nests; but the Son of Man
hath not where to lay his head.</p>
                  <p>1. The Time. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 19. 'Tis
when Christ had a mind to retire, and
had declared his purpose to go into the
Desert. In <hi>Luke,</hi> when he stedfastly set
his Face to go to <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> Both may
agree; the one more immediatly, the
other more remotely; first to the Desert,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:64994:164"/>
then to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> About that time, a
certain Man seeing Christ about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
from the place where he then was,
offereth himself to be one of his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
This certain Man is by St. <hi>Matthew</hi>
said to be a Scribe. Men of that Rank
and Order, had usually a Male Talent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Gospel, and are frequently
coupled with the Pharisees, Men cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
and of a bitter Spirit. This Man
seeing Christ did great Miracles, and
hoping that he would set up a Temporal
Kingdom, he puts in for a place betimes,
that he might share in the Honours of
it.</p>
                  <p>2. Here is a Resolution professed; <hi>Lord,
I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</hi>
Where take notice,</p>
                  <p>(1.) Of the ready forwardness of the
Scribe: He was not called by Christ, but
offered himself of his own accord.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Observe the largeness of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
and unboundedness of it, <hi>Whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever;</hi>
as indeed it is our Duty to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Christ through thick and thin. In
the <hi>Revelations,</hi> Christ's unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iled Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
are described to be such as follow
the Lamb whithersoever he goeth, <hi>Rev.</hi>
14. 4. That is, obeyed him, though to
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:64994:164"/>
their great peril and loss. Well then,
here is readiness, here is largeness; it is
well if all be sincere. Therefore let us
see,</p>
                  <p>3. Christ's Answer and Reply: <hi>And
Iesus said unto him, Foxes have Holes, and
the Birds of the Air have Nests, but the
Son of Man hath not where to lay his Head.</hi>
By the tenour of Christ's Answer, you
may know what ails him, and on what
Foot he limped; For this is spoken ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by way of preparation, to enable
him to keep his Resolution, or rather by
way of probation, to try the truth and
strength of it, whether it were sincere
and sound, yea or no: As the young
Man was tried; Mark 10. 21. <hi>One thing
thou lackest, go thy way, sell whatsoever thou
hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt
have Treasure in Heaven; and come, and
take up thy Cross and follow me:</hi> But he
went away sad at that saying. So here,
we hear no more of this Scribe; our
Lord knew how to discover Hypocrites.
Two things were defective in this Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
                  <p>1. 'Twas suddain and rash, not weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Difficulties. They that rashly
leap into a Profession, usually fall back at
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:64994:165"/>
first trial. Therefore we must sit down
and count the Charges, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 28.</p>
                  <p>2. There was a carnal Aim in it. He
minded his own Profit and Honour:
Therefore Christ in effect telleth him, you
had best consider what you do, for fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
of me, will be far from advancing
any temporal Interest of yours. The
Scribe was leavened with a Conceit of a
worldly Kingdom, and had an Eye to
some Temporal Advantage: Therefore
Christ telleth him plainly, There was no
worldly Ease and Riches to be expected
from him: And so, <hi>Non repulit valentem;
sed fingentem prodidit;</hi> 
                     <q>He did not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
a willing Follower, but discover
a worldly Hypocrite,</q> saith <hi>Chrysologus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctrine we learn from hence is
this;</p>
                  <p>They that will sincerely follow Christ, must
not look for any great Matters in the
World, but rather prepare themselves
to run all hazards with him.</p>
                  <p>This is evident;</p>
                  <p>1. From Christ's own Example. And
the same Mind should be in all his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers;
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:64994:165"/>
John 17. 16. <hi>They are not of the
World, even as I am not of the World.</hi> Our
estranging of our Hearts from the World,
is an evidence of our conformity to Christ.
Christ passed through the World to sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
it as a Place of Service; but his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Residence was not here, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ix it as a
Place of Rest: And all that are Christ's,
are alike affected. We pass through as
Strangers, but are not at home as Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
or Dwellers; and if we have little
of the World's Favour, 'tis enough if any
degree of Service for God.</p>
                  <p>2. From the Nature of his Kingdom.
His Kingdom is not of this World, <hi>Iohn</hi>
18. 3, 6. 'Tis not a Kingdom of Pomp,
but a Kingdom of Patience. Here we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
with Christ, hereafter we reign with
him. The Comforts are not earthly, or
the good Things of this World; but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
the good Things of the World to
come. This was the Scribes Mistake.</p>
                  <p>3. From the Spirit of Christ. His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is given us, to draw us off from this
World to that which is to come. 1 <hi>Cor. 2.
12. Now we have not received the Spirit of
the World, but the Spirit which is of God,
that we may know the Things which are given
us of God.</hi> The Spirit of the World, is
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:64994:166"/>
that which possesseth and governeth world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Men, and inclineth them to a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Happiness; this is in all Men naturally:
Corrupt Nature doth sufficiently prompt
and incline Men to look after the Honours,
and Pleasures, and Profits of this World.
<hi>Iames</hi> 3. 15. the Apostle, when he would
describe the Wisdom which is not from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
he saith, that it is <hi>earthly, sensual,
devillish;</hi> this Wisdom cometh not from
above. Present Things are known by
Sense, and known easily, and known by
all. But there is a Divine Spirit put into
Christians, which inclineth them to Things
to come, and worketh Graces suitable:
Some of which give us a sight of the
Truth of those Things, as Faith; some, a
Taste or an Esteem of them, as Love;
some an earnest Desire, as Hope: This
Spirit cometh from God and Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi>
1. 17, 18. And without these Graces we
can have no sight nor desire of heavenly
Things. 1 Cor. 2. 14. <hi>The natural Man
receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God,
for they are Foolishness unto him; neither can
he know them, because they are spiritually dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</hi>
They think 'tis folly to hazard
present Conveniencies for future Rewards;
and the truest Wisdom to live in Ease,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:64994:166"/>
Plenty, and Honour. On the contrary,
the Divine Spirit convinceth us, that there
is no such Business of Importance, as look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after eternal Life: That all the gay
Things of Sense are but so many Maygames
to Heavens Happiness; the terrible Things
of the World, are but as a Flea-biting to
Hell-Torments; and the Pudder and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
of the World, but as a little childish
Sport, in comparison of working out our
Salvation with fear and trembling. This
Spirit helpeth us to overcome the World,
and grow dead to the World, that we
may be alive to God; to look for no
great things here, but in the World to
come. This Spirit is that which we should
all labour after.</p>
                  <p>4. From the Covenant of Christ. 'Tis
one thing implied in the Gospel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
when our Lord Jesus sets down the
Terms, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24. he saith, <hi>If any Man
will come after me, let him deny himself, and
take up his Cross, and follow me:</hi> That is,
we must so believe in Christ, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
of the Truth of his heavenly Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
that we are willing to deny our
Wit and Will, natural Interests and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and to lose all, rather than lose
our Souls, or miss of the Happiness he
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:64994:167"/>
offereth us. Nay, taking up the Cross is
so considerable a part of our Resignation
to Christ, and Trust in him, that in <hi>Luke</hi>
'tis said, <hi>chap. 9. 23. Let him take up his
Cross daily:</hi> How daily? There are fair
Days as well as foul, and the face of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
doth not always look sad and lowring.
What is the meaning then of that, <hi>Let him
take up his Cross daily?</hi> I answer; First,
it must be meant of daily Expectation.
The first day that we begin to think of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
serious Christians, we must reckon of
the Cross, we know not how soon it may
come. If God seeth fit to spare you, yet
you must be prepared for it; Stand ready,
as Porters in the Streets, to take up the
Burden which you must carry. Daily
inure your thoughts to the Cross, that the
grievousness and bitterness of it may be
somewhat allay'd. St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Acts
21. 13. I am ready not to be bound only, but
also to die at</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>for the Name of the
Lord Iesus.</hi> And, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 15. one great
Piece of the spiritual Armor is, the <hi>Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Gospel of Peace.</hi> And, 1 <hi>Pet.
3. 15. Be ready always to give an Answer
to every Man that asketh a Reason of the
Hope that is in you, with meekness and fear.</hi>
Be ready in point of Courage. Now this
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:64994:167"/>
is necessary, because we are so apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
great things to our selves, and indulge
the Security of the Flesh, by putting off
the Thoughts of the Cross. But Evils fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarized
are the less burdensom, and by
renewing our Resolution daily, we are the
more fortified. Secondly, to shew the
Continuance of our Conflicts, as if every
day there were some new Exercise for our
Faith and Patience. We are not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
to God, how long he shall afflict us,
nor with how much Affliction he shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
us; No, tho it were all the days of
our Lives, we must be content: 'Tis but
a Moment to Eternity. We must take up
our Cross, till God remove it. Some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
fair, to be contented with a naked
Christ, tho they run all Hazards, because
they hope God will not take them at their
Words; but as soon as the Cross cometh,
wriggle, shift, and distinguish themselves
out of their Duty; or else if it be long,
and frequently return, quite tire and
are faint. So that <hi>Take it up daily,</hi> is as
much as, <hi>Let Patience have its perfect Work.
Iames</hi> 1. 4. If day after day we must be
troubled, we must be content to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.
If God send it daily, we must take
it up daily. Well then, in the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:64994:168"/>
we undertook this: the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
doth comprize this as a clear branch
and part of it. Christ telleth us the
worst at first; the Devil sheweth us the
Bait, but hideth the Hook. The World
useth to invite its Followers with promises
of Honour and Riches; but Christ telleth
us of the Cross, and that partly to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage

all trouble and molestation. This is all
one as if a Souldier going to the Wars,
should promise himself a continual Peace
or Truce with the Enemy: Or as if a
Mariner, undertaking a long Voyage,
should only think of fair Weather, and a
calm Sea, without Waves and Storms; so
irrational is it for a Christian to look for
nothing but Rest and Peace here upon
Earth. No, a Christia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> had need think
of this to a double end, that he may be a
mortified and a resolute Man: If he be
not mortified and dead to the World, he
can never undergo the variety of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which his Religion will expose him
unto; and say with the Apostle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.
12, 13. <hi>I can do all things through Christ
which strengthneth me. Notwithstanding,
ye have well done, that ye did communicate
with my affliction.</hi> And there is usually in
us a propensity and inclination, either
to Honours, Riches, or Pleasures. And
the Devil will work upon that weakness;
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 13. That which is lame, is soon
turned out of the way. If we have any
weak part in our Souls, there the Assault
will be most strong and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ierce. A Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that looketh to be besieged, will take
care to fortify the weak places, where there
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:64994:169"/>
is any suspicion of an Attaque: So should
a Christian mortify every corrupt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
lest it betray him, be it love of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Pleasure, or Profit. He had need
be also a well-resolved Man, well shod
with the preparation of the Gospel of
Peace, or else in hard way he will soon
founder and halt. If you be Christians
indeed, you will soon see the necessity of
it. Pure Nature it self is against bearing
the Cross: Christ shewed the innocent
Aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ctions of humane Nature in his own
Person: it recoiled a little at the thought
of the dreadful Cup; Heb. 5. 7. <hi>Who in
the days of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

Prayers and Supplication, with strong crying
and tears, unto him that was able to save him
from death, and was heard in that he feared.</hi>
And to us 'tis much more grievous to
suffer. <hi>Heb. 12. 11. Now no chastning for
the prese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>

                        </gap>emeth to be joyous, but grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous:
nevertheless, afterward it yieldeth the
peaceable Fruit of Righteousness, unto them
which are ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rcised thereby.</hi> But corrupt
Nature will certainly draw back, unless
we be armed with great resolution; for
after we have launched out into the deep
with Christ, we shall be ready to run <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
again upon every Storm, unless we
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:64994:169"/>
be resolved: therefore you need to think
of the Cross to breed this resolution. If
Christians be not mortified, they trip up
their own Heels: if they be not resolved
and prepared for all Weathers, they take
up Religion, rather as a Walk for Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than as a Journey or serious Passage
to Heaven. Therefore we must all of us
prepare for Sufferings in this World, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for no great matters here. We must
expect Persecutions, Crosses, Losses,
Wants, Defamation, Injuries: and we
must get that Furniture of heart and mind,
which may support and comfort us in
such a day of tryal.</p>
                  <p>2. It informeth us what Fools they are,
that take up Religion upon a carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of Ease and Plenty, and will follow
Christ to grow rich in the World: As
this Scribe thought to make a Market of
the Gospel, as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.
19, 20. He thought to make a gain by the
Power of Miracles. There are Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
which Religion affordeth in peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Times; but the very Profession, at
other Times, will ingage us in great
Troubles: And therefore Men do but
make way for the shame of a Change, and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:64994:170"/>
other Mischiefs, that hope for Temporal
Commodities by the Profession of the
Gospel. There are few that are willing
to follow a naked Christ, upon unseen
incouragements; but this must be, for
they that aim to seek the World in and
by their Religion, are disclaimed by our
Lord as unfit to be his Servants: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
sorry Servants they are, who cannot
live without Honour, Ease, and Plenty;
therefore turn and wind to shift the Cross,
put many a fallacy upon their own Souls.
Gal. 6. 12. <hi>As many as desire to make a
fair shew in the Flesh, compel you to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
only, lest they should suffer perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
for the Cross of Christ.</hi> If that be
their only Motive, they are apt to desert
or pervert Christ's Cause. Again, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
telleth us of some, <hi>who are Enemies
to the Cross of Christ, whose God is their
Belly, who mind earthly Things,</hi> Phil. 3.
18, 19. Men that have no love to God,
but only serve their fleshly Appetites, and
look no higher than Honours, Riches,
Pleasures, and applause with Men, will
never be faithful to Christ: They are such
as study to save themselves, not from Sin,
but from Danger, and accordingly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
themselves to every Interest: As
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:64994:170"/>
the Men of <hi>Keilah</hi> dealt with <hi>David,</hi>
entertained him for a while; But when
<hi>Saul</hi> pursued him, were resolved to betray
him: They would come into no danger
for <hi>David</hi>'s sake. So they deal with
Christ, and Religion. They profess
Christ's Name, but will suffer nothing for
him: If they may injoy Him, and his
Ways with peace and quietness, and
conveniency, and commodity to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
well and good; But if Troubles
arise for the Gospel's sake, immediatly
they fall off; not only these Summer-Friends
of the Gospel, but the most, yea
the best, have a secret lothness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingness
to condescend to a condition
of Trouble or Distress. This is a Point
of hard digestion, and most Stomachs
will not bear it.</p>
                  <p>3. It informs us what an unlikely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
they have in hand, who would bring
the World and Christ fairly to agree, or
reconcile their worldly Advantages, and
the Profession of the Gospel: And when
they cannot frame the World, and their
Conveniences to the Gospel, do fashion
the Gospel to the World, and the carnal
courses of it. 'Tis pity these Men had not
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:64994:171"/>
been of the Lord's Council, when he first
contrived and preached the Gospel, that
they might have helped him to some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
and middle courses, that might have
served turn for Heaven and Earth too.
But do they what they will, or can, the
Way is narrow that leadeth to Life; and
they must take Christ's Yoke upon them,
if they would find rest for their Souls.
They will find that pure and strict Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will be unpleasing to the Ungodly and
the Carnal; that the Enmity between the
two Seeds will remain, and the Flesh and
the World must not always be pleased:
that there is more danger of the World
smiling, than frowning. As to the Church
in general, (in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Time) <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia
facta est opibus major, virtutibus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor:</hi>
so to Believers in particular, that
the Heart is corrupted by the Love of the
World; and Men never grow so dull and
careless of their Souls, as when they
have most of the World at will. And
that we are more awakened, and have a
more lively sense of Eternal Life, when
under the Cross, than when we live in
the greatest ease and pomp. That Christ
permitteth Troubles, not for want of love
to his People, or want of Power to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:64994:171"/>
their peace, but for holy and wise
ends to promote their good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Is Instruction. When you come
to enter into Covenant with Christ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
                  <p>1. Christ knoweth what Motives do
induce you; John 2. 25. <hi>He needeth not
that any should testifie of Man, for he
knoweth what is in Man.</hi> Some believed,
but Jesus committed not himself unto
them: He knoweth whether there be a
real bent, or carnal biass upon the
Heart.</p>
                  <p>2. If the Heart be false in making the
Covenant, it will never hold good: An
error in the first Concoction, will never
be mended in the second; Deut. 5. 29.
<hi>O that there were such an heart in them,
that they would fear me, and keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
always, that it might be well with
them, and with their Children for ever.</hi> So,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21. The stony Ground received
the Word with joy; <hi>Yet hath he not root
in himself, but dureth but for a while; for
when Tribulation or Persecution ariseth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the Word, by and by he is offended.</hi>
Some temporal thing sitteth too near, and
close to the Heart: you are never upright
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:64994:172"/>
with God, till a Relation to God, and a
Right to Heaven, do incomparably weigh
down all temporal Troubles; and you
can rejoice more in the Testimonies of
God, fatherly Love, and right to eternal
Life, than in outward things; <hi>Psalm.</hi> 4.
6, 7. <hi>There be many that say, Who will shew
us any good? Lord lift thou up the Light of
thy Countenance upon us. Thou hast put
gladness in my heart, more than in the time
that their Corn and their Wine increased.
David</hi> speaks in his own Name, and in
the Name of all those that were alike
minded with himself. And, <hi>Luke 10. 20.
Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the
Spirits are subject unto you, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
because your Names are written in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. That Christ cannot but take it ill,
that we are so delicate and tender of our
Interests, and so impatient under the
Cross; when he endured so willingly such
great things for our sakes: we cannot
lose for him, so much as he hath done
for us; and if he had been unwilling to
suffer for us, what had been our state and
condition to all Eternity? we should have
suffered eternal Misery. If you would
not have Christ of another mind, why
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:64994:172"/>
will you be of another mind? 1 <hi>Pet. 4.
1. Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered
for us in the Flesh, arm your selves likewise
with the same mind; for he that hath suffered
in the Flesh, hath ceased from Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. If you be not dead to the things of
the World, you are not acquainted with
the Virtue and Power of Christ's Cross,
and have not a true sense of Christianity,
cannot glory in it as the most excellent
Profession in the World; Gal. 6. 14. <hi>God
forbid that I should glory, save in the Cross
of our Lord Iesus Christ, by whom the
World is crucified unto me, and I unto the
World.</hi> You are in a dangerous tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Atheism.</p>
                  <p>5. We are gainers by Christ, if we part
with all the World for his sake, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.
29, 30. Therefore no loss should seem too
great in obeying his Will. Certainly a
Man cannot be a loser by God.</p>
                  <p>6. All worldly things were confiscated by
the fall, and we can have no spiritual right
to them, 'till we receive a new grant by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, who is the Heir of all things.

                     <hi>God hath made them to be received with

is by the meer favour of the Redeemer,
and should be parted with again when he
calleth for it.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the first Point.</p>
                  <p>A second Doctrine or Point here offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
is,</p>
                  <p>The great Poverty of our Lord Iesus
Christ.</p>
                  <p>Beasts and Fowls have places to shelter
themselves in, but Christ had no certain
place of residence, or dwelling wherein
to rest. He doth not say, Kings have
Palaces, but I have none; rich Men have
Houses and Lands, but I have none: But
he saith, <hi>Foxes have Holes, and the Birds
of the Air have Nests, but the Son of Man
hath not where to lay his head.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reasons of this, are these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="337" facs="tcp:64994:173"/>1. To increase the value and merit of
his Satisfaction. Our Sins did deserve this,
his whole Humiliation, and every degree
of it; and Christ was content to suffer
it for the ransom of our Souls. 'Tis clear
this, that all his condescention conduced
to make up the Remedy more full: and
'tis evident by the Apostle, that it giveth us
a right to a larger allowance of Grace;
2 Cor. 8. 9. <hi>For ye know the Grace of our
Lord Iesus Christ, that though he was rich,
yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye
through his poverty might become rich.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Christ came to offer the Kingdom of
Heaven, and the good things of the other
World, and to draw Mens minds and
hearts thither. And therefore that he
might appear a fit Teacher of the World,
by his own Example, he taught us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of outward things. If he had
preached up heavenly-mindedness, and
lived himself in pomp and fulness, the
People would not have regarded his
words. <q>
                        <hi>Alexander,</hi> when his Army grew
sluggish, because laden with the spoils of
their Enemies; to free them from this
encumbrance, commanded all his own
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:64994:174"/>
Carriages to be set on fire; that when
they saw the King himself devote his
rich Treasures to the flame, they might
not murmur if their Mite and Pittance
were consumed also.</q> So if Christ had
taught us contempt of the World, and
had not given us an instance of it in his
Person, his Doctrine had been less power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and effectual.</p>
                  <p>3. To season and sanctify a mean estate
and degree of Life, when we are called
to it by God's Providence. Christ's own
poverty teacheth us to bear a mean condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
well; Mat. 18. 25. <hi>It is enough for
a Disciple that he be as his Master, and a
Servant as his Lord. Vriah</hi> would not
give way to any softness, while <hi>Ioab</hi> his
General was in the Field; 2 Sam. 11. 11.
<hi>The Ark, and Israel, are in Tents, and my
Lord</hi> Joab, <hi>and the Servants of my Lord
are in the open fields; Shall I go into my
House, and eat, and drink? &amp;c.</hi> We
must be contented to fare as Christ did, we
cannot be poorer than Christ as poor as
we are; for the poorest have some place
of shelter, but he had none whereon to
lay his head.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="339" facs="tcp:64994:174"/>1. Let this then enforce the former Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and teach us contempt of the World,
and the Riches and Greatness thereof. 'Tis
some Argument that the vilest are capable
thereof, as well as the most generous and
best deserving, and oftner it hapneth to
be so. But this is the Argument of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
That the Lord Jesus, when he
came to instruct the World by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
he was not one of the Rich and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous,
but chose a mean estate, as most
conducible to his ends.</p>
                  <p>2. If you be rich, yet be poor in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
Mat. 5. 3. <hi>Blessed are the poor in Spirit,
for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Let
us possess all things as if we possessed
them not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31. And so, <hi>Iames</hi>
1. 9, 10. <hi>Let the Brother of low degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
in that he is exalted: but the rich, in
that he is made low, because as the flower of
the Grass he shall pass away.</hi> We should
be as having nothing, sitting loose from
earthly things, considering that shortly we
shall be as poor as the poorest, for we can
carry nothing away with us.</p>
                  <p>3. Let us prepare our selves to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Poverty; and if it be already come
upon us, and God hath reduced us to a
mean inferior Life; let us have our hearts
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:64994:175"/>
reconciled and suited to a low estate, so
it may be an help to Heaven, so we may
have the true Riches, and may learn to
live by Faith, though God feedeth us
from Hand to Mouth; so we may imitate
Christ, and follow him into Glory, it is
enough for us.</p>

<hi>And he said unto another, Follow me,</hi> &amp;c.
He was already a Disciple at large; for in
<hi>Matthew</hi> 'tis said, <hi>Chap. 8. 21. Another
of his Disciples said unto him, Suffer
me first to go any bury my Father.</hi> He
was now called to a nearer and constant
attendance on Christ. <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus,</hi>
from an ancient Tradition, telleth
us, this was <hi>Philip.</hi> But before he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with this Call, he desireth a little
delay and respit, 'till his aged Father were
dead and buried; whether his Father were
already dead, and he would do this last

his Father were yet living, but not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
long to continue, and he would attend
him till his Death and Funeral, and then
follow Christ as <hi>Theophilact</hi> thinketh, it is
not much material. Clear it is, he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
off the matter with an excuse; even
the Elect do not at first so readily obey
the Heavenly Calling; some of them may
put off Christ, but when he intendeth to
have them, he will not be put off so, the
importunity of his Grace overcoming
their unwillingness.</p>

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. For the Expression. It may be used
either Proverbially, or Allusively. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbially;
Let one dead Man bury ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:64994:176"/>
that is, let them lie unburied, rather
than my Service be neglected; or, there
will not want others that will remove the
dead out of their sight: and 'tis our Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to let go things unnecessary, and
mind the main. Or else it is used Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,
to the Law of the <hi>Nazarites,</hi> and
the Priests of the Old Testament. The
Law of the <hi>Nazarites</hi> is in <hi>Numb.</hi> 6. 6, 7,
8. <hi>All the days that he separateth himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord, he shall come at no dead Body.
He shall not make himself unclean, for his
Father, or his Mother, for his Brother, or
his Sister, when they die: because the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
of his God is upon his Head. All the
days of his separation he is holy unto the
Lord;</hi> that is, he must rather follow his
Vow, in honouring the Lord, than to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
natural Duty, in honouring his dead
Parents. Now those whom Christ called
especially to follow him, were consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to that service, as the <hi>Nazarite</hi> unto
the Lord, during the days of his separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And as they might not meddle even
with the interment of their Parents, so
this excuse was frivolous. Or else the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion
might be to the High Priests, of
whom we read, <hi>Deut. 33. 9. Who said to
his Father, and his Mother,. I have not seen
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:64994:177"/>
him; neither did he acknowledg his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
nor know his own Children.</hi> Some
think this hath reference to the Levites
Fact, who being commanded by <hi>Moses,</hi>
killed every Man his Brother, Neighbour,
Friend, and Son, that had sinned in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
or worshipping the Golden Calf,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 26,—29. Rather 'tis meant
of the Priests continual Duty, who by
the Law, if his Father, Mother, Brother,
or Child did die, he might not mourn
for them, but carry himself as if he did not
respect or know them; for God would
have them more regard their Function or
Duty in his Service, than any natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
whatsoever: The Law is, <hi>Levit.</hi>
21. 11, 12. <hi>He shall not go in to any dead
Body, nor de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ile himself for his Father, or
his Mother; neither shall he go out of the
Sanctuary, nor prophane the Sanctuary of his
God, for the Crown of the anointing Oil of
his God is upon him.</hi> Now Christ alludeth
to the Law, to shew the urgency of this
present service and imploiment to which
he was consecrated: and the burial of the
Dead might be left to Persons less sacred,
or more at leisure.</p>
                  <p>2. The Reasons of Christ's refulsal.
Christ would shew hereby, 1. That all
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:64994:177"/>
Humane Offices and Duties, must give
place to the Duty we owe to God. Duty
to Parents must be observed, but Duty to
God must be preferred before that, or any
thing whatsoever. A Truth justified by
Christ's own Example. He began betimes,
at twelve years old, when he was dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with the Doctors, and his Parents
sought for him; Luke 2. 49. <hi>He said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, How is it that you sought me?
Wist you not that I must be about my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
business?</hi> So, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 47, 48. When
his Mother and Kindred waited for him,
desiring to speak with him, <hi>He answered
and said unto him that told him, Who is my
Mother, and who are my Brethren?</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to God, and declaring his Father's
Will, was dearer to him than all Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Natural and secular respects swayed
not with him, in comparison of gaining
Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>elites to Heaven; his Mother's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with him, was nothing to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Service, and teaching the People a
more acceptable Work, than paying a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
to his natural Relations: So, <hi>Iohn
2. 4. Woman, what have I to do with thee?
mine hour is not yet come.</hi> His Office to
which he was sent by God, was a matter
in which she, though his earthly Parent,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:64994:178"/>
was not to interpose, God's Work must
be done in God's own Way, Time, and
Method: God hath greater authority
over you, than all the Men in the World.
2. He would teach us hereby that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
requires the whole Man, even some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the omission of necessary Works,
much more superfluous; <hi>Give thy self
wholly to these things,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 15.</p>
                  <p>The words are now explained; The
practical Notes are these two;
<list>
                        <item>First, That nothing in the World is a
matter of such great weight, as to be a
sufficient excuse for not following of
Christ.</item>
                        <item>Secondly, That those who are called to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Christ, should follow him speedily,
without interposing any delays.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the first Point;</hi> That nothing in the
World is a matter of such great weight, as to
be a sufficient excuse for not following of
Christ.</p>
                  <p>I will illustrate it by these Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="347" facs="tcp:64994:178"/>1. <hi>There are two sorts of Men; Some
understand not their Lord's Will, others have
no mind to do it,</hi> Luke 12. 47, 48. Some
understand not the Terms of the Gospel;
they think to have Christ, and the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the Flesh, and the World too.
But there are others who understand
Christ's Terms, but are loth to become
Christ's Disciples; they know their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
Will, but they do not prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to do it; that is, they do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
set upon the Work, but make so
many delays, that it plainly appeareth
that they are loth to yield to Christ's
Terms; that is, to turn their backs upon
the Vanities of the World, and renounce
their most pleasing Sins, and to take the
Word for their Rule, the Spirit for their
Guide, and eternal Life for their Felicity
and Happiness; to such we now speak.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>They that have no mind to follow
Christ, put off the Matter with dilatory
shifts and excuses.</hi> To refuse altogether is
more hainous, and therefore they shift it
off for a time; <hi>Non vacat</hi> is the pretence,
I am not at leisure; <hi>Non placet,</hi> I like it
not, is the real interpretation, dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and inclination of their Hearts; for
Excuses are always a sign of an unwilling
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:64994:179"/>
and backward Heart. When they should
serve God, there is still something in the
way, some danger, or some difficulty
which they are loth to encounter
with: As, <hi>Prov. 26. 13. The slothful
Man saith, There is a Lion in the way, there
is a Lion in the streets. Palestine</hi> was a
Land infested with Lions, because of the
many Desarts and Thickets that were in
it; but being well peopled, they did rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear. Now the Sluggard taketh this
pretence from thence; if his Business lay
in the Fields, there was a Lion in the way;
if his Business lay in the Towns and Cities,
there is a Lion in the streets: as sometimes,
though but rarely, they came into places
inhabited, and of great resort. Now if
he should go about his Business too early,
he might meet with a Lion in his range
and walk, before they were retired into
their Dens. Thus do Men alarm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with their own foolish fears, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
their idleness and negligence. So a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>Prov. 15. 19. The way of the sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
is as an hedg of thorns, but the way of
the Righteous is made plain.</hi> They imagine
difficulties, and intollerable hardships in a
course of Godliness; but 'tis their cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise,
and pusilanimous negligence, which
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:64994:179"/>
maketh the Ways of God seem hard:
they are all comfortable, plain, and easy,
to the pure and upright Heart, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Mind. Come we to the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<hi>Luke 14. 18, 19, 20. They all with
one consent began to make excuse: The first
said, I have bought me a piece of Ground,
and I must go to see it; I pray thee have
me excused. And another said, I have
bought five yoke of Oxen, and I go to
prove them: I pray thee have me excused.
And another said, I have married a Wife,
and cannot come.</hi> The meaning is, Many
were invited to everlasting Happiness, but
they preferred their designs of worldly
advantages. Mark, they do not absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deny, but make excuse. Excuses are
the fruit of the quarrel between Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Corruption. They are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of better things, but being preposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and biassed with worldly Inclinations,
they dare not fully yield, nor flatly deny;
therefore they chose a middle course, to
make excuses. Doing is safe, or prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our selves to do; but excusing is but
a patch upon a filthy sore, or a poor co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
of Fig-leagues, for a naughty Heart.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>The usual excuses which Sinners may,
and usually do allege, are these four.</hi> The
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:64994:180"/>
Difficulty of Religion. The danger that
attendeth it. Want of Time. And that they
have no power or strength to do good.</p>
                  <p>1. For the first; 'Tis troublesome and
tedious to Flesh and Blood to be held to
so much Duty, and to wean our Hearts
from things we so dearly love; and the
World thinketh that we are too nice and
precise to urge Men to such a strict and
holy and heavenly Life, and less ado will
serve the turn.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>deligent, that ye
may be found of him in peace without spot
and blameless.</hi> And therefore if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny the ease and sloth of the Flesh,
you are wholly unfit for the Work of
Godliness.</p>
                  <p>(2.) This Diligence is no more than
needeth, whatever the carnal World
thinketh, who leave the Boat to the
Stream, and hope to be accepted with
God, for a few cold and drowsy Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or some superficial Righteousness. A
Painter-stainer, will think a Painter-lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
too curious, because his own work is
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:64994:180"/>
but a little daubing. The broad way
pleaseth the World best, but the narrow
way leadeth to Life.</p>
                  <p>(3.) This Diligence may be well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded,
considering that eternal <hi>Life</hi> and
<hi>Death</hi> is in the case. <hi>Life:</hi> Will you stop a
Journey for your Lives, because 'tis a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
tedious? or there is Dirt in the way,
or the Wind bloweth on you, and the
like? Since 'tis for God and Heaven, we
should not grudg at a little labour; 1 <hi>Cor.
15. 58. Therefore be ye stedfast, unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
always abounding in the Work of the
Lord; forasmuch as ye know that your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> There is
also <hi>Death</hi> in the case. Now which is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
To take a little profitable pains in
Godliness, or to endure everlasting Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?
to save a little labour or diligence
in the holy Life, and run the hazard of
being miserable for ever? Which is worst,
the trouble of Physick, or the danger of
a mortal Disease?</p>
                  <p>2. Another Excuse is, the Danger which
attendeth it. It may expose you to great
Troubles to own God and Religion hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily:
And if there be Peace abroad, and
Magistrates countenan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

many times at home a Man's greatest Foes
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:64994:181"/>
may be those of his own Houshold, <hi>Mat.</hi>
10. 36. But for the pleasing or displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of your Relations, you must not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
your Duty to God; as <hi>Ierom</hi> to
<hi>Helidorus; Per calcatum perge Patrem;</hi>
If thy Father lie in the way, tread upon his
Bowels rather than not come unto Christ.
Our Lord hath expresly told us, <hi>Mat. 10.
37. He that loveth Father or Mother more
than me, is not worthy of me.</hi> Neither fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
nor disfavour of our Friends, is a
just lett or impediment to our Duty: The
Advantages we can, or are likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from Parents, are not worthy to be
compared with those we expect from
God; nor is their Authority over us so
great as God's is; Luke 14. 26. <hi>If any
Man come to me, and hate not his Father or
Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
and Sisters, yea and his own Life also,
he cannot be my Disciple.</hi> Though Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
doth not discharge us from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Parents, yet the higher Duty
must be preferred, namely obedience to
Christ, and loving less is hating.</p>
                  <p>3. Another excuse is, I have no time to
mind Soul-affairs. My distractions in the
World are so great, and my course of life
is such, that I have no leisure. I answer,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:64994:181"/>
Will you neglect God and Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you have worldly things to mind?
Whatever your business be, you have a
time to eat, and drink, and sleep; and
have you no time to be saved? Better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach
upon other things, than that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
should be cast to the Walls, or justled
out of your thoughts. <hi>David</hi> was a
King, and he had more distracting cares
than most of us have, or can have; yet
he saith, <hi>Psal. 119. 147, 148. I prevented
the dawning of the Morning; and cried, I
hoped in thy Word. Mine Eyes prevent
the Night-watches, that I may meditate in
thy Word.</hi> And, v. 164. <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Work that he alloweth you no time
for; but we waste our time, and then
God is straitned. Many poorer than you
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:64994:182"/>
have time, because they have an heart and
will to improve it.</p>
                  <p>4. I have no power or strength to do
good; And what will you have us do?
This is the excuse of the idle and naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Servant; Mat. 25. 24. <hi>I knew that thou
wert an hard Man, reaping where thou hast
not sowen, and gathering where thou hast
not strawed.</hi> God sets you about work,
but giveth you no strength, is your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>x<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse:
but certainly you can do more than
you do, but you will not make trial. God
may be more ready with the assistances of
his Grace thau you can imagine. The ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Man may complain of the length of
the way, but not the lazy, who will not
stir a foot. If you did make trial, you
would not complain of God, but your
selves, and beg Grace more f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>lingly. In
short, you are not able, because you are
not willing. And your impotency is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
by evil habits contracted, and long
custom in Sin.</p>
                  <p>I now proceed to the fourth Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
                  <p>4. None of these Excuses are sufficient
for not following of Christ. <hi>And that,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="355" facs="tcp:64994:182"/>1. Because of his Authority. Who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
this Duty from us, or imposeth it
on us? 'Tis the Lord Jesus Christ, to
whose Sentence we must stand or fall.
When he biddeth us follow him, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him speedily; to excuse our selves,
is to countermand and contradict his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority:
'Tis flat disobedience, though we
do not deny the Duty, but only shift off
and excuse our present complyance. For
he is as peremptory for the Time and
Season, as for the Duty. <hi>Now while 'tis
called to day, harden not your hearts,</hi> Heb.
3. 7, 8. God standeth upon his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and will have a present Answer. If he
say, To day, 'tis flat disobedience for us to
say, To morrow; or suffer me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>irst to do
this and that business.</p>
                  <p>2. It appeareth from his Charge to his
Messengers. Nothing can take off a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of the Gospel from seeking the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
and Salvation of Souls. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
plead any thing to exempt us from
this Work: to plead that the Peoples hearts
are hard, and that the Work is difficult
and full of danger, will not serve the
turn; no, <hi>Their Blood will I require at thy
hands.</hi> Therefore all excuses set aside,
we must address our selves to our work.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:64994:183"/>
Acts 20. 23, 24. <hi>Paul</hi> went bound in the
Spirit; and the Holy Ghost had told him,
that in every City Bonds and Afflictions
did abide and wait for him: But, saith he,
<hi>None of these things move me, neither count
I my Life dear to my self, so as I may finish
my course with joy, and the Ministry which I
have received of my Lord Iesus, to testify
the Gospel of the Grace of God.</hi> He was
willing and ready to endure what should
befal him at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and reckoned no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it, nor of loss of Life, if he
might successfully preach the Gospel, and
serve Christ faithfully in the Office of the
Ministry. If nothing be an excuse to us,
can any thing be an excuse to you?
Should your Souls be nearer and dearer
to us than to your selves?</p>
                  <p>3. It appeareth from the matter of the
Duty imposed on you: If you consider,

                     </gap>. The
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:64994:183"/>
Question will soon be reduced to this,
Which is most to be regarded, God or the
Creature, the Body or the Soul, Eternity
or Time? The Excuses are for the Body,
for Time, for the Creature; but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions
of Duty are for God, for the
Soul, and for Eternity. Sense saith, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the Flesh; Faith saith, Save thy
Soul: The one is of everlasting Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and conduceth to an happiness
that hath no end; the other only for a
time. 2 Cor. 4. 18. <hi>While we look not at
the things which are seen, but at the things
which are not seen: for the things which are
seen, are temporal; but the things which are
not seen, are eternal.</hi> One turn of the
Hand of God, separateth the neglected Soul
from the pampered Body: And then
whose are all these things?</p>
                  <p>2. The Necessity; that we may please
God, and enjoy him for ever. We can
never plead for a necessity of sinning, for
a Man is never driven to those streights,
whether he shall sin more or less; but
sometimes Duties come in competition,
Duty to a Father, and a special injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ's to follow him: One must be
subordinated to the other, and the most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
must take place; the less give
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:64994:184"/>
place to the greater. Now this is much
more true of those things which are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
pleaded by way of hesistancy, or as a
bar to our Duty; as our worldly and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
satisfactions. But you will say, We
must avoid poverty and shame. But it is
more necessary to avoid damnation. Not
to preserve our temporal Interests, but to
seek after eternal Life; Luke 10. 42. <hi>One
thing is necessary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. It appeareth from the nature of the
Work. To follow Christ, is not to give
to him as much as the Flesh can spare, but
wholly to devote your selves to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
to sell all for the Pearl of great
price, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 46. And you are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to walk so, that all may give way to
the Glory of God, and the Service of
your Redeemer. If he will imploy us
thus and thus, we must not contradict it,
or please any thing by way of excuse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> Do not neglect your Duty for
vain Excus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s. The excusing humour is
very rife, and very prejudicial to us, for the
Sluggard hath an high conceit of his own
Allegations: Prov. 26. 16. <hi>The Sluggard
is wiser in his own conceit, than seven</hi> Men
<hi>that can r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nder a reason.</hi> In the Eastern
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:64994:184"/>
Countries their Counsel usually consisted
of seven; as we read of the seven Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> Esther 1. 14.
Therefore let us a little disprove this vain
conceit. The Sluggard thinketh himself
so wise, that all others are but giddy and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>raisy-brain'd People, that are too nice
and scrupulous, and make more ado with
Religion than needeth: But can a Man do
too much for God and Heaven? 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.
12. The Sluggard thinketh 'tis a venture,
and he may venture on one side as well as
the other; but 'tis a thousand to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him in the eye of Reason, put aside
Faith: in doubtful Cases, the surest way is
to be taken. But to draw it to a more
certain determination.</p>
                  <p>1. Nothing is a reasonable excuse which
God's Word disproveth: for the Scriptures
were penned to discover the vain Sophisms
which are in the Hearts of Men. <hi>Heb. 4.
12. For the Word of God is quick and
powerful, and sharper than any two-edged
Sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder
of Soul and Spirit, and of the Ioints and
Marrow, and is a discerner of the Thoughts
and Intents of the Heart.</hi> To discover the
Affections of a sensual Heart, however
palliated with the pretences of a crafty
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:64994:185"/>
Understanding. Certainly our private
Conceits must not be lifted up against the
Wisdom of God, nor can a Creature be
justified in going against his Maker's Will.
Nothing can be Reason, which the God
of Wisdom contradicts and calleth Folly;
Jer. 8. 9. <hi>Lo, they have rejected the Word of
the Lord, and what Wisdom is in them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Nothing can be pleaded as a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Excuse, which your Consciences are
not satisfied is Reason. Men consult with
their Affections, rather than with their
Consciences. Conscience would draw
other Conclusions, therefore our Excuses
are usually our Aggravations: <hi>Luk. 19. 22.
Out of thy own mouth will I judg thee, thou
wicked Servant.</hi> The Master expected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
therefore he should have done
what he could; Job 15. 6. <hi>Thine own
Mouth condemneth thee;—yea, thine own Lips
testify against thee.</hi> That's the strongest
Conviction which ariseth from a Man's
own Bosom; that's the reason why there
are so many Appeals to Conscience in
Scripture; 1 Cor. 10. 15. <hi>I speak as to
wise Men, judg ye what I say.</hi> Your own
Hearts tell you, ye ought to be better;
to mind God more, and the World less;
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:64994:185"/>
to be more serious in preparing for your
eternal estate.</p>
                  <p>3. Nothing can be a reasonable Excuse
which reflects upon God, as if he had
made an hard Law which none can keep;
especially if urged against the Law of
Grace: This is to say, the Ways of God
are not equal; therefore there can be no
excuse for the total omission of necessary
Duties.</p>
                  <p>4. No Excuse can be reasonable, but
what you dare plead at the Bar of Christ:
for that is Reason, which will go for
Reason at last. Then the weight of all
Pleas will be considered, and all negligent
Persons that have not improved the Light
of Nature, or have not obeyed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
will be left without excuse. What
doth it avail Prisoners to set up a Mock-Sessions
among themselves to acquit one,
and condemn another? He is in a good
condition that shall be excused in the last
Judgment, and in a bad condition that
shall be condemned then.</p>
                  <p>I now proceed to the second Point.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That those who are called to
follow Christ, should follow him speedily,
without interposing any delays.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="362" facs="tcp:64994:186"/>Consider;</p>
                  <p>1. Ready Obedience, is a good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of a sound Impression of Grace left
upon our Hearts. There is slighter Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
which breedeth a sense of our
Duty, but doth not so strongly urge us to
the performance of it. And there is a
more sound Conviction, which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with a prevailing efficacy, and then
all Excuses and Delays are laid aside, and
Men kindly comply with God's Call. <hi>Cant.
1. 4. Draw me, I will run after thee, Run;</hi>
It noteth an earnest and speedy motion;
the Fruit of the powerful attraction of

When our Call is clear, there
needeth no debate or demurring upon the
Matter.</p>
                  <p>2. The Work goeth on the more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when we speedily obey the sanctifying
motions of the Spirit, and the present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:64994:186"/>
and impulsion of his Grace. You
have not such an advantage of a warm
conviction afterward: When the Waters
are stirred, then we must put in for a cure,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 4. To adjourn and put it off as
<hi>Foelix</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 15. doth damp and
cool the Work, you quench this holy Fire;
or to stand hucking with God, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
did, the Work dieth on your hand.</p>
                  <p>3. There is hazard in delaying and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off such a business of concernment,
as Conversion to God. Certainly this is
a business of the greatest concernment,
and the greatest Work should be first
thought of: [Mat. 6. 33. <hi>Seek first the
Kingdom of God, and the Righteousness
thereof.]</hi> and most thought of, <hi>Psal. 27.
4. One thing have I desired of the Lord,
that will I seek after, that I may dwell in
the House of the Lord.</hi> Now if we delay,
it is left upon great hazards. Life is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
for you know not what a day
may bring forth; Prov. 27. 1. <hi>Boast not
thy s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lf of to morrow; for thou knowest
not what a day may bring forth.</hi> If God
had given leave, (as Princes sometimes in
a Proclamation, for all to come in within a
certain day); so if God had said, Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
doth not repent till thirty of forty
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:64994:187"/>
Years be out, there were no great hazard
till the time were expired; we might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
Sin a little while longer: But we
know not the day of our death, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we should get God to bless us er'e we
die. A new Call is uncertain, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.
1, 2. It may be he will treat with us no
more in such a warm and affectionate
manner. If he call, yet not vouchsafe
such assistances of his Grace, if peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
God will give them repentance unto
Life, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. 'Tis an hazard or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
if the Spirit of God will put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
thought of turning into your
hearts, when former Grace is despised.
Isa. 55. 6. <hi>Call upon the Lord while he is
near, and seek him while he may be found.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Consider the mischiefs of delaying;
every day we contract a greater indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of embracing God's Call. We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
now 'tis hard: if it be hard to day,
it will be harder to morrow, when God
is more provoked, and Sin more strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 13. 23. Yea, it may be, our
natural Faculties are decayed, the vigor
of our Youth exhausted. When the tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
is spoiled, and the Ship rotten, it is
an ill time to put to Sea. <hi>Eccles. 12. 1.
Remember now thy Creator in the days of
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:64994:187"/>
thy Youth.</hi> And besides, consider the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion
that is upon a late Repentance.
The most prophane would have God for
their portion at last.</p>
                  <p>5. The Reasons for delay are inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable.
Suppose it be our satisfaction in
our present estate. The Pleasures of Sin
are sweet, and we are loth to forgo them;
but those Pleasures must one day be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
or you are for ever miserable;
Why not now? Sin will be as sweet to
the carnal Appetite hereafter as now it is;
and Salvation is dispensed upon the same
terms; you cannot be saved hereafter with
less ado, or bring down Christ and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to a lower rate. If this be a Reason
now, it will for ever lie as a Reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Christ, and against Conversion.
The Laws of Christianity are unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
always the same, and your Hearts
not like to be better. Or is it, That you
are willing now, but you have no leasure;
when such encumbrances are over, you
shall get your Hearts into a better po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture!
Oh no, 'tis hypocrisy to think you
are willing, when you delay. Nothing
now hindreth, but a want of Will; and
when God treateth with thee about thine
eternal Peace, it is the best time; but God
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:64994:188"/>
always cometh to the Sinner unseasonably
in his own account. But consider, it
was the Devil that said, <hi>Mat. 8. 29. Art
thou come hither to torment us before the
time?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Vse</hi> is, 1. To reprove that dally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with God in the Work of Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is so common and so natural
to us.</p>
                  <p>The Causes of it are,</p>
                  <p>1. Unbelief, or want of a due sense
and sight of things to come. If Men
were perswaded of eternal Life, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Death; they would not stand ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
between Heaven and Hell, but
presently engage their Hearts to draw
nigh to God: But we cannot see afar off;
2 Pet. 1. 9. <hi>He that lacketh these things, is
blind, and cannot see afar off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Another cause is Security. They do
not take these things into their serious
thoughts. Faith sheweth 'tis sure, and
Consideration bringeth it near; <hi>Amos 6.
3. Ye put far away the evil day.</hi> Things at
a distance do not move us. We should
pray, and preach, and practise, as if Death
were at our backs. And remember, that
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:64994:188"/>
all our Security dependeth upon the slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Thread of a frail Life.</p>
                  <p>3. Another cause is, Aversness of Heart,
they have no mind to these things; <hi>Rom.
8. 7. The carnal Mind is enmity against
God.</hi> The Heart is inclined to worldly
Vanities, set against God and Godliness.
Now let us consider the hainousness of
this Sin. 'Tis ingratitude and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
for God's eternal Love; <hi>Psal. 103.
17. The Mercy of the Lord is from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
to everlasting upon them that fear
him.</hi> 'Tis also disingenuity; we would
be heard presently; Psal. 102. 2. <hi>Lord,
hear me speedily.</hi> To day is the season of
Mercy, to morrow of Duty. We are
always in haste, would have the Lord to
tarry for our sinful leisure, when we will
not tarry his holy leisure. 'Tis also base
Self-love, we can be content to dishonour
God longer, provided at length we may
be saved. Lastly, It is great injustice to
keep God out of his Right, he hath been
long enough kept out of his Right alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
1 Pet. 4. 3. <hi>The time past of our Life may
suffice to have wrought the Will of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
Therefore let us no longer delay,
but speedily address our selves to entertain
the Motions of the Holy Spirit.</p>

                  <p>WE are now come to the third In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
wherein we are instructed
how to avoid Miscarriages in following
Christ.</p>
                  <p>The first Instance teaches us to beware
of hasty and hypocritical Profession,
which is the Fruit of Resolution without
Deliberation, or sitting down and count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Charges; this was the fault of the
Scribe.</p>
                  <p>The second Instance cautioneth us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
dilatory Shifts and Excuses. The
most necessary Business must not be put
off upon any pretence whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>The third Instance forbiddeth all
thoughts of compounding, or hopes to
have Christ and the World too. As this
Man hoped first to secure his worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and then to follow Christ at leisure.
Whether this Man were called, or uncal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
it appeareth not. 'Tis only said in
the Text <hi>[Another also said];</hi> the middle
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:64994:189"/>
Person was only called by Christ; the
other two offered themselves. The first
was forward upon a mistaken Ground, to
share the Honours of the Kingdom of the
<hi>Messiah,</hi> which he supposed to be Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral.
This last offereth himself, but his
Heart was not sufficiently loosned from
the World. From both we see, That <hi>it
is not in him that willeth, nor in him that
runneth, but God that sheweth Mercy,</hi> Rom.
7. 16. For neither of those that offered
themselves are accepted.</p>
                  <p>In the words you may observe;
<list>
                        <item>1. His Request.</item>
                        <item>2. Christ's Answer.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. His Request. This third offereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be a Disciple of Christ; but with
an Exception, That he might take his fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
at home, and dispose of his Estate
there, and so secure his wordly Interests.
—<hi>I will follow thee, but let me bid those
farewel which are at home in my House.</hi> You
will say, what harm is in this Request?
<hi>Elijah</hi> granted it to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

21. When he had laid his Mantle on him,

go home and salute his Friends.</p>
                  <p>I Answer;</p>
                  <p>1. The Evangelical Ministry exceedeth
the Prophetical, both as to Excellency
and Necessity, and must be gone about
speedily without any delay. The Harvest
was great, and such an extraordinary
Work was not to be delayed nor inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
                  <p>2. If two Men do the same thing, it
followeth not, that they do it with the
same mind. Things may be the same, as
to the substance or matter of the Action,
yet Circumstances may be different. Christ
knew this Man's Heart, and could inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
the meaning of his desire to go home
first. He might make it a pretence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
clean away from Christ. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

cannot distinguish, God, that knoweth the
secrets of all hearts, can distinguish.</p>
                  <p>3. Those that followed Christ on these
extraordinary Calls, were to leave all
things they had, without any farther care
about them; Matth. 10. 21. <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

He s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ith unto them, Follow me, and I will
make you Fishers of Men; and they strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
left their Nets and followed him. <hi>So,</hi>
Matth. 9. 9. As Iesus passed forth from
thence, he saw a Man named <hi>Matthew,</hi> sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at the receipt of custom; and he saith
unto him, Follow me. And he arose and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him. <hi>Therefore it was preposterous
for this Man to desire to go home, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and dispose of his Estate and Family,
before he complied with his Call.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. In Resolution, Estimation, and Vow.
The same is required of all Christians,
when Christ's Work calleth for it. <hi>Luke
14. 33. So likewise whosoever he be of you,
that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot
be my Disciple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Christ's Answer. Which consists of
a Similitude, and its Interpretation joined
together.</p>
                  <p>1. The Metaphor or Similitude: Taken
from Ploughmen, who cannot make
streight Furrows if they look back: So to
look back, after we have undertaken
Christ's Yoke and Service, rendreth us
unfit for the Kingdom of God. Putting
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:64994:191"/>
our hands to the Plough, is to undertake
Christ's Work, or to resolve to be his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
Looking back, noteth an hank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Mind a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ter the World; and also
a return to the worldly Life. For, first,
we look back, and then we go back:
First, we have an over-valuing of the
World, and then we return to the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> That looking back will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
those who have set their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Heavenward.</p>
                  <p>We have an Instance in the Text of a
Man which pretended to follow Christ,
which is to set our Faces Heavenward,
(for we follow Christ, first in Labour and
Patience, and then into Glory): But he
would look back, and had many thoughts
of what he had left at home: And he is
pronounced un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The first sort of those,</p>

the Cares, Pleasures, and vain Pomp
thereof. Certainly all that would follow
Christ, must renounce their worldly Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Inclinations, or else they can
make no work of Christianity. I prove
it from the Nature of Conversion, which
is a turning from the Creature to God,
from self to Christ, and from Sin to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.
The first is proper to our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

As our degeneration was a falling from
God to the Creature, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 13. so our
Regeneration is a turning from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to God. If we leave the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly,

progress in the Duties of the Holy and
Heavenly Life. So the Apostle telleth us,
Phil. 3. 13. <hi>But this one thing I do, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
those things which are behind, and
reaching forth unto those things which are
before,</hi> &amp;c. Farther progress in Holiness, is
the one thing that we should mind, and that
above all other things. This is the <hi>unum
necessarium,</hi> Luke 10. 42. The <hi>Primum,</hi>
or <hi>Principium;</hi> the one thing, that is the
main thing. Psal. 27. 4. <hi>One thing have I
desired of the Lord, that will I seek after.</hi>
But how should we mind it? Not looking
to the things which are behind, but look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the things which are before. The
things behind, are our imperfect begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
or so much of the race as we have
overcome and got through. 'Tis the
Sluggard's trick, to consider how much of
the Journey is past, or how far the rest of
the Racers are behind him. But he that sets
heartily to his Business, considers how
much is before, that he may get through
the remainder of his Race, and so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Prize. The Things which are
before us, are God, and Heaven, and the
remaining Duties of the Holy Life. These
we should mind, and not look back, as satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:64994:194"/>
our selves with what we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to already.</p>
                  <p>2. How ill it becometh those that have
put their hands to the Spiritual Plough.</p>
                  <p>1. In respect of the Covenant into
which they enter, or the manner of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into it; which is by a fixed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
resignation of themselves unto
God. Till this be done, we are but half
Christians: As suppose we desire Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
would have God to be our God,
but neglect Duties, and are loth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his People; or, suppose we see a
necessity of that, and so are in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
willing to give up our selves to him:
yet if our resolution be not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ixed, or be
not unbounded without reserves, and
against all reserves, the Covenant is not
condescended unto; we do nothing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we do that which is farther required
of us.</p>
                  <p>(1.) If it be not fixed, but wavering, we do

exhorted them all, that with full purpose of
Heart they would cleave unto the Lord:</hi> It
implieth such a resolution as carrieth the

Inclinations; Acts 26. 28. <hi>Almost

is resolved to stick to his Servants, and
therefore he expects that they should be
resolved to stick to him.</p>
                  <p>(2.) If it be not unbounded, reserving
nothing, but leaving all to Christ, to be
disposed of at his Will. Except but one
thing, and the Covenant is not fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
it sticketh at that Article: 'tis but

God: Resolving with reserves is no reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution

14. 28. Now none of this can be as long
as you look back, or allow that, that will
tempt you to look back; that is, till you
be throughly loosned from the World;
for whilst the Heart cleaveth to any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thing, your resolution is unfixed: They
that only take Christ upon liking, will

ways; And your resolution is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded,
whilst you set upon the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:64994:195"/>
of Religion, and yet keep the World,
or something of the World, your Heart
will ever and anon be seeking occasions
to withdraw; for you were false at heart
at your first setting out, and treacherous
in the very making of your Covenant.</p>
                  <p>2. With respect to the Duties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity;
or that part of the Kingdom of

                  <p>A threefold Defect there will be in our

                  </list>
                  <p>1. Your Duty will be unpleasant to

so that you can never yield ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and ready obedience to God. Certain it
is, that we must serve God, and serve him
with delight; his Commandments should
be kept, and they should not be grievous
to us, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 3. Now what is the great
Impediment? Worldly Lusts are not
throughly purged out of the heart; for
presently he addeth this reason, <hi>For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:64994:195"/>
is born of God, overcometh the World.</hi>
'Tis an hard Heart maketh our work hard;
and the Heart is hard and unperswadable,
when our Affections are ingaged else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
The readiness of our Obedience
dependeth on the fervency of our Love;
the fervency of our Love, on our victory
over the World; our victory over the
World, on the strength of our Faith;
the strength of our Faith, on the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
we have of the principal Object of our
Faith; the principal Object of our Faith
is, That Jesus is the Son of God, whose
Counsel we must take, if we will be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
And the evidence of that Principle,
is the double Testimony or Attestation
given to him from Heaven, or in the
Heart of a Believer. Once settle in that, that
you can intirely trust your selves, and all
your Interests, in the hands of Christ, and
all Duties will be easy.</p>

<hi>hath forsaken me, having loved this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

to mind his own privat Affairs. The
love of Riches, Pleasure, Ease, and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if they be not thorowly renounced,
will tempt us to a like revolt and neglect
of God. Therefore to prevent it, when
we first put our hands to the Plough, we
must resolve to renounce the World. <hi>Psal.</hi>
45. 10.—<hi>Forget also thine own People, and
thy Father's House.</hi> Look back no more;
as long as we are intangled in our Lusts
and Inticements of the World, we are
unmeet to serve God. <hi>Paul</hi> counted those
things that were gain to him, to be loss
for Christ, <hi>Philip. 3. 7, 8. Yea doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and I count all things but loss, for
the excellency of the Knowledg of Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
my Lord, for whom I have suffered the
loss of all things, and count them but Dung,
that I may win Christ. Paul</hi> repented not
of his Choice, but sheweth his perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in the contempt of the World; <hi>I
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:64994:196"/>
have counted, and do count.</hi> He seeth no
cause to recede from his Choice. Many
affect Novelties, are transported at their
first Change, but repent at leisure.</p>
                  <p>3. We are imperfect in it; I mean, to
such a degree, as to want sincerity, for
they bring nothing to perfection, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.
14. Their Fruit never groweth ripe, or
sound; for Religion is an underling. Some
good Inclinations they have to heavenly
things, but their worldly Affections are
greater, and overtop them so, that though
they do not plainly revolt from their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
yet their Duties want that Life
and Power which is necessary; so that
they bring little honour to Christ by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christians.</p>
                  <p>3. In respect of the hurt that cometh
from their looking back; both to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and to Religion.</p>
                  <p>1. To themselves. 2 Pet. 2. 20, 21. <hi>For
if after they have escaped the Pollutions of
the World, through the knowledg of our Lord
and Saviour Iesus Christ, they are again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
therein, their latter end is worse with
them than their beginning; for it had been
better for them not to have known the way of
Righteousness, than after they have known it,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:64994:197"/>
to turn from the Holy Commandment deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to them.</hi> Many have so much of the
knowledg of Christ, as to cleanse their
external Conversation. But Sin and the
World were never so effectually cast out,
but they are in secret League with them
still; and therefore they are first intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled,
and then overcome; first enticed by
some Pleasure or Profit, and then carried
away with the Temptation. But what
cometh of this? <hi>Their lattar end is worse
than their beginning.</hi> Their Sin is gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ter,
since they sin against Light and Taste;
their Judgment is greater, both Spiritual
and Eternal. As God giveth them over
to brutish Lusts, and to the Power of Satan.
And this will be a cutting thought to them
to all Eternity, to remember how they
lost their acquaintance with, and benefit
by Christ, by looking back to the World,
and deserting that good way wherein they
found so much sweetness in Christ.</p>
                  <p>2. The Mischief which is done to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
They wonderfully dishonour God,
and bring contempt upon the Ways of
Godliness, when after they have made
trial of it, they prefer Sin before it; as
if God had wearied them, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6. 3.
Therefore 'tis just with God to vindicate
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:64994:197"/>
his Honour. And Satan, after he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be for a while rejected, taketh a
more durable possession of them, <hi>Luke</hi>
11. 26. O think of this often! to look
back after we seemed to escape, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
us in the greater Sin and Misery:
Better never to have yielded to God so far,
than to retract at last; partly, because
their Sins are Sins against Knowledg. <hi>Luk.
12. 47. That Servant which knew his Lord's
Will, and prepared not himself, neither did
according to his Will, shall be beaten with
many stripes.</hi> Partly, because they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful
for so much deliverance by the
knowledg of Christ as they received; and
that's an hainous aggravation of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
Partly, because their Sin is Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
and breach of Vows; for they
turned the back upon the World, and all
the Allurements thereof, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the Covenant, and resolved to
follow Christ in all Conditions, till he
should bring them into a place of Rest
and Safety. Partly, because they sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Experience, after they have had
some relish and taste of better things, <hi>Heb.</hi>
6. 4. Partly, because their Conversion
again is the more difficult, the Devil having
a greater hold of them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 44.</p>

                     <pb n="386" facs="tcp:64994:198"/>4. With respect to the disproportion that
is between the things that tempt us to look
back, and those things that are set before
us.</p>
                  <p>1. The things that tempt us to look
back, are the Pleasures of Sin, and the
Profits of the World; both are but a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pory
injoyment; <hi>Heb. 11. 25. The Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Sin, which are but for a Season.</hi> The
pleasures of Sin are base and brutish,
which captivate and bring a slavery on the
Soul, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 3. The enjoiments of the
World cannot last long; your gust and
relish of them, within a little while will
be gone, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 17. yet these are the
things that tempt you to forget and draw
you off from God: And will you marry
your Souls again to those Sins from which
they were once divorced, and for such pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
Vanities repent of your Obedience to
God, even after you have made trial of
him? Are these things grown better, or
God grown worse, that you should turn
your Hearts from him to them?</p>
                  <p>2. The things that are before you, are
God, and Heaven; Reconciliation with
God, and the everlasting Fruition of him
in Glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="387" facs="tcp:64994:198"/>1. Reconciliation with God, with the
consequent Benefits; Communion with
God now, Peace of Conscience, the Gift
of the Spirit, and the Hopes of Glory.
If there were no more than these, Shall
we look back? Can we find better things
in the World? Alas! there is nothing
here, but Fears and Snares, a vexatious
Uncertainty, and polluting Injoyments,
such as may easily make us worse, but
cannot make us better. What is this, but
to forsake the cold flowing Waters for a
dirty Puddle? <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. 14. Our own
Mercies for lying Vanities, <hi>Ionah</hi> 2. 8.</p>
                  <p>2. The everlasting Fruition of him in
Glory. Shall we look back that are stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
for a Crown of endless Glory, as if
we were weary of the pursuit, and give it
over as an hopeless or fruitless Business?
If Christ will lead us to this Glory, let us
follow him, and go on in what is well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
without looking back. Never let
us leave a Crown of Glory, for a Crown
of Thorns.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 1. Is for Instruction, to teach us
what to do if we would set about the
strict practice of Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="388" facs="tcp:64994:199"/>1. See that your worldly Love be well
mortified: For till you be dead to the
World, God cannot recover his Interest
in your Souls, nor the Divine Nature be
set up there with any Life and Power,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. see also 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 15. and
1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 4. Till this be done, God and
Glory cannot be your ultimate End, nor
the main design of your Life; for the
World will turn your Hearts another
way, and will have the principal ruling
and disposing of your Lives: The World
will have that Love, Trust, Care, and
Service, that belongeth to God, and be a
great hindrance to you in the way to
Heaven, and you will never have peace.
The World doth first delude you, and
then disquiet you. And if you cleave
to it as your Portion, you must look for
no more. Well then, mortified it must
be; For how can you renounce the
World as an Enemy, if your Hearts be
not weaned from it so far, that it is a more
indifferent thing to you to have it, or
want it, and that you be not so eager for
it, or so careful about it?</p>
                  <p>2. Let not the World steal into your
Hearts again, nor se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:64994:199"/>
our remaining-Folly, and backsliding-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that is ever looking to the World
which we have forsaken. Now when you
find this, whenever the World hath insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated
into your Affections, and chilled
and cooled them to God and Heaven, see
that the Distemper be presently expelled;
pray, as <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 119. 36. <hi>Incline my
Heart unto thy Testimonies, and not unto
Covetousness.</hi> Be sure to be more fruitful
in good Works; Luke 11. 41. <hi>Give Alms
of such things as you have, and behold all
things are clean unto you.</hi> We renounced
the World in our Baptismal Vow, we
overcame the World in our whole after-course.
'Tis not so got out of any, but
that we still need an holy jealousy and
watchfulness over our selves. Now that
we may do both of these, I shall give you
some Directions.</p>
                  <p>1. Fix your End and Scope, which is
to be everlastingly happy in the injoyment
of God: The more you do so, the less
in danger you will be of looking back.
We are often pressed to lay up Treasures
in Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 20. And, as those that
are risen with Christ, to seek the things
which are above, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1. Our Lord
himself saith to the young Man, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:64994:200"/>
21. <hi>Go, sell all that thou hast, and give to the
Poor, and thou shalt have Treasures in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
If our Life and Business be for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and your mind be kept intent on the
greater Matters of Everlasting Life, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will divert you therefrom; you will
almost be ready to forget Earth, because you
have higher and better things to mind.
'Tis not barely thinking of the Troubles
of the World, or confessing its Vanities,
will cure your Distempers, but the true
sight of a better Happiness. A little in
hand is better, you will think, than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
Hopes; but a sound Belief, <hi>which
is the substance of things hoped for, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of things not seen,</hi> that openeth
Heaven to you, and will soon make you
of another mind.</p>
                  <p>2. Intirely trust your self, and all your
Concernmen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s in the Hand of God. Christ
expected from all those whom he called in
an extraordinary manner, that they should
leave all without any thought or solicitude
about it, trusting in him not only for
their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ternal Reward, but for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
and Protection by the way during
their service. And the same in effect is
required of all Christians, not to leave
our Estates, or neglect our Calling; but
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:64994:200"/>
renouncing the World, and resolving to
take such a lot in good part, as he shall
carve out to them. All that enter into
Covenant with God, must believe him to
be God All-sufficient, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. The
Apostle when he diswadeth from Worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
he produceth a promise of God's
not forsaking us, and leaving us utterly
destitute; Heb. 13. 5. <hi>Let your Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be without Covetousness, and be content
with such things as you have. For he hath
said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake
thee.</hi> On the other side, certainly 'tis Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
that is the cause of Apostacy, or
falling back from God; Heb. 3. 12. <hi>Take
heed, Brethren, lest there be in any of you an
evil Heart of Vnbelief, in departing from the
living God.</hi> Certainly when we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
up our selves to Christ to do his
Work, we may trust him boldly, and
serve him chearfully, we need not look
back to shift for our selves. If you are
willing to be his People, he will be your
God, and your Saviour, and then you
may conclude, <hi>that God, even our God shall
bless us,</hi> Psalm. 67. 6. He will not be
wanting to those that unreservedly yield
up themselves to his Obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="392" facs="tcp:64994:201"/>3. Consider that they are deluded Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
that will meddle no farther with
Religion, than they can reconcile it with
their worldly Happiness: What-ever glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Notions they have of God, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of admiring free Grace; 'tis Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
that Christ calleth for; and taking up
our Cross, is the first Lesson in his School.
And true Conversion is a turning from the
Creature to God, and beginneth in Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification;
and Baptism implieth a renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
of the Devil, the World, and the
Flesh. Therefore those that will save their
wordly State, and launch out no farther
in the Cause of Religion, than they may
easily get ashore again when a storm com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
and love and serve God no farther
than will stand with the contentment of
the Flesh; and divide their Hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and the World, give God but
half, and the worst half; surely these
were never sincere with God. 'Tis an
impossible Design they drive on, to serve
<hi>two Masters,</hi> Mat. 6. 24. You must let
go Christ, and Glory, if you be so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
after the World, and so indulgent to
the Flesh.</p>
                  <p>4. Consider how much 'tis your busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to observe what maketh you fit, or
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:64994:201"/>
unfit for the Kingdom of God. The apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
or inaptitude of means is to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with respect to the end; as they help
or hinder the attainment of your great
End: For, <hi>Finis, est mensura mediorum:</hi>
Mat. 6. 22. <hi>The Light of the Body is the
Eye; If therefore thine Eye be single, thy
whole Body shall be full of Light.</hi> Now
our great end, is to enjoy God for ever.
And what fitteth you for this, looking
back, or keeping the Heart in Heaven?
Experience will shew. The observant
and watchful Christian will soon find
where his great hindrance lieth. How
much he findeth his Heart down by mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the World, and how he needeth to
wind it up again, by Faith and Love:
Psal. 25. 1. <hi>Vnto thee, O Lord, do I lift
up my Soul.</hi> The World is the great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
that keepeth him from God, and
indisposeth him for his Service; dampeth
his Love, and quencheth his Zeal, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bateth
his Diligence; he will soon find
how much more he might do for God, if
he could draw off his Heart more from
those inferior Objects: This is the weight
that presseth us down, and maketh us so
cold and cursory in God's Service.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="394" facs="tcp:64994:202"/>5. Consider, in the Text, here is the
Kingdom of God; which is double; The
Kingdom of Grace, and the Kingdom of
Glory. The one is called, <hi>The Kingdom
and Patience of Iesus Christ,</hi> Rev. 1. 9.
The other is called, <hi>His Kingdom and
Glory,</hi> 1 Thess. 2. 12. By the first, we
are prepared for the second; and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is the great Incouragement. Now
they that look back, are unfit for either;
the Duties of Christians, or the Reward
of Christians; he slincheth from his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
here, and shall be shut out of Heaven
at last: 2 Thess. 1. 5.—<hi>That ye may be
counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for
which ye also suffer.</hi> They are only coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
worthy, who constantly and patiently
look for it, and venture something on
it.</p>
                  <p>6. Consider the great loss you will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
by looking back after you have put
your hand to the Plough. You will lose
all that you have wrought, and all that
you have suffered.</p>
                  <p>1. What you have wrought; 2 <hi>Ep.
Iohn 8. Look to your selves, that ye lose
not the things which ye have wrought, but
that ye receive a full Reward.</hi> You forfeit
the Reward of your good Beginnings. A
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:64994:202"/>
partial Reward they may have in this
Life, while they continue their well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
(for no Man is a loser by God);
but not a Compleat and full Reward till
the Life to come. Some overflowings of
God's Temporal Bounty they may have,
but not the Crown of Life and Glory.
So, <hi>Ezek. 18. 24. All his Righteousness that
he hath done, shall not be mentioned.</hi> All is
obliterated, and forgotten, and made void,
as to any Interest in the great Reward.
This was represented in the Type of the
<hi>Nazarite,</hi> Numb. 6. 12. <hi>The days that were
before shall be lost, because his separation was
defiled.</hi> He was to begin all anew.</p>
                  <p>2. All that you have suffered; as a
Man may make some petty losses for Jesus
Christ. Gal. 3. 4. <hi>Have ye suffered so
many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.</hi>
This maketh all the cost and expence that
you have been at, to be to no purpose.</p>

                     <hi>Doct.</hi> That a true and sound Faith, will
cause us to save the Soul, though with

                  <p>1 Pet. 1. 5. <hi>Ye are kept by the Power of

the Power of God indeed that keepeth:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64994:205"/>
He that reserveth Heaven for us, reserveth
and keepeth us for Heaven. But by what
Instrument or Means? By Faith; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon an Invisible God, for an Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
that lieth in an invisible World;
when in the mean time he permitteth us to
be harrased with Difficulties and Troubles,
requireth Faith: And by Faith alone can
the Heart be upheld, till we obtain this
Salvation. So, <hi>vers. 9. Receiving the End
of your Faith, the Salvation of your Souls.</hi>
'Tis Faith maketh us row against the

Cravings, that we may obtain eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
at length. The Flesh is for sparing
and favouring the Body; but Faith is for

of Faith.</p>
                  <p>To make this evident to you;

for the saving of the Soul. <hi>Mat.
10. 39. He that findeth his Life, shall lose
it: and he that loseth his Life for my sake,

                     </gap>6. 25, 26. The saving of the
Soul, is more than the getting, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or having of all the World. For the
World concerneth only the Body, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Life; but the saving of Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth
Eternal Life. If Life be lost Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally,
'tis secured to Eternity, when
we shall have a Life which no Man can
take from us. And the Case standeth thus,
That either we must bring Eternal Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon our selves, or else obtain Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Salvation. They that are thrifty of
Life bodily, and the Comforts and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of it, are certainly prodigal of their
Salvation. But on the other side; If we
are willing to venture Life Temporal, and
all the Interests thereof, for the saving of
the Soul, we make a good Bargain; That
which is left for a while, is preserved to
us for for ever. In short, so much as God
is to be preferred before the Creature,
Heaven before the World, the Soul before
the Body, Eternity before Time, so much
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64994:206"/>
doth it concern us to have the better part
safe. And as Men in a great Fire, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Conflagration, will hazard their
Lumber to preserve their Treasure, their
Mony, or their Jewels: So should we take
care, that if we must lose one or other,
that the better part be out of hazard:
And what-ever we lose by the way, we
may be sure to come well to the end of
our Journey.</p>
                  <p>2. That nothing will make us hazard
all things, for the purchasing, or acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Salvation of the Soul, but only
Faith. The Flesh is importunate to be
pleased: Sense saith to us, Favour thy
self, that is, spare the Flesh; But Faith
saith, Save thy Soul. Faith, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
things future and invisible,
will teach us to value all things according
to their worth, and to lose some present
satisfaction, for that future and eternal
Gain which the Promises of God do offer
to us. Now Faith doth this two ways;
By convincing us of the <hi>Worth,</hi> and of
the <hi>Truth</hi> of things promised by God
through Christ. The Apostle when he
bloweth his Trumpet, and summoneth our
reverence, and attentive regard to the
Gospel; in that Preface, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64994:207"/>
saith, <hi>This is a faithful saying, and worthy
of all acceptation, that Iesus Christ came into
the World to save Sinners.</hi> Salvation by
Christ is worthy to be regarded above all
things: And if it be true, all things should
give place unto it. Now Faith convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
us of the Worth and Truth, and
maketh us to take the thing promised for
all our Treasure and Happiness; and the
Promise it self, or the Word of God, for
our whole security.</p>
                  <p>1. It maketh us to take the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
for all our Treasure and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
Mat. 6. 19, 20, 21. <hi>Lay not up for
your selves Treasures upon Earth, where
Moth and Rust doth corrupt, and where
Thieves break through and steal. But lay
up for your selves Treasure in Heaven, where
neither Moth nor Rust doth corrupt, nor
Thieves break through and steal. For
where your Treasure is, there your Heart
will be also.</hi> It highly concerneth us to
consider what we make our Treasure.
Worldly things are subject to many Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
and dese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve not our love nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem;
only heavenly things deserve to
be our Treasure. If our Hearts be set
upon these things, 'tis a sign we value
what Christ hath offered. So, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64994:207"/>
18. <hi>While we look not at the things which
are seen, but at the things which are not
seen: for the things which are seen, are Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral;
but the things which are not seen, are
Eternal.</hi> We make these things our End,
aud Scope, and Happiness. 'Tis easy to
prove the worth of these things in the
general, as 'tis easy to prove that Eternity
is better than Time; that things incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,
are better than those which are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to corruption: That things exempted
from Casualty, are better than those things
which are liable to Casualty, and are not
out of the reach of Robbery and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
But to Creatures wedded to sense
and present enjoyment, 'tis difficult and
hard to cause them to set their Hearts in
another World, and to lay up their Hopes
in Heaven, and to part with all things
which they see and love, and find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
to their Senses, for that God and
Glory which they never saw. This is the
Business of Faith, or the Work of the
Spirit of Illumination changing their
Hearts and Minds. This general Truth
all will determine, as that things Eternal,
are better than things Temporal. But
we undervalue these gracious Promises,
whose accomplishment must with patience
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64994:208"/>
be expected, whilst their future Goodness
cometh in actual competition with these
bodily Delights which we must forgo,
and those grievous bodily Afflictions which
we must endure out of sincere respect to
Christ and his Ways. Therefore before
there can be any true self-denial, Faith
must incline us to this offered Benefit, as
our true Treasure and Happiness, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we forgo, or undergo to attain it.</p>
                  <p>2. For the truth of it, the Word of
God must be our whole security, as being
enough to support our Hearts in waiting
for it, however God cover himself with
Frowns, and an appearance of Anger, in
those Afflictions which befal us in the way
thither. The Word of God is all in all
to his People: <hi>Thy Testimonies have I taken
as my Heritage for ever: they are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing
of my Soul,</hi> Psal. 119. 111. If a
Man hath little ready Mony, yet if he
have an Heritage to live upon, or sure
Bonds, he is well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>paid: So is a Believer
rich in Promises; which being the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of the Almighty and Immutable
God, and built upon the everlasting Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ, are as good to him as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
and therefore cause joy in
some Proportion as if the things were in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64994:208"/>
hand; Heb. 11. 13. <hi>These all died in Faith,
not having received the Promises, but having
seen then afar off, and were perswaded of
them, and embraced them.</hi> And, <hi>Psalm.
56. 4. In God will I praise his Word, in
God have I put my trust, I will not fear what
Man can do unto me.</hi> Faith resteth upon
God's Word, who is able to save to the
uttermost all that come to him by Christ.</p>
                  <p>1. Vse <hi>is Information concerning a
weighty Truth; namely, what the Faith
is by which the Just do live.</hi> 'Tis such a
trust or confidence in God's Promises of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life through Iesus Christ, as that we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
all other hopes and happiness whatsoever,
that we may obtain it.</p>
                  <p>To make good this Description to you,
let me observe,</p>
                  <p>1. That Faith looketh mainly to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
or the saving of the Soul, as the prime
Benefit offered to us by Jesus Christ. For
all attend to this; 1 Tim. 1. 16. <hi>For
a Pattern to them who should hereafter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
on him to life everlasting.</hi> This was
that they chiefly aimed at, and therefore
called <hi>the End of our Faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 9.
For this end were the Scriptures written;
John 20. 31. <hi>These things are written that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64994:209"/>
ye might believe, that Iesus is the Christ, the
Son of God, and that believing ye might
have Life through his Name.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are writ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>en, to direct us to know
Christ aright, who is the Kernel and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of all the Scriptures, who is the great
Subject of the Gospel; and that the chief
Benefit we have by him, is eternal Life,
by which all our Pains and losses for
Christ are recompenced, and from whence
we fetch our Comfort all along during the
course of our Pilgrimage, and upon the
hopes of which the Life of Grace is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on, and the Temptations of Sense
are defeated; so that this is the main Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
which Faith aimeth at.</p>
                  <p>2. That the sure grounds which Faith
goeth upon, is God's Promise through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ; and so it implieth.</p>
                  <p>(1.) That there is a God, who is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder
of them that diligently seek him:
for the Apostle pursuing this Discourse,
telleth us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. That a Man must
believe God's Being and Bounty, before
he can do any thing to the purpose for
him.</p>
                  <p>(2.) That this God hath revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in Jesus Christ, as willing to accept
poor Creatures who refuse not his New
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64994:209"/>
Covenant and remedying-Grace, to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and Life. For the guilty Creature
would stand at a distance, and not receive
his Offers with any comfort and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
had not God been in Christ reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the World to himself, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19.
But now they may be invited to come to
him with hope, <hi>vers.</hi> 20. And his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Promises standing upon such a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
and foundation, are the sooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved;
2 Cor. 1. 20. <hi>For the Promises of
God are in him Yea, and in him Amen, to
the Glory of God by us;</hi> that is, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of God propounded in Christ's
Name, are undoubtedly true; they are
not Yea and Nay, but Yea, and Amen:
They do not say Yea to Day, and Nay to
Morrow; but always Yea so it is, and
Amen, so it shall be; because they stand
upon an immutable Foundation, the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Merit and Redemption of Christ.</p>
                  <p>(3.) It implieth, That the Scriptures
which contain these Offers and Promises,
are the Word of God: For though God's
Veracity be unquestionable, how shall we
know that we have his Word; 'tis laid
at Pledg with us in the Scriptures, which
are the Declaration of the Mind of the
Eternal God. The Promises are a part of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64994:210"/>
those Sacred Scriptures which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit,
and sealed with a multitude of Miracles,
and bare the very Image and Superscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God, (as every thing which hath
past his Hand, hath his Signature upon
it, even to a Gnat or Pile of Grass) and
have been received and preserved by the
Church, as the certain Oracles of God,
and blessed by him throughout all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Successions of Ages, to the
convincing, converting, sanctifying, and
comforting of many Souls: And carry
their own Light, Evidence, and Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
to the Consciences of all those
who are not strangely perverted by their
brutish Lusts, and blinded by their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Affections: For the Apostle saith, <hi>By
the manifestation of the Truth, commending
our selves to every Man's Conscience. For
if our Gospel be hid, 'tis hid to those who
are lost: The God of this World having
blinded their Eyes, lest the Light of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Gospel should shine unto them,</hi> 2 Cor.
4. 2, 3, 4. Upon these grounds doth
Faith proceed, which I have mentioned
the more distinctly, that you might know
how to excite Faith; for besides praying
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64994:210"/>
for the Spirit of Wisdom and Illumination
to open our Eyes, we must use the means,
both as rational Creatures, and new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
And what Means are more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
than those mentioned?</p>
                  <p>1. Is there not a God? If there be not
a God, How did we come to be? Thou
wer't not made by chance; And when
thou wer't not, thou couldst not make
thy self. Look upon thy Body, so curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
framed, Whose workmanship could
this be, but of a Wise God? Upon thy
Soul, Whose Image and Superscription
doth it bear? <hi>Give unto Caesar the things
which are Caesar's, and unto God the things
which are God's.</hi> Nay, look upward,
downward, within thee, without thee,
what dost thou see, hear, and feel, but
the Products and Effects of an eternal
Power, Wisdom, and Goodness? Thou
canst not open thine Eyes, but the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
are ready to say to thy Conscience,
Man, there is a God, an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inite eternal
Being, who made us, and all things
else.</p>
                  <p>Now for the second: Hath not this
God revealed himself gracious in Christ?
Nature declareth there is a God; and
Scripture, that there is a Christ. As there
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64994:211"/>
is one God, the first Cause of all, infinitely
powerful, wise, and good; therefore 'tis
but reasonable that he should be served,
and according to his own Will. But we
have faulted in our Duty to our Creator,
and therefore are in dread of his Justice.
Certainly reasonable Creatures have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Souls, and so die not as the Beasts;
therefore there is no true Happiness in
these things wherein Men ordinarily seek
it. Is it not then a blessed discovery, that
God hath brought Light and Immortality
to light by Jesus Christ; that he sent him
into the World to be a Propitiation, and
to satisfy his Justice, and to redeem us
from our guilty Fears? And shall we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
this great Salvation brought to us by
Jesus Christ? or coldly seek after it? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God is willing to be reconciled to Man,
or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>im; God also bearing them witness, both
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64994:211"/>
with Signs and Wonders, and divers Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and Gifts of the Holy Ghost, according
to his own Will?</hi> Heb. 2. 3, 4. Would
Holy Men cheat the World with an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture?
or would God be accessory in
lending his Power to do such marvellous
things? It cannot be.</p>
                  <p>And then for the third: Is not this a
part of the Word of God, which Holy
Men have written to consign it to the use
of the Church in all Ages? 1 <hi>Iohn 2. 45.
This is the Promise which he hath promised
us, Eternal Life.</hi> Is not this God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise?
And will not God be mindful and
regardful of his Word? He was wont to
be tender of it. Psal. 138. 2. <hi>Thou hast
magnified thy Word above all thy Name:</hi>
above all that is named, or famed, or
spoken and believed of God. His Truth
and Trustiness is most conspicuous. In the
New Covenant he hath given his solemn
Oath, as well as his Word, that the Heirs
of Promise might have strong Consolation,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. What is the matter that my belief
of these things is so cold and ineffectual?
If this be God's Promise, and he hath put
in no exception against me, to exclude
me from the benefit of this Promise, What
is the reason why I can no more incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64994:212"/>
my self in the Lord to seek after this
Salvation; but am disturbed so often by
distracting Fears and Cares, and so easily
misled by vain Delights. Thus should we
excite our Faith.</p>
                  <p>But I digress too long.</p>
                  <p>3. The Nature of this Faith, I express
by a Trust and Confidence. There is in
Faith an Assent, which is sufficient when
the Object requireth no more. As there
are some speculative Principles which are
meerly to be believed, as they lead on to
other things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 3. there an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Assent sufficeth. But there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things which are propounded, not
only as true, but good: There, not only
an intellectual Assent is required, but a
practical Assent, or such as is joyned with
Consent and Affiance. As suppose when
Christ promiseth Eternal Life to the seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Christian, or mortified Believer: There
must be not only an assent, or a believing
that this proposal and offer is Christ's, and
that it is true; But there must be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
to chuse it for my Portion and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and then a confidence and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon Christ for it, though it lie
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64994:212"/>
out of sight, and in the mean time I be
exercised with sundry Difficulties and
Temptations. Trust is not a bare Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ's Fidelity, but a dependance
upon his Word. I do believe there is a
God, and that there is a Christ, I do well;
I do believe that this God in Christ, hath
brought Life and Immortality to light, I
do well still, but I must do more; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he hath assured his Disciples and
Followers, That if they continue faithful
with him, they shall have eternal Life:
John 5. 29. <hi>Verily, verily, I say unto you,
He that heareth my Word, and believeth on
him that sent me, hath everlasting Life, and
shall not come into condemnation.</hi> I know
that Christ hath fidelity and sufficiency
enough to make good his Word. This is
well, but I must go farther, that is to say,
<hi>I</hi> must chuse this eternal Life that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to me, for my felicity and portion,
this is Consent; and <hi>I</hi> must continue with
patience in well-doing, depending upon
his faithful Word whilst <hi>I</hi> am in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of it, this is Trust or Confidence. As
this World is Vanity, and hath nothing in
it worthy to be compared with the Hopes
which Christ hath given me of a better
Life, so <hi>I</hi> chuse it for my Happiness. But
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64994:213"/>
as <hi>I</hi> judg him faithful that hath promised,
and depend upon him that he will make
good his Word, though this Happiness be
future, and lieth in another, an unseen,
an unknown World, to which there is
no coming but by Faith, this is the Trust,
and by that Name it is often expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in Scripture. 'Tis nothing else but a
sure and comfortable dependance upon
God through Jesus Christ, in the way of
well-doing for the Gift of eternal Life.
Psalm. 112. 7. <hi>His Heart is fixed, trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Lord.</hi> So, <hi>Isa. 26. 3. Thou
keepest him in perfect peace, whose mind is
stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee.</hi>
The New Testament also useth this term,
2 Cor. 3. 4. <hi>Such trust have we through
Christ to Godward.</hi> And, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 10.
For therefore we both labour, and suffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
because we trust in the living God.</hi>
Well then, this Trust is more than an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
or bare Perswasion of the mind that
the Promises are true; yea, 'tis more than
a motion of the Will towards them as
good and satisfying; for it noteth a quiet
repose of the Heart, on the fidelity and
mercy of God in Christ, that he will
give this Blessedness, if we do in the first
place seek after it. The more we cherish
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64994:213"/>
this Confidence, the more sure we are of
our Interest, both in Christ and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise;
Heb. 3. 6. <hi>Whose House we are, if we
hold fast our Confidence, and rejoicing of
Hope firm unto the end.</hi> And, <hi>vers.</hi> 14.
<hi>We are made partakers of Christ, if we hold
the beginning of our Confidence stedfast unto
the end.</hi> And, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 35. a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Text, <hi>Cast not away your Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which hath great recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
In all which places, Confidence
noteth our resolute ingaging in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Life, because we depend upon
Christ's Rewards in another World. In
our passage to Heaven, we meet with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
Temptations, we are assaulted both
on the right hand, and on the left, with
the terrors of sense, which are a discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to us; and the delights of
sense, which are a snare to us. Confidence
or Trust, fortifieth us against both these
Temptations, the Difficulties, Dangers,
and Sufferings, which we meet with in
our passage to Heaven, yea tho it should
be death it self: for Faith seeth the end
glorious, and that the Salvation of our
Souls is sure and near, if we continue
faithful with Christ. On the other side,
Affiance or Trust draweth the Heart to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64994:214"/>
better things, and we can easily want or
miss the Contentments of the Flesh, the
pomp, and ease, and pleasure of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Life, because our Hearts are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and we have more excellent things
in view and pursuit. This breedeth a
weanedness from the Baits of the Flesh,
and a rejection and contempt of what
would take us off from the pursuit of
eternal Life: 1 Cor. 9. 26, 27. <hi>I run not
as one that is uncertain.</hi> As if he had said,
<hi>I</hi> am confident, therefore <hi>I</hi> am morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to the World.</p>
                  <p>4. The immediate Fruit and Effect of
it, is a forsaking all other Hopes and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
for Christ's sake, and for the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
which he offereth. That forsaking
all belongeth to this Affiance and Trust, is
plain, because <hi>I</hi> can neither trust God,
nor be true to him, till <hi>I</hi> can venture all
my Happiness upon this security. And if
God calleth me to it, actually forsake all
upon these Hopes. This will appear to
you by these Arguments.</p>
                  <p>1. By the Doctrinal Descriptions of the
Gospel-Faith. Our Lord hath told us,
that the Kingdom of Heaven is like a
Merchant-man, <hi>Matth. 13. 45, 46. The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64994:214"/>
Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-man,
seeking goodly Pearls; who
when he had found one Pearl of great price,
went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</hi>
And certainly he knew the Nature of that
Faith better than we do. Many cheapen
the Pearl of Price, but they do not go
through with the Bargain, because they
do not fell all to purchase it. No, you
must have such a sense of the Excellency
and truth of Salvation by Christ, that you
must chuse it, and let go all that is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with this Choice and Trust. You
must be resolved to let go all your sinful
Pleasures, Profit, and Reputation, and
your Life it self, rather than forfeit these
Hopes. So, <hi>Luke 14. 26. If any Man
come unto me, and hate not Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and Wife, and Children, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and Sisters, yea, and his own Life,
he cannot be my Disciple.</hi> So, <hi>Vers.</hi> 33.
<hi>Whosoever he be, that forsaketh not all that
he hath, cannot be my Disciple.</hi> After such
express declararions of the Will of Christ,
why should we think of going to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
at a cheaper rate, and that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
will be modelled, and brought down
to our Humours? Christ's Service will
bring Trouble with it. All that is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64994:215"/>
in the World, must be renounced, or
else we shall not be able to hold out. The
same is inferred out of the Doctrine of
Self-denial, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 24. 'Tis the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
Fruit, yea, the principal Act of
our Trust; for if God be trusted, as our
F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>licity, he must be loved above all, and
all things must give way to God. The
same is inferred out of the Baptismal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
which is a renouncing the Devil,
the World, and the Flesh, and a giving
up our selves to Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, as our God. This Renouncing,
implieth a venturing of all, that we may
obtain this Blessedness, or eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>2. By all the extraordinary Calls, and
Trials, that are propounded as a Pattern
to us. Faith was ever a venturing all, and
a forsaking all, upon the belief of God's
Veracity. Let us see <hi>Noah</hi>'s Faith; <hi>Heb.
11. 7. By Faith</hi> Noah <hi>being warned of God,
concerning things not seen as yet, prepared
an Ark for the saving of his House.</hi> That
warning that God gave him of the Flood,
was extraordinary, but they were <hi>of
things not seen as yet;</hi> whilst these things
were in the mind of God, no Man or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
could know them; and after God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
them, there was nothing but his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64994:215"/>
bare word for it. But <hi>Noah</hi> believed;
And what then? At God's prescription,
with vast expence, he prepareth an Ark,
and that was selling all. He was of a vast
Estate, or else he could not have prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
such a Fabrick, so many Years in
building, and so furnished; but this was
the prescribed means to save his Houshold.
In the next place, let us consider <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Trial, who was the <hi>Father of the
Faithful.</hi> His first trial was, <hi>Heb. 11. 8.
By Faith</hi> Abraham <hi>when we was called to
go out to a place, which he should afterwards
receive for an Inheritance, obeyed, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whither he went.</hi> Here was trusting,
and venturing all upon God's Call. He
forsook his Kindred, and Father's House,
and All, to seek an Abode he knew not
where. Therefore we must forsake the
World, and all things therein, yea, Life it
self, having our Thoughts and Affections
fixed on Heaven. There must be a total
resignation of Heart and Will to God.
We owe God blind Obedience. To for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ke
our Country, Kindred, Friends, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
is a sore Trial; yet this was
done by him, and must be done by all
that will be saved; We must deny our
selves, take up our Cross, and forsake
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64994:216"/>
Father and Mother, Wife and Children,
all Relations. All this he did, for a Land
which he neither knew where it was, nor
the way to it. Our God hath told us, He
will bring us into the Heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi>
His second trial you have recorded, <hi>Vers.</hi>
17. <hi>By Faith</hi> Abraham <hi>when he was tried,
offered up</hi> Isaac; <hi>and he that received the
Promises, offered up his only Son.</hi> God
would try <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he might be an
Example of Faith to all future Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
whether <hi>Abraham</hi> loved God, or his
Son <hi>Isaac</hi> more. But he did not shrink
upon Trial; he offered him up, that is, in
his Heart he had parted with him, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him wholly unto God, and made all
ready for the Offering, being assured of
God's fidelity; even <hi>Isaac,</hi> upon whom
the Promises were setled, must be offered;
Children, dear Children, every thing must
be given up to God. In the next place,
Consider we the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Red Sea;
Heb. 11. 29. <hi>By Faith they passed through
the Red Sea, as by dry Land.</hi> God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<hi>Moses,</hi> when in straits, to strike
the Sea with his Rod, and <hi>Israel</hi> to pass for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and expect the Salvation of God,
promising to deliver them. They did so,
and the Sea was divided, and the Waters
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64994:216"/>
stood like Walls and Mountains, as if
they had been congealed and turned to
Ice; and the bottom, which never saw
Sun before, is made like firm Ground,
without Mud and Quick-sands. Thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
will God be trusted by his People,
and they must put their All into his hands.
If God will have it so, Faith must find a
way through the great Deep. No Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
so great that we must decline. Come
we now to the New Testament; Christ's
trial of the young Man: <hi>Iesus said unto
him, Go thy way, sell all that thou hast, and
give to the Poor, and thou shalt have Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in Heaven,</hi> Mark 10. 21. But he
could not venture on Christ's Command,
and went away sad. The Promise of
Eternal Life, and Treasure in Heaven,
could not part the young Man and his
great Estate, and therefore he continued
uncapable of eternal Bliss. This young
Man is set forth in the Gospel as a warning
to others. So in <hi>Peter</hi>'s Trial, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.
29, 30. If Christ bid <hi>Peter</hi> come to him
upon the Waters, <hi>Peter</hi> must come though
the storm continueth, and he be ready to
sink at every step.</p>
                  <p>3. By all the Instances of Faith, in the
ordinary and common case of Salvation.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64994:217"/>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> had Faith, therefore he forsook all
Honours, Pleasures, and Treasures, for he
trusted God, and waited for the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of Reward, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 24, 25, 26.
'Tis endless in instancing in all: Take
these, <hi>Heb. 10. 34. Ye took joyfully the
spoiling of your Goods, knowing in your
selves, that ye have a better and more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during

these things, but they valued Christ as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

yet if they lost not Christ, they were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
enough; for then they still kept the
Title to the enduring Substance. Thus
you see what is Faith; <hi>Such a trusting in
God for eternal Life, as maketh us willing
to forsake all, rather than be unfaithful to
Christ.</hi> Others may delude you, inchant
your Souls asleep with fine strains of ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood
and abused Grace. But if you
would not be deceived, take the Faith
and Christianity of Christ's Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
which is the Faith now described.
Are we in the place of God, that we can
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64994:217"/>
make Heaven narrower or broader for
you? Surely 'tis Grace, rich Grace that
God will pardon us, and call us to eternal
Life by Jesus Christ. Now if you will
have it, you must believe to the Salvation
of the Soul, so believe, as to quit all other
things to obtain it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Is for Examination. Let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
our Spiritual Condition, whether
it be good or bad; whether our Faith be
sincere, our Profession real; whether we
tend to Perdition, or to Salvation; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we believe to the saving of the Soul;
that is, if we care not what we lose, so
we may obtain the heavenly Inheritance.
Have you such a trust, as that you can
venture the loss of something which is
dear to you for this Trust; yea, not only
something, but all things? Certainly
we have not a true belief of the promise
of eternal Life, if we can venture no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon it, hazard nothing for it. Now
we venture things upon the account of
God's Promise, four ways.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. In a way of Mortification.</item>
                     <item>2. In a way of Self-denial.</item>
                     <item>3. In a way of Charity.</item>
                     <item>4. In a way of submission to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:64994:218"/>1. In a way of Mortification. Deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our selves the sinful Pleasures of the
Senses. Our Sins were never worth the
keeping; these must always be parted with,
other things but at times; therefore I
can venture but little upon the security of
eternal Life, if I cannot deny my fleshly
and worldly Lusts, and a little vain Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
for that fulness of Joy which is at
God's right hand for evermore. I have
God's Word for it, that if I mortify the
Deeds of the Body, I shall live, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
13. 'Tis yet hard to abjure accustomed
Delights; and to Hearts pleasantly set,
the strictness of an holy Life seemeth grim
and severe; but a Believer that hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
into Eternity, knoweth that 'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to deny the Flesh, than to displease
God; To take a little pains in rectifying
our disordered Hearts, and distempered
Souls, than to endure pains for evermore.
And that a little momentany Delight is
bought too dear, if it be bought with the
loss of eternal Joys. No, let me lose my
Lusts, rather than lose my Soul, saith he.
Every Man's Heart cleaveth to those things
which he judgeth best; and the more it
cleaveth to better things, the more 'tis
withdrawn from other things. Therefore
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64994:218"/>
Faith shewing us the truth and worth of
heavenly Things, and taking God's Word
for its security; it mastereth our Desires
and carnal Affections. 'Tis <hi>the Stranger
and Pilgrim</hi> (whose Mind is perswaded
of things to come, and whose Heart is set
upon them) <hi>that abstaineth from fleshly
Lusts,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 11. Upon the assurance
of God's Word, he is taking his journey
into another World: Tho the Flesh will
rebel, yet he counterballanceth the Good
and Evil which the Flesh proposeth; with
the Good and Evil of the other World,
which the Word of God proposeth; and
so learneth more and more to contemn the
pleasures of Sin, and curb his unruly Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
<hi>Mortify your Members upon Earth,
for your Life is hid with Christ in God,</hi> Col.
3. 3, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>5. And they that look for a Life
of Glory hereafter, will chuse a Life of
Purity here upon Earth. 'Tis the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
findeth such an impotency in resisting
present Temptations; he hath not any sense,
or not a deep sense of the World to come.</p>
                  <p>2. In a way of Self-denial. What can
you venture and forgo that way upon the
security of God's Promise? Mortification
concerneth our Lusts, and Self-denial our
Interests. What Interest can you venture
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64994:219"/>
upon the warrant of the Promise? Christ
saith, <hi>He that denieth me before Men, I will
deny him before my Father in Heaven,</hi> Luke
12. 9. And again, <hi>Whosoever shall save
his Life, shall lose it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 24. And
once more, <hi>vers. 26. Whosoever shall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
of me and my words, of him shall
the Son of Man be ashamed, when he cometh
in his Glory.</hi> Now urge the Soul with
the Promises; Am I willing to hazard my
temporal Conveniencies for the enduring
Substance? to incur shame and blame
with Men, that I may be faithful with
God, and own his Interest in the World?
and do I so when it actually cometh to a
trial? The Heart is deceitful, and a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in Conceit and Imagination, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to a Temptation in Act and Deed:
Therefore when your Resolutions are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted
by Temptations of any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
strength, Do you acquit your self
with good fidelity? Can you trust God,
when he trieth your Trust in some neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Point of Confession, which may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you to some loss, shame, and hazard
in the World?</p>
                  <p>3. In a way of Charity, and doing
good with your Estates. That Religion
is worth nothing that costs nothing; and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64994:219"/>
when all is laid out upon Pomp and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and worldly Ends, as the advancing
of your Families and Relations; and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or nothing for God, upon the security
of his Promise, or only so much as the
Flesh can spare, to hide your self-pleasing
and self-seeking in other things. Can you
practise upon that Promise, and try your
Faith; Luke 12. 33. <hi>Sell that you have,
and give Alms; provide your selves Bags
that wax not old, a Treasure in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
that faileth not.</hi> What have you
ventured in this kind? Do you believe,
that <hi>he that giveth to the Poor, lendeth to
the Lord?</hi> and that he will be your Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master?
Do you look upon no Estate so
sure, as that which is trusted in Christ's
Hands? and are you content to be at some
considerable cost for Eternal Life? Most
Men love a cheap Gospel, and the Flesh
ingrosseth all. Faith gets little from them
to be laid out for God. Do not these
Men run a fearful hazard? And while
they are so over-careful to preserve their
Estates to themselves and Families, Do
they believe to the saving of their Souls?
Or if they do not preserve their Estates,
but waste them, and are at great costs for
their Lusts, they do nothing considerably,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64994:220"/>
or proportionably for God; this is saving
to the Flesh, and they shall of the Flesh
reap Corruption.</p>
                  <p>4. In a way of submission to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Whether you will or no, you are
at God's disposal, and cannot shift your
selves out of his Hands, either here, or
hereafter: But yet 'tis a part of your Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
voluntarily to surrender your selves, to
be disposed of, and ordered by God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his pleasure, to be content to
be, what he will have you to be, and to
do what he will have you to do and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
is included in selling all. You must
submit to be at God's finding, which is
that poverty of Spirit spoken of, <hi>Mat.
5. 3. Blessed are the poor in Spirit.</hi> Such
whose Minds and Spirits are subdued, and
brought under Obedience to God; you
must be content to injoy what God will
have you to injoy, and to want what he
will have you want, and to lose what he
will have you lose. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 26, 27.
and <hi>Iob 1. 21. The Lord gave, and the
Lord hath taken away, blessed be the Name
of the Lord.</hi> Many seem to resign all,
Goods, Life, and All, to the Will of God.
But 'tis because they secretly think in their
Hearts, that God will never put them to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64994:220"/>
the trial, or take from them what they
resign to him; but they are not prepared
for a submission to all Events. Like those
that make large Promises to others, when
they think they will not take them at
their words. So their Hearts secretly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
and reserve much of that they resign
to God. But this is false-dealing, and is
shewn in part, in murmuring when God
taketh any thing from us.</p>

                     </gap> must be
interpreted: If you consider it as to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation,
and actual Possession, so we
receive it at Death, when our Self-denying
Obedience is ended: And for the present
we are said to receive it, because we are
sure to receive it at the close of our days.
We believe now that we shall at length
have it, and therefore rejoice with Joy
unspeakable and full of Glory. 2. If you
consider it with respect to Inchoation, or
begun Possession. We have an undoubted
Right now, and some beginnings of it in
the Consolations of the Spirit. Now we
receive it in the Promises, we receive it in
the first Fruits, which are some forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Beams of the day-light of eternal
Glory.</p>
                  <p>2. The Grace which qualifieth, and
giveth us a Title to this Benefit, is <hi>Faith.</hi>
The word <hi>Faith</hi> is taken in Scripture
sometimes for <hi>fides quae creditur,</hi> sometimes
for <hi>fides quâ creditur,</hi> for the Doctrine, or
Grace of Faith. The first Acceptation
will make a good sense here, namely, that

pursute after eternal Salvation: 'Tis

But I take it rather for the Grace. This

Souls is the prime Benefit which Faith is
not only allowed, but required to aim
at. A Believer levelleth and directeth all
his Actions to this end, that at length he
may obtain eternal Life. Sometimes 'tis

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> That the End and Reward of
Faith, is the Salvation of our Souls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:64994:222"/>I shall open the Point, by explicating
three Questions.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. What is this Salvation of our Souls?</item>
                     <item>2. What Right the Believer hath to it?</item>
                     <item>3. What is that saving-Faith which
giveth us a Title to it? The last is
most important.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. What is the Salvation of the Soul?
'Tis not meant of temporal Deliverance,
or an escape from Danger, as some would
affix that sense upon it, but of eternal
Life, or our happy Estate in Heaven:
This belongeth to our whole Man, the
Body as well as the Soul; but the Soul is
the chief part of Man, and that which is
first glorified. When Men come first into
the World, first the Body is framed, and
then the Soul cometh after: As we see in
the Creation of <hi>Adam,</hi> first his Body was
organized, and then God breathed into
him the Spirit of Life. And we see it in
common Generation, when the Body is
first framed in the Womb, then 'tis quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by a living Soul. This lower Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the World is properly the place of
Bodies, therefore Reason requires that the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64994:223"/>
Body, which is a Citizen of the World,
should first be framed, that it may be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
for the Soul, which is a stranger,
and cometh from the Region of Spirits
that is above. But when we must remove
into these heavenly Habitations, then 'tis
quite otherwise; for then the Soul as a
Native of that place, is presently admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but the Body as a stranger, is forced
to recide in the Grave till the Day of
Judgment; and then for the sake of the
Soul, our Bodies also are admitted into
Heaven: This is the ordinary Law for all
private Persons. Christ indeed, who is
the Head of the Church, and the Prince
of this World, and that which is to come,
his Body, as well as his humane Spirit, was
made a Denizon of Heaven as soon as he
ascended: He entred into Heaven, not as
a private Citizen, but as King and Lord
of the Heavenly Jerusalem; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
carried both Body and Soul along
with him. But as to us, first the Soul go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
there, as into his ancient Seat, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Habitation, and afterwards the Body
followeth.</p>
                  <p>Well then, 1. at Death our Souls go to
Christ, and enter into a state of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
Phil. 1. 23. <hi>I desire to be dissolved,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64994:223"/>
and to be with Christ.</hi> The Soul is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated
after Death, nor doth it sleep
till the Resurrection, nor is it detained
by the way from immediate passing into
Glory: but if it be the Soul of a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
as soon as it is loosed from the Body,
it is with Christ; Luke 23. 43. <hi>Verily I
say unto thee, to day shalt thou be with me in
Paradise.</hi> He asked to be remembred
when Christ came into his Kingdom; and
Christ assureth him of a reception there
that day as soon as he should expire.</p>
                  <p>2. In due time the Body is raised and
united to the Soul; and then <hi>Christ will be
glorified in his Saints, and admired in all
them that believe,</hi> 2 Thess. 1. 10. Such
glory and honour will be put upon those
who are but newly crept out of Dust and
Rottenness; the Saints themselves, and all
the Spectators, shall wonder at it.</p>
                  <p>3. There is another Period in this Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness;
Our everlasting habitation in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
near unto the Throne of God, and
in the presence of his Glory; John 14.
2. <hi>In my Father's House are many Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi>
There we shall also have the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Angels, and blessed Spirits, and
make up one Society with them; <hi>Heb. 12.
23. To the general Assembly and Church of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64994:224"/>
the first Born, which are written in Heaven,
and to God the Iudg of all, and to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of just Men made perfect.</hi> This is the
sum of the Salvation which we expect,
or our everlasting Happiness with God in
Heaven.</p>
                  <p>2. What is the Right of Believers, or
the Interest of Faith in this great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit?</p>
                  <p>I Anser;</p>
                  <p>1. It doth not merit this Reward; for
it is not a Reward of due Debt, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of any intrinsick Righteousness in us,
or any thing that we can do and suffer;
but of mere Grace and Favour; <hi>Ephes. 2.
8. For by Grace ye are saved through Faith,
and that not of your selves, it is the Gift of
God.</hi> The Apostle is very tender of the
Honour of Grace, and the Interest of
Grace in our Salvation. From the first
step to the last period, all is of Grace, and
this Glory of his free Grace, God must
not be robbed of, neither in whole nor
in part. We have all from his Elective
Love, we have all from the Merit and
Righteousness of Christ, and all from the
almighty Operation of the sanctifying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
Faith it self is a Gift and Fruit of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64994:224"/>
God's Grace in us. <hi>To you 'tis given to
believe,</hi> Phil. 1. 29. Therefore surely 'tis
God's free Grace, Favour, and Good-will,
which doth freely bestow that Salvation
on the Elect, which Christ by his Merit
hath purchased; and that very Faith by
which we apply and make out our actual
Claim and Title, is wrought in us by the
Spirit; so that there is nothing in the
Persons to whom all this is given, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
God to confer so great Benefit on
us.</p>
                  <p>2. Tho it be an undeserved Favour,
upon which our Works have no merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Influence, yet Believers have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Right by the Grant and Promise
of God, wherein they may comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and which they may plead before
God. John 3. 16. <hi>God so loved the World,
that he gave his only begotten Son, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
believeth in him, should not perish, but
have Life Everlastingly.</hi> And, <hi>Iohn 5. 24.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that
heareth my words, and believeth in him that
sent me, hath everlasting Life, and shall not
come into condemnation, but is passed from
Death to Life.</hi> And in many places, where
the Believer is qualified as the Heir of
Glory. He that entertaineth Christ's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64994:225"/>
and receiveth and owneth him as
the True Messiah and Saviour of the
World, and dependeth upon him, and
obeyeth him, this Man hath a full right
and new Covenant-Title to eternal
Life.</p>
                  <p>3. He hath not only a new Covenant-Right,
but a begun Possession. We have
some small Beginnings, Earnests, and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastes
of it in this; partly in the Graces,
partly in the Comforts of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>(1.) In the Graces of the Holy Spirit.
For Salvation is begun in our new Birth,
<hi>Titus</hi> 3. 5. And therefore Sanctifying Grace
is called <hi>Immortal,</hi> or <hi>incorruptible Seed,</hi>
1 Pet. 1. 23. There is an eternal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
put into them, which carrieth them
to eternal Ends. The Life is begun in all
that shall be saved, and it is still working
towards its final Perfection. The Apostle
telleth us, That <hi>he that hateth his Brother,
hath not eternal Life abiding in him,</hi> 1 Joh.
3. 15. Whereby he implieth, That he that
loveth his Brother, or hath any saving
Grace, he hath eternal Life begun in
him.</p>
                  <p>(2.) As to Comforts, so they have some
foretastes of that sweetness which is in
Heaven, by the Life and Exercise of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64994:225"/>
Faith, which is followed with Peace and
Joy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13. Or in their approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to God in the Word and Prayer,
where Cod most familiarly manifests him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto his People, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. or upon
some apprehensions of his favour, or the
exercise of Hope and Love, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8.
By these or the like ways, the Spirit of
God giveth us the foretaste. Surely such
an Author, such an Object, must needs
put ravishing and heavenly Joy into the
Heart of a Believer.</p>
                  <p>4. They are also made meet to partake
of the heavenly Inheritance, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12.
There is <hi>Ius Haereditarium,</hi> and <hi>Ius Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinale.</hi>
The difference is, as between
an Heir grown, and in his nonage, when
a Child in the Cradle. As their Natures
are more renewed and purified, and their
Souls weaned from the delights of sense,
they are changed into the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>3. What is that saving-Faith which
giveth us a title to it? This deserveth to
be cleared, that we may not deceive our
selves with a false claim.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:64994:226"/>Saving-Faith is such a believing in Christ,
for reconciliation with God, and the
everlasting Fruition of him in Glory;
as maketh us to forsake all things in this
World, and give up our selves to the
conduct of the Word and Spirit for the
obtaining of it.</p>
                  <p>1. The general Nature of it I express
by believing. There is in it, <hi>Assent, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi>
and <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>iance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Assent.</hi> That leadeth on the rest,
when we believe the Truth of God's
Word, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 14, 15. especially those
practical Truths which do most nearly
concern our recovery to God; as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Man's Sin and Misery, that we
have broken his Laws, and are obnoxious
to his Justice, and have deserved punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for our Sins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Christ, his Person and Office, that
he is the Son of God, and that he came
from God, to bring home Sinners to God,
and what he hath done to reconcile us to
him; 1 Pet. 3. 18. <hi>For Christ also hath
once suffered for our Sins, the Iust for the
Vnjust; (that he might bring us to God)
being put to death in the Flesh, but quickned
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64994:226"/>
by the Spirit.</hi> And also concerning your
Duty and Happiness, the End and the
Way: There is no other End and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
but God, no other Way but the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
and the Means appointed by him,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 6. Now these and such-like
Truths must be believed, that is, in the
sense we are now upon, assented unto as
faithful Sayings, and worthy of all accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and regard.</p>
                  <p>2. There is a <hi>Consent</hi> in Faith, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you apply it to the Word, or Christ.
If Christ be propounded as the Object of
it, 'tis called a receiving, <hi>Iohn 1. 12. But
as many as received him, to them gave he
power to become the Sons of God:</hi> So the
word, <hi>Acts 2. 41. They gladly received
his Word;</hi> that is, embraced the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Covenant,
being really affected with
what he had spoken, concerning their Sin,
and their Duty. Without this, the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
is but Intellectual and Speculative,
not Practical. An Opinion, not an Act,
or Motion of the new Nature: I am to
receive the Christ offered, to embrace
the Covenant propounded. To accept of
the Blessings offered for my Happiness,
and to resolve upon the Duties required
as my Work. This is Consent, or an
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64994:227"/>
hearty accepting of Christ, or the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace offered to us in his Name.</p>
                  <p>3. There is Affiance, Trust, Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
or Confidence; which is a quiet
repose of Heart in the Mercy of God, or
Fidelity of Christ, that he will give me
Pardon and Life, if I seek after it in the
way that he hath appointed. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in upon the former; for when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to seek my happiness in God, through
Christ, I depend upon the security of his
Word, that so doing I shall obtain it. This
intitleth us to the Reward; <hi>Heb. 3. 6.
Whose House we are if we hold fast the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
and rejoicing of Hope firm unto the
End.</hi> And, <hi>Vers. 14. For we are made
partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning
of our Confidence stedfast unto the End.</hi>
And, <hi>Heb. 10. 35. Cast not away your
Confidence, which hath great recompence of
Reward.</hi> The Happiness which Christ
promiseth us, is spiritual; and for the
most part future, an lieth in an unseen and
unknown World; but whilst we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in the pursuit of it, we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aithful Word: That must
be security enough to us, to engage us to
continue with patience in the midst of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
Temptations, till we obtain what
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64994:227"/>
he offereth to us. These three must be
often renewed; <hi>Assent, Consent,</hi> and <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. 'Tis a believing in Christ. I make
Christ the special Object of this Belief,
not as exclusive of the Father, or the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but because of the peculiar reference
which this Grace hath to the Mediator in
this New and Gospel-Dispensation, which
was appointed for the Remedy of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsed
estate of Mankind. So, <hi>Acts 20.
21. Repentance towards God, and Faith in
our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> He speaks of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
as respecting God, and Faith as
respecting Christ. These are the two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
Graces; Repentance is necessary,
because of the Duty we owe to our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and supream Lord; and Faith respects
our Redeemer, who principally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
our recovery to God. Christ is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in, in order to the Salvation of our
Souls.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Because he purchased and procured
this Salvation for us, as Mediator of the
New Testament. Heb.</hi> 9. 5. He is the
Mediator of the New Testament, that by
means of Death for the Redemption of the
Transgressions that were under the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64994:228"/>
they which are called, might receive
the Promise of the eternal Inheritance. <hi>By
the intervention of his Death, Sins are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated,
that penitent Believers might have
everlasting Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Because 'tis by him promised, or in
his Name. 1 John 2. 25. <hi>This is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
which he hath promised us, even eternal
Life.</hi> Christ's great Business, as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
is to discover with certainty and
clearness, such a blessed Estate, that it
may be commodious for our acceptance,
laid at our doors if we will take it, well
and good: He is <hi>Amen,</hi> the faithful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 14. who came with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from Heaven, to assure the World
of it: and to confirm his Message, he
wrought Miracles, died, and rose again,
and entred into that Happiness which he
spake of, that our Faith and Hope might
be in God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. Guilty Man is
fallen under the Power and Fear of
Death, and strangely haunted with Doubts
about the other World. Now he that
came to save us and heal us, did himself
in our Nature rise from the Dead, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
into Heaven, that he might give a
visible demonstration, both of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and Life to come, which he hath
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64994:228"/>
promised to us. And when he sent abroad
Messengers in his Name, to assure the
World of it, their Testimony was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with divers Signs, and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and Gifts of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Heb.</hi>
2. 3, 4. that the stupid World might be
alarum'd to regard the offer, and by this
Evidence be assured of the Truth of it;
therefore still 'tis a believing in Christ.</p>
                  <p>3. Because as King he doth administer
and dispense the Blessings of the New
Covenant; and among them, as the Chief
and Principal, this Salvation unto all
those who are qualified: And therefore
'tis said, <hi>Heb. 5. 9. Being made perfect
through Sufferings, he is become the Author
of eternal Salvation to all that obey him.</hi>
Every Effect must have some Cause; and
this noble and glorious Effect of eternal
Salvation, could have no other Cause but
Christ: and he as perfected and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated,
is the Author and efficient Cause
of it: for as King, he sendeth down the
Holy Ghost to reveal the Gospel, and
work Faith in the Hearts of Men, to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify
them for Pardon and Salvation; and
all those that sue for Pardon and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in his Name, by the Plea of his Blood
before the Throne of God, and promise
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64994:229"/>
obedience to his Laws and Institutes, he
actually bestoweth Pardon, and eternal
Salvation upon them. There be many
other ministerial, and adjutant Causes,
which conduce to this effect; But he is
the Principal; and the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which
signifieth a <hi>Cause</hi> in general, is fitly by our
Translation termed, the <hi>Author</hi> of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Salvation: So that still you see a new
Reason why saving-Faith should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to be a believing in Christ.</p>
                  <p>3. The prime Benefits which Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth,
I make to be two. Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with God, and the everlasting Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of him in Glory.</p>
                  <p>1. Reconciliation is necessarily eyed
and regarded by the guilty Soul.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Because there hath been a breach,
by which we have lost God's Favour and
Happiness. We have to do with a God
whose Nature ingageth him to hate Sin,
and whose Justice ingageth him to Punish
it: And before we can be induced to treat
with him, such a Reconciliation is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for all Mankind, as that he should be
willing to deal with them upon the term
of a New Covenant, wherein Pardon
and Life might be offered to penitent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64994:229"/>
This Reconciliation is spoken of,
2 Cor. 5. 19. <hi>God was in Christ reconciling
the World unto himself, not imputing their
Trespasses; and hath committed unto us the
Word of Reconciliation;</hi> that is, upon the
sufficiency of Christ's Sacrifice, Ransom,
and Satisfaction; there was so much done
towards an actual Reconciliation with
God, that he offered a conditional Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to as many as were willing to enter
into his Peace. He provided a sufficient
Remedy for the Pardon of Sin, if Men
would as heartily accept of it, as it was
freely given them. And the Office of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
was appointed, to beseech Men
so to do. And unless this had been done,
a guilty Soul could never be brought to
love an holy, sin-hating God, ingaged by
Justice to damn the Sinner: But it must
be a loving reconciled God that is willing
to forgive, that can be propounded as an
Object of Faith and Love, or as an amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
God to us. Psalm. 130. 4. <hi>There is
forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be
feared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. Reconciliation is necessarily eyed by
the penitent Believer, because this Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
and Recovery by Christ, consists
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64994:230"/>
both in the Pardon of Sin, and the Gift
of the Sanctifying Spirit.</p>
                  <p>1. One branch of the actual restitution
of God's Favour to us, is the Pardon of
Sins; without which we are not capable
of Life and Happiness, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 7. The
possible conditional-Reconciliation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in the offer of Pardon, and the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Reconciliation, in the actual pardon
and forgiveness of our Transgressions;
and then the Man beginneth to be in a
blessed Estate, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>2. The other Branch is the Gift of the
Sanctifying Spirit, which is the great Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
and Pledg of his Love; then is
our Pardon executed, or actually applied
to us: And we receive the Attonement,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 11. And, 2 <hi>Cor 5. 8. All things
are of God, who hath reconciled us to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by Iesus C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rist;</hi> that is, all thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gs
which belong to the New Creature, <hi>vers.</hi>
17. And that's the Reason why God is
said to sanctify as a God of Peace; that
is, as reconciled to us in Christ; see
1 <hi>Thess. 5. 23. And the very God of Peace
sanctify you wholly:</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 20, 21.
<hi>Now the God of Peace, that brought again
from the Dead our Lord Iesus, that great
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64994:230"/>
Shepherd of the Sheep, through the Blood
of the Everlasting Covenant, make you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in every good Work, to do his Will,</hi> &amp;c.
And in all God's internal Government
with the Saints, he sheweth his pleasure
or displeasure with the Saints, by giving,
or withholding and withdrawing the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
as it were easy to prove to you.
Well then, you see the Reasons why in
believing in Christ, we reflect the Eye of
our Faith on Reconciliation, as the prime
initial Benefit.</p>
                  <p>2. The next great consummating Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
is, the everlasting Fruition of God in
Glory: For Christ's Office is to recover
us to God, and bring us to God, which
is never fully and compleatly done till we
come to Heaven. Therefore the saving
of the Soul is the prime Benefit offered to
us by Jesus Christ, to which all other tend.
As Justification, and Sanctification, and by
which all our Pains and Losses for Christ
are recompenced, and from which we
fetch our comfort all along the course of
our Pilgrimage, and upon the Hopes of
which the Life of Grace is carried on, and
the Temptations of sense are defeated. So
that this is the main Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssing which Faith

aimeth at; see the Scriptures, 1 <hi>Tim. 1.
16. For a Pattern to them who should here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
believe on him to everlasting Life.</hi>
Wherefore do Men believe in Christ, but
for this end, that they may obtain ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Life? Wherefore were the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
written? John 20. 31. <hi>These things
are written, that ye might believe that Iesus
is the Christ, the Son of God; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
ye might have Life through his Name.</hi>
The Scriptures are written, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> we might

                     </gap>ernel and
Marrow of them; and the chief Benefit
we have by him, is Life, or the Salvation
of our Souls; and therefore well may it
be called in the Text, <hi>The End of our
Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. In the next place, I add the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Acts and Effects of it:
<list>
                        <item>1. Such as maketh us to forsake all
things in this World.</item>
                        <item>And, 2. give up our selves to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the Word and Spirit, for the
obtaining this Happiness.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. To forsake all things in this World.
As soon as we address our selves seriously
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64994:231"/>
to believe, we turn our backs upon them,
namely, upon the Pleasures, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
and Profits of this World. We
forsake them in Vow and Resolution,
when we are converted and begin to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
for Conversion is a turning from
the Creature to God. As soon as we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
believe, and hope for the Fruition of
God in Glory, as purchased and promised
by Christ, our hearts are weaned and
withdrawn from the false Happiness, not
perfectly, but yet sincerely; and we actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
renounce and forsake them at the call
of God's Providence, when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
with our fidelity to Christ, and
the hopes of that Happiness which his
Promises offer to us. Now that our Faith
must be expressed by forsaking all, yea,
that it is essential to Faith; and nothing
else is saving-Faith but this, as appeareth,</p>
                  <p>1. By the Doctrinal Descriptions of it
in the Gospel, (which I shall describe to
you according to my usual method); our
Lord hath told us, <hi>That the Kingd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he had found one Pearl of great Price, he
went and sold all that he had and bought it.</hi>
And surely he knew the Nature of Faith
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64994:232"/>
better than we do. Many cheapen the

                     </gap>. Faith implieth such a

by Christ, that you must chuse it,
and let go all which is inconsistent with
this Choice and Trust. All your sinful
Pleasures Profit, Reputation, and Life
it self, rather than forfeit these Hopes:

Declarations of the Will of Christ,
why should we think of going to Heaven
at a ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>per rate? Christ must be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
above all that is nearest or dearest, or
else he will not be for our turn, nor we
for his. The same is inferred out of the
Doctrine of Self-denial; Mat. 16. 24. <hi>If
any Man will come after me, let him deny
himself, and take up his Cross and follow me.</hi>
For Self-denial hath a greater Relation to
Faith, and is nearer of kin to Faith than
the World imagineth, 'tis the immediate
Fruit of our Trust. If God be trusted
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64994:232"/>
as our supream Felicity, he must be loved
above all things, and all things must give
way to God. If Christ be trusted as the
way to the Father, all things must be
counted dung and loss, that we may gain
Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. The same is inferred
out of the Baptismal Covenant, which is
a renouncing the Devil, the World, and
the Flesh, and a chusing Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost for our God; if there be a
chusing, there must be a renouncing. The
Devil by the World, tempts our Flesh
from the Christian Hope; therefore Idols
must be renounced, before we can have
the True God for our God: <hi>Iosh. 24. 23.
Put away the strange Gods which are among
you, and incline your Heart to the Lord God
of Israel.</hi> Naturally our God is our Belly,
while Carnal, <hi>Phil. 3. 19. Mammon</hi> is
our God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 24. The Devil is our
God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. And, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 2, 3.
<hi>Wherein in times past ye walked according
to the course of this World, according to the
Prince of the Power of the Air, the Spirit
that now worketh in the Children of Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
Among whom also we all had our
Conversation in times past, in the Lusts of
our Flesh, fulfilling the Desires of the Flesh,
and of the Mind; and were by Nature the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64994:233"/>
Children of Wrath, even as others.</hi> Besides,
the Nature of the thing, Baptism impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
this Renunciation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. And
this Renunciation is nothing else but a
forsaking all, that we may have eternal
Life by Christ.</p>
                  <p>2. It appeareth; by Reasons.</p>
                  <p>For (1.) Faith cannot be without this
forsaking;</p>
                  <p>Nor, (2.) this forsaking without Faith.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Faith cannot be without this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking.
For Faith implieth a sight of the
Truth and Worth of those blessed Things
which are to come, and so to take the
Thing promised for our Happiness, and
the promise for our Security. 1. There is
no true sound Faith, till we take the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Fruition of God in Glory for our
whole Felicity, till our Hearts be set upon
it, and we do desire it, intend it, wait
for it, as the chief Good and Blessedness.
The upright Heart is known by its Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
Mat. 6. 20, 21. <hi>Lay up Treasure in
Heaven; for where your Treasure is, there
your Heart will be also.</hi> Now if this be so,
other things will be lessened, all other
Hopes and Happiness is nothing worth;
and will appear so, if compared with this
better part, with what we account our
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64994:233"/>
Treasure; you will see all this World is
Vanity, and hath nothing in it worthy to
be compared with the Salvation of our
Souls. 2. There is no true Faith, where
the Word and Promise of God is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for our Security, so as our Trust in
his Word, may quiet and embolden us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Temptations, and give us stronger
Consolation than all the visible things on
Earth, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 119. 111. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18.
We should do more, and go farther upon
such a Promise, than for all that Man can
give unto us. Earthly Pleasures and Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions
should be small things in regard of
the Promise of God. This should make
us row against the stream of the Flesh,
and cross its desires and appetites, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Conveniencies of the World, and
all because we have God's Promise of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things.</p>
                  <p>(2.) This forsaking cannot be without
Faith; because the Flesh is importunate
to be pleased with present Satisfactions,
and loth to part with things which we see
and love, for that God and Glory which
we never saw; to quit what is present,
for what is future, and with patience to
be expected. The Flesh is for pleasing
the Body, but Faith is for saving the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64994:234"/>
Soul, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 39. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>:
Purchasing the Soul with the loss
of other things. So that this is Faith, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Faith, and other Faith is not
true and sound.</p>
                  <p>2. It maketh us to give up our selves
to the conduct of the Word and Spirit
for obtaining this Happiness. I add this,
because the Word is our Rule, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the Spirit our Guide, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14.
And Faith is not only an apprehension of
Privileges, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> of Subjection:

                     </gap>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of God. 2 Cor. 8. 8. <hi>They first
gave up themselves to the Lord, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the Will of God;</hi> that is, to the Apostles
as Christ's Messengers, to be directed in
the Way to Heaven: Psal. 119. 38. <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
thy Word unto thy Servant, who is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to thy fear.</hi> This now is saving-Faith.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Vse</hi> is, to exhort you to believe
to the saving of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>To this end;</p>
                  <p>1. Because Faith is the Gift of God, beg
<hi>the Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64994:234"/>
your Eyes may be opened, that you may see
what is the Hope of his Calling, and what
the Riches of the Glory of his Inheritance in
the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 17, 18. That you
may be convinced of the truth and worth
of the Blessedness promised, and know
and see it, not by a traditional Report,
but in the lively Light of the Spirit, such
as may affect and engage your Hearts.
Naturally we are purblind, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9.
have no accute discerning, but in Back
and Belly Concernments. We know what
is noxious or comfortable to the present
Life, pleasing or displeasing to the Flesh;
but are little affected with the danger of
perishing for ever, the need of Christ, or
the worth of Salvation: and till God
make a change, how slight and sensual are
we!</p>
                  <p>2. Think often and seriously how
much the saving of the Soul, is better
than the saving, or getting, or keeping all
the World. Matth. 16. 26. <hi>What will it
profit a Man, if he should gain the whole
World, and lose his own Soul?</hi> So much as
God is to be preferred before the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Heaven before the World, Eternity
before Time, the Soul before the Body;
so much must this Business of saving the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64994:235"/>
Soul have the preheminence, and be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before the Interests of the Body,
and the bodily Life. But alas! what
poor things divert us from this Happiness;
the satisfying of the Flesh, the pleasures of
Sin for a season; a little Ease, or Profit,
or vain-Glory; this is all for which we
slight Heaven, and our own Salvation.</p>
                  <p>3. Put your selves into the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
by s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eking Reconciliation with
God by Christ. You are invited in the
universal conditional Offer, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16.
'Tis offered to all that will repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and there is no exception put in
against you to exclude you; Why then
will you exclude your self? Therefore
come forward in the way of Faith, and
God will help you.</p>
                  <p>4. Mind often the genuine Effect of
the True Faith. It makes you forsake all,
that you may be obedient to Christ, and
resolved upon it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore consider, 1. the Necessity
of it: You can neither trust God, nor
be true to him, till your Heart be loosened
from the Pleasures, and Profits, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
in the World; and you can ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
all upon the security of his Promise,
other Hopes and Happiness will divert us
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64994:235"/>
from the true Happiness; and the good
feed will be choaked by the cares of this
World, and voluptuous Living, that you
can bring nothing to perfection. Either
you will turn aside by open Defection
or Apostacy, or else be a Dwarf and
Cripple in Religion all your days; either
in Mortification, in denying the sinful
Pleasures of the Senses, you will slight
the fulness of Joy at God's right Hand,

                  <p>THE words belong to the Story of
the first Marriage that ever was
celebrated in the World, between
the first Man, and the first Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
a Marriage made by God himself in
Paradise; who, when he built the Rib
taken from <hi>Adam</hi> into a Woman, from a
Builder, becometh her Bringer, <hi>He brought
her unto the Man,</hi> saith the Text.</p>
                  <p>God's bringing <hi>Eve</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> implieth
five things.</p>
                  <p>1. His Permission, Allowance, and
Grant; for that <hi>Adam</hi> might thankfully
acknowledg the Benefit, as coming from
God. God himself brought her, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64994:237"/>
in a visi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>le shape, as prefiguring
Christ's Incarnation, and with what Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
he brought her, since the Holy
Ghost hath not expressed it, I shall not
now enquire; it is enough that God
brought her to give her to him as his
inseparable Companion and meet-Helper.
This bringing was the full bestowing her
upon him, that they should live together
as Man and Wife.</p>
                  <p>2. His Institution and Appointment of
Marriage, as the means of propagating
Manki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Interpretation, <hi>conjunxit;</hi> Mark 19.
6. <hi>Those whom God hath joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
&amp;c. Otherwise what need this
bringing, for she was created just by him
in Paradise, when <hi>Adam</hi> was fallen into
a deep sleep; not in another place, which
sheweth that <hi>Marriage is an honourable
Estate.</hi> God was the first Author of it,
his Act hath the force of an Institution.</p>
                  <p>3. For the greater solemnity, and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
order of Marriage. <hi>Adam</hi> did not
take her of his own head, but God
brought her to him; when we dispose of
our selves at our own Wills and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
being led thereunto by our own
choice, without consulting with God;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64994:237"/>
or upon carnal Reasons, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of God's Providence, we transgress
the Order which God hath set in the first
Precedent of Marriage; and cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that our coming together should be
comfortable. Much more doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the unnatural filthiness of Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
whereby Men and Women join and
mingle themselves together without God,
the Devil and their inordinate Lusts
leading them. God would not put <hi>Adam</hi>
and <hi>Eve</hi> together without some regard, as
he did the brutish and unreasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
but doth solemnly, as it were,
bring the Manness by the hand to the
Man, and deliver her into his hands,
having a more honourable regard and
care of them: God cannot abide that
brutish coming together as the Horses do,
neighing, in the rage of unbridled Lusts,
upon their Mates, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5. 8. No, <hi>Adam</hi>
stayeth till she is brought to him. This
Honour and special Favour God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safeth
Mankind above all other Creatures;
he himself, in his own Person, maketh the
Match, and bringeth them together.</p>
                  <p>4. To dispense his Blessing to them.
The Woman was created on the sixth
day, as appeareth <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. and it is said,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64994:238"/>
that <hi>when he had created them Male and
Female, he blessed them,</hi> vers. 28. He doth
inlarge things here, and explaineth what
there he had touched briefly; when he
had made the Woman, he brought her
to the Man, and blessed them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
shewing thereby, that when any
enter into this Estate, they should take
God's Blessing along with them; upon
whose Favour, the comfort of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
doth wholly depend. Those whom
God bringeth into it, are likely to fare
best; and they that resign themselves up
into his hands, to be disposed of by him,
surely take the readiest way to obtain the
Happiness they expect.</p>
                  <p>5. For a Pattern of Providence in all
after-Times. It is worth the observing,
that Christ reasoning against Poligamy,
from <hi>vers.</hi> 24. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.
God having abundance of the Spirit, as
the Prophet speaks, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 15. brought
the Woman to one Man, tho there was
more cause of giving <hi>Adam</hi> many Wives,
for the speedier peopling of the World,
than there could be to any of his Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
As Christ observeth the number, so
we may observe the thing it self, it is
God's Work still to give every one his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64994:238"/>
Marriage-Companion; he bringeth the
Woman to the Husband, and every Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
to his Wife, that meet as they ought
to do. His Providence doth mightily and
evidently govern all Circumstances that
concern this Affair, as we shall shew you
by and by.</p>
                  <p>The Point which I shall insist on, is
this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> That Marriages are then holily
entred into, when the Parties take
one another out of God's hands.</p>

God's hands.</item>
                     <item>II. Why this is so necessary to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I. For the first; They take one another
out of God's hands, Two ways.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. When his Directions are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</item>

                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:64994:239"/>1. When his Directions in his Word
are observed. And so,</p>
                  <p>(1.) As to the choice of Parties. When
a Man seeketh out a Help-meet for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he should in the first place seek out
a Help-meet for himself in the best things;
for in all our deliberate and serious Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
Religion must have the first place.
Mat. 6. 37. <hi>Seek ye first the Kingdom of
God, and the Righteousness thereof,</hi> &amp;c. A
Man's chief End should be discovered in
all his Actions, as it must guide me in my
Meat, and Drink, and Recreations, and
the ordinary Refreshments of the natural
Life, or else I do not act as a Christian:
So much more in my most important and
serious Affairs, such as Marriage is, and
upon which my Content and Welfare so
much dependeth. Certainly he that would
take God's Blessing along with him, should
make choice in God's Family of one,
with whom he may converse as an Heir
with him of the Grace of Life. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
saith the Apostle, is at liberty to
marry, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but only in
the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 39. he is at liberty to
rejoice, but in the Lord; to eat, and
drink, and trade, but in the Lord; so to
marry, but in the Lord. Religion must
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64994:239"/>
appear uppermost in all his Actions, and
guide him throughout. The Mischiefs
that have come by a carnal Choice, should
be sufficient warning to Christians. <hi>Gen.
6. 2. The Sons of God went in unto the
Daughters of Men, and took them VVives,
because they were fair:</hi> they were swayed
by carnal Motives, (or because Rich, or
nobly descended, it is all one): And
what was the issue of it? there came of
them a mungrel Race of Giants, that
rose up against God and his Interest in the
World. Many times by a carnal choice,
all the good that is gotten into a Family is
eaten out, and within a little while Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is cast out of doors. <hi>Psal. 105. 35.
They were mingled among the Heathen, and
learned their Works.</hi> Nehem. 13. 25, 26.
<hi>I contended with them, and made them swear
by God, Ye shall not give your Daughters
to their Sons, nor take their Daughters to
your Sons.</hi> 2 Kings 8. 18. <hi>He walked in
the Ways of the Kings of Israel; for the
Daughter of</hi> Ahab <hi>was his Wife. Valens</hi>
the Emperor married with an <hi>Arrian</hi> Lady,
and so was ensnared so far, as to become
a Persecutor of the Orthodox. The Wife
of the Bosom hath great advantages, either
to the perverting, or the converting a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64994:240"/>
Man's Heart to God: or else if they
should not prevail so far, What dissonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and jarrings are there in a Family,
when People are unequally yoked, the
Wife and Husband drawing several ways?</p>
                  <p>(2.) As to consent of Parents. God
here in the Text, as the common Parent,
taketh himself to have the greatest hand
in the bestowing of his own Children;
He <hi>brought her unto the Man;</hi> and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Parents are his Deputies, which must
bring and give us in Marriage, especially
when young, and under their Power.
The Scripture is express for this, <hi>Exod. 22.
17. If her Father wholly refuse to give her
unto him,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 17. 28. <hi>He that
giveth her in Marriage,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>(3.) As to the manner of procuring it;
that they labour to gain one another by
warrantable, yea, r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ligious Ways, that

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y the Foundation of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
in the Fear of God; not by stealth,
or carnal Allurements, or violent Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities,
or deceitful Proposals, but by
such ways and means as will become the
gravity of Religion, that weanedness and
sobriety that should be in the Hearts of
Believers; that deliberation which a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of such weight calls for, and that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64994:240"/>
of God, and Justice that we owe
to all; that seriousness of Spirit, and that
respect to the Glory of God, with which
all such Actions should be underken.
Col. 3. 17. <hi>Whatsoever we do, in Word or
in Deed, do all in the Name of the Lord
Iesus, giving thanks to God and the Father
by him.</hi> When this is observed, we are
said to take one another out of God's
Hands.</p>
                  <p>(4.) Especially clearing up our Right
and Title by Christ. Meats, Drinks, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
they are all sanctified by the Word
and Prayer, and appointed to be received
by thanksgiving of them that believe and
receive the Truth; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5.
There is a two-fold Right, <hi>Dominium Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticum
&amp; Evangelicum. Dominium Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum
fundatur in Providentiâ. Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licum
in Gratiâ.</hi> Political Right is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in God's Providence, Evangelical Right
in Grace. We have a Civil Right to all
that cometh to us by honest Labour, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Purchace or Inheritance, and fair
and comely Means used; which giveth us
a Right, not only before Men, but before
God; not by virtue of their Laws, but
his Grant. By a Providential-Right, all
wicked Men possess all outward things,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64994:241"/>
which they enjoy as the Fruits and Gifts
of his common Bounty, it is their Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<hi>Psalm.</hi> 17. 14. Whatever falleth to
their share in the course of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
they are not Usurpers meerly for
possessing what they have, but for abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
what they have. They have not only
a civil Right to prevent the Incroachments
of others, by the Laws of Men, but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential
Right before God, and are not
simply responsible for the Possession, but
the Use. But then there is an Evangelical
or New-Covenant Right. So Believers
have a Right to their Creature-Comforts
by God's special Conveyance, that sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
every Mercy, that it comes wrapt in
the Bowels of Christ. The little which
the Righteous hath, is better than the
Treasures of many wicked; as the mean
fair of a poor Subject, is better than the
Dainties of a condemned Traitor. And
this we have by Christ, as the Heir of
all things, and we by him, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. latter
end.</hi> So all those things do belong to
them that believe, as Gifts of his fatherly
Love and Goodness to us in Christ; as we
take our Bread out of Christ's hands, so
we must be married to Christ, before mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to one another; the Marriage-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64994:241"/>
should be begun and concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Christ and you.</p>
                  <p>(5.) For the End; the general and last
End of this, as of every Action, must be
God's Glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. and <hi>Col.</hi> 3.
17. A Christian's Second-Table Duties,
and First-Table Duties, should have on
them holiness to the Lord. All the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> must have God's Impress.
More particularly our increase in Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the propagation of the Holy
Seed, must be aimed at. Where one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is a Believer, much more where both,
they beget Sons and Daughters to God;
<hi>But now are they holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 14. But
those out of the Church, beget Sons and
Daughters to Men, merely to people the
World. <hi>Seth</hi>'s Children are called <hi>Sons
of God,</hi> Gen. 6. 1, 2. In the careful Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Children, the Church is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held.</p>
                  <p>2. When his Providence is owned and
acknowledged. It is the Duty of them
that fear God, to own him upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
especially in such a Business. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
would not begin such a Business
without a Sacrifice. There is a special
Providence about Marriages. God claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64994:242"/>
the Power of Match-making to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
more than he doth of ordering any
other Affairs of Men: Prov. 19. 14. <hi>Riches
and Honours are an Inheritance from our
Fathers; but a good Wife is from the Lord.</hi>
Inheritances pass by the Laws of Men,
though not without the intervention of
God's Providence, who determineth to
every Man the time of his Service, and
the bounds of his Habitation, where eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man shall live, and what he shall enjoy.
The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was divided by <hi>Lot;</hi>
but Marriage is by the special Destinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Providence, either for a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
to Men, or for a Comfort and a
Blessing. Here Providence is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate,
by its influence upon the Hearts
of Men; here Providence is more strange
and remarkable, in casting all Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Passages that did concern it.
Estates fall to us by more easy and obvious
Means; and therefore though nothing be
exempted from the Dominion of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
yet a good Wife is especially said
to be of the Lord. So also, <hi>Prov. 18.
22. Whoso findeth a Wife, findeth a good
Thing, and obtaineth favour of the Lord.</hi>
A Wife, that is a Wife indeed, one that
deserveth that Name: he that findeth her,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64994:242"/>
it is a chance to him, but an ordered
thing by God; he hath not only experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of God's Care, but his Goodness and
Free-grace to him in that particular. Well
then, God must be owned, sought, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in this particular. The Husband in
the Catalogue and Inventory of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
must not forget to bless God for this,
and the Wife for the Husband; the Lord
was gracious in providing for me a good
Companion; I obtained favour from the
Lord. God is concerned in this whole
Affair, he brought the Woman to the
Man; he giveth the Portion, which is not
so much the Dowry given by the Parents,
which is little worth, unless his Blessing
be added with it, as all the Graces and
Abilities by which all married Persons are
made helpful one to another. He giveth
the Children, <hi>Psalm. 127. 3. Lo, Children
are an Heritage from the Lord;</hi> Their
Conception and Formation in the Womb
is from God. Parents know not whether
it be Male or Female, beautiful or defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
They know not the number of the
Bones, and Veins and Arteries. He giveth
them Life; a Sentence of Death way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layeth
them as soon as they come into the
World. He giveth them Comfort; there
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64994:243"/>
is a great deal of Pride, and Arrogancy,
and Self-willedness in all the Sons and
Daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> which makes them
uncomfortable in their Relations. A Wife
would soon prove a <hi>Iezabel,</hi> and not an
<hi>Abigail;</hi> and a Husband a <hi>Nabal,</hi> and
not a <hi>David,</hi> by Satan's Malice, and our
own Corruption; an Help would soon
become a Snare. They that would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Duties of this Relation, need
strongly to be supported with the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of God's Spirit. <hi>Finally, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
be strong in the Lord, and in the
Power of his Might,</hi> Ephes. 6. 10. So
that since God giveth all, surely his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
must be owned and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged;
and you ought to say, This is
the Wife God hath chosen for me, and
this is the Husband God hath chosen for
me.</p>
                  <p>II. Why is this so nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ry a Duty. It
doth in a great measure appear, from what
is said already. But farther;</p>
                  <p>1. It will be a great engagement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, to give God all the Glory of
the Comfort we have in such a Relation,
when you do more sensibly and explicitly
take one another out of God's Hands.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64994:243"/>
We are apt to look to second Causes; he
that sendeth the Present is the giver, not he
that bringeth it to us. The <hi>Romans</hi> were
wont once a Year to cast Garlands into
their Fountains, by that superstition own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the benefit they had by them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it hath a good Moral to us in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
of it, that we should own the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of our Blessings, and not ascribe them
to our own Wisdom and Foresight, but
the Grace and Favour of God; who in
the meer Lottery and Chance of humane
Affairs, was pleased to chuse so well for
us. <hi>Iacob</hi> owned his Fountain, when he
was become two Bands, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 10. So
should we; of him, through him, to him,
do mutually infer one another. What we
have from God, must be used for God.
God is very jealous that we will not look
to the Original and first cause of our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
Hos. 2. 8. <hi>She did not know that I
gave her Corn, and Wine, and Oil; and
multiplied her Silver and Gold, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
will I return, and take away my Corn,
and Wine, and Oil, and Flax,</hi> &amp;c. It is
the way to lose our Comforts, when we
do not own and acknowledg God's Hand
in them. We are drowned in sense, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured
and accustomed to second Causes; so
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64994:244"/>
that God's Hand is invisible and little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
we know it not, or heed it not.
Now that we may look up and own the
first Cause, and give him his due Honour,
it is good to have explicit and actual
thoughts in the receiving of our Mercies,
so as to take them out of God's Hand; to
draw aside the Vail and Covering of the
Creature, that you may remember the
Giver.</p>
                  <p>2. That we may carry our selves more
holily in our Relations, it is good to see
God's Hand in them. Every Relation is
a new Talent wherewith God intrusteth
us to trade for his Glory; and to that
end we must make Conscience to use it.
In <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. the Master delivered to every
one his Goods apart, and they that had
the Benefit, received the Charge. We
are often pressed to do things, as in and
to the Lord upon religious and gracious
Reasons. It hath been the credit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<hi>Dent tales Mercatores, tales Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos,
tales Exactores fisci,</hi> &amp;c. Let History
shew such Husbands, such Wives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
Christian Religion maketh a Man consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiously
careful and tender of his Duty
to Man; not from a natural Principle, or
from our own Ease, Peace, and Credit,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64994:244"/>
but from the Conscience of our Duty to
God. Now it must not lose this Credit
by you. God puts us into Relations, to
see how we will glorify him in them;
there is something more required of you
then as single Christians. God that puts a
Man into the Ministry, requireth that he
should honour him, not only as a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
but as a Minister. And God that
calleth a Man into Magistracy, requireth
that he should honour him as a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.
So to be a Master of a Family, and
a Wife or Husband, there is another Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to be accounted for. An Ambassador
that is sent into a Foreign Country about
special Business, must give an account,
not only as a Traveller, but as an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassor,
of the Business he was intrusted
with. God will have honour by you as
a Wife, or as a Husband; you have a
new opportunity to make Religion amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the unbelieving World may see
how profitable the heavenly Life is to
humane Society.</p>
                  <p>3. That we may more patiently bear
the Crosses incident to this state of Life,
if God call us to them. They that launch
forth into the World, sail in a troublesome
and tempestuous Sea, and cannot expect
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64994:245"/>
but to meet with a Storm before they
come to the end of their Voyage. The
married Life hath its Comforts, and also
its Encumbrances and Sorrows. Now it
will sweeten all our Crosses incident to
this Condition, when we remember we
did not rashly enter into it by our own
choice, but were led by the fair directure
and fair invitation of God's Providence,
we need not much be troubled at what
overtaketh us in the way of our Duty,
and the Relations to which we are called;
that Hand that sent the Trouble, will
sanctify it; or he will over-rule things so,
that they shall work for our good. If
God call us into this Estate, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
us in it. It is a great satisfaction to
you, that you are acting that part in the
World, which God would have you act;
that you can say, I am there where God
hath set me, and therefore will bear the
Troubles that attend that state and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Life. If a Man run on his own
Head, and Inconveniences arise, they are
more uncomfortably born. It is true,
that God doth fetch off his People
from the Afflictions they have brought
upon themselves by their Sin and Folly,
such is the indulgence of his Grace; yet
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64994:245"/>
those Sufferings are the more uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that take us out of the way of our
Duty; and God hath undertaken only
to keep us in all our Ways, but not out
of our Duty, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 91. 11. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
are not to foster Men in their run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
after Folly, but to encourage them
in their several Callings, and state of Life
wherein God hath set them; there we may
abide with comfort, and expectation either
of God's Blessing, or his Support. We
tempt God, when we venture upon a
state of Life which he hath not called us
to, and have not his Warrant; but when
it is not good for us to be alone, and the
Lord sends an help-meet for us, he will not
forsake us.</p>
                  <p>4. We may with the more confidence
apply our s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lves to God, and depend on
him for a Blessing upon a Wife of God's
chusing, or an Husband of God's chusing.
We have access to the Throne of Grace
with more hope, because we have given
up our selves to his Direction. <hi>Prov. 3.
6. In all thy ways acknowledg him, and he
shall direct thy Paths.</hi> God will order
things for the best, when we do not lead,
but follow him, we still co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and dare not undertake any thing, but
what is agreeable to his Will. And will
God mislead us, and direct us amiss; or turn
us into a by-way, or crooked-path? It is
said, <hi>Psal. 37. 23, 24. The Steps of a good
Man are ordered by the Lord, and he</hi> (that
is, the Lord) <hi>delighteth in his way; though
he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down, for
the Lord upholdeth him with his hand.</hi> It is
a blessed thing to be under God's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
to be led on, or led off by so wise,
and powerful, and alsufficient a Guide;
for such, he delights to do them good, and
taketh pleasure in his Resolutions, to
prosper them. Sometimes they shall have
a taste of the Evils of the World, but
they shall not be ruined by them: They
may fall, but they shall not be dashed in
pieces; it is an Allusion to a Vessel that
gets a knock, but is not broken by the
fall.</p>
                  <p>5. It is an help to make us more ready
to part with one another when God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it. All temporal things, we receive
them from God, upon this condition, to
yield them up to God again, when he calls
for them. The Law concerning all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Injoyments, is, <hi>The Lord giveth, the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64994:246"/>
Lord taketh,</hi> Job 1. 21. We make a Snare
for our selves, and receive them not in a
right Notion, if we do not receive them
as mortal and perishing Comforts, which
God may demand at pleasure, and so
keep the Soul loose, and in a posture of
submission, if God should cross us, and
disappoint us in them. Thus must we use
all outward Comforts with that weaned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and moderation, as to Children, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
and all temporal Blessings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
that will become a sense of the frailty
that is in them, and the wheelings and
turnings of an uncertain World. It is
the Apostle's Direction, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31. The
time is short, it remains that those that
have Wives, be as though they had none;
not as to be defective in our Love to them,
and care over them; no, there is rather
to be an excess, than a defect here; <hi>Prov.
5. 19. Be thou ravish'd always with her
Love.</hi> But as to a preparation of Heart,
to keep or lose, if God should see fit, to
be contented to part with a dear Yoke-fellow,
or at least with an humble Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and acquiescence, when God's
Will is declared; and somewhat of this
must be mingled with all our rejoicings,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64994:247"/>
some thoughts of the Vanity of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Leavened Bread was to be eaten
with the Thank-offerings in the Feast of
Tabernacles, when the Barns were full.
<hi>Man at his best estate is Vanity,</hi> Psal. 39. 5.
Now to help us to do this, it is good to
consider, he that hath the right to give,
hath also the right of taking away; and
as you must not be overjoyed with the
receiving, so not be over-sad with part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

asked counsel of God. <hi>David</hi> always
ran to the Oracle of the Ephod; <hi>Shall I

God's Right and Soveraignty.
'Tis robbery to make use of a Man's
goods, and to waste them and consume
them without his leave. All that we have
or use is God's, who reserveth the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of all to himself. In distributing to the
Creatures, he never intended to divest
himself of his Right. As an Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
by sowing his Corn in the Field, is
not dispossessed of a Right to it. God hath

God brought her to him, and bestowed
her on him. Every one of us must get a

                        </gap>sseth the House that we
dwell in, the Cloaths we wear, the Food
we eat: And so in the use of all other
Comforts, we must have a License from
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64994:248"/>
God, and take his Leave. God is said to
have given <hi>David</hi> the Wives that he had
into his Bosom.</p>
                     <p>2. His Counsel and Direction, when
the case is doubtful, and our thoughts are
uncertain. Prov. 3. 5. <hi>Lean not to thy own
Vnderstanding.</hi> We scarce know Duties,
certainly we cannot foresee Events; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Man that maketh his Bosom his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
his Wit his Counsellor, will chuse a
Mischief to himself, instead of a Comfort
and a Blessing. Therefore we ought
chiefly, and first of all, to consult with
God, and seek his Direction, for he
seeth the Heart, and foreseeth Events.
We can only look upon what is present,
and there upon the outward appearance:
Therefore God can best direct us in our
choice, he knoweth the fittest Matches
and Consorts for every one; who hath
a prospect of all things in one moment of
time, and by one act of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;
and so can best dispose of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Affairs, for the profit and comfort
of the Creature. Jer. 10. 23. <hi>O Lord, I
know that the way of Man is not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
nor is it in the Sons of Men to direct
their steps;</hi> that is, to order their Affairs
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64994:249"/>
so as they may have felicity and comfort
in them. So, <hi>Prov. 20. 24. Man's goings
are of the Lord; how can a Man then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
his own way?</hi> We cannot fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
the Event of things, what is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
what not. Man would fain work
out his Happiness like a Spider, climb up
by a Thread of his own spinning. But
alas! all our Devices and fine Contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are gone with the turn of a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>som.
He that will be his own Carver, seldom
carveth out a good Portion to himself:
They intrench upon God's Prerogative,
and take the Work out of his hands;
and therefore no wonder if their Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
be turned into Folly.</p>
                     <p>3. We ask his Blessing. God doth not
only foresee the Event, but order it; by
his Wisdom he foreseeth it, and by his
powerful Providence he bringeth it to
pass. Therefore God that hath the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of all Events, when our D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is over, is to be sought unto for a Blessing;
for every Comfort cometh the sooner,
when it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ought in Prayer; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
God's Purposes be, that is our Duty.
Jer. 29. 11, 12. <hi>I know the thoughts that I
think towards you, saith the Lord, thoughts
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64994:249"/>
of Peace, and not of Evil, to give you an
expected End. Then shall ye call upon me,
and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I
will hearken unto you.</hi> Ezek. 36. 37. <hi>I
will for this be enquired of by the House of
Israel, to do it for them.</hi> So in this Case,
we read, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 2. When there was a
Marriage in <hi>Canaan</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> both Jesus
was called and his Disciples to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
Married Persons do need, and
therefore should seek Christ's Presence to
their Marriage, that he would vouchsafe
his Presence and Countenance: Be sure to
invite him, and take him along with you,
that he may strengthen you by his Grace,
and dispose all Providences about you
for your Comfort. He puts the greatest
honour upon the Marriage, when he doth
enable you to carry your selves graciously
in that Relation, and to God's Glory;
and he hath the power of all Providences
put into his hand, as well as all Grace.</p>

                     <list>
                        <item>1. Negatively. See that God be no

                           <pb n="92" facs="tcp:64994:250"/>2. Positively. Be sure that God be a
gainer.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>These are the two Proffers I have to
make to you.</p>
                     <p>1. Negatively. Let not God be a
loser; He never intended to give you
Gifts to his own wrong.</p>
                     <p>Now that will be;</p>
                     <p>(1.) If he be not the only One, and
the lovely one of your Souls. God must
not have an Image of Jealousy set up;
He must still be owned as the chiefest
Good. A Wife is the Delight of the
Eyes, but not the Idol of the Heart:
Still you must be sure that his Place be
not invaded; that you may say, <hi>Psal. 73.
25. Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and
whom do I desire on Earth in comparison of
thee?</hi> Carnal Complacency must not
weaken your Delight in God; it is apt to
do so. The excuse of one of those that

thereby, that this Relation may become a
Snare, and encroach upon the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64994:250"/>
of God; he may be justled out of
the Heart, by the intrusion of some
earthly Comfort.</p>
                     <p>(2.) If you be diverted from the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
pursuit of heavenly Things, either by
carnal Complacency, or distracting Cares,
and worldly Encumbrances. There will
be a time, when we shall <hi>neither Marry,
nor be given in Marriage,</hi> Luke 20. 35.
And that is our happiest time; present
Contentments must not weaken the lively
expectation of it, and steal away the
Heart into a mindlesness of it. Would
God bring you to one another? think
you, to turn off your Thoughts and
Hopes for this blessed Time, when he
shall be All in All? No, your Comforts
by the way in your Pilgrimage, must not
hinder your delight in your Comforts at
Home, and in your Country: this would
be like a great Heir in Travel, that should
gussle in an Ale-house, and never think of
returning to his Inheritance.</p>
                     <p>(3.) God would be a loser, if you be
less resolute in owning God's Truth, than
you were before. Oh take heed of daub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Religion! we must hate all for
Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 26. We must be as true
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64994:251"/>
still to make good our Ingagement to
him. Wife and Children must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued
for the Gospel; we may be put
to the trial, whether we will cleave to
them or Christ, who is our choice Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
The Bond of Religion is above
all Bonds; all Bonds between Husband
and Wife, Father and Children, end in
Death; but the Bond of Christ is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
your Children will not lose by your
faithfulness to God.</p>
                     <p>2. Positively. Let God be a gainer.</p>
                     <p>(1.) By your daily praises and blessing
God for his Providence, that hath brought
you into this Relation. <hi>I obtained favour
from the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(2.) <hi>By living to God in this Relation,
performing the Duties thereof, so as your
converse may be some lively resemblance
of the Communion between Christ and
his Church;</hi> Ephes. 5. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29,
30. Husbands, love your Wives, even as
Christ also loved the Church, and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for it: That he might sanctify and
cleanse it with the washing of Water, by the
Word; That he might present it to himself
a glorious Church, not having spot or wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64994:251"/>
or any such thing: but that it should be
holy, and without blemish. So ought Men
to love their Wives, as their own Bodies:
he that loveth his Wife, loveth himself. For
no Man ever yet hated his own Flesh, but
nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the
Lord the Church. For we are Members of
his Body, of his Flesh, and of his Bones.</p>
                     <p>(3.) By being mutual helps to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the best things, by the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Piety and Godliness. The love
of Christ doth not only enforce the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's
Duty as an Argument, but points
forth the right manner of it as a Pattern:
Christ's Love, is sanctifying Love; so
should theirs be, such a Love as sheweth
it self by sincere and real endeavours, to
bring about one anothers spiritual and
eternal Good. Love one another, <hi>as
Heirs together of the Grace of Life,</hi> 1 Pet.
