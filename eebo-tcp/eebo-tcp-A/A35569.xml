            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>But if all this will not ſerve to perſwade men, that are not wont eaſily to believe any thing, that croſſeth their fancies, though of it ſelfe never ſo probable, or plauſible: why yet I hope, if wee can produce ſome <hi>Formulae</hi> of thoſe very Prayers then uſed, that they will at laſt yield to the truth.

               <p>Now wee come to the examination of his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93253:8"/>
objections againſt ours, and proofs for his own aſſertion. His words are: [<hi>But that there were not ſuch ſtinted Liturgies, as this Remonſtrant diſputes for, appears by</hi> Tertullian, <hi>in his Apol. cap.</hi> 30. <hi>where hee ſaith the Chriſtians of thoſe times did in their publike Aſſemblies pray ſine Monitore, quia depectore, without any Prompter, but their own hearts. And that ſo it ſhould be the ſame Authour proves in his Treatiſe, de Oratione: Sunt quae petantur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>There are ſome things to bee asked according to the occaſions of every man: the lawfull and ordinary Prayer (that is the Lords Prayer) being layd as a foundation; it is lawfull to build upon that founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion other Prayers according to every ones occaſions. And to the ſame purpoſe, Saint</hi> Auguſtine <hi>in his</hi> 121 <hi>Ep. Liberum eſt,</hi> &amp;.] The paſſages out of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian de Oratione,</hi> and out of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in his 121 <hi>Ep.</hi> are nothing at all to the purpoſe, and make as much for publike ſet Prayers, as for private: for publike ſet Prayers alſo are grounded upon this, That it is lawfull to adde to the Lords Prayer. What any Father ads of any mans particular occaſions, may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of private Prayers, whether at home, or in the Church. For it is out of all queſtion, and we have ſtore of examples to that purpoſe, that the Chriſtians of thoſe times did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repaire to the Churches in private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and for particular occaſions. But now to the paſſage of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> out of his <hi>Apol. c.</hi> 30 where hee makes <hi>Tertullian</hi> to ſay, that the Chriſtians of thoſe times did in their publike
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93253:8"/>
Aſſemblies pray <hi>ſine monitore, quia de pectore</hi>: I ſay, firſt, that it doth not appeare by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that he ſpeaks it of publike Aſſemblies, and more probable it is that he doth not. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I would know of this Authour, what it is that he would have, or doth inferre upon this paſſage of <hi>Tertullian.</hi> What, that Chriſtians, when they aſſembled together, did betake themſelves every one to his own private devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and uſed ſuch prayers, every man by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as his owne heart, and particular occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did ſuggeſt unto him? This if hee ſay, (beſides that it is very abſurd in it ſelfe, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver practiſed any where, that I know, amongſt Orthodox Chriſtians) will eaſily be refuted by expreſſe paſſages of ancient Fathers, as <hi>Ignatius,</hi> Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and others, who teach the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of joynt and unanimous common Prayers at ſuch times. But it is apparent, that that which our Authour drives at by his whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, is, not that the people, but the Miniſter is to be left to his owne liberty, to uſe in publike Aſſemblies what forme of prayer himſelfe thinks fit. And are not then <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> words (if underſtood as hee would have them, of publike Prayers) as much againſt this kind of praying with and after the Miniſter his conceived prayer; as he cals it: as againſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Book-prayers? Nay, if there be any difference, they may more truly be ſaid to pray <hi>cum monitore,</hi> who follow the conceptions of a private man, then they that follow a <hi>publike, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, uſual form,</hi> which having often heard, it is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93253:9"/>
likely that in time they learn and can ſay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out book; ſo far at leaſt, as to follow it readily, and with a quicke and cleere apprehenſion of what is ſaid: whereas they that depend of <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conceptions,</hi> which are not always the ſame, muſt needs have their underſtandings ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, till the end of the ſentence; and when at the end, have much adoe, ſometimes, to make ſence of it.</p>
               <p>I have heard more then once ſome men, who thought themſelves as good at it as the beſt, make this objection againſt <hi>ſet</hi> or <hi>ſtinted</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as they call them, becauſe by them the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is ſtreightned. Which though it be but a fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous objection, and eaſily anſwered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the nature of thoſe men, for the moſt part, not to be ſatisfied with any reaſon that proceeds from men, whom they affect not: I was glad to ſee it, in a book which lately came to my hands, fully anſwered by one, whoſe name (I intend it not as a reproach to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, whom I have heard men of ſingular worth to ſpeak of, with great reſpect:) is great amongſt them. It comes very neere to the point that wee are now upon, and therefore I ſhall not thinke much to ſet downe here the whole paſſage.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93253:9"/>
more liberty, (as hee is in conceived prayers) and not tied to a ſtrict form.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To this I anſwer, even thoſe men that are againſt this and that uſe this reaſon, they doe the ſame thing daily in the congregation for when another prays, that is a ſet forme to him that heares it; I ſay it is a forme to him: for put the caſe, that hee which is an hearer, and doth attend another praying, ſuppoſe that his ſpirit be more enlarged, it is a ſtraitning to him, he hath no liberty to go out, he is bound to keep his mind intent upon that which the other prayeth: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if that were a ſufficient reaſon, that a man might not uſe a ſet form, becauſe the ſpirit is ſtraitned, a man ſhould not heare another pray though it be a conceived prayer) becauſe in that caſe his ſpirit is limited; it may be the hearer hath a larger heart (a great deale) then he that ſpeaks and prays ſo that there is a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtraitning, and a limiting of the ſpirit to him. And therefore that reaſon cannot be good. Again I anſwer,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I have no more to ſay concerning this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> but that (as is well obſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rved by thoſe that comment upon him) his chiefe aime in theſe words (and that which gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion unto them) was, to deride the cuſtome of the Heathens of his time, who truly and really in their, whether private or publike, Temple devotions did uſe ſuch <hi>Monitors</hi> or <hi>Prompters,</hi> to ſuggeſt unto them the true titles and manifold appellations of that ſuppoſed Deity, what ever it was, which they intended to worſhip. Now their Gods being very many in number, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93253:10"/>
every one having ſeverall titles and appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; no wonder if their worſhippers, moſt of them (for ſome did not, and were accounted very religious for it) needed theſe <hi>Monitores,</hi> or <hi>Nomenclatores,</hi> at their elbows.</p>
               <p>The next proofe or objection (which you wil) is out of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>And before this in that famous place of</hi> Iuſt.

               <p>No man can otherwiſe imagine, but that his intention in this allegation is, to infer out of theſe words, <hi>according to his ability,</hi> conceived prayer, in oppoſition to ſet or preſcribed pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

               <p>His third and laſt objection is out of <hi>Euſebius</hi> concerning <hi>Conſtant.</hi> in theſe words: <hi>And bleſſed</hi> Conſtantine <hi>was herein as unhappy as we, who needed not have compoſed forms of prayer for his Guard, to uſe upon the Lords day, but might and would have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of former Liturgies, if there had been any,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, that I do not (nor perchance any other) underſtand what is the ſtrength of this inference: A peculiar certain prayer was made by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> (a moſt devout and religious Prince) to be uſed by his guard; therefore there was no common <hi>Liturgie-book</hi> extant in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> days, for the uſe of the publike. I have read three Prayers made (they are printed under her name, I am ſure, as <hi>made</hi> by her:) by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of ever bleſſed and glorious memory, <hi>for the ſucceſſe of her Navy,</hi> &amp;c. Would the inference be good upon this, either that there was no <hi>Book of common Prayers</hi> then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and uſed; or that the Queene had no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, or Chaplains, at that time, that might have ſaved her that labour? This I think, might
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93253:11"/>
ſuffice; there having been enough ſaid before, concerning formes of publike prayers, extant and uſed long before the times of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi> And indeed, the <hi>Truth</hi> is all that I ayme at, and not any bodies ſhame. But why ſhould I ſpare him, that hath not ſpared his Mother; and who doth ſo lightly eſteeme of thoſe things, which I do, (and ever ſhall, I hope, as long as I breath, however the times goe) moſt honour and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? Let us therefore looke into <hi>Euſebius</hi> a little more exactly, that it may the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, how this man hath dealt with his Reader.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, whereas hee tels us of Prayers compoſed by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> himſelfe, I ſay it is more then doth appeare by <hi>Euſebius.</hi> Where the Latine hath it, <hi>cap.</hi> 18. <hi>Preces ab Imperatore deſcriptas</hi>: it is in the originall Greek, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, <hi>Such as the Emperour did moſt affect</hi>; and therefore <hi>deſcriptas</hi> here, muſt be, not, <hi>written,</hi> or, <hi>compoſed</hi>; but, <hi>ſelected.</hi> Again, where the Latine hath it, <hi>cap.</hi> 19. <hi>Formulam ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro precandi ipſe militibus praeſcripſit,</hi> &amp;c. it is in the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: that is, <hi>he taught it to all his ſouldiers.</hi> And I hope if a man be ſaid or reported to teach children or ignorant people the <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> or <hi>Creed</hi>; he muſt not therefore of neceſſity be conceived to be the Authour of either.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas hee ſaith, it was for his Guard, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> compoſed theſe forms of Prayers, to uſe upon the Lords day; I ſay, it was not for his Guard, but for all his Souldiers in generall, and eſpecially for them that were
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93253:12"/>
not Chriſtians, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> either made himſelfe, or cauſed to be made, that Prayer which <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſpeaks of, and ſetteth downe in his twentieth Chapter: that being the only Prayer, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> can, in any probability, (ſo farre as appears by <hi>Euſebius</hi>) be conceived, to have compoſed, if he compoſed any. For, as for the Guard that lived within his Palace, to them were appointed, ſaith <hi>Euſebius,</hi> thoſe Prayers which he cals, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And as concerning the Souldiers, whereof <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſays ſome were Chriſtians, and ſome were not; thoſe that were Chriſtians, hee commanded them (diſpenſing with them for their ordinary ſervice, or attendance, upon that day) to repair to publike Churches, and there to celebrate the day: thoſe that were not, even them hee compelled to meet together in the fields upon that day, and there to prayſe God in that form of Prayer which is recited by <hi>Euſebius.</hi> The Prayer was this: <hi>Te ſolum Deum agnoſcimus: te Regem profitemur: te adjutorem invocamus: per te victorias conſequuti ſumus: per te hoſtes ſuperavimus: abs te &amp; praeſentem foelicitatem conſequutos fate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, &amp; futuram (future,</hi> that is, for the time to come, as is more plainly expreſſed by the Greek:) <hi>adepturos ſperamus: tui omnes ſupplices ſumus: abs te petimus, ut</hi> Conſtantinum <hi>Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem noſtrum, una cumpiis ejus liberis, quam diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſsimè nobis ſalvum &amp; victorem conſerves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here you ſee is no mention of Chriſt at all, nothing but might very well be ſaid by a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of thoſe times, as may appeare by divers
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93253:12"/>
of their Prayers yet extant, the firſt words, <hi>Ye ſolum Deum agnoſcimus,</hi> excepted, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe might bear a very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modious interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, according to the tenets of divers of their own Philoſophers and Wiſe men. If any ſhall preſſe the words, <hi>Omnibus militibus praeſcripſit,</hi> to ſhew that it was common to all, whether Chriſtian or Heathen Souldiers, I ſhall not ſtand upon that, it being likely enough, that the ſame Prayer upon other dayes was to be uſed by them all, when they were mixed together, and therefore of purpoſe ſo compoſed, that it might be uſed by any, whether Chriſtians, or Heathens of thoſe times. But in the mean time if it be granted, (as I doe not ſee how it can be denied) that it was principally intended for the uſe of the Heathen Souldiers; how can it be conceived, that ſuch a forme ſhould be ſound in a <hi>Book of common Prayers</hi> appointed for the uſe of Chriſtians; how much leſſe inferred from hence, (as this man would gladly) that the Chriſtians of thoſe days had no <hi>Book of common Prayers</hi>? But I have not done with him yet. I think it wil eaſily be granted unto me, by what hath been ſaid hitherto, that it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that this man in theſe his allegations out of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> tooke more notice of the Latine, then of the Greek. Now if you look upon the Latine, in the Chapter juſt before, (to wit the 17) you ſhall finde that plainly contradicted, which this man would have inferred out of the eighteenth. The words (becauſe it is but a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93253:13"/>
ſhort Chapter) are theſe, <hi>Cap.</hi> 17. <hi>Sed his qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem multa magnificentiora contemplari potes, ſi ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvertas quemadmodum in ipſis Regiis Eccleſiae Dei formam inſtituerit, populo in Eccleſia congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, ipſe ſtudioſe exordiens. Sumptis enim in manus libris, vel ſacrarum literarum contemplationi diligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter animum adhibebat, vel conſtitutas cum univerſo Eccleſiae coetu preces reddebat.</hi> What ſence can any man in the World make of theſe words, but that it was <hi>Conſtantine</hi> his cuſtome, taking the books themſelves into his owne hands, ſomtimes to turne the Holy Scriptures, &amp; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Book of common</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is the word in <hi>Euſebius) Prayers,</hi> according as the Order of the Liturgy by him there and then uſed, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? Now if any man ſhall aske mee, for his owne ſatisfaction, how it is in the originall Greeke, I will ingenuouſly confeſſe that the Greek doth not ſo fully and diſtinctly expreſſe it, as the Latine doth; though it be as true, that the Latine ſaith no more, then what the Greek will very well beare.</p>
               <p>And now I have done with this Author; with whom I ſhould not have had to do at all, but that he came ſo croſſe in my way in this point of <hi>ſet forms of Prayers.</hi> Whether he, or I, be in the right, I ſhall willingly ſubmit to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any that are truly indifferent; that is, that ſeek the truth for it ſelfe, and imbrace it, where ever they find it; not blindly zealous to maintaine their own ſide, whether it be in a juſt cauſe or not. If it ſhal appear to others (as hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it doth unto me) that this man (as confident a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93253:13"/>
man in his way of writing, as ever I met with) is much miſtaken in this point; then I ſhall yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leave him, adviſe others, whoſoever ſhall happen to read this, to pauſe awhile &amp; conſider with themſelves:</p>
               <p>Much talke there is of a Reformation; and for my part, how hee can be accounted a true Chriſtian, that would not be heartily glad to ſee that amended, what ever it be, which, to the prejudice of Gods Glory, is amiſſe, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance not to be amended, without his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar loſſe and prejudice in worldly reſpects, I know not. Now then, if that Reformation, ſo much talked of every where, and by many ſo much deſired, ſhall go on, how farre ſuch men as he, ſo confident, and ſo apt to miſtake, may, either to direct or to informe, bee truſted with it, to the glory of that God, which is the God of Truth; &amp; to the content of men truly zealous, that is, zealous <hi>according to knowledge</hi>; this is the thing, (and God is my witneſſe I have no end in it but his glory:) that I would deſire all men ſeriouſly to conſider of.
