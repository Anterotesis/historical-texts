            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Modeſt Vindication of the Petition of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal for the calling of a Free Paliament.</head>
            <p>THis Defence is grounded upon three fundamental principles; I. <hi>The Right of Petitioning.</hi> II. <hi>The Neceſſity.</hi> III. The <hi>Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>I. It is the undoubted Right of the Subjects to Petition, being founded upon an Act of Parliament, and the higheſt reaſon in the world; for that is a very monſtrous government, where the People muſt not approach their King, and acquaint him with their grievances. The people have the greateſt property in the Land, and therefore the moſt concern'd when a Foreign Enemy is upon it; their welfare is the ſupream Law; and yet they muſt not deſire to meet in order to conſult their own preſervation. The Jeſuits (the ſworn enemies to the Engliſh Nation) will take care of us, and our poſterity; therefore why ſhould we trouble our ſelves at this juncture? They can levy mony with a Proclamation, they can diſpenſe with all Laws, and what ſhould we do with a Parliament, when the whole Statute-Book ſerves for no other end but to wipe the Tayles of theſe Reverend <hi>Satyres</hi>; who fly into their Dens and Thickets, at the very ſound of a Houſe of <hi>Commons.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. The neceſſity, and that an indiſpenſable one: The Government turn'd <hi>Topſie Turvy,</hi> no Law, no Rule, all in a ſtate of War; all Treaties broken, all Obligations ceas'd; and yet the <hi>People</hi> muſt not come together to know why or wherefore they fight, or how they may avoid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying one another; they muſt hack and cut one another to pieces blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and to no other end, but to ſave the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and the <hi>Knaves,</hi> and to ruin themſelves: But the moſt Reverend <hi>Biſhops</hi> are told, that they ſhall have a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> as ſoon as ever the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> has quitted this Realm; that is, ſuch a <hi>Free Parliament</hi> as they were like to have had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Prince</hi> came hither, ſhuffl'd, cut, and pack't by Mr. <hi>Brent</hi> and his <hi>Miſſionaries,</hi> or perhaps ten times worſe, or rather none at all; for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is grown ſuch an infamous <hi>Bankrupt,</hi> that no body will truſt her further than they can command her: She may be compar'd to the <hi>Tyger,</hi> which fawns, ſneaks, and lurks as long as the Hunter is arm'd with his Spear and his Gun, but when once the Weapons are laid down, the <hi>Beaſt</hi> flies upon the unwary Foreſter, tears, and devours him.</item>
               <item>III. The Duty: For what better Office could thoſe pious <hi>Prelats</hi> and <hi>Patriots</hi> of their Country do for the publick Good, than to make all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Friends, to ſave the lives of many Thouſands, and to heal all our Wounds and Sores, which they of the <hi>Roman Faith</hi> have inflicted upon a <hi>People</hi> too kind and good natur'd for ſuch ravenous <hi>Monſters,</hi> who go about ſeeking whom they may devour. <hi>France, Hungary,</hi> and the <hi>Valleys of Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> are ſtill reeking with the blood of their poor innocent <hi>Preys,</hi> and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choing with the lamentations of a <hi>People</hi> ruin'd, by truſting theſe <hi>Crocodiles</hi> too much; and if God in his infinite mercy had not watch'd over theſe Kingdoms, and ſent a <hi>Gabriel</hi> to guard them, they had certainly fallen a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim to the intollerable Pride, the lawleſs Fury, and untractable Barbarity of a ſort of <hi>Animals,</hi> call'd <hi>Catholicks,</hi> ſubtle, and treacherous by cuſtom and diſcipline, not to be chain'd by any Law either of God or Man; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every body knows how <hi>far</hi> we may rely <hi>upon them,</hi> when the <hi>Arch-Angel</hi> leaves us.
