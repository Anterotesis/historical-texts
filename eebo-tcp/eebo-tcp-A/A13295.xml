         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo things (good Reader) have been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore controverted between Mr. Iohnson and mee, the one concerning the Power of the Christian church, which he would have instal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Ministerie thereof: the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Antichristian church of Rome, with the ministerie and baptisme thereof, which he hath pleaded to be true, though corrupted; I have proved to be false and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceytfull. These things have passed publikly (through mine Opposites occasion) in Mr Richard Cliftons <hi>Advertisement,</hi> and my <hi>Animadversion</hi> therto. The former of these two points, Mr. Iohnson hath left vnanswered; so the prudent may judge of the strife, by that which we both have sayd: the latter, he hath sought to mainteyne by a colourable Plea for the Romane church, cheifly underpropped by two reasons, 1. because Antichrist should <hi>sit in the Temple of God; 2.</hi> and because Apostate Israel (the figure of this Antichristian church,) was the church of God; as he pretendeth. These, with his other like reasons, I have laboured to refell, in this treatise folowing. His order of handling them, I have altered; beginning with the Church of Rome; then with the Baptisme of that church: for so I judge the trueth of the controversie wil soonest appeare. His often longsome repetitions, I seek to abridge; as being fruitlesse, &amp; wearisome to the Readers: his bold and bitter taunts, I passe over; being not willing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer any man (and least of all the dead,) to such things. As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so his marching us among the Anabaptists, for our more disgrace: his dissembling of his own former judgment and accord with us, in the things now controverted; imputing them to us and others, when himself hath formerly spoken and written for the things
<pb facs="tcp:23010:3"/>
which he now would pull down; but hath not taken away his owne grounds. Onely wheras in his preface he intimateth <hi>sundry ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest untruthes</hi> published in the Animadversion, but nameth none: I signifie in a good conscience, that to my knowledge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished not any one untrueth, but rather spared him, then pressed things in extremitie. That which I suppose he aimeth at, I set downe from the report of honest faithfull witnesses, (of whome some are now at rest in the Lord,) who would not (as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded) willingly have related any thing but the trueth. Finally, as in all other my labours, so in these controversies following, I indevour to find out &amp; manifest the way and wil of God, by the light of his word; to the glorie of his name, and comfort of those that love the trueth in sinceritie.</p>

               <p>MIne opposite pleadeth thus; 1. <hi>First, J take an argument from the baptisme had in the churches aforesayd, [the Apostate churches of Christians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] thus. The Baptisme had in the church of Rome, is the Lords baptisme, the signe and seale of his covenant, the ordinance of God had in that church from the Apostles times (before Antichrist there arose) Rom. 6. 2. 3. and so is true baptisme, which is from heaven and not of men: that one baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me which perteyneth to the bodie of Christ, Eph. 4. 4. 5. which the Lord hath given to his church, and not man &amp;c. Therfore the church of Rome, is the church of God, and under his covenant &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. Here, let it first be observed, whether mine opposite plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>against the present estate of that church,</hi> as before he pretended. For if they be under Gods covenant, &amp; have it sealed unto them from heaven, by that one true baptisme, then are they in the state of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23010:5"/>
grace and of salvation: which is the very thing that all Papists at this day doe plead for. Concerning his Argument, I deny, that the baptisme had in all Apostate churches of Christians and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the church of Rome, is the Lords true baptisme, or the signe and seale of his covenant of grace unto them. Here mine opposite referreth me to an other place of his book, for proof of the trueth of their Baptisme: wherto I will make answer anone, in their place. And now that my denyal may not be so bare as is his assertion here: I will insist upon the two scriptures which he citeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and disprove their baptisme.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Rom. 6. 2. 3. 4.</hi> the Apostle sayth; <hi>How shall we that are dead to syn, live any longer therin? Know ye not that so many of us as are baptised in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ Iesus, were baptised into his death?

                  <hi>alive</hi> unto God. But Antichristians (such as are the professant members of the church of Rome,) are not dead unto, or freed from syn: for they are the subjects of the <note n="†" place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 3.</note> Man of syn, the worshipers of the Beast, for whom is prepared <hi>the wine of the wrath of God, Revel. 14. 9. 10.</hi> They are of that church, which by my opposites confession a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before) is <hi>fallen into most synfull and deep apostasie, &amp; is a notorious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arlot and idolatress, which all the people of God ought to forsake:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are rather to be counted <hi>dead in synns</hi> (as th'Apostle speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the Gentiles, <hi>Ephes. 2. 1.</hi>) and that they are in deed dead, and not partakers of the first resurrection; is evident by <hi>Revel. 20. 4. 5. 6.</hi> in that they are the worshipers of the Beast, and murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the witnesses of Iesus. Wherfore, the doctrine of Baptisme in <hi>Rom. 6.</hi> is farr from proving the Antichristians or other hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and apostate churches, to have the true baptisme of Christ, or seale of his covenant: but his servants they are to whom they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, even of syn unto death, <hi>Rom. 6. 16.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other scripture is <hi>Ephe. 4. 4. 5.</hi> There is <hi>one body and one spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, even as ye are called unto one hope of your calling: one Lord, one faith, one baptisme.</hi> By which words it appeareth, that such as have the <hi>One baptisme,</hi> have also one and the same <hi>faith, Lord, hope, spirit,</hi> and <hi>body:</hi> which to affirme of the Antichristian church of Rome, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23010:6"/>
of all other heretical and Apostate churches that professe Christ, is very impious. And most firme arguments there are from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles words to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary of that which this man pleadeth for. As, The Romish and other heretical churches have not the one &amp; same faith with the true Churches of Christ; witness, their blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous doctrines published by the Council of Trent, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther books; and the Apostles prophesie, that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted <hi>from the faith, 1 Tim. 4. 1. &amp;c.</hi> therfore they have not the one Baptisme. They have not one and the same Lord Iesus Christ; but have Antichrist the Man of syn, for their Lord: therefore they have not the one baptisme. They have not that one hope, nor that one Spirit, neyther are they one bodie with the true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an churches: therfore they have not that one baptisme. These things are partly prooved before in the description which I set downe of Antichrists church: they are also acknowledged of all Christian churches, which disclaim the unitie with the Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in their faith, spirit, &amp; bodie. And the scriptures most abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly disclaime this feighned unitie: as <hi>2 Cor. 6. 12. what concord hath Christ with Belial?</hi> meaning, none at all. And Belial is there put for Antichrist and his retinue, as in <hi>2 Sam. 23. 6.</hi> &amp; <hi>22. 5.</hi> The Apostle sheweth, that the Antichristians have from God, strong delusions, to beleeve lyes unto their damnation, <hi>2 Thes. 2. 11. 12.</hi> That they are departed from the faith, doe give heed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Tim. 4. 1. 2.</hi> That the false teachers (among Christians) privily bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction, <hi>2 Pet. 2. 1.</hi> That the Beast (which is the <note n="*" place="margin">Dan. 7. 23.</note> kingdome of Antichrist,) and the false prophet (his ministers) and all that worship him, or take his mark; shalbe tormented in fyre and brimstone for ever and ever, <hi>Rev. 20. 10. &amp;c.</hi> &amp; <hi>14. 9. 10.</hi> And shall we now say, that these mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable creatures, have one Spirit, hope, Lord, faith and baptisme with the saincts and true Churches of Christ?

               </p>
               <p>Answ. I deny the consequence. For then, after Israel was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23010:6"/>
from the Lord, (as is testified in in <hi>Ier. 3. 8.</hi>) there was no salvation for any among them: which I know mine opposite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self would not say.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Objection. Why, <note n="*" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> out of the covenant of God, there is no salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. I grant it. But though the church be not under the covenant of God, but without it, or divorced from him, yet some parlicular persons in that church, may through Gods grace be in his covenant. For as every true church is in the covenant of God, yet some hypocrites and reprobates are in the same, which perish for ever: so every false church is out of the covenant; yet some truly faithful and elect may be therein, which by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace may be saved. Example in Rahab the Canaanitess, the church whereof shee was, had not the covenant of grace in Christ: yet she having heard of Gods works towards Israel, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in God, and was saved; and before she joyned her self to the church of Israel, shee shewed the fruits of true and living faith, wherby shee was justified, &amp; is put in the catalogue of the Saincts, <hi>Jos. 2. 1. 9. 10. &amp;c. Heb. 11. 31. 39. Jam. 2. 25. 26.</hi> The like is to be thought of the other nations, farr off from God, who by some meanes hearing of his name and trueth, might imbrace the faith unto salvation, though the churches wherof they stood members were false and idolatrous, <hi>1 King. 8. 41. 42. 43.</hi> So where mine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid. p. 128</note> bringeth scriptures to prove, that they which are not in the covenant of God and Christ, cannot be saved: he proveth that which is not denyed: but this he should have proved, if he could; that if a church be false, and not under the covenant; none in that church can by any meanes come unto the faith and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Christ; for this I deny. And his argument if it had been sound, should have been this. If Antichristian churches be not under the covenant of God, but divorced from the Lord; then is there no salvation for any that are under the covenant of that church, and in no other covenant: and so I would have granted his argument; as confirmed by the Holy ghost, that all such are in the state of damnation, <hi>2 Thes. 2. 10. 11. 12. Rev. 14. 9. 10.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I answer, First for the persons that set downe this profession they are by the testimony of God that <hi>false prophet,</hi> which with the Beast shalbe torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted for ever &amp; ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 10. or at least, they are those <hi>uncleane spirits</hi> which come out of the mouth of the Beast &amp; of the False prophet, <hi>for they are the spirits of Divils, working miracles, which goe forth unto the Kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to gather them to the battel of that great day of God almighty, Rev.</hi> 16. 13. 14. And this is apparant by that corrupt Testament and blasphemous notes and interpretations upon it, which they there set forth to the world, in sted of the true Christian and catholik faith. Moreover they are a part of the popish hierarchie which mine opposite after maketh to be the <hi>Man of syn, the son of perdition,</hi> and <hi>the Beast,</hi> which hee will not indure to heare that they should be accounted the church, or maried to Christ: yet here he maketh them the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the doctrine of salvation. Secondly for the Profession which they there make, if it were sound and good, yet denying it againe in their works, it nothing availeth them: for of such it is written, <hi>They professe that they know God, but in works they deny him, being abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate; Tit.</hi> 1. 16. But what shal we say, if they deny the trueth of the doctrine of Christ, not in work onely, but even in word and profession? First then, (to omitt their rayling against Calvin about the Godhead of Christ being of himself, in their <hi>Annot.</hi> on <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>sect.</hi> 3.) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Christs manhood, and the trueth of his humane nature, how ever they acknowledge him to have taken flesh of the virgin; yet beleeve they, (and burne to ashes such as wil not beleeve it,) that the bread in the sacrament is transsubstantiated into the very body of Christ; so they have a Christ made of a wafer cake; a Christ whose whole bodie is in an hundred thousand places and moe at once, even in all places of the world, whersoever Masse is sayd by a Preist: so he must have a fanatical bodie, which can neyther be seen, felt, tasted or by any sense of man perceived as an humane bodie: &amp; this breaden Christ they worship in that their idolatrous sacrament, and doe eat him really &amp; properly with their mouthes. And doe these now beleeve Christs humane nature aright; when as

               </p>
               <p>Answ. If it be in defense of the Christian faith, it is well: but if acknowledging Iesus to be the Christ, they dye also in defense of the Antichristian faith professed by that church, and for the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie of the same, (which is hatefull to the very Turks:) then I say with th'Apostle, they may <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 3.</note> give their body to be burned, and it profit them nothing. Neyther doubt I, but some of the Iewes, have dyed and will dye in defense of the God of Israel as they now profess him from Moses and the Prophets; rather then yeeld to the heathens. But the extraordinary mercie of God to some in Antichrists church, justifieth no more the estate of that Synagogue of Satan, then his like extraordinary mercie to some of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens (of whom we shall speak anone) wil justifie the heathens sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues to be Gods true churches.

church on earth. If he speak not of a particular visible church, but of the Vniversal church which is invisible, and comprehendeth all Gods elect: he swerveth from the question, and deceiveth by aequivocation; for we treat of the visible church of Rome, whether it be Christs true church or no. As for the Vniversal church, which is all over the earth, and from the beginning of the world to the end therof, and conteyneth Gods elect onely: out of it in deed there is no salvation. But what is this to the purpose? For so a man might reason thus. In the church there are no reprobates, there is no damnation; for Christ giveth all his sheep eternal life, and they shal never perish, Ioh. 10. 28. But the Popish synagogue, is (by mine oposites plea) the church, even the true church of Christ. Therfore in it there are no reprobates, there is no damnation. Here (I doubt not) mine opposite would distinguish between the Catholik or universall church in the first proposition, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular church of Rome, in the second; and so deny the argument: &amp; why would he then himself obtrude upon us, such a deceitfull reason?</p>
               <p>The latter part of his speech I grant: but it helpeth him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For the synagogue of Antichrist, is none of Gods consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, though every true Christian church is: neyther hath he annexed promise of grace, to his ordinances abused by the man of syn, and his subjects, in that malignant church, but hath threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the destruction of the deceivers and deceived, <hi>2 Thes. 2. 8. 10. 11. 12.</hi>

                  </note> reason for the church of Rome consisteth of a division of the world into <hi>Christians, Iewes, Turks and Pagans;</hi> and of a question, <hi>if it be asked, which of these is the Church of God at this day? should we not answer, the Christians: and among the Christians, comprise the churches aforesayd, for the reasons before specified?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. The first part of his answer, I yeild unto, that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans now are Gods church. The second I deny, namely that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christians (such as the Papists be,) &amp; other heretical and apostate churches, are to be comprised in the number; save in name onely, for in deed and trueth they are not. His <hi>reasons before specified,</hi> I have particularly refuted: &amp; so might here end. But further to explaine the trueth, I answer; that after this general division, we must make an other subdivision, or els we may be deceived. The subdivision is of Christians againe, into true and false, or into Christians and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23010:10"/>
Antichristians which professe Christ in name &amp; deny him in deed. And this I learne of the holy Ghost, who in the Apostles times di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Iewes into outward, and inward, Rom. 2. 28. 29. and counted these latter onely Iewes: and such as sayd they were Iewes and were not, but did lye, he calleth them <hi>the Synagogue of Satan: Revel. 3. 9.</hi> Even so, he prophesied of a <hi>Beast</hi> (or kingdom) which should have <hi>two hornes like the Lamb</hi> (Christ, and so be called Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians) but should <hi>speak as the Dragon,</hi> work wonders, &amp; deceive men that dwell on the earth, &amp;c, <hi>Revel. 13. 11. 13. 14.</hi> He also foretold of <hi>false teachers among</hi> Christians, who privily should bring in <hi>damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them &amp;c. 2 Pet. 2. 1.</hi> If thus we distinguish not between the true Christ and <note n="*" place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>false Christs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween true prophets and <hi>false prophets,</hi> and so between true church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and false: we may reteyn the name of Christ and Christian churches, and be in deed nothing less. And according to mine opposites manner of plea, an other might reason thus, Of synners in the world, some are <note n="†" place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 4. 5.</note> Angels, and some are men. If then the question be asked, seing Christ came to save synners, <hi>1 Tim. 1. 15.</hi> which of these are redemed and saved by Christ, &amp; are the church of God? should we not answer <hi>men;</hi> and among men also comprise all peoples upon earth, Iewes, Turks Pagans &amp;c. This is the mould of mine Opposers argument; and as colourably as he pleadeth for Antichrists synagogue to be Christs Church, so others doe plead for universal redemption of all peoples &amp; persons borne into the world; from <hi>Ioh. 1. 9. Rom. 5. 18.</hi> and other like scriptures.</p>
               <p>4 The <note n="*" place="margin">Chr. plea, p. 123,</note> fourth reason is from baptisme, a visible signe of Gods visible Church among Christians, as circumcision was among the Iewes &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I answer, the baptisme among Antichristians is in deed like their church; Christs in name, but not in deed and trueth. As for that which he annexeth, of our defending and reteyning that visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble baptisme received in the church of Rome; it foloweth after to be discussed, when we come to treat of their baptisme. In the mean while, let it be observed, that as Circumcision was a signe of the Church of old; so was sacrificing, both then, and before Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was instituted: and all nations reteyning sacrifice then, as well as Antichrist reteyneth baptisme &amp; the Lords supper now; it wil also folow by like reason, that all nations were then Gods churches; which argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t shal be prosecuted hereafter. Againe, as the

               <p>5 The 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reason <note n="†" place="margin">Ibidem</note> is from the defection of Iudah and Israel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning stil Gods people notwithstanding: therfore also the church of Rome, in like manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Of the first part of this reason, touching the state of the Israelites, we are after to speak in particular: but were it gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I deny the consequence, it foloweth not, the Antichristian synagogue is so also.</p>
               <p>Inst. <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 123. 124.</note> The consequence (sayth he) is prooved, because these were types of the like state of the Christian churches, recorded for our instruction. <hi>1 Cor. 10. 6.—11.</hi> with <hi>Rom. 154. &amp; 2 Tim. 3. 16. 17. 2 Pet. 2. 1. Jude v. 5. 11. Rev. 2. 14. 20. &amp; 11. 2. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. I grant that he sayth, for the Christian churches: but for the Antichristian, it is true in part onely. The synns of Iudah and Israel, are found in Rome: so are the synns of Sodome, Aegypt, Babylon, and heathen Rome; which by warrant from God, were types also of this Antichristian Babylon, Rev. 11. 8. and 17. 5. From which I may as truly conclude; Sodome, Aegypt and Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon of old, were so farr fallen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, as they were not his chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or peoples: and they were types of this church of Antichrist, and the things written of them, are for our instruction, Rom. 15. 4. Iude v. 7. 2. Pet. 2. 5. 6. Therfore this Antichristian synagogue, is not Christs true church.</p>
               <p>Further I answer, that the types which were in Israel, prove not that the things typed are in the same degree of good or evil, neyther more nor less; as mine opposite would inferr that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christians are not now more deep in apostasie then were the Israel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites. For types and figures agree in some things, but not in all. Moses, Aaron, David and all other types of Christ were synners: but it were wicked therupon to conclude, that Christ himself was a synner. Moreover Christs Preisthood was figured in Aaron &amp; his so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ns: yet did not that Levitical Preisthood fully type out his office, but in part: &amp; a more complete figure of him was in Melchisedek, as th'Apostle sheweth in Heb. 5. and 7. chapters. Accordingly,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23010:11"/>
it wil follow, that Antichrist is answerable to Israels apostasie in part: and yet a more complete figure of him is to be found in the Gentiles. And as Christ excelleth in holynes all that were types of him: so Antichrist exceedeth in wickednes all the types of him; &amp; therfore hath many sorts of wicked men, to resemble his impietie. Rev. 11. 8. And that his consequence followeth not from the type to the thing typed, that they are both in an equal estate, appeareth further by his own grant (in pag. 126.), where he maketh <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> and his captaines &amp;c. a type of the Papacie. Now it is confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of all, that Antiochus and his companie were Pagans in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: so by the like reason, the Pope with his captaines and sould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jers, must be Pagans also.</p>
               <p>6. The 6 reason <note n="†" place="margin">pag. 124.</note> alleaged for them is, that it should be syn for Papists and Apostate Christians, to marie with Pagans, to neglect baptisme, not to sanctifie the Lords day; as it was in Iudah and Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael to marie with the heathen, to neglect circumcision, to profane the Lords day &amp;c. Dan. 11. 32. with 1. Maccab. 1. 16. 45. 51. 55. and with Mal. 2. 11. Ezr. 9. 1. 2. &amp; 10. 10. Neh. 13. 3. 23.—27. Hos. 5. 7. &amp; 7. 8. &amp; 8. 12.

For Pagans, and such as perteyn not to the Lords covenant, being not his church and people, are not in their estate bound to these and the like ordinances of the Lord, which he hath given to his church and people. <hi>Psal. 147. 19. 20.</hi> with <hi>Deut. 7. 1.—11.</hi>

Of Pagans he sayth, they are not <hi>in their estate</hi> bound &amp;c: but Papists and apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Israelites, he would have them bound, yet mentioneth not <hi>their estate:</hi> wheras if he speak not of them also <hi>in their estate,</hi> his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is false and fraudulent.</p>
               <p>2. The scriptures alleaged <hi>Psal. 147. &amp; Deut. 7.</hi> are by him abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, whiles he restreyneth them to <hi>these and the like ordinances,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, mariage, circumcision, baptisme, and the Sabbath; understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by <hi>the like ordinances,</hi> (as I suppose) the Passover and other sacrifices, the Lords supper, &amp;c: whereas the Psalmist speaketh ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of Gods <hi>Words, Statutes</hi> (or <hi>Ordinances</hi>) and <hi>Judgments, Psal. 147. 19. 20.</hi> which three, doe comprehend the moral Law, called the <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 34. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Ten Words,</hi> the Ordinances of worship and service, and the Iudicials for punishment of malefactors: all these the Prophet sayth,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23010:11"/>
were shewed <hi>unto Jsrael,</hi> and God <hi>dealt not so with any nation.</hi> Now to conclude from these words, therfore the nations were not bound to observe <hi>the ordinances,</hi> because God had not shewed them unto them, as he had doen unto Israel (namely by his written Law given at Mount Sinai,) hath no more weight then this, Therfore the nations were not bound to the moral Law, or to the Iudicials; and so synned not in committing idolatrie, murder, whordome, or the like. But this is impious to say, and a false conclusion: therfore his conclusion also touching the ordinances is false, and can not rightly be gathered from this text. The evil of it further appeareth in one of his instances, <hi>the Sabbath day:</hi> which is one of the ten co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, and instituted from the beginning of the world, <hi>Gen. 2.</hi> If then the nations were free from syn when they kept not the Sabbath, because they had it not written in the book of the Law or Tables of stone as had Israel: were they not also by the same reason free from syn in not keeping the other comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
               <p>So for the Lords day now, he maketh the church of Christ onely (and so the Papists and other like whom he accounteth true churches) synners if they keep it not: all others he freeth from syn, as not bound to keep it. Wherupon this paradox followeth, that the further men fall away from Christ, the more free they are from syn. For the church of Rome being fallen to Antichrist the Pope, they are synners in his account, if they keep not the Lords day: but the churches of Corinth, Ephesus and other like which are fallen to Mahomet, they are no synners in his account, though they observe not the Lords day: and why? Onely because they are fallen so farr, as they are no church of God, nor in his covenant of grace. Thus, the further from Christ the freer from syn; if this doctrine be true.</p>
               <p>But I suppose the contrary to be true: and that all peoples how farr soever fallen from Christ, are now bound to keep the Lords day, and other ordinances of Christ; and it is their great syn that they doe not. For Christ sent his Apostles to teach all nations, &amp; to baptise them, and to teach them to observe all things whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he commanded his Apostles, even to the worlds end, <hi>Mat. 28. 19, 20.</hi> And they went into all the world, preaching and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing all men every where to repent, and beleeve the Gospel, &amp; to be baptised, and observe all the ordinances of Christ: and all
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23010:12"/>
that obeyed not, or that have since fallen from their obedience, are guiltie before God, and shalbe condemned, because they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve not in Christ, and keep not his commandements. <hi>Mark. 16. 15. 16.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be sayd that a Turk or Pagan in that their estate of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leef may not lawfully be baptised or admitted to the Lords supper, til they repent: this is true; yet can we not therfore say, they are not bound to be baptised, or are free from synin neglecting baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me: for they are bound to all the doctrines and ordinances of the gospel in order, first to repent and beleeve, then to be baptised, then to receive the Lords supper, and so all the rest. If further it be sayd, that the Papists in their estate of misbeleef and idolatrie; may without repentance and without returning to the true faith, be partakers of baptisme and the Lords supper &amp;c: it is denyed. For if the Iewes (which were the true church though corrupted) might not be received to baptisme without repentance, as the scriptures shew, <hi>Mat. 3. 6. 7.—10. Luk 7. 29. 30. Act. 2. 38.</hi> then the Antichristians, the members of that church which (by Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And wheras mine opposite pleadeth for their right in the sacraments &amp; other ordinances which they should syn to neglect: it would be knowen where they are bound to receive them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their own church, or in some Christian reformed church. If in their owne; then they are bound to heare Mass, and syn if they be not partakers of it; for that is their idolatrous supper: then doe not the Magistrates well to forbidd them their Masses, and other ecclesiastical exercises, which they are bound by God to frequent, and should syn if they used them not. If they have right unto them in other reformed churches: then is there to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion between true Christians and those Antichristians, in one body, at one Table: for (as the Apostle sayth) <hi>wee being many are one bread, and one bodie: for we are all partakers of that one bread, 1 Cor. 10. 17.</hi> But this were to build a new Babylon, and to make a confused mixture of the members of Christ and of Antichrist, contrary to all the scriptures. <hi>2 Cor. 6. 14. 15. 16. 17 Rev. 21. 27.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other scripture which he citeth, <hi>Deut 7. 1 - 11.</hi> helpeth him no more then the former: for there in the 11. verse, the <hi>Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:23010:12"/>
                  <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Judgments</hi> (which imply all Moses law) are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed: if other nations were freed from all these, then were they freed from all law, and so from all syn; for where there is no Law, there is no transgression, seing <hi>Syn is the transgression of the Law: 1. Ioh. 3. 4.</hi> And where he instanceth mariage with Pagans, which is there forbidden <hi>Deut. 7. 3.</hi> and applieth it to Papists now, that they should syn to mary with such, I grant it. But his inference therup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that therfore they are the true church and in the covenant of grace, I deny. For the Iewes at this day, which professe (after their false manner) the God of Israel, and all things written in the Law and Prophets, should syn if now they maried with such, doing contrary to their express Law, <hi>Mal. 2. 11,</hi> Yet are not the Iewes now in the covenant of grace, or the church of God.</p>
               <p>Againe in <hi>Deut. 7. 5.</hi> there is commandment to destroy images and like monuments of idolatrie: if this was peculiar to Israel, then other nations synned not, in suffering idols among them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destroyed: wheras the Apostle plainly sheweth their greivous syn in making and using such idols, <hi>Rom. 1. 23.</hi> and consequently it must needs also be their syn, that they did not forsake, destroy and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish them.</p>
               <p>If any now aske, whether the other nations were then bound to all the ordinances of Israel? I answer, no: for some things were never before commanded, nor unto other then the church of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, as the strangers might eat some meates, which the Israelites might not, <hi>Deut. 14. 21.</hi> Such things having never been forbidden them of God, they might eat without syn, as we may at this day. But this I say of the nations, that all the Lawes, Statutes and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which were once commanded them of God; they were bound for ever to keep, til God againe repealed them. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample all the ten commandements; and such Statutes (or cerimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies) as were taught them of God, as sacrificing, <hi>Gen 4. 3. 4. &amp; 8. 20.</hi> not to eat flesh with the blood, Gen. 9. 4. and all other the like. And for judgments, to kill murderers, <hi>Gen. 9. 6.</hi> and so to punish other malefactors. And no Apostasie could ever free them from syn, in neglecting any of Gods lawes once given them. So no Apostasie could free the Israelites from any law of Moses; or the world now, from the Law of Christ. The Iewes that under Antiochus turned, to Paganisme, <hi>1 Maccab. 1. 43.</hi> were guiltie they and their seed, for neglecting circumcision, the Passover and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23010:13"/>
ordinances of Moses; and their apostasie (wherby they went out from the covenant of God and his church,) freed them not from syn at all. So the Christians in like manner that have Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate to Mahometisme, are nevertheless in their synns for neglect of Christs trueth &amp; ordinances; though they be no Christian church, as all of us graunt.</p>
               <p>Onely there is this difference to be put; that such as know the will of God, (as did the Iewes, and many Papists now may, by the scriptures,) and doe it not; shalbe beaten with many stripes; wheras the ignorant peoples, and Popish multitude, shalbe beaten with few, <hi>Luke.</hi> 12. 47. 48. But to excuse them from syn wholly, is to plead for iniquitie. And for this cause, both David in <hi>Ps.</hi> 147. and Moses in <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. urgeth Israel to thankfullnes and obedience above other peoples, in that the Lord had now written his lawes and ordinances unto them, and made them an holy people, when he left other peoples, onely to that doctrine which by word of mouth was delivered them from Noe and his sonns; which if they did forsake (as they had in a great mesure,) they should perish for ever.</p>

                  </note> reason for the church of Rome is taken from 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 3. 4. Where it is prophesied that Antichrist should sit <hi>in the Temple of God.</hi> This argument he handleth at large. But first let it be observed, how all his reasons, hetherto, are shewed to be insufficient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and built upon weak grounds, the first being taken from their baptisme, which is adulterate as the church it self: The second, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an inconvenience falsly presupposed, that none in that church can else be saved: The third, from a question, whether Christians, Iewes, Turks or Pagans, be the church. The 4. is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine from their baptisme. The 5. is from the types of Iudah and Israel in apostasie. The 6. is from a supposed freedome that such as are apostate from the covenant of God, should have from syn, if they neglect the ordinances of the gospel. None of these argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are taken from the essential things wherof the true church consisteth; none from the matter, to prove them saincts; or forme, to prove them united unto Christ and one to an other, according to the order of his testament; none from the faith, to shew it to be true; or from the worship and service of God; or from the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to manifest eyther of these to be according to Christ. And now, the last of his reasons is from a figurative phrase <hi>the Temple</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:23010:13"/>
                  <hi>of God,</hi> which may be diversly understood and applied, as himself cannot deny. Let the prudent reader judge, whether these his seven arguments be any thing like those <hi>seven pillars,</hi> which Wisdome hewed out, when she builded her house, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 1.</p>
               <p>Now let us weigh, his seventh reason. <hi>The Apostle</hi> (sayth he) <hi>speaking of Antichrist, in</hi> 2 <hi>Thes</hi> 2. 3. 4. <hi>describeth him thus; There shall come an Apostasie</hi> (<hi>defection or falling away</hi>) <hi>and the man of syn shalbe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped: so that he as God, suteth in the Temple of God, shewing himself that he is God &amp;c. Here the Apostle describing Antichrist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> speaketh of the Temple of God, where he suteth &amp;c. Now that by the Temple of God in Jsrael, was figured the church of God among Christians, appeareth by these scriptures,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16. 17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>and is acknowledged by the best writers of all ages &amp;c. So then from this scripture J reason as followeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jf the Pope of Rome with his hierarchie be the man of syn (here spoken of) and the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped: then is the church of Rome the Temple of God here spoken of; wherein he suteth as God, shewing himselfe that hee is God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Pope of Rome with his hierarchie, is (by</hi>

                  <hi>their owne grant) the man of syn of whom the Apostle here speaketh &amp;c. Therfore the church of Rome, is the Temple of God also, that here is spoken of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer. This argument I might wholly grant, and not hurt the cause I plead for. For though the church of Rome be the Temple of God, which Paul speaketh of: yet followeth it not, that it is Gods true Temple, or true Church, (which is the point that should be concluded;) seing the scriptures often speak of things as once they were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though so they continue not still: as also, they speak of things according to the outward pretense and shew that is made of them; though in deed and trueth they be nothing less. The first is manifest by these and other like instances: Abigail is called <hi>the wife of Nabal,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 5. though Nabal was then dead, and his wife maried to David. Simon is still called <hi>the Leper, Mat.</hi> 26. 6. though he was then clensed of his leprosie. The king of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus an heathen man that lived in Ezekiels dayes, is sayd to have been <hi>in Eden the garden of God,</hi> to have been <hi>upon the holy mountaine of God,</hi> and to have <hi>walked in the middest of the stones of fyre, Ezek.</hi> 28. 13. 14.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23010:14"/>
meaning that he had been in Gods church, on mount Sion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people of God: although not he himself, but Huram his predecessor (many yeres before, in the dayes of David and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon) was the man that became a proselyte in Israel, and helped to build the Temple; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. 3.—16. even as if a man should speak to the Bishop of Rome at this day, and tell him what he was for a Bishop in th'Apostles dayes, and how now he is degenerate and become the man of syn. The mountaines of Horeb and Tabor, where God once gave his Law and Christ was transfigured; are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter still called the <hi>mount of God,</hi> and <hi>the Holy mount,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And when these titles are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, it is not to justifie them at all, but to aggravate their syn. So for the second, that things are called according to the outward appearance and pretext set upon them, though they be in deed false; is evident by these and the like examples; false Gods, which are but idols, are called gods, usually: so one Prophet calleth those the Philistians <hi>gods,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. 12. which an other calleth their <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 21.

Which should carefully be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by the due consideration of the scriptures, with the circumstances ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and by the conference of other places of scripture, and the proportion of fayth layd togither. Which whiles the Anabaptists neglict, they look on the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture partially, and press the letter extreamly, without consideration of the true and right meaning therof.</hi> These words of his are true; the more it is to be lamented that he himself would so press the letter against me, and not weigh the meaning of the same, by it self, and other scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the proportion of fayth layd togither.</p>
               <p>In alleaging this text, he layeth downe the words thus, <hi>There shal come an apostasie</hi> (or <hi>falling away</hi>): wheras the Apostle sayth, <hi>except there come an apostasie</hi> (or <hi>falling-away</hi>) <hi>first:</hi> which word <hi>first,</hi> may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate that the church should fall away from the love of the trueth, before the man of syn should be revealed: and this is apparant by the 10. verse, where the people whom Antichrist seduceth, are sayd to be <hi>them that perish; because they received not the love of the trueth, that they might be saved.</hi> Or, if the word <hi>first</hi> (which mine opposite lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth out,) be understood before Christs coming, then is it meant of <hi>the apostasie</hi> (or <hi>the falling. away,</hi>) so called by an excellencie, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding all other. And is not to be referred to Antichrist the head onely, but to Antichristians the bodie also; who after other synns, should fall away with Antichrist, and be damned with him; as in the 11. verse it is sayd, <hi>God shall send them strong delusion, that they should beleeve a lye; shat they all might be damned who beleeve not the trueth, but had pleasure in unrighteousnes.</hi> So that by the whole scope of this scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is evident, the Apostle divideth not the people of the church of Rome, from the Bishop and ministers of the same; as if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should be Gods true Temple, Christs true Church, under his covenant, and so in the state of grace; when the Bishops and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters are the Divils Temple, Antichrist, the man of syn, and so in the state of damnation: but maketh both bishops and people, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers and deceived, all of them under wrath and condemnation; otherweise then my opposite would perswade.

                  <hi>this terme</hi> [<hi>the church of Rome</hi>] <hi>is taken eyther particularly</hi> (which he applieth to <hi>the Laterane church in Rome,</hi> the Popes <hi>parish church:</hi>) or <hi>more generally, for all other such Christian churches; as are come under the Popes jurisdiction</hi> &amp;c. This later I hold to be most proper here: for what needed there such warning to the Thessalonians &amp; other christian churches through the world, if a Bishop of the Lateran parish (a corner in Rome) had exalted himself above God therin onely; and had not usurped also a pretended Christian power over all? And the complement of the prophesie, is an evident exposition of it: for who knoweth not, that the Pope scorneth to be Bishop of the Lateran parish onely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is a jurisdiction over the catholik church throughout the earth, which he chalengeth. And now what proof bringeth mine oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, that the church of Rome as God constituted it, is <hi>taken gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally for other Christian churches under the Popes jurisdiction?</hi> None at
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23010:16"/>
all: neyther can he bring any jote of Gods word for the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Againe what proof maketh he, that the catholik Romane church wherin the Pope sitteth, is the true church of God? None but this, <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 152.</note> 
                  <hi>J suppose these men themselves being better advised, wil not deny them to be the churches and Temple of God.</hi> But he should have shewed (if it had been possible for him) that the Romane church is by divine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution the catholik or universal church: which because I assure my self it can never be doen, I conclude that this Romane catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik church is a fiction of the Popes braine, and a meere idol like himself: and is no otherweise <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> then the Pope is Christs universal vicar; namely in lying words and vaine ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And so the maine ground for <hi>the Temple of God</hi> wherin Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ sitteth, to be the true church of Christ, is overthrowne.</p>
               <p>As for the Popes Laterane parish, I both deny it to be Christs true church; and that it onely is the Temple of God wherin Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ should sit. His proof of the former is this. <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 150.</note> 
                  <hi>Jf we understand it of a particular church, (as the Apostle wrote his epistle to the church of the Romans) how shall we soundly deny it eyther to be the Temple of God, or Antichrist to be set therin?</hi> Thus have we suppositions and questions, in sted of proofes. To his demand I answer: it is the Temple of God in pretence, not in trueth; even as the Pope is a bishop of Christ in pretence, but in deed is Antichrist the man of syn, as mine opposite granteth. The church that was in Rome in Pauls time, wil no more justifie the Popes synagogue there now; then the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ministers which were then in that church, <hi>Rom. 12.</hi> wil justifie the Antichristian prelates that there reigne at this day. Secondly, the Laterane parish at Rome, is of the Popes faith, religion and worship: there are like priests like people. Now if the Bishop of that parish be Antichrist, the son of perdition, as th'Apostle telleth us, <hi>2 Thes. 2. 3.</hi> then his parishoners which have no other faith or religion then he, are also the children of damnation, <hi>2 Thes. 2. 12.</hi> and so can not be judged to be Christs true church, and in the state of grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sealed of God with his covenant unto salvation. In the Lateran Church of Rome, where Antichrist is parish priest; the people are grosse idolaters, hereticks, worshipers <note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 9. 20.</note> of Divils, and of him that <hi>sitteth as God in the Temple of God;</hi> ascribing unto him that Holyness, divine power and jurisdiction, which he doeth blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemously challenge; and mine opposite could not shew one man of that parish that differeth at all from the religion of their priest:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23010:16"/>
how is it then possible that he should be Antichrist, and they true Christians; he under wrath, they under the covenant of grace; he the very Temple of the Divil, and they the true Temple of God? For shal not the same religion and faith which justifieth them, jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth him also; when it is found in him as well as in them? Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eyther the man of syn himself must be a sainct among those saincts: or they togither with him must be (as the holy Ghost calleth them) <hi>an habitation of Divils, Revel. 18. 2.</hi> To conclude then, seing there is no true visible church of Gods institution, but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular congregation; (any other general or catholik visible church of Rome, being but the Popes own wicked fiction;) and seing An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrists parish church can no more be Christs then Antichrist him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: it can not without injury to the Apostle, and to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith, and to other scriptures, and to reason it self, be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered that the church of Rome is at this day Gods true Temple or Christs true Church. Albeit, for that there was once a true Chrrstian church <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> in Rome, and these Antichristians now profess to be the successors of the same, and pretend one faith, religion &amp; worship, and reteine some doctrines and ordinances of Christ still, which they synfully profane: they are therfore sayd to be <hi>the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God;</hi> as before I have shewed.</p>
               <p>Moreover there can no church be called the true Temple of God, but in respect of Christ the <hi>chief corner stone</hi> and foundation of the building: for he is called the <hi>living Stone,</hi> and his people are <hi>living stones, built up a spiritual house</hi> in him, and so grow up to an <hi>holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Lord, 1 Pet. 2. 4. 5 Eph. 2. 20. 21.</hi> If therfore Antichrist sitteth in the true Temple of God, he sitteth first in Christ the head, and secondarily in his body and people: but Antichrist is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weise in Christ then in a feighned profession of him, whom in deed he denyeth, <hi>1 Joh. 2. 22.</hi> therfore he is not in the Temple of God, but in respect of his profession of Christianitie and of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an societie in his people, both which are false and deceitfull, <hi>after the working of Satan, &amp; in all deceivablenes of unrighteousnes, 2 Thes. 2. 9. 10.</hi> Now it followeth, that I defend my former writings against which he excepteth; as for the reproches which he layeth upon my self, and his trifling exceptions against words and phrases, I will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt as fruitless.</p>
               <p>Wheras in scanning the Apostles words, I noted mine oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites omission of Antichrists sitting <hi>as God</hi> in the Temple of God;

Other differences if men feigne, that the pastors (or hierarchie) are the man of syn, sonns of perdition; and the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous people which be of one faith and religion with them, are men of God, and in his covenant of grace; it is farr from the trueth.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>See the like in the cases that fell out at Jerusalem and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there: when Baals idol of indignation was set at the entrie of the house of God, Ezek.</hi> 8. 3. 5. <hi>and when Antiochus Epiphanes and his officers profaned the sanctuarie and citie of Jerusalem, and set the image of Iupiter Olympius, in the Temple and seat of God, Dan.</hi> 11. 31. 36. <hi>who would not now put dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the idols and persons aforesayd on the one hand, and between the Temple and citie of God wherin they were set, and which they polluted, on the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The examples are farr unlike: first Rome, is not Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem but Babylon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. Secondly, the Temple and holy things in Ierusalem being made of senseless stones and matter, they could not be polluted with syn in themselves as the <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5.</note> living stones of Christs house the people now may soon be, and turned into a sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of Satan; as the christian churches in the Apostles dayes, are now long since turned to be Turks and Papists. Doth not the Law plainly teach us this; for in the yerely cleansing of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie, it was <hi>because of the uncleannesses of the sonns of Jsrael, and because of their trespasses, in all their synns, Levit.</hi> 16. 16. and for no uncleannes or syn in it self. Thirdly, the example of Antiochus is fit, but wrong
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:23010:18"/>
applied: for he speaketh onely of <hi>Antiochus and his officers;</hi> wheras both he, his officers and his people (the common souldjers) were they that defiled the sanctuarie of God; as it is sayd in the storie, Antiochus <hi>went up against Jsrael &amp; Jerusalem with a great multitude, and entred proudly into the Sanctuary &amp;c. 1 Maccab.</hi> 1. 20. 21. So in applying this, he would have the Pope and his officers (the hierarchie) to be the man of syn, as Antiochus and his officers: &amp; the multitude of papists at Rome, he wil not have to be (as in deed they should be counted) answerable to Antiochus soldjers; but they must be <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> answerable to the Temple of Ierusalem, a most unjust resemblance. For the Temple then was a mere patient, and suffred that abuse at Antiochus hands: so the thing answerable hereto, should be (if he would have made a fit comparison,) the Christians (Gods true Temple,) which suffer for the truthes sake at the Antichristians hands; such as are opposed to the worshipers of the beast, and those that receive his mark, of whom it is written, <hi>Here is the patience of the saincts; here are they that keep the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of God, and the faith of Jesus, Revel.</hi> 14. 9.—12. and againe, I saw <hi>the soules of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshiped the beast nor his image &amp;c, Rev.</hi> 20. 4. And such I never doubted but they were the true Temple of God: but I deny that the church of Rome at this day is such a people or such a Temple: they are the marked soldjers of Antiochus the Pope, and honour him as God in the temple of God (their pretended christian church) with high impietie. Or at least, they are like the Apostate Iewes, which turned to Antiochus religion and became heathens, with worse impietie; 1 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 1. 13. 14. 15. 43. 52.</p>
               <p>Of this sort is his next allegation, <note n="†" place="margin">pag. 14</note> where to make his reader merry, he likeneth me to <hi>the old man of Athens,</hi> which would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell the Iewes to call their Temple by the name of <hi>Iupiter Olympius,</hi> because Iupiters image was set up in it; 2 <hi>Mac.</hi> 6. 1. 2, so I would have the church of Rome called Antichrists church &amp;c. I answer: if the church, the people of Rome were now mere patients, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom Antichrist cometh in by violence, they not consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto him any more then Gods temple did to Iupiters image; it should be foolishnes in me to call it Antichrists church. Or, to put the example more fitly; if a Iew had been forced by Antiochus violently to kyss or bow the knee to Iupiters image, when he resis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and testified against it: none could justly call him an idolater,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23010:19"/>
or one of Iupiters people. But if an other Iew had revolted to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus religion, and beleeved in his Iupiter and honoured him with hart, profession and action; he now might justly be called the servant of Iupiter, or one of his people, (as the Moabites are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the people of Chemosh, Numb. 21. 29.</hi>) So the church of Rome now fallen from true Christianity, and beleeving, worshiping, obeying Antichrist, the Popes holynes, are and may justly be called his church: or else Antichrist hath no temple, church or people in the world.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There is not so great difference as mine opposite would pretend. First I cited not Augustine for his own judgment, but for others whom he speaketh of, touching the translation of the Text, <hi>in the Temple of God,</hi> or, <hi>for the Temple.</hi> Secondly, he setteth down Augustines words maymed both at head and foot. For Augustine beginneth thus: <hi>But in what temple of God he shal sit as God, is uncertaine: whether in that ruine of the Temple which was built by King Solomon; or in the church. For that which is the temple of any idol or divil, the Apostle would not call the temple of God:</hi> &amp;c. Now the ruine of Solomons temple, cannot at this day be called <hi>Gods temple,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weise then because it was the Temple of God of old; &amp; hath now no more holynes in deed &amp; trueth, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other place in the world. And thus I have granted that the church of Rome may be called the church of God, in respect that there was a church there in Pauls time, wheras now it hath no more true holynes, then the synagogue of Satan. So we see how for advantage mine opposite baulked Augustines first words. In the end, he breaketh off in the midst of a period: for Augustine sayth, <hi>sitteth for a friend, that is as a friend: or if any other thing is wont to be understood by this kind of speech,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:23010:20"/>
So he defineth not certainly of this place, but leaves it doubtfull: and presently after confesseth his ignorance; <hi>For what is</hi> this (sayth Augustine) <hi>For the mysterie of iniquitie doth already work, onely he who now holdeth let him hold, till he be taken out of the way. J confess my self to be utterly ignorant what he meaneth.</hi> Thus we need not strive about Augustines words here: and I grant, that the Apostle would not have called it <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> unless eyther it were so in deed and trueth, or had been so in times past, or did pretend to be so still. And I think all wil likewise grant, that the holy Ghost would not have called the witches spirit at endor <note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 28.</note>

                  <hi>the house of their God,</hi> unless eyther it were so in deed, or in pretense: which phrase when the Greek translateth according to the letter, <hi>the house of their God,</hi> and the Chaldee paraphrast (as ancient as the Apostles age) expoundeth <hi>the house of their idols,</hi> they contradict not one another: seing the same thing may be Gods in shew, and the divils in deed and trueth: for even <hi>Satan himself is transformed into an Angel of light; 2 Cor. 11. 14.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. When the Apostle describeth the mysterie of Antichrists iniquitie, would he teach the church that the place of his sitting is the Temple of God, if he meant that it were in deed the synagogue of Satan and the temple of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist? For that Antichrist should sit in the temple of Antichrist and sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue of Satan, what mysterie is there in it? All the world would easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that these agreed very well and most fitly togither. But for Antichrist to sit in Gods temple and Christs church, this is in deed a mysterie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The mysterie of iniquitie began in the true church, but continued not therein alwayes: for when it was discerned, the church eyther cast it out, or soon degenerated into a synagogue of Satan, if it accepted Antichrist for God, as the Church of Rome doth at this day. Which I further manifest thus, 1. The Apostle sayth, <hi>As ye have heard that Antichrist shal come, even now are there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Antichrists, &amp;c. They went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us, but (they went out) that they might be made manifest, that they were not all of us.</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:23010:20"/>
                  <hi>Who is a lyer, but he that denyeth that Jesus is the Christ? he is Antichrist, that denyeth the Father and the Son. Whosoever denyeth the Son, the same hath not the Father: 1. Joh. 2. 18. 19. 22. 23.</hi> This scripture teacheth us first that all hereticks departing from the faith of Christ, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Antichrists, though they reteyn the name of Christians still, as did the hereticks in th'Apostles time. 2. That such are gone out from the church, and are in deed none of it, though they pretend to be the true church, as all hereticks have doen. 3. That both teachers and people departed from the faith and church of Christ, are comprehended under the name of Antichrists, and not the Bishops onely. 4. That whosoever is Antichrist (especially the great Antichrist) he denyeth the Son (Christ) and consequently God the Father. Now let us apply these things to the Bishop and hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie of Rome, whome mine opposite granteth to be the great Antichrist. If the Pope and his hierarchie be Antichrist, then are they none of the Apostolik church, but gone out of the same: but they are Antichrist (by my opposites owne confession:) Therfore they are none of th'Apostolik church.</p>
               <p>The Pope and his hierarchie are both in and of the church of Rome, the heads, teachers and principall members of it, of the same faith, religion and worship: but they are not in or of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolik christian church, as before is proved: therfore the church of Rome is not an apostolik Christian church.</p>
               <p>If the church of Rome denyeth both the Father and the Son: then is it Antichrist (as the Apostle sayth) and so no true Christian church. But the church of Rome denyeth both the Father and the Son: therfore it is no true Christian church.</p>
               <p>If the Pope &amp; his hierarchie deny both the Father and the Son, then the church of Rome also denyeth them; for they beleeve as the Pope and hierarchie beleeveth, have one and the same religion with their preists. But the Pope and his hierarchie deny both the Father and the Son, otherweise they are not the Antichrist, (as mine opposite sayth they are:) therefore the Church of Rome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so denyeth both the Father and the Son. Now seing it is thus, how is it possible that it should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue the true Church of Christ, otherweise then by lying pretext and ostentation? And this is the <hi>mysterie of inquitie,</hi> if men could comprehend it that the Bishops and people of Rome, being at first Christs true church, departed by degrees from the faith &amp; worship of God; til they came joyntly

               <p>Now where he objecteth, <hi>what mysterie is there in it, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ should sit in the temple of Antichrist?</hi> I answer, it is a great myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in that it is doen by him and his, under the name and shew of Christianitie; and as the Apostle sayth, <hi>after the working of Satan, with all power and signes and lying wonders, and with all deceivablenes of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes,</hi> 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 9. 10. And where he further sayth, <hi>but for Antichrist to sit in Christs church, this is in deed a mysterie;</hi> I answer, it is in deed a contrarietie and impossibilitie (not a mysterie:) <hi>for no man can serve two masters, Mat.</hi> 6. 24. <hi>of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage,</hi> 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>to whom</hi> men <hi>yeild</hi> themselves <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to obey, his servants</hi> they are to whom they obey, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 16. Now the church of Rome, yeilding unto and obeying Antichrist, cannot be the servants of Christ, if th' Apostles doctrine be true. And after mine opposites manner of reasoning, an other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> man might say, seing Christianitie is the <hi>mystirie of godlines,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. as Antichristianitie is <hi>the mysterie of iniquitie,</hi> 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 7. Christ must sit in the Temple of Satan, as Antichrist sitteth in the temple of God: for for Christ to sit in the Temple &amp; church of Christ, what mysterie is there in it? but for Christ to sit in Satans temple, and Antichrists church, this is in deed a mysterie. Were not this (think we) good reasoning, to put darknes for light, and light for darknes; Christ into Antichrists place, and Antichrist into Christs; for to finde out a mysterie?

               <p>Answ. I oppugne the present church of Rome, which Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ destroyeth not, but buildeth and adorneth as an alluring harlot: the Christian church which was in Rome of old, that hath he invaded and destroyed long since; for they then were <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> Saints, such as he hateth: these now are worshipers of him and of idols &amp; <note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 9. 20. &amp; 18. 2.</note> Divils; and are <hi>an habitation of Divils.</hi> So there is as much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the church of Rome now, and the church then: as between the Bishop of Rome now, &amp; the Bishops then: they were Christs ministers, this now is Antichrist, as mine opposite himself confesseth.

But this is meant of Nebuchadnezars invading of Ierusalem to spoile the same, as the historie sheweth, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 25. and in him, Antichrists tyrannie against the church was lively figured.

               <p>Wheras mine opposite expounded the <hi>Temple of God</hi> to be the church, and shewed not whether he meant a church particular, or general and catholik; I sayd for a particular church, <hi>it wil not agree with the prophesies of Antichrist, whose citie or church is so great, as peoples, kinreds, tongues &amp; nations, doe dwell in the streets therof, Rev.</hi> 11. 8. 9.

and in special the Lateran church in Rome, where the Pope is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish priest. I shew by <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 8. that the Popes parish is a larger citie or church then eyther that Lateran parish or Rome it self, even o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver many nations; and so can not be a particular church such as Christ instituted; but a new catholik church which the Pope hath devised, and would have it accounted the Temple and church of God. Here mine opposite, laboureth to finde a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Beasts <hi>citie</hi> and his church: but all in vaine. For thus he reasoneth.</p>
               <p>1. <note n="†" place="margin">Chr. plea pag. 152.</note> 
                  <hi>This citie in Rev.</hi> 11. 8. <hi>is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. But the church is here called the Temple of God, or the Court without the Temple, or the holy Citie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. First then he granteth that the same church may be called both a <hi>temple</hi> &amp; a <hi>citie:</hi> so the diverse name helpeth him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Secondly, it is true that Antichrists church is called So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Egypt which was an whole countrie: let men now judge how fitly mine opposite hath confined Antichrists church within the Laterane parish, a corner in Rome. Shall we rather beleeve him, or the Holy Ghost? Thirdly that is called the <hi>Holy citie, Rev.</hi> 11. 2. which the Gentiles (the church of Antichrist) tread under foot, as destroyed and wast: wheras the church of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ is a great citie called <hi>Babylon,</hi> sumptuously builded, garnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by him mainteyned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. and that is the church of Rome at this day, as all know: and of the present church of Rome is now our controversie.</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. <hi>This great citie is that where our Lord was crucified, Rev.</hi> 11. 8. <hi>Now all know that he was crucified in and vnder the jurisdiction of the citie, not of the church of Rome. For he was condemned by Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. The thing he aimeth at, is that the <hi>citie</hi> mentioned in <hi>Rev,</hi> 11. 8. is a civil politie, as when Rome killed Christ; and not an ecclesiastical politie or church. But he laboureth in the winde: for the citie is such as is the Beast or kingdome: the Beast is a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al politie most synful, for it commeth out of the <hi>bottomles pit, Rev.</hi> 11. 7. that is from the Divil; wheras all Civil polities are from God, though they be heathens, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. 2. Secondly he should have knowen, that the same Citie which was a civil politie in Christs time, &amp; killed him: is now subordinate to an ecclesiastical politie, church, or Papacie; and stil crucifieth Christ in his members.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:23010:23"/>Obj. 3. <hi>This citie is that which was the Dragons throne, and by him given to the Beast, Revel.</hi> 13. 2. <hi>But this was the citie, not the church of Rome. Neyther J think wil these men themselves say, that the church was the Dragons throne, or was by the Dragon given to the beast.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. The citie or politie which the Dragon gave to the Beast, was civil, but is now subjected to, or become ecclesiastical: for the citie of Rome is now by profession Christen, which of old was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then: and by professed Christians (namely the Pope &amp; his church) are those witnesses of God killed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. 8. so their corpses lye unburied in the streets of the beasts citie, that is of Antichrists church or politie, which reacheth over many nations.</p>
               <p>Obj. 4. <hi>This citie also is the throne of the Beast, and Babylon the great citie spoken of Rev.</hi> 16. 10. 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. <hi>chapt. which is to be understood of the citie of Rome and dominion therof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. It is granted that this citie is Babylon, and Rome, and the dominion therof: but it is a spiritual politie or church: for who hath dominion now of Rome, but the Pope or Bishop there, the pretended vicar of Christ; and who but he hath killed those Martyrs, within his Diocese or Bishoprick, which reacheth over many kingdoms?</p>
               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Answ. Yes, the same heathen citie which was first set on seven hills; is now a pretended Christian citie, sitting still on her 7 hills: and being a Christian in name, hath killed Christ in his members, by her Popes power ecclesiastical, who hath his seat in her, but his Dragons pawes reach into farr countries.

Kings or kindes of government then fallen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. Ill doe they thrive, that kick against the pricks. Here himself confesseth the Popes goverment to be one of the seven: now the Popes goverment or papacie, is an ecclesiastical monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie; by it were the witnesses of Christ slayn, as before I shewed.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:23010:24"/>
As for seven goverments to be found in the church of Rome, that is in the papacie, is absurd; for it is to seek 7. kindes of goverment in one. But six are gone and the seventh remayneth by the Pope. That citie or politie which once was heathen, now Christian in name (Antichristian in deed;) which the Pope menageth: is the malignant church that killeth Gods witnesses, amongst <hi>peoples, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reds, tongues and nations, Rev. 11. 8. 9.</hi> Therfore it can not be restrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to one particular congregation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. 7. This citie is that which reigned over the kings of the earth in Johns time, Rev. 17. 8. And that not the church but the citie of Rome so reigned when John wrote, all doe acknowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> But, that the citie the church of Rome now reigneth by the Pope the head of that church, all doe acknowledge. And the killing of those witnesses <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. was not in Iohns time, but after, when the citie or politie of Rome was become Christian in name and title. To say, it was not so in Iohns time, therfore it is not so now; is dallying, rather then sound reasoning.</p>
               <p>Obj. 8. <hi>Finally, the Lord himself putteth difference between this citie Babylon, and his people therin, Rev. 18. 4. as of old, in Babylon of Chalde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is true; but what can he inferr thereupon? It was not Gods people in Babylon, that killed those witnesses, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. but it was Babylon that killed those witnesses, Gods people ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Because Gods people killed not those witnesses, but the Beast in his catholik citie or church: therfore (thinks he) that citie of the beast, is not his church; a fayre conclusion.</p>

If the Candlesticks were churches in the Temple the church: then the Temple in such respect is the catholick church, for one particular church is not in an other. 2. I grant that the church of Rome was a golden candlestick in th'Apostles time: and I think mine opposite would not deny but then also the Bishop of Rome, was a <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 1. 20.</note> starr in Christs right hand. But now the Bishop
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:23010:25"/>
is a starr fallen from heaven, and acknowledged to be Antichrist: why then may not the church be fallen with him, (as Paul fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned, <hi>Rom. 11. 22.</hi>) and the candlestick removed from it, as wel as from Ephesus, <hi>Rev. 2. 5.</hi> except Rome have a privilege above all other cities, because it crucified Christ. 3. I grant also that the true churches apostate in <hi>Rev. 2. &amp; 3.</hi> were still <hi>golden candlesticks,</hi> though some of them rustie: but I would have it likewise graunted me, that there were other churches but copper candlesticks, though they pretended to be golden; namely such Antichristian haeretical synagogues, as of whom it might be sayd, <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us, 1. Joh. 2. 18. 19.</hi> And if those petty Antichrists were no golden candlesticks; much less can the great Antichrist with his synagogue, be a golden candlestick; for he farr exceedeth them in idolatrie, heresie and impietie. That An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist could sit in any true church then, as he sitteth now in the church of Rome, namely <hi>as God,</hi> and so to be beleeved with his lyes, worshiped, and obeyed; I utterly deny: for that church that so doeth, departeth from Christ the foundation, and <hi>denyeth both the Father and the Son, 1 Ioh. 2. 22. 23.</hi> and whether it be a particular church, or a more general, it skilleth not: universalitie in worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Beast, causeth but universalitie of damnation, <hi>Rev. 13. 16. 17. &amp; 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. 10. 11.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> By this then it appeareth, that the church of Rome lyeth apparantly, when she calleth her self the catholik church: and therfore is not the true church or Temple of God.

                  <hi>Christians catholik or particular wherin Antichrist sate since th'apostasie of the man of syn, but such as worshiped the Dragon and the beast?

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> He seemeth to use the word <hi>sit</hi> in two senses; 1. for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing, blaspheming, killing the Saincts that resisted Antichrist; and 2. for quiet governing and having in subjection the wicked that beleeve and obey him: with such aequivocations his writings are too full. Such churches or persons as resisted the beast, and whom he blasphemed and killed: they were of God; and of them there is no question. But the other sort given over of God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve lyes, and to worship the man of syn as God, like as he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him self that he is God; they are not the true church of God, catholik or particular: and of such is the present church of Rome, now i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and men of grace; which how it can be, when both parties are of one and the same faith, worship, religion  it passeth my slender capacitie. For if the Bishops priests and deacons have one faith &amp; religion with the people, as it is knowen they have; and the people have the true Christian faith and religion, though corrupted, yet so as they are still under the covenant of grace, and sealed of God therin by baptisme: how should not the same faith give life to the priests or hierarchie, as it doeth to the people?

               <p>This point is of weight, to give light to our controversie, for if the whole church, Pope, priests and people, be altogither a <hi>man of syn,</hi> &amp; <hi>son of perdition;</hi> then can not any of sound judgment, think they are a true Christian church, or under the covenant of Gods grace.</p>
               <p>To shew this therfore; first, the scriptures sundry times spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of a whole state or company, both governours and people, as of one person, man, woman, or child: as in <hi>Hos 1. 4. 6. 9.</hi> the three children <hi>Iezreel, Lo-ruhamah,</hi> and <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi> signified the three es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of the congregation of Israel, then shortly to follow.

Secondly, as Christ and Antichrist have their several churches, so these ech of them are called <hi>a man:</hi> as in <hi>Ephes. 2. 15.</hi> Christ is there sayd <hi>to make in himself, of twaine</hi> (that is, of two peoples, Iewes and Gentiles) <hi>one new man:</hi> where the whole church togither with Christ their head, is called <hi>a new man.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, Antichrist the Pope, togither with his whole church, is called <hi>the man of syn.</hi> And as in the <hi>new man</hi> the true Christian church, Christ the head hath in all things the preheminence: so in the <hi>man of syn,</hi> the Antichristian church, the Pope (Christs preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vicar) hath in all things the preeminence, exalted for power &amp; pretended holynes. As the <hi>new man</hi> the Christian church, is to be esteemed in the state of salvation, though some secret hypocrites and reprobates closely creep in among them here on earth: so the <hi>man of syn</hi> the Antichristian church, is to be estemed in the state of <note n="†" place="margin">2 Thes. 2. 10. 12.</note> damnation, though some of Gods elect and hidden ones are in the same, <hi>Rev. 18. 4.</hi> And this man of syn the Pope and his church, sitteth <hi>in the Temple of God,</hi> the profession of Christ (whom the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

That Temple was not infected with syn, but the syn rested in the persons that worshiped in it, or came into it; as I shewed before, from <hi>Levit. 16. 16.</hi> Wheras the church of Rome is so infected with Antichrists syn, as mine opposite confesseth it to be <note n="†" place="margin">Chr. plea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That temple merely suffred that misusage at the hands of synners, Iewes and Gentiles: even as Christ, the true Temple in his humanitie, &amp; true Christians his members have suffred, at the hands of the Romans, of old heathens and now Antichristians. But to make that temple a type of this malignant church, which togither with her head the Pope, persecuteth Christ and his saincts, and worshipeth creatures, idols and <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 9. 20.</note> Divils; is altogither amyss. For so we might conclude thus: As the Temple of God though it were defiled with the apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie &amp; idolatrie of the Iewes and of the Gentiles, with how great abomination soever; yet continued Gods holy Temple still; and could not by any impietie become the Temple of Antichrist or of Satan: so the church of Rome, though it should be defiled with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie idolatrie prophanenesse atheisme eyther of Antichrist or of Iewes Turks or Pagans; if it should beleeve and receive the religion of Maomet or of Iulian the Apostata; yet should it continue the true church and people of God, and under his covenant of grace.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:23010:28"/>
Behold what favour the church of Rome hath found above all churches under heaven: that if she receive Iudaisme or Paganisme, if she worship the Beast; the Dragon, or Divil himself by open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, yet the abideth the church of God: for if Antiochus who set up Iupiter Olympius image in the Temple, had set up also the professed worship of the Divil; yet the Temple should have been Gods holy temple notwithstanding; and so by proportion the church of Rome must be, if this comparison of mine opposites be true. By such doctrine, the whole gospel of Christ is overthrowne. For faith and sanctimonie of life, are the summe of all the gospell: and both of them are destroyed. For though Rome be apostate and departed from the faith, as Paul foretold, <hi>1 Tim. 4. 1.</hi> though she beleeve in a wafer cake, and worship it for her God and maker: though she beleeve to have forgivenes of synns, by the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble massing sacrifice of her priests, by the pardons and indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of her popes, and to merit salvation in heaven, by wicked works which she doeth, being taught by the Man of syn: though she have many thousands of new Gods and new Christs, even so many as there be Angels and saincts in heaven, and moe too: though she be as filthy in life as <hi>Sodom,</hi> as idolatrous &amp; malignant against Gods people as were <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> (unto which the holy Ghost hath compared her, <hi>Rev 11. 8. &amp; 14. 8.</hi>) yet so long as she wil say to Christ, but as the Divil sayd, <hi>Thou art Christ the son of God, Luke 4. 41.</hi> that is, so long as she reteyneth the profession of Christianitie; she is the Temple of God, the church of Christ, and under the covenant of salvation.</p>
               <p>But he that <hi>justifieth the wicked</hi> is <hi>an abomination to the Lord, Prov. 16. 15.</hi> and <hi>woe unto them that say concerning evil, it is good, Esa. 5. 20.</hi> Can not men put difference between Gods ordinances given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a people, &amp; the people: themselves that injoy, use or abuse those ordinances? The Temple was an ordinance given unto Israel, as were the altars and sacrifices therin: so God gave unto all the world by Noe, commandements for altars and sacrifices, Gen. 8. 20. unto Abraham he commanded circumcision, unto Christians baptisme, the Supper of Christ &amp;c. All Gods ordinances continue in themselves holy, (till God doe abrogate them,) though men that abuse them, fall to be most unholy, and without God in the world. So the sacrifices of sheep and Oxen were in themselves Gods holy ordinances, howsoever abused by the Iewes in Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:23010:29"/>
by the Israelites in Samaria, and by the heathens in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall lands: so circumcision, though profaned by the Sichemites <hi>Gen. 34.</hi> so baptisme and the Lords supper, though turned by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ into abominable idols; remayned and doe remaine in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Gods holy ordinances, though men have abused them to their damnation: so the Sun moon and starrs continued Gods good creatures, though men made idols of them to themselves. To reason therfore from the creatures and ordinances, unto men which abuse them; and to gather because the creature or ordinance abideth good in it self, therfore the person that abuseth it, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth good also: or to wrest a type, as mine opposite doeth, from a creature or ordinance of old, to a most synfull people now, and make them alike holy; is an high abuse of Gods ordinances, and a taking of his name in vaine.</p>

Yet <hi>every way</hi> (sayth he) <hi>it wil folow that the state of the sayd church</hi> (of Rome) <hi>and Christians, is to be esteemed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the estate of the Temple at Ierusalem, and particularly with reference to the court and holy citie given to the gentiles: and therfore is to be accounted the church and citie of God, as the other were his court and citie, though pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted</hi> &amp;c. This I deny: the church or people of Rome at this day, is not answerable to the Temple or court, or city of Ierusalem in holynes: but to the gentiles, in profanenes. And I have before manifested his great abuse of that proportion, from the Temple polluted, yet continuing the Lords, and holy in it self; to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple apostate and fallen from the Lord, from his faith and worship, to the faith and worship of Antichrist.</p>
               <p>In sted of proofs, he offreth things to be <hi>considered:</hi> The first wherof I leave, as not perteyning to our controversie: though it may seem not agreable, that the most holy place should be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as figuring heaven; seeing in the 19. verse, when the Temple
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:23010:29"/>
was opened, the <hi>Ark</hi> of Gods testament was seen in it: and the Ark, was set in the most holy place, <hi>2 Chron. 5. 7.</hi> It is true that that place figured heaven, <hi>Heb. 9. 24.</hi> but it might also figure other things on earth, as the Temple it self, figured both Christ, and the Church, as we have formerly heard.</p>
               <p>His second consideration is, <hi>whether by the temple of God here, may not be understood the holy place, and figuratively faithfull Christians, and more inward church of God, invisible to men, but seen and preserved of God, &amp;c. And by the Altar and worshipers, be figuratively noted the spirituall worship and mediation of Christ, with faithfull Christians and worshipers (made Priests unto God) who wholly and onely rely vpon Christ &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. Seing here are three distinct things, the <hi>Temple,</hi> the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> and the <hi>worshipers:</hi> it seemeth unfit to confound the first with the last; the <hi>worshipers</hi> here are the faithful Christians, which serve God in his <hi>Temple,</hi> (as <hi>Rev 7. 15.</hi>) and upon his <hi>Altar.</hi> To make the <hi>Temple</hi> to signify faithful Christians here, when the <hi>worshipers</hi> are the faithful Christians here themselves: it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itteth not the vision. Rather, as the Temple figured Christ in his humanitie, <hi>Joh. 2. 19. 21.</hi> God manifested in the flesh, in whom God dwelt, &amp; in whom all doe serve the Lord; and as the golden altar of incense figured his mediation, the brazen altar for sacrifice, figured his oblation of himself for his Church: so here the measuring of the Temple, Altar, and worshipers, signifieth the restauration of Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from the Apostasie of Antichrist; the <hi>Temple of God</hi> signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Christ truely professed for his person, or doctrine of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie, &amp; constitution of the Church therein: the Altar is the true doctrine of his oblation and mediation for us; and the worshipers are the faithfull Christians, that worship God in the true professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ and of his mediation and sacrifice, as in the true Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and altar of God, contrary to the heresies and abominations of Antichrist.</p>
               <p>His third and fourth considerations are, <hi>by the Court without the Temple, to be noted in figure the visible church &amp; Christians. By the holy citie (Jerusalem) to be noted in figure oyther the visible church and outward state of Christians more generally, or such as are truly godly and Gods holy church more particularly. By the Gentiles to understand hethens and rebellious Jewes, that is profane and wicked Christians, the Antichristian hierarchi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and other things, as one: secondly in shuffling true Christians and Antichristians as one bodie: thirdly in restreyning the gentiles or heathens (spoken of in <hi>Revel. 11. 2.</hi>) to the Pope and his hierarchie onely. 1. The thing here shewed in vision, was after the manner of Ierusalem and the Temple of old: there, the Temple was not the people, neyther were the courts, the people, neyther the citie, when it was distinct from the citizens: but they were holy places and signes appointed of God for the people to worship him in &amp; by them. 2. True visible Christians (which he sayth are the court and citie) and Antichristians (or as he would have it the Pope and his hierarchie,) whom the Lord calleth <hi>Gentiles</hi> or <hi>heathen;</hi> he would have mixed togither as one body and church, the Antichristian heathens to be the Bishops and pastors, and the visible Christians to be the flock; and this for the space of <hi>1260. yeres,</hi> as himself num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth the 42. moneths, a day for a yere. Which is contrary to the whole scope of this book of the Revelation; which sheweth the true Christians to be such as are marked and sealed of God, <hi>Revel 7. 3. &amp;c.</hi> having his name in their foreheads, virgines, and folowers of the Lamb, <hi>Rev. 14. 1. 4.</hi> such as worship not the Beast, or his image, neyther receive his mark on forehead or hand, <hi>Rev. 20 4.</hi> whereas by his exposition, the true visible Christians are those that worship the beast, as the church of Rome doeth and have doen these many yeres. 3. That the gentiles should be onely the Pope and hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, agreeth neyther with trueth nor type: for whether he respect the rebellious Iewes or faithless Gentiles; it can never be shewed at any time, that they were onely Priests and Levices, or Kings captaines and officers, that trode down Ierusalem, or dwelt in the court without the Temple: but people with priests, and soldjers with captaines; that strange it is from whence he should gather this interpretation. And though many of all sorts have expounded this book; yet never read I of any one, neyther doeth he cite any one man that ever was of his minde, so to interpret these things; but it was his owne singular conceyt.</p>
               <p>As for the key which should open the dore to the understanding of this vision, namely, the commandement to <hi>measure the Temple</hi> &amp;c. with the <hi>reed, vers. 1.</hi> this he omitteth. But with that wil I begin.</p>
               <p>After that God, for the idolatries and other synns, of the Iewes, had delivered the holy citie Ierusalem and the Temple therin, into

               <p>His exposition of making the Temple, altar, and worshipers to signify the invisible church of Gods elect; and the Gentiles with the Court and holy Citie to be the visible church of hypocrites: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeth neyther with this place, nor with Esai. 1.

For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weise, if he did understand Antichrists sitting in the Temple of God, to be his treading down of his Temple, as here he treadeth down the holy Citie, having ruined and burnt it, and keeps it from being reedified, as the Babylonians did during their reigne, I would not have contended with him about it. But then his apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it to the church of Rome, which the Pope hath builded, honoured, garnished as a most gorgeous harlot: would be altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unfit; and agree no better then Babylon did with Sion. But of that place <hi>2 Thes. 2.</hi> we have spoken at large before.</p>
               <p>Wheras heretofore he pleaded, that Antichrist <hi>doth not wholly take away the church of God, and every trueth and ordinance of the Lord:</hi> and I answered, <hi>Neyther did the Deviltake away every trueth and ordinance of God from among the heathens, but they reteyned many rites of Gods worship received from their fathers</hi> &amp;c. First <note n="*" place="margin">Chr. plea pag. 165.</note> he blameth me as <hi>shifting</hi> &amp;c. for not saying, <hi>the Divil took not wholly away, the church of God from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the heathens:</hi> I answer, if by church, he understand the order and constitution of the church, the heathens strayed not furder from it, then Antichrist hath by his counterfei catholik church: and whosoever wil bring them to the trial, it wil soon appeare. Or, if he understand by Church, Gods people, (as he hath now his people in this Romish Babylon, <hi>Rev. 18.</hi>) I also say, that the Divil took not away the church wholly from the heathens for God had many elect among them, whom by means he called from heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish idols, to the true faith: of whom there are many instances of sundry persons in the scriptures; and I doubt not but there were many moe, whose names are written in the book of life. The dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persion of Israel among the nations, might bring many heathens to the faith; as we have an instance in <hi>Esth. 8. 17.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To that which I sayd, <hi>that the Divil did not take away wholly every truth and ordinance of God from among the heathen:</hi> he answereth, <hi>it is nothing to the purpose, seing they are not the church and people of God, under his covenant neyther doe so injoy any of them.</hi>

               <p>Object. <hi>Take an instance</hi> (<hi>sayth he</hi>) <hi>in one of the particulars which he mentioned, where he sayd that</hi> the heathens reteyn baptismes or wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings among them: <hi>yet when any of them leave that estate, and come to the faith and church of Christ, they are to be baptised into the Lords name &amp;c. but so may not be doen with those that have received baptisme in the church of Rome, or any other apostate churches, when they leave such estate &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, he wresteth my words, spoken of the heathens of old, which reteyned baptismes or washings whiles they were Gods ordinances: and applieth them to their washings now, when they are none of Gods ordinances. I sayd, <note n="*" place="margin">Animadv pag. 76.</note> 
                  <hi>the ordinances of God reteyned in other nations</hi> (besides Israel) <hi>as Altars, sacrifices</hi> &amp;c, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged authors, before Christs coming in the flesh: he setteth down these as my words, <hi>the heathens reteine</hi> &amp;c. Had I thus altered the case, I should have been charged with <hi>shifting,</hi> and that justly. But I acknowledge not tho legal washings, sacrifices, altars &amp;c. of Gentiles or Iewes to be God's ordinances now, as they were before Christs death. That which he sayth of baptisme not to be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I grant: and so must he have doen for circumcision among the heathens, such as reteyned it for a divine ordinance, as they did their sacrifices. I instanced <note n="†" place="margin">Animadv pag. 75.</note> the <hi>Colchians, Egyptians, Ethiopians;</hi> and the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> which latter Mr. Iohnson acknowledged to have <hi>still used circumcision,</hi> and yet were not Gods true Church. But this he passed over, and answereth not. Now he would bring in the heathenish washings at this day, which is a plaine tergiversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

And such Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites as embraced the religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Assyrians &amp; Babylonians cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be Gods people actually, til they repented: others that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted evil and kept the trueth, as <note n="*" place="margin">Dan. 1. 8. &amp; 3. 18.</note> Daniel and his brethren; were
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:23010:36"/>
Gods holy people. So all in Rome and Turkie that abide in the truth refusing their abominations, are Gods holy people: the rest that have received Maometisme and Antichristianisme, are not Gods people actually; albeit many of them are Gods elect, and shal so be manifested when they come out from them. But mine opposite changeth the state of the question, turning it from Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon it self, to Israel Gods people in Babylon; and so from the Church of Rome now Babylon, to the faithful witnesses of Christ therin; of whom none make doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4. Js there not difference to be put between the people of God in Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, and Babylon it self? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes; which whiles it is not held unto, we are dallied with. The controversie is about the church of Rome it self, which is Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon: the reasons given, are for Gods people (open or secret) in that Babylon. Who seeth not the deceyt? For God hath had his people in Rome, not onely when it was Antichristian, but when it was heathen: and multitudes have been killed for Christ therin, in both estates. This justifieth not, but condemneth Rome, the murderer of the Saincts.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. Note here, 1. That the people of God pollute his temple, become apostates and idolaters, and are captived in Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> But note withall, that they have their temple of God, and holy citie, consumed with fyre; and are caried out of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly land, into an other synfull nation, as before is shewed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2. That thus now Sion is in Babylon, and consequently the Temple of God (so to speak) the people of G. the church of G. is in Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:23010:37"/>
                  <hi>Ans. So to speak!</hi> But the speech is unproper, and God no where speaketh so. The visible Temple was burnt; and they had none with them in Babylon, but Bels temple, none of the Lords. The lost sheep, the people of God <hi>perteyning to mount Sion,</hi> (as whileere he sayd) were in Babylon. And for his figurative applying of the <hi>Temple</hi> here, to the <hi>people</hi> or <hi>church;</hi> it is amyss: it should be applyed to God himself. For so the Lord sayth by the Prophet, <hi>though I have scattred them among the countries, yet wil J be to them as a little Sanctuarie, in the countries where they shal come, Ezek. 11. 16.</hi> So the Lord, not the people, was the Sanctuarie or temple in Babylon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3. Stil they are acknowledged of God, to be Sion, his people &amp;c, though in Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> So I alwayes and stil acknowledge God to have his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Babylon the church of Rome. But it should be proved (if it were possible) that Babylon is Sion; or the church of Rome, to be the church of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4. The Lord calleth them from thence by diverse prophets &amp;c. 5. Being so called, they did not all come togither at once &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> These things are true: and so for the Lords calling of his people out of Babylon now. But it is not yet concluded, (not ever wilbe soundly) that the Babylonians are Gods people; except the elect, which belong to mount Sion, though-actually in Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj. There wilbe of Gods people yet called from thence, even then when this Babylon (the citie of Rome) shalbe burnt with fyre, and cast down, never to rise any more. Rev. 18. 4. 8. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This conclusion is partly true, and partly implieth error. It is true, that there shalbe of Gods people called out of Babylon, til she be utterly cast down. But the errour implied is, that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Babylon <hi>the citie</hi> (not <hi>the church</hi>) of Rome: and seemeth also to restreyn it to the citie properly, and to the burning of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial citie and houses therof.

And when God calleth his <note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 18.</note> people out of Babylon: it is not meant out of Rome onely, or Italic<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Spaine also and all other places where Poperie reigneth. Neyther is it meant in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:23010:38"/>
regard of civil politie, as if the subjects in Italie, Spaine and other lands, might not remaine in those comon wealthes still; but they are called out from the heresies, idolatries and extravagant juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Romish church. So the civil bondage of the Iewes in the old Babylon, typed the spiritual bondage of Gods people in this new Babylon, the church of Rome: and out of it are men called, not out of the civil state, or material place. For who will deny, but Christian churches may dwel in Spaine, Italie, yea and Rome it self (if the magistrates wil suffer them,) and yet not disobey this precept <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Come out of her my people.</hi> It is a doctrine of grace, and necessarie unto salvation to come out of the church e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of this Romish Babylon, but to understand it of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealths estate, and to call men out of it, were a doctrine of rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, contrarie to <hi>Rom. 13. 1. 1. Pet. 2. 13. 14.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wheras I concluded, <hi>Gods covenant of grace is not therefore with her at all, for she is appointed to damnation, 2 Thes. 2. 8. 12. Rev. 18. 8.—21. but the elect that obey Gods voice calling them out of her, them hee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into covenant, he will be a father unto them, and they shalbe his sonns &amp; daughters, as he hath promised. 2. Cor. 6. 17. 18.</hi> He replyeth: <hi>As if they were not already under the covenant of God, being his people: or as if they could be the Lords people and yet not be under his covenant. The Jewes knew better when they were in Babylon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon prayed, as in Esai. 63. 17. 18. 19. &amp; 64. 7. 8. 9. Returne to the tribes of thine inheritance &amp;c, we are thine &amp;c. O Lord thou art our father &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. The people of God in Rome, being his elect; are under his covenant in regard of his electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which was <note n="†" place="margin">Eph. 1. 4.</note> before the world began: but until they be called &amp; come out; they appear not unto men to be under the visible covenant of Gods church, whereof Paul speaketh in the place alleaged, <hi>2 Cor. 6.</hi> That the godly Iewes in Babylon, figured Gods elect, I before shewed from <hi>Rom. 11. 4. 5. 7.</hi> and mine opposite gainsayeth it not. That God calleth the elect <hi>his people,</hi> even before they know or obey his voice, was shewed him also heretofore, when God sayd to Paul of heathenish Corinth, <hi>J have much people in this citie, Act. 18. 10.</hi> yet Paul knew not who they were, till after they beleeved by his preaching. So Christ sayd, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sheep J have which are not of this fold, Ioh. 10. 16.</hi> speaking of the elect gentiles, whiles yet they were not <hi>sheep</hi> actually before men; but wild beasts of the wood. His comparison from <hi>Esai. 63.</hi> if it be referred to the Martyrs which the church of Rome hath imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:23010:38"/>
killed, banished for the trueth: is fit, and I acknowledge them visibly under Gods covenant. But referred to them that are one with the church of Rome, in her faith and religion; it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitt. For those people of God in Babylon, were in civil bondage, but in freedome of spirit, and not servants to syn: such were <note n="*" place="margin">Dan. 1. and 3. 18</note> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, Ananias, and other saints. But these of the Romish church &amp; religion, are in spiritual bondage to Antichrist, and so partakers of his synns, <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 6. 1. 20. 2 Pet. 2. 19.</note> and in state of death, by mans judgement; till they obey their calling and come forth; though God knoweth them before to be his people, by election of grace. By this which hath been sayd, the wise may discerne, what weight there is in <hi>Rev. 18.</hi> to prove Babylon (the present church of Rome,) to be the church of God, because out of her, God calleth his people. And let all men take notice of the mayn ground of his errour, that he would have Babylon now, to be the civil state or material citie; when in deed it is the ecclesiastical or church. For God calleth not peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples out of their civil states, (it is a doctrine of rebellion so to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it, and contrary to <hi>Rom. 13:</hi>) but from their synfull ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical estate. All civil states, though governed by Popish yea or heathenish magistrates, are sanctified to Gods people, <hi>Act. 25. 10. 11. Rom. 13. 1. 2. &amp;c. 1 Pet. 2. 13. 14. 17.</hi> they may lawfully continew under them, have the use and benefit of them: they are all of God, and none of them from the bottomless pit or of the Divil, as is the Beast the Empire of Antichrist, <hi>Rev. 17. 8.</hi> from which God calleth all his people.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> A plaine evasion. The question was about the church of Rome, as before I shewed from his own graunt. To justifie her to be Gods church, he alleaged <hi>2 Thes. 2.</hi> for one proof; <hi>Rev. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> for an other: <hi>Rev. 18. 4.</hi> for a third: and now the state of Israel for a fourth. His other repetitions, I have answered before. I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes distinguished in <hi>Rev. 11.</hi> between the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (the Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) and the <hi>holy citie</hi> and <hi>court,</hi> which they have destroyed &amp; tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under foot, and stil doe. Neyther have I denyed but the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters in Iudah and Israel, were types of Antichristians in part: but this I sayd and still say, that the more full and perfect type of them, is by the holy Ghost shewed us to be in the Sodomites, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians and Babylonians, <hi>Rev. 11. &amp; 17. &amp; 18.</hi> As the Priests of Aaron were types of Christ, but Melchisedek was a more full and perfect type of him; as the Apostle proveth in <hi>Heb. 7.</hi>

               <p>Againe, if that which he striveth for, were granted him, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Israel in apostasie typed out Antichristians; and that Israel was notwithstanding a true church: yet wil it not follow therefore the Antichristian church of Rome, is a true church also. For the apostasie and idolatrie of Rome, is farr greater then Israels, as I have <note n="†" place="margin">Arrow. ag. lolat. ch. 3. &amp; 5.</note> elswhere shewed; and can easily confirme against any that shall gainsay it. 2. Mr. Io. himself maketh <note n="“" place="margin">1 Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab. 1.</note> Antiochus and his captaines, (which were of the worst sort of heathens,) to be types and figures of the Pope and his hierarchie (which are the Bishops priests and Deacons of the church of Rome,) as before we have seen. Yet would he not admitt of this conclusion; therfore the Bishops Priests and Deacons of the church of Rome are heathens; as was Antiochus. So his reasoning for Israel, though it were true; will be no sound proof for Rome. Types, figures and similitudes
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:23010:40"/>
hold in some things, not in all: and it is a very easy thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive men by figures, similies, allegories. But the plaine doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines in the scripture, they are a sure ground: and if any doe wrest a type or similitude against them, it is to be rejected, what colour soever it hath. Now mine opposite reasoneth not from these doctrines; which would soon end the strife. For the scripture plainely sayth, that Antichrist, the man of syn, is the <hi>son of perdition,</hi> and all that beleeve his lyes and folow him are damned. <hi>2 Thes. 2. 3. 10. 11. 12.</hi> That Antichrist is a lyar, denying both the Father and the Son, <hi>1 Ioh, 2. 22.</hi> they that are of God, doe overcome him: they that are of the world, hear him. Hereby is knowen the spirit of trueth, and the spirit of errour; <hi>1 Joh. 4. 3.—6.</hi> They that belong to the Lamb (Christ) on mount Sion, have his Fathers name written on their foreheads, <hi>Rev. 14. 1.</hi> and worship not the beast, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his mark, <hi>Rev. 20. 4.</hi> but they that belong to Antichrist, and have not their names written in the book of life, doe worship the beast, and receive his mark, and shalbe tormented for ever, <hi>Rev. 13. 8. 16. &amp; 14. 9. 10. 11.</hi> But the church of Rome beleeveth Antichrists lyes, worshipeth the Beast and his idols, receiveth his mark, and is partaker of all his abominations. Who now without open inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to the word of God, can make this people the true church of Christ, and in the visible covenant of grace? On the other hand, my Opposites reasons are drawen from that figurative phrase <hi>the Temple of God, 2 Thes. 2.</hi> and the type of apostate Israel; and an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection cast in the way to stumble at, that <hi>else we must be baptised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:</hi> (as if men that can not tell how to avoyd an inconvenience, must run into a mischief; to justifie those whom God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth.) And upon these and the like grounds, are his reasons framed; (as may be seen throughout his work;) with some few props of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authoritie, to undershore them.</p>
               <p>Though this brief answer might serve unto all his discourse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the state of Israel: yet for to help the weak reader, that might stumble at some things layd in his way; I wil annex a few moe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations.</p>

                  <hi>Errours, evasions, contradictions</hi> &amp;c, wherwith he chargeth me, this is 1. <hi>That the Temple of God 2 Thes. 2. 4. is no more Gods temple, then Ieroboams idol temples in Jsrael, and Bels temple in Babylon: yet also J sayd, it was to be understood of Gods church &amp; people invaded and destroyed by Antichrist &amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This his tautologie, I have before answered; and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my self both of errour and contradiction. For that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ should destroy Gods temple and church, I proved by the example of the Babylonians burning the Citie &amp; Temple of God, and captiving his people: and by the measuring of the new buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>Rev. 11.</hi> That this being doen, Antichrist should have an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Temple and church of his own frame, which he should call Gods and Christs; I shewed by the Beast arising from the sea, and from the earth, with hornes like the Lamb (Christ) <hi>Rev. 13.</hi> which beast is a kingdom spiritual or ecclesiastical politie, a <hi>great whore, Rev. 17.</hi> by Antichrist adified, adorned, mainteyned: which stil he pretendeth to be the ancient catholik church, and temple of God.</p>
               <p>Now further for Ieroboam that drew Israel into syn, he <note n="“" place="margin">Chr. plea pag. 161.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that he was a type of Antichrist: though he sheweth not wherin. But Ieroboams syn was in making a new House (or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) and a new altar to sacrifice in unto God, and new priests, with new signes, as Calves to worship God by: <hi>1 King. 12.</hi> In these things then he must be a type of Antichrist: who accordingly (if he answereth to his figure) must erect a new Temple, altar, preist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and signes, differing from Christs, as in deed he hath doen. And that idolatrous house erected for the worship of the true God, not onely the Israelites, but the Prophet Amos, calleth <hi>the house</hi> (that is the Temple) <hi>of their god, Am. 2. 8.</hi> as Paul calleth the house wherin Antichrist sitteth, <hi>the temple of God, 2 Thes. 2.</hi> yet this man blameth me for comparing that Temple with Ieroboams idol temples, which Israel <hi>builded</hi> when he <hi>forgat his Maker, Hos. 8. 14.</hi> how justly, let men of judgment consider.</p>
               <p>2. His 2. exception is about <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the <hi>Beast,</hi> that I make them one with the Church of Rome, and distinguish not Babylon from Sion. This I have before cleared: shewing that the church of Rome is the <hi>whore of Babylon, Rev. 17.</hi> and I distinguish it from Sion, which he confoundeth with Babylon, being himself in that blame which he would impute unto me. And to teach that God calleth us out of any civil state or goverment, I have formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be erroneous and seditious, contrary to the Apostles, <hi>Rom. 13. 1 Pet. 2.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That Antichrists Apostasie and the church of Rome with him, is much worse then Ieroboams and Israels with him; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly affirme: and let the synns of them both be compared, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:23010:41"/>
it wil soon appear. Did Ieroboam pray unto creatures, as the church of Rome doth to innumerable, even all Saincts and Angels, and some mere fictions? Did Ieroboam hold any of those mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold blasphemous heresies now holden in the church of Rome? Nay let the very Babylonians of old be taken: and I wil undertake to prove that the church of Rome is not behinde them, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the light of the Gospel revealed by Christ, much worse.</p>
               <p>4. I grant <hi>that in Pauls time the church of Rome was set in the way of God, and soon after fell into apostasie:</hi> but where he chargeth me to say, that <hi>the ordinances of God stil reteyned in that church are stollen;</hi> he wrongeth me. For I acknowledge not this church now, to be that which was in Pauls time, but a counterfeit, arisen since: a theif, partner with Antichrist, in robbing the church, (as the <note n="†" place="margin">2 King. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If the Babylonians should have repented, and joyned to the church of God at Ierusalem: they there might have had an holy and lawful use of Gods vessels, altars &amp;c, which before they had stollen, and abused: so may these spirituall Babylonians have at this day, if God give them grace to repent, &amp; joyne unto Sion.

               <p>5. He calleth it <hi>my like errour and iniquitie,</hi> to match baptisme and the other ordinances of God in the church of Rome, with the feasts worship and sacrifices of the heathen, who were <note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 2. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I could as easily call his assertions <hi>miserable</hi> and <hi>Papisticall:</hi> but he would take that for no sound conviction.

                  </gap>. I spake not generally of the heathens <hi>feasts, worship</hi> and <hi>sacrifices,</hi> as he would intimate to his reader: but distinctly of those which had been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:23010:42"/>
of God, differing from other of their own devisings. 2. I sayd, the heathens kept Gods ordinance, <hi>as well as Rome with their sacrifice of the Mass.</hi> He telleth his reader, I match <hi>the baptisme</hi> &amp;c in Rome, with <hi>the worship and sacrifices of the heathen.</hi> Is this good dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling so to change my words? But sundry such injuries I must beare. And why may we think, doth he in sted of the Lords supper, (now turned into a Romish mass) put baptisme? But because he think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he hath colour to plead for one sacrament more then for an other. In handling that point of their baptisme, <note n="†" place="margin">Animadv. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>g. 73. 74.</note> I instanced this other seale, our Lords supper; and an other ordinance of God, <hi>Excommunication:</hi> both which he passeth over: yea every where when it cometh in his way, he shunneth it throughout his book, as in this place. He knew well, it was as a red hot yron that would burn his fingers. But of it, we shal speak more, when we come to handle their baptisme. 3. To his reason, I answer: the heathens were in deed without Christ and without God, <hi>Eph. 2.</hi> and so are these Romish Antichristians, or els the Apostle hath not given us a true rule to discerne Antichrist by, that he <hi>denyeth</hi> both <hi>the Father and the Son: 1 Joh. 2. 22.</hi> The hethens reteyned the knowledge of the true God in some mesure, as their writings manifest; and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiped ignorantly the true God whom th'Apostles preached, <hi>Act. 17. 23.</hi> so the Antichristians ignorantly worship the true God whom we preach and beleeve; and as ignorantly (by stocks and stones, and prayers in an unknowen tongue like Parrats) as did the heathens of old. The hethens reteyned a knowledge of Christ the Redeemer, figured in the sacrifices ordeyned of God: so, the Antichristians reteyn a knowledge of Christ in name, and signified in the sacraments; but as impiously doe they abuse them by hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they conferr grace <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> by the work doen, and other iniquities mixed with them, as did the heathens; and by beleeving and worshiping a Christ made of bread, they surpass the heathens in ignorance and idolatrie.</p>
               <p>Finally, had mine opposite read Mr. Bezaes larger annotations on <hi>Eph. 2.</hi> as he read him on <hi>2 Thes. 2.</hi> he might have seen the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristians very litle inferiour to the heathens without God, even in Mr. Bezaes judgment; which yet I suppose he would not have called <hi>miserable and Anabaptisticall,</hi> as he doeth in me.</p>

through the covenant of grace. And so though some conditions of the covenant were broken, both on their part and on Gods, yet they being brought to repentance continued his church. That herein I neyther wrote error, nor contradicted my self, as he would perswade against me. And these things that fell out in Israel on both parts, touching these figurative promises: doe teach us the like touching the spiritual promises of eternal life, if men break concerning them; as in <hi>repentance, faith and holynes,</hi> without which men perish, and shall never see God; <hi>Luke 13. 3.

                  <hi>That J shuffle togither the estates of Jsrael, when they were one body, and when they were rent in two. Also whilest Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael was in the land and presence of the Lord, and when they were cast out of his house and presence. Animadv. p. 88. 89. 90. 91.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. The first is a wrong imputation, as the reader may see in the place of my book by him cited. I there blame him for not distinguishing their estate, when they were one, and when they were rent asunder. And though I pass from one to an other, as I was led by answering him, yet confound I them not. But here he dealeth as in the former point: answereth not my reasons wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I convinced him of misapplying his <hi>diverse respects,</hi> contrary to the words and meaning of the scriptures; and to avoyd if he could his deserved blame, checketh me, but disproveth not what I wrote. Let the reader compare what we both have sayd.</p>
               <p>For the second, I confess I did not so distinctly handle the state of Israel whiles they were in the land, and after when they were put out, as I should and would have doen, had I fore-seen his pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of every leight thing against me. The reason hereof was, that it skilleth not for the point in controversie, (to weet their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision) whether we respect them before they were cast out or after, for they were not circumcised the second time in eyther estate. And this mine opposite himself sheweth even in this his last book, where he dealeth against the Anabaptists. For in his <hi>Chr. plea p. 27. 28.</hi> he sayth, <hi>Circumcision once received in the apostasie of Israel, was not repeated againe at their returning to the Lord, and leaving of their idolatrous wayes</hi> &amp;c: and quoteth among other scriptures, <hi>2 Chron. 30 ch.</hi> and <hi>Ezr. 6. 19. 20. 21.</hi> Of which, the one speaketh of them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in Ezekiahs dayes, whiles the Israelites were in the land: the other of them that had been dispersed among the heathens,

               <p>The Israelites that rent themselves from Iudah, I take to be a false church; and so continued whiles they dwelt in the land. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were dispersed, and were no church.</p>
               <p>The first, I shew thus. The twelve tribes by Gods institution were all one church, both in Moses time when they had the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle among them, and encamped all round about it, in the order set of God, <hi>Num. 2.</hi> and after in the land of Canaan, whiles the Tabernacle stood, &amp; when the Temple was built by Solomon: both which were signes of Gods presence and dwelling with his church. And to keep them in this unitie, he commanded all the men of Israel to come joyntly togither from all parts of the land, three times every yere, to worship him and keep their solemne feasts, in that one place which he should choose: and at all other times to offer their sacrifices there, and in no other place; and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely to bring their first fruits, their commanded and their voluntarie oblations; <hi>Exod. 23. 14.—17. 19. Deut. 12. 5. 6. 7.</hi> Who so did otherweise, <hi>blood</hi> was imputed unto that man, and he should be <hi>cut off from among his people;</hi> to keep the people from offring <hi>their sacrifices unto Divils, Levit. 17. 3. 4. 7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when the ten tribes revolted and made Ieroboam king, then Israel <hi>forgat his maker and builded Temples, Hos. 8. 14.</hi> For Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam <hi>took counsel and made two calves of gold, and sayd unto them; Jt is too much for you to goe up to Jerusalem; Behold thy gods ô Jsrael, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt; and he set the one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan: and this thing became a syn. And he made an house of hye places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sonns of Levi. And he offred on the Altar, which he had made in Bethel. 1 King. 12. 28.—33.</hi> And having cast off the Lords Priests &amp; Levites, Ieroboam <hi>ordeyned him priests for the hie places, and for the Divils and for the calves which he had made:</hi> but such <hi>of all the tribes of Israel, as set their harts to seek the Lord God of Jsrael, went to Jerusalem, to sacrifice unto the Lord God of their fathers: 2 Chron. 11. 14. 15. 16.</hi> Thus of one <note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 9. 14.</note>

               </p>
               <p>From these and other the like testimonies against this people, I gather, that from the time they departed from the Lord, from his Temple, altars and holy signes of his presence with his people in Christ; from his Priests and the lawfull sacrifices at Ierusalem, which were figures of Christ, and from the communion of their brethren the Iewes (which <note n="*" place="margin">Hos. 11. 12.</note> remayned the church of Christ;) and made a new Temple, altar, priesthood and church of humane and synfull institution: that this their church, Temple, preisthood and worship were false.

In their civil state, the Israelites were to be subject unto Nebuchadnezar an heathen, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered them, <hi>Ier.</hi> 27. 6. 8. 12. but for their ecclesiastical estate they might never submitt to Nebuchadnezars church, or priests, nor offer to God upon any of his altars. So to Ieroboam as king they might be subject, without dissolving their communion in the mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of Christ, set in the Temple, altars, priests &amp;c at Ierusalem. Thus this new church and ministerie arising from Ieroboams syn, was not of God; and therfore could not possibly be a true church, which alwayes is a divine ordinance in Christ the head of the same.</p>

And for the Church of Rome, I shewed them to be in comparison with Turks, neerer Christ; and so the doctrine there, neerer to salvation then the Mahometans: and I doubt not but God by it saveth some chosen therein: which yet justifieth not their estate to be a true Christian Church; as the reprobates in the true Church, condemne not the estate thereof.</p>
               <p>I <note n="*" place="margin">Animadv. pag. 94.</note> shewed by many instances, the Church of Rome to be in some things more grosse idolaters then either Iewes or Turkes, or heathens.

That Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom, shal have easier judgement then Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Caperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. Mat. 11. yet these cities were the Churches and people of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> For Ierusalem, the Prophets speak of it sometime as generally wicked; when yet there were many godly, that partaked not with her synns, Ezek. 9. 4. Such as were more openly wicked then Samaria and Sodom, I deny them to be actually then in the covenant of grace to mans judgement; for the Lord appointed them to destruction, Ezek. 9. The cities of Israel in Christs time, were a part of the true Church of the Iewes: yet for refusing Christ, they should have heavier judgement then the heathens: so shall hypocrites in every true Church, have greater punishment then many heathens. But comparison should be made of Church with Church, not of some in the true Church, with the estate of a false church. And that the generall state of the Church of Rome is Antichristian, and so denieth indeed <note n="*" place="margin">1. Ioh. 2. 22</note> both the Father and the Son; is before proved. And they generally these many years, haue been more grosse idolaters then either Iewes or Turks: therefore their profession of Christ in name, will not prove them to be in the covenant of grace. God testifieth to the Churches of Galatia, <hi>Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the Law; ye are fallen from grace, Gal. 5. 4.</hi> If they that would be justified by the Law of God, and works of the same, fell from grace: much more they that will be justified by the law of Antichrist, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:23010:46"/>
workes, are fallen from grace, and have no benefit by Christ. But such is the generall faith of the Church of Rome, beleeving to be justified by the idolatrous workes, which they walk in as they are taught by the Man of Syn, that sitteth as God, in the Temple of God, carrying them to destruction.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I tell them plainly, that that <hi>Temple of God</hi> which the prophets speak of, had no agreement with idols; though the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked set up idols in it by force. But the Church of Rome (which these call the Temple of God) hath agreement with idols, if ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of silver and gold, wood and stone, a wheaten god in the Masse, and the man of syn which sitteth as God, be idols. For these idols the Church of Rome worshipeth and serveth most synfully: but the Temple of God which the Prophets speake of, never worshiped the Idols set up in it, nor had accord with them. But this is a shift of shifts, and a notorious sophisme in mine opposite, to reason from the materiall Temple of God then, which onely suffered that abuse; to the spirituall Temple, the Church or people now, which are voluntary agents, &amp; worshipers of Idols. By which false argumentation he might even as well conclude, that if the Papists should turn flat Pagans of Antiochus religion, and serve his idols, and be of his faith: yet they should continue the true Church and people of God notwithstanding: because the Temple then, continued Gods true Temple, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all that Antiochus did thereto.</p>

Ezek 13. 22.</hi> These and other like things, he passeth over, without word of answer. It is ynough for him to cry, the Temple of God, the Temple of God; and to insist upon phrases which may diversly be understood.

And who, that seeketh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the truth, would not rather insist upon these main grounds taught by our Saviour and his Apostles? Verily, I judge this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for Rome, to be an exceeding great sin; because it by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence overthroweth both faith and holines: seeing misbeleevers and most synfull idolaters as ever were on earth, are justified to be Gods true Church notwithstanding, and in his covenant of grace, contrary to the whole Testament of Christ. It is to make a wide gate and broad way into heaven, and will make men secure in all syn: if they that serve the Man of syn himselfe, worship his idols, beleeve in his heresies, and walk in his wicked works, which hope to merit salvation by them in heaven: may be sayd to be true Christians, and in the state of grace.</p>

For such large Churches as he describeth, I hold all nations to be, when God made his speciall covenant with Israel. <hi>Noe</hi> was a Christian, and had the covenant of grace in Christ to him and to his seed, as absolutely as any Christian Church in the Apostles dayes: though the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Gospel was not then so clearly revealed * as it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward<note place="margin">† <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25. 26.</note> by the Apostles.

Yea let any shew, that any of the heathens (I except not the very Canaanites,) turned the sacrifices into such abominable idolatry, as the Church of Rome hath tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the sacraments. And for other synns, Antichristians are not behinde them. How freely did <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jakob</hi> live and publickly worship God by altars and sacrifices, in the midst of the

Yea God himself ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto that King, and appointed Abraham to pray for him, Gen. 20. 3.—7. How honourably did the Hittites intreat Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, acknowledging him a Prince of God, and offred him all kindnes, Gen. 23. 5. 6. &amp;c. yet other nations were better then they, Gen. 24. 3. 4. &amp; 27. 46. Look upon Balaam the soothsayer of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopotamia, even in Moses time: and see how he consulted with <hi>Jehovah his God,</hi> by altars and sacrifices of Burnt-offrings, such as were used in Israel, Num. 22. 8. 9. 18. &amp; 23. 1. 2. 3. &amp;c. and it will plainly appeare, the heathens had not more degenerated from the religion &amp; worship learned from <hi>Noe,</hi> then the Church of Rome, hath from that which Paul taught there. Yea there was a better Church in the land of Vz (in all likelihood,) then the Church of Israel was in Aegypt, when they polluted themselves with the idols thereof, Ezek. 20. 6. 7. 8.

And wheras those nations had not the word of God written, but as they learned it by voyce of men, which might more easily be corrupted and forgotten: the church of Rome having the written word, hath despised it; not suffered their children to read or heare it, lest (forsooth) it should make them heretickes: that for a man to have Gods booke, it was as much as his life was worth: so the miserable people, for contempt of Gods holy Law, have been justly given over into Aegyptian darknes, and into most abominable idolatries and heresies, which have drowned men in perdition.</p>
               <p>Now that which mine opposite objecteth of the opinion of the Anabaptists, &amp;c. as I reject it for a great errour; so his supposition whereby he would feoff it upon me, is injurious: <hi>If I think that all people of the world in all ages and places of the earth, are under the covenant of grace, &amp;c.</hi> whereas I spake but of the nations in Moses time, which were not so farr fallen from God, as they were afterward, and now much more.

The heathens then were not more fallen from God, then the church of Rome is: mine opposite pleadeth for Rome, because they were a church 15 hundred yeeres before, and Antichrist still sitteth in the Temple of God. I answer him, the heathens in Moses time were all the church nine or ten hundred yeares before, and are still called Gods people, <hi>Exod. 19. 5.</hi> He replieth, with the instance of <hi>Wild-beasts, &amp;c.</hi> If I should so have turnd my back upon an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what out-cries would he have made after me?</p>

When Moses sayth, <hi>All the earth</hi> was of one language, <hi>Gen 11. 1.</hi> doth not he mean it of the men of the earth onely, and not of beasts?

love made Israel his peculiar, above all other peoples: though some of the Nations were (as in charitie I judge from Iobs histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,) Gods true churches stil; and in the worst of the nations (as the cursed Canaanites) he had many of his elect, (as he hath now in the church of Rome;) which the examples of Rahab the harlot, the Gibeonites or Nethinims, Vriah the Hittite, Aravnath the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busite; and many other throughout the scriptures, doe confirme. All men (as th'Apostle teacheth from the heathens confession) are Gods <hi>ofspring</hi> (or <hi>generation,</hi>) <hi>Act. 17. 28. 29.</hi> The Gentile (as the parable shewerh in Luke 15) was brother to the Iew; and God is the God not of the Iewes onely, but also of the Gentiles, <hi>Rom. 3. 29.</hi> and if the uncircumcised Gentile kept the righteousnes of the Law, his uncircumcision was counted for circumcision, for there is no respect of persons with God, <hi>Rom. 2. 10. 11. 26.

Whence did Cain and Abel, Noe, Abram, Iakob and Iob; learn to offer first fruits, and beasts, build altars, pay tithes, make vowes &amp;c: but from divine institution taught their fathers from God, and by the fathers to the children? Otherweise they could not have doen them in faith, as of some of them th'Apostle testifieth they did, <hi>Heb. 11.</hi> which teacheth us so to judge of the rest. And if all other nations had kept the faith as did Iob; their sacrifices had been the seales of forgivenes of synns unto them, as they were <note n="†" place="margin">Iob. 1. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

From whence I pray you drew the Paynims all their ceremonies, but from the holy Fathers? The mischief was, that they corrupted that which was wel instituted of God.

                  <hi>Not Rome, but the Church: and not this Church, but that which then was, nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the Apostles times, which cleaved to the truth and simplicitie of Christ. The disputer would deceive, ex elenchi ignoratione.</hi> Into the same fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie doth mine opposite often run, in his dispute against me: and is therefore reproved by Mr. Iunius himselfe.</p>
               <p>To the objection of Gods calling in the Church of Rome; bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmed without proof: I shewed from 2. Thes. 2. that the man
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:23010:52"/>
of syn sitteth there, calling all to worship him, &amp;c. and from <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. that God calleth <hi>out of her, such as shal bee saved</hi> And from <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. that their Bishops (the ordinary meanes of calling) are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from heaven, and have the key of the bottomless pit, &amp;c. which Mr. Iunius himselfe hath applied to the popish hierarchie. Mine opposite replieth, <note n="†" place="margin">Chr. plea pag. 188.</note> that I <hi>had not what to answer,</hi> but <hi>boldly deny that God is there calling as in his Church, &amp;c.</hi> In sted of disproving, hee fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to his wonted questioning: <hi>how then there can be salvation to any in that church, &amp;c. Answ.</hi> It is a wearines to answer his often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Salvation by sundry meanes cometh to Gods elect in all false churches, and in the world. How came Rahab to faith among the Canaanites? Heb. 11. 31. Iam. 2. 25. and other Gods chosen among the heathens. It is one thing for God to call by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie means; another thing for him to call <hi>as in his church,</hi> by his ordinary ministerie, which is the thing that I deny in Rome, and they prove it not there.</p>
               <p>The distinction between the papacie and the church of Rome; that is, the pastors and the flock of that church; is of no weight to prove the difference pretended: unlesse they were of divers faiths and religions. But when the priests teach lies, idolatries and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies; and the people beleeve, worship and obey them, (as they doe in Rome,) they both perish together, as the scriptures witnes 2. Thess. 2. Rev. 14. 9. 10. 11.</p>
               <p>Touching the <hi>order</hi> or <hi>rank of Apostates</hi> (to omit his trifling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his own translation of the word) he <note n="*" place="margin">Chr. plea pag. 190.</note> sayth <hi>Mr. Junius speaks this not of the whole Church, but onely of the papal hierarchie.</hi> Be it so: but what proof is brought for that he sayth. It is knowen to all that have understanding of their estate, that the church and people of Rome are apostate from the faith and service of Christ, as are their priests and hierarchie. What shall I need to bring proofes? Mr. Iohnson himselfe here confesseth, and <note n="†" place="margin">Chr. plea pag. 120.</note> 
                  <hi>prayeth all to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of it, that the Church of Rome, <hi>is fallen into most sinful and deep defection and Apostasie; and so is a notorious harlot and idolatress.</hi> If Mr. Iunius say otherweise, and will have the Apostasie to be in the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie onely, not in the church: let them first agree between themselves, before they trouble others with their contrary pleas. Or let a third be umpier beeween them: Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> who (in his second Replie to D. Whitgift, pag. 245.) sayth; <hi>J would gladly learn where the Lord hath willed us so to cast away the use of our iudgement,</hi>

                  <hi>that when men make open profession, that they are members of the Pope, which is Antichrist; yet we must account of them as of members of Christ. Or how this is to iudge wisely,</hi> Ioh. 7. 14.</p>
               <p>Wheras Mr. Iunius made the <hi>papacie,</hi> or <hi>papal hierarchie</hi> to be <hi>an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident growing to the Church, apoyson in the church, a pestilence, a dropsie, a gangrene in the body.</hi> I shewed these inconveniences upon their own grant, <hi>If the hierarchie be no part of the body, but an accident, a poyson, a gangrene, &amp;c. what shal we think of al the actions of that hierarchy, their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, making of ministers, &amp; whole church administration? They ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not possibly be the actions of the body, of the church, neither of Christ, &amp;c. And now what is become of their true baptisme, and ordination of mini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sters? And how doth God cal in that Church, as before they reasoned? &amp;c.</hi> Here mine opposite chargeth me <note n="*" place="margin">Chr. plea pag. 191.</note> with <hi>trifling and cavilling, &amp;c. as if similitudes should hold in all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> A similitude must hold in some things, and in that for which it is alleaged; else it is vaine: to prove the hierarchie none of the Church, this instance is brought, the pestilence, dropsie, gangrene, is none of the body, but an accident. To disprove this, I shew that such accidents can doe no natural functions of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: but the hierarchie doe the naturall functions of the body of the church of Rome, in teaching, ministring the sacraments, &amp;c. therefore they are not accidents, but true members, yea the chiefe of that Church.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>The Apostate Jewes are compared to brass and iron, Jer. 6. 28. Ezek. 22. 18. Shal we now conclude against Iudah, to make a nullity of all the actions, ministration, and Churches estate?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is a living body that doth actions, and not mettall: if a similie bee given of a living body, and of a gangrene or scab that consumes the life of that body; all in reason will see, that the body doth actions, the scab or gangrene doth none. But in a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude from metall, there is no reason to speak of actions. But thus, the whole company is compared to a lump of metall: the godly are as pure <hi>silver,</hi> Psal. 66. 10. the wicked are as <hi>dross.</hi> Psalm. 119. 119. the fire of Gods word, and tribulation, trieth them, 1. Pet. 1, 6. 7. The Finer reserveth the pure metall, but consumeth or casteth away the drosse: thus God threatneth to doe with the Iewes, Ezek. 22. 18.—22. Here to bring in actions of a living body, is quite from the purpose; but in the other similie not. Here I would say, of drosse can be no vessell for the Finer: or, of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:23010:53"/>
                  <hi>brass, yron,</hi> and <hi>reprobate silver,</hi> the Lord maketh no choyce for ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels in his sanctuary. Of like sort are his other wrested similitudes of <hi>trees, corne, seed, &amp;c.</hi> all which must bee fitted to their proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>But vvhat answer giveth he to the poynt it self? First, he break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out into his charitable termes, saying, <hi>Could any Anabaptist write more Anabaptistically then thus, &amp;c.</hi> And after sundry reproches, he replieth in Mr. Iunius name, and to my question, <hi>Can a scab or gangrene perform any action of a natural body or member?</hi> hee giveth no answer, but asketh againe, <hi>Can a body that hath a scab or gangrene, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme no actions of a natural body?</hi> I answer; yes, it can. And vvhat now will it help his cause? For though the body can doe the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall actions of it: yet it is not possible for the scab or gangrene to doe them. Either therefore the Pope and his hierarchie must be other then accidents, gangrenes, poyson, dropsie, &amp;c. in the church of Rome (as in deed they are the chiefe members of that Whore) or else they can performe no ecclesiasticall action. As for his usuall refuge (when all other faile) <hi>the baptisme</hi> had in Rome, we shall speak of it in due place. Onely let it here be observed, that this baptisme is there administred by such as are not of the body or Church, (by their own graunt,) but by <hi>ulcers, gangrenes, &amp;c.</hi> And Mr. Iunius himselfe answering Bellarmine, so urgeth it; saying of the <hi>Man of Syn</hi> (the popish Hierarchie) <note n="*" place="margin">Animadv. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>he is not properly of the Temple, for the ulcer</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is not of the body, though it be in the body.</hi> So I straine not the similitude beyond the due proportion, if Mr. Iunius his owne reasoning be good.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Of Himenaeus and Philetus it is sayd, their word did eat as a gangrene, 2. Tim. 2. 17. 18. would he then conclude, that the baptisme mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred by them was not true baptisme? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, it is not sayd of the men, but of their doctrine, that <hi>their word</hi> fretted as a gangrene; but Mr. Iunius maketh the very men, ulcers and gangrenes, <hi>in the body,</hi> but not <hi>of it.</hi> If the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers or members of a church teach heresie, that doctrine is as a gangrene; but the persons teaching them are truly officers or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that church, though synfull. But in Rome, the officers are ulcers, <hi>not of the body,</hi> in his account: so his example is not fit. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if they were by the Apostle <hi>delivered to Satan,</hi> as is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by <hi>1 Tim. 1. 20.</hi> then they and their folowers were no true Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church, but a synagogue of Satan, to be reckned among the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:23010:53"/>
Antichrists, <hi>1 Joh. 2. 18. 19.</hi> and so could not administer true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an baptisme, to their disciples.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Where he againe denyeth any calling to be in the church of Rome, and asketh, How God doth call in that church, let him ask it of such of his followers, as have heretofore been of the Priests and members of that church &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. He againe wrongeth me (as too often,) saying that I deny <hi>any calling to be in that church:</hi> it never entred into my hart. I hold there is some calling in the churches of Turks and Iewes, much more, in false Christian churches. I denyed that <hi>God is there calling as in his church,</hi> which they plead for: that is, God hath not there his ordinary true ministers, but Antichrists hierarchie doth call the people from God. How be it, by some whom God raiseth up of ministers or people, his witnesses whom that church murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>Rev. 11. 3. 7.</hi> and by reading the scriptures and other writings, God calleth his people out of that Babylon. Witness the late Archbishop <hi>Marcus Antonius de Dominis,</hi> who <note n="*" place="margin">In Consil. sue Profect.</note> testifieth, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out persuasion counsel or advise of any man of what sort so ever; he was, by reading the scriptures and Fathers, drawen to mislike and forsake that Roman church. And thus among Turks, Iewes, heathens, I doubt not but God calleth some from them by the light of his word and spirit. Yea not onely in the church of Rome, but by it and the ministerie of it, God calleth his elect: for as the Apostles doctrine in the true church, was to the reprobates <hi>the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi>

                  <hi>considered, and the hierarchie growen in that church upon it, himself could best have shewed. This here is evident, that in one respect he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the hierarchie to be an order or estate of apostasie in the church, an accident &amp;c. in an other respect, he esteemeth the ministery of Gods holy things to be there, though exceedingly corrupted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. By such differences and distinctions mine opposite would cary us from the trueth, that I say not from common reason. For he granteth the church it self, the people, to be exceedingly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, with <hi>most synfull and deep defection and apostasie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> yet in another respect to be the temple, the people of God. Now we have the like for the Bishops and Priests, in one respect an order of apostasie, in an other, Gods ministerie. Wherfore then have we been led a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with distinctions, of the ministerie or hierarchie, from the church, the one to be the Man of syn, the son of perdition, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be the Temple of God? The plaine way should have been thus, The Ministers and people of Rome, are in one respect an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postatical church, in an other a faithfull church; in one respect the synagogue of Satan; in an other, the Temple of God. But eyther my judgment faileth me, or Mr. Iunius driveth at an other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; let men of understanding minde his writing.</p>
               <p>Further I answer, by like distinction, we are to put difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Angels that synned, or synfull men, <hi>simply considered</hi> as Gods creatures, and the poyson of syn which as an accident is growen upon them: and this is true. But shall that their being Gods creatures, free them from damnation which that poyson, that accident syn hath brought upon them? No man of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge wil so say, Even so, the Man of syn, the Pope, hierarchie &amp; people of the church of Rome, which are all in apostasie from the faith of Christ, and service of God; can not in that estate be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heyres of salvation, (except God turne them againe to Christ,) for the scripture hath given sentence of their damnation, <hi>2 Thes. 2. 3. 10. 11. 12.</hi>

                  <hi>Might he not also thus conclude against Iudah in Apostasie, that God did not cal that Church, nor any in it, or by any of them in that estate, alleaging</hi> Ier. 5. 30. 31. &amp; 6. 28. 29. 30.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is denyed: for this is not that church, but an other harlot arisen since, falsly boasting to be the same. 2.

                  </gap>0<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Pope hath still the same faith that the people hath, his mariage standeth as well as theirs. 3. The Scripture sheweth like mariage with the churches of Ephesus, Philippi, Thessalonica, and many other; which have revolted to Mahomet, as Rome hath to the Man of syn: so then we must account those Churches still maried unto Christ, by the same record. But they will deny those churches to continue the mariage; so doe I this. Besides, if he had considered the scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19 7. 8. he might have seen a new mariage between Christ and his Church: which needed not have been, if the former mariage had continued undissolved, as he supposeth.</p>

                  <hi>a notorious harlot and idolatress,</hi> I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend. Some that are dazeled, may think one thing to be two or three: I find in Rev. 17. but one notorious harlot Babylon; if they grant that she was never maried to Christ, it is all that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire. That Israel (the twelve tribes) was maried to Christ, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ten of them became an harlot, and <note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 3. 8.</note> was divorced, I grant: and so her adulterous sister Iudah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> afterward. The same I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for the churches of Rome, Corinth, Ephesus, &amp;c. But since they were divorced from Christ, and maried to Mahomet, and Antichrist; there remaineth no more record of their former mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; ill they returne again to the Lord, out of Babylon unto Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem the holy citie, which is <hi>prepared as a Bride, adorned for her husband, Rev.</hi> 21. 2.</p>
               <p>Of my next words, mine opposite maketh a wonderment. <hi>But it exceedeth all</hi> (sayth <note n="†" place="margin">Chr. plea pag. 196</note> he) <hi>that he blusheth not to aske, where is the record that Christ was ever maried to the beast that came up from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomless pit?

                  <hi>Beast! Did Mr. Junius ever say so? Or thinks he that ever it entred into his thought? Did not Mr. Junius speak expresly of the Church? Wil this man never learne to put difference between the Beast and the Church? between the Man of syn and the Temple of God? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It seemeth that his wonder made him to forget him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Sayd he not even now, it was <hi>evident</hi> that Mr. <hi>Iunius in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect acknowledged the Hierarchy to be an order or estate of apostasie in the Church; and in another respect he esteemed the ministery of Gods holy things to be there?</hi> So then, though the Hierarchy onely be the <hi>Beast</hi> (as mine opposite thinketh) and though in respect of the Apostasie it is not maried to Christ, yet in respect as it is Gods ministerie, though corrupted, it is maried to Christ. But behold how their doctrines are admirable to themselves. The ministers of the Church of Rome, are of the same religion, faith and holines with the people: the people hee will have to bee still maried to Christ; but the ministers in no weise; he cannot endure to heare of it; especially when it cometh under the scripture names of the <hi>Man of syn,</hi> or the <hi>Beast.</hi> And where he asketh if I <hi>wil never learn to put difference between the Beast and the Church, &amp;c.</hi> I doe put diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, though not so great as he would have me: for the <hi>Beast,</hi> and the <hi>whore</hi> that rideth him, Rev. 17. though they differ, yet are they so neerly conjoyned, that if one be maried to Christ, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is also. But why doth he not teach from the scriptures what the Beast signifieth? I have learned from the Prophet Daniel, that a <hi>Beast,</hi> meaneth a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> Dan. 7. 23. and a kingdom by light of reason consisteth of King and subjects, of governours and people; and Mr. Iunius himselfe telleth us so, saying, <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>A kingdom is a multitude of men gathered under one King.</hi> As the Christian kingdom therefore consisteth of Christ, his ministers, and people: so doth the Antichristian, of Antichrist, his ministers and people.

                  <hi>otherwise then all the world was by our first parents Adam and Noe: how then hath she broken the covenant of wedlock if she never were in it? how can she be called a whore in respect of Christ, any more then the heathens, that never knew God in Christ?

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Of the state of the Gentiles I have spoken before; and proved them to have been all in the covenant of grace in Christ: from Gen. 9. 9. &amp;c. But they generally fell from God to idolatry, (which is whoredom) and apostasie: and were in time rejected of God: who renewed his covenant with one small nation of the Iewes, and yet saved his elect among the Gentiles also. So the Christian Churches planted by the Apostles, soon fell from God, and in time were rejected of God; some given over to Mohome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, some to poperie. Yet God hath preserved his litle Church, fled into the wildernesse, Rev. 12. and saved his elect also in false Churches. I compare these not with the Gentiles at this day, but with the Gentiles before Christs comming, whiles sacrificing was lawfull; as I am taught of God, Rev. 11. and 17. and 18. with the old Babylonians &amp; Aegyptians. In those times Tyrus was an harlot, Esa. 23. 16. Niniveh was an harlot, Nahum. 3. 4. and so other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons then by like equitie were harlots: and Rome likewise at this day. Who knoweth not, that a woman which is divorced from her husband, (as Israel was <note n="*" place="margin">Ier. 3.</note> from God,) for whordome, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that trade still; may still be called a harlot? I deny not, but in a large kind of speech, Rome at this day, may be sayd to have been once maried to Christ, in respect of the Christian church that once was there: but so all the Gentiles were in respect of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with Noe. Neither doubt I to say, that the Iewes even now do goe a whoring from their God; for <note n="†" place="margin">Deut. 32.</note> Moses and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets so speake of them, yet actually there is now no covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and them.

               <p>About my answer for the godly fathers of the Iewes, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked fathers of these Antichristians, which the holy Ghost maketh to be <hi>Gentiles, Sodomites Egyptians</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 2. 8. 18. he sayth <note n="*" place="margin">Chr. plea pag. 199.</note> 
                  <hi>If J mean this of the citie of Rome, J speak not to the point: if of the church of Rome; then</hi> he objecteth <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 3. <hi>thy father was an Amorite &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. His distinction between the citie and church of Rome, serveth him in no sted. It was true in Pauls time, when the citie was heathen, and a Christian church in it. But now the city is Christian Rome, the Empire is an ecclesiastical empire, as I shewed before from Mr. Iunius own grant.</p>
               <p>The Amorites were not those fathers for whose sake the Iewes are loved: but Abraham Isaak and lakob, out of whose loynes the Iewes naturally came. But this church of Rome now, is not the child of that primitive church, eyther in nature or in grace. In place she succedeth them, and so the Mahometists in place succeed other Christian churches planted by th Apostles. And in pretence she is the same Christian church; but as Satan in pretence is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light.</p>
               <p>But <hi>the strangers</hi> (sayth he) <hi>that came to Jsrael, in times of sinceritie or of apostasie, were of the church of Jsrael as well as the Iewes, though not of the same natural posteritie.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 30. 25. 5. 6. 7. <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 29. <hi>Num.</hi> 9. 14.</p>
               <p>Answ. But the strangers that wasted Israel, and dwelt by force in their land, though they were taught how they should fear the Lord, by a Priest, yet were not that church, of whom Moses wrote: 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 24. 27. 28. So the Gothes, Vandals, Saracens, &amp;c which overcame Italie Spaine &amp;c and dwelt there, though the priest of Rome taught them his religion, are not the ancient church, of whom Paul wrote. Besides, he hath streyned things too farr: for diverse Christians are at this day apostate and become Iewes: can we say of them, as Paul doth of the natural Iewes, <hi>As touching the election, they are beloved for the Fathers, Rom.</hi> 11. 28. I understand that speech, of the Iewish nation in generall, not of particulars which perish through unbeleef; as also of the natural Iewes, (who refused the gospel for the time, and stil doe;) and not to concerne their proselytes, which they beget to their apostasie. For there is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:23010:58"/>
regard to the Iewes, because they were <hi>natural branches,</hi> though now broken off; as th'Apostle sheweth <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 21 24.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>The many changes of the Romane state, and troubles by the Gothes, Uandals, &amp;c: these specially concerne the Romane state touching the citie &amp; Empire &amp;c: wheras our question is onely of the church of Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. As the state of the Empire is changed, yet in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect is the same, for <hi>the Beast was, and is not, and yet is, Rev.</hi> 17. 18. so is the church, and ministerie therof; it was, and is not, and yet is. A man may speak to the Bishop of Rome now, as Ezekiel did to the heathen king of Tyre, <hi>Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God, &amp;c. Ezek.</hi> 28. 13. to weet in his predecessor Huram, which had been a proselyte in the church of Israel, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. as the Hebrewes R. D. Kimchi &amp; Sol. Iarchi upon Ezek. 28. and some Christian wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe expound it. So I may say to the Pope, Thou hast been a Christian Bishop, a starr in Christs right hand; because such was the Bishop of Rome in Paules time. But mine opposite himself holdeth the Pope and his hierarchie now to be the <hi>Man of syn,</hi> the <hi>son of perdition,</hi> and thought it most strange in me, that I should ask when ever Christ was maried to that Beast. Now it is as strange, that hee pleadeth for the whore of Babylon, the Antichristian church. He would exclude the hierarchie or ministerie, because of their apostasie; I also for the same doe exclude the church; for the preists and people of Rome are of one faith and religion; if the one be cut off from Christ, so is the other. It can not be denyed but they all have the mark of the Beast upon them; for to take Mr. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius own exposition, The marke of the beast (sayth <note n="*" place="margin">Annot. on Rev. 13. 16.</note> he) is <hi>their Chrisme,</hi> by which in their <hi>sacrament of Confirmation, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>He cannot shew that ever the church of Rome, ceased to be, since it was first planted, but it hath continued stil eyther in sinceritie or apostasie even to this day. Nor can he shew that the Lord hath yet put them out of his covenant, or given thm a bill of divorse, or that they have lest off to baptise in his name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. Neyther can he shew that the Ministerie ever ceased in that church, but hath stil continued eyther in synceritie or aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie: or that the Lord put the ministers out of his covenant, or that they have left off to baptise in Christs name. Yet he now excludeth
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:23010:58"/>
the ministers from being Christs, he makes them <hi>Antichrist,</hi> the <hi>Beast,</hi> the <hi>Man of sin,</hi> the <hi>son of perdition, &amp;c.</hi> and is offended that I should speak of their mariage with Christ. And Mr. Iunius ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them <hi>accidents, ulcers,</hi> and no members of the body; as we have seen. 2. Neither can he shew that the churches of the Gentiles ceased to be after their first planting, Gen. 9. but continued still either in sincerity or apostasie, even till the Apostles time; and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed still unto God, and in his name. Let him shew when old Babylon was divorced from God: and it wil as soon appeare that this new Babylon is divorced also.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>The Papists plead that Rome standeth not where it did on the seven hills: and the Pope sits on the other side the river, on the hil Uatic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Is this a fit comparison, the change of place, and the change of religion? If it be, then as a man going from England to India, is the same man still: so if hee goe from the religion in England, to the religion of the Indians, which is Paganisme, he is of the same religion that he was still. Or, to keep neerer the poynt in hand, the Bishop of Rome at this day, notwithstanding al chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his faith and state since the Apostles time, is a true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Bishop still: then he is not Antichrist, the Man of syn spoken of in 2. Thess. 2. as mine opposite sayth he is.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Many of those people that made the invasions, became Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians themselves, and so the Church was increased. Not to speak how the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry catalogue of the Bishops of the Church of Rome giveth evidence against him. Or wil he say, that though there were Bishops of that Church, yet there was not a church whereof they were Bishops?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> So, many of the Babylonians, Cuthims, &amp;c. that inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Israel, were taught the manner of the God of Israel, and feared the Lord, and had Priests of Israel, which sacrificed for them, 2, King. 17. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

How great partialitie is this in men, to magnifie the people for their faith and religion, and to despise the Bishops and ministers, that are the chiefe teachers and maintainers of the same faith &amp; religion, making them accidents, hang-bies, scabs, ulcers, gangrenes, and all that bad is. So his questions of the time when the Church ceased, are answered with the like, when the ministery ceased? Let the yeare be named when the true Christian ministery was abolished out of the church of Rome, and Antichrist the Man of syn come in the place: &amp; I will answer, in the same year, the people that were fallen with him to the same idolatries, heresies, and to worship him as God in the Temple of God; ceased to bee the true Christian Church, and became a synagogue of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</p>

Whosoever will bring them both to the triall, it will soon appeare; but this triall mine opposite every where shunneth.

But it is well, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dwelling in the place, nor being of the naturall posterity, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sure proofe that a people continueth a church.

Where he maketh <hi>Gods ceasing to cal it back</hi> a signe of the churches ceasing: first, it is barely sayd, without proofe. Secondly, it is obscure what calling back he meaneth. For take the thousand yeare after Christ, and see what calling back had Rome. Was it by her owne ministery or hierarchy?

Did God cease to call back those heretikes and schismatikes? Were there not many learned Doctors that disputed and wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them: by whose meanes God still called them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? Or did God take the Scriptures out of those heretikes hands: when they from them and by them pleaded for their here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies? Thus the rule which Mr. Iunius hath given us for the church of Rome, agreeth not with himself. And if those heretical churches
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:23010:60"/>
were not <hi>Christian,</hi> but <hi>Antichristian</hi> synagogues: then is the church of Rome much more, which worshipeth the greatest Antichrist, the man of syn, and denyeth the foundation of Christian religion, beleeving as the Pope beleeveth, who either denyeth the Father and the Son, or els he is not the Antichrist, 1. Ioh. 2. 22. And that the Apostle meaneth not onely of open and direct denyall, but of indirect and denying in deed when by word he professeth Christ, Mr. Iunius himselfe, D. Whitakers, Mr. Brightman and others (that have answered Bellarmines 14. chap. <hi>de Rom. Pontif. l. 3.</hi>) doe soundly prove. Now as the Pope denyeth Christ, so doth the Whore of Babylon, the Romish church, holding the same here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and idolatries: that if the Pope bee Antichrist, then is the church of Rome an Antichristian synagogue, and not the true church of Christ.</p>
               <p>By this also mine opposites insultation <note n="†" place="margin">Chr. plea p. 202. 203.</note> against me, as if I wrote errors and contradictions unreconcileable touching apos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate churches, is taken away. For as I never denyed, but some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postate churches continued true churches, till the candlestick was removed for their impenitencie; so neither could he, nor can any truely deny, but some apostate churches are mere synagogues of Satan: as those Antichrists mentioned 1.

he shunneth this, and would have me speak of their baptisme. As if the Lords Supper were not as holy as Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.

               <p>Answ. There he laboured to prove it not death in syn, but death civilly, by overthrow of their estate. But that (say I) though it were true of Israel, cannot be the meaning here: for this speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of their estate, whiles Antichrist the Beast and his kingdom li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth reigneth and triumpheth, killing the saincts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 4. 5. so

that he and his church is not dead civilly, that is, his kingdom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, not overthrowen all this while. Secondly God speaketh here of such a death, as is opposed to the <hi>first resurrection,</hi> vers. 5. but the first resurrection is from syn, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 13. &amp; 3. 1. and it is here sayd to be such, as they that have part therin, <hi>the second death hath no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on such, Rev.</hi> 20 6. but if it be but a rising from civil death, or destruction of an outward state, they should not by it be freed from <hi>the second death,</hi> which is due to such onely as rise not from death of syn. So this his answer is impertinent. Besides, even Mr. Iunius himself <note n="*" place="margin">Annot. on Rev. 20. 5.</note> expoundeth it of them that <hi>lye dead in syn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Jf this death</hi> (sayth he) <hi>be, as some think, the apostasie spoken of</hi> 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>we must then remember withall, that this apostasie is in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, vers.</hi> 4. <hi>like as there was apostasie in Iudah and Jsrael heretofore: and that difference is to be put between Gods Temple and the apostasie it self. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. I have shewed, that this death (Mr. Iunius also assenting) must needs here be understood of death in syn, or in Apostasie, if so he wil have it named. Wheras after his manner he compareth it with th'Apostasie of Iudah and Israel, the holy Ghost (as we have heard) compareth it with Babylon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. But if he grant the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie in Israel, was death in syn, it wil help him nothing: for what people soever is dead in syn, they are not actually Gods visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble church, til they be <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 8. 8. - 11.</note> raysed in Christ. I grant him a difference between <hi>Gods Temple</hi> and the <hi>Apostasie:</hi> for if by the Temple he mean the people of God free from apostasie, such in deed are not dead: but the people of Rome now are in apostasie, and have been long; and by the sentence of God, are <hi>dead</hi> in syn and apostasie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therfore they are not those <note n="“" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. 5.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The words of the Scripture are these, <hi>But the rest of the dead lived not againe, until the thousand yeares were finished: this is the first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, Rev.</hi> 20. 5.

They are onely the reprobate multitude which are damned and dead for ever. Many of that church, yea even of the hierarchie, (whom my opposite holdeth to bee the <hi>Man of syn, the son of perdition</hi>) being dead in their sins, God hath in mercie revived and raised with Christ, as he did in the churches of the Gentiles, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

wherein, as his manner is, he drepraveth both my words and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

               <head>Of the Baptisme in the Church of Rome.</head>
               <p>ALthough the former things against the Church of Rome, be ynough to disprove her baptisme, which is ordained of God onely for his Church, and those in his covenant, out of which Rome is gone: yet because mine opposite urgeth some speciall reasons against mee, for the same; I will also briefly answer them.</p>
               <p>About this poynt, he hath nine reasons; in his <hi>Christian plea, pag.</hi> 27...30.</p>
               <p>1. The first, which is against the repeating of Baptisme againe: I grant him: neither doe I hold it needfull or lawfull to repeate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the baptisme received in false churches.</p>
               <p>2. The second, being for the same purpose, I likewise grant. As also, <hi>that there is one baptisme, as there was one circumcision:</hi> which plea of his, I would have noted, because of his contrary reasoning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward. Likewise his example from Israel, whose circumcision was not repeated; I hold very fit. But let the Reader observe, how the Scriptures by him brought to prove it, are 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. chap. &amp; <hi>Ezr.</hi> 6. 19. 20. 21. of which the first was before the captivity, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after.</p>
               <p>3. The third, that the covenant of grace is everlasting, is also true: but should have this addition, taught of the holy Ghost, <hi>To such as keep his covenant, &amp; that remember his commandements to do them: Psal.</hi> 103. 17. 18. For, <hi>if we deny him, he also wil deny us,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12. That God hath regard to his covenant in Apostaticall churches and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, is also true: but barely by him set down, without shewing how. That Moses teacheth us in Levit. 26. namely, that the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites for their apostasie and forsaking of God, <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 16—28.</note> should be chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and if they would not amend, they should at last be <note n="*" place="margin">v. 33.</note> scattred among the heathen, and <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 38.</note> perish among them: and they that are left, <note n="†" place="margin">v. 39. 40.</note> if they confesse their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and if their <note n="*" place="margin">v. 41.</note> uncircumcised hearts be humbled, &amp;c. <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 42.</note> then God will remember his covenant with Iakob, and <note n="†" place="margin">v. 44.</note> will not cast them away, nor abhorr them, to destroy them utterly, to breake his covenant with them; but <note n="*" place="margin">v. 45.</note> will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors.</p>
               <p>4. The fourth, of Christs dying once, and our being once
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:23010:65"/>
baptised: I also grant.</p>
               <p>5. The fift, that the Church of Rome was espoused to Christ, and had his baptisme in the Apostles dayes: is true. But where he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that she hath <hi>ever since reteined it, with other grounds of Christian religion;</hi> there he goeth too farr. For many grounds of Christian religion she hath forsaken: as all that are not Papists will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Wherefore he addeth a qualification, <hi>either for faith, or order, or both, in whole or in part.</hi> This is so large as will bring in, not onely the heathens of old, but all the old condemned heretickes in the Apostles dayes and after, yea even the very Iewes and Turkes at this day. For <hi>in part</hi> they retein the grounds of Christian religion. It is a ground of Christian religion to beleeve that there is one God: and that the very Divils (as the Apostle sayth) doe beleeve, Iam. 2. 19. But not to goe so farr, as I grant him that the Papists in baptisme retein Christs ordinance <hi>in whole or in part;</hi> so he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but also in the Lords Supper (now turned to an abominable ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Masse,) they reteyn Christs ordinance in whole or in part; and so in other their abominations. The Pope himselfe, the great Antichrist, the son of perdition, reteyneth Christian religion in part. The image of God wherein he made man at the first, Gen. 1. 26. remaineth in all men still in part, as the Scriptures testifie, Gen. 9. 6. Iam. 3. 9. Wherefore if the reteyning of things <hi>in part,</hi> holdeth men still in the state of grace and salvation: who then shall be damned? What a wide gate is here opened into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, that if men reteyn Christian religion, <hi>either for faith or order, or both; in whole or in part,</hi> they remain still in the church and covenant of grace: which is quite contrary to the doctrine of Christ, and of his Apostles, Math. 7. 13. 14. 22. 23. 1. Cor. 6. 9. 10. Gal 5. 19. 20. 21.</p>
               <p>6. His sixt reason, from the Iesuites profession made in their Rhemes Testament &amp;c, I have before answered; it being in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond argument made for the church of Rome. And that which he addeth of their <hi>baptising with water in the name of the Father</hi> &amp;c: is of no more weight to justifie their baptisme; then the like elements of bread and wine, and the words of Christs institution <hi>This is my body</hi> &amp;c, are to justifie the Popish Masse to be the true supper of our Lord. Of which Mass, (to omitt that which many others have written of the abomination of it) Mr. Calvin <note n="*" place="margin">In his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon against idolatry, on Psa. 16. 4.</note> sayth thus, <hi>The Mass <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Satan, utterly to abolish the sacrament of the Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. His seventh reason, that Iewes and Pagans are turned to the popish Christian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aith; was also refured in answer to his second reason brought for the church of Rome. The conclusion, that there needeth no repeating of baptisme, as there was none of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: is granted, and by me never denyed.</p>
               <p>8. Likeweise his eight reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>God hath his people in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Babylon, Rev.</hi> 18. 4. <hi>under his covenant of grace;</hi> is before answered. But he should have proved (if he could) that Babylon itself (which is the church of Rome) is under the covenant of grace: that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the holy Ghost shewing in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. ch. that she is under wrath, and destruction. He sayth, <hi>the children of that church should plead with their mother</hi> (<hi>as the Prophets taught and dealt with Jsrael of old, Hos</hi> 2. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. 1. 2. 12. &amp;c) <hi>that she take away her fornications out of her sight</hi> &amp;c. It is true, so they should: but why doth this man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish from the word of God? For the Prophets words are, <hi>Plead with your mother, plead; for she is not my wife, neyther am J her husband; let her therfore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus doe I plead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this mother church of Rome; but my opposite blameth me, and pleadeth for her, she is the wife of Christ, and not divorced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as before we have heard. <hi>Baptisme</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is not of her adulteries, but of Christs ordinances.</hi> True, so is the Lords supper, so is excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, not of her adulteries; but of Christs ordinances; and we reteyn them from Christ. But that whorish church hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and adulterated all these and other ordinances of Christ, &amp; turned them to abominable idolatries and lyes; for which we also plead against her: and her synfull abuse of these divine ordinances, shall nor justify, but the more condemne her.</p>
               <p>9. To his ninth and last reason, <hi>if baptisme be renounced, then also the articles of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That it should be no better then the dayly washing of our face; is wrongfully imputed to us; and Mr. Cl. whom hee citeth in his margine, professeth to hold no such thing. For our dayly washing, is no religious action, nor sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all; but baptisme by hereticks and apostates, is a religious action after their manner, and a false sacrament, <hi>therfore neither true, neither yet none at all;</hi> as our opposite with us once professed. <hi>Apolog. p.</hi> 110. Insted of proving it true baptisme, hee bringeth <hi>reasons</hi> to shew, that <hi>if it were an idol and lying signe, it ought to be renounced, and an other received.</hi> This he knoweth the Anabaptists doe practise: so it is no conviction of, them all. But he bendeth his force now against us, and leaveth them. Let us try what he sayth.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Because</hi> (sayth he) <hi>idols and lying signes and fictions are not of God, but of the Divil, who is a liar, and father thereof,</hi> Ioh. 8. 44. Rom. 3. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I grant that which he sayth: but he concludeth not the question. Idols so farr as they are idols and lies; are wholly of the Divill, and so farr forth to be renounced. But some idols and lies, are made of Gods true ordinances, and of his good creatures; as Paul sayth of the Gentiles, that <hi>they changed the truth of God into a lye; and worshiped and served the creature,</hi> Rom. 1. 25. Here the Gentiles lie, is to be doen away, and their idolatry renounced: but the truth of God is to be reteined, and a holy use of the good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be had, which they abused. So wee have renounced the popish idolatry and lies which they have brought upon Gods sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; but the truth we reteyne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:23010:67"/>2. <hi>An idol,</hi> or <hi>such a baptisme as is no more then a dayly washing of our faces, cannot be the signe and seale of Gods true and everlasting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I grant it: and from his own words conclude against him; Baptisme in the Church of Rome is formerly proved to be an idoll: because they give to the creature and work of mans hands, that honour which is due unto Christ onely. Therefore it cannot bee a signe and seale of Gods everlasting covenant; by his owne grant. As for us, we reteyne no idoll, but Gods truth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as before I shewed.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>The signe in a Sacrament is that which is outward and visible; which in baptisme is washing with water in the name of the Lord. Jf this be a ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and lying signe, in the churches aforesayd, then is it not the Lords: and they there baptised have not then the outward visible signe, which the Lord ordained to be had of his people, and therefore are bound to get it unto them, where it may be had,</hi> Rom. 4. 11. &amp; 6. 3. 4. Act. 10. 47. 48. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The first part of his reason is unperfectly set down: for <hi>washing with water</hi> is a signe of the washing away of sinns, by and in Gods institution onely; by which institution it is to bee mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to none but the faithfull and their seed, Act. 8. 36. 37. &amp; 2. 38. 39. If it be not ministred according to this ordinance of God, it is not the signe of his grace in that abuse, though it be the thing which God in the right use hath appoynted for a signe. 2. Hee would deceive his reader, as if we held washing should be with any other creature then <hi>water,</hi> or in any other name then the <hi>Lords.</hi> These things wee know are in themselves the true ordinances of Christ; but by Antichrist turned to a lye, whiles hee falsly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth them to his adulterous synagogue, which Christ hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to his Church onely; and whiles hee idolatrously giveth that grace to the work of his sacrilegious priests, which is peculiar to Christ and his bloud. It is the true signe of the covenant of Christ which is by Antichrist turned to a lye: and if we should devise to our selves any other signe, we should be lyars like him: who hath devised, creame, spittle, and other like elements, synfully joyned with his baptisme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4. That also is to be doen without delay, seeing the neglect of baptisme is sin, and no unbaptised may eat of the Lords Supper, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true: and so we, if we had not been baptised with water, &amp;c. would doe it without delay. But hee trifleth, insisting
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:23010:67"/>
upon the outward element, which he knoweth we had: and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the main thing, the relation to the covenant of grace, which we had not in that Antichristian synagogue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5. Jf any reteine an idol baptisme, &amp;c. and presume to come to the Lords table, they eat judgement to themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We reteyne no idoll baptisme: but have put away the idoll, and the lye: and reteyne the truth onely, as before is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The same we answer to his sixt reason, which is but a repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and inlargement of his former, as is his manner.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Neither can it be thought that repentance (which still they speak of) should ever make a lye to be a truth, and idol to be Gods ordinance, &amp;c. For though repentance findeth mercy with God for a lye, yet a lye is a lye stil, and an idol-vanity.</hi> Zach. 10. 2. Ier. 10. 8. Ioh. 8. 44. &amp; 14. 6. &amp; 17. 17. with 2. Cor. 6. 14. 15. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true, of such idols and lies as the Scriptures which he citeth speaketh of; but there are other idols and lies, which by men are made of God himselfe, and of his word and ordinances, which by Gods grace upon mens repentance and faith, are resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the first truth. As, the Gentiles <hi>changed the truth of God into a lye,</hi> Rom. 1. 25. and <hi>changed the glory of the incorruptible God, into an image,</hi> Rom. 1. 23. and Israel changed God <hi>their glory, into the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of an Oxe,</hi> Psal. 106. 20. When they repented of their changing the truth into a lye, they reteyned the truth still, and kept <hi>that God</hi> whom before they <hi>ignorantly worshiped,</hi> and of whom they had made an idoll to themselves, Act. 17. 23. So for Gods ordinances; as, if the Israelites had made idols of <hi>Jachin</hi> and <hi>Boaz</hi> (the two sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall pillars in the Temple) 2. Chron. 3. 17. and had burnt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense to them, as they did to the brazen Serpent, 2. King. 18. 4. they should have repented of, and put away their idolatry, but have reteyned those pillars still, for such signes as God had ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them. But such pillars and posts as Israel had invented of their own heads, and set them by the Lords posts, Ezek. 43. 8. no repentance could make them the Lords posts, but they must have been utterly taken away. So in Popish baptisme, water is the Lords ordinance, by them abused and turned to an idoll: salt, oyle, &amp;c. are Antichrists ordinances set up also for idols; these latter we ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly reject, because they were never Gods ordinances in baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; the water we reteyne, having put away onely the abuse and lye of Antichrist annexed thereto. If this bee not so, then the Iewes
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:23010:68"/>
should not onely have repented of and put away their lye, when they used those lying words, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Ier. 7. 4. but they must have destroyed the Temple it selfe also. And whereas the Papists and other hereticks make lyes of the Scriptures, and of Christs holy words <hi>This is my body,</hi> make their idoll of Transubstantiation, and the like; they thould not onely repent of their lies, and put away their idols; but also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Christs words, and put away the holy Scriptures; if this doctrine of our opposites be true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>8. Nor doe they in deed repent, who stil reteyne such baptisme, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves think to be an idol, &amp;c. for true repentance bindeth us to cast away all idols, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is already answered: neither doe we reteyn such a baptisme as wee think <hi>to be an idol;</hi> but that ordinance of God which <hi>was an idol</hi> by Antichrists abuse, and is through the grace of God restored unto his former truth, that onely doe wee reteyne, repenting of our former abuse thereof amongst them. God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe (as I have shewed) was made an idoll by the Gentiles; their repentance bound them to cast away their idolatry, but to reteyn God still.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> A good beginning. The Apostle sayth, there is <hi>one Lord, one faith, one baptisme;</hi> Eph. 4. 5. Himselfe also a little before, <note n="*" place="margin">Chr. plea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:23010:68"/>
an other inward. Whereas, though there bee two actions, one outward, doen by men, the other inward, doen by Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: yet both are but one baptisme, one sacrament; as the outward body, and the inward soule, make not two men, but one man. A sacrament is a sacred order between the outward visible thing, and the spirituall invisible, which have a mutuall proportion and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse between them. The Apostle sayth, <hi>That is not circumcision which is outward in the flesh,</hi> but that which is <hi>of the heart, in the spirit,</hi> Rom. 2. 28. 29. If they have in Rome but the outward wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without the inward: then have they not true baptisme, but a false deceitfull signe. Secondly, it is not true, that I spake but of the inward work onely, for I spake also of the outward; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had in Rome, need not be repeated: as I shewed by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Israelites. Now which of us two <hi>shifteth, contradicteth,</hi> and <hi>deceiveth,</hi> I or he: let indifferent men say.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>They spake</hi> (sayth he) <hi>of abuses in the ministration, and opinions of the Ministers thereof: whereas our question is of the thing it selfe, not of the abuse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We speak of the thing it selfe (Baptisme) abused by the ministers and receivers; neither of which are in Gods covenant; and therefore can have no true signe or seale of his covenant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in that estate. Secondly, if it were not for <hi>abuses</hi> and <hi>opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> of men, God and his truth, and ordinances, could never bee changed into lies and idols, as the Apostle teacheth us they were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 23. 25. The Athenians were idolaters against the true God; whom Paul preached, and whom they ignorantly worshiped, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 23. If one would take them in hand to excuse them, &amp; say, Our question is of the thing it selfe (the true God) and not of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians abuses and opinions, were it not a worthy plea? yet such we have, for Antichristians baptisme.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Their assertion</hi> (sayth he) <hi>implieth that they had not the Lords bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, till they got it themselves by comming to the Lord in true faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which is plain Anabaptistry, and covert Popery and Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme: whereby they debase Gods grace, and exalt mans works. For it must be understood either of the inward or outward baptisme: if of the inward, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that it toucheth not the question, it implieth Popery: if of the outward, it conteyneth Anabaptistry.</hi>

Neither doe my words imply such a meaning; any more then our Saviours, when he sayd, <hi>Come unto me all yee that labour, &amp;c. and J will give you rest: take my yoke upon you, &amp;c. and yee shall finde rest to your soules:</hi> Math. 11. 28. 29. To conclude of that speech, Therefore they could come of themselves; or their comming should be a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious work, or the like: were an openinjury to our Lords words. His two baptismes <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>outward,</hi> is before shewed to bee but'an evasion: wee acknowledge but <hi>one baptisme,</hi> Eph. 4. 5. Neither if it be understood of the outward, doth it (as hee sayth) conteyn <hi>Anabaptistrie;</hi> for the Anabaptists doe not hold that they have the outward baptisme by faith and repentance, but doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the outward vvork, and baptise againe; vvhich I deny. So herein he hath done me double vvrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4. Jf they had died in infancie, they had not then had the Lords bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, nor had been baptised with the Holy Ghost: nor any other infants there baptised.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We and all, are by nature the children of vvrath, Eph. 2. 3. and being born in Antichrists church, we had not the visible covenant of promise, vvhich is given onely to Christs Church. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit God hath his elect in false Churches, as among the Gentiles of old, and in Israel after they vvere divorced from the Lord. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. vvhom he can save vvithout baptisme, as he did vvithout cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision. The same is answered to his fifth obiection, of the<note place="margin">5</note> same persons come to yeares. And is further cleared in the* an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to his second argument for the Church of Rome; vvhere he alleaged the like things. And vvhere he sayth, <hi>Either we have no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward baptisme at all, confirming the covenant of God: or else we had it before we came under the Lords covenant, and in a church divorced from the Lord.</hi> I answer; Wee had the outward vvashing vvith vvater, as the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites had the outward cutting of the flesh, vvhen they were divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the Lord, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 8. vvhich could not then confirme Gods covenant to us or them in such synfull estate. But as after, vvhen
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:23010:69"/>
they repented, and turned to the Lord, they had their outward cutting sanctified unto them, for a signe of his covenant, and were admitted to eat of his Passover, Ezr. 6. 21. (vvhich no uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised might eat of, Exod. 12. 48.) so our vvashing hath been by like grace sanctified unto us, for a signe of his covenant; and vve may lawfully eat of the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>His 6. reason is of like na ure, touching the members of the<note place="margin">6.</note> Antichristian church, <hi>that they have not the Lords baptisme, being not come to the Lord in true faith and repentance, &amp;c.</hi> This also is before spoken of in answering his reasons for that church. The Scripture sheweth them to bee departed from the faith of Christ, 2. Thes. 2. 1. Tim. 4. to bedead in syn, Rev. 20. to bee under the vvrath of God, Rev. 14. 9. 10. 11. Our opposite himself sayth of that church, <hi>She is a notorious harlot and idolatress:</hi> and of the Hierarchie (the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of that church, vvhich have the same baptisme vvith the people, and doe administer baptisme to that people) he sayth, they are the <hi>Man of Syn, the son of perdition, 2. Thess. 2. the Beast. Rev. 13.</hi> concerning vvhom he could not endure that vve should aske his proofe that ever they were maried unto Christ. And are such a people and Hierarchy, remaining in that estate, <hi>come to the Lord in true faith and repentance?</hi> If they have brought themselves by their idolatries, heresies, and innumerable synns, into <hi>a woeful estate:</hi> vvhat are we, that we should justifie those vvhom God condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. Let false prophets preach peace unto them, wee must not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding declare the judgements of the Lord, vvhose <hi>wrath is revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who deteyn the truth in unrighteousness,</hi> Rom. 1. 18.</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Finally</hi> (sayth he) <hi>Wheras they say, the outward washing need not to be repeated, and yet say also, they have renounced the Romish Baptisme as an impure idol in their abuse; they use shifts, and contradict themselves. For if the outward baptisme be an Idol, why doe they reteyn it? Jf not, why have they renounced it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. I have formerly shewed, the <hi>shift</hi> and <hi>contradiction</hi> to be in himself; who pleaded against the Anabaptists, that there is but <hi>one baptisme,</hi> and now against us would have two. 2. I have also shewed, that Gods ordinance turned into an idol or lye; the lye, the idol, is to be renounced, the truth of the ordinance reteyned: so doe we.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> (sayth he) <hi>which they speak of their abuse, is a shift. Difference</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:23010:70"/>
                  <hi>is to be put between a thing abused, and th'abuse therof. The scriptures are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the word of God, and not an impure idol to be renounced, though they be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Papists and themselves &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. when he hath nought ells to answer, he casteth reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and calleth my reason <hi>a shift.</hi> Would he have me so impious, as to call Baptisme, the Lords supper, or other divine ordinances, <hi>idols:</hi> unless for the syn and abuse of men, which turne them to idols, as <hi>the trueth of God,</hi> was turned <hi>into a lye</hi> by the Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 25. And doe not I put that very difference which himself here putteth: how then is it a shift in me, more then in him. The scripture in it self is alwayes pure: yet popish heresies falsly gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the scriptures, are most impure; these we reject, but hold fast the scripture. Water in popish baptisme is Gods good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Antichrist hath turned it and the action with it, into an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable idol, as if it gave grace, and washed away syn by the work doon of a sacrilegious priest. This abomination we reject: the creature of God, is of his grace sanctified unto us, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyn it.</p>
               <p>Now follow his <note n="*" place="margin">Chr. plea pag. 34.</note> other reasons to prove it no idol, but true baptisme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1. Because an Idol, &amp;c. is an invention of man in the worship of God. wheras Baptisme in those churches, is of the holy things of God, a true signe of his covenant &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. The first is granted him: the latter is denyed: and he but beggeth the question. For neyther doth the church continew in Rome which th'Apostles planted: neyther doth the true baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me there continew, any more then the true Supper of our Lord, (turned by them into an abominable Mass,) or any more then the true ministery, which is changed by his own grant into a <hi>man of syn,</hi> a <hi>Beast,</hi> and the great Antichrist. Or, any more then the true Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of excommunication, which they profane against such as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake their idolatrous church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2. Els those churches should not have a mixture of Gods ordinances with their own inventions, &amp;c but should be utterly deprived of all and every one of Gods ordinances. But they have such a mixed estate: &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. He concludeth nothing: but should conclude, therfore it is no idol to them in their abuse, but Christs true baptisme. This I deny. And first I answer, that all the heathens had before Christs coming a mixture of Gods ordinances with their own inventions:
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:23010:70"/>
yet were they not therfore in the covenant of grace, neyther had they the true signes and seals therof. 2. as mens inventions are idols, so Gods ordinances may by men be turned into idols, as are the sacraments in Rome. For is not the wheaten God in their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, an Idol? what mouth wil deny it? Mine opposite pressed with it, passeth it over alwayes, as if he could not see it. That thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, would have convinced this, and many other his reasons of like sort; if he durst have medled with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3. Jf their baptisme were an idol, then it should be syn in them to reteyn that baptisme still: &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. How often shall we have repetitions of the same thing? He hath been answered: the idol ought to be put away, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, ought to be reteyned? If the Iewes had made an Idol of <hi>Iachin, 2 Chron.</hi> 3. 17. they should have repented of their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, but let the pillar stand. And it is the great syn of the papists, that they keep their Masse, and their popish Christening, and doe not put them away as they are idols, and restore them to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient truth, as they were Christs ordinances.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>When Israel fell into defiction, the Prophets that blamed their ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries, did then also reprove them for not observing religiously such of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God as were still remaining among them.</hi> Amos. 8. 5. with 2. 8. 11. 12. &amp; 5. 4. 5. Ier. 17. 21.—27. with 2. 20.—28. &amp; 7. c. Ezek. 20. 7. with v. 12. 13. <hi>So far were they from accounting Gods ordinances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in apostasie, to be idols, and detestable things, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> So we blame the papists, and all hereticks, for not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving religiously Gods ordinances, whether reteyned among them, or omitted by them. Yet were not the prophets so farr from counting Gods ordinances abused by them, <hi>detestable things,</hi> as he would pretend. <hi>Jncense</hi> was Gods ordinance, yet in Esa. 1. 13. he sayth, <hi>Incense is an abomination unto me. Sacrifices</hi> were Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, yet in Esa. 66. 3. he sayth, <hi>Hee that killeth an Oxe, is as if hee slew a man: hee that sacrificeth a Lamb, as if he cut off a doggs neck: hee that offreth an oblation, as if he offred Swines blood: he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an Jdol.</hi> For these and the like reprehensions, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were counted blasphemers, and persecuted and killed by the Iewes: yet were there not halfe so many corruptions in their sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, as are in baptisme and the Lords Supper now among the Antichristians: though mine opposite counteth me a blasphemer for speaking of them but as they are. And what would he say to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:23010:71"/>
the Passover, and all the sacrifices that apostate Israel offred; were they not detestable things through their abuse: When for offring them as they did, they were by Gods law to be cut off as murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and sacrificers to Divels, Lev. 17. 3. 4.—7. Deut. 32. 17. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with 1. King. 12. 28—33. 2. Chron. 11. 15. &amp; 13. 9. &amp; 15. 3. And was that Passover now a true sacrament and signe of Christ unto them, and seale of the forgivenesse of their syns? If not, then neither was their circumcision: for Gods people have not one sacrament true and another false unto them in the same synfull estate.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Baptisme</hi> (sayth he) <hi>in the defection of Christian Churches, is as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was in the Apostasie of Jsrael. But circumcision in that estate was not an idol or lying signe, &amp;c. but the Lords ordinance, a true signe, had before their defection, and still continuedin their apostasie; as hath also come to pass in the Christian Church, concerning baptisme,</hi> Gen. 17. 7.—14. and Lev. 12. 2. 3. with 2. King. 13. 23. 2. Chron. 30. Ier. 9. 26. Ezek. 23. &amp; 32. 24. 26. 29. 32. Also Mat. 28. 18. 19. Rom. 6. 3. 4. with 2. Thes. 2. 4. Rev. 11. 1. 2. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> As baptisme is answerable to circumcision, so is the Lords Supper to the Passover: all of them Gods ordinances in themselves but abused by the idolarrous Israelites, and by the Antichristians to their further judgement. Yet nothing so farr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused in Israel, as in the church of Rome. Did ever the Israelites beleeve the paschal lamb to be the very naturall body of Christ, and worship it for their maker? Or did they ever add so many abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations to circumcision, as Antichristians doe to baptisme? or did they beleeve that the circumcising by the worke doen, took away all their synns. If they had, then I would prove against all men, that they had turned Gods sacraments into abominable idols. If they did not, then he hath made no equall comparison. But take them as they were, I deny their facraments to have been true signes of forgivenesse of sinns unto them in that their estate. And where is his proof for this? Hee citeth many Scriptures, but not one that confirmeth this point in hand. It is true they had the outward cutting of their foreskin: and so had the Canaanites of Sichem, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. 24. but God instituted the signe of circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be the <hi>seale of the righteousness of faith, Rom.</hi> 4. 11. Now one of the Scriptures which he bringeth for proof, sayth, <hi>All the house of Jsrael were uncircumcised in the heart,</hi> Ier. 9. 26. If they had true faith,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:23010:71"/>
their hearts had been therby purified, Act. 15. 9. and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly circumcised. But they were not circumcised in heart by faith in Christ; therefore their circumcision could not seale up to them the righteousnes of faith; and so was to them a lying signe through their abuse of it. Paul sayth, <hi>If thou be a transgressor of the Law, thy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision is made uncircumcision,</hi> Rom. 2. 25. They transgressed, and continued in transgression, though God called them to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by all his prophets, yet <hi>they beleeved not in the Lord their God; but rejected his statutes and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and followed vanity and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came vaine, &amp;c. and left all the commandements of the Lord their God, and made them molten images, &amp;c. that the Lord removed them out of his sight,</hi> 2. King. 17. 13.—18. and he gave them <hi>a bill of divorce, Jer.</hi> 3. 8. and yet they continued circumcision: which could not be to them in their idolatrous and unrepentant estate, a seale of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of saith, or forgivenesse of their synns, unlesse we will contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict all the Scriptures, Deut. 29. 18.—21. Mat. 3. 7.—10. 1. Cor. 6. 9. 10. Gal. 5. 16.—21. Rom. 8. 1—8. Rev. 22. 15.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>The covenant of God</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is an everlasting covenant, which God continueth and respecteth even in the times of apostafie, yea and when he chastiseth the transgression thereof, &amp;c. Otherweise the ground and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of Gods covenant and of the seale thereof, should depend on mans work and merit, and not frecly and wholly on Gods grace and mercie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The first is ambiguous and deceitfull: Gods covenant is everlasting, and continued in times of apostasie; but unto whom? Not to the unrepentant or unbeleeving that are hardened in their sinns, as were the Israelites; but to them that repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and turne to the Lord; <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 15.—40. 41. 42.—45. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19. 20. <hi>Prev.</hi> 1. 23.—33. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 18.—21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18. 10.—13. 21. 22. 23. 24. 26. 27. 28.</p>
               <p>The second is untrue; for though God damneth unrepentant and unbeleeving synners (as in justice he needs must, because they are not in Christ,) yet doth not the covenant or seale depend on <hi>mans work</hi> or <hi>merit.</hi> For it is Gods work &amp; grace through Christs merits onely, that men doe repent, beleeve, and return unto him, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 4. 5.—8. 9. And there is no covenant between God and man, but conditionall: for without faith and holines no man shall see the Lord, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. 21. 22. 23. Though these conditions even in men, are the worke of God in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:23010:72"/>
them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. 12. Whosoever is born of God, overcommeth the world, synneth not; but keepeth himselfe, and the wicked one toucheth him not, 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 4. 18. And they that teach otherweise, destroy the Gospel, and open a gap to all profanenesse and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jf God</hi> (sayth he) <hi>break the covenant on his part, when men break it on theirs, then should there stil be a new entring into the covenant again between God and man: and a new baptisme dayly received againe, as the signe and seale thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> God alwayes breaketh not the covenant on his part, when men break it on theirs: but calleth them often back unto repentance, <hi>Psa.</hi> 89. 31—34. <hi>Exo.</hi> 32. &amp; 33. <hi>chapters.</hi> But to some that are hardned, and wil not repent, he breaketh his covenant visibly, casting them out of his church, cutting them off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. 22. giving them <hi>a bil of divorce, Jer.</hi> 3. 8. removeth <hi>the candlestick, Rev.</hi> 2. 5. Otherweise if a man comming from Iudaisme or paganisme to the Christian faith and Church, doe againe revolt from Christ to Iudaisme or paganisme, and for obstinacie in his sin is cut off by the power of Christ from his Church: he must still be reputed in the covenant of God visibly on Gods part: which is most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, seeing God on his part hath cut them off, and given them <hi>a bill of divorce.</hi> If any such returne, the covenant must be renewed, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 7. 19. 20. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. 18. yet the seale of the covenant once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is not to be repeated; as a Christian revolted to paganisme, and cut off from the Church; is not when hee returneth, baptised againe. Because though he was visibly cut off even of God, for his syn: yet by his returne, it appeareth that hee still belonged to his election of grace which was to man invisible, whiles he continued cut off. Yea though he received the seale after a false manner, when it was not due unto him: yet when hee turneth to the Lord it is not repeated. As the Israelites which were circumcised after they were divorced from God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 8. had no new circumcision in the flesh, when they turned unto God, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 6. 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>6. If such were the baptisme of the Church in Rome, &amp;c. then should it be likewise in the East Churches, and in all Churches of the world, when they fall into sin, breaking the covenant. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I deny the comparison. For Rome is revolted from Christ to Antichrist, and fallen from grace, (by the Apostles rule, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 4.) and is become dead in syn, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. and is not the true
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:23010:72"/>
Church of Christ, but a <hi>Man of syn,</hi> and <hi>whore of Babylon,</hi> 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. which things are before proved. Such is not the state of all Churches that syn and break the convenant: till for their hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and contempt of God, they be also cut off, as Rome is: which when they bee, then have they no true sacraments any longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>7. If there, baptisme were indeed a lying signe and fiction, then would it follow that there should be no salvation for any members of those Churches, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining the baptisme there received. For the signe hath reference to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and thing signified, and so a lying signe must have respect to a lying co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. And by a lying covenant there is no salvation to any, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The covenant which the Church of Rome hath made with Antichrist, is a lying covenant; and hath lying signes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it; and God hath sent them <hi>strong delusion to beleeve a lye, that they all might be damned, who beleeve not the truth, but had pleasure in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnes,</hi> 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 11. 12. Therefore by the covenant and seales of that Antichristian synagogue, wee cannot say, that any one by the promise of God shall be saved. But by the covenant of grace which God communicateth with his elect in that and other false churches, many are saved: but that is not the covenant of the church. Of which poynt, I have spoken before, in answer to his 2. Argument for the church of Rome. His reasons are the same, againe and againe repeated. Here further note, how by his argument, the popish Masse may bee justified, thus. If the Lords Supper or Masse in Rome, be an idol, a lying signe and fiction; then is there no salvation for the members of that Church, reteyning the Masse. For a lying signe must have respect to a lying covenant, and by a lying covenant there is no salvation to any. But the church of Rome (by mine opposites plea) is in the covenant of salvation, which is the true covenant; therefore it also hath the true signe and seale of that covenant in their Masse or Babylonish Supper. For our Lords Supper is the true signe and seale of the forgivenesse of synns, and covenant of grace, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 26. 28. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 19. 20. If hee yeeld not this, then hee must say, that they have two covenants, the one of life and salvation sealed to them by baptisme, the other of death and damnation, sealed unto them by the Masse or Supper. So they shall goe both to heaven and hell, by their double covenant.</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Finally</hi> (sayth he) <hi>the baptisme of those Churches is from heaven,</hi>

                  <hi>and not of men: and is derived unto us from the Apostles of Christ, through the loynes of the church of Rome, &amp;c. Therefore is no idollor lying signe, but the true sacrament and ordinance of the Lord, Math.</hi> 21. 21. &amp; 28. 18. 19. <hi>with Rom.</hi> 6. 3. 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 9. 10. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. <hi>ch.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I deny this his conclusion, it being but a begging of the question which he shoud have proved. It is not their baptisme which is from heaven: they are fallen from heaven, and become a <hi>Beast</hi> (or kingdom Ecclesiasticall) arisen out of the earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11. they are gone out from the Apostolike Church, and become Antichrists, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 18. 19. Mine opposite himself hath granted that the Pope and his Hierarchie are Antichrist, the Man of syn, the Beast; never maried to Christ. Again he sayth (in this his <hi>Chr. plea p.</hi> 3.) <hi>Jn baptisme the action is wholly enjoyned &amp; layd upon the baptiser, and not upon the baptised.</hi> The baptizers in Rome, are the Priests, which be a part of the beast, and Man of syn: on them the whole action lyeth, as he sayth. Now is this baptisme from heaven? Did God ever bid Antichrist baptise? The whole action then of popish baptisme, lyeth upon them that are confessed by him, to be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ: &amp; yet this baptisme he wil have to be from heaven. 2. They were not in the loyns of the primitive Christian Church, either by nature or by grace; otherweise then all nations in Moses time, were in the loynes of the primitive Church in Noes time. 3. We have not our baptisme fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, but from God, who hath delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us from Antichrist, &amp; given us to his son Christ; and hath so sanctified to us that baptising with water in his name, which they idolatrously and synfully abused; as wee need no other outward washing, but to be baptised by his spirit; as his dealing with such as had been circumcised in Israel, (after they were become a false church, and were divorced from him) and returned againe unto him, doth assure us; 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. <hi>ch. Ezr.</hi> 6. 21. His reason may also as probably bee framed thus. The Lords Supper or Masse in the Church of Rome, is from heaven, not of men, <hi>Math.</hi> 26. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. and is derived unto us from the Apostles of Christ, through the loynes of that Church, which have from that time reteyned and continued it to this day. Therefore it is not an idoll or lying signe; howsoever all protestants with one mouth call it justly, an idoll, an horrible idoll, an abomination, and the like. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of the church of Rome, is from heaven, and not of men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. and is derived to us from the Apostles, through the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:23010:73"/>
loynes of that church, which have from that time continued it to this day. Therefore it is not the <hi>Man of Syn,</hi> the <hi>Beast,</hi> the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> as all protestants say, and as Mr. Iohnson himselfe hath pleaded in his last book, but the true ministery and ordinance of the Lord. The like may be sayd for their Excommunications, and all other divine ordinances which that church hath synfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned. Yea the very same plea, might all the heathens have made for their sactifices and divine ordinances, which from Noe and his sonns, through the loynes of their parents were derived unto them; as before I have manifested.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It followeth that they in their Antichristian estate and abuse, have changed Gods ordinance into an idoll and lying signe, as the Gentiles of old, <hi>changed the truth of God into a lye,</hi> Rom. 1. 25.

               <p>
                  <hi>Or will it follow, because of their errours and corruptions, that the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme there had is to be renounced, and an other new one to be received?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Their lyes and lying signes, and changing of the truth into a lye, are all to bee renounced: but the ordinance of God which he hath restored to the former truth unto those that repent and beleeve in him, is not to be renounced, and a new received; and such is the outward washing with water in his name, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. <hi>Ezr.</hi> 6. 21.</p>

But they bow down &amp; worship the bread in the Supper: will he grant that to be an idoll?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jf that were doen unto it</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>as was unto the Sun among the Jewes; why might it not be stil notwithstanding Gods ordinance in it selfe: as the Sun was the true Sun, and Gods creature, even unto them, and in that their estate, whiles they made it an idol to themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> O fraud and guile in pleading for idolaters! Every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God is <note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 1. 31.</note> good, every ordinance of God is holy <hi>in it selfe:</hi> who doubteth of it? If this distinction helpeth the popish sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it helpeth the heathens idols of silver and gold, which are Gods good creatures <hi>in themselves.</hi> But it is a mere fallacie to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as he doth from the <hi>Sun</hi> to Baptisme; from a creature which is an absolute substance, to a sacrament which is a relation of the covenant between God and men. No idolatry, unbeleef, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wickednes can hinder the Sun from being Gods creature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men in that their synfull estate. If it bee likeweise in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then no idolatry, unbeleef, or other wickednes, can hinder baptisme and the Lords supper from being true signes and seales of Gods covenant of grace and forgivenesse of synns, unto Turks or Pagans, in their synfull estate, if they baptise with water in the name of the Lord, and eat the bread and wine in the Supper of our Lord. But he should have knowen that common received rule of all truly religious, that Nothing is in deed a sacrament, without the use ordeyned of God: as we are taught of the Apostle, This is <hi>not to eat the Lords Supper:</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20. The water that flowed out of the rock, was the same creature of God to men that drunk of it, and to the beasts that drunk of it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. 11. but it was a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to men onely, using it for a confirmation of their faith, by a divine institution, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. Further, by his reason, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable that the Pope himselfe (whom he acknowledgeth to be
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:23010:74"/>
Antichrist) and all that partake with him in his Masse, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all their idolatry and heresie thereabout, doe eat the true sacrament, signe and seale of the forgivenesse of their synns. And why then should hee deny the Pope to bee as good a Christian as himselfe: seing all they are blessed whose synns are forgiven them, Rom. 4. 6. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let it be observed, that they baptise onely in the name of the Lord: and with acknowledgement of the Articles of the Christian saith, as in their form of baptisme may be seen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> And let it also bee observed, that they sacrifice their Masse (or celebrate their idolatrous supper) onely in the name of the Lord; and with acknowledgement of the same Articles of Christian faith, even by the Pope himselfe. Why then hath hee pleaded against the Pope and his Hierarchy, that they, they onely are the <hi>Man of syn, the son of perdition, the Beast,</hi> the <hi>Antichrist;</hi> and why wondred he so at me, when I called for proofe that Christ was maried to that Beast; seeing he hath the same baptisme, the same Lords Supper, the same beleef touching the Articles of faith, that the people of his church have. But their counterfeit profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Christ is before discovered. And they that baptize (which are the Hierarchy) he confesseth to be the Man of syn, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, they are none of the church (as we have heard) but ulcers, gangrenes, &amp;c. what now have such to doe with the name of the Lord, or administration of the seales of his covenant. And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with this, that which himself sayth in the 3. page of his book, that <hi>the action</hi> (<hi>of baptisme</hi>) <hi>is wholly enjoyned and layd upon the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiser, and not upon the baptised.</hi> If this be so, where hath God layd the action of baptizing upon Antichrist, the Man of syn: and if God hath not layd it upon him, how can hee truely doe it in Gods name?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How will they prove</hi> (sayth he) <hi>that it is a lying signe unto them in their estate, seeing baptisme</hi> (<hi>as the other sacraments in Israel and under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi>) <hi>hath this in it to be a signe by the ordinance of God, not at the pleasure of man. And God is the God of truth, and appoynteth no lying signes, but true. Neither can mans iniquity make Gods signes to be lying signes. Synful ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and erroneous it is so to think, if not also blasphemous so to speak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> And was it synfull and erroneous (thinketh he) in Paul, when he sayd, <hi>They changed the truth of God into a lye, Rom.</hi> 1. 25. For if mans iniquity cannot change Gods signes into lying signes:
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:23010:75"/>
how should it change the truth of God into a lye? And how could Ieremie have proved unto the Iewes (if mine opposite had then lived to plead for them) that those were <hi>lying words,</hi> when they sayd <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Ier. 7. 4. for had they not in deed the Temple of the Lord, his true ordinance and signe, whereof they spake? The word of God is <hi>truth,</hi> Ioh. 17. 17. How then should mans iniquity, make Gods truth to be a lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themselues, though they pervert the word unto all manner false-doctrine, errour and heresie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Idols are lies, Esa. 44. 20. Ier. 16. 19. 20. How can the Pope make an idoll of the bread in the sacrament, though he fall downe and worship it, and beleeve it is his maker: seeing as it is bread, it is a true thing, and Gods good creature; as it is sacramentall bread, it is a true signe by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, who appoynteth no lying signes. Is it not blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous now, and would he not rend his clothes as did <note n="†" place="margin">Math. 26. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But to conclude, The sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are in deed signes by the ordinance of God, not at mans will: Gods ordinance maketh them signes of grace to the faithful receivers onely, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20. 29. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 25 <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 36. 37. If infidels and Antichrists falsly challenge and usurp Gods signes, and abuse them to open idolatry, and their own perdition; they change the truth of Gods ordinance into a lye unto themselves; and whiles they vainly think to have forgivenesse of synns by them, they add syn unto syn, and receive their own damnation.</p>
               <p>Whereas I had <note n="*" place="margin">Animadv. ag. 69.</note> set downe two reasons to prove the Popish baptisme <hi>false,</hi> and a lying signe unto them: mine opposite passeth them over, as too heavy for him; and cometh to <note n="†" place="margin">Chr. plea ag. 38.</note> set downe differences between Gods ordinances and mens corruptions; Gods signes, and mens errours: Mariage, meates and drinks, and the abuses of these; the scriptures, and the errors gathered from them; the Sun, Moon and Starrs, as they are creatures, and as they are made idols and worshiped of men, &amp;c. Wherein he laboureth to prove the thing which we hold; and doth most injuriously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate against us, as if we thought the contrary. Should we be so wicked as to imagine the ordinances of God, or his creatures to be evill in themselves? Farr be it from us. Nay we say, that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists for abusing the sacraments, and turning them to lyes and idols, shall have the greater judgement: not for abusing bread and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:23010:75"/>
wine and water as they are creatures onely, but for abusing them as they are sacramentall signes ordeyned of Christ, which maketh their profanation more horrible, their damnation more just. But this is a practise of many, that plead for errour; to leave the arguments which doe convince them, and to propone new questions and reasons of their owne: that they may seeme to say something, by multitude of words.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> He might have seen reasons in the books before cited, besides those that I have set down.

Neither is there a like degree of abuse in all; neither doth every abuse make a thing an idoll: but when the honour due to God alone, is given to a creature, then it is made an idoll: and so I have proved is doen in the church of Rome; to which proofs he answereth not. I instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <note n="†" place="margin">Animadv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 73. 74.</note> the Lords Supper in Rome, whereof they have made an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable idoll, worshiping a peece of bread as their maker. Mine opposite will never mention or meddle with this, but shunneth it as convinced in conscience. And from Antichrists church, runneth to the Christian Church in Corinth; and asketh if the Lords ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there, were a table of Divils? I answer, No; not then in Corinth, but now in Rome, they have made it by their idolatrous Masse, a table of Divils: and as Moses sayd of Israel, <hi>they sacrificed to Divils, not to God. Deut.</hi> 32. 17. so say I of these Antichristians, their sacrifice of the altar is a sacrifice to Divils, not to God. This he should have disproved, if he could have doen it; and not to leave the persons and things whereof wee dispute, and run to others. So the Lords baptisme, they have turned into an idol<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ascribing the gift of grace (which onely is Gods) to water, words and works of men: that as the Gentiles turned the truth of God into a lye, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. these <note n="*" place="margin">Rev. 11. 2.</note> Gentiles also have turned the truth of God, and of his sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into lyes. And as the Lords incense and sacrifices were an <hi>abomination</hi> to him, from the hands of wicked sinners. <hi>Esai.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 8. so the Lords sacraments are an abomination to him, from the hands of Antichristians. And as hee doth, so ought all his people to esteeme of them; and not to regard <note n="†" place="margin">Ier. 7. 4. 8. 9. 10.</note>

               <p>1. <hi>Observe</hi> (sayth he) <hi>a needless distinction of idols, nothing helping for the question in hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The distinction is true and needfull to discern the truth of the question, against his clamorous reproches, as if I called Gods ordinance in it self considered, an idoll.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Jf they mean</hi> (sayth he) <hi>that baptisme there had is an idol of both sorts, they doe the more increase their errour.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I doe so meane: yet is there no increase of errour: I heare his bold words, but no proof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3. They speak of crosses, exorcismes, &amp;c. whereas we speak of the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme it selfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> So doe I: but of popish baptisme, mixed with Christs or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Antichrists together. All parts of a thing put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, make the whole: and it is deceitfull dealing to dazel mens eyes with the whores golden cup, and to passe by the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ingredients, the fornications that are in it, when both are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, <hi>Rev. 17. 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4. They speak of the abuse, our question is of the thing it selfe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their sinful abuse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Our question is of popish baptisme, which cannot bee rightly handled without looking to their abuses: for how should we judge of the heathens worship and sacrifices, if wee looke not upon their abuses, as Paul doth in <hi>Rom. 1.</hi> The same I answer to his 5. exception, of their <hi>opinions</hi> and <hi>errours.</hi> Take away the errours of actions, and what fault can we finde with any?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>6. If the Romish baptisme be a lye in the right hand of all that receive it: then of infants; then also in their own right hand that were baptised there. Not to speak of the Martyrs, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is no respect of persons with God. Bee they old or
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:23010:77"/>
yong, better or worse: syn is syn in all. Though Gods grace in Christ, purgeth syn from his elect, which remaineth in the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.</p>
               <p>His 7. 8. and 9. exceptions, are vain; and repetitions of former things, without conviction. If Bellarmine or any speak truth, wee may speak it with them: so Paul speaketh with the heathen Poets, <hi>Tet. 1. 12. 13. Act. 17. 28.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>10. Jf they mean the true sacraments in Christs Church, seale not up to Gods people, forgiveness of sinns, it is an errour: if they meane that they doe not themselves take away sinns, and conferr grace, they use shifts, and keep not to the poynt of the relation here spoken of, and as it is appoynted to bee by the Lord himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The first I grant him; and hee knew well it was not my meaning. The latter I have proved, that they being under Gods wrath, <hi>2. Thess. 2.</hi> have no seale from God of forgivenesse of synns in that estate. And their doctrine of conferring grace by the work doen, is hereticall and idolatrous: which he not being able to gainsay, puts it away (as his manner is) with <hi>a shift.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>11. From Gods sentence of condemnation touching Antichrist and his adhaerents, they reason to Gods baptisme never condemned by the Lord, but still continued in the Church and Temple of God, where Antichrist sitteth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Of his own mouth let him be judged. Wee reason onely of Antichrist and his adherents, the Whore of Babylon, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous church, which hee sayth are condemned of God. How then doth God give them the signe and seale of grace &amp; forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of synns? Gods baptisme wee condemne not, neither our Lords Supper: but Antichrists Christening and Masse, we deny to be Christs baptisme and supper. Hee still beggeth the question which he should prove. And let him take away <hi>Antichrist and his adhaerents;</hi> and the church of Rome, whereof we reason, wil be vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed as smoke, and come to nothing: as take away Christ and his adhaerents, so there will bee no Christian Church, nor sacraments to be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>12. From the brasen serpent, which was but a temporary and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary signe, the use whereof was ceased when it was thus perverted, &amp;c. they reason to baptisme, which is an ordinary signe, whose use still continueth, and may never be taken away or destroyed, to the end of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> We reason not from the one to the other: but by the abuse
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:23010:78"/>
of the one, we shew the abuse of the other. And what is this in him but <hi>a shift,</hi> to plead the temporarinesse of that signe? For if they had burnt incense to it in the wildernesse; or if they had burnt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense to the <note n="†" place="margin">2. Chro. 3. 10. 17. &amp; 4. 3. 4.</note> Cherubims, or brazen Bulls, or pillars which were continued signes, they had made idols of them nevertheless. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therweise the wheaten god in the Popish supper is no idol: seeing the use of the Lords Supper continueth to the worlds end, as well as baptisme. And hitherto of the <hi>shifts</hi> as he calleth them; wherein how he hath shifted in sted of answering by the word of truth, the wise reader may see. Like these are his <note n="*" place="margin">Chr. plea pag. 44.</note> catalogue of <hi>Errours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1. That the baptisme had in the church of Rome is an idol, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is proved by the 2. commandement, <hi>Exod. 20.</hi> whiles they ascribe divine honour to the creature. 2. It is proved also by his owne assertion, that bookes of prayer, read for prayer, are idols; as before I shewed from his words in his last book. 3. He sheweth not one word to prove it an errour in me: but sayth, <hi>Of which more hereafter.</hi> Thus vain tantologies are his arguments to oppose the truth which he calleth Errour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2. That whereas idols are of two sorts, both the kinds are in Popish bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme. Jf it be as the brazen serpent, that from an holy signe was perverted to an idol, it should presently be destroyed, as 2. King. 18. 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I deny his inference. If they had burnt incense to the Temple, should it have been destroyed. The brazen serpent was named but for an instance, to shew that holy signes may be made idols by wicked men. This doctrine hee being not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; leaveth it, and would evade by the destroying of it. As if all idols must bee destroyed. The heathens made idols of the Sun, Moon, Starrs, Beasts, Fishes, Mountaines, Lakes, &amp;c. Must all these therefore be destroyed? If men make an idol of their King, as did the Babylonians, <hi>Dan. 6. 7.</hi> must the King presently be destroyed? whoever heard of such divinity? That which hee addeth of the Popes crossings, exorcismes, &amp;c. is before answered: for he sayth, <hi>Our question is of the baptisme it selfe;</hi> as if those were not a part of Popish baptisme. He would have wicked mens actions separated from all their synns, errours and wickednes in doing them. So in deed I could justifie all idolatry in the world: for take away the errour and syn of an action, and that which remaineth must needs be good.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>They say not they have renounced the abuses and kept the baptisme it</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:23010:78"/>
                  <hi>selfe, &amp;c. but say they have renounced that Romish baptisme, as an impure idol in their abuse. If they have in deed so doen, then here again is notable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Anabaptistry. And now then what outward baptisme have they remaining to themselves?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Neither doth Solomon say, the abuse of the wickeds sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is an abomination, and except the sacrifice as holy: but he sayth expresly, <hi>The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, Prov. 15. 8.</hi> He was answered before to his two baptismes outward and inward, that the Apostle (and elsewhere himselfe) maketh but <hi>one baptisme, Eph. 4. 5.</hi> And the outward part thereof we reteyne as now sanctified to us of God; as the outward cutting of the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Israelites was to them that repented, <hi>2. Chron. 30. Ezr. 6. 21.</hi> which again he putteth off till afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4. Note also that the brazen Serpent was not in deed an idol: but an holy ordinance of God, which in time came to be idolatrously abused, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> He sayth all things, but proves nothing. It was in deed an idol, and an holy ordinance idolatrously abused also. These things stand well together. The Sun was in deed an idoll to them that worshiped it: and yet it was a good creature of God also idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trously abused. The bread in the sacrament is in deed an idoll to Papists that worship it as their maker: yet is it also in it selfe, Gods ordinance idolatrously abused: so is popish baptisme. Hee might even as wel say, that Reubens fact in lying with his fathers concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, was not in deed adultery; but an abuse of Gods ordinance of mariage, or a defiling of his fathers bed, <hi>Gen. 35. 22.</hi> &amp; <hi>49. 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5. Moreover, the brazen Serpent was but a temporary ordinance, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This was the twelft of his <hi>shifts</hi> before: now hee repeateth and multiplieth it among his <hi>Errours.</hi> I refer the reader to my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer answer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>6 That the Romish baptisme is an impure idol in their abuse, standing up in the place of Christ, and his precious blood, which it is not, pretending to give grace, &amp;c. which it doth not. But the baptisme in the church of Rome is Gods ordinance, had and planted there by the Apostles, &amp;c. These are the errours and abuses of men about it, not the nature of the baptisme it selfe. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therweise all that have received it, ought to renounce it utterly, and to get an other outward baptisme, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This also was before objected and answered: and it is a world to see how he wearieth his reader with repeating worthlesse reasons. Sacrificing among the heathens I have before proved was
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:23010:79"/>
Gods ordinance. So was the Lords supper in the church of Rome in the Apostles time: so was excommunication; so was the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Bishops, &amp;c. These have been continued in Rome with their baptisme: may we not say therefore the Masse is an idoll, or that the Bishop the Pope of Rome now is an idol and Antichrist? Of our getting an other baptisme (which is the usuall foot and base of his arguments) we have before spoken that which he could not take away.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Wil these men say, that we can without sin reteine any thing, and not utterly reject it, that standeth up in the place of Christs precious blood? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> We cannot indeed without syn reteyne it, while so it stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: neither doe we so reteyn it; far be it from us. Neither might the Gentiles reteyn the <hi>lye,</hi> which they had made of the <hi>truth of God,</hi> Rom. 1. 25. But when the lye was doen away, and God resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them his former trueth, that they were to reteyn. The ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Israelites, if they had set up their own blood of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in place of Christs blood; might not without syn have retey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it whiles so it stood. Yet repenting of their idolatry, they might keep the outward signe without repeating it: even so we in this case.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Errors and abuses of men may hurt themselves: but cannot change the nature of Gods ordinance in it selfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Not <hi>in it selfe</hi> I grant, considered without their abuse: but togither with their abuse, Gods ordinance of sacrifice, incense, &amp;c. is an <hi>abomination</hi> to him, Prov. 15. 8. Esa. 1. 13. So baptisme and the Supper now in Rom, are abominations to the Lord.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Mans unbeleefe cannot make the faith of God of none effect. God is true, though every man be a lyar, Rom. 3. 3. 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> What may we think would he conclude from this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? To cite a place, and leave it doubtfull what hee inferreth, is to deceive the reader. If he intend (according to the question in hand) that the sacraments are seales of grace and of salvation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, whether they beleeve or doe not beleeve: it is a notable errour overthrowing the Gospel; and establishing the popish he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refie of grace <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> by the work doen. The Scriptures teach, touching Gods vvord and promise, that it profiteth not them that heare it, if it be not mixed vvith faith in them, <hi>Heb. 4. 2.</hi> if men beleeve not, they shall not be established, <hi>Esai. 7. 9.</hi> but shall be damned, Mark. 16. 16. they shall not see life, but the wrath of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:23010:79"/>
God abideth on them, <hi>Ioh. 3. 36.</hi> Neither is the faith of God, by mens unbeleef, made without effect. For his truth and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is confirmed as well in damning unrepentant &amp; unbeleeving synners, as in saving those that repent and beleeve. When the righteous turneth from his righteousnes, and committeth iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; he shall dye in his iniquity; and yet the way of the Lord is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall; as sayth the prophet; <hi>Ezek. 18. 24. 25. 26.</hi> Again, as all men naturally are lyars, and doe faile and break covenant on their part, by syn; which God never doeth: so if they continue in syn, and turne not to the Lord by repentance and faith, they all perish, <hi>Luk. 13. 3. 5. Rom. 8. 6.—10. 1. Cor. 6. 9. 10. Jude v. 5.</hi> But let men repent, and turn from their transgressions, so iniquity shall not be their ruine, <hi>Ezek. 18. 30.</hi> Otherweise it would follow, that after men are entred into covenant with God, &amp; are baptized: though they fall fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ to Antichrist (as the church of Rome hath doen) though they fall to Mahomet (as many East churches have doen;) though they turne to be Iewes or pagans, and so dye, yet they shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; for their unbeleef cannot make the faith of God of none effect. But so to expound this Scripture <hi>Rom. 3.</hi> were to turn judgement into wormwood, unto the destruction of mens soules. And if mine opposite would not gather some such thing from it; what will it help his plea for the baptisme of the church of Rome, which is the <hi>whore of Babylon,</hi> whom God hath devoted unto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, except they repent. <hi>Rev. 17.</hi> &amp; <hi>18.</hi> chap.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>The Jewes in Christs time and before, holding justification by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, &amp; workes of the Law; set these up in the place of Christ &amp; his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood, &amp;c. Should we therfore say, that circumcision was then an impure idoll in their abuse? &amp;c. Or should wee not rather learn to put difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Gods ordinance in it selfe, and between mans abuse thereof, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Whensoever Iew or Gentile, held justification by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, sacrifice, or works of the Law: they made their sacraments, sacrifices, and workes idols, impure idols to themselves in their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse. And it is admirable, that men teaching religion, should bee ignorant, that whatsoever creature or work of man is put in the place of God and Christ; it is therby made an idol: though Gods ordinances, and the workes of his Law in themselves are alwayes good; but turned to idols, are alwayes evill, and an <hi>abomination to the Lord,</hi> as is before proved. What mouth can deny, but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists are idolaters in praying to Saints and Angels? If idolaters,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:23010:80"/>
then they serve idols: if they serve idols in so praying; then the Saincts and Angels are idols to them in their synfull abuse. Yet who knoweth not that the Saincts and Angels in heaven, are bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and holy, and not Idols in themselves. But this is mine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites continual fallacie wherby he would deceive his reader; that because Baptisme and the Lords supper, are Gods holy ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in themselves; therfore the Papists that worship them as Gods, have not made them idols to themselves. And under this shelter of falshood he shrowdeth himself when he hath nought else to answer: repeting it I know not how often.</p>

               <p>Answ. Belike then, he would have us take it for no <hi>lye,</hi> but for a truth, that popish baptisme giveth grace, and washeth away syn by the work doen. Neyther is it a lye, but truth, that bread in their Mass is very Christ really &amp; properly, as he died on the cross. To apply <hi>Esa. 44. 20.</hi> against these things, is to hold an errour. Wel, let my errour continue with me: for I trust I shall alwayes hold that they are <hi>lyes</hi> in the right hand of all that so receive them. And as the prophet speaketh of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that by nature were no Gods: so doe I. For neyther is water in Baptisme, not wine in the Masse, Christs blood naturally: neyther can they doe that which onely Christs blood effecteth. And how ever there is difference between the idols of false Gods, and the idols of the true God; yet the scripture calleth them all <hi>Divils, Deut. 32. 17.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron. 11. 15.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 20.</hi> so I call them all <hi>lyes.</hi> And where he sayth, <hi>if it were in the nature of it no baptisme;</hi> he might have knowen, that Gods true ordinance of baptisme, turned into a lye, maketh it a <hi>lying baptisme,</hi> and yet some baptisme it is, though not the true. Wherof the lye being put away, and the truth restored of God unto us; there need no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther renunciation, as before I have proved. His other repetitions and questions of the same thing; need no further answer.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>How wil he shew, that baptisme is so received as standing in the place of Christ &amp;c. seing they are infants usually that receive it there &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. Even as he wil shew against the Anabaptists, that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is truly and rightly received in Christian churches: where they are infants usually that receive it. For as the covenant of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:23010:80"/>
Christ is to parents and their seed: so the covenant of Antichrist is to parents and their seed; even the covenant of destruction; that their babes be dashed against the Rock, <hi>Psal. 137. 9. Esa. 13. 16.</hi> The infants of Iewes, are Iewes; the infants of Turks are Turks; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of Christians are Christians: so the infants of Antichristians are Antichristians.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Considering also their profession of Christ, and baptising with water in the name of the Father Son and holy Ghost; and that this alone is in deed the baptisme of that church; the other things being but erroneous opinions, and synfull additions &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. We have before considered that the profession of that church, is all one with the profession of the Pope, who eyther is not Antichrist, or else he denyeth both the Father and the Son, (as the Apostle sayth, <hi>1 Joh. 3. 22.</hi>) how ever in word he confesseth both. 2. As they baptise with water in the name of the Father &amp;c: so they consecrate their Supper or Mass with bread and wine, and the words of Christs institution, <hi>Mat. 26.</hi> why doth he not also af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that their Mass is no idol, no lye, in the hands and mouthes of them that receive it as their maker, and eat their God, more profanely then the heathens. 3. It is untrue that <hi>that alone</hi> (which he mentioneth) <hi>is in deed the baptisme of that church:</hi> in deed it ought to be, but so it is not. He might as well say, their praiers to God, are the onely prayers of that church; for by divine institution so it should be; but it is knowen they pray also to innumerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. 4. I grant the other things, are but erroneous opinions, and synfull additions: and he also must grant, that all the idolatrie of the heathens, condemned in <hi>Rom. 1.</hi> were but erroneous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and synfull additions; contrary to the covenant which God had made with them in Noes dayes, <hi>Gen. 9. 9. 10. 11. &amp;c.</hi> Were it not for <hi>erroneous opinions,</hi> and <hi>synfull additions;</hi> all men now should be in that perfect estate wherin at first we were created. <hi>Eccles. 7. 29.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>8. That the Romish baptisme is such, as the saying of the Apostle is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in it, an idol is nothing in the world, 1 Cor. 8. 4. &amp;c. Jf so, then the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of that church, hath no relation to God, nor any divine institution, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation, or signification in it, &amp;c. Then it ought of necessitie to be rejected &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. If th'Apostles doctrine be true of idols, that they <hi>are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, 1 Cor. 8. 4.</hi> he ought not to kick against it, or me for alleging it. To his inference I answer, it hath no true relation unto Gods
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:23010:81"/>
covenant (which is not with that Antichristian church,) but a false pretended relation it hath: as their other sacrament of the Mass or supper; where also there is a lying relation to Christs sacrifice, which they blasphemously renew, crucifying dayly the Lord of glorie. To his conclusion, he hath oft been answered: we reject the idol wholly; and reteyn onely the truth, so farr as God by his word hath sanctified it unto us: without eyther <hi>grosse Anabaptistry,</hi> or <hi>notorious blasphemie,</hi> which with open mouth he chargeth us, &amp; would fray the simple with.</p>
               <p>9. <hi>That water</hi> (<hi>the material thing</hi>) <hi>in popish baptisme, is as the gold and silver (that is the matter) of the idols spoken of, Psal.</hi> 115. 4. <hi>wher as the use of water in baptisme is appointed by the Lord and stil to be reteyned, Ioh.</hi> 1. 33. <hi>&amp;c. but the use of gold for idols, is forbidden, and utterly to be abandoned, Exod.</hi> 20. 23. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 25. 26. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. He corrupteth my words. I <note n="†" place="margin">Animadv. pag. 72.</note> sayd, <hi>An idol for the matter and workmanship is somthing</hi> (<hi>Psal.</hi> 115. 4.) <hi>but for the relation unto God, it is nothing. So Popish baptisme as touching the material thing is somwhat, the salt, water, oile, are Gods creatures: the outward action is the work of the hands of an idolatrous preist; and this work remayneth, as did the work of the idolaters circumcising in Jsrael. &amp;c.</hi> This he maketh an errour in me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which all that have knowledge, wil easily see to be trueth. But <hi>the use of water in baptisme,</hi> (sayth he) <hi>is appointed by the Lord.</hi> True, unto the Christian church it is so: but the use of water in popish idol baptisme, or of bread and wine in the Popish mass, was never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Lord: this was the point he should have proved. As God sayd to the Iewes, <hi>bring no more vaine oblations, incense is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination unto me, Esa.</hi> 1. 13. so sayth he to the Antichristians, make no more vaine baptisings, the Masse is an abomination to me. Mine opposite sayth, <hi>the use of gold and silver for idols is forbidden:</hi> very wel; and is not the use of water, bread and wine for idols forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den also? The use of gold to make the images of Cherubims was commanded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 18. but if the Gentiles had made themselves golden Cherubims, they had been idols and syn to them, for God commanded them not. So water, bread and wine, are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Christian church, in her sacraments: but to the Antichris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church God commandeth not these, til they repent &amp; turne to Christ; then and not before may they use them for holy signes. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 50. 16. 17. <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9. 13. 17. 18. In this, his tenth er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or exception is also answered; which is about the very same
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:23010:81"/>
thing: but that he delyteth in multiplication.</p>
               <p>11 <hi>Touching the relation, (which is the mayn thing in a sacrament) that it should seale up unto them the forgivenes of synns, and (as they blasphemously say) quite take away synns, and conferr grace; so it is a vaine idol, and nothing. But the Sacraments in their relation are not onely seals but signes also: Gen.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. <hi>&amp;c. Now (by their assertion) the baptisme aforesayd shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing at all to the mind, and so is a vaine idol and nothing: and that which it sheweth to the eye, is but as the gold and silver of the heathens idols: which if it were true, then in deed there should be nothing of Gods ordinance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nothing of a true sacrament, &amp;c. And can they then blame the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. That there is no true relation in the popish baptisme, is sufficiently proved; the persons being Antichristians, out of the covenant, and without promise in that estate. That they have the true material things, of washing with water in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp;c, I have alwayes granted; though these materials are abused by them to idolatrie, as the Iewes abused their sheep and bullocks to abominable sacrifices. That of the gentiles silver and gold, is true also touching the matter, which is Gods good creature: fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comparison I made not, though he corrupted my words.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Whether think they that the baptisme received in the truest Churches, doe seal up to hypocrites the forgivenes of their synns? If they think not, whether they wil say, that the baptisme of those churches hath not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which is the mayn thing in a Sacrament. Jt is generally held that</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Act. 8. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus who was baptised by Philip, was an hypocrite, and that his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme did not seal up unto him the forgivenes of his synns: wil they therfore say, that the baptisme ministred by the Euangelists, had not the relation &amp;c? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that thus the relation of the sacramentes should depend wholly upon man, and not upon the Lord or his ordinance at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. To passe over his forme of writing, how he asketh ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when he should prove or convince: I answer, his question is from the matter in hand, and so is deceitfull. We speak of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward visible church of Christ and ordinances belonging therto; also of the visible Antichristian church and ordinances there abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. He leaveth this, and runneth to <hi>hypocrites,</hi> which men can not discerne; and whom therfore we must leave unto God, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther secrets, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. To reason from the one of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se to the other, would bring all confusion; for hypocrites are lawfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Church; as was Iudas, Simon Magus and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:23010:82"/>
if upon this ground, open Antichristians, idolaters, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, may be admitted also: then the church and the world, shal be one confused Babel. To his question I answer; baptisme in true Churches administred as th' Apostles and Euangelists did: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ealeth up to all, the forgivenes of their synns; unto the judgment of man; and they should greatly syn, and profane Gods ordinance, to baptise any other. Simon Magus when he was baptised, it is testified that <hi>he beleeved,</hi> Act. 8. 13. so by the ordinance of Christ, he was to be baptised, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. neyther knew they him to be an hypocrite when he was baptised, til afterward. Thus are we bound by the rule of love, to beleeve that all rightly baptised in the Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church, have the seale of forgivenes of synns, and are <hi>buryed with Christ by baptisme,</hi> and that <hi>by one spirit, we are all baptised into one body, Rom.</hi> 6. 3. 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. And so mine opposite beleeving the church of Rome to be Christs true church, and to have his true baptisme, was bound also to beleeve them all to be of one body and one spirit with himself, til they manifest to him the contrary: which seing they have not doen by all their idolatries, heresies &amp; impieties; it is not to be thought that ever people which wil call themselves Christians, could doe it. As for us, we know the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Christ is not with Antichrist, or his whoreish church; though therin God hath many elect: but we know that his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is with the true Christian church, and all the members of it, although therin be many hypocrites and reprobates; both which are manifested in time by their fruits. We walk by the rules revei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to us of God: secret things are not for us to judge of, until they be manifested.</p>
               <p>Where he concludeth, <hi>that thus the relation of the sacraments</hi> should depend <hi>wholly upon man,</hi> and not upon the Lord <hi>at all:</hi> it is a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniation without all colour of proof. The relation is by mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al consent, the Lord offring his son Christ for salvation to all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant beleeving synners: we by grace having obteyned faith, doe therby apprehend Christ for our saviour, as in the word, so in the sacraments.</p>
               <p>His next demaund about our selves and our baptisme had in Rome; is a thing againe and agayn answered, without running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Anabaptistrie, whither he would so sayn drive us.</p>
               <p>12. <hi>These men, erre not a litle, when they say that</hi> (<hi>popish</hi>) <hi>baptisme hath not the relation of a sacrament to them, but is a vaine idol and nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:23010:82"/>
                  <hi>they say of it, that it quite taketh away synns. Shall mens erroneous say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and opinions make a nullity of Gods ordinances, signes and seales? Can not God be true, though they be lyars? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. Here is an other repetition of that which he forealleged in his 6. reason or errour; which I there refuted. Mens erroneous sayings, opinions, and doings, doe disanull to themselves all Gods promises, signes and seals: which are onely conditionall, if men repent, beleeve and obey; which grace God giveth to all that are Christs. And if men beleeve not nor obey, and so be damned: their damnation impeacheth not Gods truth at all, but confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it; for he hath sayd of such, that they shalbe damned. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 36.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Besides the relation in a sacrament, there is also to be regarded the commandment of God, who hath appointed it to be observed in the church. As Christ who was without syn &amp;c, yet in obedience to the Law, was cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised and baptised. &amp;c. Therfore it should be syn in the church of Rome, if they should reject baptisme and not keep it. Which doth plainly evince, that it is not a vaine idol and nothing, (for then it were not syn but their dutie to cast it away; and not to keep it at all) but that it is the Lords ordinance &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. The first is true, for without the word and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, it could be no seale of his covenant, or have any relation at all therto. The second is a deceytful reason, concluding from the holy commandment of God, to the unholy keeping of it in Rome. It should be syn in them to reject baptisme &amp; the Lords supper professedly: it is syn in them, to keep them as they doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely. It were better for a man never to be baptised or eat the Lords supper all his life, then to communicate with the church of Rome in eyther of these, as they profane them: for we may not doe evil that good may come therof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8. So his <hi>plaine eviction</hi> that it is not a vaine idol in their abuse of it, is but a plaine fallacie: let him apply it to the other Sacrament, and it wil appear. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ hath transformed the Lords supper, into an abominable massing sacrifice, and therin worshipeth a wafer cake for his maker and redemer: this he durst not deny to be a notorious idol. But his reason (if it be good) wil prove it no idol: thus. It should be syn in the church of Rome if they should reject the Lords supper and not keep it. Which doth plainly evince that the Lords sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in Rome (though changed by them into a wicked Mass) is not an idol, for then it were not syn, but their duty to reject it. The
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:23010:83"/>
refutation herof is this; Rome and all nations syn, that doe not beleeve aright in Christ, and keep all his ordinances. The more that they openly renounce Christ or any of his ordinances, the more they shal adde unto their syn. Yet in that they keep them not aright<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but have changed the truth of God <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>His 13. and last errour, is but a repetition of former matters, about the brazen serpent, Gods ordinances and creatures consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in themselves &amp;c, to which I have before answered; shewing that it helpeth the Papists no more to clear them of idolatry herein, then the heathens of old, who made idols of creatures and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which in their own nature and first institution, were good and holy. And hitherto of his <hi>errours</hi> wrongfully imputed unto us.</p>
               <p>To these, by his figure of repetition and multiplication, he hath added from the former grounds, <hi>Contradictions, Abuse of scriptures, Uaine distinctions and Anabaptistical assertions:</hi> all which being but the same things turned and repeated, and by me before cleared; I count it needless labour to make the same answers againe, to his empty calumniations.</p>

               <p>Answ. I have shewed how Israel might be called Gods people still: and why I judge them not to be Gods true Church. For Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, they changed not the constitution wherin they were set of God, made no new face of a Church, no new Temples, preists &amp;c as did Israel.

this plaine scripture? He first speaketh of <hi>forsaking God,</hi> what it meaneth, and how it is spoken of the Iewes in the Prophets: namely of forsaking his <hi>Law, Temple, Worship,</hi> and <hi>service: and not simply of so dealing with the Lord himself, as the bare words and letter it self. might seem to imply.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For even in the defection of Israel, when Ieroboam set up the calves, yet stil they intended to worship the Lord that brought them out of the land of Egypt &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 28.</p>
               <p>Answ. First observe, how here he would not have <hi>the bare words and letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> of the scripture to be insisted upon: yet is it his continuall practise, and onely colourable reasons. For the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. and the <hi>people of God,</hi> are his mayn grounds for the church of Rome, and of apostate Israel. 2. He omitteth the words which I cited, that Israel was <hi>without the true God</hi> &amp;c: and speaketh of an other phrase, of their <hi>forsaking the Lord;</hi> to ease his burden, which he found too heavy. 3. It is granted him, that by forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Lord, is meant the forsaking of his <hi>Law, Temple, Worship</hi> and <hi>service:</hi> and not that they did professedly renounce God, but stil pretended and intended to serve the true God: what would he inferr hereupon? This maketh the more against his plea for them. The scripture sayth, they were <hi>without the true God, without teaching Priest, without Law:</hi> this was true, eyther in their own account, or in Gods; not in their own account, for they thought they stil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned the true God, (even as the heathens of old, hereticks, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristians and Iewes at this day, perswade themselves that they serve the true God;) therfore they were such in Gods account. Now Gods judgment is alwayes according to trueth, when mans judgment erreth, and deceiveth himself. Thus then, though Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el thought themselves the true church, and to have the true God (as mine opposite also thinketh and pleadeth for them;) yet in the Lords account, which is trueth, they were <hi>without the true God,</hi> and <hi>without Law.</hi> So mine opposite hath the Israelites own erroneous judgment to help him; I have the Lords judgment &amp; his Prophets, against both him and them.</p>
               <p>He then referreth us to his former book, where he shewed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse respects, how on their part they brake the covenant, but the Lord brake it not on his part, but called them to repentance &amp;c.

Wherby it is evidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that their divorce was from the Lord, and from being his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or partakers of his mercie in Christ.</p>
               <p>Now wheras he gathereth from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 22. that a divorced woman is called <hi>Gerusha,</hi> that is <hi>Cast out,</hi> or <hi>thrust forth,</hi> which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth <hi>from her husbands house:</hi> he might have seen better in the Law of Moses, (to which the Prophet there hath reference) where the like commandement is given, in <hi>Levit.</hi> 21. 14. which a litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in <hi>vers.</hi> 7. is explained by God himself, <hi>Gerusha meishshah,</hi> that is, <hi>cast out</hi> or <hi>put away from her husband;</hi> according to which Law, and phrase, Israel was divorced and cast out, not onely from the Lords house and land, but from the Lord himself. Moreover he might have seen, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 1. <hi>the bill of divorce</hi> in the womans hand, and her <hi>sending out</hi> of her husbands <hi>house,</hi> to be distinct things, one fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing upon an other. Againe, a woman may of her self goe out of her husbands house, &amp; play the whore in an other mans house, yet is she not therby divorced: as for example Michal Davids wife, was by her father Saul, adulterously given to Phalti, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 44. so she was out of Davids house, and had an other <hi>husband</hi> in whose house she remayned: yet David that had not given her a divorce, required her as his <hi>wife,</hi> and she was taken by Abner from her se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond husband, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 14. 15. 16. Wherfore the bill of <hi>divorce</hi> or of <hi>cutting off</hi> is not from the house onely, but disanulleth quite the covenant of mariage; so as they cannot without a new mariage be reunited. And the Lord, (as if he purposely would prevent all
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:23010:87"/>
such vaine pleas for Israel) useth in <hi>Ier. 3. 8.</hi> both the word <hi>put how away,</hi> and the word <hi>divorce,</hi> and this also in the forme plural, thus, <hi>and I gave unto her, the bill of her divorces</hi> (or, <hi>of her cuttings-off:</hi>) as if he would teach us, that whatsoever divorce or cutting off belonged to such an adulterous wife, he had given unto her; and so not from the land but from the Lord also she was divorced. As yet further appeareth by <hi>Hos. 2. 2. plead with your Mother, plead; for she is not my wife, neyther am I her husband;</hi> but if he had onely put her out of the land, he was her husband stil, contrary to that which the Prophet teacheth. And contrary to the Apostle, who writing to the disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of Israel, <hi>which had not obteyned mercie, but now have obteyned mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, 1 Pet. 2. 10.</hi> hath reference to that Prophet, who promised, <hi>I wil have mercie on her that had not obteyned mercie; and I wil say to them which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, thou art my God: Hos. 2. 23.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His applying this divorce to excommunication, is as strange. Excommunicates he wil have to be as put out of the house and church, but not out of the covenant. Wheras excommunicates are (by our Saviours doctrine) <hi>as heathens and publicans, Mat. 18. 17.</hi> and heathens are not in the covenant. Againe by Pauls doctrine, excommunication is the <hi>delivering to Satan, 1 Cor. 5. 5. 1 Tim. 1. 20.</hi> what that meaneth, we may learne by the contrary, in <hi>Act. 26. 17. 18. I send thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darknes to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgivenes of synns &amp;c.</hi> Wher the power of the Gospel is shewed, in turning men <hi>from Satan to God,</hi> wherupon they repenting and beleeving, receive forgivenes of synns: so on the contrary, when men syn, and joyn obstinacie with it, and wil not repent; they are by the power of Christ delivered from God unto Satan againe, that is, are of the world where Satan is prince; and in that estate, deprived of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the forgivenes of their synns, til they turne againe unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>Where he sayth, upon their repentance they may and ought to be received, it is true, so ought the Turks and heathens: for God as he never made absolute covenant but conditional; so he never gave absolute bill of divorce, but conditionall; for who so repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and beleeveth in Christ shalbe saved. And wheras he sayth, <hi>if they had been put out of the covenant of the Lord, they should be baptised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:</hi> it is marvel how he could not see himself herein, to be a very
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:23010:87"/>
Anabaptist, or that which is worse. For if a man be baptised in the true church, as was Simon Magus, and fall from the faith of Christ, to become a Iew, or a Turk, or a paynim; and for his obstinacle &amp; blasphemie be justly excommunicated: this man he thinketh, doth continue stil in the covenant of grace; for he is but cast out of the church or house, not out of the covenant. Who ever heard such doctrine, that the covenant of grace should be continued to most wicked synners, excommunicated for turning to Iudaisme or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganisme? Much lesser syn it were to err with the Anabaptists and baptise againe, then to hold such an heresie. If he hold it not, but would grant that such are out of the covenant: then he sayth, they should be baptised againe, when they returne; and so he that hath so busily set a snare to catch us in Anabaptistrie, is fallen himself into it, or into a worse.</p>
               <p>Now to deliver our soules from both these extremities, we are to observe the difference between the reveiled covenant made with every particular visible church, and the unreveiled estate which is in Gods secret counsel touching all the members of the catholik church the company of those that are predestinated unto life: for many are out of the covenant reveiled, which yet are Gods elect. As the Ephesians whiles they were heathens, dead in synns, were to all mens judgment, <hi>without Christ, without God in the world, and strangers from the covenants of promise, Eph. 2. 1. 12.</hi> who after they were called to repentance and faith, were no more strangers and forrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but fellow-citizens with the Saincts, and of the houshold of God, <hi>Ephes. 2. 13.—19.</hi> in which estate they were in Gods counsel before, being chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world, <hi>Ephes. 1. 4.</hi> On the contrary many reprobates enter into the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the church visible, and as Simon Magus, doe beleeve and are baptised, <hi>Act. 8. 13.</hi> they beleeve for a while, and in time of tentation, fall away, <hi>Luke 8. 13.</hi> Hereupon it cometh to pass, that the church not knowing certainly who are elect, and who not, but judging every tree by the fruits that appeare; receiveth into the covenant and baptiseth all that profess to repent and beleeve in Christ unfeynedly: yet afterward seing them to break the covenat and forsake Christ and wil not be reclaymed, casteth them out, and delivereth them to Satan: in which estate, they cannot be sayd to continue in the covenant, or in the state of salvatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; though the election of some of them standeth sure with God. Who when
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:23010:88"/>
he of his grace giveth them repentance, they are restored againe to the church; and then it appeareth that they fell for a time, but are raysed againe of God. And because when they were first baptised, they were not baptised into that particular church onely, but are counted baptised into the catholike church, and into Christ, his death and burial, <hi>Rom. 6. 3. 4.</hi> therfore though they renew the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, yet their baptisme is not renewed; for then it is manifested to the judgment of man, that the seed of God (though for the time it was not seen) remayned in them, and therfore their syn was not unto death, <hi>1 Joh. 3. 9.</hi> And this the Apostle teacheth us from God, saying. <hi>This is my covenant unto them, when J shall take away their synns. As concerning the Gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers. For the gifts and calling of God, are without repentance, Rom. 11. 27. 28. 29.</hi> Where we see, that while mens synns are not (by promise of God) taken away, they are not in his covenant, (as is confirmed also by <hi>Heb. 8. 10. 12.</hi>) And in that Gods gifts and calling (concerning his elect) are without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; they are to be restored into the covenant, when they turne unto the Lord, without any repeating of their outward baptisme.</p>
               <p>Where he addeth this reason, <hi>For baptisme is the signe of our entrance into (the covenant) and the Lords seale of his so receiving and admitting of us: as circumcision was unto the Iewes;</hi> Though it may in some sense be admitted which he sayth: yet not as he intendeth and urgeth it. For first, Abraham was in the covenant of grace, and justified by faith in Christ, before he received circumcision, <hi>Gen. 15. 6. Rom. 4. 3.</hi> And after that, he received the signe of circumcision, a seale of the righteousnes of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised, <hi>Genes. 17. Rom. 4. 10. 11.</hi> Secondly the children of Abraham were borne in the covenant, and holy, <hi>1 Cor. 7. 14. Ezr. 9. 2.</hi> and borne unto the Lord, <hi>Ezek. 16. 20.</hi> but were not circumcised til the <hi>eight day,</hi> Levit. 12. and such infants as dyed before the eight day, died not out of the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: not to speak of the women in Israel, which were in the covenant without circumcision in the flesh. Thirdly, Moses sayd to men women and children, <hi>ye stand this day all of you before the Lord your God, &amp;c. that thou shouldst enter (or pass) into covenant with the Lord thy God;</hi> Dent. 29. 10. 11. 12. 13. Yet all which had been borne within 40. yeres before, were uncircumcised, and so continued till Moses was dead, <hi>Ios. 5. 2.—7.</hi> By all which it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that men may otherweise enter into the Lords covenant, then
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:23010:88"/>
by Circumcision, or by baptisme now come in sted therof. How much more then, if they have been baptised before, and fallen from the covenant; may they enter into it againe, without a new baptising with water? His other tautologies, I omitt: being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore answered.</p>
               <p>But he thinks to have help from <hi>Jer. 3. 12. 13. 14.</hi> where God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Israel to returne unto him, and he will not cause his anger to fall upon them; and sayth, <hi>Turne o backsliding children, for I am maried unto you; and I will take you one of a citie, and two of a familie and will bring you to Sion.</hi> Where amongst many observations, these are the chief, <hi>1. That God dealt otherweise herein then a man doth with his wife whom he putteth away, and she become another mans; as he shewed in Jer. 3. 1. 2 That these words The Lord thy God, are words of the covenant, Genes. 17. 7. 3ly</hi>. <hi>That he sayth, J am maried unto you; which the best</hi>

That he would take them one of a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and two of a familie, teaching that they should not stay one for an other; &amp; though the body of the people should remaine obstinate, yet if a few returned he would receive them: which sheweth the stability and eternitie of his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as Gen. 17. 7. which he performeth, if but a fewe be made partakers of that grace, as Rom. 11. 1.—5.</hi>

               <p>The scope of this scripture <hi>Jer. 3. 6. &amp;c.</hi> is to shew 1. the transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Israel and Iudah; under the covenant of the Law: 2. the punishments inflicted for the same; 3. and a promise of another covenant of grace which God would make with them in Christ. Israel played the harlot, Ier. 3. v. 6. God called her to repent, but she repented not, v. 7. then God put her away, and gave her a bill of divorces, v. 8. yet Iudah her sister, feared not but played the harlot also, and dissembled, so that Israel justified her self more then Iudah, v. 8. 9. 10. 11. Then God seing them bothe to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant breakers, promiseth of his grace, a new covenant to be made with them in Christ; which he proclaimeth first to Israel, if they repent, acknowledge their synns, and turne unto him, v. 12. 13. and so speaketh of his mariage with them, to weet with the remnant of them, <hi>one of a citie and two of a family,</hi> whom he would bring to <hi>Sion,</hi> v. 14. unto whom he would give faithfull pastours.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:23010:89"/>
v. 15. not as under the Law, and rudiments therof, for the most excellent signes therof, even <hi>the Ark of the covenant of the Lord,</hi> should not be remembred or visited any more, v. 16. But <hi>Ierusalem, the Lords throne</hi> (the Christian <note n="†" place="margin">Hebr. 12. 2. Rev. 4 2. &amp;c.</note> Church) should be for the Gentiles of all nations, v. 17. and for the Iewes, and for the Israelites walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing togither, v. 18. Then sheweth he the signes and fruites of his grace in them, manifested by their calling upon God, as their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Christ, v. 19. their weeping and supplication for their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer synns, v. 20. 21. the Lords promise of mercie to them that returne, and their acceptation of his mercie offred, v. 22. shewed by their humble confession of their synns, and just punishments, v. 23. 24. 25.</p>
               <p>The same argument is in <hi>Jer. 31.</hi> both touching Israel &amp; Iudah, where after many promises, he speaketh of a <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 31. 32.</note> new Covenant with Israel and Iudah, not like the covenant made with their fathers, when he brought them out of Egypt, which they brake, though the Lord <hi>was an husband unto them:</hi> but a covenant, that he would <note n="*" place="margin">v. 33. 34.</note> write his Law in their harts, and forgive their iniquitie; which Paul expoundeth to be the new Covenant or Testament now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Christ, <hi>Heb. 8. 8. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to apply these promises which concerned future times &amp; graces in Christ, to that present time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were in their synns, unrepentant, unbeleeving, unforgiven; under the bill of divorce, and put away from the Lord: is quite to mysse of the mark which the prophet aymeth at. For though he speaketh to Israel as a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or corporation which continueth through many ages: yet not those persons then living, but their posteritie are meant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they perished in their synns (save some few that turned to the Lord) but their after generations found mercie. Neyther can we deny (if we rightly observe th'Apostles doctrine in <hi>Rom. 11.</hi>) but those and the like promises made by the prophets, doe belong to the Iewes even at this day (though for the present they are without the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in their owne persons:) for when the <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 11. v. 25. 26. 27. 28</note> fulnesse of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles is come in, <hi>all Israel shalbe saved</hi> (sayth he) <hi>as it is written<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There shall come out of Sion, the Deliverer, and shall turne away ungodlynes from Iakob.

                  <hi>best writers expound</hi> of the <hi>covenant of grace:</hi> if he referr it to the future time of Christ; is true; but then it will nothing help those unrepentant synners divorced from the Lord: for by the bill of divorce, the mariage is dissolved, as before is proved. If he referr it to former times, it agreeth not with the scope of the prophesie, as I shewed: but if that be granted him, then his <hi>best writers</hi> wil hardly prove it to meane the covenant of grace; for better then they, doe shew it to be the covenant of the Law, even Ieremie himself and Paul his expositor. For Ieremie in chap. 31. v. 32. useth the same word <hi>Baalti, J was maried</hi> to them: when he speaketh of the old covenant made when they came out of Egypt, which was the covenant of workes, not of grace; though they were then also in the covenant of grace, as they were in the faith of Christ. And Paul expoundeth that word <hi>Baalti,</hi> (according to the Greek version) <hi>J regarded them not, Heb. 8. 9.</hi> which is quite contrary to mine opposites purpose. But it is usual in the Prophets, to speak of things to come, as already doen; as Esaias prophesying of Christ sayth, <hi>Unto us a child is borne, Esai. 9. 6.</hi> who was not borne til many yeres after.

               <p>That which he sayth from <hi>Jer. 3. 1.</hi> that God <hi>dealt otherweise herein, then a man doth with his wife whom he putteth away &amp;c:</hi> helpeth him not.

                  </hi> which fault cannot be imputed to the Lord.

               <p>WHeras the Lord testifieth of Israel, that she was not his <hi>wife,</hi> nor he <hi>her husband:</hi> and willeth her therfore to put away her whordomes, left he stript her naked &amp;c. <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 2. 3.

And yet that putting out of the land, he maketh to be the stripping of her naked; which was an effect and reward of her former estate. And mixing the several prophesies togither, (wheras in the 23. verse of the 2. chapter, the Lord speaketh of the dayes under the Gospel,) he giveth this conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <note n="*" place="margin">Chr. plea ag. 78.</note> 
                  <hi>Thus now she is a wife, and not a wife: she is a wife, but a wife of whordoms, Hos.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>she is not a wife, that doth demeane her self loyally as she should, but hath her adulteries between her brests: Hos.</hi> 2. 2. And after a longer dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, he inferreth, <note n="†" place="margin">pag. 84.</note> 
                  <hi>But what is this to the point of the question in hand, which is not touching the condition afterward, but concerning their circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and estate, from the time of Ieroboams apostasie, whiles they were yet in the land. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. He keepeth his wont, to pretend the question other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weise then it is. The point was indefinite about the circumcision of Israel in their Apostasie. These were his own words, <note n="“" place="margin">

                  <hi>The bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of the church of Rome, is true baptisme, as the circumcision in Israels apostasie was true circumcision, and not to be repeated againe. And if it be not a true baptisme, it is a false baptisme</hi> &amp;c. He referred us not by any scripture, to their apostasie before or after they were put out of the land. I answered him in a few lines, and <note n="*" place="margin">Animadv. pag. 69.</note> shewed him from 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. &amp; <hi>Ezr.</hi> 6. 21. that there was no repeating of circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therfore not of baptisme. Those two scriptures he himself <note n="†" place="margin">Chr. plea pag. 28.</note> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so now urgeth against the Anabaptists: the latter wherof speaketh of a time long after their captivitie. Then I briefly referred him to 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 3. <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 2. &amp; 13. 1. to shew their synfull estate to be such, as that <note n="“" place="margin">

                  <hi>the ordinances of God which they in shew reteyned, could not be unto them the signes and seales of forgivenes, and of life eternal; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wire in their use of them false and deceytfull.</hi> Thus neyther he nor I, put any difference of their estate; though now he pleads it for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:23010:91"/>
in false churches, need not be rebaptised. So he hath written ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny leaves to plead for the whore Israel; but where shall we find this soundly concluded, which I denyed, that when they were not the Lords <hi>wife,</hi> nor he their <hi>husband;</hi> then in that estate (were it before or after their captivitie, let him take his choise,) their circumcision <hi>sealed unto them forgivenes of synns, and life eternal.</hi> This not being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he hath led his reader into a wood, where it would weary any man to folow him in his windings: and yet in the end, he shall not find that which his soule thirsteth after, touching their circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, when they were no longer the Lorde <hi>wife.</hi> Now to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, <hi>she is a wife, and she is not a wife:</hi> take it at the best, she is a wife of whordoms, a wife threatned to be stripped naked &amp;c. Where is the promise of forgivenes of her synns, unless she repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? And where is the testimony of her repentance? No where, (til Christ made the remnants of their posterity his wife, and his people, after they had been <hi>no people,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. 10.) but whiles they were in the land, they grew more hard, unbeleeving and unrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 13. 14. 15. &amp;c.

This is the thing that should be shewed, which is not to be seen in all his large discourse.</p>
               <p>And what help findeth he at the hands of the Chaldee para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase which he <note n="*" place="margin">Chr. plea pag. 86.</note> citeth thus, <hi>Rebuke the congregation of Israel, and say unto her, that she submitteth not her self to my worship, therfore neyther doth my</hi>

First it appeareth that the Paraphrast understood this of them whiles they were in the land, otherweise then he, which referreth it to their after state. Secondly, in that synfull estate whiles they worshiped or served not the Lord, but <hi>Idols</hi> (as after the Chaldee speaketh,) <hi>the Word</hi> of God, that is <hi>Christ</hi> (as himself expoundeth it) accepted not their prayers.

                     </gap> were the ordinances of God, reteyned among the Gentiles? Would any man of heart and understanding, endure such blasphemie? Sayth not the Scripture, that the church of Sardis, was one of the seven golden candlesticks? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. A man of understanding, wil discerne things that differ, and be caried by judgment, not by affection. The syn of Sardis, was secret hypocrisie, the syn of Ephraim was open idolatrie: the death of Sardis was discerned of Christ, (who <hi>searcheth</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 2. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>the heart &amp; reines:</hi>) the death of Ephraim, was discerned of men, who can judge but by the works. Sardis had <hi>a name</hi> among the churches, to be alive: when for the most part they were dead before God; though some things remayned which are but <hi>ready to dye, vers.</hi> 2. and a <hi>few</hi> among them, were worthy ones, and undefiled, vers. 4. Ephraim was openly knowen to be fallen from God to Baal, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and by the church of Iudah. Hypocrites in all true church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, are dead before God, though alive before men. So Simon Magus was alive in the judgment of the Apostolik church, and baptised therin, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. when before God he was dead. His bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme was true baptisme so farr as men could judge: though to himself before God, he received <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 9.</note> judgment therby, not being a worthy partaker. But had he been an open worshiper of Baal, and baptised or circumcised among the Baalists; it could not by men have been judged a true signe and seale of the forgivenes of his synns, he remayning unrepentant. They that should so affirme, should themselves not be farr from blasphemie, before men of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, that know upon what conditions the covenant of grace is made between God and men. They in Sardis that were dead, that is without true faith, (for by <note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 1. 17.</note> saith, the just doth live,)
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:23010:92"/>
could not by the sacraments or by any ordinance in the church be partakers of Christ, of his death or resurrection before God: so their baptisme was to them <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> no baptisme. And had they been so discerned of men, their baptisme should so have been judged by men. As the Canaanites in Sichem, <note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> their circumcision was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision, before men; and not the signe and seale of the <note n="“" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.</note> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes of faith, when they had no faith: for the unbeleever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth in the state of damnation, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 16. and the baptisme that saveth, is <hi>not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God,</hi> as th'Apostle suyth; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
               <p>That which he further annexeth, that I say <hi>their reasons from Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, might well serve for the times wherein John lived, when the</hi>

                     </gap>ther it will therfore follow, that Circumcision now in Israel was not the Lords signe and seale of his forgivenes of syn, but a false and deceitfull signe in their use therof, and no better then the ordinances of the heathen. For Christ sayd, Let the dead bury their dead &amp;c. Luke</hi> 9. 60. <hi>was circumcision then among the Iewes, a false and deceitfull signe in their life therof &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> He runneth into his former errour: the Iewish church in Christs time was a true church, and Christ communicated in their Temple and sacrifices: Israel when they served Baal, was a false church: and no man might awfully communicate with their Temple and sacrifices. Christ speaketh not of the Church gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, but of such as he knew to be hypocrites and dead, though seeming alive: we speak of Ephraim generally, open offenders, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Baal, and dead in the judgement of the Saincts. The same I answer to his next instance of the church of Ephesus, which then when Paul wrote, was not the house of Baal, but <hi>of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 15.

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> he excepteth, <hi>that Baals worship was first instituted by Achab, about 60. yeres after Ieroboam, and great difference was between Ieroboams calves, and Baals idolatrie &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is not material to our question, who spake of Israels circumcision in their apostasie in generall, before and after they were out of the land; as before I have manifested. 2. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Achabs syn was greater then Ieroboams, and false churches may grow worse and worse: yet Ieroboams calves, were also <hi>Divils,</hi> as the holy Ghost calleth them, 2. <hi>Chron. 11. 15.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> he instanceth, <hi>the 7000 in Israel, that bowed not the knee to Baal: 1. King. 19. 18.</hi> asking, <hi>what we shall say to these? were they not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised? or had they not the circumcision that was then in Jsrael? or was it not to them the Lords seale of forgivenes of synns? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The instance is good, to clear the controversie, by the help of other scriptures. In <hi>Rom. 11.</hi> Paul speaking of the rejection of the Iewes, sayth, <hi>Hath God cast away his people? Farr be it: For I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so am an Israelite &amp;c. God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew.</hi> Then speaking of Elias prayer against Israel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Gods answer, <hi>J have reserved to my self 7000. men, who have not bowed the knee to</hi> (the image of) <hi>Baal. Even so then</hi> (sayth <note n="†" place="margin">vers. 5.</note> he) <hi>at this present time also there is a remnant, according to the election of grace:</hi> &amp;c. By this we are taught, 1. That if a few, or any one of a people be reserved of God, though the multitude be cast away; yet it cannot be sayd absolutely, that God hath cast away his people. And this may lead us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, why God called Israel his people in their apostasie; because some he kept from falling into it, some he brought out of it by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. 2. That those are in deed Gods people, whom he <hi>foreknew:</hi> the rest are cast off. Now those which are foreknowen of God, are described thus, that <hi>he also did predestinate them to be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the image of his sont<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them he also called; them he also justified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them he also glorified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rom. 8. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

judge of their predestination, and estate in grace. 3. That as the remnant of the Iewes, which imbraced the gospel, were <hi>the election of grace,</hi> that is the people whom in charitie we should judge to be elected of God according to his grace; and the others are blinded, hardned, cast off, til God give them repentance: so in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, they that kept themselves from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon idolatrie of Baal, inwardly and outwardly, and reteyned the true service of God, were his election of grace, and to be judged his true people; the others that synned in Baal, were dead; til God gave them repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto life. Thus the Apostles exposition and application of those 7000. in Israel; may help us to judge of their estate aright. And not because circumcision was unto them the seale of grace and of forgivenes of synns; to conclude, that therfore it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weise to them that served Baal: for so we should prostitute Gods grace and the seals therof, to such as God condemneth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly</hi> he instanceth the worship of Baal by Iudah, <hi>Ier. 7. Judg. 2.</hi> &amp;c. Wherto I answer (as before) that Iudah in her constitution remayned a true church, though corrupted: Israel being a false church, as hath been manifested. Neyther was the defection uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall and open as in Israel. As for such in Iudah as so fell from God, and would not be brought to repentance, the Prophet tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them they <hi>trusted in lying words,</hi> when they sayd, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord</hi> &amp;c. Ier. 7. 4. 8. the Lord threatneth to cast them out of his sight, and forbad his Prophet to pray for them, <hi>Jer. 7. 15. 16.</hi> So their circumcision became unto them <hi>uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, Rom. 2. 25.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this he objecteth, <hi>Though mans idolatrie &amp;c may make Gods sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments improfitable to himself; yet can they not make them lying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull signes, but that in the Lords ordinance they are unto all and therfore also unto them, his true signes and faithfull seals (on his part) of forgivenes of synns and life eternal. For, shall the infidelitie of man, turne the truth of God into a lye? God forbid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Answ. I have before answered, that all Gods ordinances are in them selves, and on his part, holy faithfull and true.

                  <hi>Sixtly,</hi> he expoundeth Israels <hi>death</hi> in <hi>Hos. 13. 1.</hi> to be (by the exposition of sundry writers) not death in syn, but <hi>slayn</hi> for their synns; or their estate overthrowen, or neer utter destruction. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Both may be true; that first they were dead in syn, and after destroyed civilly for their syn. Gods judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are according to mens deserts; he destroyed not the Amorites, Egyptians, and other nations, til their iniquitie was full. Gen. 15. 16. Wherfore to condemne the exposition which I gave, because an other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent folowed upon it, as the ruine of Achabs house, or the like; is no fitme argument. And to his many expositors whom he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, I oppose one greater then all, even th'Apostle in <hi>Rom. 11.</hi> before spoken of: who sheweth the <hi>election of grace</hi> to be in the 7000 that worshiped not Baal: and not in the multitude of the Baalists. And if they were not of the election of grace, then were they dead in syn, though he and many say the contrary.</p>

                  <hi>Finally</hi> he alleageth the sayings of the Prophet before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>The Lord found Iakob in Bethel, and there he spake with us,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turne thou to thy God &amp;c.</hi> Hos. 12. 4. 5. 6. 9. And, <hi>yet am J the Lord thy God, from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no God but me. I did know thee in the wildernes &amp;c. Hose. 13. 4. 5.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I have before shewed, that the prophets speak to Israel, as a corporation or body, which after a sort continueth one and the same through many generations; when yet, as touching their particular persons or generations, they are different &amp; contrary; as godly fathers in the state of grace and life, may beget wicked children without grace, and in state of death. <hi>Ezek. 18. 9. 10. 13. 14. 17. 18.</hi> &amp;c. So the King of Tyre had been <hi>in Eden the garden of God,</hi> (a proselyte in the Church) Ezek. 28. 13. not that heathen king then living, but his predecessor Huram, long before. 1. King. 5. So Paul speaketh of the Iewes cast away of God, as the same peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, till their last calling, Rom. 11. And I doubt not, but a man

preaching to convert them at this day, might apply unto them the like sayings, <hi>I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt, thou shalt know no God but me: J led thee in the wildernes</hi> &amp;c. But alwayes in such ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral phrases, the promises of grace belong onely to such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and turne to the Lord: the others that remaine hardned, shall perish.</p>
               <p>And hitherto of his exceptions against the scriptures which I cited: although (as I shewed) if they had continued Gods true church in the land; yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were for obstinacie in their synns cast out of it, had the bill of divorce, were not the people or wife of the Lord: their circumcision could be no seale from God unto them of forgivenes of synns, &amp; eternal life, in that estate.</p>
               <p>That which after he prosequuteth touching the heathens state, I have answered before. And as for his other exceptions or repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions touching Israel; they are such as are before answered; and it is not a thing so necessarie to be insisted upon, touching their estate before they were cast out of the land; seing their circumcisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ages folowing, (when th'Apostle testifieth they were not a people, or partakers of Gods mercie, <hi>1.

                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:23010:95"/>1. God from the beginning, hath adjoyned signes or rites un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the promise of grace: which in the Church, are usually named Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>2. And Sacraments are signes of the eternal covenant between God and beleevers; that is to say, they are rites commanded of God unto the church, and added unto the promise of grace, that by them as by visible and sure testimonies, God may signifie and testifie, that unto them that use these symbols in true faith, he communicateth Christ and all his benefits, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the gospel; and so may confirme in them, the confidence of the promise; and that the church may by these visible notes, be discerned from all other sects &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 31. 14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2. 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Ioh.</hi>

                  <p>3. Rites which are not commanded of God, or not instituted to this end, for to be signes of the promises; are no Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>8. The lawfull use of the sacraments is, when they that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted (to the Lord) doe keep those rites which God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, to those ends for which they were instituted sacraments of God. Proof. That onely is the lawful use, which agreeth with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine institution. And the institution comprehendeth these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of persons, rites, and ends. If these therefore be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, the signes are abused, <hi>Esai.</hi> 1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.</p>
                  <p>9. In this use, the things signified, are alwayes received togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the signes: <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 16.</p>
                  <p>10. But out of the use instituted of God, which is not without conversion (unto him); the ceremonies have no respect of a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, neyther are Gods benefits (signified by them,) received with the signes. Proof. The signes of the covenant, confirme nothing to them which keep not the covenant, or which substitute other things in their place; or which referr them to another end. But Sacraments are signes of the covenant, wherby God bindeth himself to give us forgivenes of synns and life eternal freely for Christs sake: and bindeth us to shew forth faith &amp; new obedience. Therfore they confirme not Gods grace to those which use them without faith and repentance, or that use other rites, or to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end then God hath instituted. Moreover it is superstitious and idolatrous, to attribute the testimonie of Gods grace, eyther to the outward work without the promise, or to a work divised of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:23010:95"/>
men. Therfore this abuse of the Sacramentes, hath not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gods grace joyned with it, neyther confirmeth it to any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is sayd, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 25. Circumcision profiteth if thou keep the Law: but if thou be a transgressor of the Law, thy circumcision is made uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision.</p>
                  <p>11. The godly, doe receive the signes unto salvation; the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, unto condemnation: but the things signified, can onely the godly receive unto salvation. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>Esa.</hi> 66. 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 17.</p>
                  <p>12. Yet in the elect, though they have received the sacrament unworthily, the fruit foloweth at length after they are converted. Proof. The promise, and the signes of the promise which hath the condition of faith added to it, are confirmed, whensoever the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is performed. And such is the promise, which is signified and confirmed by the sacraments. Therfore whether faith (which beleeveth the promise and signes) cometh eyther in the use, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the use; the promise and things signified are received. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 69.</p>

                  <p>Answ. The second proposition may be denyed, touching them that are not converted. For to such, the sacraments are no sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that is, signes of grace; especially seing they turne them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mere idols. But they are made sacraments unto them, that is, signes of grace, when (the Papists) are converted.
