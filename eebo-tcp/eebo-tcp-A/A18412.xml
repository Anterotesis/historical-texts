            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to offer vp my poore mite, to the honour of the late Nuptials; betwixt the two most Noble personages, whose honored names renown the front of my Poeme) singled out (as in some parts harmelesly, and gracefully applicable to the occasion) The Nuptials of <hi>Perseus</hi> and <hi>Andromeda,</hi> an innocent and spotlesse virgine, rescu'd from the polluted throate of a monster; which I in this place applied to the sauage multitude; peruerting her most lawfully-sought propagation, both of blood and blessing, to their owne most lawlesse and lasciuious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions: from which in all right she was legally and formally deliuered.

               </gap>oro'st into her, by her poisonous enemy to sting her to death. But the allusion (you will say) may be extended so farre; but <hi>qui nimium emulget elicet sanguinem</hi>; a malicious reader by straining the Allegorie past his intentionall limits, may make it giue blood, where it yeeldes naturally milke, and ouercurious wits may discouer a sting in a flie: But as a guiltlesse prisoner at the barre sayd to a Lawyer thundring against his life, <hi>Num quia tu disertus es, ego peribo?</hi> because malice is witty, must Innocence be condemned? Or if some other, not sufficiently exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what I haue written, shall by mistaking the title,
<pb facs="tcp:15089:5"/>
suppose it carrie such an vnderstanding; doth any Law therfore cast that meaning vpon me? Or doth any rule of reason make it good, that let the writer meane what he list, his writing notwithstanding must be construed <hi>in mentem Legentis?</hi> to the intendment of the Reader? If then, for the mistaking of an enuious or vnskilfull Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who commonly being <hi>praeiudicia pro iudicijs,</hi> I shal be exposed to the hate of the better sort, or taken for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciblie into any powerfull displeasure, I shall esteeme it an acte as cruell and tyranous, as that of the Emperour, who put a Consul to death for the errour of a publique Crier; misnaming him Emperour in stead of Consul. For my selfe I may iustly say thus much, that if my whole life were layd on the racke, it could neuer accuse me for a <hi>Satyrist</hi> or <hi>Libeller,</hi> to play with worthie mens reputations; or if my vaine were so addicted, yet could I so farre be giuen ouer, as without cause or end, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture on personages of renownd nobilitie? hauing infallible reason to assure my selfe, that euen those most honoured personages, to whose graces I chiefly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded these labors, might they but in the lest degree haue suspected any such allusion by me purposed, as is now most iniuriously surmised against me, they would haue abhorred me and banisht me their sight. To conclude <hi>Hic Rhodus, hic saltus</hi>; as I said of my life, so of my lines; heere is the Poeme; let euerie sillable of it be tortured by any how partiall and preiudicate so euer (for as the case
