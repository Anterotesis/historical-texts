         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

who under the name of <hi>Gods vvorſhip,</hi> doe cauſe many people to
worſhip Satan and Antichriſt; And that men may the eaſier and
ſooner be perſwaded to it; they ſet forth their lies and vanities
in as plauſible &amp; faire away as can be.</p>
            <p>What man would ſeeme to deale ſo plainly as a <hi>Iugter:</hi> Hee will
ſtrike up his ſleeves and make bare his armes, and open his hands
and fingers, and lay all things before thee, and bid thee behold,
and thou wouldſt thinke him to be a man of a faire carriage, and
not imagine thou couldſt poſſiblie be deceived; And yet indeed,
his whole ſkill and ſeeking, is nothing elſe but to deceive, and the
more ſimplie and plainly he would ſeeme to deale, the ſooner and
eaſier he doth beguile thee. For thou ſhalt thinke thou ſeeſt all,
and ſeeſt nothing; Feeleſt it ſenceablie with thy fingers, holdeſt
it faſt, canſt not looſe it, and yet ſhall open thy hand and finde
nothing.</p>
            <p>The paſſages of ſome men, in points of Religion, are carried
much after ſuch a ſort: For one would thinke, to heare the ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of their tale, and what integritie and plainnes they doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe;
That it is all Goſpell they ſpeake, and that their cauſe, is
cleare, and nothing is to be ſaid to the contrarie: Notwithſtanding
when another comes forth, and replies againſt them, rips up their
tale, weighs their reaſons, diſcloſeth the errour and weaknes of
their pleading. Men wonder at their owne ſimplicitie and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and that ever they ſhould be ſo fond as to beleeve them.
But ſeeing I am now to deale only in the point of <hi>hearing of falſe
Miniſters:</hi>
I will not therefore ſtep out of the beaten way to take
in any by-diſcourſe; Only I thinke good to certifie, that I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,
that ſuch men who walke not as we doe in <hi>Church-way,</hi> but
thinke us to cenſorious and <hi>over juſt:</hi> Why they doe not publickly
anſwer our grounds and arguments publiſhed to the world, and ſo
prove their <hi>nevv Principles</hi> in as faire and open a way; that either
<pb facs="tcp:15565:4"/>
we may come to them, finding them to walke more agreeable to
the Scriptures, or ſhew our reaſons to the contrarie.</p>
            <p>For the matter here in controuerſie: That the <hi>Reader</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
the more by it, there are 5 things, which J deſire him to doe.
1. When thou ſetteſt thy ſelfe to read, ſet thy ſelfe as in Gods
preſence, looke on with a ſingle and impartiall eye; weigh the
arguments well on both ſides, not by ſhewes and ſhifts, but by the
juſt Ballance of the incorruptible and unchangable Word of God;
In judging, judge I beſeech thee righteous judgment; and let the
truth be deare to thy ſoule; and doe not ſide with any ſide, becauſe
thy minde gives thee, it leadeth moſt to eaſe, credit, profit plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
or ſuch wordly reſpects, but to that which moſt tendeth to
the glorie of Gods great name, the purity of religion, and to the
moſt comfort and peace of thy own conſcience.</p>
            <p>2. I would have thee to <hi>live by thy owne faith,</hi> and not build upon
anothers fancie, it is a great fault in ſome, in that they ſee nothing,
but by other mens eyes. What this man, or ſuch a man holdeth, that
is their beleife; And beſides this, they can give no more reaſon
for what they hold, then the Parrat of her ſpeaking. I need not
goe farre for proofe; The point in controverſie cleares it ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For as one<note n="‡" place="margin">Galen: Claſ. 2. lib. de cuiuſq: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimi pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> notitia at que me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dela.</note> well ſaith: <hi>That which a credible perſon telleth, is
eaſilie thought credible by ſuch as are well perſwaded of him.</hi> What
hath drawn many unto this practice of <hi>Hearing unlawfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters?</hi>
But taking the thing upon truſt, without due triall and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.
Sure I am, had men meaſured it by the <hi>Goulden Read</hi>
of the Scriptures, they would ſoon have perceived, that it was
never ſet apart by Gods appointment, for the <hi>ſpirituall building.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Be not wiſe in thy ovvne eyes.</hi> But rather deny thy ſelfe in thy
own <hi>judgment, vvill, affection, reaſon,</hi> &amp;c. And be contented to bee
guided by the alone Word of God. What is the reaſon that ſome
men doe ſeeke after the truth, as a coward doth his enemie, loath
to find him? But becauſe loving their owne conceit (as <hi>Apes</hi> their
yong ones) beyond meaſure, they are not willing to heare of any
thing that is ſaid againſt it.</p>
            <p>We ſee in nature, he that will heare well, muſt ſtopp his breath;
It is ſo in things ſpirituall: if a man will not <hi>keep in his breath,</hi> I
meane ſet aſide <hi>conceitednes</hi> &amp; <hi>ſelfe-love,</hi> &amp; be willing to embrace
the truth, though it be contrarie to that which he formerly held he
ſhall not profit by any thing, he heareth or readeth, but like <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roahs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

kine</hi> remaine lean &amp; ilfavored ſtill.</p>
            <p>Things in the earth will grow as they find roome; A Light in
the dampes of mines, goeth out: Thus ſtands the caſe with men,
<pb facs="tcp:15565:5"/>
when any good helpe is pur into their hands: If their hearts then,
be free of ſelfe-love, ſpirituall pride, perſonall prejudice, baſe deſire
of vaine glorie and humaine applauſe, &amp;c. They will profit by
it; Contrariwiſe if their hearts, like a <hi>deepe hole,</hi> be full of thoſe
filthy <hi>Foggs</hi> &amp; <hi>Miſts,</hi> the truth then (how clearely ſoever it ſhine)
will dampe &amp; quench in them, as a light in the mines of the earth.</p>

                  </expan> conſult:</note> Whereas the <hi>Civil Lavv</hi> ſaith, <hi>it is uncivil for any man not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
vveighed the vvhole Lavv, to give advice or judgement ſome one
parcel of it, alone propoſed.</hi> I doe therefore intreat the Reader, to
forbeare his Cenſure, till he have read the whole booke over. And
if it be ſo, that he thinkes, in ſome point I have erred (as who liveth
&amp; erreth not) I would not have him, for ſuch a particular fayling
to condemne the whole. But let that beare its owne burden, and
let the reſt be received, as (after due trial) the ſame ſhalbe found
agreeable to the Word of God.</p>
            <p>I ſpeake not this, as beeing privy to any known crime this way;
But becauſe I am privy to many known wants &amp; great weakneſſes
in my ſelfe. Beſides, it is the manner of ſome, if they can ſpy ſome
thing not well handled in another mans writing, to take ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
as hereby they ſeeke to bring the whole under reproofe
and condemnation. Of this ſhalbe all their talke, at this they will
gird and jeſt; not beeing able in the meane time to take away the
force of any one of the maine arguments. Neither indeed dare to
attempt it, but like the ſnaile keepe in their hornes.</p>
            <p>5. I thinke good to ſpeake here a little concerning the manner
of this anſwer. And that no man may be offended as it; I doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
in the Word of truth, that it hath much greeved me all along
the diſcourſe, to ſpeake ſo much of the <hi>Treatiſer,</hi> whoſe learning I
doe much reverence; But the cauſe beeing the Lords, and I ſeeing
how much it lay upon me, to take away the <hi>Maſkes</hi> and <hi>viſards,</hi>
whereby many have been deceived, I have done my beſt to ſhew
the abſurdities, contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, unſkilfulnes &amp; daungerouſnes of that
<hi>Treatiſe.</hi> And for this <hi>not ſparing</hi> but ſpeaking home, I have had
ſome reaſons for it, as partly here follow.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe the Booke containes a pernitious &amp; moſt hurtfull er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
and by how much it is caried forth, under a colourable ſhew
of a <hi>pious and godly practice,</hi> by ſo much the more hath it cauſed
many greevious &amp; long laſting miſeries. I know there are many
viler errours dayly maintained; But if we reſpect mens walking
in the <hi>Holie Order of the Goſpell,</hi> this is a main ſtumbling block &amp;
barre in the way to it: There are ſome humours, which ſome
where placed in the body, are quiet and doe little hurt, but in
<pb facs="tcp:15565:5"/>
other places, ſpecially in the paſſage, they doe much miſchiefe. This <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi>
is as a <hi>corrupt humour,</hi> fallen into the <hi>paſſage</hi> of the bodie, the
Church; and therefore it muſt needs be the more perilous.</p>
            <p>2. I have ſpoken the more plainely againſt it, becauſe they ſay, there
are manie in England and in other Countries, who hold it unlawfull to
be preſent at their <hi>divine ſervice,</hi> and to receive the Sacraments in the
<hi>Pariſh-Churches;</hi> and yet thinke it lawfull to heare the Miniſters of that
Church. Now, if ſuch men have (as had <hi>David)</hi> tender hearts, and
hearts that will ſmite them for a little; They will ſurely come off from
this too. Seeing I have here proved, that the ground they build on, is
very ſand, and their pleading for it, wants both Religion &amp; reaſon.</p>
            <p>3. Such a general fame is gone forth of the booke, as to be ſo learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; abſolutely done, that it gives all men ſatisfaction (ſome few riged
ſpirits only excepted) &amp; that no man would ever be able to make any
ſound reply to it. And for my ſelfe, I have been by name chalenged
(as it were) to anſwer, with much baſe inſulation, as if I d urſt rather
eate my pen, then put my pen to write againſt it. And this both before
my thoughts were ſetled on thing, and ſince too. Now, whether the
worke be according to the praiſe of it, let all indifferent men judge.</p>
            <p>4. Seeing it is given out (but me thinkes it ſhould not be true) that
there are ſome learned men, which plead for the <hi>Hearing of falſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters;</hi>
and upon the <hi>Treat.</hi> grounds; I have therefore diſcovered the
ſleightnes of it (to ſay no worſe) the more: That ſuch (if there be any
ſuch) may ſee their errour; If not, reply if they pleaſe &amp; when they wil.</p>
            <p>But for the perſon, or perſons that ſhall reply; Theſe 3 things I deſire
may be conſidered: 1. That they change not the ſtate of the queſtion;
which is not, whether it be lawfull to heare the <hi>Miniſters of the church
of England,</hi> or of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of any Church; But taking it granted, <hi>a
Church to be falſe, &amp; the Miniſterie Antichriſtian; vvhether Hearing in
ſuch a caſe be lawfull;</hi> For the queſtion now ſtands thus, &amp; no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>2. J exſpect an anſwer, in a more honeſt &amp; fairer way, then I had the
laſt time namly, by a <hi>ſort of gnats,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">It hath bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as I heare, that I ſhould anſwere <hi>dead me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> now how ſo ever it is wel known that my former booke was both finiſh ed and at the <hi>Preſſe,</hi> before <hi>Dr. Ames</hi> death: yet ſay I had writen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death: doe not all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know, that in points of differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the matter it ſelf, &amp; no to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide holding the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <q>Quod tibi vis fieri, hoc facias &amp; alteri.</q>
            <p>Indeed it is a very unbeſeeming thing, that men who doe profeſſe
Religion &amp; learning, ſhould diſgrace other mens worke, behinde their
backs, ſhunning in the meane time the open light, whereby their deeds
might be made manifeſt. As for ſuch <hi>Replyers,</hi> whoſe arguments are
<hi>Trencher-ſquibs,</hi> and reach only as farr as to the end of the table<note n="‡" place="margin">Not ſoe farr as to pen, Inke &amp; paper, to anſwer in a faire &amp; honeſt way.</note>; well
they may ſatisfie men of the ſame humours; But with men fearing God
they ſhall finde no acceptance.</p>
            <p>3. I exſpect plaine dealing; Truth is like the <hi>glaſſie ſea before the throne,</hi>
which is bright, cleare, not a clouded bodie or covered with the vailes
of mens fond fantiſies &amp; dreames. Let ſuch Childiſh toyes be kept for
Children. <hi>I require the voyce of the Shepheard, read it me out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

            <p>Before I end my ſpeach, I thinke good to mention <hi>you my Brethren,</hi>
with whom I am in ſpeciall communion, &amp; <hi>over vvhom the Holy Ghoſt

<hi>fallacies &amp; fantaſies</hi> newly broached, I deſire all the Churches of God,
here to take knowledge off, for our clearing &amp; juſtification.</p>
            <p>I thought when J firſt began with this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> in ending of it, to
have ended with publick controverſies; and ſo have followed a more
quiet kind of ſtudie; But ſeeing, what the <hi>truth</hi> ſuffers in regard of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries

&amp; ſineſteriores,</hi> adverſaries on both hands, &amp; to deliver it from the evill

            <p>You know (my Brethren) <hi>for the diviſions of Reuben are great thoughts

Schiſmes amongſt us. In truth, I doe not know, for what our profeſſion,

may no longer ſuffer, but the ſinne &amp; ſhame lie where it ought; I will by

Howbeit, in their opinions very corrupt, &amp; how. Againe, how farre
particular men have libertie to deale with a Church; &amp; when they are
to reſt, &amp; how, a why; Moreover, how farre a Church-Covenant binds
every member of the body to that bodie; &amp; wherefore there muſt not
be diviſions, neither from, nor in the bodie. Againe, in caſe there be a
diviſion in Church, I wil ſhew by what ſignes &amp; tokens, the Church may

                  <p>It is all one whether a man communicate with the miniſter in his
pulpit or with the Chauncelor in his conſiſtory, both of them minister
by the ſame power of the Biſhop. The Chauncelor may iudge justly,
&amp; who knowes whither or no the Miniſter will teach truely? And if
he doe not, but ſpeak the viſion of his owne heart, what remedy hath
the Church, or what can they that hear him do? May they rebuke
him openly according to his ſin, and ſo bring him to repentance? or
muſt they not beare his errors yea his hereſyes alſo during the pleaſure
of the Biſhops, even their Lord, &amp; his?</p>
                  <p>And would you Mr. B. be content your people ſhould heare a maſſe-Priest
or Jeſuite, though he profeſſed as loud as you do, that he would
teach the true word of God? And think not ſcorne of the match, for you
haue the ſelfe ſame office with a maſſe Preiſt though refyned. If he
be ordayned by a Biſhop (though it be the Biſhop of Rome) he may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
in any Church of England by vertue of that ordination. And<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſides
maſſe-Preiſts preach ſome and thoſe the mayne truthes, and the
Miniſters in England neither do nor dare preach all, no nor ſome which
(it may be) the others do.</p>
                  <p>Is it not better then for the ſervants of the L. Ieſus to exerciſe and
aedify themſelves according to the model of grace receaved, though in
weaker meaſure, then to be ſo ſimple as to come to your feaſts, though
you cry never ſo loud vnto them, thinking that becauſe your ſtoln
waters are ſweet, and your hidden bread pleaſant, that they have no
power to paſſe by, but muſt needs become your gueſts?</p>
                  <p>And here (to uſe the <hi>Piſtlers</hi> words,) it is wel to be marked

                  <p>THat the Church here pleaded for, is Antichriſtian and falſe:
the <hi>Epiſt:</hi> doth acknowledge. Yet (ſaith he) <hi>that worſhipping
of God, which conſiſteth in hearing his Word, is warrantable
for us to doe there:</hi> And ſo much he undertakes to prove by
this Argument.</p>
                  <p>That Preaching which ordinarily begits men to the faith of Chriſt,
may lawfully be heard.</p>
                  <p>But the Preaching of many Miniſters in the Church of England
hath and doth ordinarily beget men to the faith of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Preaching of many Miniſters in England may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
be heard.</p>
                  <p>The firſt part of this ſillogiſme is proved out of Rom. 10. Where
the Apoſtle telling what is the ordinary way God uſed to beget men
to the faith of Chriſt telles us, it comes by hearing of the word of God
preached, if faith comes by hearing the Word of God preached (to wit,
if that be the outward meanes) then there is no queſtion but that a man
may heare ſuch preaching, and any man may bluſh for ſhame, that
ſhall deny this: So that the major part of the Argument is
cleare:</p>
                  <p>And for the Minor parte they can not deny it, no more then a
man at noon day can deny the ſunne to ſhine: for if any man make
queſtion whether faith comes ordinarily by the preaching and hearing
in England, it is a great queſtion whether they euer had faith or no:
yet becauſe ſome are ſo groſſe as to deny this, we will therefore: proue
the contrarie by this Argument: Ne puero gladium.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>That preaching and hearing which makes them which were
altogether carnal, &amp; ſo not capable of a church eſtate, to become
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:15565:19"/>
ſaints &amp; ſo fit for a church-eſtate: That preaching muſt needs
beget men to the faith.</p>
                     <p>But the preaching and hearing in England, made them that
were unfit and carnall to become ſaints, and ſo fit members to
the true Church, which were not ſo before.</p>
                     <p>Therefore the preaching in England and hearing the ſame
doth beget men to the faith. That the preaching and hearing in
England hath done this: Witneſſe the Church of Leyden and

3. The maine drift and ſcope of his reaſon, is not onlie untrue; But
indeed very daungerous, to ſay no worſe of it, as rending to reſtraine
people from hearing the true Miniſters of Chriſt. And that this is
ſo, I prove it thus. That preaching which hath not, or doth not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
begit men to the Faith of Chriſt, may not lawfully be heard.
But the preaching of many true Miniſters in their Congregations
neither hath, nor doth ordinarily begit men to the Faith of Chriſt;
Ergo, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>If his Argument in the affirmative be true: <hi>Tam forma, quam ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria;</hi>
To ſay nothing of mood and figure. Then in the <hi>negative</hi> this
is true alſo, according to that knowne rule, <hi>parium par eſt ratio:</hi> There
is alike reaſon of things alike. So in the Philoſopher:<note n="b" place="margin">Arist: Eth: c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Contrariorum
eſt eadem ratio.</hi> For inſtance, let it be in the affirmative thus; <hi>The
godly pleaſe God;</hi> Muſt it not on the contrarie follow: <hi>The ungodly
diſpleaſe God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To applie this: If this be a reaſon and ground, why ſome Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
ought to be heard; Namely, becauſe true converſion ordinarily
followeth their Miniſterie. If this [I ſay] be a main cauſe that they
ſhould be heard; Then ſurely it muſt follow: Where ſuch effects of
ordinary converſion appeare not; There muſt be no hearing. I ſay
ſuch Miniſters are to be rejected, be they in their places never ſo pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and conſcionable.</p>
                  <p>This being ſo, marke the inference: <hi>Noah</hi> preached a 120 yeares,
and yet there followed no ordinarie converſion in the old World.
The like may be ſaid of <hi>Elias, Iſaiah, Ieremie, Ezechiel,</hi> and other
Prophers; Therefore it was not lawfull to heare them.</p>
                  <p>Hath not the <hi>Piſt:</hi> here ſhewed himſelfe an acute diſputer; For
to build <hi>Babel,</hi> he puls downe <hi>Bethel;</hi> To juſtifie falſe Prophets, he
condemnes the true. In a word, whiles he ſeekes to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a doore unto

Courts of the Lord of Hoaſt. Had he thought on the Wiſemans<note n="c" place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>4. For the proofe of his <hi>Major,</hi> there is not one ſound ſentence in
it.</p>
                  <p>For 1. touching the <hi>diſdiapaſon</hi> or il-favoured coupling of the
matter. The Scripture he alleadgeth is <hi>Rom. 10, verſ. 17. Fayth
commeth by hearing the Word of God.</hi> Now, what of this? His Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hence is not proved, neither doth this place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. look that

is by hearing the lawfull Miniſters of the Goſpell; Then may unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Miniſters be heard; If he can make it hang otherwiſe, he were
beſt to doe it, and ſave his credit what he can.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Paul <hi>Rom.</hi> 10, ſpeaketh of the ordinarie way, which God
hath ordained to begit faith; But the practice here ſtood for by the

many divine precepts; Alſo the Example and practice of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
from the firſt age of the word hitherto. Beſides, this is <hi>a

not only <hi>(they ſay)</hi> lawfull, but in ſome caſes neceſſary for all, of all
Sects and ſorts of Chriſtians, having opportunity and occaſion of ſo
doing.</p>
                  <p>This indeed they ſay? But how prove they it to be true? Not by
any law of God taken out of the old or new Teſtament: For that
they cannot doe; Not by any holy mans Example, for they know
there is none extant? Not by any ſound conſequence rightly drawne
from the Scripture, for <hi>(quid ſi Caelum ruat</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>They deviſe certaine obſtruſe, darke and ambiguous phraſes and
diſtinctions: As</hi> of naturall hearing in a Church, and of a hearing
wherein there is Communion: Of ſome Churches, falſe in respect of
order: Others in reſpect of fayth and order: of hearing falſe Miniſters,
not (quatenus) as they are falſe Miniſters, or their Miniſters, but as
men gyfeed and the Biſhops Miniſters: of certaine effects which

Thus their proofes are only their bare and bould affirmation: For
leaving the Scriptures, they uſe Paralogiſmes, fond cavils, and falſe
arguments. The which courſe not only ſhewes an il caſe, but alſo
manifeſteth, that the embracers thereof, are either ignorant people
who cannot judge of things that differ, or ſome, that have ſome <hi>mens

For unles it be only wind and vanitie, theſe ſweet collections muſt

                  <p>THe <hi>Pist:</hi> having done with his <hi>Logick:</hi> comes in the next

and ſpeaking little better then Blasphemy.</hi> A great fault,
if true; But how doth he prove it? <hi>They ſay, it is not
the Word of God, as it is preached in Antichriſtian Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſw. The <hi>Publiſh:</hi> had done well, if he had publiſhed out aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>(de manu in manum,)</hi> truely and faithfully. But ſeeing he hath
not done ſo, I will here lay it downe; Thus it is: <hi>The word preched
by falſe Miniſters, is not that word unto which God hath promiſed a
blèſſing of increaſe. Or it is not the ordinary way and meanes which
the Scriptures speakes of, to begit men to the faith.</hi> Had he ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
it, he might well have held his tongue, and not talke ſo vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as he doth, <hi>of Gods Word, if Mr. Canne ſhall preach it; And none
of Gods Word, if another doe preach the ſame.</hi> For our difference
is not about the <hi>Word</hi> ſimply, as it ſtands in ſillables and letters; But
rather in reſpects the time and place preached in, and the perſons
preached by and to; That is, as the one beeing an ordinance of Chriſt,
the other of Antichriſt; As the one (that is the word preached in a
lawfull office) beeing like <hi>Mount Gerizim</hi> under the <hi>bleſſing;</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
like <hi>Mount Ebol</hi> under the <hi>curſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will expreſſe this paticular more fully in this manner, put the

no man can denie but this is the Kings Law which they have, yet as
they adminiſter it, ſo it is not his Law, or more plainly, that is not his
Law, which they adminiſter, neither may any good ſubject in ſuch
a caſe receive any adminiſtration at their hands.</p>
                  <p>The holy Veſſels in Babilon were the Lords ſtill, yet the Iſraelites
there, might not make any religious uſe of them; So in ſpirituall Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon,
the Bible there is Gods Booke; Nevertheleſſe the Godly are
forbidden to goe thether, to heare it, either read or taught to
them.</p>
                  <p>We finde under the Law a difference between the Creatures, ſome
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15565:25"/>

for ſo nothing is evill or uncleane; (for <hi>all Gods Workes were

                     <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 1. ult.</note> But in reſpect of the uſe forbidden: So thouching <hi>Gods

Not but the Word in itſelfe is ſtill good and true. The difference is,
becauſe of Gods Commaundement, he having as flatly forbidden the
uſe of it (taught or heard) in falſe Churches, as he did ſome beaſts
under the Law.<note n="b" place="margin">I would haue the Piſt: to tell me, what contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie, or blaſphemy it is to ſay: though Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf were of God: yet as it was uſed in the falſe Church under the Kings of Iſrael: It was none of Gods ordinance; If was Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, if a true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister in Gods Church admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred it; But if a Prieſt of Ieroboams making did adminiſter the ſame, It was none of Gods Ordinance.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I wiſh therefore the <hi>Reader,</hi> to note in what reſpect we place our
difference, between the Word preached in a true Church and in a
falſe Church; We ſay in the one (that is in the true Church) it is
cleane. In the other, we ſay it is not: Nevertheleſſe, if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
as God is the authour of the whole Scripture; And as it
containes words and ſentences, ſo we ſay, it is all cleane and good;
The reaſon then, why we ſay their preaching is uncleane, is in the
ſame reſpect, that ſome creatures were uncleane under the Law;
Namely, in reſpect of the uſe forbidden.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>the tree of knowledge of good and evill,</hi> hurt not of itſelfe, I
mean the <hi>fruit,</hi> but the tranſgreſſion after the commaundement, the
thing in itſelfe good, but the uſe forbidden; So Gods Word in falſe
Churches (as that <hi>fruit)</hi> in itſelfe is good, but the uſe there prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the <hi>Publiſh:</hi> takes it ſo ill, that any difference ſhould
be put between <hi>the ſame word preached in Bethel and Babilon.</hi> I
will (to appeaſe him) adde one word more. As a falſe and forged
<hi>Conſtitution,</hi> makes a Church a reall and ſubſtanciall <hi>Idoll;</hi> So all that
comes from it, is touched with the Idolatry of that <hi>Conſtitution.</hi>
This is a ruled opinion of many Divines, the <hi>State</hi> makes all the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
actions to be formally good or evill; For as the <hi>Temple</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Matt. 23, 17, 19.</note>
                     <hi>ſanctifieth the gould, the Altar the offrings;</hi> So the ordinances of
the Church under the Goſpell, are ſanctified to us; That is (as <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">In Mat, 23, v. 17.</note> truely ſpeaketh) in the uſe of them made lawfull to us, in that
they have their <hi>Ryſe,</hi> from a true and right <hi>Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seeing then the Church in Queſtion, wants a right <hi>Conſtitution,</hi>
it muſt follow, that all ſpirituall actions done in it, (whether prayer,
preaching Sacraments, Cenſures) as they are there done, are none
of Gods ordinances; though true it is, in themſelves they are of God.
Yet I ſay, as the Word is there preached, the Sacraments there ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:15565:25"/>
&amp;c. So they are not his; I ſay not his, though in outward

                  <p>Another thing for which he blames his <hi>Oppoſites,</hi> is, their miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying

                  <p>It was true incenſe which Nadab and Abihu tooke, to offer up to
the Lord, but becauſe they tooke ſtrange fire; and not the fire which
was from the Altar, as the Lord had appointed, therefore the Lord
ſent a fire to deſtroy them: So ſay they, it is the true Word of God,
which is preached in England, but becauſe they preach the ſame by an
unlawfull office, therefore the Lord abhorres it: A ſtranger collection
I thinke can hardly be heard, for here ſtrange fire is oppoſed to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
outward calling; which nothing can be more abſurd, for Nadab
and Abihu had a true outward calling to Offer, they were the ſonnes
of Aaron (ſaith the text) therefore if any thing hence might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
in just proportion, it muſt be to the Doctrine taught, and
not in the leaſt to the calling: So that we may from thence gather thus
much, that if a Miniſter in regard of his outward calling true: ſhall
teach any thing that is not from the Lord, they are to expect Gods
judgement for the ſame, and more cannot hence be collected.</p>

To heare Antichristian Miniſters in their unlawfull aſſemblies

may even then be heard, and yet no honour, no approbation,

therein.</p>
                  <p>5. It is vitious and ſuperſtitious to ſimbolize with idolaters;
The Scriptures<note n="*" place="margin">Levit. 18, 3. Deu. 12. 30. Exo. 23. 24. 2 Chro. 13 9. Levit. 19. 27. 28</note> forbidd it. And the Saints in all ages have care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſhund it, as we ſhall ſhew in another place. But this Hearing
is no other; For idolaters in this, are imitated in ſundry acts of
their idolatrie; In ſo much as <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts</hi> too, may well
twitt our <hi>balters</hi> in the words of the Samaritane woman, how is it
that thou beeing a Chriſtian joyneſt thy ſelfe to us Antichriſtians?
Is it not ſtrange that thou who profeſſeſt our Church to be falſe,
our Miniſterie unlawfull, our Church-government Popiſh,
ſhouldeſt yet come to us, and pertake in our adminiſtrations?
Surely this argueth, that either thou underſtandeſt not the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
which thy grounds lead thee too, or elſe for ſome by reſpect;
refuſeſt to walke accordingly to them.</p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Superſtition</hi> is committed, when more eſtimation is had of a

firſt upon this point of Hearing, ſpake as he thought of it, and
did nothing but what his minde gave him to be right and
good: But this makes not the thing therefore juſtifiable; For
as <hi>Martyr</hi> ſaith:<note n="b" place="margin">Lex Dei is regula conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae. Loc. Comm. Claſſ. 2. cap. 1. pag. 165.</note>

an occaſion whereby many people have turned aſide from
the ſtreaght wayes of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>2. I doe not ſee what ſatisfaction any man can have from his
writing: Seeing he hath not alleadged any one Sentence of
Scripture to prove the point in queſtion lawfull. <hi>Omne quod
loquimur, debemus affirmare de Scriptur is Sanctis:</hi> ſaith <hi>Hierom

And here by the way, let me ſpeake a word to you, whoſe
warrant for your going unto unlawfull Aſſemblies, is only the
<hi>Treatiſers</hi> writing: This J doe affirme and will make good againſt
all gainſayers, that if the thing could be juſtified, yet for his part he
hath not proved it ſo, but hath left the point it ſelfe wholy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd,
and taken up a by-thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore what</hi> Alcibiades <hi>ſaid of the</hi> Athenians, <hi>I may well

God: and for that he ſeekes to build againe the thing which hee
had before deſtroyed. What he hath ſaid againſt this <hi>Hearing,</hi> the
World is not ignorant of; and therefore here is a fitt place to lay
downe his own words, &amp; to apply them to himſelf: <hi>He ſucks up his
former breath; and eates the words he had formerly uttered, as
though he had either forgotten what he wrote before, or cared not
how he croſſed himſelfe, ſo he might oppoſe us.</hi>

he meant no ſtreaning of a good conſcience; If he did not, then
his counſell is of no uſe at all: except it could be proued, that the

                     <hi>THE</hi> Objections <hi>undertaken to be anſwered by the</hi>
Treatiſer, <hi>are (as he layes them downe)</hi> of two ſorts:
Some of them are framed upon ſuppoſition, that the
Ministers in that Church are in themſelves Lawfull and
of God; But yet not to be heard by reaſon of the abuſes &amp; evils
to be found in their administrations. Others with-draw herein
(and thoſe the more) upon the contrarie ſuppoſition: to wit, that
the very order and conſtitution of that Church and Miniſtery is
papall and unlawfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſvv.</hi> For the firſt I have nothing to ſay to it. It beeing a
point beſide our preſent diſpute. Againe, for my part, I am of
his minde in the thing: that is, to uſe his owne expreſſion:</p>
                  <p>Suppoſing a Church, and the Miniſterie, thereof eſſentially
lawfull, it cannot but be lawfull for the members of other Churches
in generall union, and aſſociation, with it to communicate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
in things lawfull, and lawfully done: ſeeing the end of union
is communion. God hath in vaine united perſons, and ſtates to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
But he, who would have us receave the weake in faith,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:15565:31"/>
whom God hath receaved, would not have us refuſe the fallowſhip
of Churches in that which is good, for any weaknes in them, of one
ſort or other. And this we have ſo plainly and plentifully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
unto us, both by the Prophets, yea by Chriſt himſelfe in
the Iewiſh Church; and Apostles, and Apostolicall men in the
first Christian Churches; In which many errours and evils of all
kindes were more then manifeſt: and the ſame ofttimes both ſo
farre ſpread, and deeply rooted, as the reforming of them was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be wiſhed then hoped for: as that no place is left for doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in that caſe by any, who deſire to follow their holy steps in faith
towards God, and charitie towards men, and effectuall deſire of
their owne edification.</p>
                  <p>What he here writes is ſurely true; for the Scriptures approve
not of rending away from true Churches for any corruption: I
uſe the word <hi>any,</hi> becauſe ſo long as we acknowledge the Church
to be true (whatſoever her ſinnes are) a ſeparation from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with it, is utterly unlawfull.</p>
                  <p>Our godly <hi>Prediceſſours</hi> had in them the zeale of God, and
love of his truth;<note n="*" place="margin">Two things I would know of theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they thinke not that the primitive Chriſtians were as zealous and ſincere as themſelves. 2. Whether they thinke not, that the Churches from vvhome they ſeparate, have as fevv, if not fevver corruptions, then ſuch Churches had, in vvhich the Apoſtles and other godly people dayly communicated.</note> But how ſhewed they it? Not by forſaking
their Brethren for offences, but in witneſſing againſt them, and
ſeeking their reformation. But now (ah that I could not ſay it)
ſome men know not how their zeale like <hi>Iehues</hi> may be ſeene of
men, unleſſe they make publick Schiſmes in Churches; and this
many times, not for any ſinne, that they can juſtly prove the
Church to be in, but upon diſcontentment, and becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have their way and will.</p>
                  <p>But of this no more now: For I purpoſe (if God ſpare my life)
to ſet forth a Treatiſe touching this very point.</p>

                     <hi>would have us</hi> conſider distinctly
of Religious actions, according to the ſeverall Rankes in which they

of them, a little after, he tels us thus:</hi> Some ſuch actions are
Religious only, as they are performed by Religious perſons. And of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:15565:32"/>
this ſort is Hearing (and ſo Reading) of Gods Word. The
Scriptures teach, and all confeſſe, that Hearing of the Word of God
goes before Faith, for Faith comes by Hearing, as by an outward
meanes. Hearing then beeing before Faith, and Faith before all
other acts of Religion inward or outward; it muſt needs follow,
that Hearing is not ſimply, or of it ſelfe a worke of Religion, and
ſo not of Religious Communion.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>For the word: the Greeke <hi>koinoneo,</hi> ſignifies to have a part,
or ſhare, in, or with perſons and things, anſwerable to it, is the
Hebrew <hi>Chabar,</hi> and imports a conſociation, copulation, or mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
together.</p>
                  <p>Againe, <hi>Communion</hi> is three-fould; The firſt between God and
Man; The ſecond between Man and Man; The third between
Man and actions; For the two later, the ſame is either <hi>civill,</hi> or
<hi>ſpirituall.</hi> I call that a <hi>civill Communion,</hi> when the matter or
ground of it is not in, &amp; of it ſelfe divine and ſpirituall, but earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and temporall: For <hi>ſpirituall Communion,</hi> this is practiſed
two wayes: 1. With perſons and things: 2. With things,
and not perſons. Where there is a foregoing joyning of people
together in a ſpirituall outward ſocietie, or body Pelitick, there is
a Religious Communion with perſons and things. But where this
is not, there is a Communion with things, as the State it ſelfe, and
the adminiſtrations done by the power thereof. Howbeit, as I
have ſaid elſe-where, they have no <hi>Church communion,</hi> that is, to
ſpeake properly, they have no Communion with the perſons, who
are not in <hi>Church-eſtate</hi> or union with them.</p>
                  <p>And that this is ſo, the Scriptures<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 18.</note> not only ſhew: but alſo the
deniall of it, leads unto groſſe abſurditie: For if a man communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
not, in, and with the Worſhip he doth, then it muſt follow,
that he neither helpes himſelfe in performing true Worſhipp un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, nor hurts himſelfe to doe the contrary; And ſo by this
ground, it is all one whether I doe the one or other. But of this
we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeake more hereafter; Now to his
<hi>diſtinctions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:15565:32"/>
1. <hi>It cannot be proved, that</hi> Hearing and ſo Reading of Gods
Word, are actions Religious only, as they are performed by Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
perſons.</p>
                  <p>This is not ſo: for it is not the perſon that makes the action
Religious; The reaſon is, if the action in it ſelfe be Religious, it
muſt then be reputed a Religious action, be the dore Religious
or not.</p>
                  <p>That no man may miſtake me, let it here be obſerved, that
actions are Religious, either in reſpect of the matter alone, or
the matter and manner too. I confeſſe, it by <hi>a Religious action,</hi>
we underſtand the later, that is, a thing well done for matter and
manner, in this ſence, none but <hi>Religious perſons can performe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if by a <hi>Religious action,</hi> we meane the thing it ſelfe, and as
<hi>(eo nomine)</hi> it is to be diſtinguiſhed, from what is, civill, naturall,
worldly; then I ſay againe, it is a Religious action (and of this ſort
is Hearing and ſo Reading of Gods Word) howbeit performed
by irreligious people.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Whereas he ſaith, that</hi> Faith goes before all other asts
of Religion inward or outward.</p>
                  <p>This alſo is untrue: For men wanting faith (witneſſe <hi>Kaan,
Ahab, Saul, Iudas)</hi> may yet performe <hi>acts of Religion.</hi> The
Scriptures here cited<note n="‡" place="margin">1 Timo. 1, 5.</note> are <hi>(extra organum)</hi> not to the point; For
they doe not ſay,<note place="margin">Rom. 10, 10.</note> that <hi>Faith goes before all acts of Religion;</hi> But
thus, without faith, we cannot pleaſe God by them. So then,
note the difference between the Scriptures, and what he inferreth
from them.<note place="margin">Gal. 2, 20.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Without faith all acts of Religion are without acceptation
with God; <hi>So theſe Scriptures;</hi> Ergo <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> faith goes before
all acts of Religion.</p>
                  <p>To his miſ-applying here, J may well apply that in the
<hi>Poet:</hi>
                     <q>Ego de alijs loquor,<note place="margin">Lucan:</note> tu respondere decepis.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Here is made true the ſaying in the Poet.<note n="a" place="margin">Fallacia alia aliam tradit.</note> 
                     <hi>One falſehood or

                     <note place="margin">Teren. in Andr.</note> His <hi>needs muſt follow,</hi> followes not,
but it is an unſound inference from a falſe principle. <hi>Hearing the

                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:15565:33"/>
viz. Religious and Spirituall; He reaſoneth <hi>a ſpecie ad genus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative:</hi>
becauſe Hearing in ſome caſes is ſo, therefore it is ſo
in all.</p>
                  <p>If it be his meaning, that Hearing is a <hi>naturall action,</hi> as it
reſpects the <hi>Organ</hi> or meanes, in, and by which a man receives
the knowledge of what he heares. Then it is true, according to
that rule in <hi>Philoſophie</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Relata eſse ſimul naturâ.</note>, <hi>Relations in nature are alike.</hi> But this

                  </p>
                  <p>He that eates and drinkes bread and wine at the Lords Table;
or ſpeakes to God in prayer; performes naturall actions, I meane
as the members of the bodie are here uſed: But if wee conſider
either the Sacrament or Prayer in the ſubject or object thereof,
ſo they are not <hi>naturall actions,</hi> but religious, and the like is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>For his two reaſons, they are of no weight; For 1. though <hi>the
light of nature teacheth a man to liſten to another,</hi> yet this proves
not, that it teacheth him to Heare in the way and manner here
pleaded for.</p>
                  <p>2. Were it granted it did: yet might the action be Religious;
For the <hi>light of nature</hi>

Word;</hi> Notwithſtanding it will not follow, when he heares in <hi>a
Church-way,</hi> that he performes no <hi>Religious action.</hi> This is as if

                  <p>This I ſay is right, but that which afterwards he makes one with

As if our <hi>Objection</hi> had no weaght; I will therefore lay the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

                  <p>Such Churches, unto whome God hath made no promiſe in his

                  <p>Therefore Gods people are not to goe unto falſe Churches.</p>

Ames layes it downe as a reaſon why <hi>a lawfull calling is
neceſſary; namely,</hi> that ſo they may exspect a bleſſing from
God.</p>
                  <p>It is true which theſe men ſay, for our ground for <hi>Hearing in

a divine inſtitution, an ordinance charged on vs, to practice, &amp; to
which God hath promiſed his preſence and bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>Let our <hi>oppoſites</hi> ſhew vs where it is writen, that the gyfts and

Wee never held it unlawfull, to heare any man deliver the Word

If another ſhould have framed ſuch an anſwer to him, he would
have ſaid, that either he had not learn'd his Sopheſtry, or elſe
thought he had to doe with fooles; For he reaſoneth, <hi>ab eo quod

of that which is true in part.</p>
                  <p>2. To ſay, <hi>if I approve of the Office ſimply, becauſe I heare
the Officer preach, then I much more approve of all the Doctrines
which he delivers.</hi> This is not ſo, nor ſo; For the <hi>Office</hi> is an
<hi>institution,</hi> by which the <hi>Officer</hi> hath power to adminiſter:
And howſoever, we have our freedome to like or diſlike of the
adminiſtrations, as we ſee juſt cauſe for it: Yet by our joyning
and communion with them, we certainly approue of the ſtate
it ſelfe, whether lawfull or unlawfull; For Example:</p>
                  <p>If I come where the Majeſtrates are ſitting, and have civill
juſtice there adminiſtred to me; Albeit by this going of mine to
their Court for judgement, I really approve of the ſtate that they
are in: yet J am not therefore neceſſitated to approue of all the
acts &amp; concluſions they make, but may diſlike them, if I ſee they
are not as they ought to be.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Corinthians,</hi> for ought I can ſee, reſorted unto <hi>the Feaſts
of idols,</hi> upon the ſame ground that the <hi>Treat.</hi> layes downe for
hearing. They went not of ſuperſtition; for they were to well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed;
and <hi>Paul</hi> in their perſon brings forth an excuſe for
them:<note n="*" place="margin">1. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>We know that an idol is nothing.</hi> As if they ſhould
ſay, we regard not what they have deviſed their publicke <hi>falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate</hi>
concernes us not, for we have left it: We are in no Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communion
with their Officers, our meaning is not to worſhip
as they doe, they intend one thing, we another. But did this ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Apoſtle? Not in the leaſt; For he knew their private diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
intention, was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a ſtrong fruit of the fleſh, monſtrous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpt
on, and a meere deluſion; For their <hi>eating</hi> was not to be

to that publicke ſtate where they were.</p>
                  <p>And here I deſire the Reader to note the difference betweene
<hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Treat. Paul</hi> makes the ſinne of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to be
their reſorting to an <hi>idol-ſtate;</hi> Not ſimply their eating (for tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they might have done elſe-where) but becauſe it was in, by, or

                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:15565:38"/>
The <hi>Treat.</hi> layes us downe a contrarie Doctrine, and tels
us, a <hi>falſe Church-state,</hi> is nothing: And Antichriſtian Officer
nothing; And that we may lawfully worſhip God in the one,
and heare his Word preached by the other, provided we be
not in Church-communion with the Officer, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Truely the difference here is great: For the <hi>Treat.</hi> cleares
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of the thing for which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> condemnes
them. But I will not preſſe this further now; Only what
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> * ſaid of the learned Fathers, I may ſpeake of the
<hi>Treatiſ. in stead of him, or rather above him, Paul the Apostle
commeth to my mind, to him I runne, to him I appeale, from all
ſorts of writers that thinke otherwiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For concluſion, if the falſe ſtate of a Church and Miniſterie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file

and doe as others doe, that practice Idolatry, yet not
approue of it. And ſo the three Nobles in Danial needed not to
have put themſelves upon ſuch pikes of daunger as they did, for
not falling downe as others did in the place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To this he anſwereth:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Treat:</note> 1. In preaching of the truths of the

                  <p>

may procure one that: But wee are no ſuch children as to give the
cauſe ſo away.</p>
                  <p>1. Therefore J ſay, <hi>in preaching of the truths of the Goſpell</hi> (viz:
by a falſe Miniſter, about which is our diſpute) <hi>an idolatrous act is
performed;</hi> And that the <hi>Reader</hi> may underſtand this thing the
better: He is to conſider, that divine worſhip is not to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by a particular thing (howbeit in it ſelfe good) but as all
the eſſentiall parts belonging thereto (whether they are perſons
or things) are kept and obſerved.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> in Baptiſme uſeth water, and in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the Lords Supper, gives bread, and otherwhile wine
too; doth this cleare their adminiſtrations of idolatry? So runns
the <hi>Treat:</hi> reaſoning: But wee cannot receive it, for the Lord
never ſpake ſo by him.</p>
                  <p>J thinke all men doe thinke, that <hi>Vzziah</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">2 Chro. 26. 16.</note> committed an ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
act, when he invaded the Prieſts Office. But what made it
ſo? Tooke he unlawfull <hi>incenſe?</hi> No. Uſed he <hi>ſtrange fire?</hi>
No. Offered he prohibited ſacrifice, or upon a wrong <hi>Altar?</hi> No.
Where then lay the fault? The Scripture tels us <hi>it pertained not
to him to burne incenſe unto the Lord, but to the Sonnes of Aaron</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Ver. 18.</note>
To apply this, if his <hi>act were idolatrous,</hi> becauſe he wanted a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
howbeit obſerved many truths of the Law; By the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
the <hi>Church-acts of Antichriſtian Miniſters, are idolatrous;</hi> Yea
&amp; as for <hi>the truths which they preach,</hi> this clears their <hi>acts</hi> no more

from idolatry; then <hi>Vzziahs</hi> true incenſe and Altar, quitted him

                  </p>
                  <p>3. <hi>If in preaching the truth</hi> (according to the point in queſtion)
<hi>no idolatrous act is performed:</hi> Then it will follow, that a man

                  <p>3. To ſpeake a little further in this thing, (becauſe ſome of
our Oppoſites conceive it is much for them:) I deſire theſe few
particulars may be conſidered: 1. The Ceremonies whereof
we ſpeake, had a neceſſarie uſe of avoyding ſcandall<note n="q" place="margin">Act. 15, 28.</note> 2. They
were expedient for drawing of people unto the faith &amp; order of

it hath no other ground but mans invention, it is a ſpeciall part of
divine worſhip, in it ſelfe a practice ſinfull and unlawfull, and
makes the obſervers like idolaters in their idolatrous actions.</p>
                  <p>That which next followes, is his <hi>Wodden Reaſon</hi> of a Croſſe. I
will ſert downe his owne words.</p>
                  <p>To come neerer home,<note place="margin">Treat:</note> it is the cuſtome in Popiſh Countries,
that all that paſſe by a Croſſe, muſt in honour of it leave it on the

or going.<note n="t" place="margin">D. Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Hart. c: 1, diviſ: 2, pag: 46</note> Now, if I ride with others that way, I may doe the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was a common practice (as a wiſe and learned man
obſerves) among young Students, in the time of the <hi>Dunſes,</hi> that
if in diſputation they were brought to an inconvenience, were it
never ſo abſurd: they would have a diſtinction, though without
braine or ſence.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſay, that the <hi>Trea. diſtinction</hi> here is ſenceleſſe, but
this I ſay (and will make it good) it is truthleſſe, beſides hurtfull
and dangerous.</p>
                  <p>For to take the things as he layes it downe; that is, there are two
wayes to paſſe by a Croſſe, and I know there are in company
ſome, who in honour of the idol, will leave it on the right hand;
Now in this caſe, if I ſhould ſilently paſſe on that ſide with them,
I ſhould offend, yea though I did it, for no other cauſe, but to
keepe on with my company.</p>
                  <p>My reaſons for it are theſe: 1. The practiſing of an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent

is an occaſion of confirming and hardning of them in their

                  <p>The Aſſumption is as manifeſt; For 1. by the Scriptures<note n="a" place="margin">Deu. 12. 30. Levit, 18. 3. Exo. 23. 24. Levit. 9, 27. 28. Deu. 14. 1 Levit. 19. 17. Gen. 35. 2. 3. Eſa, 27. 9.</note> wee
are prohibited from all conformitie with idolaters in any of their

It was the cuſtome<note n="b" place="margin">Herodot. in Thalia: Becan. in analog. vet. &amp; nov. Teſt. c. 15.</note> of the <hi>Arabians</hi> and other Heathens, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

                  <p>This alſo may be further proved by the teſtimonie of learned
men; For to have any thing common with idolaters, or to ſerve
God after any way of theirs; Or to take up, and make uſe of
any of their rites, orders, obſervations, inſtitutions for to worſhipp
God in, or by them: they hold to be unlawfull. Yea howbeit a

And here I deſire the Reader to obſerve, that were the grounds
true which he layes downe for hearing: to wit, <hi>that there is no
Religious Communion betweene the perſons preaching and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
They cannot be chalenged to approve of the Miniſters ſtate or
ſtanding: They have no communion with the office of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,</hi>
&amp;c. I ſay, were theſe things ſo, (which are not) yet would this
practice be found ſinfull; becauſe (as we have before ſhewed)
herein men worſhipp God in, or by a way and meanes, which
idolaters have inſtituted.</p>
                  <p>Our ſecond argument is taken from the <hi>Treat.</hi> words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
which are theſe:<note place="margin">Treat.</note>

thus:</p>
                  <p>He that heares the Ministers of the Bb. ſending, and of the
Pariſhes ſent too: hee heares (in the ſence of the Scriptures) falſe
Prophets: But it is not lawfull to heare falſe Prophets:</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is not lawfull to heare the Ministers of the Bb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
or of the Pariſhes ſent too.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is proved clearely in the defence of our 12. <hi>Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
The <hi>Minor</hi> is certaine by theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p>1. The hearing of <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> is forbidden in the Word of

he flyes away from the poynt, and ſpeakes nothing either for it, or

                  <p>Whoſoever lusteth after aspirituall harlot, committeth with her

ſo: Ergo, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The later part of the argument, which is onely doubtfull, is
proved by opening and applying the ſimilitude thus. As they
commit carnall whoredome, who haue fellowſhip with harlots
in any degree; kinde, or Practice of their whoredomes: ſo in
this cauſe, it muſt needs be ſpirituall adultery, to heare the word
in the way and manner we deſpute of: becauſe it is to haue a fel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lowſhip
or ſociety with the great <hi>whoorantichrist:</hi> I ſay it is to go

whoredomes. And what I here lay down, is laid downe
by the beſt learned in all ages, viz. that we muſt go out from ido<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>laters,
as not to be behoulding to them, for any of their rites, or
ders, inſtitutions: neither ſerve the Lord in, or by any helpes,
meanes, furtherances of their ſinfull devices, for to do otherwiſe,
is to commit ſpirituall adultery with them: ſo write <hi>Aguſtine</hi>

                  <p>The truth here, is never the worſe nor leſſe, howſoever he

                  <p>Now, if that in this way, make a Lawfull Communion; then

not the <hi>state of their Office</hi> at all, but onlie imports a licence
that ſome have from their Prelate, to doe certaine ſervices ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie

is here by anie way limited or circumſcribed, but is, (as

Land: Hence then, everie hearer muſt needs be the object of
ſuch a Miniſterie, and ſo communicateth therewith, if there be
any weight of reaſon in the <hi>Treat.</hi> words. And here we have

                  <p>But ſeeing we have the weapon now in our owne hands, wee

                  <p>Therefore it is a ſinne to doe it.</p>
                  <p>The Propoſition is proved from 1. <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 5. 22. and here
granted by the <hi>Treat.</hi> The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is as certaine by
theſe reaſons following.</p>
                  <p>For 1. This going to the place where they goe, and hearing as
they doe, is an occaſion whereby a man comes into a ſuſpition of
idolatrie, and that he is of the ſame mind with the reſt, whatſoever
otherwiſe he pretendeth; And thus have our Martyrs teſtified, as

                  <p>2. It is an appearance of evill, when men doe that, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth

But that they have ſome ſineſter ends, both in comming to

                  <p>3. When idolaters ſee us preſent at their worſhip; they

taught by a man of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> that becauſe they might not
take the Tables away, wherein a Law was engraven; He ſhould
therefore turne them up-ſide downe, which was as good as to take
them away altogether. Howſoever, the <hi>Treat:</hi> takes not from
us the Tables of holie Scriptures, wherein is written the <hi>Law</hi> of

downe: Which is as good as to take them quite away. J
know what J ſpeake, and will ſtand to it; For if this place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10,
14, 15. reſpects not a true outward calling, but is to be underſtood
promiſcuouſly of all Miniſters, be their calling never ſo falſe, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
Antichriſtian. I ſay, if this Text be ſo to be interpreted, then
have not the Miniſters of God any more to ſay for the juſtification
of their ſtanding, then the <hi>Miniſters of Satan</hi> (I uſe Pauls phraſe<note n="*" place="margin">2. Cor. 11. 15.</note>)

of his bleſſing on their labours and Ministerie, who are ſaid, Rom.
10. 15. to be ſent; But unlawfull Miniſters have no ſuch promiſe of
Gods preſence with them, nor of his bleſsing on their labour and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie.
Therefore by ſending Rom. 10. the Apoſtle intendeth not
unlawfull Miniſters.</p>

Only this I ſay, whoſeoever heares in a falſe Church, cannot by any

on that which he doth; The reaſon is, becauſe a true conſtitution
of a Church, that is, where men are gathered together, according
to the Goſpell of Chriſt, is that only Lawfull Religious ſocietie, or
Communlon of Saints, wherein God wilbe honoured, whereby he
wilbe ſerved, and whereto he hath promiſed his preſence and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance;

                     </gap> in <hi>Greeke,</hi> hath the ſignification * of breaking
a <hi>Rule, Order,</hi> or inſtitution. In Hebrew it is named <hi>Miceſol</hi> of
<hi>halting,</hi> or cauſing another to tripp or fall by ſomething caſt in
his way. The Chaldee <hi>Takul,</hi> and Sireak <hi>Cheſhela,</hi> is of the like
derivation.</p>
                  <p>In the Arabian tongne the word is <hi>Shuch</hi> ſo named of unſetling
another. In propriety of ſpeach, it ſignifies the crooked peece in a
trap, to which the bayt is tyed; at which a <hi>Mouſe, Rat, Wolfe,</hi> or any
other vermine biting, the trapp falls down &amp; catcheth the beaſt.</p>
                  <p>According to <hi>Tertullian, a ſcandall</hi> is Example of a thing not
good, but evill, leading or emboldening unto ſinne. Or thus it may
