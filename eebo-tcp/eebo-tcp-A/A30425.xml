            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Psalm cxviii. <hi>v.</hi> 23.</bibl>
               <q>It is the Lord's doing, and it is marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous in our Eyes.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>Things do sometimes speak, and Times call aloud; and as all Men are before-hand with me, in the choice of this Text, at least in applying it to the present time, so that amasing Concurrence of Providences, which have conspired to hatch and bring forth, and perfect this extraordinary Revolution, would lead one very naturally to use these words, even tho we had no such Verse in Scripture; for we have before us a Work, that seems to our selves a Dream, and that will appear to Posterity a Fiction: a Work about which Providence has watched in so peculiar a manner, that a Mind must be far gone into Atheism, that can resist so full a Conviction as this offers us in favour of that Truth. And if a thread of happy steps of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64569:5"/>
the one hand, and of mistaken ones on the other, can upon any occasion be made an Argument, we have it here in its utmost force.</p>
            <p>It is the <hi>Lord's doing,</hi> not as the Heavens and the Earth, as the Revolutions of Day and Night, and the whole Chain of Second Causes are his Work: The whole Springs of Nature are wound up by him, so that all things are in some sort his doing: He gives also a secret Direction to all second Causes to accomplish his Eternal Purposes. He knows all the foldings of our Hearts, and the composition of our Natures so well, that without putting us under a force, he can bring about what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever pleases him. He also on some great occasions does Violence to Nature, and puts her out of her Channel in those extraordinary Productions that are called Miracles. But besides all these, there are times in which the great Governour of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth will convince the World, that he is not an unconcerned Spectator of Human Affairs: But because Men are apt to be so partial to themselves, and to their own Opinions, as to look on every favourable Accident as a Smile from Heaven, and that Sanguine People are as ready on the one hand to think themselves God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64569:5"/>
and the special Objects of his Care, as Melancholy Men on the other, in the sourness of thought that oppresses them, construe every thing that succeeds not according to their Wishes, as the effect of some cross Aspect on them; it is necessary to find the true Temper between flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering our selves too much, and the charging our selves too severely; and to examine Providence by such equal and just measures, that we may neither put too much on the common course of Second Causes, nor ascribe too much to such Specialties as our Partialities may incline us to imagine appear in our favours: for because we are always kind to our selves, we are very apt to believe that Heaven is so too. But to come closer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All signal and eminent things are by the common Phrase of Scripture ascribed to God; and therefore every Event that is great in its self, and may become yet much greater in its Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ought to be imputed to an immediated Hand of Heaven: some that have judged that a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Direction of all things was too great a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction to his Divine Being, and a trouble un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of it, have yet thought that its care ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64569:6"/>
to great matters. If then this may be laid down for a Rule, we must conclude that this Transaction now before us, is God<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s doing, since the vast importance of it is so visible, that it may be perhaps lessened rather than aggravated, if one would attempt to set it forth. You all know what you both felt and feared: The over-turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Church, and the subverting of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, must in consequence have brought on the Ruine both of the Protestant Religion and the publick Liberty all <hi>Europe</hi> over. When all this is stopp'd, and a happy Crisis appears, that gives us the fairest hopes not only of the securing our Religion, together with our other Temporal Concerns, but of putting a check to the Spirit of Persecution, which has of late raged so fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously against our Brethren in so many different places of <hi>Europe,</hi> and that the Persecutor of Religion, and the Ravisher of Liberty, and the Scourge of the Age, after his having been so long a Plague to all his Neighbours, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be brought to feel a little of those Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which he has laid on others; so great a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action as this, which is perhaps the fore-runner of a greater, may upon very just grounds be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64569:6"/>
called the <hi>Lord's doing,</hi> if every thing that is great is so.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Those Things in which God's Honour is most particularly concerned, may be well rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned his <hi>doing</hi>; for if he has a Providence that extends it self to all Things, we have much more Reason to conclude, that Mankind has a more special Title to it: And among Men, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are under a particular distinction; and of all Christians, that those who have reduced Christianity to its Primitive Purity and Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, are its chief care; so that the reestablish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Glorious Work, which God in a series of many signal Providences had set up in the last Age, and which for the Sins and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed Practices of those who pretended to it, was brought so low in this, may be justly ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to that Sovereign Wisdom that governs the Church, which was purchased by <hi>the Blood of the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Matters of Controversy are not proper upon this Occasion; but without entring far into them, the common sense of Mankind, and the general Notices of Truth that are impressed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Minds, may serve to determine the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64569:7"/>
part of the Differences between us and our Persecutors. Whether Men ought to satisfy themselves in the Points of Religion, or ought to take them upon trust? Whether Men ought to put the stress of their Religion upon a real Renovation of Heart and Life? or, if it may do full as well, to hire and pay a Priest for forgiving our Sins in this Life, or redeeming us from the punishment of them in the next? Whether we ought to believe our Senses and Reason in their proper Objects, or not? And not to run out too far, Whether those Eternal Rules of Justice and Mercy, ought to be the Measures of our Actions, or if Zeal for Holy Church, can warrant us to break our Faith, and destroy our Neighbours? All these seem to be so plain, that one would think the Decision should be soon made; and indeed, if instead of that false shew of Learning, and the many hard words with which these Matters have been disguised and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, Men would try them in a shorter and simpler Method, Truth would be sooner found out. In a word; The Truth of our Religion appearing to us in so many conspicuous Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, especially after the noble and worthy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64569:7"/>
Endeavours of so many of the Lights of this Church, who have proposed all the Points in dispute to the World with Advantages beyond any thing that had appeared ever since the first beginnings of those Contests. After all this, I say, we must conclude, that this <hi>is the Lord's doing</hi>; since a Work that is so dear to him, seems now to be again received into his protection, in so signal a manner, after he had seemed to hide himself from it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Those Providences which seem immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to work upon the Minds of Men, and to engage them into the Designs of Heaven, are in a more conspicuous manner the <hi>Work of God.</hi> For the Mind of Man being a free Agent, it is less accountable how vast Multitudes should come all under the same Impressions, unless God did by those secret and undiscernable Methods of his Wisdom, give them such directions. This <hi>Psalm</hi> seems to be penned upon the making up of that Breach that was between the House of <hi>David</hi> and the House of <hi>Saul</hi>; all <hi>Israel</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the latter, while only the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to the former, see 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. But all were afterwards united in owning of <hi>David,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:64569:8"/>
who was become the <hi>Head Stone of the Corner,</hi> that joined those two great Divisions in one. <hi>David</hi> had felt how little either <hi>Princes</hi> or <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> that is, those of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi>; or to speak in an English Phrase, the <hi>Peers</hi> or <hi>Commons</hi> of the Jews, were to be depended upon: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>vers.</hi> 9, and 10. he says, <hi>It is better to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in Man: It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> either numerous Armies, or wise Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils. The Reign of <hi>Saul,</hi> and the Charms that were in <hi>Jonathan,</hi> had, no doubt, given the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily a great Root. But the Divine Designa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was upon <hi>David,</hi> had broke through all that, and had turned the Hearts of the whole Nation as one Man to him. <hi>David</hi> had seen a formidable opposition in his way, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had passed through great and threatning Dangers; but the <hi>right Hand of the Lord</hi> had been of his side, and had done <hi>valiantly.</hi> And all the Force that was brought against him, had vanished into nothing; or as a <hi>Fire of Thorns,</hi> it had blazed and crackled a little, but was soon spent: And therefore as there was an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal rejoicing in the <hi>Tabernacle of the Righteous,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:64569:8"/>
so <hi>David</hi> went into the House. of God, this Psalm being set as the Hymn of his Triumph: which was probably sung before him as he went into the Tabernacle in Mount <hi>Zion</hi>; for these words, <hi>Open to me the gates of Righteousness, I will go into them and praise the Lord,</hi> together with the answer, <hi>This is the gate of the Lord into which the Righteous shall enter,</hi> seem to be set for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in at the Gates: In a word, the centring of the whole People in him, was so particularly a work of Providence, that in a most especial manner <hi>this was the Lords doing.</hi> And therefore an extraordinary concurrence of all favourable Accidents, and particularly, the disposing of all Mens minds one way, has a Character upon it, that must force us to say, <hi>This is the Lords doing.</hi> I know how dangerous and deceitful an Argument this form Providence will ever seem to be; and therefore I will touch it with that caution which is requisite. It is certain, that God for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Nations, gives sometimes such a torrent of Success to those who are the Instruments of their Correction, that this may be rather a mark of his displeasure against those who are to be brought low, than of his favouring those who
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64569:9"/>
are lifted up. There are also such Mysteries in the whole Conduct of the World, that though our Partiality makes us apt to Magnifie all that we like, yet if we carry it too far, we will be in danger to be often out of countenance, when the same Argument turns against us; therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can make any Comments on so doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Text, we must be first sure that the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work is well laid, and that both the Cause it self, and the means used to advance it, are good. But when we are got over that, and are satisfied both in the one and the other, then we can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbear to look on a chain of unlookt for and unaccountable Providences, without a most sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Joy. I will not build too much on the Characters that have appeared in the Insensible part of the Creation, I mean the Winds and Weather, for one does not know how far those have been the effects of the natural series of things, yet one cross Wind which seemed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd only to make us apprehend the hand of Heaven, without suffering much by it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out losing above one Man in it; and another strong and prosperons Gale, which both preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us from those who were appointed to wait
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64569:9"/>
for us, and brought us so near our Port, but changed immediately for another to fetch us into it; and which having executed its Commission, was immediately in another corner, and the soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Weather, in a Season so far advanc'd, are things so remarkable, that we are extream insensible if they make not deep Impressions on us. But, as I said before, the application of Providence in the turning and bending the minds of Men, is yet a most immediate work of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The precipitation and folly of our Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors in opening their ill designs so early, the Impudent breach of Faith, and the unrelenting Cruelty that they had put in practice in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Kingdom, sent us over many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Witnesses, to awaken us, and to let us see what we ought to look for whensoever that bloody Religion should come to prevail among us; and of what account all Promises and Laws were to be, whensoever they could break through them. This coming so critically, in the very time in which the Repeal of Laws was to be asked in their favours, was a more sensible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against it, than all the specious ones could ever be that were brought for it; and so
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64569:10"/>
much Evidence was necessary, otherwise the good Nature of some, and the weakness and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, had perhaps put us to a more Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and Troublesom after game; but such an apparent breach of Faith, and so furious a Persecution as they had raised beyond Sea, were Arguments that every Man could comprehend and manage, and out of which it was not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to beat them. I need not enlarge on all that chain of Errors and Violences that have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, since the first broaching of the Design; they were too many to be all repeated, and too visible and well known to need that it should be done. Nor would I willingly say any thing that might look either like Insulting or Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, God has seemed to have given them up to such a Spirit of delusion, as if the Curse of those who Worship graven Images, had fallen on them; <hi>Like unto them are all they that worship them</hi>: and in Conclusion God put such a Cup of <hi>trembling and astonishment in their hands,,</hi> that he seemed to have taken away <hi>the heart of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors,</hi> and that according to another of <hi>Davids</hi> Expressions, <hi>none of the men of might have found their ands</hi>; in short, the methods that God has suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64569:10"/>
them to take for the alarming and awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the whole Nation, for the uniting of all that were so unhappily broken asunder before, and for ingaging all to center in what is now brought about, is an Eminent Character of a hand of God in the whole matter: Why went they so fast and so barefac'd? Why grasp'd they at so much all at once? Why was the Hook so ill covered when the Bait was thrown out? Why was it that few were either so weak or so corrupt, but they have been so successful that they at last have set them right? In a word, all this blasting of Counsels, and defeating of their designs by their own means, was of God, and must be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be his doing.</p>
            <p>The Errors also of the great Supporter of Persecution, his Quarrels with the Head of that Mystical <hi>Babylon,</hi> and his diverting his Force to a new War, an unjust one, to be sure, since begun by him; the Concurrence of so many Great Princes, and above all, that happy Union that was in those Blessed Provinces, that tho' com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of so many different Bodies, seem'd to have but one Head and one Heart upon this Occasion, are all conspicuous Characters. The
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64569:11"/>
Constitution and the Interests of the States do always biass them against War, or every thing that may interrupt their Trade; and the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which appeared from a War in their Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, seemed at least to engage them to secure themselves rather by a strengthning than a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing of their Force; and yet the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal and chearful Concurrence of all among them, from the Highest to the Lowest, both those that were in the Government, and those that were without doors, by which they put their whole Strength to this Design, and put all to hazard to carry it on, sparing neither their Fleets, their Armies, nor their Treasure; all this, I say, made every one conclude, that this was the Finger of God. The Concurrence of all in this Nation, and especially of that Great Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from which the chief Opposition was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, was no less signal. Their Numbers, and that Courage which is so natural to this noble Nation, and many other Considerations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to give just Apprehensions of a Bloody Scene. But how strangely did all this vanish? And how have our Hopes and even our Wishes been so far prevented, that we are scarce yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64569:11"/>
out of that surprize of Wonder into which this threw us? When all this is laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we are tempted not only to cry out, that this is the <hi>Lord<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s doing,</hi> but that it is such a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his as is beyond any thing that is in all the Records of past Times; and is a Scene all of Wonders, but Wonders of Love and Mercy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When Revolutions happen, that carry so many Characters of the Attributes of God on them, that we see both Power, Wisdom, and Goodness in every step of them, then we are yet more particularly bound to adore the Hand of God in them. The Progress that <hi>Mihomet</hi> and his Followers made, which is indeed one of the most amazing things in History, carried evident Marks of the Power and Justice of God, in suffering that Scourge of the Eastern Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to bring them under his cruel Yoke. The Progress of the <hi>Roman</hi> State had in it Characters both of the Power and Wisdom of God, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposing the World for the Christian Religion, by bringing it under one Empire, and such a Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized Government as was a due Preparation for so holy and so perfect a Religion. But here we have both Power, Wisdom, and Goodness,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64569:12"/>
all concurring to set forth the Glory of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it. So great an Undertaking, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Branches of it, all meeting so happily to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and favoured with so many prosperous Accidents, shew how the Power of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in it. The Depth, the Secrecy, the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Management and Execution of it, shew the Wisdom of God; but above all, the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and unbloody Issue to which it was so unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly brought, is a Character of God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to us, which can never be sufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged: If either a slow Lingering had made us languish, or a bloody Decision had been the Price of the Victory, we should have had reason to confess, that our Sins had rendred us unworthy of so great a Mercy as we have now before us: But with how much admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must we look on and see our selves prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with so early a Deliverance? and that our Deliverer, as he came detesting the Imputation of Conquest that was cast on him, so he was received in a way suitable to his own good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. And thus upon all these Reasons, as we see in general what are the Characters from which we may conclude what things may be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64569:12"/>
called the <hi>Lord's doing,</hi> so we see in particular how fitly they all belong to that which is the Subject of our wonder at present.</p>
            <p>For this <hi>is marvellous in our eyes.</hi> We talk of it, both to our selves, and to one another in this style: who can cease wondring, especially those who have seen how the springs of this Affair have moved all along? We wonder at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance it self, and we ought to wonder much more how such a Guilty Nation as this is, should have been delivered in so harmless a manner. We see what a storm has gone over, and broke out upon many of the Foreign Churches. A Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in all its Circumstances far beyond the blackest of any that are in History. If our Church has advantages in her Constitution, that make her the just pride and glory of the whole Protestant Side; we have still so much the more to answer for, if we have not walked worthy of those Blessings, that Light, and those Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages with which God had honoured us. And why is it then that God has only shaken the Rod over us, but has not suffered it to hurt us? Our Enemies had rage enough to design it, and they had an abused Authority so entirely in their hands, that they seemed to have got the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64569:13"/>
under as implicit obedience, as they have got over the Faith of their Votaries. How comes it then that God did not suffer this to go farther, that he did not punish our sins, and in particular and sharpness with which we had trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one another, by delivering us up to those whose tender mercies are cruel? All this is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous, but whether it is so in our eyes or not, I do not know: that is, whether we make those Reflections on it, which such miracles of mercy call for from us; or if we let it pass by us without any other Reflection but that of talking about it, as we do concerning all other Revolutions. In a word, as this is the <hi>Lord's doing,</hi> and <hi>marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> in it self, so it ought to be so <hi>in our eyes</hi>; for it is certainly so in the eyes of all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. We ought to make such pauses in thinking on it, as may lead us up to adore and admire the great Author of it, in this his doing.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> We ought in a most profound prostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to magnify the goodness of God to us in it: to him belongs the Glory of it, for his hand has wrought this Salvation for us. Some may mention their Chariots, and some their Horses, but we ought only to mention the name of the Lord our God. It will not at all derogate from
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64569:13"/>
the Honour of our Great Deliverer, to consider him as the Instrument, whom God has so highly exalted, in bringing about so great a work by his means, and so to direct our Homage and Adoration to the Original of this and all our other Blessings. And God has imployed an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument in<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it, who desires that the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments may be wholly made to that Eternal Purpose, that brings about all its Designs in so Sovereign a manner. This is indeed in all its parts above the skill and wisdom of Man: and therefore let us offer up the whole honour of it to God: and when that is done, this will lead us best of all to pay all the due returns of gratitude and esteem to Him whom God has now blessed for the second time with the greatest honour that can fall on a mortal Man, that he seems born to be the great Blessing of the Age. His first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the World carried with it a Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to those happy Provinces; for happy they were, from the time that they came under His protection. We that saw their Peace and Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Order and Justice that reign'd among them, and the sense that they have of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct that procures it, saw an earnest of those Blessings that seem to be before us. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64569:14"/>
the passion that they all expressed at His leaving them, was to us the truest Indication of the joy and confidence with which we ought to receive Him here, and of the hopes that we may promise our selves under so glorious a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Let us therefore ponder all these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of God so as to admire them, not only in a lazy and silent wonder, but in those true acts of Praise and Adoration, by which <hi>our souls, and all that is within us, may be stirred up to bless the Lord, and not to forget any one of all those benefits which he has bestowed on us, upon this occasion, in which he has redeemed our life from destruction, and crowned us with his loving-kindness and tender mercies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> If this Work of God does possess us with that veneration which is due to it, we ought not to stop the course of it, till it has had its full ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; nor to daub matters by slight and palliating remedies. We see now before us the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious beginning of a noble Change of the whole face of Affairs, both with relation to Religion, and the Peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> that we could have wisht for. It is so far beyond our hopes, that we durst scarce let our wishes go so far: we may, if we are not wanting to our selves, and to the Conjuncture before us, hope to see that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64569:14"/>
which may be according to the Prophetick style, termed <hi>a new Heavens, and a new Earth.</hi> But if a Spirit of jealousy and murmuring, of impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and faction, and of returning back to that out of which God has so signally extricated us, grows up; so that instead of reaping the fruits that we have now in prospect, we have not Souls big enough, nor Hearts good enough, to carry this on to perfection, then we may justly fear our being delivered up to all those Evils from which we will not be healed. But if on the other hand we raise our minds above every nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowness of thought, and all partial regards, and consider matters with such a naked impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality as becomes Christians, Protestants and Englishmen, and provide such Remedies as are requisite, then we may hope to see this blessed morning to grow up to a perfect day. In a word, <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death</hi> are before us, and <hi>blessing</hi> and <hi>cursing.</hi> Those who chuse <hi>life,</hi> and every thing that leads to it, secure a <hi>blessing</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and entail it on their Posterity: but if we chuse <hi>death</hi> rather than <hi>life,</hi> there is no help for it: such persons secure a curse to themselves, and do what in them lies to entail it on their Posterity; and there is scarce any indication
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64569:15"/>
more certain of the Sins of a Nation being grown up to that height, that it must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, than the Miscarriage of so great a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance as God has wrought for us, which will be an eternal Blot on the Wisdom of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; since, in that Case the Figure of our Saviour must be justly applied to us, <hi>We have piped to you, but you have not danced</hi>; or these other words of his, <hi>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thee under my wings, as the hen gathereth her brood, but thou wouldest not</hi>: Or that of the Prophet, That while <hi>Children were in the Womb, there was not strength to bring forth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> But if we will carry on, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this marvellous Work of God, we must study to be such, that God may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent him of the good which he seems to have prepared for us. While we are under such a happy Influence of Heaven, we must not raise up such an Interposition between it and us, as may not only make us lose this happy oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, but turn it to a Curse by the ill use we may make of it. We have not forgot the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Excesses of the year Sixty, and how that great Revolution that seemed to promise all that a Nation that had been so long tossed with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64569:15"/>
wars and changes of Government, could wish for, was so unsuccessful; but instead of the Nations receiving that with those Acknowledgments that were due for such a Blessing, how did all People, as it were, conspire to defeat the ends of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in it? The excesses of Rioting and Drunkenness, and the Disorders of all sorts, grew not only to be practiced, but gloried in, as if those Abominations had been the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per distinctions of a Loyal man; a Virtuous man looked out of Countenance, if he could not go in to the madness of the time; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the high Professions of Religion in the former times, had been a disguise to many ill Designs, men not only laid aside all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies of Religion, but began to think it a piece of breeding to decry it as an Imposture. This went so far, that perhaps in no Nation, under Heaven, did Men treat the Religion which they professed, so familiary as we did; and those who were not concerned any further in Religion than as it might advance their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Designs, were willing to encourage this Spirit of Atheism, hoping that it would make way for a Religion which in some respects is worse than no Religion at all; for tho, with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64569:16"/>
relation to particular Men, there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison indeed to be made between Popery and Atheism; yet, with Relation to humane Society, a Religion that dissolves Faith and good Nature, and gives Authority both to Persidy and Cruelty, is worse than none at all. As we reflect upon these Abominations, and on the fatal Consequences of them, which have been on us so long; so in order to the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the return of the like Evils, we must a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the relapsing into the like Sins. It is neither the Union nor Wisdom of Councils, nor the Strength of Fleets or Armies, that will secure us from the Judgments of God, which we may expect will fall upon us with an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry redoubling, according to the Prophetick Phrase of seven times heavier than any thing that we have yet seen or known; <hi>if those that are filthy, will be filthy still</hi>: If the Atheist will think that his standing up for the Prorestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is a warrant to him to laugh at all that is Sacred; In a word, if Men think that their Fears are over; and that, therefore they may give themselves up to work wickedness with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out restraint; then we may justly expect a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the like, if not of greater Miseries. We
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64569:16"/>
despised our Religion, and God has threatned to take it from us; yet it seems the Prayers of the Few have prevailed over the cry of the sins of the Many. But we have no reason to expect that it should be always so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We are certainly the happiest Nation in the World, if we can but know and value it as we ought to do. Our Climate, though none of the best, yet is Kind and Fruitful: and if the Sun is less favourable to us; yet our Situation as it separates us from all the World, so it lets the Wealth of the whole World in upon us, and keeps Danger and War at a distance from us: We have all the Liberties of Freemen tempered with a firm and steady Government. But which is above all, we are blest with that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religion which the Son of God revealed to the World, and we are Reformed from those Corruptions which had defiled it, and that in so equal a manner, that we are the chief Object of the Roman Fury, as well as the just Glory of the Reformation: We have had the truths of Religion both in the points of Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Practice opened to us with such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, that if we stumble or lose our way in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64569:17"/>
the midst of so much light, we have more to answer for than any Nation under Heaven: and to Crown all, God has put us so far into the hands of our Enemies, as to let us clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see what we were to expect from them. They had devoured us in their hopes, and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be as <hi>Haman</hi>'s Friends casting Lots, and watching a fit opportunity to destroy us, when of a sudden the Snare was broken, and we have escaped out of it. I hope none of those that were here will soon or easily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get how near they were to be swallowed up: and if they had then grave thoughts and serious purposes, I hope this change in their Fortunes will not make them dismiss, or forget them. And for us that saw God's Wonders in the Deep, and that after we had past an Eminent Danger, languished so many daies in the Harbour between Hope and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair, upon which we seemed to put on firm resolutions, and make solemn Vows of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Can we be guilty of so hainous an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and breach of Faith, as to forget the engagements, into which we then entred, of a serious and universal Reformation?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:64569:17"/>4. But while we let our thoughts out to wonder at the Wisdom and Goodness of God, let the admiration of these produce somewhat like them in our selves: we ought to grow wise; for our Experience has cost us dear, and had almost proved a very dreadful School to us: we now see the folly of trusting to that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and of imagining that any weight was to be laid on all the Promises that could be made us by them. It is not to be doubted but that many were so little acquainted with the depths of Satan that are in that Black Society, as to believe it was possible for them to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truth, Honour and Good nature, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the points of Speculation that are in their Schools: we resolved to make the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, and they have taken such pains to let us see our mistake, that it is to be hoped we will never at any time hereafter relapse into the like Error. The goodness of God, that appears now in such endearing Characters to us, ought likewise to form the like temper in us. Our minds have been too much em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered on all hands, by reason of some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable differences which our Enemies
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64569:18"/>
have always managed, with so much address, as to engage us to weaken our common Force, by dividing our selves into Parties: and by a fatal series of woful Accidents, these sparks have been blown up into such a flame, that they had almost quite consumed us. But it is to be hoped that we will study to be all of one mind; or, if we cannot arrive at so great a blessing, that at least we will love one another, and remember that we are Brethren, fellow Christians and fellow Protestants, that must have been destroyed together, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must now support and bear with one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. But as I doubt not but the happy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of all peoples minds will now produce a desired temper in those matters; so we must not bound our Charity within so narrow a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass: No, we are Christians, and therefore we must not only love our Brethren, but even our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies and our Persecutors, and so overcome their evil with good. For how hard thoughts soever we may justly have of the Spirit and Councils that govern that Church; yet many among them in the simplicity of their heart, and according to the impliciteness of their Principles follow
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64569:18"/>
those Opinions that have been dropt into them from their Childhood; they have not strength of thought to look narrowly into them, nor do their Rules allow them in so bold a thing as to examine whether they are in the right or not: and though it is hard to imagine how any should go over to them; yet it is easie to imagine how those who are among them should be shut up blindfold and muffled up with the awful bonds of Authority and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility. And for such, though we are under the highest provocations that any Nation can have; yet after all, let us still remember that we are Christians, and that as we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared openly against the Injustice and Cruelty of our Enemies, we govern our selves by the Rule of doing as we would be done by. It is a presage of Moderation in our whole proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that even the less governable Part of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I mean the unruly Multitude, has been so happily restrained from extravagant act of fury: for without justifying what they have done, we may well rejoyce for what they have not done, and that Bloody and Outragious Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices have not been made. It is the peculiar
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64569:19"/>
Character and Glory of this Nation, That Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness and Compassion are so natural to it, that the Unfortunate are always pitied by them. And if tumultuous Numbers have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served so much temper in their wrath, how much more is to be expected from Councils that are to be governed by Justice and Mercy, and under the directions of a Prince who has shewed that his hatred of Persecution in others, was not only because his own side suffered in it; but from a steady and uniform Principle which has made him not only just to those of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but even kind too, whensoever they deserved it. We, indeed, ought to study the firm securing of our Religion, even from the remotest possibilities of hurt that can come to it from that restless and violent spirit which has hitherto created us so much trouble; this we owe to Almighty God, to this Glorious Church, to our Selves and to our Posterity: but in doing this we must so govern our selves, as not to suffer our Blood to boil too high, nor our Thoughts to run too fast; and while we consider what we may perhaps owe our Enemies, we ought to take care not to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64569:19"/>
forget what we owe our Selves, that so we may look to the honour, as well as the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Holy Religion. In a word, let us resolve to be Christians indeed, and to act as Men that have those undefiled Rules, and that bright Example, which our Saviour has given us, ever in our Eyes, and then it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for us to miscarry. But if Revenge and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosity prevail over the softer and wiser Councils, that Reason and Religion may suggest, and if in all that we do, we take not care to have God ever on our sides, it will be easie for him to blast all Councils, and to defeat even the greatest and best-laid Designs. We have now before our Eyes, one of the signallest Instances that is in any History, of the Instability of all human things: on which one cannot reflect without making a full stop in his thoughts. But the subject is so speaking, that it needs not be insisted on, and there are particular Circumstances in it that forbid it: but if it is not decent to speak much of it, yet I hope none are so insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as not to think much of it. Perhaps some may imagine that we are safe, because we cannot be dashed on the same Rock about
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64569:20"/>
which we see so great a Shipwrack; but, alas, if we provoke God to hide his Face, and to withdraw his Protection from us, his ways are past finding out, he can bring ruine and destruction on us from that hand from which we perhaps apprehend it the least: If Prosperity and Success blow any up, and make them forget God and all the Vows that they made to him, he will never want means and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to make them return to themselves, and to remember him.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter then, since God has wrought so extraordinary a deliverance for us, let us adore him, who is the true Author of it; and under him let us pay all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns possible of Respect and Gratitude to that Blessed Instrument on whom he has laid so much Glory. Let us improve it to the highest and noblest ends that can be thought on; let us live under it as becomes those who take care to do nothing that may render them unworthy of the continuance of it: and let us all, in our several Stations, study to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our selves so, That the Glory as well as the Safety of the Nation, and the lustre as
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64569:20"/>
well as the establishment of our Religion, may be raised up to that pitch, that the Name of an <hi>Englishman</hi> and a Protestant may have a sound all the World over, that may give Terror as well as create Esteem; and that this Work, which is now brought to so great a forwardness, may in due time attain to its full perfection; and that then we may all have reason to break forth in the Triumphant words with which this <hi>Psalm</hi> begins; <hi>O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, because his mercy endureth for ever. Let Israel now say, That his mercy endureth for ever. Let the house of Aaron now say, That his mercy endureth for ever: and let them that fear the Lord say, That his mercy endureth for ever.</hi>
