            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>My</hi> LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAD I thought that this Piece I here Dedicate to Your Lordship, was not above Your, or any Man's, Patronage, I had shewn less Respects to You in making You so Mean a Present. Were You Monarch of the Universe, TRUTH (which it Defends) could receive <hi>no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi> from Your <hi>Grandeur.</hi> Her <hi>Genius</hi> is so Sublime, and Her self so Nobly-born, that, like Him from whom she descends, she is <hi>Beneficial</hi> to <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>Incapable</hi> of receiving <hi>Advantage</hi> from <hi>any.</hi> All Extrinsecal Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, in stead of <hi>Honouring</hi> her, <hi>Debase</hi> her. Her Well-compacted and Indissoluble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick is altogether <hi>Divine:</hi> Contrary to our Material Structures, it is <hi>Built from the Top;</hi> and, its Foundation laid as high as <hi>Heaven it self.</hi> The GOD of <hi>Truth</hi> has imprinted all <hi>Natural</hi> Truths in <hi>Created Beings,</hi> as in the Footsteps of his Infinite Wisdom; from whence, by the Vehicles of our Senses,
<pb facs="tcp:95549:3"/>
they are Copy'd and Transcrib'd into our Mind; where, without our Labour, they beget all our <hi>Natural Notions;</hi> and, as Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and even Experience, assures us, they do also, at the same time, give us some Knowledge of the <hi>Things themselves;</hi> which steadily and distinctly Reflected on, breed in us that best Natural Perfection of our Understanding, <hi>SCIENCE;</hi> of which those Notions are, as it were, the <hi>Seeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was Mankind put into a plain Road-way of gaining <hi>Clear Intellectual Light,</hi> by the Common Providence of our Good Creatour. To <hi>improve</hi> in which, and to keep our Thoughts from wandring into <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> the same Goodness of our Maker en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed us with a Faculty of Reflecting on the Operations of our own Minds; and, on all the Guilded Train of our Spiritual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and of the several Natures and Manners of them; by which means those who were addicted to <hi>Attentive Reflexion,</hi> or <hi>Speculation,</hi> invented a Way, and setled Artificial Rules, how to <hi>manage</hi> their <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Judgments</hi> and <hi>Discourses.</hi> Which Rules laid orderly together, and found by Reason to be Agreeable to the Natures of Things according to the Being they had <hi>in the Mind,</hi> and, therefore, <hi>Solid;</hi> did, in time, compose that excellent and most useful <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> call'd <hi>LOGICK.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:3"/>
But, my Lord, the Crooked Byass of Men's <hi>Wills</hi> perverted their <hi>Reason,</hi> and made them disregard this Well-grounded and <hi>Regular Method,</hi> given them so freely by the Author of Nature. The Heathen Philosophers of old, whose God was Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, affected to set up several <hi>Sects,</hi> to pride themselves with the Empty Honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing esteemed their <hi>Heads.</hi> The Christian Schools succeeded; who, at first, discours'd gravely on those Subjects which were of a higher Nature; but, whether the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances did not bend their Thoughts <hi>that</hi> way, or from what <hi>other</hi> Reason, they set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled no Scientifical Method to attain Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical Knowledges. Yet, those who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Principles, (as the great <hi>Aquinas</hi> constantly endeavoured) did gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally discourse even in <hi>such</hi> Subjects, when they had occasion, very <hi>solidly.</hi> But, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when School-disputes grew to be the only fashionable Learning, the Multitudes of Combatants increas'd, and the Contests were maintain'd by several Great Bodies; each of which thought it Creditable to their Party to set up and follow some Eminent Man of their own. Hence this Nature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taught Method came to be much neglected; and he was thought to win the Prize who was the subtilest and acutest <hi>Disputant,</hi> and not he who could most solidly <hi>Demonstrate</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:4"/>
               <hi>Truth.</hi> Hence, no Exact and Rational Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick being settled and agreed on, they were apt to take up oftentimes Wrong Principles; and the several <hi>Conceptions</hi> of our Mind were mistaken to be so many several <hi>Things. Demonstration</hi> was rather <hi>talk'd</hi> of for Form's sake, than <hi>pursu'd</hi> and <hi>practis'd;</hi> and, the the Use of <hi>General Maxims,</hi> which should establish our Discourses, was scarce once thought on; without which, Demonstration was Impossible. New Questions in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, of little or no use, were started; and bandy'd to and fro by Terms and Words not well understood; nor their Sense agreed on, by the Contending Parties. The Heat of Opposition fix'd Men in their own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Innumerable Quaint and Nice, and sometimes Impertinent, Distinctions were invented, to escape their being Entangled by the Arguments of their Adversary. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man affected to be a <hi>Proteus,</hi> and took more Care to <hi>elude</hi> Opposition, than to <hi>set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> and establish <hi>Truth</hi> on Immovable <hi>Grounds.</hi> The true Sense of <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Doctrine, not being taken from himself or his First Interpreters, but from some Modern Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanders, was lost; and his Text drawn into several Meanings, to abet Contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tenets. In a Word, nothing was <hi>deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively concl<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ed,</hi> nor likely to be so, by this way of School-Term-Learning, as things
<pb facs="tcp:95549:4"/>
were manag'd by <hi>Unmethodiz'd Disputation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus stood the Affair of Philosophy at the beginning of this present Century; which having been fertile of many Excellent Wits, two of the Chiefest of them, <hi>Cartesius</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and our Ingenious Countryman Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> having taken Scandal at these Miscarriages, and an Aversion against that Miracle of Nature, <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whose Doctrine Schoolmen had ill represented; and being withal Men of <hi>Strong Brains,</hi> enabling them to carry their Conceptions through, and to make them Coherent; they did, out of their Zeal for Truth, undertake to set up New Systems of <hi>Philosophy;</hi> tho' <hi>Cartesius</hi> in some sort, <hi>furbish'd</hi> up, <hi>improv'd,</hi> and <hi>refin'd</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the old Corpuscularian Way of <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus;</hi> which I have fully confuted in the Appendix to my <hi>Method;</hi> and, I hope, beyond all possibility of Reply. But, these two Gentlemen, being better vers'd in the Mathematicks than in Metaphysicks; and, thence, not apprehending how Corporeal Natures could <hi>get into</hi> the Mind, or <hi>be there;</hi> nor, reflecting that a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Nature, being incomparably <hi>Superiour</hi> in the Rank of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> to that of <hi>Corporeal</hi> Things, must, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, have naturally and ncessarily a Power to <hi>comprehend,</hi> after its manner, (or by way of Knowledge) that <hi>Inferiour</hi> one; they were forc'd, thro' their want of Higher
<pb facs="tcp:95549:5"/>
Principles, to build all Knowledge, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Things themselves</hi> in their Knowing Power, but upon <hi>Ideas</hi> or <hi>Similitudes</hi> of them; tho' neither of them set themselves to make out or demonstrate how we could possibly have our <hi>Notions,</hi> or <hi>First Notices</hi> of the Things by them. Now, these Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Ideas</hi> being, most evidently, neither the <hi>Things known,</hi> nor any <hi>Mode</hi> or <hi>Accident</hi> of those Objects; and, consequently, <hi>nothing at all</hi> of the Thing in <hi>any</hi> sort, were manifestly convinced not to be the Productions of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Wisdom, in which he had imprinted all <hi>Natural Truths,</hi> but <hi>meer Fancies,</hi> coin'd by their Imagination. These <hi>Ideas</hi> or <hi>Fancies</hi> then, and only these, they contemplated, and Grounded all Natural Truths, (which could have no Foundation but only in the <hi>Things</hi> which the First Truth had made) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these <hi>Fantastick Resemblances:</hi> and, thence, they put all Formal Truths to consist in the <hi>Agreement</hi> of those Empty <hi>Similitudes;</hi> till at length (as Fancy let loose to fly at its full Random, and driven forward with a quick Wit, does naturally and genuinly lead) they had introduced a kind of Fanaticism into Philosophy; built, in the main, or in great part, on a pretended <hi>Inward Light</hi> by means of those Imaginary and Visionary <hi>Ideas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Introversion upon these unsolid <hi>Aiery</hi> Bubbles, and thence their neglecting
<pb facs="tcp:95549:5"/>
the <hi>Things</hi> themselves, and our <hi>Solid Natural Notions,</hi> Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> was brought to Confound <hi>Corporeal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Natures; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, (these two being the Adequate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of all Philosophy) all Philosophical Knowledge was rendred impossible. And <hi>Cartesius</hi> left us no means to know whether Man is <hi>One Thing</hi> made up of Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or <hi>Two Things,</hi> tack'd together by virtue of some <hi>Accident;</hi> which well consisted with their <hi>Substantial Distinction.</hi> Hence also it came, that GOD was brought in at every Hard Pinch, to act contrary to what the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Things requir'd; without which, they could not <hi>lay</hi> their <hi>Principles,</hi> or make their Scheme <hi>cohere;</hi> that is, they would needs make GOD, as he is the Author and Orderer of <hi>Nature,</hi> to work either <hi>Preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally</hi> or else <hi>Supernaturally;</hi> which is a plain Contradiction. Nay, Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> finding no <hi>Fancy</hi> in his Imaginative Power that suits with our Notion of <hi>[Thing,]</hi> would perswade the World that no Man living knows what a <hi>Thing</hi> or <hi>Substance</hi> is; that is, that none knows what the Word <hi>Thing</hi> means; which is so Evident to our Natural Thoughts, that it is impossible for the rudest Person in the World to be Ignorant of it. In a Word, their Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy so inveigled their Reason, that they came to deny <hi>Self-evident Truths;</hi> and held many other Propositions, which were absolutely <hi>Impossible</hi> and <hi>Contradictory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:6"/>
Wherefore, seeing Philosophy reduced to this lamentable Condition; and, that <hi>Solid Rationality,</hi> and all <hi>Truth</hi> in <hi>Natural</hi> Objects, were thus in imminent Danger to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run and born down by Imaginary <hi>Conceits;</hi> and apprehending that GOD's Providence had fitted and enabled me to redress such great Mischiefs; I thought it became me to re-instate <hi>Reason</hi> in her <hi>Soveraignty</hi> over <hi>Fancy;</hi> and, to assert to her the <hi>Rightful</hi> Dominion Nature had given her over all our <hi>Judgments</hi> and <hi>Discourses.</hi> I resolved therefore to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intricate Truth, (which lay too <hi>deep</hi> for <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial</hi> Fancy to fathom) from all those La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinths of Errour. I observ'd that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy labour'd and languish'd under many <hi>Complicated Distempers,</hi> (all springing from this way of <hi>Ideas)</hi> and that they were grown Epidemical; nor could they be cur'd by the Application of Remedies to <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Part,</hi> or by confuting <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Particular Errour.

            <p>I know, my Lord, <hi>Reformation</hi> made by a Single Man, tho' but in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> seldom gains Credit to him who attempts it. And, it must be confess'd, that, to pretend to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> where there is <hi>no Necessity,</hi> has an Ill Name; and is justly held to spring from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, Interest, Pride, or some such other Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister Motive. But I am very confident, that whoever peruses this Treatise, nay, but even the <hi>Preface,</hi> will see, that the Occasion of this Undertaking was not only <hi>Expedient,</hi> but <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</hi> Nor can any Man justly tax him of Arrogance, or of Usurping a Dictature over other Men's Judgments, tho' he opposes Great Multitudes of Speculaters, who offers <hi>his Reasons</hi> to convince <hi>theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>this</hi> Necessity, now laid open, of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Philosophy, I shall add <hi>another,</hi> of a much more weighty Concern; and which may also rectifie some zealons well-meaning Friends; who, judging of Things by their own Short Reach, think that the Advancing Truth in Philosophy is little better than <hi>Time and Labour lost;</hi> whereas, I, on the Contrary, do really think, that the Supplying what the World most wants, is the Greatest, and most Universal Good I can possibly do. This other Necessity then, of my rectifying our Modern Philosophy, (which will make others see,
<pb facs="tcp:95549:7"/>
how great a Good it is,) is <hi>this:</hi> Those Truths which are of a higher, and more Sacred Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can never be <hi>rightly Explicated,</hi> nor consequently (such Men not valuing Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) be <hi>duly recommended</hi> to those who Dissent from them, unless <hi>True</hi> Principles of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy be <hi>Settled,</hi> and <hi>Unsound</hi> ones <hi>Confuted.</hi> For, since no <hi>Explication</hi> of Faith can be made by <hi>Faith it self; all</hi> of them must necessarily be made by our <hi>Reason,</hi> shewing the Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity they have to our <hi>Natural Notions,</hi> or to such Knowledges as we had from the Things in Nature; especially, since Dissenters draw their Chief Objections from the Repugnancy of those Points to our Natural Principles. 'Tis a known Truth, that as every <hi>Definition</hi> must be the <hi>Self-same Notion</hi> with what is <hi>defin'd,</hi> so must every right <hi>Explication</hi> too; it being, in reality, nothing but the <hi>Unfolding</hi> what was before <hi>wrapt up Closer.</hi> Whence follows, that, when he who has the ill Luck to have taken up <hi>False Principles,</hi> comes to explicate the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or any High Point of Reveal'd Faith; his <hi>Explication</hi> must always be <hi>Contrary</hi> to True Principles of <hi>Nature,</hi> and perhaps may have twenty real Contradictions in it; and, so, Common Reason (as was said) telling all Sensible Men, that the <hi>Explication</hi> must be the <hi>same Sense</hi> with the Point which it <hi>Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates;</hi> the Tenet of Faith will <hi>suffer</hi> in the
<pb facs="tcp:95549:7"/>
Opinion of Witty Men, by such an Untoward and Senseless Explication; be <hi>Ridiculous</hi> to Adversaries; and be held perfect <hi>Nonsense</hi> and <hi>Contradiction.</hi> Whereas, if the Philosophy, by which those Tenets are Explicated, be <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Solid;</hi> then, since both <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Reveal'd Truths</hi> are <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>same Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> (the GOD and <hi>Author of All Truth,)</hi> who cannot contradict Himself, and therefore those two Sorts of Truths <hi>cannot but agree;</hi> it will follow, that the Explication of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Points, made according to True Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, must needs appear to Intelligent Men to be <hi>most Rational;</hi> and <hi>most Consonant,</hi> and not Contradictory, to True <hi>Natural Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:</hi> Which will <hi>Comfort</hi> Faith in those who believe already; <hi>Recommend</hi> it to all Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Indifferent Seekers; help to <hi>Convert</hi> to Christianity those, whose Reason was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Dissatisfy'd upon such Sinister Miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits; and, Lastly, <hi>Confound</hi> Adversaries, by putting them past Opposing it by any Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of True Philosophy, and leave nothing for them to object against it, but <hi>Idle</hi> and <hi>Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Fancies,</hi> whose weak Attempts are easily defeated. Whence, I could heartily wish, that, <hi>were True Philosophy in Fashion,</hi> all Sects (so the State thought fit) might have Free Liberty to Print the <hi>best</hi> Reasons they can muster up against Christianity; Resting confident, that <hi>(in that Happy State of Science,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:8"/>
               <hi>or True Learning)</hi> nothing in the World could gain to Truth a greater Advantage. Till that Desirable Time comes, all I can do, is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare here publickly, that I shall take it for a great Favour, if any Learned <hi>Socinian, Deist,</hi> or <hi>Atheist,</hi> would please to send me those Reasons they, or their Leaders, judge of <hi>most Weight,</hi> why they cannot embrace the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> or <hi>Christianity;</hi> which they may do privately, and Unnam'd, to the Stationer who publishes this Treatise; and I do hereby promise them, I will give their Objections their Full Force, and publish an Answer to them: Onely, I will expect, that their Arguments shall be <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> ones, or drawn from the <hi>Opposition</hi> such <hi>Reveal'd</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, as they mislike, are conceiv'd by them to have to some <hi>Principles</hi> of Logick, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks, or Metaphysicks, which are either <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident,</hi> or which they will undertake to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to Evidence:</hi> These onely being such Objections as becomes a Christian <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> to speak to. For, if they be <hi>Extrinsecal</hi> ones, and built on <hi>Histories,</hi> or on <hi>Groundless Fancies;</hi> or, if they consist in Glossing <hi>Words,</hi> in whose <hi>Sense</hi> we are not <hi>Agreed;</hi> it belongs to a <hi>Critick,</hi> or a <hi>Historian,</hi> and is not the Proper Employment of a <hi>Philosopher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not be thought, by what is said lately, to cast any Reflexions on <hi>Cartesius</hi> or Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> (whom I join here equally, and
<pb facs="tcp:95549:8"/>
indifferently,) as intending any Diskindness to Christianity by their New Methods of Philosophy: It appears both by their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and by their particular manner of handling their Subjects, that they meant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously and sincerely to follow what they conceiv'd to be <hi>True.</hi> Onely I must say of both of them, that, if their <hi>Way</hi> of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phizing, and, therefore, their Philosophy <hi>it self,</hi> be shewn to be far from <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Solid;</hi> then, in case any Chief Christian Tenet should come to be Explicated by <hi>their Ways,</hi> those Sacred Points <hi>themselves</hi> must necessarily, for the Reason now given, receive some Taint and Blemish by such <hi>Ill-grounded Explications:</hi> And the same, for the same Reason, I must say of <hi>School-Philosophy</hi> too, if it proceeds upon Principles that are not <hi>Well-grounded,</hi> or <hi>Solid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains, my Lord, to give my Reasons why this Common Duty I here perform to the Learned Part of Mankind who are Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates of <hi>Science,</hi> comes to be <hi>particularly</hi> address'd to Your Self: Which, in short, are these. I was much <hi>in Debt;</hi> and it was an Honest Man's Part to endeavour to <hi>discharge it.</hi> I ow'd much to Your Lordship's Father, of Honourable and Pious Memory, who both encourag'd my first Endeavours, and favour'd me with a particular Friendship and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence to His Dying-Day: And, I make account, such kind Obligements, writ in a
<pb facs="tcp:95549:9"/>
               <hi>Grateful Heart,</hi> ought to be as <hi>Lasting,</hi> and as <hi>Binding,</hi> as those Obligations drawn on <hi>Paper;</hi> and, withal, ought to devolve, by a Hereditary Right, to His Immediate Descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Your Self. I ow'd very much to Your Lordship's own Person, for the Kind Respect with which You have been pleas'd to honour me. I ow'd much to all Your Lordship's Nearest and Noblest Relations, both in the <hi>Direct,</hi> and in all the <hi>Collateral</hi> Lines. And, lastly, since every Man who writes for <hi>Truth,</hi> naturally loves to be <hi>Understood,</hi> I ow'd it to my Self, to present this Treatise particularly to Your Lordship; than whom, I know none of our <hi>English</hi> Nobility more <hi>Acutely Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</hi> It is of such a Nature, by its laying the Foundation of Philosophy from the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Bottom-Principles, that, to comprehend and penetrate it thorowly, there was requir'd a Judgment both <hi>Solid,</hi> and <hi>Pointed;</hi> both which Perfections meet in Your Lordship's Great <hi>Genius,</hi> in a <hi>High Perfection.</hi>

            <head>THE PREFACE, DIRECTED To those Learned Men of both our Universities who have a Due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for TRUTH, and a Sincere Desire of KNOWLEDGE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>AFter I had Publish'd my</hi> METHOD to SCIENCE, <hi>which I Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your selves, I came to receive certain Information that very many</hi> Students <hi>in both the Universities, and not a few of those also who were to</hi> instruct others, <hi>did apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the</hi> Way <hi>of</hi> Ideas, <hi>in hopes to arrive by that means at Philosophical Knowledge. My best Judgment, grounded on very Evident Reasons, assur'd me, that that Method was far from</hi> Solid, <hi>and utterly Unable to give you the True Knowledge of</hi> any thing <hi>in Nature; being it self altogether</hi> Groundless, <hi>and meerly</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial. <hi>I saw clearly, that to addict your Thoughts to study</hi> Similitudes <hi>and</hi> Resemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb facs="tcp:95549:10"/>
               <hi>(which, as will be most evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, could not possibly give you any True or Certain Light to know the</hi> Things themselves,) <hi>was no better than (as it is in the Fable)</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treum vas lambere, pultem non attingere. <hi>It struck me with a very sensible Trouble, that the precious Time and Pains of such great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Men, who were the</hi> Flower <hi>of our</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>who were hereafter to be</hi> Guides <hi>to</hi> others, <hi>and whose very</hi> Profession, <hi>and State of Life, had addicted them wholly to the Pursuit of</hi> Knowledge, <hi>should be imbued with such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as render'd the Attainment of it abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely Impossible. I look'd upon my self as one who, having spent near half a Century in Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Studies, was capable to avert and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress so great a Harm; and, thence, I esteem'd my self bound in Duty to make you aware of the Way you have either</hi> chosen, <hi>or</hi> light <hi>into</hi> for want of a better; <hi>that you might consider se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously whether you ought not to retrieve your Steps ere you had wander'd too far in a Path which could never bring you to the End you aim'd at. This Consideration oblig'd me to</hi> strike at the Root, <hi>and to overthrow the whole Way of proceeding upon</hi> Ideas, <hi>by whomsoever advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and to</hi> demonstrate <hi>by many Clear, and, I hope, Unanswerable Arguments, and Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Instances, that it was</hi> Superficial, Fruitless, Insignificant, <hi>and meerly</hi> Phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:10"/>
2. <hi>When I had near finish'd my</hi> METHOD, <hi>I gave a Cursory Look over Mr.</hi> Locke's Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say concerning Humane Understanding; <hi>and I hap'd to light on some places, which gave me a high Esteem for it; insomuch that I began to conceive some Hopes that his Ingenious Thoughts might, with some few Alterations, be reconcil'd to</hi> True Philosophy: <hi>For, I was at that time far from intending to make any</hi> Reflexions <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, but highly extoll'd it where-ever I came: judging of the</hi> Whole, <hi>by the</hi> Scantlings <hi>I had seen of it (as it were) accidentally. But, the last</hi> September, <hi>setting my self to take a nearer and fuller View of the</hi> whole <hi>Book, I quite lost the Hopes, I had gladly entertain'd formerly, of According it with Philosophical Principles; and became much concern'd, that so Excellent a Wit should be half lost to the Commonwealth of Learning, by lighting unfortunately into such an Unaccountable Method. For, I saw evidently, that (besides the Oddness of the Way he took) his</hi> Fancy, <hi>the Vivacity of which was very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, had, in very many Particulars, got such an Ascendent over his</hi> Reason, <hi>that, as he was</hi> Sceptical <hi>in divers Things which were</hi> Clearest Truths; <hi>so he seem'd in very many</hi> others <hi>to be</hi> Positive, <hi>the Contrary to which was</hi> plainly Demonstrable, <hi>and in a manner</hi> Self-evident. <hi>I was heartily sorry, I say, to see so considerable a Writer, whose Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Genius, and Clear Expression, would have</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:11"/>
               <hi>made Truth Irresistible, had he taken her part, mis-led so strangely as to take</hi> Fancies <hi>for</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; <hi>and to think that</hi> Philosophy, <hi>which is</hi> the Knowledge <hi>of</hi> Things, <hi>consisted in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Contemplation of</hi> Empty Ideas, <hi>or</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This wrought up my Thoughts higher, and made me conceive a greater Indignation against this New Way of Philosophizing; and that, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particularly, for</hi> his <hi>sake; tho' I saw the</hi> Cartesians <hi>as much wanted Rectifying in their Grounds, as he, or rather more. Wherefore, to gain such a powerful Assistant over to Truth's side, (of which, his Sincere Professions of Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity would not let me despair,) I resolv'd to lay open those</hi> Blemishes <hi>of Errours I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in his</hi> Essay, <hi>retaining still a due Esteem for the many</hi> Beauties <hi>it contain'd: For, I do assure him, my Nature leads me, as willingly to acknowledge and give their just</hi> Elogiums <hi>to his</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>as to discover the</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>he may have fallen into at unawares, as I doubt not but my Readers will see; and, that (tho' I declare Open War against the</hi> Way <hi>it self) I rather incline to</hi> Excuse, <hi>than to</hi> Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate <hi>his Faults or Mistakes. Indeed, the Duty I ow'd to Truth oblig'd me to note those Latter with such a Distinction, as I conceiv'd they did more or less injure that Sacred Concern. And, I was the more willing to enter the Lists against such a Champion; because, if I hop'd to</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:11"/>
               <hi>gain any Advantage over him, (I had rather say, if I had the good Fortune to</hi> win <hi>him,) 'tis impossible Truth should ever obtain a more clear Victory; For, no Man, who takes the just Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Mr.</hi> Locke<hi>'s Great Wit, can think, that any thing but the Invincible Force of</hi> Truth <hi>can soil him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>I have good Reason to fear, that this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring against whole Bodies of</hi> Ideists, <hi>at once, will be interpreted by some to savour of Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity: It will be deem'd by others, a high Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence to make such a Bold Breach with a</hi> World <hi>of Acute Speculaters; with</hi> whole Sects <hi>of Modern Philosophers, both in two Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nations, and in our own Universities; and, in many Things, with most of the</hi> School-men <hi>too. Others will think, that I do very unwisely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Opposition; and, by such a brisk Attack, in a manner</hi> Challenge <hi>all those Great Men who are of a contrary Sentiment. But, what is all this to his purpose, who has devoted himself wholly to</hi> promote <hi>and</hi> defend TRUTH; <hi>and, is sure he does, upon Solid Reasons, judge that to be</hi> True <hi>which he maintains? This Objection seems grounded on this False Maxim, which some Men have set up very politickly, to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish their own Reputation with the Vulgar, as Sacred and Inviolable;</hi> viz. <hi>that</hi> [The Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of a Multitude has the Force of a kind of Authority, to bridle the Understandings of Private Men from Setting up a Contrary
<pb facs="tcp:95549:12"/>
Doctrine.] <hi>Now, whatever some Men may think of this Position, I must declare my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, that it is the most pernicious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim that could be invented, to</hi> hinder <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of Rational Nature in that which should most</hi> perfect <hi>it; that it puts a stop to the farther</hi> Use <hi>of their</hi> Reason <hi>in all future Mankind; that it makes all</hi> Improvement <hi>in Knowledge</hi> Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, <hi>and utterly obstructs the Advancement of</hi> SCIENCE. <hi>No</hi> Reasoners, <hi>how</hi> many, <hi>or of how</hi> Great Name <hi>soever they be, have any</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>at all but by Virtue of the</hi> Reasons <hi>they produce; whence, that</hi> Single <hi>Man, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be, that brings</hi> better Reasons, <hi>for the Tenet he advances, than all the former World has done for theirs, ought to have more of this</hi> (miscall'd) <hi>Authority, than that</hi> whole World <hi>of Opposers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>But, this postponing the Consideration of the Multitude of Dissenting Speculaters to Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Reason, is ten times more Justifiable, in case that Opposing Party does not so much as</hi> pretend <hi>to, much less</hi> produce <hi>Self-evident Principles, nor Demonstration, to</hi> Ground, <hi>or</hi> Conclude <hi>their Tenets; but builds on</hi> Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Suppositions, <hi>and makes use of Wit, good Language, and other meerly plausible Ways, to recommend their Conclusions to the Approbation of their Readers. Those who do not so much as</hi> pretend <hi>to Demonstration and Clear Principles, being unable to offer</hi> any Thing <hi>that is</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<pb facs="tcp:95549:12"/>
               <hi>ought not (in my Opinion) meddle at all with</hi> Philosophy; <hi>nor appear before Learned Men with an Expectation their Doctrine should be</hi> Embraced; <hi>nor can they, in reason,</hi> Assert <hi>any thing, but only</hi> Propose.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>But the main Consideration which takes off all Invidiousness from my Carriage in this Particular, is, that in this whole Contest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the</hi> Ideists <hi>and me, there is Nothing at all that is</hi> Personal. <hi>'Tis not the</hi> Parts <hi>or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of the Contenders, but their</hi> METHOD <hi>which is in Dispute. The Slowest and Lamest Traveller, who can but</hi> creep <hi>forward in a</hi> right Path, <hi>shall sooner arrive at his Journey's End, than Another whose Legs are</hi> nimble, <hi>and his Pace</hi> swift, <hi>if he takes a</hi> wrong Way <hi>at his</hi> first <hi>setting out. Rather his</hi> greater <hi>Strength and Agility do, in such a ease, enable him only to run</hi> more widely astray; <hi>as the strongest Bow shoots</hi> farthest <hi>from the Mark, if the Shast be</hi> wrong levell'd. <hi>Let the Talent of Wit in the</hi> Ideists <hi>be Incomparable, (as doubtless that of</hi> Cartesius <hi>was, to whom I may, with Justice, join Mr.</hi> Locke) <hi>if the</hi> Methods <hi>they take be not proper to attain</hi> true Science, <hi>their</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, <hi>when they mistake, (as I am sure they do in their Principles, and, consequently, in most of their Conclusions) must be to the same Degree more</hi> Enormous, <hi>as their</hi> Fancies <hi>are more</hi> Ingenious. <hi>'Tis their</hi> METHOD <hi>then, or their</hi> Way <hi>of Proceeding and Building</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:13"/>
               <hi>upon</hi> Ideas, <hi>which I most blame and oppose. Or rather I deplore the Detriment accruing hence to the Learned Part of the World, that Men, endowed with such an Excellent</hi> Genius, <hi>did unluckily light into such an Indirect and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd Path; seeing what vast Advances</hi> Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>might have made, had such Men taken up Right Principles, hit upon the Right Way at first, and apply'd their Strong Brains to pursue it. 'Tis not then their</hi> Endowments <hi>which come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Competition, to which I deferr as much as is possible: For, I much more admire the Skill of such Architects as can build a Castle</hi> in the Air, <hi>and make it hang there by</hi> Geometry <hi>(as it were) than all those common sort of Artists, who can raise such a Structure upon</hi> Firm Ground.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>What our several Methods are, the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of my Book tells my Reader in short,</hi> viz. <hi>that, (as I have hinted in my Dedicatory)</hi> Theirs <hi>is to ground all their Discourses on</hi> Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as; <hi>that is, (as themselves express it, and as the Word</hi> [Idea] <hi>declares,) on</hi> Similitudes <hi>or</hi> Resemblances; <hi>which</hi> Similitudes, <hi>(as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly demonstrated in my three first Preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries,) are meer</hi> Fancies: <hi>Mine is to build them solely and entirely on the</hi> Things <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in which, as the Footsteps or Effects of his Essential Verity, the Creative Wisdom of the</hi> God <hi>of</hi> Truth, <hi>has planted and imprinted all Created Truths whatever. This Method I observe so exactly throughout my whole</hi> ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THOD,

               <hi>and this present Treatise, that I disown and renounce any Discourse in either of these Books, which is not built either upon the</hi> Things <hi>as they</hi> are in Nature, <hi>or according to the Being they Naturally have</hi> in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: <hi>And, I shall owe much to that Man, who will show me that I do any where decline from this solid and well-grounded</hi> Method. <hi>As for</hi> Formal Truths, <hi>found in our Judgments or Discourses, I build them on most Evident Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or strive to reduce them</hi> thither; <hi>and on the</hi> Connexion of the Terms <hi>found in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, by which only Truth can be express'd; keeping still an Attentive Regard to the</hi> Things <hi>themselves. And I desire that the Differences between the</hi> Ideists <hi>and me may be decided by the Impartial Umpirage of Rigorous Logick. A</hi> Test, <hi>which, as I am sure their Cause cannot bear, so I am confident they will never accept of or stand to. For, it may easily be discern'd by any serious Reflecter, that their Procedure and manner of Discoursing is not by way of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principles, and drawing a Close and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knit Train of Consequences, as I do in all the main Points of my</hi> Method, <hi>and in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Treatise on occasion; but, by</hi> Unproved Suppositions, <hi>and</hi> Loose Discourses <hi>made up of well-express'd Wit, Ingenious Remarks, Quaint Novelties, Plausible Explications, and such other</hi> Superficial <hi>ways; which, tho' they take with Vulgar Readers, are (to speak plainly)</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:14"/>
               <hi>more fit for</hi> Flashy <hi>Rhetorical</hi> Declamation, <hi>than for</hi> Manly <hi>and</hi> Solid PHILOSOPHY. <hi>Nor do I think it did ever so much as once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the</hi> Thoughts <hi>of the</hi> Ideists, <hi>much less their</hi> Hope, <hi>that their Discourse could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to</hi> Self-evidence, <hi>or to that Artificial Form of</hi> Close <hi>Discourse call'd a</hi> Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Syllogism; <hi>which is the</hi> Touchstone <hi>to distinguish what Ratiocinations are truly</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive, <hi>what</hi> Inconclusive <hi>or Fallacious.

            <p n="8">8. <hi>I am very well aware what Prejudice I bring upon my self, by Addressing you in this Confident manner at the very first Dash of my Pen; and some well-meaning Friends have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertis'd me, that this Carriage of mine has been reflected on, especially by some meer School-men; who, tho' they in reality</hi> know nothing, <hi>are more proud of their</hi> Probabilities, <hi>than the most</hi> Scientifical <hi>Man living is of his</hi> Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations; <hi>tho' their utmost Performances amount to no more than that of the ridiculous Fortune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellers of old,</hi>

               <hi>Whence I do fully expect, that the Humour of our Modern Speculaters will judge this Assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mine to be a high Presumption of my own Performances; nay, some will think it a proud</hi>

               <hi>Disregard of</hi> others <hi>even to</hi> talk <hi>of</hi> Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration. <hi>Indeed, I must own I have a high Opinion of my</hi> Principles <hi>and my</hi> Method, <hi>which</hi> Nature <hi>and</hi> GOD's <hi>good Providence have</hi> laid <hi>and</hi> establish'd. <hi>But, as for my Conclusions and Deductions, as I will not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them all with the same Firmness as I did the others; so, I must declare, that did I not really judge them Demonstrative when I</hi> call <hi>them</hi> so, <hi>I should not think</hi> I ought <hi>to propose them as</hi> such; <hi>nor</hi> at all <hi>to the Learned. The World has been sufficiently pester'd already with Books of Philosophy, nay,</hi> Volumes, <hi>blown up to a vast Bulk with</hi> Windy <hi>and Frathy</hi> Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, <hi>and petty</hi> Inconclusive Topicks; <hi>which, like</hi> Rank Weeds, <hi>have over-run that Rich Soil where</hi> Science <hi>ought to have been</hi> Sown; <hi>and I esteem it too poor and mean a Vanity</hi> to plant Briar-fields to enlarge a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness. <hi>If I overween in calling my Proofs,</hi> Demonstrations, <hi>I am willing to take the Shame to my self, if it deserves Shame; tho' perhaps I had been more blame-worthy, if, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> judging <hi>them Demonstrative, I had</hi> min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Truth, <hi>and out of an Affected Modesty, or a Diffidence for which I saw no Ground, I had diminish'd their Force in the esteem of my Readers; and so hinder'd the Profit, which,</hi> startled <hi>at the</hi> Uncouth <hi>Sound of</hi> Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>they might otherwise have reap'd by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into them. For,</hi> DEMONSTRATIONS
<pb facs="tcp:95549:15"/>
               <hi>are Strange</hi> Rarities <hi>in this Sceptical Age; and when those who are to</hi> show <hi>them do</hi> proclame <hi>to the World where they are to be</hi> seen, <hi>Curious People will run in Flocks to view the</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>

And I did</hi> really intend <hi>that Sceptical Men should ask,—</hi>Quid profert dignum tanto promissor hiatu? <hi>That, setting themselves thence to Sift the Nature of my</hi> Method, <hi>and the Force of my Arguments more narrowly, they might better sink into their Understandings; as I am Confident they will, if ever they have perused my</hi> Method <hi>to</hi> Science; <hi>and, by that or any other means, do solidly know what is requisite to a true</hi> Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

10. <hi>Another Reason why I put on this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of Confidence, so little suting with my Natural Complexion, was this. The want of true Science, and the Despair of finding any, had brought such a Luke-warm and Indifferent Humour into the World, (and I wish it were not too common) that, tho' all Men affect to</hi> talk <hi>of</hi> Truth, <hi>and seem in Ordinary Discourse to</hi> value <hi>and</hi> magnifie <hi>her; yet, when it comes to the Point, scarce</hi> one Man <hi>dares heartily profess himself her</hi> Champion, <hi>and declare he will defend her Cause with</hi> Evident Reason, <hi>against all Opposers. For, alas! how</hi> few <hi>Men are there, who will profess to</hi> Demonstrate <hi>in Philosophy, or to reduce their Discourses to</hi> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? <hi>Without doing which, and abiding by the Tryal, perhaps there is not</hi> one Word of Truth <hi>in all Philosophy, nor any thing but</hi> Learned Romance <hi>in all the Universities of</hi> Europe. <hi>Many Men, indeed, do make a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Knowledge, because 'tis Honourable; and every Scholar is</hi> engag'd <hi>to do so, or he will quite lose his</hi> Credit. <hi>But, when it should come to Performance, not one Man in ten thousand shews that</hi> Zeal <hi>for the Advancement of</hi> Truth <hi>as answers to the</hi> Profession <hi>he made to</hi> love <hi>and</hi> esteem <hi>it; but, tho' he sees</hi> Errour <hi>and</hi> Ignorance, <hi>and</hi> Probable Talking <hi>overspread the Face of Philosophy, and stifle</hi> Truth <hi>and</hi> Knowledge <hi>both, he sits still Unconcern'd. Now and then indeed there is a Writer who attempts</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:16"/>
               <hi>to confute this or that particular Errour; some Casual Circumstance addicting him to that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: But, what Man sets himself to</hi> lay the Ax at the Root, <hi>or writes against</hi> Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Methods <hi>and</hi> Groundless Babbling? <hi>What Man goes about to make Mankind aware of the Mischief that comes to Rational Nature by the Sophisticate Ways of talking</hi> prettily, neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>and</hi> wittily; <hi>tho', perhaps, not a Word</hi> Groundedly <hi>and</hi> Solidly? <hi>Nay, what Man is not well-Appay'd and Pleased with a</hi> well-penn'd <hi>Piece; tho', were the</hi> Reason <hi>in it sifted to the Bottom, perhaps there is not</hi> one <hi>Evident</hi> Ttuth <hi>in it to build that Discourse on; that is, not</hi> one <hi>Word of</hi> Sense <hi>in it; but only such a way of Plausible Discourse or Language-Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as may serve equally and indifferently to maintain either side of the Contradiction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. Lastly, <hi>(which is the Chief Point,) Who is there that applies himself to find out a</hi> CER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIN METHOD <hi>to arrive at Truth, and attain Knowledge, without which all our Studies are to no purpose?</hi> Logick <hi>is the Proper Art to give us this</hi> Method; <hi>and I see Students do ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally make use of any Logician, so he but talks d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>yly of the Operations of the Understanding; of Propositions, Syllogisms, and Demonstration; tho', perhaps, he gives not</hi> one <hi>Word of</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>for his</hi> Unprov'd Sayings, <hi>to</hi> enlighten <hi>the Understanding of the Learner, or</hi> inform <hi>him,</hi> (ex Natura rei,) whence <hi>and</hi> why <hi>this</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:16"/>
               <hi>and the other Rudiment, or</hi> Rule, must be so: <hi>Such an Author may indeed enable a Learner</hi> to say as he says, <hi>and talk after him</hi> in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>as it were; but he can never instruct him to</hi> understand <hi>what's</hi> True, <hi>and</hi> why <hi>it is True, or to demonstrate</hi> himself; <hi>which was the main Design of my</hi> METHOD.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>But my greatest Complaint against</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>and my best Excuse for putting my self forwards with such a</hi> Confident Ayr, <hi>is, that I see not that any Learned Men do endeavour to make Head against</hi> Scepticism; <hi>which, thro' this</hi> Universal Connivence, <hi>or rather Civil and Kind</hi> Toleration, <hi>and (in some sort)</hi> Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, <hi>creeps by insensible Degrees into even the most Learned Societies, infects the best Wits of our Nation, threatens to bear down all true Philosophy, to extinguish the Natural Light of Men's Understandings, and drown their best Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> [Reason] <hi>in a Deluge of Profound Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. For, if this Vogue should obtain still in the World to look upon any</hi> loose Discourse <hi>for</hi> brave Sense, <hi>so it be but</hi> sprucely dress'd up <hi>in neat Language, and</hi> Sauc'd <hi>with a little Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quancy of</hi> brisk Wit; <hi>and let it pass current for</hi> True Learning <hi>and</hi> Knowledge; Scepticism <hi>will not only</hi> insinuate <hi>it self slily into all sorts of Men, but be</hi> recommended <hi>to the World by such an Universal Approbation of well-clad gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Ignorance. Nor does this mischievous Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation stop its Career in bereaving us of</hi> Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb facs="tcp:95549:17"/>
Truths; <hi>but, having once darken'd in us the Knowledge of</hi> Nature, <hi>it disposes Men to</hi> doubt of, <hi>and too often to</hi> deny <hi>the Existence of the Author of Nature himself; who is best made known to Mankind by</hi> Science, <hi>or the</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Knowledge <hi>of his</hi> Creatures; <hi>from which we glean all the</hi> Notions, <hi>and, consequently, all the</hi> Knowledge, <hi>we, by Ordinary Means,</hi> have, <hi>or</hi> ought to have. <hi>All these Mischiefs, (I may add, and all Immorality too,) are owing to the Insensible Growth of this Lethargy of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi> SCEPTICISM; <hi>which benums and chills our Intellectual Faculties with a Cold Despair of ever attaining</hi> Evident Knowledge <hi>of any thing; for which, as its Natural Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, our Soul was fitted and ordain'd. I saw this Gloomy Evening overcasting the Clear Sky of</hi> Science, <hi>and drawing on the</hi> Cimmerian <hi>Night of</hi> Dark Ignorance, <hi>and</hi> Black Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; <hi>and thence it was, that, to awaken Men's Souls out of this drowzy Sleep and Torpor of their Mind, I did so often, boldly and fearlessly (tho' as I judg'd,</hi> truly,) declare <hi>and</hi> proclaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud, <hi>that</hi> Demonstration <hi>in Philosophy might be had, and that I had</hi> actually <hi>Demonstrated in such and such Particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. Lastly, <hi>'Tis for</hi> this <hi>Reason, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue all Sincere Lovers of Truth from this spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Contagion of</hi> Scepticism, <hi>that with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual Boldness, I did (as was said before) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to write a</hi> Demonstrative Logick; <hi>to</hi>

            <p n="14">14. <hi>I must not pass over another Complaint made of me by some of the</hi> Cartesian <hi>School;</hi> viz. <hi>That in the Preface to my</hi> METHOD, <hi>I so</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:18"/>
               <hi>deeply Censure</hi> Malbranche <hi>as a Phanatick in Philosophy; nay, the</hi> whole Way it self <hi>as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing to</hi> Enthusiasm. <hi>To the First Part of my Charge, I reply, That I cited that Author's own Words; which are such strong Proofs of a</hi> Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Genius, <hi>that I cannot believe any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mine can add Weight to the Full Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Force they carry'd with them, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that his Philosophy is built upon Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or, as himself expresses it, comes to him</hi> by Revelation. <hi>And, for my pretending that the whole</hi> Cartesian <hi>Way of Philosophizing is of the same Leven, I can need no other Compurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour than that French Author, who with much Exactness wrote the Life of</hi> Cartesius, <hi>and was his good Friend and Follower. The Book is now made English; where in the 34th Page he tells us, that</hi> To get rid of all his Prejudices, <hi>(that is, to</hi> Unlearn, <hi>amongst other Things, all that the</hi> Clear <hi>Light of</hi> Nature <hi>had</hi> taught <hi>him)</hi> Cartesius did undergo no less than to UNMAN himself. <hi>A pretty Self-denying Beginning! And</hi> Pag. 35, 36. <hi>that</hi> he wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out his Mind to that Degree in his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after this <hi>Happy Means,</hi> (viz. <hi>that</hi> his <hi>Imagination</hi> should represent to him his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding quite naked) <hi>that</hi> his Brain took Fire, and he fell into a Spice of <hi>Enthusiasm;</hi> which dispos'd his Mind, already quite spent, in such a manner, that it was fit to receive Impressions of <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Visions.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:18"/>
               <hi>Where we see it confess'd, that his Method of</hi> Unknowing <hi>all that</hi> Nature <hi>had</hi> taught <hi>him, brought him to</hi> Enthusiasm, <hi>and Enthusiasm to</hi> Visions <hi>and</hi> Revelations; <hi>so that</hi> Malbranche <hi>did but follow his Masters Example, and copy'd his Method. The Author proceeds.</hi> He <hi>(Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesius)</hi> acquaints us, that on the 10th of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> 1619. laying himself down <hi>brimful of Enthusiasm, (which is little better than stark mad)</hi> and wholly possess'd with the Thoughts of having found that day <hi>the Foundation of that Wonderful Science,</hi> he had three Dreams presently one after another; yet, so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, as to make him fancy they were sent him <hi>from Above.</hi> He supposed he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd thro' their Shadows, the Tracks of <hi>the Paths</hi> GOD <hi>had chalk'd out to him,</hi> in his Enquiry after Truth. <hi>And is it not a powerful Motive to make all Wits, (especially, if they be of a Melancholy Temper) who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to embrace his Doctrine, which was first</hi> sent from Heaven, <hi>to gape after</hi> Revelations <hi>too, as well as</hi> Malbranche <hi>did? He goes on.</hi> But the <hi>Divine Spiritual Air</hi> which he took a Pride to give to those Dreams, was so near a-kin to that <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> wherewith he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd himself to be warmed, that a Man would have believ'd he had been a little <hi>Crack'd-brain'd. And, lest any should wrong the Original of his Doctrine, or degrade it from the Honour of being given him by Divine Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:19"/>
               <hi>this Author takes off any unfavourable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of ours, that might make it spring from any Sublunary Cause, in these Words:</hi> One would have believ'd he had drunk a Cup too much that Evening before he went to Bed; but he assur'd us he had been very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber all that Day, and that Evening too, and had not drunk a drop of Wine three Weeks together. <hi>This looks as if</hi> Cartesius <hi>himself, who so cautiously inform'd him of this afterwards, was fond to have it thought that his Doctrine, and especially his</hi> Method, <hi>(which was the</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva <hi>of which his Brain was then in Labour,) had been given him</hi> from Above, <hi>by</hi> Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>means.</hi>

            <p n="15">15. <hi>Now, Gentlemen, I beseech you, tell me, in good Sober Sadness; Can you think</hi> GOD <hi>ever intended that the onely</hi> Method <hi>for Men to</hi> get Knowledge, <hi>should be to</hi> lose their Wits first <hi>in looking after it?

            <p n="16">16. <hi>Tho' I forestall what comes hereafter, I am tempted to annex here, to this Character of the</hi> Cartesian <hi>Manner of Spirit in Philosophy, a short Passage mention'd by Mr.</hi> Locke, Book 4. Chap. 7. §. 17. viz. <hi>That he</hi> has discours'd with very Rational Men, who have actually Deny'd they were Men. <hi>Now, certainly, this is something</hi> beyond Enthusiasm, <hi>and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant even to</hi> Madness, <hi>that any Man should</hi> deny <hi>himself to</hi> be what he is: <hi>But, 'tis Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious, that Mr.</hi> Locke <hi>should give such Men the</hi> Elogium <hi>of being</hi> very Rational. <hi>Whence, since he cannot but sincerely judge, that the</hi> Way <hi>he proposes and maintains in his</hi> Essay, <hi>is the</hi> most Rational <hi>of any other; we are to conclude, that those</hi> very Rational Men <hi>did follow this Way of</hi> his, <hi>and were great</hi> Ideists; <hi>or else, that Mr.</hi> Locke <hi>judges that those Men who</hi> actually deny'd themselves to be Men, <hi>might, for all that, according to</hi> his <hi>Way of</hi> Ideas, <hi>be</hi> very Rational <hi>notwithstanding.

18. MAN <hi>being</hi> One Thing, <hi>compounded of a Corporeal and a Spiritual Nature, and every Thing acting as it is, it follows, that both those Natures must concurr to every Operation that flows from him, as he is Man; and, consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, be produced by some</hi> Faculty <hi>belonging proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to each of those respective Natures: Nor can it be doubted, but that, as those Faculties, or Powers, which are peculiar to both those Natures, are as different as are the Natures themselves; so the Immediate</hi> Objects <hi>peculiar to those Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Faculties, must likewise be as widely Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from one another, as are those Powers to which they belong; and, consequently, be as vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Opposite, as the Natures of</hi> Body <hi>and</hi> Spirit <hi>can distance them. It being then agreed to by all Parties, that the Faculties or Powers which join in our Production of Knowledge, are those we call the</hi> Imagination <hi>and the</hi> Mind, <hi>or the</hi> Fancy <hi>and the</hi> Understanding, <hi>I cannot doubt but it may be demonstratively concluded, from the known Nature and Constitution of this Thing called</hi> MAN, <hi>that, to every Thought or Act of Knowledge we have, (those being such Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as properly and formally belong to us as we are</hi> Men,) <hi>there must two sorts of</hi> Interiour Objects <hi>concurr; whereof, the One is of a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, the Other of a Spiritual Nature; and that, otherwise, those Acts could not be said to be</hi> Humane Acts, <hi>or the Acts of that</hi> Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, <hi>or Compound Thing, called</hi> Man; <hi>but of</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:22"/>
one <hi>of those Natures onely,</hi> a-parted <hi>from the</hi> other <hi>as to its</hi> Operation, <hi>and consequently, as to its</hi> Being. <hi>Which Supposition is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to the Natural Constitution of</hi> Man; <hi>as he is distinguish'd, on one side, from a Brute, who has nothing but Material Phantasms, or Ideas; on the other, from an</hi> Angel, <hi>or</hi> Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; <hi>in whom there is nothing of</hi> Matter <hi>or</hi> Fancy, <hi>but all in it is</hi> purely Spiritual.</p>
            <p n="19">19. <hi>The Distinction of these two Objects of the</hi> Fancy <hi>and of the</hi> Understanding <hi>being granted, in some manner, by all Sides, I cannot but wonder how it hapt to escape the Thoughts of all the Philosophers both Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, to explicate fully and clearly the Exact Difference between those two Objects of the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and of the Understanding; there being scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any one Point in Philosophy of half that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance for the attaining of Truth, and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Errour: For both these being truly</hi> in us, <hi>whenever we have an Act of Knowledge; and withall, being as far Removed from one another in their Natures as</hi> Body <hi>and</hi> Spirit <hi>are; if Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Men, either thro' mistake, or thro' In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertence of this vast difference between them, or out of Loathness to take Pains to look deep into the Intrinsecal Natures of Things, imprinted in their Minds when they have Notions of them, shall happen to mistake what they find</hi> Upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <hi>or most</hi> Superficial, <hi>and therefore is easiest to their Fancy, (as</hi> Phantasms <hi>or Material Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:22"/>
               <hi>are) for</hi> Notions; <hi>which, being of a Spiritual Nature, do not make so obvious and familiar an Appearance as those Gay Florid Pictures did, but are to be gather'd by Reason, or made Understood by Reflexion and Study; such Speculaters, I say, will be at the same loss, and not much wiser than those Birds were that peck'd at</hi> Xeuxis<hi>'s Grapes to seed themselves; mistaking the Outward Pourtraiture or Idea for the Inward Nature of the Thing: For, no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Things could ever be expected from</hi> Ideas, <hi>taken (as themselves take them) for</hi> Similitudes; <hi>since those Terms or Words, which we</hi> use, <hi>and</hi> must <hi>use, when we speak or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of any thing whatever, were intended, by the Agreement of Mankind, to signifie the</hi> Things themselves <hi>about which we are Discoursing, and not to signifie meer</hi> Likenesses <hi>or</hi> Similitudes <hi>of them. However this has been neglected by others, I see 'tis my Duty to say something of this Distinction of Phantasms from Notions. I have in my 19th Reflexion,</hi> § § 9, <hi>and</hi> 12. <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to show it. To which I have here thought fit to annex some few</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>or Distinguishing Marks to know one from the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="20">20. <hi>My first</hi> Criterion <hi>shall be the</hi> Sensible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>of the former, and</hi> Insensibleness <hi>of the other. When we shut our Eyes, or walk in the Dark, we experience we have Ideas or Images of our Way, or of other things we have seen, in our</hi> Fancy; <hi>and this, without the least Labour</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:23"/>
               <hi>of ours, or any Reflexion: And there is also</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that, <hi>something else in the Mind, which tells us of what</hi> Nature, <hi>or what</hi> Things <hi>those are, which appear'd superficially to our Fancy; which costs us Labour and Reflexion to bring it into the view of the Understanding, so that we cannot get perfect Acquaintance with it, unless we</hi> define <hi>it. Nor is this</hi> Sensible, <hi>as the other was, but only</hi> Intelligible: <hi>Not</hi> superficial <hi>or</hi> uppermost; <hi>but</hi> hidden, retruse, <hi>and (as we may say)</hi> stands behind the Curtain <hi>of the Fancy: Nor easie to comprehend at the first Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Sight of our Inward Eye, but costs us some Reflexion, or some Pains, to know it expressly and distinctly. Which latter sort, in each of these regards, are those we call Simple</hi> Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Conceptions, <hi>or</hi> Notions.</p>
            <p n="21">21. <hi>The next</hi> Criterion <hi>shall be this: We find we have in us</hi> Meanings; <hi>now the</hi> Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <hi>of Words, or (which is the same, taking that word</hi> objectively, what's meant <hi>by those Words,) are most evidently the same Spiritual Objects as are our Notions, and 'tis Impossible those</hi> Meanings <hi>should be the same with</hi> Ideas <hi>or</hi> Similitudes, <hi>but of a quite different Nature. Let it be as</hi> Like <hi>the thing as 'tis possible, 'tis not the Likeness of it which we aim at in our Language: For we do not</hi> intend <hi>or</hi> mean <hi>when we speak of any thing, to talk or discourse of</hi> what's Like <hi>that</hi> Thing, <hi>but of what's the</hi> same <hi>with it, or rather</hi> what that thing it
<pb facs="tcp:95549:23"/>
self is; <hi>which the meer Similitude of a thing cannot possibly be. For a</hi> Similitude <hi>being</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>to the Thing, is so far from being</hi> that <hi>Thing, or the</hi> Same as It is, <hi>that it is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> Opposite <hi>to it; that is, quite Distinct from it. Now, that what's essentially and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi> Distinct <hi>from a Thing, nay</hi> Opposite <hi>to it, should of it self, and by it self alone, give us the First Knowledge of</hi> It, <hi>(as they put their Ideas to do;) or that the Meaning of the</hi> one <hi>should be the Meaning of the</hi> other, <hi>is utterly Unintelligible, and against Common Sense. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the</hi> Meaning, <hi>which is the Immediate and Proper Object of the</hi> Mind, <hi>and which</hi> gives us, <hi>or rather</hi> is <hi>the First Notice of the Thing, must be of a quite different Nature from an</hi> Idea <hi>or</hi> Likeness <hi>of it; and since there can be no Middle between</hi> Like <hi>and the</hi> Same; <hi>nor any nearer Approach or Step, proceeding from</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>towards</hi> Unity <hi>with the Thing, but it falls into</hi> Identity, <hi>it must necessarily be</hi> more than Like it; <hi>that is, the</hi> Same with it; <hi>which an</hi> Idea <hi>or</hi> Likeness <hi>cannot possibly be, as was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved lately.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="22">22. <hi>The Third</hi> Criterion <hi>which confirms the other, shall be this: None denies but Brutes have</hi> Ideas <hi>or</hi> Similitudes <hi>in their Fancy; but they can have no</hi> Meanings, <hi>because they have no</hi> Spiritual <hi>Part or</hi> Mind, <hi>only which can</hi> mean. <hi>Hence, all the Sounds or Noises they make, express only</hi> Passion, <hi>or some</hi> Corporeal
<pb facs="tcp:95549:24"/>
               <hi>Easiness or Uneasiness which they feel, and not their</hi> Thoughts <hi>or</hi> Meaning: <hi>As appears by this; that they can never come to know what the Words we use do</hi> mean <hi>or</hi> signifie; <hi>nor can those of them that can</hi> speak, <hi>adapt the Words they pronunce to</hi> our meaning, <hi>nor answer us</hi> pertinently; <hi>which Reflexion serves to shew us farther the vast Difference between</hi> Ideas <hi>and</hi> Meanings, <hi>or between</hi> Phantasms <hi>and</hi> Notions.</p>
            <p n="23">23. <hi>My Third</hi> Criterion <hi>is taken from the Evident Difference between an Idea or Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a Thing, and its Definition; of which see</hi> Method to Science, Book 1. Less. 2. § 24. <hi>towards the End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="24">24. <hi>My Fourth</hi> Criterion <hi>is, That we are as certain we have General Notions, as that we have Particular ones; nay, we can conceive them</hi> as General; <hi>that is, we can conceive their</hi> Generality. <hi>If then we have an</hi> Idea <hi>or</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>of</hi> Universality, <hi>or</hi> Generality, What is it like? <hi>It must either be</hi> Like the Thing, <hi>or must be</hi> like Nothing, <hi>and so is no</hi> Idea <hi>or</hi> Likeness <hi>at all. But it cannot be</hi> like <hi>the</hi> Thing <hi>in any respect, because in the Thing there is nothing that is</hi> General <hi>or</hi> Universal; <hi>but all that is</hi> there <hi>is Particular and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd; which is quite</hi> Unlike, <hi>nay,</hi> Opposite <hi>to Universality or Generality. 'Tis Evident then, that we have no</hi> Idea <hi>or</hi> Likeness <hi>of an</hi> Universal <hi>in our Meaning or Notion, when we</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:24"/>
               <hi>use or hear the Words that signifie it. On the other side, we have a Notion of</hi> Homo, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, <hi>and</hi> Ens; <hi>and still a</hi> Clearer <hi>one according as they are more General. Wherefore, 'tis like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise evident, that our</hi> Notions <hi>are of a quite different Nature from</hi> Ideas <hi>or</hi> Similitudes.</p>
            <p n="25">25. <hi>I shall leave the pursuing this Point any farther, and give the Reader some Taste before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of what (perhaps) he will be</hi> cloy'd <hi>with in the following Book; especially it will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to</hi> season <hi>his Understanding with some few Notions concerning the</hi> main Question <hi>between the</hi> Ideists <hi>and</hi> me, viz. <hi>Whether our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is made by the</hi> Things <hi>being in our Mind when we know it, or an</hi> Idea <hi>or</hi> Similitude <hi>of it only. In order to which I ask the</hi> Ideists, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Modes or Accidents are</hi> Distinct Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <hi>from the</hi> Substance <hi>or</hi> Thing? <hi>To which I am sure Mr.</hi> Locke <hi>will say,</hi> They are not. <hi>Hence I argue, Therefore, if the Modes or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents be not</hi> Distinct really <hi>from the</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>the Substance or Thing is not</hi> really, <hi>(or</hi> in re,) <hi>distinguish'd from the Modes or Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: Therefore they are (as they are in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or</hi> in re) <hi>the</hi> same Thing, <hi>or</hi> Identify'd. <hi>Therefore they are only distinguish'd by the</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding conceiving <hi>the same Thing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly; therefore 'tis onely the</hi> Conceptions <hi>of our Understandings which are</hi> Distinct. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taking the word</hi> [Conception] objective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>that is, for the</hi> Thing Conceiv'd; <hi>all we</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:25"/>
               <hi>conceive is still the</hi> Thing. <hi>Therefore all our Notions, both of the</hi> Substance <hi>and of its Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents or</hi> Modes, <hi>that is, all the Notions we can have, (they being the same with our Conceptions,) are nothing but the</hi> Thing <hi>conceiv'd diversly. Therefore, if that Thing be a</hi> Body, <hi>all our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it are meerly that Thing call'd</hi> Body <hi>diversly conceiv'd. Therefore the putting</hi> Space, Succession, <hi>&amp;c. where there neither</hi> is <hi>nor</hi> can be <hi>any Body, is to put Body where there is</hi> no Body; <hi>and, is a meer Fancy, and Contradictory. Therefore those Philosophers who proceed upon</hi> our <hi>Grounds, do still</hi> Conceive, Judge <hi>and</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course <hi>of the</hi> Thing. <hi>Therefore the Knowledge they gain by such</hi> Notions <hi>is the</hi> Knowledge of the Thing; <hi>the Judgments they make by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necting those Notions, are Connexions of the</hi> thus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguish'd <hi>Parts (as it were) of the</hi> Thing; <hi>and the</hi> Discourses <hi>they make, Discourses</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the very</hi> Thing. <hi>Therefore the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy of such Men is truly and entirely the</hi> Knowledge of the Things, <hi>or</hi> True Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. <hi>Wherefore those who have only in their Minds</hi> SIMILITUDES <hi>or</hi> IDEAS, <hi>and do only Connect or Discourse of</hi> them, <hi>which</hi> Ideas <hi>are</hi> not <hi>the</hi> Thing, <hi>nor conceiv'd to be</hi> It <hi>either</hi> in whole, <hi>or</hi> in part, <hi>are convinced to build their Discourses (thus grounded) upon</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>Therefore they have</hi> no Solid Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>of</hi> any Thing. <hi>Therefore, in proper Speech, they</hi> know Nothing. <hi>Therefore all</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:25"/>
               <hi>their Philosophy (thus built) is purely</hi> Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I infer farther, that, since this Distinction of the</hi> Thing <hi>into</hi> Substance <hi>(precisely consider'd) and its</hi> Modes <hi>or</hi> Accidents, <hi>is perform'd only</hi> by the Understanding; <hi>therefore it is made</hi> within the Understanding. <hi>Therefore since this</hi> Act, <hi>that</hi> thus <hi>Distinguishes them, is not</hi> Transitive <hi>to the Thing which is</hi> out of it, <hi>the Thing must be</hi> in the Understanding <hi>to be</hi> there <hi>Distinguish'd; otherwise we should Distinguish we</hi> Know not what; <hi>which (it being done by a</hi> Knowing Power) <hi>is impossible, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Contradiction. Therefore the</hi> Thing it self <hi>must</hi> forcibly <hi>be intellectually</hi> in the Mind: <hi>Therefore, there can need no</hi> Ideas <hi>or Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes to make us</hi> know it; <hi>for to be</hi> in a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power <hi>is</hi> to be known, <hi>without more ado.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis incredibly Strange, and even Monstrous, that Mr.</hi> Locke<hi>'s Thoughts and mine, like</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes, <hi>should move Diametrically</hi> Opposit <hi>to one another in</hi> this <hi>Point. He tells us,</hi> B. 4. Ch. 23. <hi>in his Margin, that</hi> there is no Abstract Idea of Substance; <hi>nor</hi> can we <hi>(as he there says)</hi> by the Sensible Qualities have any Idea of the Substance of Body, <hi>more than</hi> if we knew nothing at all. <hi>And, the Essences or Entities of</hi> Particular Substances <hi>(as clearest Reason demonstrates,) are incomparably</hi> harder <hi>to be</hi> known, <hi>than Substance</hi> in the Abstract; <hi>whence we must, consequently, know</hi> less than nothing
<pb facs="tcp:95549:26"/>
               <hi>of</hi> Them, <hi>if we know</hi> nothing at all <hi>of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: It being impossible to know what</hi> This Thing <hi>or</hi> This Man <hi>is, if we be Ignorant what</hi> Thing <hi>or</hi> Man <hi>is. Nor have we any</hi> Innate Ideas <hi>(as he confesses) to make</hi> [Substance] <hi>known. If, then neither</hi> Innate <hi>nor</hi> Acquir'd Ideas <hi>can make us know any thing at all of it, and we can know nothing</hi> but by Ideas; <hi>'tis plain, we cannot know</hi> Thing <hi>or</hi> Substance at all, <hi>and so we must rest contented with</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nothing. <hi>For,</hi> Substance <hi>being unknown, 'tis impossible to know any</hi> Mode <hi>or</hi> Accident; <hi>they being essentially certain</hi> Manners how a Thing is; <hi>and, so, including</hi> Substance <hi>and</hi> Thing <hi>in their</hi> Definition. <hi>Again, Mr.</hi> L. <hi>holds we can frame no Idea of</hi> Substance, <hi>or at most but a most blindly</hi> Obscure <hi>one; and</hi> I <hi>hold that the Notion of it is</hi> most Clear, <hi>nay, the</hi> Clearest of any <hi>but that of</hi> Existence, <hi>exprest by the word</hi> [is.] <hi>He thinks that the nature of</hi> Accidents <hi>is known</hi> by themselves, <hi>tho' the</hi> Substance <hi>ly in the dark from us: And I judge it Demonstrable that, as they have no</hi> Entity <hi>of their own, but by means of the</hi> Thing, Ens <hi>or</hi> Substance, <hi>so they can have no</hi> Intelligibility <hi>(which is a Property of</hi> Ens) <hi>of their own, but meerly by virtue of the Substance or</hi> Thing <hi>with which they are Identify'd. In a word, He thinks Substance is</hi> most Unknown, <hi>and I say, 'tis</hi> self-evidently Known. <hi>He says it</hi> cannot <hi>be known Clearly; and</hi> I <hi>say it not only</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95549:26"/>
can, <hi>but</hi> must <hi>be known clearly; nay, that</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else <hi>can be known but</hi> It, <hi>or by being</hi> It.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By this Discourse it appears, that this Point being (of its own Nature) of</hi> Universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; <hi>and, therefore, drawing Great and most Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Consequences after it, which, acting here as a Philosopher, I do not mention; either He or I must be in a most Dangerous Errour. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, being</hi> perfectly assured <hi>that the</hi> Method <hi>I take will not permit me to erre Enormously; and,</hi> very certain <hi>that I follow very faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that</hi> Method; <hi>I humbly beg of Mr.</hi> Locke, <hi>by that Candour and Ingenuity, of which (I doubt not,</hi> sincerely <hi>too) he has made so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Professions, that he would please to apply his Thoughts anew (for if</hi> Second Thoughts <hi>be</hi> Better, <hi>the</hi> Last <hi>may be</hi> Best of all) <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view his</hi> Way of Ideas; <hi>and, comparing it with what I have propos'd and prov'd in my</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to Science, <hi>my</hi> Preliminaries, <hi>and my several</hi> Reflexions <hi>on his</hi> Essay, <hi>he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byassedly consider, whether (since he cannot sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his own Excellent Parts) this</hi> New Way <hi>of Philosophizing be not the Sole Cause of all his Mistakes, and misleads him into all these Great Errours; to entertain which this Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastick Method has inveigled his good Reason.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:95549:27"/>
               <hi>chief Excuse is, that, being to</hi> trace <hi>and</hi> follow <hi>his Discourses, I could not well avoid it; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping withall, at the same time, to clear the Point better; either by some</hi> New Thought, <hi>which then</hi> occurr'd, <hi>or by giving a better Turn to my</hi> former <hi>Arguments. Besides, I must confess, that I did now and then</hi> affect <hi>these</hi> Repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>to make some Particulars which were of most Weight</hi> sink better <hi>into the Judgment of my Readers, by</hi> re-minding <hi>them often of such Important</hi> Truths. <hi>I am forced to use the Word</hi> [Idea] <hi>often, because Mr.</hi> Locke <hi>(with whom I am discoursing) does so</hi> always; <hi>tho' generally I join</hi> Notions <hi>to it. But, this one Note will keep my true Sentiment from being misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; that I allow</hi> Ideas <hi>or</hi> Resemblances <hi>in the</hi> Fancy <hi>or</hi> Imagination; <hi>but, I absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there are any</hi> Spiritual Ideas <hi>or</hi> Similitudes <hi>in the</hi> Mind <hi>on which we</hi> ground <hi>any</hi> Truth, <hi>or which are the</hi> Materials of Knowledge; <hi>but</hi> NOTIONS <hi>only, or the</hi> Things <hi>abstractedly or inadequately</hi> conceiv'd <hi>by the Understanding.</hi>

                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95549:28"/>
2. This premis'd, my first Preliminary Reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion shall be upon his making use, throughout his whole Work, of <note place="margin">The using the word <hi>[Idea]</hi> in dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Senses, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs the way to <hi>Science.</hi>
                  </note> the word <hi>(IDEAS)</hi> as the Chief, or rather only <hi>Materials,</hi> of which, according to him, we are to frame immediately all our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. Which being so, it follows that, if the sense of that word be not it self <hi>Clear,</hi> but <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal;</hi> and if, as taken in <hi>one</hi> Sense, it be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly <hi>nothing</hi> at all to <hi>Science,</hi> nor can be any <hi>Material</hi> of it; and, as taken in the other, it <hi>may</hi> and <hi>must</hi> conduce to it, nay, be the <hi>Sole</hi> ime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Ground and Origin of <hi>all</hi> Science; I cannot but think, that the promiscuous usage of that Word in such Disparate Senses, (it being of so general Concern, and running through that whole Book) must necessarily encumber and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex in a high Measure the way to Scientifical knowledge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. One of his Secondary Designes was (as he expresses himself in his <hi>Epistle to the Reader)</hi> to <hi>remove the Rubbish</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Philosophical Words generally used, not to be laid a side without great Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity.</note> in order to the building up Science, and to beat down the <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> of those who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <hi>Philosophy, which is nothing but the Knowledge of Things,</hi> to insignificant School-Terms. This is certainly a very necessary and a very laudable Design; it being evident to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Lovers of Truth, that never was there more need of a Reformation, than there has been of Philosophy in these last <hi>Centuries;</hi> to second him in which I have not failed on my part to contribute my endeavours. Yet, notwithstanding
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95549:28"/>
I do not think we ought, without great and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary occasion, alter those words which have been accepted and used by the Learned World (such as it was) hitherto: Especially such words as are <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>Univocal,</hi> such I take the word <hi>[Notion]</hi> to be; much less to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute another, which I must <note place="margin">Much less chang'd for others <hi>less proper.</hi>
                  </note> think is <hi>less proper,</hi> and withall highly Equivocal, or <hi>Ambiguous,</hi> I mean the word <hi>(IDEA.)</hi> I know this inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Author apologizes for his frequent using it; and I am apt to think he did this out of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility towards our Modern Philosophers, who have brought it into fashion: For, he gives no reason why he did not rather constantly use the word <hi>(Notion;)</hi> which, importing a part of <hi>Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> does most certainly better suit with a Treatise about <hi>Human Understanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. As for the Sense in which he takes the word <hi>(IDEA)</hi> he professes that he <hi>uses it to express whatever is meant by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>L's</hi> Acception of the word <hi>[Idea]</hi> very Ambiguous.</note> 
                  <hi>Phantasm, Notion, Species, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is that the mind can be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd about in thinking.</hi> Which manifests that he uses that word very <hi>Equivocally:</hi> For a <hi>Phantasm,</hi> and a <hi>Notion,</hi> differ as widely, as <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> the one being a <hi>Corporeal,</hi> the other a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Resemblance; or rather, the one being a Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, or a kind of <hi>Image,</hi> or Picture; the other the <hi>thing Resembled,</hi> as will be seen hereafter. Again, 'tis agreed to by all the World, that Brutes have <hi>Phantasms,</hi> but they can have no <hi>Notions;</hi> for these are the <hi>Elements,</hi> or <hi>Materialls,</hi> whose agreeable Connexion furnishes our Mind with <hi>Science;</hi> of which Beasts, which have <hi>no</hi>

                  <hi>Mind,</hi> are incapable; and therefore it were both unnatural, and to no purpose, to put <hi>Notions</hi> (which are the Primary Affections of the <hi>Mind)</hi> in those <hi>meer Animals.</hi> I am more at a loss to find, that, in the last page but one in his Epistle to the Reader, he seems to contradistinguish <hi>Notions</hi> to <hi>Ideas;</hi> which how it consists with the indifferency he grants the word <hi>(Idea)</hi> here to signify <hi>Notions,</hi> I cannot at all comprehend.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I must confess, it is generally a fruitless contest to dispute about a <hi>Word,</hi> which is nothing but a Sound, or <note place="margin">The Ambiguity of it not clear'd by him.</note> a Character, were but the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Meaning of it told us by the user of it: Let it be A, or B, or what he pleases, provided the distinct Sense of it be clearly manifested by the Writer, or Speaker, it were, in that case, Logomachy, and impertinent Cavil, to except against it. But, when the Author's own Explication of it does, (contrary to the Nature of Explications) declare it is used ambiguously, it laies a force on me to remark it; lest it may lead the Reader, (as it infallibly must) into great Errors, unless it's double Sense be warily distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht in the ensuing discourse; which I have not observed to be done any where by this other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise accurate Author.</p>
               <p n="6">6. From this undistinguish'd Ambiguity of the word <hi>(Idea)</hi> it follows naturally, that even his own excellent Judgment, and consequently, his Reader's, must necessarily sometimes deviate; and, tho' his general intention was only to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue the <hi>Knowledge of Things,</hi> yet he must needs be sometimes mis<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95549:29"/>
be shown hereafter. For the present I cannot omit one particular, it being of such main im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Author believes <hi>all sorts of Animals</hi> to have, in <hi>some</hi> degree, <hi>Perception.</hi> Now <hi>Perception</hi> (as I conceive) <note place="margin">The putting <hi>Brutes</hi> to have Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, associates them with <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi>
                  </note> signifies <hi>Knowledge;</hi> for, under what sort of <hi>material</hi> Action to rank it, I confess my self at a loss: But, let it be only the <hi>first step and degree towards Knowledge, and the in-let of all the Materials of it,</hi> still he says, the <hi>dulness of the faculties</hi> of some Brutes, <hi>makes them remote from that Knowledge which is to be found in some Men:</hi> So that it seems in <hi>other</hi> Men there may possibly be <hi>no more</hi> Knowledge (at least in some things) than in <hi>Brutes;</hi> nor does he any more than <hi>probably conjecture,</hi> that Beasts have not the <hi>power of comparing, which may be observed in M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Now, if this be so, all those who hold that <hi>(a Rational Animal)</hi> is a proper and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate Definition of <hi>(Man)</hi> ought to hold <hi>Brutes</hi> to be <hi>Men.</hi> Mr. <hi>L.</hi> will say, that Brutes can only reason in <hi>Particulars,</hi> having no <hi>General Ideas,</hi> because they cannot <hi>Abstract;</hi> nor do we see they make use of any <hi>General Signes</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Universal <hi>Ideas:</hi> Indeed, they have no such Signes as <hi>Words,</hi> to notify they have any such <hi>Ideas;</hi> but, if we may conclude from their <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Actions</hi> (on which only Mr. <hi>L.</hi> seems to ground his good Opinion of them that they have <hi>Reason,)</hi> we may as well gather from the same ground that they have <hi>General Ideas</hi> too. For example, when a Horse sees a Man a far off, he can only have an <hi>Idea</hi> that it is <hi>something;</hi> for the Object cannot, at that distance, imprint a <hi>more particular Idea</hi> of it self, but that <hi>most General</hi> one, and therefore 'tis evident the Horse must either have a <hi>General Idea</hi> of it, or none at all; whereas yet he must have <hi>some Idea</hi> of it, because he <hi>sees</hi> it, though confusedly. Coming nearer, the Object imprints a <hi>more distinct Idea</hi> of a <hi>Man;</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95549:30"/>
yet not so distinct, as to represent <hi>this</hi> Man in <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</hi> At length coming very near, the same Object is apt to imprint an <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>this</hi> particular Man; which shews plainly, that all those <hi>Ideas</hi> the Object gave him <hi>before</hi> were <hi>General</hi> ones: To proceed, we may observe, that while it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd only to be <hi>something,</hi> which was a very <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract Idea,</hi> the Horse carry'd it <hi>abstractedly</hi> too, and remain'd unconcern'd. When it appear'd to be a <hi>Man,</hi> it began to be a little concern'd, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to do with such kind of things as us'd to do it either Good or Harm; and therefore it stares at it (a common carriage in sheep especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) as if it study'd, or consider'd, what to make of it, in order to its own Interest, or Self-preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. But, when the Object imprints an <hi>Idea</hi> of this <hi>particular</hi> Man, who either us'd to bring him Provender, or come to catch him to make him work, he either comes towards him, or runs away; which different behaviour of theirs (if outward Actions were, in this case, worth buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on) is as good a sign that Brutes have <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ideas,</hi> as we can expect from dumb Animals. Besides, when a Cat, or Dog is hungry, and hunts about for Meat, how can Mr. <hi>L.</hi> imagin they long only for one <hi>particular</hi> sort of Meat, and not <hi>any</hi> sort of Meat in <hi>common</hi> that is agreeable to their nature? I am sure their indifferency to any such Food (in case they <hi>know at all)</hi> gives us as good ground to think they have a <hi>General Idea</hi> of such a <hi>sort, kind,</hi> or <hi>species</hi> of Food, as it does for any Knowledge they have of <hi>particulars.</hi> Hence is shown, that Mr. <hi>L</hi>'s Criterion, or distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Mark to know them from <hi>Men, (viz.</hi> the having <hi>General Idea</hi>'s) quite failing, we ought to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95549:31"/>
esteem Horses, and other Cattle, to be Four-foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, or else Men must be two-legg'd Beasts. Moreover, since he grants here §. 5. they can <hi>compare</hi> those <hi>Ideas</hi> they have, tho' <hi>imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and but in <hi>some circumstances;</hi> and all <hi>Judging,</hi> and <hi>Discoursing</hi> must, by his Doctrine, consist in the <hi>comparing Ideas;</hi> he must think there are some of them who are very <hi>judicious</hi> Gentlemen, and use natural Logick, and, tho' not very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially, make Syllogisms too. In a word, if we have no pecular Faculties Intrinsecal to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor any Primary Operation belonging to <hi>it,</hi> and <hi>it only,</hi> to distinguish us from Brutes but Extrinsecal shape only, all <hi>Beasts</hi> might be <hi>Men,</hi> and Men <hi>Beasts:</hi> And then we ought in duty to consider how to correct our Carriage towards our <hi>dear Brethren in Nature,</hi> Brutes; which will bring in the <hi>Turkish</hi> Charity to Dogs, and twenty other Fooleries: And, 'tis an excellent Argument to prove the Identity of our Natures, that Mr. <hi>L.</hi> brings of some Gentlemen he was acquainted with, <hi>who deny'd themselves to be Men;</hi> and I wonder he would civilly give them the Lye, by passing upon them the Complement that they were notwithstanding <hi>very Rational Men;</hi> for, were it possible any Man could be a Beast, 'tis most certain these Men were such. But I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not all at such extravagant Conceits; for as Reason, grounded on our Natural Notions of the Thing, is reduced, if pursued home, to First and Self-evident Principles; so <hi>Fancy,</hi> if follow'd close, advances at length to pure <hi>Folly,</hi> and ends finally in perfect <hi>Madness.</hi>

8. As for us <hi>Men,</hi> we can certainly affirm, that <hi>we do</hi> truly <hi>perceive,</hi> or <hi>know,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we <hi>know</hi> certainly, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, <note place="margin">The first considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion pre-requir'd, ere we ought to think that Brutes <hi>know.</hi>
                  </note> or rather by Reflexion, that <hi>we do know;</hi> but we do not <hi>thus</hi> know that <hi>Brutes</hi> know; and whoever thinks he can ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it by <hi>Reason,</hi> ought, I conceive, er'e he goes about it, to study exactly two previous points. First, he ought to consider very attentively, how, or upon what Grounds he can imagin <hi>Particles of Matter,</hi> tho' never so subtil and artificially laid together, can be capable of <hi>Perception,</hi> or <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or how this Suits with the Nature of <hi>meer Body.</hi> We can only gather this from <hi>Local Motions</hi> proceeding from Brutes, with some kind of Regularity: Now an exact Watch (in proportion to its few parts) does, by vertue of a Spring within, which is part of its self, afford the same argument to one that is not aware of its contrivance. For, it shews us, and regularly too, the Minutes, Quarters, Half-hours, Hours, Days of the Month, and tells us the time aloud by Striking the Bell: Nay, a Repeating-Clock does, without Missing, or Mistake, <hi>answer</hi> the Question (as it were) which by pulling the String you <hi>ask</hi> it; and, tho' you are never so importune in repeating your question often, yet it still answers truth, with more steady exactness than <hi>Banks</hi> his Horse could, by seeing the Motion of his Masters Eye. Yet, if any Man had drawn thence a Conclusion that those Engins had <hi>perciev'd,</hi> or <hi>known,</hi> we are satisfied that he had been perfectly mistaken. An <hi>Italian</hi> here had an Engine which would both a wake one at the hour he designed to rise, and

The Case had been still more difficult, had this Watch, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, which seemed self moving, been put into all these Motions by Subtil and Indiscernable Agents; as Iron is by the <hi>Effluuiums</hi> of a Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, or as <hi>Memnons</hi> Musical Statue was by the Rayes of the Sun; for in that Case the Vulgar, discerning no Material Cause that set it on work, would presently have had recourse to some <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power</hi> in the Engine; in the same manner as when they hear noises in a House, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find out what caused them, they imediately conclude 'tis a Spright. Whence results this plain Rule, that er'e we can with <hi>reason conclude, or think any thing, except our selves, has Perception, or Knowledge, by our seeing it perform any Outward Action, we ought first to be certain that we can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all the Operations of Bodies, and all the several Combinations and Contrivances of them; and that we see that those Actions are impossible to be performed by Bodily parts,</hi> laid <hi>together by an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wise Artificer; before we fall to imagin that any meerly Animal Body is more than a Natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; or that it does any more perceive, think, or know, than does a Watch or Clock.</hi>

them <hi>all:</hi> And, besides, it is necessary also to weigh attentively the Chymical parts (if I may be allowed to call them so) of an <hi>Animal,</hi> consisting of <hi>Blood,</hi> the Humours in it, and especially the <hi>Spirits;</hi> which last are apt to be moved, upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, by the least touch of all the Bodies about it, nay, by the most minute particles of them, lodged in the brain and excited there a fresh; and are withall apt to be carried thence in convenient Vehicles throughout the whole, to set on motion those parts which are more solid: When he has done this, let him Consider all these diverse-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red parts laid together by the All-wise Contriver of Nature, in order to the Animal's pursuing what's Agreeable to its nature, and avoiding what's Disagreeable to it: When, I say, all these particulars are well weigh'd, and duely reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, I believe we shall be at a loss to pitch upon any <hi>outward Notion with</hi> such wise Contextures, and the Complexion of such innumerable Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Causes may not naturally produce.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95549:33"/>
on these, let us reflect on our selves, even when <hi>perfectly awake,</hi> and we shall discover that, however we are set on work by Motives, or Reasons, yet we know not at all how the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> parts of our Body (only <hi>which</hi> we experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Brutes, and ground the conceit of their having Knowledge upon them) do perform any of their Operations. What Man living, though supposed the wisest (much less the Generality) knows <hi>how,</hi> or <hi>by what</hi> passages he is to send A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Spirits into the <hi>Muscles</hi> (whence all our Motion proceeds) or into <hi>what</hi> Muscles, or what <hi>quantity</hi> of them is requisit to do such an Outward Action? What Feats of Activity does a Rope-dancer show us? How many ways does he distort, wind, turn, poize, stretch, and ply the parts of his Body? To do which, the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits are to be sent now into <hi>this,</hi> now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>that</hi> Muscle, to move this or <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Limb, or Joint; sometimes <hi>great quantity</hi> of them to make a vehement, or quick Motion; sometimes <hi>fewer,</hi> to move them more moderately; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>none at all</hi> into any of them, when he has a mind to surcease all Motion, and sit still. Yet he knows, no more than a Brute, or a Stone does, <hi>how</hi> he is to do any of this, nor can give the least account <hi>how</hi> it is done. All this is transa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the wise Contrivance of the Body; which is so framed as to be subservient to the Design the Man, as he is Knowing and Rational, had projected. And the same is done in <hi>Brutes,</hi> when either actual Impressions are made upon them from the Objects; or those former Impressions are again excited in the Brain; which done, all the frisking motions of Pursuance and Avoidance which they perform, do follow by a Course of

So that the Watches acting <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to reason,</hi> demonstrates indeed there was Reason in the <hi>Framer</hi> of it, but argues none at all in the <hi>Engine</hi> it self: Wherefore, however the Actions of some Brutes may bear a <hi>show</hi> of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, this can only argue that they are the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship of a <hi>Rational,</hi> or <hi>Wise Maker;</hi> but, not that themselves acted <hi>knowingly,</hi> or <hi>rationally,</hi> while they did these Actions: For my self, I must declare, that I have as much admired the wisdom shewn in the Action of a young Vine, exerting and twisting its little Fingers about other things near it, to support it self as it grew up, as (all the forementioned Circumstances weighed and abated) at any Operation of a Brute; and I doubt not but a <hi>Campanella</hi> (who maintained that every thing in Nature had <hi>perception)</hi> or some such other man of fancy, would discourse, and descant on it thus: "The poor week limber
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95549:34"/>
Vine knew, and was well aware, that, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to support it self, it would, when it increast in length, fall down flat on the ground, and so be exposed to be trampled under foot, and hurt; and, therefore, did <hi>very prudently</hi> cling about other Vegetables, or Poles near it, to sustain it self, and avoid that inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence." And, I dare affirm that we lose the best part of our Natural Contemplation, by putting Brutes to have <hi>Knowledge;</hi> for, what wonder is there that such things as have a <hi>knowing Power</hi> in them should know, or, who admires it in a Man? Whereas, it justly raises our mind to high Admiration and Adoration of the Divine Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, to see things which are made of <hi>meer Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> act with as much Wisdom and Prudence for their own preservation, as the wisest Knower can by his best Wit, of which he is so proud, and sometimes with much more. No doubt but the growth and operations of dull Vegetables, do administer to devout Reflecters occasions of very high Contemplation; and shall the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>sensitive</hi> Beings, which are incomparably <hi>more</hi> excellent, and <hi>more</hi> admirable, as being the Top and Master-piece of this Material World, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford little, or none at all? Now, if their <hi>Nature</hi> be to have <hi>Knowledge</hi> in them, and it be a thing common to all Creatures, and expected that <hi>GOD</hi> should give to every thing what is its <hi>Nature,</hi> there is little or no particular ground for our wonderment. <hi>GOD</hi> has given Brutes a <hi>Knowing Power,</hi> and that <hi>Power</hi> makes them <hi>know,</hi> and there's an end of our Admiration, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of our Contemplation, and of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Admiration, to which our Astonishment at

               <p n="12">12. I beg pardon for this long digression; I thought fit to dilate thus largely on this point; both because it <note place="margin">Brutes have <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasms,</hi> but no <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> or <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
                  </note> is a very concerning and useful Preliminary; as also to manifest how the using the word <hi>(Idea)</hi> hand over head (as we may say) and taking it <hi>Equivocally</hi> and indifferently for <hi>Phantasms</hi> and <hi>Notions,</hi> leads this Great Man (as it must needs have done every Man) into great mistakes. For <hi>Phantasms</hi> Beasts may indeed have, they being no more but <hi>Effluuiums</hi> emitted from other Bodies, and received by the portalls of the <hi>Senses</hi> into the Brain; where the Animal Spirits stand readily waiting to move the Brute, according as those Tinctures are agreeable, or disagreeable, to the Compound: but <hi>Notions,</hi> or (which is the same) <hi>Meanings,</hi> or <hi>Apprehensions,</hi> they cannot have; for <hi>these</hi> being made by Direct Impressions upon our <hi>Spiritual</hi> part, the <hi>Mind,</hi> (only which can <hi>mean,</hi> or <hi>apprehend)</hi> to judge they have any such, would conclude they had a <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently an <hi>Immortal</hi> part in them, which I am sure we shall both of us deny. Besides, had they <hi>Meanings,</hi> or were capable of any, they would be capable of the <hi>Meanings</hi> of our Words; at least those amongst them which are most Docil, and could Speak, would not fail, if well taught, and educated, to <hi>know</hi> much of our Language, and <hi>Answer,</hi> in some few occasions, <hi>Pertinently;</hi> which none of them ever did <hi>designedly,</hi> and, if they <hi>hap</hi> to do so by accident, none thinks they <hi>meant</hi> as they <hi>spoke,</hi> but all mankind <hi>laughs</hi> at the odd
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95549:35"/>
Chance, as at a pleasant Jest. Those that teach them might point at the things when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their Names, as Nurses do to little Infants; and why might not Beasts learn them, as well as Children; at least learn as much in many years, as they do in two, or three? Indeed, some Words and Sounds, which are very often used to come into their Brain, accompanied with some pleasing or harmful <hi>Phantasm,</hi> do, by vertue of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant <hi>Phantasm,</hi> affect them, and make them act; not from their knowing what these words, or interjections <hi>mean,</hi> but by vertue of the <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasms,</hi> or <hi>Effluviums,</hi> that came along with them, and moves them; or, because they being lodged together in the Brain, that Word or Sound, or some other Vehement Motion of ours, <hi>excites</hi> again the same <hi>Phantasm</hi> which puts them upon acting. Nor can we draw any parallel from some wild and Savage <hi>Men,</hi> seeming as rude as <hi>Brutes;</hi> the Question is of their <hi>Nature,</hi> not of their <hi>Circumstances.</hi> Could it be well proved that those Brutish Savages, tho' instructed afterwards, could never be brought to perfom any actions more rationally than <hi>Brutes</hi> do, nor could ever be taught any Language to a tolerable degree, so as to answer at all <hi>Pertinently</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligently,</hi> the difficulty would be greater? But this I never heard, or read, asserted by any. Or, conld it be well attested, that <hi>Brutes</hi> could fancy, or make choise of a Female for being more <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful,</hi> or were taken with the <hi>Harmony</hi> of Musick, or did comport themselves accordingly, I must confess I should much wonder. I remember that about the year 1663. visiting my Noble Friend Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> he told me he was much sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95549:35"/>
and uneasy at a Relation made him by a Gentleman, whom he could not suspect guilty of that Vanity, as to tell an untruth to make his Story admired; which was, that he saw Apes dance the Ropes at <hi>Southwark Fair</hi> (which was then held) and that they framed their Gestures and Motions exactly according to the Musick. For (says he) this, if true, shows they know <hi>Proportion,</hi> which argues <hi>Reason,</hi> and will oblige us to seek for new Principles. At his earnest intreaty I went to examine the business, and found it thus. A fellow stood below on the ground with a String (which was put about the Ape's Neck) in one hand, and a Switch in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; who, understanding the Musick, made a little twitch with the String, or a menace with the Switch, when he would have the Ape retire, or advance, to keep time with the Fiddles: Nay, far were those Mock-men, the poor Apes, from being guilty of any thing that Resembled <hi>Reason,</hi> that, when they made them dance with a lighted Wax-candle in their hand, neither their Tutor's Instructions, nor their own Docility could teach them to hold the lighted end of the Candle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, though they often felt the inconvenience: for, the melted Wax scalded their Legs, and made them, in the middle of their dance, steal now and then a little Scratch where it burnt them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they did with such a Serious and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent grace, that it gave much divertisement to the Spectators. This Story I relate the more willingly, to warn others not to give easy credit to particular Men's Narrations, whether Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, or others; much less to suspect their own <hi>Principles</hi> upon such Sleight Advertisements. I
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95549:36"/>
returned to my Friend, and eased him of his Quandary; for which he was very thankful; and blamed himself much for giving credit to a Tale, to the prejudice of Evident <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. To proceed, and pursue my Theme more closely, I would be glad to know, at least in Common, what kind <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ideas,</hi> if not Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Notions,</hi> Inexplicable.</note> of things, in this Author's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, those <hi>[Ideas]</hi> are. Are they <hi>Corporeal,</hi> or are they <hi>Spiritual,</hi> or under what Head shall we rank them? If <hi>Corporeal,</hi> they cannot be in the Mind; as Accidents, or Modes of <hi>it;</hi> the Mind being of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> nature. If they be <hi>Spiritual,</hi> Brutes, which have not a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Nature, can have no <hi>Ideas.</hi> Perhaps it will be answer'd they are not <hi>things,</hi> but certain Modes of things: But this satisfies not; for Modes are Affections of the Thing, or certain <hi>Manners</hi> how it is; wherefore they must be sutable to the Nature of the Thing of which they are Modes; for a Thing <hi>cannot be such as it cannot bee:</hi> And so the question returns, what that <hi>Thing</hi> is of which those <hi>Ideas</hi> are the Modes: Is it Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, or is it Spiritual? If it be Spiritual, then again Brutes can have no <hi>Ideas,</hi> because they have no Spiritual <hi>Natures</hi> in them, and so they can have no Spiritual Modes: If <hi>Corporeal,</hi> then our Mind, which is Spiritual, can have no <hi>Ideas</hi> in it; Corporeal <hi>Ideas</hi> being improper Modes for a Spiritual Nature. I do chiefly insist upon this Objection, to shew more manifestly that the Word <hi>Idea,</hi> should have been Distinguish'd at first, and <hi>Counterposed</hi> to <hi>Phantasm,</hi> and not <hi>confounded</hi> with it: Besides, my Genius leads me when I discourse about any thing, even tho' I oppose it, to know distinctly <hi>what</hi> that thing is, least I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95549:36"/>
oppose I know not what; and I must declare that I can make no conception of the word <hi>Idea</hi> by what our Moderns, and particularly this Learned Author, has given me concerning it. For, he abstracts from affording his Reader a <hi>distinct</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> view of it; without which his Book, which runs wholly upon that Word, cannot be perfectly intelligible; nor, oftentimes, his main Discourses inferr any <hi>determinate</hi> Conclusions.</p>
               <p n="14">14. It may perhaps be replied, That every Man experiences he <hi>has</hi> those <hi>Ideas;</hi> as also that he comes to <hi>know,</hi> by <note place="margin">Experience that we have <hi>Ideas,</hi> gives no distinct Account <hi>what</hi> they are.</note> having them in his Mind; and therefore it is a folly to enquire so scrupulously about such things as are, in some sort, <hi>Self-known;</hi> and that it is enough to say they are <hi>Resemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of things, made in us by the Object without us. To which I reply, that we indeed experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the <hi>An est</hi> of something in our <hi>Mind</hi> (and, by the way, of something of another nature in our <hi>Fancy</hi> too) by which we know things; but, whether it ought to be called an <hi>[Idea]</hi> or suits with the proper meaning of this word; or, after it <hi>is</hi> called so, the <hi>Quid est</hi> of that <hi>[Idea]</hi> or what it is (at least as to the Common Notion or <hi>Genus</hi> of it) or what to make of it by the light yet given me by this Author, or any other I have had the good fortune to see, I must profess I am not able to discern. All the knowledge I have of it from him, besides that given above which confounds me, is this, That he calls it frequently a <hi>Resemblance,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">N<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Portraiture, Image, Appearanc,</hi> and such like; which still leave
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95549:37"/>
me more dissatisfied than ever: For, who can have the <hi>first</hi> knowledge of a thing by a <hi>Picture,</hi> or <hi>Resemblance</hi> of it? Let any Man see the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of a Tree, or an Apple, who <hi>had</hi> never seen those things themselves, nor ever <hi>should</hi> see them any <hi>other</hi> ways; and what knowledge could it give him, but only of things of a far different nature from a Tree, or Apple, <hi>viz.</hi> a Cloth, Board, or Paper, thus figured and colour'd? Or, how can any Man know that such things <hi>are,</hi> or have any being <hi>in nature,</hi> by a bare similitude of them. I may see the picture of such a shap'd <hi>Man,</hi> but whether that Man <hi>is,</hi> or ever <hi>was,</hi> the picture cannot inform me; so that it might be some Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Painter, for ought I know by the Picture. Indeed, had I known such things <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,</hi> then a Resemblance of them might, in that case, revive, and call into my mind the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them; but, how it should beget the <hi>first</hi> knowledge of them, as our late Philosophers put those <hi>Resemblances</hi> to do, is altogether impossible and inexplicable.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Again, since Mr. <hi>L.</hi> affirms that we know nothing, either by Direct or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex Knowledges, but by having <note place="margin">To have <hi>Ideas</hi> of our own <hi>Ideas,</hi> inexplicable.</note> 
                  <hi>Ideas</hi> of it; it must follow, that when by a Reflex Act I know my <hi>first Idea</hi> got by a <hi>direct</hi> Impression, I must have an <hi>Idea</hi> of that Direct <hi>Idea,</hi> and another <hi>Idea</hi> when I know that Reflex one, of <hi>it;</hi> and still ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>that;</hi> and so still on, all the time while I go on reflecting upon my former Knowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Now, what sense can we make of an <hi>Idea</hi> of an <hi>Idea,</hi> or what means a <hi>Similitude</hi> of a <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude,</hi> or an <hi>Image</hi> of an <hi>Image?</hi> Each succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95549:37"/>
Knowledge must be different from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, because it has still a different <hi>Object</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present, and that Object cannot be known with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its proper <hi>Idea;</hi> and, it is not only the immediately preceeding <hi>Act</hi> which must be thus different, but the immediately-preceding <hi>Idea</hi> too, which is the <hi>Object</hi> of each succeeding Act; And, in what shall we conceive the difference of those successive <hi>Ideas</hi> to consist? It may perhaps be said, that plain reason tells us it must be so, though we know not the particular manner <hi>how</hi> it is done. I answer, The same Reason tells us far more plainly, that it looks very untowardly, and aukwardly, it <hi>should</hi> be so; or that there should be a <hi>Resemblance of a Resemblance:</hi> And my advancing this Objection does oblige me to show, in due place, <hi>how</hi> both our Direct and Reflex Knowledges may be performed after a Connatural manner, without straining either good Sense, or the Nature of Things. Were it a <hi>Material</hi> Resemblance, it might, by rebounding from one place to another, cause a Resemblance of its self; but here 'tis quite otherwise; for the <hi>first (Idea)</hi> it coming by a Direct Impression from the Corporeal Object without me, must resemble <hi>It;</hi> and the <hi>Idea</hi> of that <hi>Idea</hi> (or else of my <hi>First</hi> Direct Act) which is the <hi>Object</hi> of my First <hi>Reflex Act,</hi> must be a Similitude of an <hi>Idea</hi> that came from the Object in Nature, and is like <hi>it;</hi> and the second Reflex <hi>Idea</hi> must resemble an <hi>Idea,</hi> which was like an <hi>Idea</hi> that represented a thing of a quite different, or of a Corporeal Nature; and so endwayes; which would put all our Reflex <hi>Ideas</hi> into Confusion, as involving still others in them.</p>

                  <p>FRom this whole Discourse collected into a Summary, I deduce this Corollary, that, since the word <hi>IDEA,</hi> according to this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, signifies a Resemblance, <hi>Similitude,</hi> or Image, and, consequently is indifferent to <hi>Corporeal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Resemblances, that is, to what's in the <hi>Mind,</hi> and what's only in the <hi>Fancy;</hi> and that, only that which is in the <hi>Mind</hi> can be the proper Material of all our <hi>Knowledges;</hi> hence that word is most improper to be used in Philosophy, which is the <hi>Study of Knowledge.</hi> Also, that as taken <hi>thus undistinguisht,</hi> it does in another regard high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prejudice all true <hi>Knowledge of Things,</hi> or <hi>Science;</hi> in regard it confounds <hi>Corporeal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Natures, which contain the two Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Objects of all our Knowledges; and are, besides, <hi>most vastly disparate.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>That the Elements, or Materials, of all our Knowledges are properly to be called. <hi>NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINOS;</hi> and <hi>what</hi> those <hi>Notions</hi> are.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">1. BUT, if the word <hi>[IDEA]</hi> be Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Improper to be used in Philosophy, as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit <note place="margin">That the Elements or Materials of our Knowledges are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to be called [NOTIONS.]</note> to signify the first Conceptions of our Mind, (which are, as Mr. <hi>L.</hi> says well, the <hi>Materials</hi> of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) and consequently, are apt to make us entertain <hi>Erroneous Fancies</hi> for <hi>Real Knowledges;</hi> it will be be ask'd what <hi>other</hi> word we can invent which is <hi>Univocal,</hi> Proper, and not liable to signify a <hi>Superficial Resemblance,</hi> nor dangerous to seduce us by taking <hi>Fantastical Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances</hi> for the true <hi>Knowledge of the Things;</hi> but is, of its own Nature, fit to express distinctly those Solid Materials, by the Composition of which the Structure of <hi>Science</hi> is to be raised? I reply, the word <hi>[Notions]</hi> is <hi>such,</hi> and answers all these Intentions; and therefore this is the <hi>only</hi> word to be made use of by Philosophers, who serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sincerely pursue the <hi>Knowledge of Things,</hi> and not their own witty Conceits, or <hi>Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Univocal</hi> and Unambiguous, because Men of Art, or Philosophers, who are the best
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95549:39"/>
Reflecters on the Operations of our Mind, and have the truest Right to express those Thoughts their Art has given them, have constantly used it hitherto to signify our <hi>simple Apprehensions,</hi> or the first Operation of our Understanding; and <hi>never</hi> to signify Material Resemblances, or <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasms:</hi> Whence also it claims to be <hi>Proper.</hi> And, indeed, it has title to be such even from its very <hi>Origin</hi> and <hi>Derivation:</hi> For, none can doubt, or ever question'd, but that the <hi>Compound</hi> word <hi>[Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition]</hi> does properly signify <hi>True [Knowledge,]</hi> and therefore the <hi>Simple</hi> word <hi>[Notion]</hi> must most properly signify those <hi>simple</hi> Parts, Elements, or Materials; the orderly putting together of which in a Knowing Power does compound, or make <hi>(Cognition,)</hi> Whereas the particular Sense or Meaning of the word <hi>[Idea]</hi> which denotes a Resemblance, or Similitude, does not, in its immediate and proper Sense, in the least inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate any Order to Knowledge <hi>at all;</hi> nor any Material, Part, or peculiar Object of it. Nor, lastly, does the word <hi>[Notion]</hi> signify a bare Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, or Resemblance, which can be, and usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is, in the Fancy; but (as will be seen short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) the <hi>very thing it self existing in our Mind;</hi> which is most undoubtedly a Solid Material, or Firm Ground to build the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Things,</hi> or Science upon it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I hope I shall have candid Readers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am not apprehensive that any will be so captious as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <note place="margin">The word <hi>[Notion]</hi> and <hi>[Cognition]</hi> are taken here <hi>Objectively.</hi>
                  </note> that I do here use an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal word, as well as others, by taking <hi>[Cognition]</hi> which signifies an <hi>Act</hi> of Knowledge, for the <hi>Object</hi> of that Act.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95549:40"/>
'Tis a Fate, to which all words are obnoxious, to have <hi>some</hi> Ambiguity, or double sense one way or other. Thus we call in our common Speech a Parchment by which we hold our Estates <hi>[A Writing,]</hi> and a Sentence of <hi>Seneca,</hi> his, <hi>[Saying];</hi> and so take those words for the thing <hi>Written,</hi> or <hi>Said;</hi> tho' they may also signifiy the <hi>Acts</hi> of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or saying. But, this is not such an Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calness as breaks squares between me and the <hi>Ideists,</hi> or that on which my Exception proceeds. The Univocalness which I assert to the word <hi>[Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition]</hi> and <hi>[Notion]</hi> is such a one as is taken from their <hi>Radix, [Nosco]</hi> which, notwithstanding little Gramatical variations, does still import some <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or an Order to it; and the genuin signification of those words, thus varied or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, is still kept within that same Line. Quite otherwise than is found in the word <hi>[IDEA]</hi> which is <hi>Indeterminate</hi> to those vastly different Lines of <hi>Corporeal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> (which makes it highly Equivocal;) besides that it has no Rapport at all to the Line of <hi>Knowledge</hi> from its <hi>Radix,</hi> or Original Sense. To clear then the meaning of the word <hi>[Notion,]</hi> as 'tis used here from this <hi>Sleight,</hi> and (in our case) <hi>Unconcerning</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity, I declare, that, there being two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations in <hi>Knowledge, viz.</hi> the <hi>Act</hi> of my Knowing Power, and the <hi>Object</hi> of that Act, which, as a kind of <hi>Form,</hi> actuates and determins the Indifferency of my Power, and thence specifies my Act; I do not here take the word <hi>[Notion]</hi> for my <hi>Act</hi> of Simply Apprehending; but for that <hi>Object</hi> in my mind which <hi>informs</hi> my Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power, and about which that Power is Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; in which <hi>Objective</hi> meaning I perceive
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95549:40"/>
Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> does also generally take the word <hi>[IDEA.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Since I have formerly blamed the Ambiguous explication of the word <hi>[IDEA,]</hi> 'tis but just it should be required <note place="margin">What <hi>Notions</hi> are.</note> of me to give a more Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and Distinct one of the word <hi>[Notion,]</hi> which I shall do in blunt Terms thus; <hi>[A Notion is the very thing it self existing in my understanding.]</hi> I expect at the first hearing such a monstrous Position, which seems to the Antiperipateticks something above Paradox, and as Mysterious as a Supernatural Point of Revealed Faith, it will be entertained by some of them with a kind of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, by others with a Smile. On the other side, I am so little concerned how any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, that I must resolutely declare that, unless this <hi>Thesis</hi> be as <hi>True</hi> as it is <hi>Strange,</hi> it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble any Man living should <hi>know any thing at all.</hi> By which the Reader will see that the Credits of the <hi>Aristotelians,</hi> and their Adversaries, as to their being held <hi>Solid Philosophers,</hi> does entirely lie at Stake upon the decision of this main point.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Er'e I address my self to prove my Position, I must bespeak my Reader's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, that, in a Question of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fancy</hi> is to have no hand in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing about <hi>Spiritual</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</note> this Nature, which depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Reflexion on what is, or is not in our <hi>Spiritual</hi> part, the the <hi>Soul,</hi> he must lay aside his pleasing <hi>Phantasms,</hi> and all the <hi>Imagery,</hi> which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95549:41"/>
with such a fine <hi>Raree-show</hi> uses to entertain and delight his <hi>Fancy.</hi> The point is of a <hi>higher</hi> Nature than to managed by such <hi>Familiar Appearances.</hi> The <hi>Ideas</hi> of Figure, Colour, nay, of Quantity it self must sit out as Bunglers, when such a Game is to be played, in which they have no Skill. This Contest must be carried on by <hi>Means</hi> as <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> as is the <hi>Subject</hi> of it; that is, by <hi>exact Reason,</hi> or severe <hi>Connexion of Terms.</hi> And, to think to draw Intrinsecal Arguments; or to frame pertinent Answers to them, from what we find in <hi>Material</hi> Imaginations, when the Question belongs to that part of Metaphysicks which treats of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Natures, and their Operations, is as absurd, as 'tis to contend that the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of a Man is <hi>Great,</hi> or <hi>Little,</hi> because his Body is <hi>Bigg,</hi> or <hi>Dwarfish;</hi> or to fancy that <hi>Science</hi> is to be measured by <hi>Yards,</hi> or <hi>Inches.</hi> And, tho' I cannot fear any such Rational kind of attacque as <hi>Close Connexion of Terms,</hi> for the Negative, yet I grant my self obliged to produce no less than Clearest Evidence for the Affirmative; provided we rate Evidence, not from what seems easiest to <hi>Fancy,</hi> but from the said <hi>Connexion of Terms;</hi> only which can <hi>establish</hi> our <hi>Judgments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. I am to note first, that, as the Moderns grant we know nothing without having <hi>[Ideas]</hi> of them <hi>within</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Question about <hi>Notions</hi> Stated.</note> 
                  <hi>our minds;</hi> so I willingly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that we cannot know any thing that is <hi>without us,</hi> but by having in our understanding <hi>Notions</hi> of those things. Now, say I, those <hi>Notions</hi> must be the <hi>very things</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>(as far</hi> as they are known) <hi>in our Soul;</hi> which they deny, as incredible and Monstrous.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95549:41"/>
I note, secondly, that in my <hi>Thesis,</hi> I take the word <hi>[Thing]</hi> in the largest Signification, as it comprehends not only <hi>Substances,</hi> which only are properly <hi>Things;</hi> but also all the <hi>Modes,</hi> or <hi>Accidents</hi> of Substance, which are improperly such. These Notes premised, I come to my Proof:</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>First Argument.</hi> When I <hi>simply apprehend</hi> the Thing, or any Mode or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident of it, this <hi>Operation</hi> of my <note place="margin">
                     <hi>A</hi> Notion <hi>is the</hi> Thing it self in our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; Proof 1. <hi>Because</hi> Knowing <hi>is an</hi> Immanent <hi>Act.</hi>
                  </note> Understanding is <hi>within</hi> my Mind, and compleated <hi>there;</hi> therefore the Thing Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, which is the <hi>Object</hi> of that Operation, must be <hi>there</hi> likewife: For, otherwise, this Operation of my Mind, it being Immanent, and not Transient, or passing <hi>out of</hi> my Mind to the Thing <hi>without me,</hi> cannot be employed about <hi>that Thing,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Supposition. Nor could the Thing be truly said to be <hi>Apprehended,</hi> unless this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, called my Apprehension, had the <hi>Thing</hi> for its <hi>Object;</hi> and this <hi>within</hi> my Understanding, it being an <hi>Internal Operation.</hi> But, that which is <hi>within</hi> me when I know it, is the <hi>Notion</hi> of it: Therefore the <hi>Notion</hi> of it (taken, as is declar'd above, objectively) is <hi>the Thing it self in my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Second Argument.</hi> I know the <hi>very Thing;</hi> therefore the very Thing is in my <hi>Act</hi> of Knowledge: But my Act <note place="margin">Proof 2. <hi>Because the</hi> Thing Known <hi>must be</hi> in <hi>our</hi> Knowing Power.</note> of Knowledge is <hi>in</hi> my <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;</hi> therefore the <hi>Thing</hi> which is <hi>in</hi> my Knowledge, is also <hi>in</hi> my Understanding.</p>

                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:95549:42"/>
8. Tho' I will not allow it to be any way an an Answer to these Arguments, to alledge, that 'tis sufficient that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Proof</hi> 3. Because a <hi>Resemblance</hi> is not the <hi>Object</hi> of Knowledge, nor sufficient to cause it.</note> the <hi>[Idea]</hi> or Resemblance of the Thing be in my Mind, because it does not in the least shock the Connexion of its Terms, or shew them Incoherent; but is a mere shuffling Pretence, thrown in to avoid their Force: Yet I shall condescend to shew it impertinent, and I argue against it thus.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Third Argument.</hi> That only is Known, which I have <hi>in</hi> my Knowledge, or <hi>in</hi> my Understanding; for, to know <note place="margin">Otherwise, <hi>Ideas</hi> only could be said to be <hi>known.</hi>
                  </note> what I <hi>have not in</hi> my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is a Contradiction: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if I have <hi>only</hi> the <hi>Idea,</hi> and not <hi>the Thing,</hi> in my Knowledge or Understanding, I can only know the <hi>Idea,</hi> and <hi>not the Thing;</hi> and, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, I know nothing <hi>without me,</hi> or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Nature.

               <p n="10">10. <hi>Fourth Argument.</hi> Philosophy is the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Things:</hi> But if I have nothing but the <hi>Ideas</hi> of Things <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Proof 4.</hi> Because, otherwise, all Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy would be destroy'd.</note> in my Mind, I can have Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of nothing but of those <hi>Ideas.</hi> Wherefore, either those Ideas <hi>are</hi> the <hi>Things themselves,</hi> as I put <hi>Notions</hi> to be, and then I have gain'd my Point; or else they are <hi>not</hi> the Things, and then we do <hi>not</hi> know the <hi>Things</hi> at all; and so adieu to the <hi>Knowledge of Things,</hi> or to Philosophy.</p>

11. I expect not any direct Answer to these Reasons, yet I doubt not but Wit and Fancy will furnish a prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Proof 5.</hi> Because <hi>Similitudes</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly give us the <hi>First</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Things.</hi>
                  </note> Person with Evasions; and the <hi>next</hi> will, possibly, be this, that we know the Things that are <hi>without us,</hi> by <hi>means</hi> of the <hi>Ideas</hi> or Resemblances of them which are <hi>within us.</hi> To overthrow which Pretence, I argue thus:</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Fifth Argument.</hi> We cannot have the <hi>First</hi> Knowledge of any thing by a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, or Resemblance, as was <note place="margin">As was prov'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</note> shewn, <hi>Preliminary</hi> 1. §. 14. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Notions, or Simple Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions being the <hi>First</hi> Notifications of the Things to our Mind, we cannot know the Thing <hi>by their means,</hi> as is pretended, were they not <hi>more than Resemblances;</hi> that is, were they not the <hi>very Thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To overthrow this Pretence utterly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to uphold and fortifie this last Argument, I advance this:</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>Sixth Argument.</hi> We cannot possibly know at all the Things themselves by the <hi>Ideas,</hi> unless we know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Proof 6.</hi> Because, ere we can know the <hi>Idea</hi> resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the Thing <hi>right,</hi> both of them must be in the <hi>Mind,</hi> to be <hi>there</hi> Compar'd.</note> those <hi>Ideas</hi> are <hi>Right Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances</hi> of them. But we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know (by the Principles of the <hi>Ideists)</hi> that their <hi>Ideas</hi> are <hi>Right Resemblances</hi> of the <hi>Things;</hi> therefore we cannot possibly know at all the Things by their <hi>Ideas.</hi> The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor is proved thus; We cannot know any <hi>Idea</hi> to be a <hi>Right Resemblance</hi> of a Thing, (nor, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that any thing whatever <hi>resembles</hi> another
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95549:43"/>
                  <hi>rightly,)</hi> unless they be <hi>both</hi> of them <hi>in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring</hi> Power; that is, in our Understanding or Reason, and there view'd and <hi>compar'd together,</hi> that we may see whether the one <hi>does</hi> rightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the other, or <hi>no.</hi> But, this necessitates that the <hi>Thing it self,</hi> as well as the <hi>Idea,</hi> must be in the Understanding, which is directly contrary to their Principles; therefore by the Principles of the <hi>Ideists,</hi> we cannot possibly know that their <hi>Ideas</hi> are Right Resemblances of the Thing. Now, if the <hi>Thing it self</hi> be in the Understanding, there needs no <hi>Idea</hi> of it; for to be <hi>there,</hi> or to be <hi>in a knowing Power,</hi> is to be <hi>known.</hi> Again,</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>Seventh Argument.</hi> No Relation can be known without Knowing both the Correlates: Therefore no <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Proof</hi> 7. Because both the <hi>Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi> must be <hi>in</hi> the Understanding.</note>

I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that, however it may be pretended that what is meant <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately</hi> by the words, is our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> when our <hi>own Thoughts</hi> or Judgments about any matter, are the things desir'd to be known; yet, when the <hi>Things</hi> are the Objects enquired after, as, when a Master teaches a Scholler <hi>Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,</hi> or any other <hi>Truth,</hi> the Intention of the Speakers does primarily <hi>aym</hi> and <hi>mean</hi> to signify the <hi>Things</hi> or <hi>Truths themselves;</hi> and not <hi>our Thoughts</hi> concerning them; and, therefore, the <hi>Things themselves</hi> are in the <hi>Intention</hi> and <hi>Mind,</hi> or are the <hi>Meanings</hi> of the Speakers, or Discoursers. And this passes generally in all other occasions, except only when the Knowledge of our Interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Thoughts is ultimately aymed at. Thus, when a Gentleman bids his Servant fetch him a Pint of Wine; he does not mean to bid him fetch the <hi>Idea</hi> of Wine in his own head, but the Wine it self which is in the Cellar; and the same holds in all our Commerce and Conversation about things without us.</p>

17. <hi>Eleventh Argument.</hi> Our Words are <hi>ad placi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and have no <hi>Natural</hi> Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion with the Things they signifie, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Proof 11.</hi> Because the <hi>Ideas</hi> cannot be <hi>fore-known</hi> to our Agreement what VVords are to signifie, but the <hi>Things</hi> only.</note> but are order'd to express them by the <hi>Agreement</hi> of Mankind: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what's signified by them, must be <hi>fore-known</hi> to that Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But the <hi>Ideas,</hi> or Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances we have, cannot be <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known</hi> to this Agreement, since they could not be at all known, (being <hi>in the Mind,)</hi> but by the <hi>Words;</hi> which, not being yet agreed on, can make known, or signifie nothing. Therefore the <hi>Things</hi> which we had naturally <hi>Fore-knowledge</hi> of, and not the <hi>Ideas,</hi> are that which is signified by <hi>Words.</hi> On the other side, since 'tis no less cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Words do signifie what's <hi>in the Mind</hi> of the Speaker, or his <hi>Notions,</hi> they must signifie <hi>the Thing in the Mind;</hi> and, consequently, also the <hi>very Things</hi> which are <hi>without us,</hi> and which were known to us <hi>before</hi> the Agreement about the Words, were in our Mind, when we went about to <hi>name</hi> them: And, were not this so, Words could signifie <hi>nothing,</hi> which is a Contradiction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corollary</hi> I. Hence that great Contest in the Schools, whether our Words do <hi>immediately</hi> signifie our <hi>Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hence the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, VVhether the <hi>Things,</hi> or our Notions, are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by VVords, is Frivolous.</note> or the Things <hi>in re,</hi> (as they phrase it,) is put past all Dispute. For, if the <hi>Objective</hi> Part of our Conceptions, which are our <hi>Notions</hi> of the Thing, be the <hi>self-same</hi> with the Thing <hi>in re,</hi> neither the <hi>one,</hi> nor the <hi>other,</hi> is immediately sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95549:44"/>
because there is no <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>other,</hi> but the <hi>same.</hi> And if the Question be put of the Thing <hi>as in re,</hi> and <hi>as in the Understanding;</hi> 'tis answer'd, This Question takes in those several <hi>Manners of Existing,</hi> which enters not into the Objective No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor prejudices the <hi>Identity</hi> of the Thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>either</hi> State; and so the Question is again fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>Twelfth Argument.</hi> The same is evinced from the <hi>Verification</hi> of our Words; as, when I say <hi>[The Glass is in the</hi>

                  </note> may be drawn from those very Words which themselves do most affect. They hold, the <hi>Idea,</hi> or <hi>Likeness</hi> of the Thing is in the Mind. Let us consider then the Likeness of a <hi>Man</hi> in the Understanding; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because we both agree that we have no <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Ideas</hi> or Notions of any <hi>Suppositum,</hi> let us take one of Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Simple <hi>Ideas,</hi> v. g. <hi>Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.

we can discourse of it as a <hi>Simple Idea.</hi> And, if it is <hi>perfectly,</hi> or in <hi>all</hi> respects, like it; then 'tis <hi>in no Respect unlike it;</hi> and, by Consequence, <hi>in no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect Different from it,</hi> (for that <hi>Difference</hi> would be an <hi>Unlikeness;)</hi> and, if it be <hi>in no respect Different,</hi> it follows, out of the very Terms, that it is the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same, in</hi> the Mind, and <hi>out of</hi> the Mind, which is so much boggled at in our <hi>Notions:</hi> So that, at unawares, the Explicaters of <hi>Ideas</hi> by <hi>Resemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> must be forced to come over to our Position, even while they would avoid it.</p>
               <p n="20">20. <hi>Fourteenth Argument.</hi> To make this yet Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to set it above all possible Confute, let us take the Word, <note place="margin">

Wherefore, to put them out of this Mis-conceit, we will endeavour to convince them that this Position is not a Trick of <hi>Art,</hi> but plain honest <hi>Nature:</hi> It has been still my usual Method to shew, that the highest Speculations I advance, are abetted by the <hi>natural</hi> Notions, Sentiments, and Sayings of <hi>Mankind;</hi> nor will I decline to bring my present Position to be tried by the same Test. Let us take then two <hi>Quantities,</hi> (Yards for Example;) in case we find them <hi>perfectly Alike</hi> under the Notion or Respect of <hi>Quantity,</hi> we make account we can in true Speech say they are the <hi>same Quantity.</hi> Or, take two Pieces of Cloth, of such a Colour; and, if they be <hi>exactly alike</hi> in that respect, unprejudiced Nature obliges us to say they are <hi>of the same Colour;</hi> and the same holds in all Substances and Modes whatever. Since then the <hi>Ideists</hi> must grant that their <hi>Ideas</hi> are <hi>perfectly like</hi> that which they know by them, (as they must be, as <hi>far</hi> as the Thing is <hi>known</hi> by them, because the Thing is known <hi>only</hi> by their Resembling, or being <hi>like it,)</hi> it follows from the Consent of Mankind, that those <hi>Ideas</hi> must, consequently, be the <hi>same</hi> with the <hi>Things out of the Mind</hi> which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95549:46"/>
are known by them; which is what we put our Notions to be. Wherefore, the <hi>Notion</hi> we have of the <hi>Thing,</hi> must be the <hi>self-same</hi> with the <hi>Thing known.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22.

That no created <hi>Thing,</hi> nor consequently, <hi>Mode</hi> or <hi>Accident</hi> of it, has, of its own Nature, any Title <hi>to be at all,</hi> (much less to be after <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such a Manner;)</hi> for then <hi>Being</hi> would be <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential</hi> to them, and not the Gift of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; whose Prerogative of <hi>Self-being,</hi> or <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Being,</hi> is Incommunicable to his Creatures. 2.

               <p n="25">25. <hi>Corollary</hi> II. From this whole discourse, and the many several Arguments in it, it appears evidently, that <note place="margin">No <hi>Solid Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> can be built on <hi>Ideas.</hi>
                  </note> unless the word <hi>[Idea]</hi> be taken as we take the word <hi>[Notion,]</hi> that is, unless <hi>Ideas,</hi> or <hi>Notions,</hi> or whatever else we please to call them, be the <hi>very things</hi> in <hi>our understanding,</hi> and not meer <hi>Resemblances</hi> of them, they can never reach or engage the Thing <hi>it self,</hi> or give us <hi>Knowledge</hi> of it; that is, they can never make us <hi>know any thing;</hi> any more than a Picture can make us <hi>know</hi> a Man we never <hi>saw,</hi> nor ever <hi>shall</hi> or <hi>can see</hi> but by means of that Picture; that is, <hi>not at all.</hi> And therefore, as I cannot but <hi>judge</hi> what I here advance to be <hi>True,</hi> and withall most necessary to be told, so I am obliged, without asking leave of any, to do that Right to Truth as to <hi>declare</hi> that those many Schems of Doctrine, woven upon such <hi>Ideas</hi> as their Groundwork, tho' they be never so Ingenious and coherent within themselves, and may be of some use in Logick to distinguish our Notions, are both meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Superficial, and perfectly useless in Philosophy,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95549:48"/>
which is the <hi>Knowledge of Things;</hi> and can only serve to please the Daedalean Fancies of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Contrivers and witty Descanters upon them; but can never bring us to the Solid <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of <hi>any one Thing</hi> in Nature, nor verify <hi>any one</hi> Predication, or Judgment we make; nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us in our Speculative, or even Common, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses about <hi>any Thing,</hi> to speak one word of good Sense. Not that I think that Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> does still take the word <hi>[Idea]</hi> in that unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable meaning; but, that the acuteness of his Natural <hi>Genius</hi> does generally carry him (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps unreflectingly) to mean by that word the same I mean by <hi>Notion;</hi> tho', to say the truth, he totally abstracts from meddling designedly with this abstruse point.</p>
               <p n="26">26. <hi>Corollary</hi> III. Hence also we may gain some light what <hi>Knowledge</hi> is. For, it has been demonstrated that our <note place="margin">1. VVhat <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> is.</note> 
                  <hi>Notions,</hi> on which all our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges are grounded, and of which they are Compounded, are the very <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> of the thing <hi>known;</hi> and, consequently, that our Soul, considered precisely <hi>as knowing</hi> those Natures, or having them <hi>in her,</hi> as in their Subject, <hi>is,</hi> as <hi>such,</hi> those very <hi>Things</hi> which are constituted by those Natures. Wherefore, our knowing that those things <hi>are,</hi> or are <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such</hi> (which is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Knowledge) is the <hi>having</hi> those things and their Predicates of <hi>Existent,</hi> or of their being affected with <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such</hi> Accidents, <hi>so</hi> in the Judging Power <hi>as</hi> they are in the things <hi>without;</hi> that is, the things <hi>within her</hi> must <hi>be</hi> as the things in Nature <hi>are.</hi> Wherefore, when the Soul knows any thing in Nature she must <hi>be</hi> that thing <hi>as it</hi>

               <p n="2">2. To clear this important Difficulty, on which the whole Affair of <hi>Science,</hi> and the Confutation of Scepticism, <note place="margin">Some Notes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to clear this Objection.</note> seems mainly to depend, it is to be noted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. First, That the Notion of the <hi>Individuum,</hi> Thing or <hi>Suppositum,</hi> can never, for the Reason now given, be <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Our <hi>Knowledge</hi> is such as our <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are.</note> and <hi>Compleat,</hi> but Confused and Imperfect. For, let us take
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95549:50"/>
any Individual thing, <hi>v. g.</hi> a Stone, we shall find that it has in it what answers to the Notion of a <hi>Thing,</hi> (or what <hi>has Being)</hi> as also of <hi>Extended, Dense, Hard, Opacous, Dinted,</hi> &amp;c. it is <hi>Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> into innumerable Particles; its peculiar <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> consists of many <hi>diverse-natured Parts,</hi> with such an <hi>Order or Position</hi> amongst them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of all which our Senses, with their best Assistances, can not afford us clear Knowledge; nor, consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, imprint any <hi>Clear Notion</hi> of that <hi>whole</hi> Thing in our Mind.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Secondly, That, since to <hi>know</hi> a Thing, is to have the Notion of it in our Mind, our <hi>Knowledge</hi> must be <hi>such</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">We can have such a Notion of a <hi>Thing</hi> (or Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence) as distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes it from <hi>all other things.</hi>
                  </note> as the <hi>Notion</hi> is: If the Notion be <hi>Clear, Intire</hi> and <hi>Distinct,</hi> our Knowledge too is <hi>such;</hi> and, if the Notion be <hi>Obscure, Partial</hi> and <hi>Confused,</hi> our Knowledge must be Obscure, Partial, and Confused like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Thirdly, We can have such a Notion of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Individual thing, if it be not (as the smallest Atoms are) too <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Confused</hi> Notions suffice for a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote</hi> Ground of <hi>Science.</hi>
                  </note> little to be perceptible by our Sense, as (tho' it be Confused as to it self) may serve to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish it from all other <hi>Things,</hi> and to make us know it Exists separately from all others, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently on them; Moreover, that it is the <hi>Suppositum,</hi> or Subject, which has its <hi>own Nature or Essence</hi> in it, and also all the <hi>Modes</hi> or <hi>Accidents</hi> belonging to it. Thus, when we see a Bag of Sand, or Wheat, poured out, our Senses acquaint our Mind, pre-imbued by some common Notions,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95549:50"/>
that each Grain can exist separate; and <hi>has,</hi> su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stains, or gives Being to its <hi>own</hi> Accidents, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Assistance of any of its Fellow-Grains.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Fourthly, This Confused Knowledge of the Thing, in gross, is sufficient for such a Degree of Science of it, as <note place="margin">Only <hi>Distinct</hi> or <hi>Abstracted</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate</hi> Ground of Distinct Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or <hi>Science.</hi>
                  </note> we can have in this State. For tho' we cannot have a <hi>distinct Knowledge</hi> of it <hi>all,</hi> taken in the <hi>Lump,</hi> and therefore do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have Science of it <hi>thus considered,</hi> nor of each Considerability in it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Detail; yet, we know that Confusedly it <hi>contains</hi> in it self what answers to all the many <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi> Conceptions we make of it, which are the Ground of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Science</hi> we have; they being all stored up and amassed in the <hi>Thing,</hi> and apt to be drawn or parcell'd out thence by our <hi>Abstractive</hi> Considerations of it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Lastly,</hi> That our <hi>Distinct Knowledge</hi> (or <hi>Science)</hi> is built on our <hi>Distinct Notions</hi> of the Thing fram'd in <note place="margin">Science thus groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is truly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Thing.</hi>
                  </note> our Minds by Impressions on the Senses, which are <hi>many,</hi> and the Manners of their affecting us also <hi>manifold.</hi> Hence our Soul, in this State, can have no <hi>Distinct</hi> or Clear Knowledge of the <hi>Thing,</hi> but by <hi>piece-meal,</hi> or by Distinct, Different, Partial, Inadequate, or (as they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally and properly called) <hi>Abstract Notions;</hi> as Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> has frequently and judiciously exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify'd in the several Conceptions or Notions we have of <hi>Gold;</hi> which we may consider, as yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, heavy, solid, malleable, dissolvable in <hi>aqua Regia, &amp;c.</hi> Whence, tho' it be, perhaps, impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95549:51"/>
for us to reach all the Considerabilities that may be found in it, which ground our Different Notions; yet each Notion we have of it, being Distinct from all the rest, and being truly <hi>the Thing, as far as 'tis thus Consider'd;</hi> hence we can have <hi>Science</hi> of the <hi>Thing,</hi> tho' confusedly of the <hi>whole,</hi> yet <hi>Distinctly</hi> of it <hi>in part,</hi> by such a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>as far</hi> as it is conceived by that Notion; notwithstanding our Ignorance of <hi>other</hi> Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of it; those Abstract Notions being in our Mind, (unless they hap to be Subordinate, as <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Particular</hi> ones are,) perfectly <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi> from, and <hi>Exclusive</hi> of one another. Thus we can have Abstract Notions of Length, Breadth and Thickness in Bodies; or (which is the same) we can conceive Bodies <hi>precisely</hi> as they are Long, Broad and Thick; and Mathematicians can frame many Sciences of Bodies, as <hi>thus conceived;</hi> and discourse Orderly and Clearly of each of those distinct Notions, that is, of the Thing, as <hi>precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such;</hi> without meddling with Rarity, Density, Solidity, Fluidity, Heat, Cold, Moisture, Dryness, or any other Physical Consideration found in the same Body: Tho' each of these last also may, for the same Reason, <hi>(viz.</hi> their <hi>Clear Distinction</hi> from all the rest,) be discours'd of with equally Clear Evidence; and ground as many several Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Sciences in Physick, as the other did in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks.</p>
               <p n="8">8. By what's said, it appears, that all Science, or all Philosophy, being ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on these Abstract or <hi>Distinct</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Abstracted <hi>Ideas,</hi> tho' <hi>Exclusive</hi> of one another, do <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude</hi> or conno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the <hi>Thing.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Notions of the Thing,</hi> it can be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said to be the <hi>Knowledge of Things;</hi> and that unless this be so,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95549:51"/>
there can be no Philosophy. This Position Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> has ingenuously asserted: Whether he holds to it exactly, or no, will be seen shortly. Tho', in case he should be found to deviate from it, 'tis not peculiar to him, but a far more Common Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in our Modern School-Philosophers; and, I fear, in <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Ideists:</hi> For these Gentlemen, as soon as they have got such <hi>Ideas</hi> into their Heads, and express'd them by <hi>Abstract</hi> Words, as Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, Extension, Roundness, Length, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they, finding this Abstract Conception in their Minds, and experiencing that they can discourse about it Scientifically, do presently begin to imagine that those <hi>Ideas</hi> have <hi>got rid</hi> of the <hi>Thing,</hi> and hover in the Air (as it were) <hi>a-loof</hi> from it, as a little sort of shining Entities; and thence have of <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> a Title to be a Competent <hi>Ground-work</hi> to build <hi>Science</hi> on. They Character them to be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances,</hi> which is a Conceit <hi>easie</hi> to Fancy; and so they set themselves to contemplate them, and employ their Wits to descant on them. They dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>them,</hi> and <hi>them only;</hi> for they do not endeavour to shew clearly how those <hi>Ideas</hi> do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the solid Nature of the Thing. Whence it must needs happen, that in case those <hi>Ideas</hi> chance to be meer <hi>Material</hi> Resemblances, or Phantasms, the Knowledge built on them is purely Superficial and Imaginary; nor can have any more TRUTH in it, than a Looking-glass, which represents to us a well-proportioned Edifice; or a Dream, which (as it sometimes lights) is composed of Fancies pretty well Coherent with one another. Lastly, which is worst of all, they make Truth, which can have no Foundation, but in the <hi>Things</hi> which Creative Wisdom or Essential Truth has
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95549:52"/>
made and establish'd, to consist in the meer Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those <hi>Ideas.</hi> Whereas they ought to make it consist in this, that those Abstracted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, or Notions of ours, are the <hi>Thing</hi> it self thus partially consider'd; and also, that our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Discourses of them, and all Truths what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, do wholly consist in this, that those Partial Conceptions of ours are found to be Identify'd in the <hi>Thing</hi> we Judge or Discourse of. 'Tis the Thing we <hi>divide,</hi> (as it were,) or take in pieces by those Abstract or Partial Notions of it; and, therefore, 'tis the Parts (as it were) of the same Thing we put together again, and Identify when we <hi>compound</hi> Propositions or Judgments.</p>
               <p n="9">9. In a word, They make the Abstractedness of those Ideas to be <hi>Exclusive</hi> of the <hi>Subject</hi> or <hi>Thing;</hi> whereas I <note place="margin">This Point farther explicated, and enforced.</note> make it only Exclusive of other <hi>Notions,</hi> but to <hi>Include</hi> and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Thing or Subject, according to some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, or (as it were) Part of it; in the same manner (to use a grosser Example) as the <hi>Hand</hi> or <hi>Foot</hi> signifie the <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Thing</hi> to which they belong, <hi>according to</hi> his Power of Handling, or Walking. Hence I hold, that Whiteness, Breadth or Hardness in the Wall, do signifie and import the <hi>Wall</hi> it self, precisely <hi>quatenus,</hi> or <hi>as it is</hi> White, Broad and Hard. Whence I affirm, that all <hi>Science,</hi> which consists of those <hi>Abstract and Mutually-distinct Notions,</hi> as of its Materials, is truly a <hi>Solid</hi> (tho' inadequate) Knowledge of those very Things; and not of Notions, or <hi>Ideas,</hi> aparted from them <hi>really,</hi> or as <hi>Distinct</hi> kinds of Beings Existing sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately from it: Which if they were, we should be never a Jot the wiser for knowing all the <hi>Ideas</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:95549:52"/>
in the World, nor ever arrive at true Philosophy, it being the Knowledge of <hi>Things,</hi> and not of <hi>Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances:</hi> Especially, since (as was demonstrated in my former Section) those Resemblances can never give us Knowledge of the <hi>Things themselves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may draw farther Arguments to prove our Position, that all our most Abstract Notions do <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude</hi> or <hi>connotate</hi> the Thing or Subject, from <hi>all</hi> our Abstract Notions or Ideas, whether they be Essential, or Accidental.

an <hi>Idea</hi> of it, which <hi>excludes</hi> Body, is to make it a Mode of <hi>Nothing,</hi> and consequently <hi>no Mode;</hi> which is to destroy the Notion of Space, while he goes about to refine it.

4. The Schoolmen, whose way it is, when they are at a Plunge how to find out a Reason for any difficult <note place="margin">How the <hi>Schools</hi> explicated this Point.</note> Point, to create some <hi>Entity</hi> which God and Nature never made, and then to alledge 'twas <hi>that Entity</hi> which did the business; invented their <hi>Species Intentiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les;</hi> which, if they were not the <hi>same</hi> with our <hi>Notions,</hi> or the <hi>Things</hi> in our Knowledge, were <hi>meer Resemblances</hi> coined by Fancy, as our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Ideas</hi> generally are. But this <hi>raised</hi> a new Difficulty, instead of <hi>laying</hi> the old one: For, besides that those <hi>Species</hi> were such unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, that none knew what to make of them, or under what Head to rank them, they could do the Question no Service at all: For, if they were <hi>Corporeal,</hi> they could only affect the Soul by way of <hi>Local Motion;</hi> of which, being <hi>Spiritual,</hi> she is not capable. And, if they were <hi>Spiritual,</hi> it will be ask'd, How they <hi>came</hi> to be such, being caused by a <hi>Corporeal</hi> Agent; as also, <hi>how,</hi> being sent from a <hi>Body,</hi> they could get into the Soul, or by what Vehicle? Being thus at a Loss, they invented another Entity, called <hi>Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus Agens;</hi> whose Office it was to depure the Phantasms from their Dross of Materiality, that they might become fit, thus refined, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in the Soul. But this still multiply'd more Difficulties, and solv'd none. For, <hi>First,</hi> What <hi>other</hi> Reason had they from Nature to put such a Power in the Soul? Or what <hi>other</hi> thing was it good for, but to purifie the <hi>Species?</hi> If it had <hi>no other</hi> Office, nor served for any thing but to do this Job, 'tis manifest 'twas invented <hi>gratis,</hi> to get rid of the Difficulty that stunn'd them, and taken
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95549:58"/>
up for an <hi>Asylum Ignorantiae,</hi> when they were hard put to it, and wanted something else to say. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Were those Phantasms, before they were Spiritualiz'd, <hi>in</hi> the Soul, or <hi>Intellectus,</hi> or <hi>out of it?</hi> If <hi>in it,</hi> the old Question returns, <hi>How got they thither?</hi> If <hi>out of it,</hi> How could the Soul's Acts of Understanding, which are <hi>Immanent</hi> Acts, become <hi>Transitive,</hi> and affect a Thing which is <hi>without her? Thirdly,</hi> Since the Understanding, or this <hi>Intellectus Agens,</hi> can only work by <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> how could it have this Power to alter the Natures of things, or turn them from Corporeal into Spiritual, when as yet it had <hi>no</hi> Knowledge at all <hi>in</hi> it, as before those <hi>Species</hi> were refined and fitted to be received in it, it had none? <hi>Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Are those <hi>Species</hi> they put, when purify'd, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly like</hi> the Thing, or <hi>imperfectly?</hi> If <hi>perfectly like,</hi> then they are the <hi>same</hi> with it, as our <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are; and so, the Thing it self is <hi>in the Soul,</hi> and then those <hi>Species</hi> of theirs are to no purpose; for the Thing being there in Person (as it were,) there can need no Proxy of <hi>Species</hi> to stand for it; nor can it bear any Sense to call the <hi>Thing</hi> a <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of it self. If they be <hi>imperfectly like</hi> the Thing, they are no more but <hi>Resemblances</hi> of it; and then, 'tis already abundantly demonstrated, that the Thing can <hi>never</hi> be known <hi>by them:</hi> So that they could make nothing cohere <hi>how</hi> our first Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments or Materials of Knowledge could <hi>get into</hi> the Soul, or how the Thing could come to be known <hi>by them.</hi>

The <hi>Cartesians</hi> tell us in one Word, That <hi>God</hi> gave the Soul her <hi>Ideas</hi> (or, as some of them say, <hi>some</hi> of them) at the same time he gave her her Being; and that, by having those <hi>Ideas</hi> in her, she comes to know; and, so, by making this quick work, the Question is at an End. This is soon <hi>said,</hi> but not so easily <hi>proved.</hi> Some Rubs I have put in the way of this Pretence, to hinder its Currency, in the Preface to my <hi>Method,</hi> and in the Book it self, as Occasion presented; and shall add many more, in case their Opposition shall invite me to it. But; what needs any more, since Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> has already Confuted that Position beyond possibility of any Rational Reply?

These Men do certainly act more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently than the former; for, 'tis much more wise and safe, in order to the Common Good of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to wave an obscure Point totally; than, by advancing false Positions, in a matter of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Concern in Philosophy, to affirm what cannot be maintain'd. Tho' I must declare, that I cannot see but that such a Fundamental Point, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences the whole Body of <hi>Science,</hi> ought not to be pretermitted. For which reason I have thought fit to lay the Grounds for it in the two first Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of my <hi>Method,</hi> reserving a more particular Account of it till further Occasion should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented; which seems to offer it self at present.</p>

comprehends <hi>all</hi> the best Perfections found in the whole Universality of Creatures, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <hi>more. Secondly,</hi> 'Tis yet harder to frame a Notion of a <hi>Being,</hi> in which those Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Perfections are not found <hi>Single,</hi> but are all of them <hi>center'd</hi> in <hi>one most Simple,</hi> and most Uncompounded <hi>Formality;</hi> which contains in it self eminently all the Excellencies that can possibly be conceived in Creatures, and Millions of times <hi>greater,</hi> and <hi>more. Thirdly,</hi> As we can have no <hi>Notion</hi> of a <hi>Created Spiritual</hi> Nature, but by a <hi>Negation</hi> of what's Proper to <hi>Body;</hi> so we can have no Notion of the <hi>Divine</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by <hi>Denying</hi> of him all that belongs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to the Natures of such a <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit both;</hi> and by acknowledging them infinitely short of resembling, or even shadowing him. <hi>Lastly,</hi> We have no <hi>Notion,</hi> or <hi>Expression,</hi> that can <hi>sute</hi> with him; no, not even the most Metaphysical ones. <hi>Ens</hi> includes <hi>Potentiality</hi> to Existence; and, all Potentiality signifying <hi>Imperfection,</hi> must be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>denied</hi> of him. <hi>Existence</hi> seems to come nearer; yet, because it signifies a Formality supervening to <hi>Ens,</hi> as 'tis <hi>Existent;</hi> and so is, as it were, a kind of <hi>Compart,</hi> it cannot be Proper for his infinitely-<hi>Simple</hi> Being. And even <hi>Self-existence</hi> signifies a kind of Form or Mode of the Subject <hi>that Self-exists.</hi> So that we have no kind of Notion or Expression, that can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agree to <hi>God</hi>'s Infinite Essence; but we are forc'd to content our selves to make use of sometimes <hi>one</hi> Attribute, sometimes <hi>another,</hi> that signifies some Perfection, with <hi>[Infinite]</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd to it, which is <hi>not found</hi> in Creatures, or which is <hi>denied</hi> of them, or is <hi>Incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:95549:72"/>
to them. Whence comes that Maxim of the Mysticks, that <hi>God is better known by Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,</hi> or by affirming he is <hi>none</hi> of those Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Perfections we find in Creatures, than by applying any of our <hi>Positive</hi> Notions to him. And this is all we can do in this State, till Grace raising us up to Glory, we come to know his Divine Essence, <hi>as it is in its Self;</hi> (or, as we phrase it, <hi>See him Face to Face;)</hi> in contemplating which, consists our Eternal Happiness.</p>
               <p n="40">40. Thus much of our Notions, which we call the <hi>First Operations</hi> of our Understanding, and how they <note place="margin">The Author speaks not here of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring</hi> Notions, or of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>

                  <hi>First,</hi> That he would not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject his own <hi>Fancies</hi> or <hi>Dis-like</hi> of it, or think that this is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to invalidate it; but, that he would go to work like a <hi>Man of Reason,</hi> and shew that This or That part of it does contradict Such and Such a <hi>Principle</hi> in Logick, Physicks, or Metaphysicks.

it is fundamentally necessary to Philosophy that this Point be clear'd,) that he would set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to frame some Orderly and Coherent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of his own, built upon Evident <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, how,</hi> or <hi>by what particular Means, the first Knowledge of the Things without us, comes into our Soul.</hi> In doing which, he will oblige the World very highly, and my self very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly: And, unless he does this, he will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced <hi>to find fault with what himself cannot mend:</hi> Which will manifest that he either wants <hi>true Knowledge,</hi> or (which is a far greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect) <hi>Ingenuity.</hi>

                  <hi>Method</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd of <hi>in common;</hi> and I have here in my Second Preliminary clear'd also <hi>in common</hi> the Signification of all <hi>Abstract</hi> Words, and shewn, that they mean the thing it self, <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus</hi> such or such; or, <hi>according</hi> to such or such a Consideration of it as is express'd by that Word. My present Business, to which my Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances oblige me, is to clear, <hi>in particular,</hi> the Notion or Meaning of those most Important Words, which being made use of by Learned Men, and taken by them often-times in different Senses, do so distract them in their Sentiments;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95549:74"/>
and, by drawing their Intellectual Eye, now to <hi>one</hi> side, now to the <hi>other,</hi> make them so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miss the Mark while they aim at true <hi>Science.</hi> Not that my Intention in this Preliminary is, to pursue the Mistakes of <hi>others,</hi> but only to settle the True and Genuine Sense of such Words, to be applied afterwards to the Mis-accepters of them, as occasion requires; tho' I may hint now and then some Abuses of them, that so I may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter clear their proper Signification.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I begin with <hi>[Existence]</hi> express'd by the Word <hi>[is]</hi> which is the Notion of the Thing, precisely consider'd <note place="margin">The Meaning of the word <hi>[Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence.]</hi>
                  </note> as it is <hi>Actually Being.</hi> This is the <hi>most simple</hi> of all our Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or rather indeed the <note n="*" place="margin">Method. 1. B. 1. L. 2. § 14.</note> 
                  <hi>only</hi> Simple Notion we have, all the rest being but <hi>Respects to it.</hi> For, it has no kind of Composition in it, not even that Metaphysical one, of grounding divers Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Considerations of it, as all others have. Whence all Notions being, by their Abstraction, <hi>Distinct</hi> and <hi>Clear;</hi> this <hi>most</hi> Abstracted Notion is so <hi>perfectly</hi> clear and self-evident, that, as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>need,</hi> so it cannot <hi>admit</hi> any Explication. They who go about to <hi>explain</hi> it, show themselves Bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, while they strive to approve themselves Artists. For, by telling us, that 'tis <hi>Esse contra Causas,</hi> they put <hi>[Esse,]</hi> which is the Notion defin'd, in the <hi>Definition;</hi> which is most absurd, and against all Art and Common Sense: Nay, they make it more obscure than it was before, by adding <hi>[Extra Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sas]</hi> to it, which are <hi>less clear</hi> than <hi>it self</hi> was. By the Word <hi>[Causes,]</hi> I suppose, they mean <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> ones; and so, tho' it gives no Clearness to the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95549:74"/>
Signification of the Word <hi>[Esse,]</hi> yet it may at least consist with good Sense; and may mean, that the Thing was, <hi>before,</hi> or while it was not yet produced, <hi>within the Power</hi> of those Causes, or in the State of <hi>Potentiality;</hi> and that <hi>Existence</hi> is that Formality, or most formal Conception, by which the Thing is put out of that imperfect State, of having only <hi>A Power to be,</hi> and is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the perfecter State of <hi>Actuality,</hi> or <hi>Actual Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. As it is impossible to misconceive this self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident Notion, so 'tis equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to mistake the meaning <note place="margin">The Extreme Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Misconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</note> of the word <hi>[Existence]</hi> which properly expresses that Notion; for, if they take the word <hi>[is]</hi> to have any meaning, relating any way to the Line of <hi>[Ens,]</hi> or any Signification at all that is, of its Nature, purely <hi>Potential,</hi> they quite destroy it's No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And, if they take it, in any Sense, for an Actuality <hi>not</hi> belonging to the Line of <hi>Ens,</hi> they must necessarily take it to mean <hi>[is not,]</hi> there being no <hi>Third</hi> or <hi>other</hi> such Notion to take it for; in the same manner, as if one takes not <hi>Ens</hi> to mean <hi>A Thing,</hi> he must take it to mean <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Now, tho' the Goodness of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which abhors Contradiction, reclaims ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently against such an unnatural Depravation of Common Sense, as to take <hi>[is,]</hi> while thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd, for <hi>[is not;]</hi> yet, taking the meaning of the Word <hi>[Existence]</hi> as it is <hi>disguised</hi> by <hi>another</hi> Word, which is, by consequence, <hi>Equivalent</hi> to it; those Deserters of Humane Nature, the <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> do take occasion from the altering the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, to misapprehend even what is <hi>Self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:95549:75"/>
For 'tis the same Sense, (when we speak affirmatively) to say a thing is <hi>True</hi> or <hi>Certain,</hi> as to say <hi>it is;</hi> since nothing can be <hi>True</hi> or <hi>Certain</hi> that <hi>is not;</hi> and, therefore, when these Men talk of <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Probable Truth,</hi> and <hi>Probable</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Certainty, which mincing Expressions mean <hi>[possible not to be so]</hi> they in effect say, that <hi>[what is, may, whilst it is, possibly not be;]</hi> Which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Expression, tho' they may seem to some but a meer Unconcerning School-Speculation; and Unreflecting Men may think it deserves no other Note, but that of being <hi>Ridiculous;</hi> yet, I judge my self obliged to declare, that it is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over most enormously Mischievous; and that it quite perverts and destroys (by a very immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Consequence) the Nature and Notion of <hi>all Certainty</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> whatsoever, and of <hi>Being</hi> too; and quite overthrows all possibility of Knowing <hi>any thing at all.</hi> Had they said <hi>[I think it true or certain]</hi> none would blame them; rather 'tis a Credit for such Men even to <hi>think</hi> heartily there is any <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Certainty</hi> at all in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; but to joyn (as they do) <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> to <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Certainty,</hi> as a kind of <hi>Mode</hi> affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, is to clap these most unconsociable Things, <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkness,</hi> into one <hi>Dusky</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, to abet Nonsense, and palliate Ignorance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Notion immediately next in order to <hi>Existence,</hi> as that which has the very least Potentiality that can be <note place="margin">The meaning of <hi>[Ens]</hi> or <hi>[Thing.]</hi>
                  </note> in the Line of Being, is that of <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>Thing.</hi> Wherefore the meaning of that word can be no other but that of <hi>[Capable to be]</hi> for, no <hi>Created</hi> Thing has <hi>Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Being,</hi> or <hi>Existence,</hi> in its Essential-Notion, but

of its own Nature may <hi>be</hi> or <hi>not be;</hi> as, besides what's proved in my <note n="*" place="margin">B. 3. L. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Method,</hi> is seen in the very Notion of <hi>Creature;</hi> which signifies <hi>That which has its</hi> Being <hi>from Another;</hi> which, therefore, can, <hi>of its self,</hi> be only <hi>Capable of Being.</hi> That the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Ens</hi> is distinct from that of <hi>Existence</hi> is demonstrated <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and is farther evident hence, that the Notion of <hi>what has</hi> Existence must be different from <hi>what's had</hi> by it, or from <hi>Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence</hi> it self. All Mankind has this Notion of <hi>Thing</hi> in them; for they experience that every Thing <hi>can exist,</hi> by seeing it <hi>does so;</hi> and they know also they <hi>are not of themselves,</hi> whether they hold a first Being, or no; because they do gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally see that Causes produced them. Wherefore all that can be said, or thought of the word <hi>[Ens]</hi> is, that it signifies the <hi>Thing</hi> precisely, as 'tis <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Whence follows, that the Abstract Terms, <hi>[Entity]</hi> or <hi>[Essence]</hi> do proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signify <hi>[A Capacity of Being,]</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Meaning of <hi>[Entity]</hi> or <hi>[Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.]</hi>

                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:95549:76"/>
6. To understand which more clearly we are to Note that the Notion and Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the word <hi>[Matter]</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Meaning of <hi>[Matter]</hi> and <hi>[Form;]</hi> or of <hi>[Power]</hi> and <hi>[Act.]</hi>
                  </note> signifies the <hi>Thing,</hi> or Body pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely, as it is a <hi>Power to be a Thing;</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> signifies the same Thing, according to that in it which determins it to be a Thing <hi>Actually.</hi> We are to reflect too, that <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Act,</hi> considered in the Line of <hi>Being,</hi> are the same as <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form;</hi> only the Former words are purely <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical,</hi> because they express the parts of <hi>Ens</hi> as <hi>Ens;</hi> in regard no other conceptions in the Line of Being can possibly be framed of a Body, but as it is Determinable, or Determinative, which are the very Notions of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Act;</hi> whereas <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> tho' in Bodies they signify the same as the former, seem rather to incline to the parts of such an <hi>Ens,</hi> or Body, <hi>Physically</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To show <hi>literally</hi> what's meant by this say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute the compleat <hi>Ens,</hi> or make <note place="margin">What's meant lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon saying, that <hi>Matter</hi> and Form <hi>compound</hi> Body.</note> the Subject <hi>capable of Existing,</hi> I discourse thus. Nothing as 'tis <hi>Indeterminate</hi> or <hi>Common to more</hi> can be ultimately <hi>Capable to be:</hi> v. g, neither a Man <hi>in Common,</hi> nor a Horse <hi>in Common,</hi> can possibly exist, but <hi>This</hi> Man, or <hi>This</hi> Horse: Whatever therefore does determin the Potentiality, or Indifferency of the Subject as it is <hi>Matter,</hi> or, which is the same, a <hi>Power</hi> to be of such or such a <hi>Nature,</hi> (which is what we call to have such a <hi>Form</hi> in it) does make it <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That,</hi> and, consequently, disposes it for <hi>Existence.</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:95549:76"/>
Wherefore since the <hi>particular Complexion</hi> of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Modes and Accidents do determin the <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Matter,</hi> so as to make it Distinct from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it does by Consequence determin it to be <hi>This,</hi> and, so, makes it <hi>Capable of Existing;</hi> that is, an <hi>Ens</hi> or Thing. I enlarge not upon this Point, because I have treated it so amply in the Appendix to my <hi>Method to Science.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Hence is seen what is, or can, with good Sense, be meant by that Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical, or Entitative part called <note place="margin">The Literal Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> or <hi>Essential</hi> Forms.</note> by the Schools, the <hi>Substantial or Essential Form;</hi> which they say, does, with the Matter, make up that compound <hi>Ens,</hi> call'd <hi>Body;</hi> and that, in <hi>Literal Truth,</hi> it can be nothing else but that Complexion of the <hi>Modes,</hi> or <hi>Accidents,</hi> which conspire to make that peculiar or primige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Constitution of every Body, at the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant of its being thus ultimately Determin'd to be <hi>This.</hi> For, this Original Temperature of the Mixt or <hi>Animal,</hi> being once settled by the Steady Concurrence of its Causes; <hi>whatever</hi> Particles or <hi>Effluviums,</hi> or <hi>how many</hi> soever, which are <hi>Agreeable</hi> to it, do afterwards <hi>accrue</hi> to it, are so digested into, or assimilated, to its Nature, that they conserve, nourish and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and not destroy it.

To explicate which more fully, let us consider <hi>how</hi> the Causes in Nature, which are many times of a <hi>Different,</hi> sometimes of a <hi>Contrary</hi> Temper to the Compound, do work upon a Body; and how they make (as they needs must) <hi>preternatural</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions

in it; till, when those Disagreeable Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations arrive to such a pitch, as quite to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert</hi> the <hi>former</hi> Complexion of Accidents, which we call its <hi>Form;</hi> a <hi>new</hi> Form, or <hi>new</hi> Complexion succeeds, determining the Matter to be <hi>Another Thing;</hi> till it self also, wrought upon in the same Manner, comes to be <hi>Corrupted,</hi> and so makes way for a New Off-spring.

                  <hi>Corollary.</hi> The Reason why our Moderns do so oppose <hi>Substantial</hi> or <hi>Essential Forms,</hi> are reduced to two Heads: <note place="margin">The Reason why some Moderns op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> or <hi>Essential</hi> Forms.</note>

which is a vastly disparate Notion from the Constituting and Denominating them <hi>One Thing,</hi> as common Sense informs us. We will put an Instance: My Hand and my Pen do both of them concur to the <hi>Action</hi> of Writing, and so compound <hi>one Joint-Acter;</hi> nay, they <hi>depend mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi> on one another as to the producing this <hi>Action:</hi> For the Hand cannot write without the Pen, nor the Pen without the Hand: Besides, they are in some sort <hi>fitted to one another,</hi> in order to perform this Action; for, the Fingers are so fram'd, as to hold and guide the Pen very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously; and the Pen (taking in its Handle and the Nib-end too) is fitted very commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to be held and guided by my Hand, so as to draw the Letters such as they ought to be. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which is <hi>much more,</hi> and a Parallel <hi>very</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Co-action of Soul and Body, they both of them do modifie <hi>each other's</hi> Action. For, the <hi>best Scrivener</hi> writes but scurvily with a <hi>Bad Pen,</hi> and the <hi>Best Pen</hi> writes but scurvily in an <hi>unskilful Hand.</hi> And yet the Hand and the Pen are not one Jot the nearer being <hi>one Thing,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Concurrence to this <hi>Joint-Action;</hi> tho' it be qualify'd with Mutuality, Fitness of the Co-Agents, and the Modification which the Action receives from both of them jointly, and each of them severally. Besides, they put the Cart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Horse, while they pretend that the <hi>Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as one Thing</hi> is to <hi>make them one-Thing.</hi> For since the <hi>Res</hi> is, in Priority of Nature and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, before <hi>Modus rei;</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> before <hi>Acting;</hi> and that nothing can <hi>Act</hi> otherwise than <hi>it is;</hi> 'tis Evident from plainest Principles, and even from the very <hi>Terms,</hi> that they must first <hi>Be one Thing,</hi>

e'er they can <hi>Act as one Thing,</hi> or <hi>Be</hi> such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, before they can <hi>Act</hi> as such a Compound.

But, why they should be above our <hi>Reason,</hi> I cannot
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95549:88"/>
imagin; or, why they should be deem'd so My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious, as not to be Knowable without a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation. It is manifest, that we can have Abstract Notions of Existence, Thing, Immaterial, Incorporeal, Knowledge, Will, Operation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, we can Consider the Common Subject <hi>[Thing]</hi> as Existent, Capable of Being, and (if it be a <hi>Spirit)</hi> as Immaterial, Incorporeal, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Willing, and Operating, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians can a <hi>Body,</hi> as Extended, Round, or Triangular, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, then, I would know why we cannot, by attentive Consideration, and due Reflexion on those Things, as <hi>thus conceiv'd</hi> by us, frame a <hi>Science</hi> grounded on the Things <hi>thus apprehended,</hi> as well as <hi>Mathematicians</hi> can upon a <hi>Body</hi> consider'd as grounding <hi>their</hi> proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; or, as grounding their Notions of such and such <hi>Modes</hi> of Quantity; such as are the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, Proportions, or Figures of it. Let us not Blaspheme in our Thoughts the Bounty of Infinite Goodness. It was the Devil's first Calumny against <hi>God,</hi> that he <hi>envy'd</hi> Manking Knowledge: Let not us carry it on, by entertaining such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Conceit of Essential Goodness; but, dispose our selves by seeking a <hi>Right Method</hi> to Knowledge, and pursuing it with Industrious Study, and we may be Certain of Success. While I was writing my <hi>Method to Science,</hi> the Attempt to shew the <hi>Reason</hi> all along, for such Notions as were taken from the Thing, according to the manner of Being it had <hi>in my Understanding,</hi> and, therefore, was to be carried through with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>Reflexion</hi> on the Things <hi>there,</hi> did appear so discouraging, that I was sometimes half sorry I had undertaken it: But I saw the World <hi>needed</hi>

it, and knew all Truths were <hi>Connected,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was confident of <hi>God</hi>'s Assistance in such a necessary and useful Occasion. Indeed, Providence has left us no Means to know what is done in the Moon, or other Stars, (tho', perhaps, they are as busie there, as we are in this Sublunary Planet, the Earth,) because it is not to our purpose to know such Things. But, whoever considers those Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical Objects, will, at first sight, discover how <hi>Useful</hi> the Knowledge of them is, both in regard of their Influence upon all <hi>Inferior Sciences,</hi> and to raise us to <hi>Contemplation;</hi> as also, to Explicate, Establish, Defend and Comfort <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> For, there is a <hi>Gradation</hi> of Truths, as well as a <hi>Connexion</hi> of one Truth with another.

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. I Agree perfectly with this Learned Author, <hi>That our Observation employ'd either about External Sensible Objects, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Internal Operations of our</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor agrees and disagrees with Mr. <hi>Locke.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Minds, perceived and reflected on by our selves, is that which supplies our Understandings with all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of Thinking.</hi> As also, that a Man <hi>first thinks</hi> when he begins to have any Sensations. That the Impressions made on the Senses are the Originals of all Knowledge. That the Mind is of its own Nature fitted to receive those Impressions. That in receiving <hi>Ideas</hi> or Notions at first the Mind is <hi>Passive.</hi> That 'tis all one to say, the <hi>Soul</hi> and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95549:90"/>
the <hi>Man</hi> thinks. And, Lastly, <hi>That Men do not always think;</hi> which last <hi>Thesis</hi> he confutes here very elaborately: But, I cannot at all agree to some Positions he makes use of to oppose this last <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> and, indeed, <hi>needlesly;</hi> for he produces good store of <hi>solid</hi> Arguments sufficient to confute it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For First, He makes <hi>the having Ideas and Perception to be the same thing.</hi> I apprehend he means, that when <note place="margin">We may have No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving we have them.</note> we <hi>have Ideas,</hi> we must perceive we have them; because he says afterwards, that the <hi>Soul must necessarily be conscious of its own Perception.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had he said the <hi>Having Ideas,</hi> when he is <hi>Awake,</hi> and <hi>Attentively reflects</hi> on those <hi>Ideas,</hi> it had been a Certain and Evident Truth: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, 'tis manifest that we retain or <hi>have</hi> our <hi>Ideas</hi> or <hi>Notions</hi> in our Mind when we are <hi>soundly asleep,</hi> (it being a strange and extravagant Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox to say, that we get them all again as soon as ever our Eyes are open;) and yet we <hi>do not then</hi> know them; and, to say <hi>we do,</hi> is to come over to his Adversary, and grant the <hi>Thesis</hi> he is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning: For, if a Man does <hi>think</hi> when he is <hi>sound asleep,</hi> 'tis without Question that he may <hi>think always.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Next, I must utterly deny his Position, that <hi>We cannot think without being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible or conscious of it.</hi> To dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove <note place="margin">We may <hi>Think,</hi> without being <hi>Conscious</hi> that we <hi>Think.</hi>
                  </note> which I alledge, that when a Man is quite absorpt in a serious Thought, or (as we say) in a <hi>Brown Study,</hi> his Mind is so <hi>totally</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with the <hi>Object</hi> of his <hi>present</hi> Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which perhaps is something <hi>without him)</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:95549:91"/>
that he can have no Thought, at that very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, of his own <hi>Internal</hi> Operation, or that he is <hi>Thinking,</hi> or any thing like it. I have been call'd sometimes from my Study to Dinner, and answered, <hi>I am coming.</hi> Upon my Delay, they call'd me again, and ask'd, Why I came not, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving promis'd it? I deny'd I heard, or saw, or answered them; yet, upon Recollection, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd afterwards that <hi>I did.</hi> I <hi>knew</hi> then that they call'd me, since I understood their Words, and answered <hi>pertinently;</hi> yet, it is most manifest, that I did not at the Time of the first Call under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that I understood it, or <hi>know</hi> that I <hi>knew</hi> it, since it came only into my Mind afterwards by Reminiscence or <hi>Reflexion;</hi> which argues I had the Knowledge of it <hi>before</hi> by a <hi>Direct</hi> Impression, otherwise I could not have <hi>remember'd it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Tho' this <hi>Thesis</hi> of Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s is mention'd hereafter, it were not amiss to speak my Sense of it where I first <note place="margin">'Tis impossible to be <hi>Conscious,</hi> or <hi>know</hi> we know, without a <hi>new</hi> Act of Reflexion.</note> meet it. He judges, that we know our own Thoughts, (which are <hi>Spiritual)</hi> by <hi>Experience;</hi> And I deny we have any Experience but by Direct Impressions from <hi>sensible</hi> Objects, either coming from them at first, or re-excited. He thinks it impossible to <hi>know,</hi> but we must at the same time be <hi>Conscious,</hi> or (which is the same) <hi>know we know:</hi> And, I judge it impossible we should <hi>know we know</hi> at the same time we have that Act <hi>only,</hi> till <hi>afterwards</hi> we come to <hi>reflect</hi> upon it by a <hi>new</hi> Act; which is to know it, <hi>not by Experience,</hi> but <hi>by Reflexion.</hi> My Reason why I am so positive in my Assertion, is this: Nothing can be <hi>known</hi> by any Act of Knowledge but the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95549:91"/>
                  <hi>Object</hi> of that Act: For the <hi>Object</hi> of Knowing, and the Thing <hi>known,</hi> are the same almost in the very Terms, and <hi>perfectly</hi> the same in Sense. Put case then I know by a <hi>Direct</hi> Impression what we call <hi>Extension;</hi> in this case <hi>Extension</hi> is the <hi>sole Object</hi> of that Act of Knowledge, and not my <hi>Act</hi> of Knowledge <hi>it self;</hi> therefore I am not <hi>conscious</hi> I know; that is, I do not <hi>know I know</hi> when I have the Act of knowing <hi>Extension:</hi> For, were it so, Extension would not be the <hi>Sole Object</hi> of that Act, but the <hi>Complex</hi> made up of <hi>Extension,</hi> and the <hi>Act it self</hi> by which I know Extension: which Objects being of <hi>Disparate</hi> Natures, ought to be the Objects of <hi>Different</hi> Acts. Besides, this would hinder any External Object, or Corporeal Mode to be known <hi>Distinctly;</hi> for the <hi>Idea</hi> of it would be Confounded and Mingled with a kind of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Compart, <hi>viz.</hi> my very <hi>Act</hi> it self; for this Act being known (according to him) at the same time with Extension, must needs make up <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>this Act.</hi> Lastly, If we know our own Act Experientially, we should confound <hi>Direct</hi> Knowledges with <hi>Keflex</hi> ones. For (if I understand Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> rightly) he with good Reason makes the <hi>Internal</hi> Operations of the Mind to be the proper Objects of the <hi>Reflex</hi> Acts; and, that the genuin Difference of those two sorts of Acts does consist in this; that by <hi>Direct</hi> ones, we know the Objects which are <hi>in Nature,</hi> or <hi>without us;</hi> and by <hi>Reflex</hi> ones, what's <hi>in the Soul,</hi> or <hi>her Operations;</hi> and not the Things <hi>in Nature,</hi> otherwise than as they are <hi>in that Act:</hi> But if I be <hi>Conscious,</hi> or <hi>know that I know</hi> when I know the Object <hi>without me,</hi> I must by the <hi>same</hi> Act know what's <hi>within me</hi> and what's <hi>without me</hi> both at
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95549:92"/>
once; and so my Act of <hi>Direct</hi> Knowledge would be <hi>Reflex;</hi> or rather, that <hi>one</hi> Act would be <hi>both Direct</hi> and <hi>Reflex,</hi> which makes it Chimerical.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The same Argument demonstrates, that we cannot be Conscious of our <hi>Reflex</hi> Acts at the very time we produce <note place="margin">'Tis impossible to be <hi>Conscious of,</hi> or <hi>know</hi> our <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> Reflex Act, but by a <hi>new</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex one.</note> them. For, my First <hi>Reflex</hi> Act has for its <hi>sole</hi> Object that Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Mind, which I had immediately before by a <hi>Direct</hi> one; and my <hi>Second</hi> Reflex Act has for its Object the <hi>First;</hi> and in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, each succeeding Reflexion has for its Object that <hi>Act</hi> which immediately <hi>preceded.</hi> Wherefore, if the First Reflex Act had for its Object, at the same time, both the <hi>Direct</hi> and <hi>it self</hi> too; that is, did we, when we first Reflected, know by <hi>that very Act it self</hi> that we <hi>did</hi> thus reflect, then the Second Reflex Act would be forestall'd, and have no Proper Object left for it. To clear this bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, let us assign one Reflexion to be the <hi>Last:</hi> It were not the <hi>Last</hi> Reflexion, unless the Object of it were that Reflexion which was the <hi>last but one.</hi> Wherefore, unless that Reflexion that went <hi>last before</hi> was <hi>known</hi> by that Act, and the <hi>last of all</hi> remain'd <hi>unknown,</hi> the Last would have <hi>two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, viz.</hi> The <hi>Preceding</hi> Reflexion and <hi>its self</hi> too. This seems to me as plain Reason as plain can be; and, I believe, Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Different Thoughts proceeded, from not adverting with what Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Celerity our Reflex Thoughts do generally succeed the Direct ones, and one another. Whence it comes, that, not aware of the imperceptible Time between them, we are apt to conceit, that the Reflex Act is <hi>experientially</hi> known by
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95549:92"/>
the very Act it self. Since then, nothing can be known by <hi>any</hi> Act but the <hi>Object</hi> of that Act, and, (as might easily be shown) it would Confound our Natural Notions <note place="margin">Hence, we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to know our <hi>last</hi> Reflexion.</note> strangely, to say, the <hi>Act</hi> is its <hi>own Object;</hi> it follows, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known by <hi>its self,</hi> but must be known (if at all) by the <hi>next</hi> Reflexion. Whence results this Certain and Evident Corollary, that, <hi>It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible we should ever come to know our last Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. These are my Reasons why I recede from Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> in his Opinion, that <hi>A Man cannot think without being</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">'Tis utterly deny'd that Consciousness causes <hi>Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Conscious of it.</hi> But, the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence he seems to draw thence, that therefore <hi>Consciousness</hi> is that which causes <hi>Individuation,</hi> I must abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deny; and cannot but judge, that it draws after it a Train of farther Consequences, which are altogether Extravagant. Of which more, when we come to examin his <hi>Principle of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Position, <hi>[That Men do always think]</hi> which he impugns, and, in my Judgment, quite overthrows, I <note place="margin">The Unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that <hi>Men do always think</hi>
                  </note> cannot but wonder what the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serters of it mean. They grant the <hi>Soul</hi> has Modes and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons peculiar to her <hi>own</hi> Nature; and, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, of which she is properly the <hi>Subject:</hi> Why she may not therefore <hi>retain</hi> them in her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually (as it were) without <hi>exerting</hi> or <hi>exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> them, as well as the <hi>Body</hi> may those proper to <hi>its</hi> Nature, is altogether Unconceivable. Indeed,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95549:93"/>
were the Soul, in this condition she has here, a <hi>Pure Act,</hi> as Angels are, it would consist with good Reason; but being here in a <hi>Potential</hi> State, (as appears by her being <hi>Capable</hi> still of <hi>New</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and her being but a Part of that <hi>one Actual Thing</hi> call'd <hi>Man,</hi> and depending on the Material Compart in her Operations) I cannot see on what Principle, either Physical or Metaphysical, they can pretend to ground such a Paradox. This makes me fear, that this Tenet savours strongly of that odd Opinion, That the Soul here is a <hi>Pure Act</hi> as the <hi>Angels are,</hi> or a Distinct Thing from the Body; that is, a <hi>Forma Assistens,</hi> and not <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formans;</hi> tho' they are loath to own it barefacedly, but shift it off with witty Explications of their own Doctrine; which, when brought to the Test of Close Reason, vanish into Air; at which ingenious ways of Evasion it must be confess'd they are very great Artists.</p>

I could wish he had taken the <hi>Distinction</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of his Notions from <hi>Nature;</hi> which Teaches us that the Notion of <hi>[Res]</hi> is before <hi>[Modus Rei;]</hi> and that the Consideration or Notion of <hi>[Thing]</hi> is more Knowable than that of <hi>any Mode;</hi> and the Mode of <hi>quantity</hi> is that which naturally antecedes, and grounds, all the <note place="margin">The Order of our Notions is to be taken from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>other</hi> Modes that can be conceiv'd belonging to Body. Nor will it excuse this Deviation from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that we have no exact Notions of Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; since we can abstract the Notion of <hi>Entity</hi> or <hi>Capacity of Being</hi> from the Thing, as well as we can its <hi>Solidity,</hi> or any of the rest. And certainly, that Notion which Expresses <hi>Reality,</hi> or an Order to <hi>Being,</hi> should claim a Right to be consider'd in the <hi>first</hi> place: I cannot but judge that the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95549:94"/>
Methodizing of his <hi>Ideas</hi> on this manner, would certainly have made his ensuing Discourses <hi>more Orderly,</hi> and consequently <hi>more Clear.</hi> But, every Man is Master of his own Thoughts, and of his own Method. Nor did Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> intend to write an Exact Logick, which is what I aym'd at; and therefore took that way that best suted with his own ingenious Conception; which was, that, as all our Notions (as we both of us hold) come into our Mind by our Senses, so he apprehended it the properest way to treat of them as they are the Objects of <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That,</hi> or <hi>many</hi> different Sensations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His 4th. Chapter of <hi>Solidity</hi> gives me Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of making some few Reflexions; which I shall touch on slightly, or omit, because they recurr hereafter.</p>
               <p>First, His using the word <hi>[Solidity]</hi> in his New Sense seems very Improper. For, all our Words do either Signify <note place="margin">The Word <hi>[Solidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty]</hi> arbitrarily and abusively tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by M. <hi>L.</hi>
                  </note> our <hi>Natural Notions,</hi> which are <hi>Common</hi> to all Mankind, whose Meaning therefore is to be taken from the Usage of the <hi>Vulgar;</hi> or else <hi>Artificial</hi> ones, invented by Artists to express the Notions they are Conversant about: Whereas the Word <hi>[Solidity]</hi> taken as it is <hi>here,</hi> seems to agree to <hi>neither.</hi> I do not remember it is ever us'd in an <hi>Artificial</hi> Sense but by Mathematicians, who sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify by it the Triple Dimension of Quantity; which is quite different from his Sense of it: And the <hi>Vulgar</hi> Understand and Use the Word <hi>[Solid]</hi> as opposit to <hi>[Fluid;]</hi> and say that the Earth is <hi>Solid,</hi> or <hi>Firm,</hi> and the Water <hi>Fluid,</hi> or apt to be Diffus'd; both which Senses are vastly different
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95549:94"/>
from <hi>Impenetrability</hi> of the Potential parts of Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; which is the meaning he gives it: So that, as far as I have read, no Man ever used the Word <hi>[Solidity]</hi> in his Sense but himself; and it is not at all allowable to Him, Me, or any Man, to give a <hi>new</hi> Sense to any Word not given it <hi>before.</hi> For, this discourse of mine shows it can have no <hi>Proper Sense</hi> at all; and on the other side he does not take it in a <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Sense, as we use to do when we transferr it to <hi>Spiritual</hi> Things, and call a Notion or a Discourse <hi>Solid.</hi> All Words are indeed <hi>Ad placitum;</hi> but 'tis <hi>Mankind</hi> that must <hi>please</hi> to agree in their Signification; nor must they be at the <hi>Beneplacitum</hi> of <hi>Particular</hi> Men, or <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> Authors.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He declines, with some reason, the Word <hi>[Impenetrability]</hi> because it is <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative:</hi> But why might not then <note place="margin">His Solidity not at all <hi>Essential</hi> to Body.</note> 
                  <hi>Extension</hi> have serv'd, which bears the same Sense? For that, whose Notion or Nature it is to have its parts <hi>without one another,</hi> cannot bear the having them <hi>within one another,</hi> or their being Penetrated <hi>within themselves;</hi> which is his Notion of the Word <hi>[Solidity.]</hi> He conceives his <hi>Solidity to be most intimately connected with, and Essential to Body, and no where to be found or imagin'd but only in Matter,</hi> But why his <hi>Solidity</hi> should be deem'd <hi>Essential</hi> to Body at all, he gives no reason, and I am well assur'd no Man living <hi>can</hi> give any; For it confounds the Line of <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Ens,</hi> with that of <hi>Quality;</hi> which jumbles all our Commonest Notions together, by making the <hi>Thing</hi> and its <hi>Mode</hi> to be the same Essential Notion. Nor is it <hi>Solidity only that is necessarily found in Matter;</hi> for
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95549:95"/>
neither can Extension, Divisibility, Measurability, Space, Impenetrability, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be found any where but in things made of <hi>Matter,</hi> But, what I most wonder at, is, why <hi>[Quantity]</hi> should be totally wav'd and neglected, That Word having been used by all the Learned World, till of late, is (as has been shown, <hi>Preliminary 5th.</hi> §. 18.) most Proper; and, either directly, or by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate consequence, involves all the rest in its Signification. For, if a Body have Bigness or <hi>Quantity</hi> in it, it must be <hi>Extended,</hi> and cannot be <hi>Contracted</hi> into a Point, Line or Surface. It must be <hi>Divisible,</hi> or <hi>One</hi> in the Notion of Quantity. And, if it must be <hi>Extended</hi> and cannot be crampt into an Indivisible, its parts cannot be <hi>penetrated</hi> within one another; however it may be pierced or Divided by another Body, by shoving its po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential parts towards either side. Lastly, it must be <hi>Measurable,</hi> or Proportionable to a Body of the same Quantity. So that I see not what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginable Priviledge can accrue to <hi>Solidity</hi> above the rest: And, it seems to me a New and Groundless assertion, that <hi>Impenetrability</hi> (tho' we abate the Negative manner of Expression) is <hi>Essential</hi> at all to Body, more than <hi>any</hi> of the <hi>rest;</hi> that is, <hi>not at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. This acute Writer, in pursuance of his Doctrine about <hi>Solidity,</hi> proceeds to prove there may be <hi>Pure Space,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Space without Body, <hi>or</hi> Vacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, <hi>is a meer Groundless</hi> Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</note> or <hi>Vacuum;</hi> because we can have an <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Space</hi> left by a Body without the <hi>Idea</hi> of another Solid Thing, or a Body, coming in its Room. I Answer, we may Indeed have a <hi>Fancy</hi> of such a Thing, as we may of many other
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95549:95"/>
Contradictions, so they be not exprest in directly opposit Terms, <hi>v. g.</hi> of a Golden Animal, or a Chimera, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, I utterly deny that we can have a <hi>True</hi> and Solid <hi>Notion</hi> of it, taken from the <hi>Thing</hi> it self; as all <hi>Ideas</hi> must be, that are not <hi>Phantastick.</hi> He thinks there is no Necessity, one Body should follow another that is moved from such a Space; and that the Maintainers of it do <hi>build</hi> their Assertion <hi>on</hi> the <hi>Supposition that the World is full.</hi> What other Men hold of the <hi>World's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Full,</hi> I know not, nor what they mean by it; but I will candidly deliver my Sentiment, and the Demonstration for it <hi>a priori,</hi> which is this: I take my <hi>Notion</hi> of Quantity from the Thing, or Body; and, I have shewn above, that that <hi>Notion</hi> is the <hi>Nature of the Thing,</hi> as 'tis Quantitative, or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with such a <hi>Mode.</hi> Here is my <hi>firm Ground,</hi> and here I <hi>fix my Foot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Proceeding hence, and reflecting on this Nature of <hi>Quantity</hi> in my Mind; I discourse it thus: I am to find <note place="margin">The Contrary to that Tenet De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated.</note> out in what its (Analogical) <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> or <hi>Entity</hi> consists; and I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, it must be in that which expresses its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Unity:</hi> Seeing then <hi>Divisibility</hi> best expresses its <hi>Unity,</hi> (for, what is <hi>Divisible,</hi> or <hi>Capable to be more,</hi> is, <hi>eo ipso, One,)</hi> I have found out the <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Notion</hi> or Nature of <hi>Quantity;</hi> and, since what is <hi>Divisible,</hi> or <hi>not yet Divided,</hi> is <hi>Continued;</hi> and what is <hi>Continued</hi> as to its Quantity, is not <hi>Discontinued</hi> or <hi>Divided</hi> according to its Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; therefore <hi>Continuity</hi> is its proper <hi>Unity;</hi> which consists in being <hi>Indivisum in se,</hi> or within its <hi>own</hi> Notion, and <hi>Formally</hi> constitutes its Subject <hi>such.</hi> Wherefore, since the <hi>Essence</hi> of Quantity is the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95549:96"/>
Commonest Affection of <hi>Body,</hi> taken in its whole Latitude, as including <hi>all Bodies,</hi> it follows, that <hi>Continuity,</hi> which is its <hi>Unity,</hi> must be found in them <hi>all</hi> likewise; that is, <hi>all</hi> Bodies, or the whole Nature of Body, that is, the <hi>Entire Bulk</hi> of Body, must be <hi>Continued.</hi> And therefore, 'tis as great a Contradiction, that some Bodies, or some Parts of Body, should <hi>not be Continued,</hi> (or, which is the same, that there should be a <hi>Vacuum,)</hi> as that Triangularity should be in some one Body, and yet it should not be Triangular; that Whiteness should be in a Wall, and yet it should not be White; or <hi>Unity</hi> in a Thing, and yet it self should not be <hi>Unum.</hi> This is my Way of Demonstrating against <hi>Vacuum</hi> within the World, to <hi>prove,</hi> and not <hi>suppose,</hi> the World <hi>Full,</hi> or <hi>Continued;</hi> which I draw out of the Abstract Notion of <hi>Quantity,</hi> or of Body consider'd as <hi>Quantitative;</hi> and out of those Notions, most Intimately and Essentially Connected with it. Which, why it should not be as Evident as any Demonstration in Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; or why we cannot draw as clear a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration from the Nature of <hi>Quantity</hi> in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> as we can from the Nature of <hi>such a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi> I desire any Man, who is so wise as to know that all Science and Demonstration do consist in the <hi>Connexion of Terms,</hi> to inform me. I say, any <hi>such</hi> Man; for, if he <hi>knows not</hi> This, it is Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible he should know <hi>any</hi> Thing <hi>at all</hi> in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or even in <hi>Logick;</hi> and so he is not worth discoursing with.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence is seen, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible <note place="margin">Therefore 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible there should be any True Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment to prove a <hi>Vacuum.</hi>
                  </note> that a Sucker in a Pump may draw up Water, and yet the next Body not follow. We may

                  <hi>Fancy</hi> it if we please; but our Fancy cannot change the <hi>Natures of Things:</hi> It cannot make Continuity <hi>not to be</hi> Continuity; Quantitative Unity, <hi>not to be</hi> such an Unity; nor Quantity, <hi>not to be</hi> Quantity; any more than his Solidity can be Non-Solidity, or the Parts of Body pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate one another. Had Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> had a Notion of <hi>Space,</hi> taken indifferently from <hi>Body,</hi> and something that's <hi>not Body,</hi> as we have of Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveness from <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Brute;</hi> he might, in that Case, have fram'd an <hi>Abstract</hi> Notion of it, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Indifferent to <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Vacuum;</hi> for, then, it had been grounded on the <hi>Thing,</hi> and had been a <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>true</hi> Notion; but, since he had the <hi>Idea,</hi> or Notion of <hi>Space</hi> from <hi>Body only,</hi> and therefore (as was largely prov'd above) it could be of nothing else, but of <hi>Body thus Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> it must be confin'd to <hi>Body,</hi> with which (as all Modes are) it is <hi>Identified;</hi> and therefore, the <hi>Idea,</hi> or Notion of it, can never be applicable to what <hi>is not a Body.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. As for his 8th Chapter, I grant, that all the <hi>Ideas,</hi> or Notions, we have, are <hi>Positive in the Understanding,</hi> (at <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Privative</hi> Notions must Connotate the Subject.</note> least, in <hi>part;)</hi> but the Reason of it is, because they do, all of them, <hi>include</hi> the <hi>Thing,</hi> as 'tis thus <hi>consider'd;</hi> without which, we could have no <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> or <hi>Negations</hi> at all: For, <hi>Non-Ens,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally as such, or as totally Excluding <hi>Ens,</hi> can have no <hi>Intelligibility,</hi> nor, consequently, any <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> by which we can understand it: And <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> differ from <hi>Negations</hi> only in this, that they include in their Notion a <hi>Capacity</hi> of the Subjects having such or such a Mode, annex'd to its <hi>not having</hi> it; which <hi>Capacity</hi> clearly Conno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the <hi>Thing,</hi> since there cannot be a <hi>Capacity,</hi> without some <hi>Thing</hi> that <hi>is</hi> Capable, or <hi>has</hi> that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95549:97"/>
Add, that I see not how, <hi>Ideas</hi> being <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances,</hi> an <hi>Idea, consider'd by us as a Positive real Being,</hi> can ever resemble or represent <hi>Privations,</hi> they being of (at least) Subcontrary Natures. What I hold, is, that, when we conceive a Thing, as having some Privation in it, the <hi>Idea</hi> of it is partly <hi>Positive,</hi> partly <hi>Privative;</hi> and the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Part of it is the <hi>Thing;</hi> the Formal, as <hi>Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> or, as thus Modify'd. For, <hi>Ideas,</hi> I mean, <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of Privations, without including the <hi>Thing,</hi> are Unconceivable, <hi>and</hi> Impossible; as whoever looks into their <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Prelim. 3. §. 9, 10, 11.</note> Definition, will discern clearly. Of this Nature (in Common) are all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have of the Modes, or Accidents; no Notion being truly or perfectly <hi>Positive,</hi> but that of <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>Thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot grant that our <hi>Ideas,</hi> or <hi>Notions,</hi> (or even Phantasms,) are caus'd in us by meer <hi>Motions, continued from</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Meer <hi>Motions</hi> made upon the Senses, Insufficient to give us <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</note> 
                  <hi>our Senses, to the Brain, or the Seat of Sensation;</hi> but must judge, for the Reasons alledg'd <note n="*" place="margin">Prelim. 4. §. 26, 27, 28, &amp;c.</note> above, that this is perform'd by those <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible Bodies</hi> there spoken of, or by the <hi>Effluviums</hi> themselves <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd thither,</hi> and afterwards <hi>lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there.</hi> In embracing which Opinion, of our Knowledge being wrought by meer <hi>Motions</hi> made by the Objects, his Excellent Wit suffers it self to be led astray by our Moderns. His Reason (which I conceive is also theirs) is, because <hi>it is not more impossible to conceive, that God should annex such Ideas to such Motions, than Pain to a piece of Steel dividing the Body, with which that Idea has no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance.</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:95549:98"/>
How unlike a Reason this is, appears at first fight; and, I am sure this Parallel has <hi>no</hi> Resemblance <hi>at all</hi> with the Thing it is brought for. I know of no <hi>Annexing</hi> the <hi>Idea</hi> of Pain to a piece of Steel; but, must think 'tis a most high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extravagant Conceit. The Business passes thus in Nature. A piece of Steel being <hi>Denser,</hi> and withall <hi>sharp,</hi> is a <hi>proper</hi> Cause of <hi>Dividing</hi> the <hi>Body;</hi> the <hi>Dividing</hi> of it, is a <hi>proper</hi> Cause of its being disorder'd, and render'd unable to <hi>assist</hi> the Soul, or the Man, in his necessary Operations: This breeds naturally a Conception in the Soul, or the Man, that he is hurt; which <hi>Naturally</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in the Knower, who is highly concern'd in it, <hi>Grief</hi> or <hi>Pain:</hi> So that all is here carry'd on by a Train of <hi>proper Causes,</hi> to <hi>proper Effects;</hi> and needs no <hi>Annexing by God,</hi> more than to conserve the Order of Second Causes which himself has establish'd. On the other side, there is no <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Resemblance</hi> of such a Motion to such an <hi>Idea,</hi> as is confess'd; nor is the former a <hi>Proper Cause</hi> of the other; which puts them to have recourse to this Voluntary <hi>Annexion</hi> to them by <hi>God.</hi> Add, that it is an odd kind of Argument, to alledge, that <hi>it is not impossible to conceive</hi> that <hi>God <hi>may</hi>
                  </hi> do this, or that, without proving he <hi>has</hi> done it: Nor is it at all allowable in Philosophy, to bring in a <hi>Deus è Machinâ</hi> at every turn, when our selves are at a loss to give a Reason for our <hi>Thesis.</hi> Nor is it to be expected, that <hi>God</hi> will alter the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things, for the Interest of any Man's Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net; but, since his Wisdom, in his Ordinary Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World, carries on the Course of it according to the Nature of Second Causes, it must first be <hi>prov'd,</hi> that what we maintain, is
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:95549:98"/>
Agreeable to the Course of Natural Causes, e'er we ought to think or imagin that <hi>God</hi> will have any hand in it: And, if we can <hi>prove</hi> this, we need no Immediate or <hi>particular</hi> Recourse to <hi>God</hi>'s favouring us, by doing This, or That, to make good our Argument.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I must deny too, consequently to my former Doctrine, that <hi>Sensible Qualities are nothing in the Objects,</hi> but <note place="margin">Sensible Qualities are the same in the <hi>Objects,</hi> as in the <hi>Mind.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Powers to produce various Sensations in us;</hi> unless it be meant, that they have Powers to send out such <hi>Effluviums</hi> into the Brain, by the Senses, as imprint their very Natures in our Mind; and not barely to produce Motions in our Nerves. Nor can I conceive why the <hi>Ideas</hi> of the <hi>Secondary</hi> Qualities should have <hi>nothing like them, existing in the Bodies themselves;</hi> nor be <hi>Resemblances</hi> of them. If this be true, why are they call'd <hi>[Ideas,]</hi> which either signifies <hi>Resemblances,</hi> or <hi>Nothing?</hi> Again, since the Bodies are put to <hi>cause</hi> them, how can we think they are <hi>nothing like</hi> them? Can any Man think the <hi>Effect</hi> is <hi>nothing like</hi> the <hi>Cause,</hi> when every Effect can be nothing but a Participation of the Cause, or something coming <hi>into</hi> the Subject from the Efficient, which was <hi>in it</hi> some way or other before? Lastly, If these <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary</hi> Qualities be <hi>compounded</hi> of the Primary ones, <hi>(viz.</hi> of Solidity, Extension, Figure and Mobility) <hi>in our Understanding,</hi> why should not those <hi>Primary</hi> Qualities <hi>in re, as well</hi> compound those <hi>Secondary</hi> ones in the <hi>Thing,</hi> or <hi>out of</hi> our Understanding? And, if they do, (as 'tis evident they must, since they are all <hi>there,)</hi> then, why are not those Secondary <hi>Ideas</hi> full as like those

Secondary or Compounded Qualities found in the <hi>Thing,</hi> as the Primary <hi>Ideas</hi> were <hi>like</hi> the Primary Qualities in the <hi>same Thing;</hi> and, consequently, <hi>resemble</hi> them, <hi>as well</hi> as the <hi>others</hi> did their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Originals? I much doubt, that the Author rather consulted his <hi>Fancy</hi> in this particular, than his good <hi>Reason:</hi> And, because those <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluviums,</hi> or the <hi>Figures</hi> of Parts, which cause our Sensations, are too Subtile and Indiscernable to cause Distinct Phantasms of themselves, as the Primary ones did, but are of a Confus'd Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formness in Appearance, he judges hence, they are <hi>Nothing like</hi> the others: Whereas, Reason will inform Reflecters, that, since Colour is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the <hi>Surface of a Body, as 'tis apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect Light;</hi> the manner of Reflexion found in the Surface of a <hi>White</hi> Thing, which is apt to reflect <hi>much</hi> Light, is, to our <hi>Reason,</hi> and in our <hi>Notion,</hi> such as it was in the Thing imprinting it; and, consequently, (every thing Acting as <hi>it is,)</hi> such as <hi>came from it.</hi> Whence, those who, by Reflex Thoughts, and using their <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> do go about to explain or <hi>define</hi> the Nature or Notion of <hi>Whiteness,</hi> do make it consist in such a Reflexion of Light, bringing <hi>Effluviums</hi> with it from a Surface so advantagiously Figur'd: And so, the <hi>Notion</hi> of Whiteness is the <hi>same</hi> in the Thing, and in the Understanding; <hi>viz.</hi> those <hi>Effluviums</hi> thus Figur'd, or <hi>Modified,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Appearance of it in the <hi>Fancy</hi> reaches not the true <hi>Nature</hi> of the Thing, as 'tis <hi>White;</hi> which, indeed, Fancy <hi>never</hi> does.</p>

5. The Reason why the <hi>Pain,</hi> which we feel, is not in the Thing that Caus'd it, and Sensible Qualities are so, is, <note place="margin">The Pretence of <hi>GOD</hi>'s Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Annexing Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper</hi> Causes to Effects, is <hi>Unphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical.</hi>
                  </note> because these last are Proper, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivocal, and Immediate Effects of Bodies sending out <hi>Effluviums</hi> of their own Natures; but <hi>Pain,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Affection of the Soul, springing from a Perception that its dear Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part is hurt, and disorder'd, is an Improper, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter, and Equivocal Production. The Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Disordering, or Spoiling the Temperature or Continuity of the Bodily Parts due to their Nature, is, (as was shewn,) the Immediate and Proper Effect of those Offensive Agents; but 'tis Accidental to their manner of Operating, that they cause <hi>Pain, or Pleasure,</hi> even remotely; and, it <hi>lights</hi> only, that <hi>sometimes</hi> they do this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Subject, or the Body, in which they produce these their proper Effects, <hi>haps</hi> to be Identified with a <hi>Knowing</hi> Nature, only which is properly capable to <hi>Grieve,</hi> or be <hi>Delighted</hi> when a Harmful or Pleasing Impression is made on the Body, which is Part of the <hi>Man,</hi> and, in some sort, <hi>himself.</hi> The like is to be said of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and other such Instances. The Alterations or Disorder made in the Guts and Stomach, are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, Proper, and Immediate Effects of it; but the Pain ensuing thence, which is a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Mind, is a <hi>Remote, Accidental,</hi> and <hi>Improper</hi> Effect of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By this Time Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> sees <note place="margin">The <hi>Power</hi> in the Object to cause Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is <hi>Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> such.</note> that I agree with him, that the Bodies in Nature have a Power in them to <hi>cause</hi> our several Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95549:100"/>
and, that this <hi>Power</hi> is that which we call such a <hi>Quality</hi> of it. But I disagree with him, that they are only <hi>Powers</hi> to cause such a <hi>Motion;</hi> and affirm, it is a Power, when duly Circumstanced with other Requisites, (as, with Light, to convey Visible Qualities; Moisture, Gustable ones, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> to send out <hi>Effluviums,</hi> of their own Nature, to the Brain; (which, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are Inherent in, and Proper Parts of those Objects,) whether they cause <hi>Actual</hi> Sensation, or no. The Sun sends out his Beams, which, scatter'd thinly, at this remote distance from the Fountain, are therefore one of Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary Qualities, which we call <hi>Light;</hi> yet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by a Burning-Glass, they perform the Proper Effect of Fire, <hi>Burning;</hi> whence we ought to conclude, they are of the Nature of Fire. Can we then deny, or doubt, but that the Body of the Sun, which communicates, or sends them out, is it self Fire; or, that, being such, those Rays, and the Sun, have <hi>no Similitude</hi> with one another? Or, that, when they strike the Eye, they stop <hi>there,</hi> and are not carry'd <hi>into the Brain? Hippocrates</hi> tells us, that <hi>Omnes partes corporis sunt permeabiles;</hi> meaning, that they are pervious to the <hi>Humours;</hi> which are <hi>gross</hi> Things, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of the Sun-Beams. How can it then be doubted, but that they reach the Fancy; and thence, the Soul; and imprint their Notions or Natures there: And, tho' some may deny they are the <hi>same</hi> in the Mind, as they are in Nature; yet can it, with any Shew of Reason, be deny'd they are <hi>at all like</hi> the Cause that produced them? The like Discourse holds in all other Sensible Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, to what Sense soever they belong.</p>

                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:95549:100"/>
7. To close this Discourse, I am apt to think, that Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> intended to oppose those who hold, that the Sensible Qualities are a little kind of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Entities. Next, I declare, that, tho' the Thing has <hi>accidentally</hi> a <hi>Power</hi> in it, to make it self perceiv'd; yet, taking the Thing as an <hi>Object,</hi> (as he does,) it is but <hi>Improperly</hi> called a <hi>Power;</hi> and not <hi>Properly,</hi> as are our Powers, or Faculties, of Seeing, Hearing, Knowing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are: For, the <hi>Act</hi> being the <hi>End</hi> for which the Power was given, the <hi>Faculties,</hi> or Powers, are <hi>better'd,</hi> and <hi>perfected,</hi> by being reduced to Act; and so there is a real Ground for their being Related to the Object: Whereas, neither the <hi>Object,</hi> or <hi>Thing,</hi> nor any <hi>Sensible Quality</hi> in it, is a Jot the better, or any way Alter'd, by being <hi>perceiv'd,</hi> or <hi>known;</hi> any more than a Cart rolling through the Street, is the <hi>better,</hi> or <hi>otherwise</hi> than it had been, because the <hi>Effluviums</hi> it sends out do make a Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in a Shop full of Looking-Glasses, as it passes by. Whence Logicians say, that there is no <hi>Real</hi> Relation of the <hi>Object</hi> to the <hi>Sense,</hi> or <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect;</hi> because there is no <hi>Real Ground</hi> for such a Relation, nor any <hi>Dependence</hi> of the Object on those Powers, in any kind; <note n="*" place="margin">B. 1.

               <p>PAssing over this Ninth Chapter about <hi>Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I confess my self at a great Loss how to understand divers Passages in his Tenth, which treats of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi>

                     <hi>Ideas</hi> or Notions are not <hi>Actual Perceptions,</hi> but the <hi>Object</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably remaining.</note> or how to make him co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent with himself. For, First, he tells us our <hi>Ideas are nothing but Actual Perceptions of the Mind.</hi> By which Words he seems to make no kind of Distinction between the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Perception</hi> and the <hi>Object</hi> of it; whereas the Act is the <hi>Exercise</hi> of our <hi>Power</hi> of Perceiving, actuated by the <hi>Object</hi> about which it is then employ'd; which Object determins the Indifferency of the Power to <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Act in particular; which the Schools call <hi>Specifying</hi> the Act: But the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> is the <hi>Thing known</hi> by the Act; and 'tis a strange Paradox to say, that the <hi>Act of Knowledge</hi> and the <hi>Object</hi> or <hi>Thing known</hi> are the same; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if the Thing <hi>known</hi> be something <hi>without</hi> us: Next, I cannot reconcile his making our <hi>Ideas</hi> to be nothing but <hi>Actual Perceptions,</hi> with his making our <hi>Ideas,</hi> quite through his Book, to be the <hi>Object</hi> of our Thoughts, and expresly stating them to be <hi>such</hi> in the beginning of it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. § 8. Secondly, he says, That those <hi>Ideas cease to be any thing, when there is no Perception of</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:95549:101"/>
                  <hi>them.</hi> If so, why does he put us to have <hi>Memory</hi> or <hi>Retention,</hi> if, after the Act is past, there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to <hi>keep</hi> in <hi>Memory</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> Thirdly, in Consequence <note place="margin">It destroys the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> to make it consist in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving Ideas.</hi>
                  </note> of this his Ground, he affirms, that <hi>this laying up Ideas in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pository of his Memory, signifies no more, but that the Mind has in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cases a Power</hi> to <hi>Revive</hi> Perceptions, with a Connotate <hi>annext,</hi> of <hi>having had them before.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, this Signification of the word <hi>[Memory]</hi> is peculiar to himself, and contrary to the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all Mankind; who, were they examined by the Poll, would, I believe, unanimously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that by <hi>laying up</hi> a Thing <hi>in Memory,</hi> they meant, (as the Words naturally import) the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi> something which has its being yet <hi>within us,</hi> and may be brought into play again upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. Can the Memory be said to <hi>Retain</hi> what <hi>is not?</hi> Or can there be a Repository of <hi>Nothing?</hi> Is <hi>Reviving</hi> the Notion of <hi>Retaining,</hi> they being rather of a Contrary Sense to one another?

re-excited by outward Objects like the former, or by Passion, Disease, or by some other Casual Circumstances, to rummage the <hi>Ideas</hi> lodged in the Brain; and, so, by their new Impression on the Seat of Knowledge, to cause such an Act, as by it to know the same Thing again; as also to know it was <hi>foreknown,</hi> as was explicated <note n="*" place="margin">Prelim. 4. § 26, 27, 28.</note> above: But to put the Soul to <hi>revive Ideas,</hi> or even to <hi>act,</hi> so that the Action shall begin from her <hi>peculiar</hi> Nature, is Praeternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to her Condition, to her Manner of <hi>Existing,</hi> and consequently, to her manner of <hi>Operating here;</hi> which, as it must be ever <hi>with</hi> the Bodily part or the Fancy, so it must <hi>begin</hi> still <hi>from it,</hi> as it did at first; with this only Difference, that in the first Impressions made on the Sense, and thence on the Seat of Knowledge, the Man (and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly as to his Soul) is perfectly <hi>Passive;</hi> whereas afterwards by vertue of those Phantasms, and their former Impression, which have already affected the said Seat of Knowledge, (which is part of himself) and have been <hi>re-affected</hi> by it, the Man is partly Passive, partly Active in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring; as Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> does, I think, also acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; tho' he explicates it otherwise than I do, <hi>viz.</hi> By the Mind's setting it self on work, which I judge, and have shewn to be Impossible, <hi>Preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.</hi> 4. § 25, 26, 27.</p>

                  </note> expresses it) that <hi>[the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures drawn in our Minds are laid in fading Colours]</hi> he most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95549:102"/>
discovers, that by <hi>Ideas</hi> here he means <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial</hi> Representations or <hi>Phantasms,</hi> and not those <hi>Spiritual</hi> Objects of our Understandings, <hi>Notions.</hi> For, there is no doubt but that Phantasms, they being only Imperceptible Particles, of the same Nature with the Corporeal Agents whence they are sent, do follow, (and that very easily) the Fate of their Originals; and are liable to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, alter'd or corrupted, as <hi>these</hi> are: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is impossible, that <hi>Ideas</hi> or <hi>Notions,</hi> which have a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Being in our <hi>Mind,</hi> should be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any such Decay, Corruption or Mutation. If any thing could prejudice, destroy or efface them, it must in all Reason be thought that their <hi>Contraries</hi> would do it: Whereas clear Reflexion tells us, that Contraries <hi>in the Mind</hi> are so far from Expelling, Blurring, or Altering one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>there,</hi> that they not only very Friendly <hi>dwell together,</hi> but moreover that, by their Co-habitation there, they make one another <hi>magis elucescere,</hi> and Establish one anothers Natures. <hi>Hot</hi> and <hi>Cold, Moist</hi> and <hi>Dry,</hi> which are perpetually fighting, and make such Bustles and Turmoils in the <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> World, are very consistent, and agree ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably in the <hi>Soul.</hi> The Corporeal Instruments which brought our <hi>Notions</hi> thither may perish; but when they are once <hi>in her,</hi> they are as Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable and Immortal as her self. So that the Pictures in our Minds are so far from being <hi>drawn</hi> in <hi>fading Colours,</hi> that they should rather be said (if we would use a Metaphor to express their Durableness) to be engraved in Brass, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or Adamant; being as lasting as Eternity. Which Tenet, were I writing Metaphysicks, I should not doubt but to demonstrate; and withal
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:95549:103"/>
to show how useful it is to explicate Christian Faith: Particularly those Points of laying open the Book of Conscience at the last day; when, as the Sybil sings, <hi>[Cunctaque cunctorum cunctis arcana patebunt.]</hi> And how Infants are connaturally saved by virtue of <hi>Baptism.</hi>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THE 11th. Chapter gives me no occasion to make any Reflexions, but only on his attributing Knowledge to <hi>Brutes;</hi> about which I have been too large <note place="margin">If Brutes can <hi>know,</hi> they may have <hi>General Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare</hi> too.</note> already. He denies indeed that they have the power of <hi>Abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or of having <hi>General Ideas.</hi> But, if they have true Knowledge, or any more than King <hi>David</hi> meant, when he says, <hi>The Sun knows his going down,</hi> I see no reason why they may not have <hi>General</hi> Notions, and <hi>Abstract,</hi> and <hi>Compare</hi> too. For, if they have any Degree of <hi>Reason,</hi> as he grants they have, they may do all this; and I am sure, and have already shown, their <hi>Outward Actions</hi> do as much countenance their having <hi>Reason,</hi> as any signs they give us do shew that they cannot <hi>Abstract,</hi> or have <hi>General Ideas;</hi> since <hi>General Ideas</hi> (as every good Reflecter may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve) are nothing but <hi>Imperfect Ideas</hi> of the <hi>Thing;</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:95549:103"/>
and in a Thousand occasions, the Object or Thing affords them no more, but Imperfect or <hi>General Ideas,</hi> and therefore they must have them. I am much pleased with his Distinction between <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Judgment;</hi> and I could wish that our Men of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, who affect to bring Religion, and all they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not, to Drollery, would apply it to themselves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Author discourses very acutely, how our Reason and Judgment are misguided by our not <hi>distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The distinguishing our Notions guides our <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> right.</note> our Notions <hi>exactly;</hi> whence we may inferr, that that part of Logick which teaches us how to <hi>distinguish</hi> them <hi>accurately,</hi> and to <hi>keep them distinct,</hi> is of exceeding great use; and that the Study of it is to be earnestly pursu'd by all Pretenders to <hi>Science;</hi> especially by new Beginners: Of which, I hope, I have elaborately treated in the First Book of my <hi>Method.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In order to the 12th. Chapter; there is no doubt but that we can <hi>unite seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral simpler Ideas or Notions into one,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">All <hi>Complex</hi> Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, or Notions, must consist of <hi>simpler</hi> ones, united in the <hi>Thing.</hi>
                  </note> and signify them by <hi>one Name;</hi> but I deny that, if we conjoin them otherwise than as they are, or <hi>may</hi> be, <hi>united in External Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> or in the <hi>Thing,</hi> we can have any Complex <hi>Notions,</hi> tho' we may have a Fancy, of them, or a kind of <hi>Imitation</hi> of some thing which once af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected our Senses. For, since I cannot but think I have demonstrated that our <hi>Notion</hi> is the <hi>Thing</hi> as conceiv'd by us, or the Thing existing in the understanding; If I have any Complexion of more Simple Notions in my <hi>Mind,</hi> not found to be united in the <hi>Thing;</hi> the <hi>Idea</hi> in my Mind is
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:95549:104"/>
not conformable to the <hi>Thing</hi> it self, nor is it, as I have prov'd it to be, <hi>that Thing;</hi> and then to what end should I have such an <hi>Idea,</hi> as if I come to predicate it of the Thing, the Proposition would be False, which consequently would fill our mind with Falshoods. Next, as has been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten prov'd formerly, I deny the Soul can <hi>Unite</hi> or <hi>Act</hi> of her self, or by her peculiar power (tho' the <hi>Man</hi> may) but is oblig'd to take what's given her by Impressions on the Seat of Knowledge. In which case, what the <hi>Thing</hi> or <hi>Object,</hi> by a Genuin Impression, gives her, is <hi>Orderly, Solid,</hi> and a Seed of <hi>true</hi> knowledge or <hi>Science;</hi> but that which the <hi>Fancy</hi> gives her, <hi>otherwise than</hi> as the Thing did directly imprint it, is Disorderly, Superficial, and a Ground of <hi>Errour.</hi> Indeed, she is forc'd to <hi>apprehend,</hi> whenever the Phantasms strike the Seat of Knowledge, tho' their Motions and Complexions be never so Disorderly, or even Monstrous. Now, whenever this is done, <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> Men direct their Eye to the <hi>Thing,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whether the Conjunction of such or such <hi>Ideas,</hi> is truly found <hi>in re;</hi> or is agreeable to those <hi>Direct</hi> Impressions it had received <hi>thence;</hi> which if it be, the Soul entertains it, after Examination, and lets it <hi>sink</hi> into her; it being the <hi>true nature</hi> of the Thing, and so a <hi>Ground to Truth,</hi> to see which her Essence was made; If it be not, she rejects it; for it grounds a Contradiction to the Nature of the Thing, which is the only Ground of Truth; and makes or counterfeits it to <hi>be</hi> what it <hi>is not;</hi> and it is directly <hi>against</hi> her Nature to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Contradictory Judgments. Now, what <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> Men, by their recourse to the Thing, thus <hi>reject,</hi> those <hi>Unskilful Thinkers,</hi> who are led by
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95549:104"/>
                  <hi>Fancy,</hi> do <hi>admit;</hi> and by this means their Souls become full of Phantastick Conceits which never can be brought to any Coherence or Connexion of Terms. For no Terms can <hi>Cohere,</hi> unless the <hi>Notions</hi> meant by each of them be really in the <hi>Thing it self;</hi> and those Coherences made in the Mind by any other way, or of any other Materials, are far from <hi>Solid</hi> or <hi>True,</hi> as we experience in People that are <hi>Splenetick</hi> or <hi>Enthusiaistck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Wherefore, whenever the <hi>Ideas</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected otherwise than they are or may be <hi>in re,</hi> the Object of that <note place="margin">Otherwise they are <hi>Groundless Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi>

Whence the Objects of those Fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Acts is some <hi>non-Ens</hi> taken for an <hi>Ens;</hi> which, if pursu'd home by a good Logician, must end in a Contradiction. For example, I can have Notions of <hi>Hircus</hi> and <hi>Ceruus</hi> aparted from one another; but, if I will unite them in my Mind <hi>otherwise</hi> than Nature exhibited them, and take them <hi>conjoyntly,</hi> (as Fancy may) and frame a a Complex <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Hirco-Ceruus,</hi> or <hi>Goat-Stag,</hi> it must needs be perfectly Fantastical and Chimerical. This will farther appear, if we take one of Mr. <hi>L</hi>'s <hi>Complex Ideas,</hi> viz. <hi>Beauty, consisting of a certain Composition of Figure and Colour.</hi> Now, if such Figure and Colour had not been found, or <hi>might not be</hi> found <hi>united by Nature</hi> in the same <hi>Thing,</hi> the <hi>Idea</hi> of it could not have been conformable to what's in Nature, or the <hi>Idea</hi> of any <hi>Reality,</hi> but purely <hi>Fantastical</hi> and <hi>Counterfeit.</hi> The same may be said of his <hi>Idea</hi> of Lead, with its proper Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;

or <hi>of the Ordinary Idea of a Man,</hi> describ'd here to be a <hi>Substance</hi> or Thing with <hi>Motion, Thought</hi> and <hi>Reasoning</hi> join'd to it: Which Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, were they not <hi>join'd</hi> in the <hi>Thing</hi> they belong to, or <hi>identify'd</hi> with it, the Complex <hi>Ideas</hi> of them would be nothing but meer <hi>Groundless Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Point is so Important, that it will deserve to be clear'd as perfectly as possible: I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore allow it a more elaborate Explanation, tho' I spend less Pains and Time in my other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions.</p>
               <p>When I consider an Individual Thing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>(v. g.</hi> A <hi>Man)</hi> according to the Notion of <hi>Being,</hi> I have <note place="margin">The Manner how all <hi>Complex Ideas</hi> or <hi>Notions</hi> are made, elaborately explain'd.</note> two Notions of him, <hi>viz.</hi> That he is <hi>capable of Existing,</hi> and that he <hi>actually Exists;</hi> the former of which he has by means of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> Causes, which, by Determining the Matter, gives him his Determinate Nature or Essence. The other he has <hi>immediately</hi> from the <hi>First Being;</hi> and I have a <hi>Complex</hi> Notion of him accordingly. Next, considering the same thing precisely as a <hi>Body,</hi> or such an <hi>Ens</hi> as we call by that Name; I find in it somewhat by which it is <hi>Corruptible,</hi> or <hi>Changeable into another,</hi> and somewhat by which it is <hi>Determin'd to be This</hi> sort of Thing, or Body, <hi>or to be what it is:</hi> And, I conceive and call Body according to the former of these Considerations <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Matter;</hi> and, according to the later, <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Form;</hi> and I frame a <hi>Complex Idea</hi> of it, as 'tis a <hi>Body</hi> accordingly. Hitherto I treat of the Thing as a Metaphysician, and regard it only according to some Order it has to <hi>Being.</hi> Proceeding fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95549:105"/>
on, and dividing still the common Line of <hi>Ens,</hi> or (what I am now arriv'd at) <hi>[Body]</hi> by <hi>Intrinsecal</hi> Differences, or by <hi>more</hi> and <hi>less</hi> of the Generical Notion, of which Quantity or Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is the Primary Affection, or that of which all the other Modes are made; I find that some Bodies must be <hi>more</hi> Divisible or <hi>Rare,</hi> other <hi>less</hi> Divisible or <hi>Dense;</hi> and by this means we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach something nearer to <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Physical</hi> Considerations of that thing as 'tis call'd <hi>Body;</hi> and the Science that treats of it, as being <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately under</hi> Metaphysicks, and <hi>immediately above</hi> Physicks, may not unfitly be called <hi>Archi-Physical;</hi> as giving the immediate <hi>Principles</hi> to Physicks! This way of Considering <hi>Body</hi> grounds the Notions of <hi>Simple</hi> Bodies, called <hi>Elements;</hi> which differ in Nothing but <hi>Rarity</hi> and <hi>Density;</hi> and also, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Compound</hi> Bodies made up of those Simple ones. So that now my former Complex Notions of <hi>Capable to be</hi> and <hi>Actual Being;</hi> and, of having De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate and Indeterminate Respects to that <hi>Ens</hi> as it is <hi>Body,</hi> call'd <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Matter,</hi> has annext to it in the Thing many <hi>Secondary</hi> Qualities, made up of those <hi>Primary</hi> ones; such as are, Heat and Cold, Moisture and Driness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so we are come to that Science call'd <hi>Physicks</hi> or <hi>Natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy;</hi> and my former Complex Notion of such an <hi>Individuum,</hi> takes in these <hi>Second</hi> Qualities, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and above what it contain'd before.

Moreover, we can find in this <hi>Sensitive</hi> Thing, or this <hi>Animal</hi> now spoken of, both as to its <hi>peculiar</hi> Matter and Form, a Disposition to work <hi>comparatively;</hi> that is to <hi>judge,</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> or <hi>discourse;</hi> and, consequently, to have in it a <hi>Knowing</hi> Power, which is to be a <hi>Man:</hi> And, Lastly, Such a <hi>peculiar Degree</hi> of this Power of <hi>Comparing,</hi> which restrains the <hi>Specifick</hi> Notion of <hi>Man</hi> to be <hi>this Individual</hi> Man. So that, by this time, such a Vast Assembly of Modes or Accidents (the Croud of which make that <hi>most Complex</hi> Notion, call'd the <hi>Suppositum,</hi> so blindly <hi>confused)</hi> do meet in my Complex <hi>Idea</hi> of this Individual Man, that, tho' I see he is a <hi>Thing;</hi> and a <hi>Distinct</hi> Thing, because I see he <hi>exists</hi> and <hi>operates</hi> Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently of all <hi>other</hi> Things; yet, I can have no Distinct and Clear Notion of his <hi>Essence,</hi> but by taking it in pieces, (as it were,) both as to those several Considerations belonging to him, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Line of <hi>Being,</hi> as was now explain'd; and also, as to those Conceptions I make of him, according to all the Physical <hi>Modes</hi> or Accidents which are in him: Which <hi>Modes,</hi> so to gain an exacter Knowledge of him, as Affected with those Modes, (and the same may be said of all other Things,) we divide, and sub-divide, as we see agreeable to their Distinct Natures or Notions.</p>
               <p>This Discourse may, if well weigh'd, be, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps useful for many Ends. But, to apply it to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:95549:106"/>
our present purpose: All this Multitude of <hi>less Complex,</hi> or <hi>more simple Ideas,</hi> belonging to the Line of Substance, are found Connected in this <hi>Individuum;</hi> and, did we <hi>add</hi> the least of them by <hi>our Mind,</hi> which was not found Conjoin'd in the <hi>Thing,</hi> my Notion or <hi>Idea</hi> of him would, so far, be <hi>Fantastick,</hi> and <hi>False;</hi> because there was nothing found in the <hi>Thing</hi> that answers to such a Complexion, (only which can make it <hi>Real,)</hi> but only in my <hi>Fancy,</hi> counterfeiting such a Complexion, and mis-informing my <hi>Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> as it happens in the Illusive Representations, made in those who are troubled with the Spleen, Melancholy, or Phrenzy; as likewise, in time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous People, when they think they see Sprights; or in Horses, when they boggle. Add, that the Mind cannot, <hi>of its self,</hi> begin to act, (as was proved formerly:) but all New Acts, or Excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Former Notions in her, are the Acts of the <hi>whole Man,</hi> and must naturally arise <hi>first</hi> from the <hi>Bodily</hi> Part, or the <hi>Fancy;</hi> either Imprinting Phantasms, which it receives from the Objects, <hi>orderly</hi> and <hi>genuinly,</hi> on the Seat of Knowledge; or <hi>Disorderly,</hi> as its Irregular and Extravagant Motions happen to conjoyn them. Whence we say that a Man who does not correct such inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Connexions by <hi>Judgment,</hi> is <hi>led by Fancy,</hi> or <hi>Caprichious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. While we are discoursing about the manner how we come by all our <hi>Ideas</hi> whether <hi>Simple</hi> or <hi>Complex,</hi> it <note place="margin">How the Doctrine of <hi>Cartesius,</hi> Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> and <hi>J.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95549:107"/>
differ. The <hi>Cartesians</hi> do not own themselves at all beholding to <hi>outward Objects</hi> for their <hi>Ideas</hi> (as least, as some of them say, for the chiefest ones) but they say they are <hi>Innate,</hi> or imprinted on the Soul by Gods immediate hand; tho' some of them (which makes the matter much worse) chose rather to say they are <hi>Elicited</hi> or <hi>produced</hi> by the Soul it self, upon such a Motion from without; as also, that they are <hi>re-excited</hi> by such <hi>Motions;</hi> in which last Tenet Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> seems to agree with them. But this Learned Author denies all <hi>Innate Ideas;</hi> and holds that the <hi>Simple</hi> ones (at least) are caused by the Objects, whether they be Internal or External; but, that the <hi>Complex Ideas</hi> are fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Mind, which he conceives to have a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Compounding them as she pleases. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, my Principles force me to oppose them both, and to hold That all <hi>Ideas,</hi> whether <hi>Simple,</hi> or <hi>Complex</hi> (provided that by <hi>Ideas</hi> be meant <hi>Notions,</hi> and not <hi>Imaginations)</hi> are to be taken intirely from the Objects or Things in <hi>Nature;</hi> as also that, when we excite them a <hi>new,</hi> something that is <hi>in Act</hi> it self must cause that Action; because a meer <hi>Power</hi> to do any Thing, (whether <hi>in</hi> the Soul or <hi>out</hi> of it) cannot <hi>determin it self</hi> to any Action in <hi>particular.</hi> And, if I may freely and impartially pass my Verdict between them, I should frankly declare, that Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s way has far <hi>more of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in it, and consequently is <hi>more Solid</hi> than the <hi>Cartesian;</hi> in regard he holds all our <hi>Ideas</hi> are ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally taken from the <hi>Outward Objects,</hi> either <hi>emmediately,</hi> as to his <hi>Simple Ideas;</hi> or <hi>mediately,</hi> as to those which are compounded of them by the Soul: Whereas the <hi>Cartesians</hi> cannot pretend to know any thing in Nature, unless they can
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:95549:107"/>
solidly prove these three Previous Points: <hi>First,</hi> That their <hi>Ideas</hi> are <hi>Innate,</hi> or else <hi>produced</hi> by the Soul; neither of which I am certain they can ever prove. <hi>Secondly, What</hi> those <hi>Ideas</hi> are, or that they are not <hi>meer Fancies. Thirdly,</hi> If they put them to be meer <hi>Representations,</hi> and not the <hi>Thing,</hi> or Object it self, how we can be certain that we must <hi>by them</hi> know the Things without vs, notwithstanding all that I have alledg'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the contrary in my Second and Third <hi>Preliminaries.</hi> If these Points, which are the main Hinges that open us the way into Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, or the <hi>Knowledge of Things,</hi> be not <hi>first</hi> firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly establish'd, all their Discourses, tho' they be never so ingenious, must be <hi>hollow</hi> and <hi>superficial</hi> for want of <hi>Solid Ground.</hi> These three Points, I say, they must either show to be <hi>self-evident,</hi> or they must <hi>make</hi> them Evident by <hi>Demonstrating</hi> them; or else, I am sure, 'tis <hi>most Evident,</hi> that all their Superstructures are <hi>Ruinous</hi> for want of a <hi>Firm Foundation.</hi> I would not misunderstand them, when they explain to us what their <hi>Ideas</hi> are; and yet they have such a peculiar Talent of speaking Ambiguous Sense in seemingly plain Words, that I cannot for my Heart comprehend their Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They tell us sometimes they <hi>hold</hi> the <hi>Idea,</hi> consider'd <hi>Objectively,</hi> to be the <hi>Res</hi> or <hi>Thing</hi> itself; but when they add, that it is the <hi>Res</hi> or Thing <hi>[quatenus representata]</hi> they seem to deny it again; for the Words <hi>[quatenus representata]</hi> signifie, in true Logick, the bare <hi>Representation</hi> of the Thing; as <hi>[Paries quatenus Albus,]</hi> means <hi>[Albedo;]</hi> the restrictive Word <hi>[Quatenus]</hi> cutting off the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Notion to which it is annex'd, from <hi>all others.</hi> And how odd a piece of Chiquanery it is to say,

that the <hi>Picture</hi> or Resemblance of <hi>Caesar,</hi> is <hi>Caesar</hi> himself, <hi>quatenus representatus,</hi> I leave it to others to judge. Besides, if the thing it self be <hi>really there,</hi> or in the Knowing Power, it may be <hi>known</hi> without more ado, or without needing those lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Spiritual Epicycles,</hi> (if I may so call them) those useless <hi>Ideas.</hi> Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> I must confess, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at first to build Solidly on the <hi>Things;</hi> but, he is so very acutely and speculatively attentive to the <hi>Ideas</hi> in his own Thoughts, and so wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with Contemplation of them, that he seems sometimes to <hi>over-run</hi> his own Principles, (which only at first he intended to pursue) and quite to <hi>lose Sight</hi> of the <hi>Things.</hi> Whereas I bend my whole Endeavour to keep my Eye steadily upon them through the whole Course of my Doctrine, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermingling any gratuitous Suppositions, or suffering my self to be led astray from the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Things</hi> by any ill-grounded <hi>Fancies</hi> of my own, which would court and debauch my Reason, tho' they seem never so Ingenious.</p>

Meaning of the Words he uses; for it seems evident to me, that this Explication of Extension is meerly Voluntary and Preternatural; and seems (tho' perfectly Groundless it self) to be laid as a Ground for <hi>Vacuum;</hi> and, therefore, his Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences drawn thence, want Premisses.

lead us into very great Errours.

Farther, to imagine <hi>Space,</hi> that is <hi>not Extended,</hi> is a perfect Contradiction, tho' not in the very Terms, yet by an Easie and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Consequence. For, putting a Body to be in <hi>such</hi> a Space, it must be commensurate to such a <hi>Part</hi> of it; otherwise, that Body might take up <hi>all</hi> Space; and must do so, were it not Commensurate to some <hi>part</hi> of it <hi>only:</hi> And to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95549:110"/>
fancy a Thing <hi>Commensurate</hi> to the Parts of what is <hi>extended,</hi> and it self not to be Extended <hi>likewise,</hi> is a most extravagant Conceit, and a plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. Again, If a Body take up but <hi>one part</hi> of Space, and not <hi>another</hi> part of it, <hi>(v. g.</hi> that part which is next it, or in which it is,) <hi>Space</hi> must not only have <hi>Parts,</hi> but also one Part <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> Another; which is the very Notion of <hi>Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> Lastly, Since <hi>Imaginary Space</hi> is put to be Vast, and even Infinite, it cannot consist in an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible;</hi> wherefore, it must necessarily be Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and <hi>Diffused,</hi> that is, <hi>Extended:</hi> Whence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that, to fancy Body to be put in such a <hi>Space,</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> (for he grants here, §. 11. that these two <hi>Ideas</hi> differ but in a certain Respect,) and yet not <hi>shove</hi> aside or <hi>remove</hi> those Extended Parts <hi>out of</hi> that Space, is to make the Extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Parts of that <hi>Space,</hi> and of the Body in it, to be <hi>within one another,</hi> or <hi>penetrated;</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Contradiction. Now, if they be not Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated, one of them must necessarily <hi>drive</hi> the other out of the <hi>Space</hi> it occupates; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Parts of that <hi>Space</hi> must be <hi>Separable, Moveable,</hi> and <hi>Resistent,</hi> as those of <hi>Body</hi> are; they being, in very deed, the <hi>self-same.</hi>

its Conception, by which 'tis distinguish'd from those others.

Or, if he means, he cannot have a Notion of any thing so great, but a greater may be still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd; then I answer, <hi>First,</hi> That our Conception cannot make or prove that <hi>to be,</hi> which <hi>is not. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> That none can, indeed, possibly have such a Notion (by <hi>his</hi> way) of <hi>either</hi> of them; but by <hi>our</hi> way very easily; for, by adding a Negation to <hi>Finite,</hi> as 'tis manifest we may, we may have a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Infinite,</hi> which <hi>sets Bounds</hi> to all Imaginable Quantities, since none can pretend to <hi>imagine</hi> any thing <hi>beyond Infinity.</hi> The same way gives us the plain Notion of <hi>Immensity,</hi> by joining a Negation to <hi>Measurableness.</hi> Indeed, the Notion of <hi>Eternity</hi> can be explicated neither way; neither by repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or adding <hi>Ideas,</hi> nor by a Negation of Finite Time, compounding an Infinite Time, to which
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:95549:113"/>
it may be conceiv'd <hi>Commensurable:</hi> For, to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,</hi> is to <hi>be;</hi> and, tho' <hi>our</hi> Duration, which is accompany'd with perpetual Alterations and Changes, is therefore <hi>subject to Time,</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurable to such and such Portions of it; yet <hi>God</hi>'s Duration is of a far more Sovereign Nature. Let us reflect, when we say, <hi>God was from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> what those Words can mean. <hi>Infinite Time</hi> neither <hi>was,</hi> nor <hi>can be;</hi> and therefore, to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Eternity by what neither <hi>was,</hi> nor <hi>can be,</hi> is to explicate it by an Impossibility, which is to make it <hi>Inexplicable.</hi> Time <hi>was not</hi> before the World, <hi>in re;</hi> nor in <hi>our</hi> Understanding, for <hi>we were not</hi> yet; nor in <hi>God</hi>'s, for he, being Truth it self, cannot know any thing to <hi>be actually,</hi> when as yet it <hi>was not.</hi> Wherefore, since Eternity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be explicated by any Regard to <hi>possible Time,</hi> it is left that it must be explicated by what the Word <hi>[Duration]</hi> imports, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Being;</hi> and so it must consist in the highest <hi>Impossibility of Not Being,</hi> which naturally follows from the Notion of <hi>Self-Existence.</hi> Tho' I doubt not but those who are not got above Fancy, are as hard put to it, not to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a long Flux of <hi>Time before the World;</hi> as they are, not to imagine a vast Expansion of Empty Space <hi>beyond the World.</hi> And so it must happen, till <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of Terms</hi> (in which only, and not in the <hi>Fancy, Truth</hi> is to be found) comes to govern Men's Thoughts, and establish their Judgments.</p>

                  </hi> and yet, out of the profound and dutiful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence I bear to his Wisdom, Goodness and Power, I must declare, it is my Tenet, that he cannot; any more than he can witness a Falshood, or be liable to any other Imperfection. It will be thought this limits, and consequently takes away his <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency:</hi> And I, on the contrary, think I have far more Reason to judge, that the <hi>other</hi> Opinion argues <hi>Impotency,</hi> and <hi>ours settles</hi> his <hi>Omnipotency.</hi> Common Sense seems to tell us, that Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is a <hi>Power of doing all things,</hi> and not of <hi>doing Nothing.</hi> To Act, is to do <hi>something;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to <hi>do Nothing,</hi> or <hi>make a Nothing,</hi> (which the Sense of Annihilation,) is, <hi>not to do:</hi> And, 'tis a strange Notion of Omnipotency, which puts it to consist (in such an Occasion) in not <hi>doing.</hi> I wonder what Conceit such Discoursers make of the <hi>Divinity.</hi> What I am forc'd to conceive of him, as Essential to him, is, that he is a <hi>Pure Actuality of Being,</hi> (as far as is on his part,) <hi>actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ever exercised;</hi> that he has no Power in him <hi>Undetermin'd to act,</hi> as we have; which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues some Potentiality, or <hi>Imperfection</hi> in us.

is a <hi>perpetual Creation,</hi> or <hi>Creation continued;</hi> and, therefore, that 'tis more Diametrically opposite to his Nature, to cause <hi>Not being,</hi> than it is for Light to cause Darkness.

Since then the Essences of all Creatures are <hi>Capacities of Being,</hi> the same Goodness that makes the <hi>Sun shine on the Just and Unjust,</hi> must give them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to <hi>be actually.</hi> The Place is not proper to prove this Point at large; but, were I writing Metaphysicks, and were oblig'd to handle it throughly, I should not doubt, but to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate from the Natures of Action, Effect, Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality, the Specification of Action, from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Creatures, and almost each of <hi>God</hi>'s Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Attributes, that <hi>Annihilation</hi> is both Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and also most unworthy the Divine Nature.

He knows how many Days make a Month, how many Months a Year, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He esteems all these, however he <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides</hi> them into <hi>lesser,</hi> or by Addition <hi>augments</hi> them into <hi>greater,</hi> to be <hi>Parts of Time;</hi> and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, Parts of the <hi>Sun's Motion,</hi> as well as
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95549:116"/>
he knew that a <hi>Day</hi> was such. If then they know that all <hi>particular Parts</hi> of the Sun's Motion are <hi>particular Parts</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> let us abstract from all these <hi>Particulars,</hi> and the Motion of the Sun, <hi>in Common,</hi> is the Common Notion of <hi>Time</hi> it self <hi>in reality;</hi> however the <hi>Formal</hi> Notion of <hi>Time</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in this, that it be <hi>Known</hi> and <hi>Regular,</hi> (as the Sun's Motion is, as far as they can discern,) so that they can measure and adjust all their Actions by it, which 'tis evident they may. And this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of Time they do know <hi>too;</hi> as appears by using or applying Hours, Days, Months, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to measure and adjust all their Motions or Actions by them. So that this whole Discourse of mine, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering the Niceties objected, which escap'd the Observation of the Vulgar, seems to be built on that Solid Maxim, that <hi>The true Signification or Sense of the Words is to be taken from the Common Usage of them.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> pleases (as I think he will not) to coin Another <hi>Idea</hi> of it, and call it <hi>Time,</hi> he may if he pleases; but it will not be the Notion of <hi>Time</hi> which Men have had hitherto; nor will his <hi>new</hi> Notion sute with the Sense of <hi>Mankind;</hi> nor is it possible the Signification he imposes upon that Word can ever obtain Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the World, unless some Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which commands all the World, should enjoin, under great Penalties, that such a Word be taken in that <hi>new</hi> Sense, and no other; and even that will never be; for all Mankind will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be under any such Authority.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. I deny that his Argument, drawn from our not perceiving Duration when we sleep, does conclude that this <note place="margin">Our not Perceiving Duration when we Sleep no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it.</note> Successive Train of <hi>Ideas</hi> gives us, or <hi>is</hi> the Notion of our Duration. For, none can think he <hi>endures not,</hi> whether he <hi>perceives</hi> it or no; or that our Duration <hi>ceases,</hi> or is interrupted, tho' he <hi>thinks not</hi> of it; or that its being <hi>longer</hi> or <hi>shorter</hi> depends on our having <hi>Attention</hi> to those <hi>Ideas,</hi> but on its Correspondence to <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> of the Sun's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Nor, had we endur'd <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less,</hi> or been a Jot more or less <hi>Old,</hi> whether we had <hi>wak'd</hi> or <hi>slept</hi> all our Life-time.

               <p n="5">5. I deny also, that the Idea or Notion of <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> comes by <hi>Reflexion</hi> on our <hi>Train of Ideas:</hi> Because <hi>Experience</hi>

Direct Impression from Outward Objects, which we <hi>see</hi> move or succeed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I deny absolutely, that, tho' all that's said be wav'd, a <hi>Train of our Ideas</hi> can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a <hi>proper Cause</hi> of the Notion <note place="margin">And against the Nature of <hi>Things,</hi> and of <hi>Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances</hi> too.</note> of Succession, or <hi>represent</hi> it: For Succession or Motion has, of it self, no <hi>distinguishable,</hi> much less <hi>Actually distinct</hi> Parts, any more than <hi>Permanent</hi> Quantity, or Extension has any Nicks or Notches to butt, bound, determin or distinguish it here and there; but they both proceed in one Even, Confus'd and Undistinguishable Tenour; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the Train of <hi>Ideas,</hi> each <hi>Idea</hi> is <hi>actually Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi> from the other. Whence the Notion of such a Succession ought to be <hi>One continued Idea,</hi> or the Idea of a <hi>Continuance,</hi> or else it resembles not the Thing as it is in Nature; nor consequently, is it a Similitude or <hi>Idea</hi> of the Thing, or outward Object; that is, 'tis no <hi>Idea</hi> at all, nor so much as a good <hi>Phantasm;</hi> much less is it a <hi>Notion,</hi> or the Thing <hi>so in</hi> the Understanding, <hi>as</hi> it is out <hi>of it.</hi> Whence I must utterly deny what he says here, §. 6. that <hi>Motion produces in the Mind an Idea of Succession,</hi> any otherwise, <hi>than as it produces there a continued train of Distinguishable Ideas.</hi> For, <hi>Distinction</hi> can never represent that which is essentially <hi>Indistinct,</hi> as Succession is: Or, if he means the <hi>Interval's</hi> between the Appearances of one <hi>Idea,</hi> and another are Indistinct and Confused, it will be ask't by what <hi>Idea</hi> this Indistinct <hi>Interval</hi> is made known to us; and why the same <hi>Idea</hi> may not as connaturally be imprinted by the <hi>Motion</hi> of Bodies in Nature; the Succession of which our Eyes, Ears, and Touch, do testify?</p>

                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:95549:118"/>
7. I must deny too that <hi>Duration</hi> (as he takes it) and <hi>Succession</hi> cannot one of them be a <hi>Measure</hi> to the other. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>One</hi> Motion, if <hi>Known</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,</hi> may and must be a Measure to <hi>another.</hi>
                  </note> For, all that can be conceiv'd of the Notion of <hi>Duration</hi> (besides <hi>Being)</hi> fitting it to be a <hi>Measure,</hi> is some <hi>Designed</hi> Part of <hi>Motion</hi> or <hi>Succession:</hi> And, when two things <hi>move,</hi> that which moves <hi>more regularly</hi> (provided it be <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently knowable,</hi> and its Quantity some way or other <hi>Determin'd)</hi> is in all points fitted to be the <hi>Measure</hi> of the others Motion. Nor is it more difficult to measure the <hi>less</hi> Regular Motion by the <hi>More</hi> Regular one, if the other requisites be not wanting, than 'tis to measure the Extended Quantity of a <hi>Permanent</hi> Body, <hi>v. g.</hi> a Yard of Cloth (which as found in the Piece is <hi>Undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd)</hi> by a <hi>yard-wand,</hi> whose Quantity is Stated and <hi>determin'd.</hi> For Example, when I write or walk <hi>an hour,</hi> the Motion of Sand in an Hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glass, which is <hi>more known</hi> and Determinate, <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> the Motions of my Pen or Legs, whose Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Quantity or Motion is <hi>less</hi> certainly known or Determinate than the other is. And, as <hi>that</hi> Determinate Motion measures the <hi>other,</hi> so the Motion of the Sun, which is <hi>knowable</hi> to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind (which the Glass was not) and, to their apprehension, <hi>Regular,</hi> brought to Proportionate and Determinate parts by help of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, is apt to <hi>measure all</hi> our Motions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; which Measure we call <hi>Time,</hi> as I think, Mr. <hi>L.</hi> grants. Whence I deny that <hi>Time is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd by the Motion of the Sun</hi> (as Mr. <hi>L.</hi> objects, and justly <hi>wonders</hi> at) for <hi>it is that very Motion,</hi> fitted, as is now said, to be a Common Measure
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:95549:118"/>
to all others. He mentions many other Signes or Marks of Periods supposed Equidistant, as the Returning of Birds at such Seasons, the Ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Fruit, or Fire <hi>lighted up at the same distance of Time, increast in Heat, &amp;c.</hi> but what must mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the distance between those Periods? Or, what's this to <hi>our</hi> Time as <hi>it is now.</hi> St. <hi>Austin</hi> was puzzled to know, whether, if <hi>Rota figuli moveretur,</hi> and all things else stood still, there would in that Case be <hi>Time or no.</hi> But all these Extravagant Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions are frivolous. Mankind takes their Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from things <hi>as they are,</hi> and as they work upon their <hi>Senses;</hi> which, in our case, is the Regular and Known Motion of the <hi>Sun;</hi> and they take the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of its <hi>parts,</hi> from the Designation, Division and Multiplication, made by our Understanding; and not from wild Suppositions, which neither come home to the Point, nor <hi>are, ever were,</hi> or <hi>shall be;</hi> nor <hi>are,</hi> or <hi>could</hi> be so Regular and Knowable to all Mankind, as this Motion of the Sun is.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I must absolutely deny, and moreover think it a most Extraordinary position, to affirm that we must not judge <note place="margin">There is no shew of Reason that the <hi>Equality</hi> of the <hi>Periods of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> can <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly</hi> be taken from the <hi>Train of our Ideas.</hi>
                  </note> that the Periods of Duration are equal, by the Motion of the Sun, but by the Train of Ideas that passed in Men's minds in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals; which, I conceive, is the Sense of his §. 21. and §. 12. and of the Tenour of his Discourse in divers places. For, first, how does it appear that the Motion of the Train of those <hi>Ideas</hi> is it self <hi>Equal,</hi> or <hi>near Equal,</hi> in any one or the <hi>same</hi> Man at all times; without which we cannot know by <hi>their Equal succession</hi> that the Periods which
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95549:119"/>
they are to <hi>measure</hi> are Equal, When a Man is in a <hi>stupid</hi> Humour, his Thoughts play very <hi>little</hi> and <hi>slowly;</hi> when he is sound <hi>a-sleep,</hi> not <hi>at all;</hi> when Awake and Brisk, or <hi>agitated</hi> by some great Passion, they move <hi>very swiftly;</hi> when sedate and compos'd, more <hi>moderately;</hi> so that 'tis impossible to fix the succession of those Ideas in any <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity.</hi> Next, how can we know that those <hi>Ideas</hi> move <hi>regularly,</hi> and not rather very differently, in <hi>diverse</hi> Men? Contemplative, Melancholly and Dull Men use to <hi>fix</hi> their Mind long <hi>upon one</hi> Thought; and, consequently, upon <hi>one Object</hi> of their Thought, or <hi>one Idea:</hi> Whereas those who are endow'd with Gayity of <hi>Wit,</hi> (which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

For want of which, and for the Reasons late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given, perhaps no two Men in the World could agree, or come to a right Understanding with one another, about the <hi>Time</hi> of their Actions, which would put all the World in Confusion
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95549:119"/>
about their Common affairs. Lastly, Mr. <hi>L.</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes no Reason to evince the <hi>Regular</hi> succession of his <hi>Ideas</hi> in his §. 9. which seems the proper place to assert that Principal Point upon which all his Discourse depends; and he only says, that he <hi>guesses that the Appearance of the Ideas va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not very much in a waking Man;</hi> and that they <hi>seem</hi> to have <hi>certain Bounds</hi> in their <hi>Quickness</hi> and <hi>Slowness.</hi> And the Reason he gives afterwards, §. 10. for this (as he calls it) <hi>odd conjecture,</hi> is easy to be solv'd by our Principles: For, there is no doubt but that some short time must be allow'd for the coming of Impressions from without, for the ferrying them over the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and the Re-exciting them in the Fancy, by which Notions are bred in our Mind; which a very quick Motion of the Outward Object may prevent, as in a Brand whirl'd round, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there must be also some Marks to make us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <hi>too slow</hi> Motions; Yet, between those two Extremes, there are so many Degrees, and such Variety intervene, that the Succession of those <hi>Ideas</hi> may nevertheless be very Uneven and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular. Rather, I may with better Reason, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that it is impossible it should be any way Regular <hi>at all;</hi> since their Succession depends on the <hi>Fancy</hi> (the most Irregular and Unconstant Faculty we have) applying the Material <hi>Ideas</hi> or Phantasms a-new to the Seat of Knowledge; which Application thousands of Causes may <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard,</hi> or <hi>accelerate.</hi> His Objections against the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of the Sun's Motion not being Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically such, is of no force. 'Tis sufficient that it be so Regular as serves our use to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and adjust our Actions by it; and the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:95549:120"/>
same may be Objected against one measuring Cloth by a Yard-wand, whose length is never Mathematically Exact.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Wherefore, Notwithstanding the respect I have for Mr. <hi>L.</hi> I cannot but think that such quivering Grounds as <note place="margin">This odd Tenet not positively <hi>asserted</hi> by Mr. <hi>L.</hi>
                  </note> these can never support his most unaccountable Opinion, §. 12. that <hi>The Constant and Regular Succession of Ideas in a Waking Man, are, as it were, the Measure and Standard of all other Successions.</hi> His own good Judgment saw well the weakness of his grounds; wherefore his clear Sincerity, and usual Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty would not suffer him to deliver <hi>assertively,</hi> and <hi>assuredly,</hi> what he saw was <hi>Uncertain;</hi> and therefore he propos'd it rather as a <hi>Paradox,</hi> or (he calls it) an <hi>odd Conjecture,</hi> than maintain'd it as a <hi>Position;</hi> however, the Conception being so <hi>New,</hi> he was tempted not to pretermit it wholly: In doing which too, I believe, he not so much gratify'd himself, as the Humor of most late Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers; who are far more addicted to value what's <hi>Quaint</hi> than what's <hi>Solid.</hi>

Hence (as I have noted above) Mr. <hi>L.</hi> alter'd the Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Word <hi>[Solidity,]</hi> to make way for an <hi>Unsolid Being,</hi> or an <hi>Empty Space,</hi> as also, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word <hi>[Extension,]</hi> which he would confine to <hi>Material</hi> Beings; and chose to make use of the Word <hi>[Space,]</hi> because it seem'd less to conno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Notion of <hi>Body,</hi> than <hi>Extension</hi> did. And, here, he rather chuses to make use of the Word <hi>[Expansion,]</hi> as if it were <hi>better,</hi> that is, <hi>Different</hi> from <hi>Extension.</hi> The Word is proper enough, for which I do not much blame him: Only, I must affirm, that no Wit, nor even <hi>Fancy</hi> of Man, can conceive or imagine any thing, existing any where but in the <hi>Imagination,</hi> (or, even scarcely <hi>there,)</hi> to be <hi>Expanded,</hi> but it must also be <hi>really Extended;</hi> nor to be <hi>Extended,</hi> but it must be <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible;</hi> and, therefore, its Parts <hi>Separable</hi> by the intervening Body, (which he denies of his <hi>Inane,)</hi> unless we put them to be insuperably Hard, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, or Infractil, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> did his Atoms; or that, if they be thus Extended, and yet the Parts of the <hi>Inane</hi> do not <hi>separate,</hi> and give way to a new-come Body, there must not inevitably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Penetration of <hi>Extended Parts;</hi> that is, those
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:95549:121"/>
Parts that must be <hi>without one another,</hi> must be at the same time <hi>within one another;</hi> which is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Contradiction.</p>

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:95549:123"/>
Let us take then any <hi>Spiritual</hi> Mode or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, a <hi>Virtue</hi> for Example, and let it be that of <hi>Temperance;</hi> which done, let us ask our Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Thoughts, how <hi>Long, Broad,</hi> or <hi>Thick</hi> that Virtue is? Is it as little as a Barly-corn, or as big as a House? Is it a Yard in Length, or but an Inch? Is it as Thick as a Wall, or as Thin as a Wafer? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, Honest Nature would answer for us, that 'tis <hi>Nonsense</hi> to ask such a Question; its nature being perfectly of another kind, and utterly disagreeable to any of these Accidents. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, Let us ask what <hi>Colour</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> it is of? Is it <hi>Blew, Green,</hi> or <hi>Yellow?</hi> Is it <hi>Round, Four-square,</hi> or <hi>Triangular?</hi> Is it <hi>Rare</hi> or <hi>Dense, Hot, Cold, Moist,</hi> or <hi>Dry?</hi> And we shall discover that the Asker, if serious, would be look'd upon by all Mankind as a <hi>Fool</hi> or a <hi>Mad-man;</hi> such Qualities as these being as much Disparate from the Subject we are Enquiring about, as Knowledge is to a Beetle, or Science to a Mushrom. And yet, it would not be wonder'd at, that such Questions as these should be ask'd of any <hi>Body</hi> whatever. And what does this amount to, but that Nature assures us, by her free and sober Acknowledgment of it, that this <hi>Spiritual</hi> Mode, call'd <hi>Virtue</hi> or <hi>Temperance,</hi> is quite different from the whole Nature of <hi>Body,</hi> and from any <hi>Corporeal</hi> Thing that by our Senses ever enter'd into our <hi>Fancy.</hi> Since then this <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Mode or Accident has nothing at all to do with <hi>Body</hi> or its <hi>Modes,</hi> it is clearly evinced by the Ingenuous Confession of Unprejudiced Nature, that the <hi>Subject</hi> of it, which we call a <hi>Spirit,</hi> is so vastly removed from all we can say of <hi>Body (Being</hi> only excepted) that 'tis perfect Nonsense to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute any thing to it which we find in <hi>Corporeal</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:95549:124"/>

Since then we can truly say of <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Natures,</hi> that they are Long, Short, Diffus'd, Extended, Commensurate to one another in their Bulk, Motion, Duration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we must be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to <hi>deny</hi> all those of <hi>Spirits;</hi> and to Judge that they have nothing to do with any of these, nor can bear the having such <hi>Modes apply'd</hi> to them, or said of them, under Penalty of forfeiting our plainest Reason, and contradicting Common Sense. And, if it be such an Absurdity to apply them to <hi>Created Spirits,</hi> how much more absurd must it be to explicate <hi>God</hi>'s Eternity, Infinity, or Immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity by such <hi>gross Resemblances,</hi> or an Imaginary Order to the <hi>Short</hi> and <hi>Fleeting</hi> Natures of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Creatures?</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Lastly,</hi> to sum up all, I deny that the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Motion is taken from the continu'd <hi>Train of Distinguishable Ideas;</hi> and I affirm that it is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed by the Object <hi>without</hi> me, and is one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually successive and undistinguish'd <hi>Mode there</hi> as it is in the <hi>Thing.</hi> I deny too, that <hi>Duration</hi> is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or <hi>Succession,</hi> but only <hi>Being;</hi> tho' our <hi>Being</hi> (it being Unconstant and Fleeting) is accompany'd with <hi>Succession,</hi> and subject to Motion and Time; and <hi>commensurate</hi> to them, only (not as 'tis <hi>Being,</hi> but) as 'tis <hi>Fleeting,</hi> or perpetually <hi>Changing</hi> some way or other.

But this is parallel to that seducing <hi>Fancy</hi> that inveigled his Reason to hold a <hi>Vacuum;</hi> he took the Notion of <hi>Space</hi> from Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and then apply'd it to what was neither <hi>Spirit</hi> nor <hi>Body,</hi> but meer <hi>Nothing;</hi> and, <hi>here,</hi> he took his Notion of <hi>Duration,</hi> or Succession from <hi>Bodies moving;</hi> and when he has done, he would <hi>apply</hi> it to what's <hi>not Body</hi> (nor Spirit neither) nor Motion, nor like it, but contrary to it; that is, he would apply it to <hi>meer Nothing.</hi> I desire he would please to consider, that the Thing <hi>to which</hi> Another is <hi>Apply'd</hi> must exist <hi>as well as</hi> that which <hi>is Apply'd to</hi> it; and this <hi>antecedently</hi> to his Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of one to the other. Wherefore both Space and Duration being both <hi>Modes</hi> or <hi>Accidents,</hi> he must <hi>first prove,</hi> there is something beyond the World to which he can <hi>apply</hi> the Mode of <hi>Space;</hi> or something <hi>before the World,</hi> to which he can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Mode of <hi>Successive Duration,</hi> or it is perfect Nonsense even to <hi>talk</hi> of Applying <hi>one</hi> to the <hi>other.</hi> But this he has not done, and his way of attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting to do it seems to be this; first, he fancies he can apply those Modes to something <hi>there,</hi> and <hi>then;</hi> and thence concludes, there must be <hi>Things</hi> there to which they may be apply'd; as if his Fancy could create Entities at Pleasure, or to please

Nor matters it that we can apply <hi>stated Measures of Duration,</hi> and thence <hi>imagin Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration where nothing does really endure or exist,</hi> or by this means <hi>imagin to morrow, next Year, or seven Years hence;</hi> for we cannot apply them by our Reason, but only upon Supposition that they <hi>will exist,</hi> and then there <hi>will be</hi> also some <hi>Thing</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> supposed fit for them to be apply'd to; whereas an imaginary Space <hi>beyond the World,</hi> or <hi>imaginary</hi> Time or Succession <hi>before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> the World, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>is now,</hi> nor can there ever be any possible Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to which they <hi>can be Apply'd;</hi> and so the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of them can bear no manner of Sense.

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Prelim. 4. § 31, 32.</note> by joining the Sense of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb <hi>[Non]</hi> to that of <hi>[Finis:]</hi> And Mr. <hi>Locke, Ch.</hi> 17. §. 8. seems to come over to my Thoughts; where he says, that <hi>the Idea of Infinity seems to be pretty Clear, when we consider nothing in it but the Negation of an End.</hi> Whereas, on the other side, he grants, that <hi>the Idea of an Infinite Space or Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is very Obscure and Confused.</hi> Now, if the <hi>Clearness</hi> of an <hi>Idea</hi> be the greatest Perfection it can have, it follows, even from his own Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Infinity</hi> ought rather to be taken from the <hi>Negation</hi> of <hi>Finiteness,</hi> than from this Confus'd Way of <hi>Adding</hi> and <hi>Repeating</hi> more and more of Space or Duration. Add, that (as was said) this way can only give us the Idea of a <hi>Potential Infinity;</hi> nor that neither <hi>well,</hi> unless that <hi>Power</hi> to be Infinite could ever be reduc'd to <hi>Act,</hi> which is impossible it should: Now, the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> of <hi>Finiteness</hi> fully reaches an <hi>Actual</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute</hi> Infinity; and is applicable, and truly to be Predicated of <hi>God</hi> himself, and all his Intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Attributes, as Being, Duration, Power, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without needing any Recourse to the transitory and limited Natures or Modes of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to explicate it. Whereas, Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Infinite</hi> cannot be predicated of <hi>God,</hi> or his Attributes, <hi>at all:</hi> Nor can we say that <hi>God <hi>is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,</hi>
                  </hi> in <hi>his</hi> Sense of that Word; in regard he says, that <hi>our <hi>Idea</hi> of Infinity is (as he thinks) an Endless Growing Idea;</hi> For, the Infinity of <hi>God,</hi> and of all that can be conceiv'd to belong
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:95549:127"/>
to him, is incapable of <hi>Growth, Degrees,</hi> or <hi>Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> but is one <hi>Indivisible Being,</hi> without any possibility of our conceiving <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> in it, if we conceive it as we ought.</p>
               <p n="3">3. On the other side; How facil and natural is my Way of our gaining an <hi>Idea</hi> or Notion of <hi>Infinite?</hi> We see <note place="margin">And with what Ease.</note> most Things we converse with to be <hi>Limited,</hi> or <hi>Finite;</hi> wherefore, the Notion of the Thing <hi>as 'tis limited,</hi> or (which is the same) the Notion of <hi>Limitation</hi> or <hi>End,</hi> is very familiar and obvious to our Thoughts. Since then Experience teaches us that we can very easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly join a <hi>Negation</hi> to <hi>Finiteness</hi> or <hi>End</hi> when-ever we please, as well as we can to any other Notion; and, thence, have a kind of Complex Notion of <hi>Infinite,</hi> as well as we can of Immortal, Immense, Immaterial, Incorporeal, Indivisible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We have the Notion of <hi>Infinity</hi> given to our hands, without more ado; or without perplexing our selves with making use of those <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ame Helps of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> or <hi>Repeating</hi> those <hi>stinted Measures</hi> of Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Modes or Accidents, whose very <hi>Natures</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the <hi>Finite</hi> Number of Times we can only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them) do make them utterly Incapable ever to reach <hi>Actual,</hi> that is, <hi>True Infinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. As for the Question he introduces here, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Infinite</hi> be <hi>Positive,</hi> or <hi>Negative,</hi> or includes <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Notion of</hi> [In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite] <hi>is</hi> most perfectly Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note> something of <hi>both;</hi> my firm Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, That, however the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical way of expressing that Conception seems to be <hi>Negative,</hi> yet the <hi>Notion</hi> it self meant by that Word, is <hi>altogether Positive.</hi> My Reason is, because the <hi>Idea</hi> or Notion of <hi>Finis</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:95549:127"/>
or <hi>Limit</hi> (in what kind soever it be) does formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signifie <hi>[no farther</hi> in that kind,] which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>Negative:</hi> Wherefore, the Negation added to <hi>Finite,</hi> in the Word <hi>[Infinite,]</hi> quite <hi>taking off</hi> that Negative Sense which did before belong to the Word <hi>[Finite,]</hi> gives the Word <hi>[Infinite]</hi> a Sense purely <hi>Positive.</hi> Again, we can have no <hi>Direct Impression</hi> from the Thing; nor, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>Direct Notion</hi> of <hi>[Infinite,]</hi> nor, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, any <hi>Reflex</hi> Notion of it; for, all <hi>Reflex</hi> Notions have for their proper Object, the <hi>Direct</hi> ones which are already in our Minds: Wherefore, if the Notion of <hi>[Infinity]</hi> can be had any other way than by adding <hi>[Non]</hi> to <hi>[Finite,]</hi> it must come from our <hi>Reason</hi> finding out by <hi>Discourse,</hi> that there is a First and Self-existent Being, whose Essence and Attributes <hi>are</hi> beyond all Limits, or <hi>actually Infinite.</hi> Whence follows, that, since clear Reason demonstrates, that all <hi>Created</hi> Entities, and consequently, all the <hi>Modes</hi> belonging to them, are <hi>Finite,</hi> and <hi>only <hi>God</hi>
                  </hi> is <hi>Infinite</hi> in his Essence, and in all his Intrinsecal Attributes: And Reason also tells us, that all which is in <hi>God,</hi> (to whom only the Notion of <hi>Infinite</hi> can belong,) is most highly <hi>Positive;</hi> the same Reason teaches us to correct in our Thoughts the Grammatical Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveness of the Word <hi>[Infinite,]</hi> which can only be apply'd to <hi>Him;</hi> and to look upon it, and esteem it, as <hi>most perfectly Positive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. I cannot pass by, unreflected on, a Passage, §. 16. in which Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy imposes strangely upon his <note place="margin">

                  </note> Reason: He says, that <hi>Nothing is more unconceivable to him, than Duration, without Succession.</hi> What thinks he of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95549:128"/>
the <hi>Duration</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> in <note n="*" place="margin">James 1. 17.</note> whom is <hi>no Vicissitude, or Shadow of Change;</hi> (which Text, I believe, no Man, at least, no Christian, but holds to be <hi>Plain,</hi> and <hi>Literally True;)</hi> whereas, <hi>Succession</hi> is essentially <hi>perpetual Change?</hi> Let him please to reflect, that <hi>[To <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure</hi> so long,]</hi> is nothing else but <hi>[to <hi>be</hi> so long;]</hi> which done, by cutting off <hi>[so long]</hi> in both those Sayings, he will sind, that <hi>[To Endure,]</hi> is neither more, nor less, but simply <hi>[To be.]</hi> Whence his Conceit is so far from being <hi>True,</hi> that Nothing more wrongs <hi>Duration,</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi> than does <hi>Succession,</hi> or <hi>Motion.</hi> And, therefore, our Duration <hi>here,</hi> which is Unsteady, Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and Transitory, is justly reputed to be the <hi>worst</hi> sort of <hi>Duration,</hi> or <hi>Being;</hi> and the next to <hi>Not-Being,</hi> or <hi>Not-Enduring</hi> at all. Again, Common Sense tells us, that nothing moves meerly <hi>for Motion's sake;</hi> and, therefore, that all Motion is, to attain something which is <hi>Not-Motion,</hi> but the <hi>End</hi> of it, that is, <hi>Rest.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Eternal Rest,</hi> or that Duration called <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> is the End of <hi>all</hi> the Motion of the <hi>whole World;</hi> conformably to what the Holy Scripture, speaking of the State of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, tells us, that, <note n="*" place="margin">Apocal. cap. 1. v. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Tempus non erit amplius; Time</hi> (nor, consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Succession) shall be no more.</hi> Wherefore, since, taking away <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,</hi> 'tis impossible to imagin any thing in <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> but only <hi>Being;</hi> and Eternity is an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely better Duration, or State of <hi>Being,</hi> than this Transitory one, which is Successive; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that <hi>Eternal Rest,</hi> in which we have all we <hi>can have,</hi> or <hi>could acquire</hi> by Motion, <hi>at once,</hi> is

               <p n="1">1. THE three next Chapters of <hi>Simple Modes,</hi> are very suitable to Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Doctrine delivered formerly, and almost all of them agreeable to Nature; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Thoughts</hi> are not to be call'd <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations.</hi>
                  </note> particularly the 20th, which gives us more genuin Definitions of the several Passions; and more aptly, in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, expresses them than Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> has done; tho' he is justly held to have a great Talent in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering his Conceptions. But, I must deny that the <hi>Perception</hi> or <hi>Thought,</hi> made by <hi>Impressions on the Body,</hi> by <hi>Outward Objects,</hi> is to be called <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</hi> For if <hi>Thoughts</hi> be <hi>Sensations,</hi> then the <hi>Sense</hi> can <hi>Think;</hi> which being the proper Act of the <hi>Mind,</hi> I believe none will say if he reflects
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:95549:129"/>
that our Soul is of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Nature. Nor are the Modes of <hi>Thinking</hi> at all proper to the Senses. The Truth is, that Man having two <hi>Natures</hi> in one <hi>Suppositum,</hi> all the Impressions upon him as he is an <hi>Animal,</hi> do also at the same time (I may say the same Instant) affect him also as he is <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual;</hi> whence they are to be called <hi>Sensations,</hi> as they are receiv'd in that <hi>material</hi> Part called <hi>the Seat of Knowledge;</hi> and the same Direct Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, as they proceed <hi>farther,</hi> and affect his Soul, are call'd <hi>Notions,</hi> or <hi>Simple Apprehensions.</hi> Wherefore, as the two <hi>Natures</hi> in Man are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, and have their Distinct Properties and Modes; so the <hi>Words,</hi> that are to express what's peculiar to each of those Natures, are to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd too, and kept to their proper Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; which cannot be, if <hi>Thought,</hi> which is peculiar to the <hi>Mind,</hi> be confounded with <hi>Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which properly belongs to the <hi>Corporeal</hi> part. But I suspect the Printer may be <hi>here</hi> in the Fault, and not the Author; the Sense in this place being something imperfect.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the Question proposed, <hi>(Cap.</hi> 19. § 9.) <hi>Whether it be not probable, that Thinking is the Action, and not the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Thinking</hi> is the <hi>Action,</hi> and not the <hi>Essence</hi> of the Soul.</note> 
                  <hi>Essence of the Soul?</hi> I answer, That 'tis more <hi>than probable;</hi> for 'tis <hi>Demonstrable,</hi> that 'tis only the <hi>Action,</hi> and not the <hi>Essence</hi> of it. For, in such Natures as are <hi>potential,</hi> or apt to <hi>receive</hi> Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions from other things, (as the Soul is in this State;) and therefore their Essence does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in being <hi>Pure Acts</hi> (as Angels are,) <hi>Being</hi> must necessarily be presuppos'd to <hi>Operating;</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when their first Operation (as <hi>Thinking</hi> is
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:95549:129"/>
to the Soul) is a meer <hi>Passion,</hi> caus'd by Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions from another thing; which are therefore purely Accidental to the Subject that receives them. And I wonder Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> would even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this as a Question to be yet decided, or think it but Probable; since he has formerly maintain'd <hi>assertively,</hi> That <hi>Men do not always think:</hi> For if it be not <hi>certain</hi> that Thinking <hi>is not the Essence of the Soul,</hi> it follows necessarily, that <hi>Men must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways think;</hi> since the Soul can never be without her <hi>Essence,</hi> or what's <hi>Essential</hi> to her.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His Position, that <hi>Things are Good or Evil on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reference to Pleasure or Pain,</hi> however it may hap to be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>L.</hi>'s Position, that Things are <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reference to <hi>Pleasure</hi> or <hi>Pain,</hi> is True and Solid.</note> by some well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bigots, is a most solid Truth; and is exceedingly useful to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate Christian Principles, and to shew <hi>God</hi>'s Wisdom and Goodness in governing Mankind Connaturally. He proposes to him <hi>Fulness of Joy, and Pleasures for evermore;</hi> and such as, being Spiritual and most Agreeable to the Nature of the Soul, are <hi>Pure, Durable,</hi> and <hi>filling</hi> the whole Capacity of its boundless Desire; not <hi>Transitory, Mean,</hi> and <hi>Base;</hi> which, tho' they cloy, never satisfie. Heaven would not be Heaven, if it were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>Pleasant</hi> and <hi>Delightful;</hi> nor would Hell be Hell, if it were not <hi>Penal.</hi> And in case that Explication of <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Tenet, which is given it by some of his Followers, be truly <hi>his,</hi> which makes Man's <hi>Summum Bonum</hi> consist in <hi>Pleasure</hi> at large, and chiefly in the <hi>best</hi> Pleasures of the <hi>Mind,</hi> it would not misbecome a Christian Philosopher.

                  <hi>of Christian Morality depends, as on its Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Principle, upon our making a wise Choice of the Pleasures we pursue here.</hi> For, the Object of our Will, and consequently, of its Acts of <hi>Love,</hi> is an <hi>Appearing Good,</hi> and the <hi>Lively</hi> Appearance of that Good is that which makes the Will prompt to act effectually; whence, since that which breeds <hi>Pleasure</hi> in us, must needs <hi>appear Lively</hi> to be a <hi>Good to us,</hi> there needs no more but to chuse wisely what is <hi>most</hi> Pleasant, or <hi>most</hi> Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our True Nature, <hi>Reason;</hi> (such as the best <hi>Spiritual</hi> Goods are;) and we may be sure by such a well-made Choice to arrive at that Best, Greatest, and Purest Pleasure, <hi>Eternal Glory.</hi>

Perhaps a Philosophical Discourse, beginning from the Principles in this affair, if exprest Literally, and pursu'd <note place="margin">Man's <hi>Freedom,</hi> or <hi>Self determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> deduced from Principles.</note> home by Immediate Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, may set this whole business in a Clearer Light; and show us very evidently how Man <hi>determins himself to Action;</hi> and therefore is <hi>Free;</hi> as also <hi>how</hi> he is <hi>Predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd</hi> to determin himself, than any particular Reflexions on our own Interiour: Which, tho' they may oftentimes have some Truth in them, yet, not beginning from the bottom-Truths that concern the point in hand, they can never be <hi>steady,</hi> but are now and then liable to some Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Beginning then with the <hi>Animal</hi> part in Man, and considering him barely as an <hi>Animal,</hi> and wrought upon as <note place="margin">The Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Brutes</hi> in their Determination to Action.</note> 
                  <hi>other</hi> Animals are, I discourse thus. Particles, agreeable to the Nature of the <hi>Animal,</hi> being by the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses convey'd into the Brain, do, if they be but <hi>Few,</hi> lightly affect it; and work no other effect but a kind of small <hi>Liking</hi> of it; If <hi>more,</hi> they make it (as we say) begin to <hi>Fancy</hi> it: But, if they be <hi>very many,</hi> and sent from an Object <hi>very Agreeable</hi> or <hi>Good</hi> to such a Nature; they will in proportion to their Multitude and Strength, cause naturally a <hi>Tendency</hi> towards it, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully excite the Spirits, so as to make the <hi>Animal</hi> pursue it; that is, they will become such a <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Action;</hi> which in <hi>meer Animals</hi> we call <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite.</hi> To which Action that meer <hi>Animal</hi> is not carry'd thro' Choice, or <hi>Freely,</hi> but is <hi>naturally</hi> and necessarily Determin'd to <hi>Act</hi> for the Attainment
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:95549:132"/>
of that Good, in the same manner as Iron fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Load-stone. But, if we consider this Animal, as having now a <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Knowing Compart</hi> join'd to it, things will be order'd after another manner: For, those Impressions are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd farther than the Region of the Brain, even into the <hi>Soul</hi> it self, which is endow'd with a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of <hi>Reflecting</hi> upon those her Notions, whence she gains <hi>exacter</hi> Knowledge of those Bodies that imprinted them. Nor only so, but she can <hi>reflect</hi> upon <hi>her own Operations</hi> too, and <hi>know that she knows</hi> them; by which means she comes acquainted with her <hi>own</hi> Nature, and comes to <hi>see</hi> that <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> is that Nature of hers; which she finds is a <hi>Nobler</hi> part of the Man, than is the <hi>Body;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by it she excels and governs Beasts; and, in great part, under <hi>God,</hi> manages Corporeal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Moreover, she can <hi>discourse</hi> her Thoughts, <hi>compare</hi> the Objects, or the Goods they propose, and <hi>gather</hi> the Preference some ought to have above others.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Things standing thus with the <hi>Man,</hi> it is evident that he has <hi>now</hi> not only that Nature called the <hi>Body,</hi> to <note place="margin">Man naturally pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues what is <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> or <hi>Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
                  </note> provide for; but <hi>another,</hi> and that a <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and much <hi>better</hi> Nature, to look to, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure for it all the <hi>Good</hi> he can, and such Goods as are <hi>Agreeable</hi> to it. He finds evidently, that no Corporeal Things can be its <hi>Proper Good,</hi> taking it as 'tis Distinct from the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> He may easily discern, that its Distinct Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being <hi>Knowing,</hi> or <hi>Rational,</hi> nothing can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it but what is <hi>according to Reason,</hi> or improves <hi>Knowledge;</hi> and that the Acquisition of <hi>Science</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:95549:133"/>
does perfect it in the latter Regard, and <hi>Virtue</hi> in the <hi>Former;</hi> Virtue being nothing but a <hi>Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to act according to Right Reason</hi> in such and such Matters, or in such and such Occasions. <hi>Reason</hi> therefore is the Ground of all true Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and, to act <hi>according to Reason,</hi> is to act <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously:</hi> Wherefore, to act <hi>Virtuously</hi> would be <hi>most Natural</hi> to Man, if his True Nature be not depraved; which it cannot, without Impiety, be thought to be, if we consider it as it came <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> from <hi>God</hi>'s Hand. Wherefore, if it be not so <hi>now,</hi> but be blinded and mis-led from <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> by <hi>Passion</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> (as we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience it is,) it is demonstrable hence, <hi>a posteriori,</hi> that it has been <note place="margin">Therefore his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has been <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi> since his Creation.</note> some way or other <hi>perverted</hi> since its Creation; which Christianity tells us, has happen'd thro' <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin,</hi> transfus'd from <hi>Adam.</hi> Moreover, as the Sense of Corporeal or Sensible Pleasure or Pain invites the Man to pursue what is for the Good of the <hi>Body,</hi> and makes him tend towards what's Agreeable, and eschew what's Harmful to <hi>it;</hi> so, in Man, as he is <hi>Rational,</hi> there is, or ought to be, answerable to those, a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Pleasure and Pain, <hi>viz.</hi> the Satisfaction and Dis-satisfaction of <hi>Mind,</hi> which we call <hi>Conscience,</hi> or the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> annex'd to all our Actions; <hi>our Thoughts</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> says) <hi>accusing or excusing one another;</hi> so to keep us from <hi>Unreasonableness,</hi> or <hi>Vice,</hi> and make us more pliable to follow <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Virtue.</hi> For, as Grief or Pain is caus'd in us by our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that our Bodies, for which we have a great Concern, is Disorder'd; so the <hi>Stings of Conscience</hi> (as far as they proceed from Nature) come from
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:95549:133"/>
our Knowing that our <hi>better</hi> part, our <hi>Soul,</hi> for which we ought to have an incomparably higher Concern, is wounded or disorder'd in her <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality,</hi> which is her Essence.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Hence is seen, that Man is apt to be wrought upon by two several sorts of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, <hi>viz.</hi> those which are sutable <note place="margin">Therefore <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> Motives are added, to strengthen Man's weaken'd Nature, or <hi>Reason.</hi>
                  </note> to the Good of the <hi>Body,</hi> and those which are agreeable to the Good of the <hi>Soul.</hi> Now, were not Humane Nature (as was said) <hi>perverted,</hi> these two could not <hi>clash;</hi> nor would there be any Inclination in the Man to do any thing which could prejudice his Superior Part, <hi>Reason;</hi> to which the Inferior, the Body, is <hi>naturally Subservient.</hi> But, Man's Nature being poison'd in the Spring-head, the Motives of the First Kind did hazard quite to over-bear the Motives of the Second Sort; and so Mankind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came liable to act, in a manner, perpetually <hi>against Reason,</hi> or, (to express it in Christian Language,) all his Actions might have been Sinful, and himself <hi>a Slave to Sin.</hi> Wherefore, to obviate the violent Impulses of Passion, and to strengthen our Reason against its Assaults, <hi>God</hi>'s Wisdom, Goodness and Mercy took care to give us a Doctrine full of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural</hi> Motives, and those the most powerful ones that could be conceiv'd; taught us by a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Master,</hi> and ascertain'd after the <hi>best Manner;</hi> so to make the <hi>Appearance</hi> of the <hi>Eternal Goods</hi> it proposed (if reflected on) <hi>Lively;</hi> which might keep us upright, and move us effectually to follow our true Nature, <hi>Reason;</hi> and so pursue our true Last End, by the Practice of <hi>Virtue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:95549:134"/>
8. Now, there can be no Question but that, both in the State of <hi>Pure</hi> and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted Nature, as also in the <note place="margin">Supernatural Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives being the stronger, would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prevail, were they duly <hi>Apply'd</hi> to a Subject dispos'd.</note> 
                  <hi>Corrupted</hi> State of it, thus pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully assisted, the Innate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension of the Will tending strongly to <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Happiness;</hi> and <hi>[Good]</hi> and <hi>[Motive]</hi> being in our Case the <hi>same,</hi> Eternal Goods would most strongly carry the Will, and prevail over Temporal ones; as certainly as Heat <hi>ut octo</hi> would prevail over Heat <hi>ut duo,</hi> were there the <hi>same Application</hi> of one as of the other to the same Object equally well Dispos'd; in case the Proposal or <hi>Appearance</hi> of both these Goods were but <hi>Equal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Both these Motives, <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> have their several <hi>Species</hi> or Phantasms beating upon the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Why</hi> the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and <hi>Will</hi> must be the <hi>same Power</hi> substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially.</note> Seat of Knowledge; with this difference, that the <hi>Natural</hi> Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasms, being directly imprinted, are <hi>Proper</hi> ones; but those Reflex ones, being of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Natures (as the Words and Language they are express'd in do testifie) are <hi>Metaphorical</hi> and <hi>Improper.</hi> As then, when in a <hi>meer Animal</hi> a Sensation is made by a small Number of Agreeable <hi>Effluviums</hi> they make only a slight Fancy, Imagination or Representation of it; but when an Impression is made by a great <hi>Multitude</hi> of them, the Animal is Naturally <hi>ripe for Action,</hi> and is <hi>Enabled,</hi> or has a <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>act,</hi> which Power, thus prompt to act, we call <hi>Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite:</hi> So (as was said above) in a <hi>Rational</hi> or <hi>Knowing Animal,</hi> a small Quantity of Reflex No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:95549:134"/>
may serve to give it a <hi>speculative</hi> Knowledge of the Object proposed: But, when those <hi>Reflex</hi> Impressions are <hi>many,</hi> and of such Objects as, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>very Agreeable</hi> or Good to our true Nature, are therefore <hi>highly concerning</hi> us to have them; the <hi>Appearance</hi> of them is so <hi>Lively,</hi> and the <hi>Strength</hi> of their Motive Force is so <hi>great,</hi> that the Man becomes fit to <hi>act for them;</hi> which <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of Action we call <hi>Will.</hi> So that <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> differ but in <hi>Degree,</hi> as did <hi>Fancy</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite</hi> in a meer <hi>Animal.</hi> By which Explication are avoided all the Incoherent Positions about this Subject; such as are, that the Understanding <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects</hi> the Will; that the Will <hi>knows;</hi> that one Power works upon another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whence is seen,</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>First,</hi> That the way to conquer in our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Warfare, is, to strive to <hi>Multiply</hi> and <hi>Strengthen</hi> those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex <note place="margin">How to <hi>conquer</hi> in our Spiritual Warfare.</note> Thoughts, especially those given us by <hi>Supernatural</hi> Motives; and to make their Appearance <hi>Lively</hi> in the Soul; that so it may be able to beat down and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the opposite Band of Impressions from <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal</hi> Objects which assault it: Which I conceive to be what is Literally meant by a <hi>Lively Faith</hi> working in us that best Virtue, <hi>Charity.</hi> Next, in order to the <hi>same</hi> End, we must endeavour, by a cautious and prudent Avoidance, to <hi>lessen</hi> and <hi>weaken</hi> the Impressions from <hi>Corporeal</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; which is done by that Virtue which we call <hi>Temperance,</hi> or (when 'tis to some high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree) <hi>Mortification;</hi> and, by that means to <hi>dim</hi> the <hi>Appearance</hi> those Objects would otherwise make; lest, if it be <hi>too Lively,</hi> they should over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:95549:135"/>
the Motive Force of those Objects which are <hi>Spiritual.</hi> But, it is to be noted, that the <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying,</hi> or <hi>frequently repeating</hi> those Reflex Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, are not so necessary to <hi>every</hi> Person, nor always the best. For, a Wise, Judicious Christian, who, out of a <hi>Clear Sight</hi> of Spiritual Motives, has (by a thorow-Penetration of their Excellency and Preferribleness) his Speculative Thoughts so Lively, that they <hi>fix</hi> his Interior Practical Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>work steadily</hi> for the Attainment of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happiness, is a far more <hi>Manly</hi> and <hi>Strong</hi> Christian, than those who arrive at a high Pitch by the frequent Dints of Praying, or other good Exercises, almost hourly continued: For, those <hi>Well-knit Thoughts,</hi> and <hi>Rational Judgments,</hi> are (as it were) an Impenetrable <hi>Phalanx;</hi> and being Connatural to our Reason, no Assault can shock or break their Ranks. Yet, even in those firmest Souls, <hi>Christian Discipline</hi> and <hi>Vigilance</hi> must be observ'd; lest, not having those strong Thoughts or Judgments <hi>still in readiness,</hi> they be <hi>surprized</hi> by their Ghostly Enemy; which I take to have been King <hi>David</hi>'s Case, when he first sinn'd.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is seen hence, that Man <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines himself to Action,</hi> or is <hi>Free.</hi> For, 'tis evident, both to Reason <note place="margin">'Tis evident, that Man <hi>determines himself</hi> to Action,</note> and Experience, that all those Thoughts, Discourses, Judgments and Affections, he had in him <hi>before,</hi> naturally, or supernaturally, are the <hi>Causes</hi> of the <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> of his <hi>Will.</hi> Wherefore, all these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Modes</hi> or <hi>Accidents</hi> belonging to him, and Modes not being <hi>Distinct Entities</hi> from the <hi>Thing</hi> to which they belong, but <hi>the Thing it self,</hi> (or, the <hi>Man</hi> thus modify'd;) it follows, that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:95549:135"/>
                  <hi>Man <hi>determines himself to Action;</hi>
                  </hi> or, is a <hi>Free Agent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Since Man has neither his Being, his Powers, his Actions, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, the Circumstances by <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Yet, as</hi> Predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd <hi>by</hi> GOD.</note> which he came to be imbu'd with his good Thoughts (from whence he has the Proposals of his true Good, and of those incomparable Motives to pursue it) <hi>from Himself;</hi> but had all these from the <hi>Maker</hi> and <hi>Orderer</hi> of the World: And, since <hi>this Series</hi> of Internal and External Causes (called, in Christian Language, <hi>God's Grace)</hi> did produce this <hi>Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of himself,</hi> 'tis manifest, that he was <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determin'd</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>First Cause,</hi> thus to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine himself, as far as there was <hi>Entity</hi> or <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in his Action.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Since all our <hi>Powers</hi> are, by the Intent of Nature, ordain'd to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> us, and that Power, called <note place="margin">Determination to Virtuous Action does <hi>perfect,</hi> and not destroy <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Freedom,</hi> does not <hi>perfect</hi> any Man while he determines himself to that which will bring him to <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Misery;</hi> it follows, that the <hi>more</hi> he is Determin'd to <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>true Goodness,</hi> the <hi>more Free</hi> he is. Again, Since a Man is <hi>Free</hi> when he acts <hi>according to the true Inclination of his Nature;</hi> and the true natural Inclination of a <hi>Man</hi> is to act according to <hi>Right Reason,</hi> that is, <hi>Virtuously;</hi> it follows, that <hi>Freedom</hi> is then <hi>most truly</hi> such, and the Man <hi>most truly Free,</hi> when he is <hi>Determin'd</hi> to Virtuous Actions. Whence <hi>Irrationality,</hi> or <hi>Sin,</hi> is by the Holy Ghost called <hi>Slavery,</hi> which is opposite to <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> From which <hi>Slavery,</hi> the Mercy of <hi>God,</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:95549:136"/>
meerly and solely through the Merits of his Son, our Redeemer, has <hi>freed us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> We Experience, that the Lively Proposal of Temporal and Eternal Goods, when it arrives to that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Good,</hi> if evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Appearing</hi> such, does certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determine the Will.</note> pitch, that there is <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> such a <hi>Plenitude (ex parte Subjecti)</hi> of such Objects or Motives, that it hinders the Co-appearance, Co-existence, and much more the Competition of the <hi>Contrary</hi> Motives, does <hi>always</hi> carry the <hi>Will,</hi> or the <hi>Man,</hi> along with it. For, the Object of the Will being an <hi>Appearing Good,</hi> and no <hi>other Good,</hi> in that Juncture, (at least, Considerably,) <hi>appearing,</hi> because the Mind is <hi>full</hi> of the <hi>other;</hi> it follows, that the Inclination of the Will to <hi>Good in Common,</hi> which Man is naturally determin'd to, must needs carry the Soul; no other (as was said) <hi>then Appearing.</hi> Whence, Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Position, that <hi>Uneasiness alone is present;</hi> and his Deduction thence, that therefore nothing but <hi>Uneasiness</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the Will to act, is shewn to be Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less: For, an <hi>Appearing Good</hi> cannot but be always <hi>Present</hi> to the Soul; otherwise, it could not <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</hi> or be an <hi>Appearing Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Hence wrong Judgments arise, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thro' Want of <hi>Information,</hi> as, when Men are not imbu'd <note place="margin">
                     <hi>How</hi> Wrong Judgments <hi>come.</hi>
                  </note> with sufficient <hi>Knowledge</hi> of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Goods; or else, thro' Want of <hi>Consideration;</hi> whence, by not perfectly <hi>weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>comparing</hi> both, they come to <hi>prefer</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Goods before Eternal ones.</p>
               <p n="16">
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:95549:136"/>
16. <hi>Lastly,</hi> 'tis to be noted, that Sin does not always spring from <hi>False Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Judgments, but from their <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sin</hi> generally springs from <hi>True</hi> but <hi>Disproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate</hi> Judgments.</note> being <hi>Disproportionate.</hi> For, 'tis a Truth that Temporal Goods are <hi>in some sort</hi> Agreeable to us; nor would they hurt us for loving them as far as they <hi>merit</hi> to be lov'd, provided we did but love Eternal Goods as much as <hi>they</hi> deserve to be loved <hi>too.</hi> Sin therefore is hence occasion'd, that thro' too close and frequent a Converse with <hi>them,</hi> we too much <hi>conceit,</hi> and make <hi>vast</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of these <hi>Temporal</hi> Goods in <hi>proportion</hi> of what we make of <hi>Eternal</hi> ones. And, were not this so, no Sin would remain in a bad Soul when separate, or in a Devil; nor, consequently, the proper Punishment of Sin, Damnation, because they know all Truths <hi>Speculatively.</hi> Wherefore, their <hi>Inordinate</hi> Practical Judgments (in which Sin consists) springs hence, that they do not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,</hi> or (as we say) <hi>lay to heart</hi> the Goodness of True Felicity, because they <hi>over-conceit</hi> or make <hi>too-great</hi> Judgments of the Goodness found in some <hi>False Last End,</hi> which they had chosen. Yet these Disproportionate Judgments, tho' <hi>Speculatively True,</hi> are apt to beget <hi>wrong Practical Judgments,</hi> and <hi>wrong</hi> Discourses or <hi>Paralogisms</hi> in the Soul of a Sinner, to the prejudice of his Reason; as has been shown in my METHOD, <hi>Book</hi> 3, <hi>Less.</hi> 10. §. 18.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Discourse about <hi>Uneasiness,</hi> lies so cross to some part of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that it obliges me to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min <note place="margin">Of <hi>Uneasiness,</hi> and Mr. <hi>L's</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course concerning it.</note> it.

Now, if this be so, it will follow, that 'tis <hi>Good</hi> only which is the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Motive of the <hi>Will;</hi> and <hi>Ease,</hi> no otherwise than as it is <hi>Good.</hi>

20. <hi>Thirdly, Appearing Good</hi> being held by all, to be the Object of the Will, (for none hold, that <hi>Good</hi> will <note place="margin">The <hi>Appearance</hi> of the Good is of greatest weight, but, in a manner, disregarded by Mr. <hi>Locke.</hi>

Whereas, even the <hi>Greatest</hi> Good, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Hence, his Argument, that <hi>[Everlasting Unspeakable Goods do not hold the Will;</hi> whereas, <hi>very great Uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness does,]</hi> has not the least Force; because he still leaves out the <hi>Degree</hi> of their <hi>Appearing</hi> such to us. For, since (especially in our Case) <hi>eadem est ratio non entium, &amp; non apparentium;</hi> and no Cause works its Effect, but as it is <hi>Apply'd;</hi> he should either have put an <hi>Equal Appearance</hi> of the two Contesting Motives, or nothing will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p n="21">21. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This <hi>Equal Appearance</hi> put, his Argument is not Conclusive, but opposes himself.

doubtlesly, the Greatest <hi>present</hi> Uneasiness Flesh and Blood could undergo; yet the <hi>Lively Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi> of their Eternal Happiness, (tho' <hi>Distant,</hi> and <hi>Absent,)</hi> which their Well-grounded Faith, and Erected Hope assur'd them of, after those Short, tho' most Penal Sufferings; <hi>overcame</hi> all that Inconceivable <hi>Uneasiness</hi> they suffer'd at <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22. <hi>Lastly,</hi> How can it be thought, that the getting rid of <hi>Uneasiness,</hi> or (which is the same) the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining <note place="margin">Prov'd, because <hi>Ease</hi> is not the Perfection of a Soul.</note> of <hi>Ease,</hi> can be the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and Proper Object of the Will. Powers are ordain'd to <hi>perfect</hi> the Subject to which they belong; and, the <hi>better</hi> the Object is which they are employ'd about, <hi>so much,</hi> in proportion, the Man is the <hi>Perfecter,</hi> who applies that Power to attain it. It cannot then be doubted, but <hi>True Happiness</hi> being the Ultimate Perfection Man can aim or arrive at, which is only attainable by Acts of his <hi>Will;</hi> that Power was naturally ordain'd to bring Man to his highest State of Perfection by <hi>such</hi> an Acquisition; or, by loving above all Things, and pursuing that Object; and, consequently, since this consists in obtaining his <hi>Summum Bonum,</hi> 'tis the <hi>Goodness</hi> of the Object, apprehended and <hi>conceited</hi> such, which determines the Will; and, therefore, the Straining after <hi>Greater,</hi> and even the <hi>Greatest</hi> Goods, and being <hi>Determin'd</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> is what, by the Design of Nature, his Will was given him for. Now, who can think, that meerly to <hi>be at Ease,</hi> is this <hi>Greatest Good;</hi> or the Motive, Object, End, or Determiner of the Will? <hi>Ease,</hi> without any <hi>farther</hi> Prospect,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:95549:138"/>
seems rather to be the Object of an Idle Drone, who cares not for <hi>perfecting</hi> himself at all; but sits still, satisfy'd with his Dull and Stupid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolency. It seems to destroy the Acquisition of all <hi>Virtue;</hi> which is <hi>Arduous,</hi> and not perform'd but by <hi>Contrasting</hi> with <hi>Ease,</hi> and <hi>present</hi> Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions. It quite takes away the very Notion of the Heroick Virtue of <hi>Fortitude;</hi> whose ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Object is the Overcoming <hi>Ease,</hi> and attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such Things as are <hi>Difficult,</hi> and Inconsistent with it. I expect, Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> will say, that all these Candidates of Virtue had not acted, had they not, according to their present Thoughts, found it <hi>Uneasie</hi> not to act as they did. But I reply, that Uneasiness was not their <hi>Sole Motive</hi> of Acting, nor the <hi>only,</hi> or Formal Determiner of their Will: For, in that case, if meerly to be <hi>rid of Uneasiness</hi> had mov'd them to act, meer <hi>Ease</hi> had satisfy'd them. Whereas, 'tis Evident, they aim'd at a <hi>Greater Good</hi> than meerly to <hi>be at Ease.</hi> In a Word; <hi>Ease</hi> bears in its Notion, a Sluggish, Unactive, and most Imperfect Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position: It seems to sute only with the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or Insensibility of a Stoick. <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> have some Briskness in their Signification: <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> is <hi>Active,</hi> and implies a <hi>Tendency</hi> to some Good we affect: But the meer <hi>being at Ease</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes no more but a <hi>Stupid Indisturbance;</hi> which Noble Souls hate, as <hi>mean,</hi> and are weary of it: And, if <hi>Ease</hi> be the proper Motive and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner of the <hi>Will;</hi> and the Greatest Good the Will can have, or wish, is <hi>Eternal Glory;</hi> it would follow, that the Glory of the Saints and Angels in Heaven is nothing but being in the <hi>best</hi> manner <hi>at Ease;</hi> which is far from Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

the Soul to the <hi>highest</hi> Degree of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as <hi>Glory,</hi> or the <hi>Beatifying Sight of <hi>God</hi>
                  </hi> does; and only signifies, she is, when in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, securely <hi>out of Harm's way,</hi> or free from being <hi>disturb'd</hi> ever after: By which, no great <hi>Good</hi> accrues to her, but only a kind of Neutral State, in which she shall receive <hi>no Hurt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. The true Point then seems to me to stand thus; The Object of the Will, an <hi>Appearing Good,</hi> works many <note place="margin">The Truth of this Point stated.</note> Effects immediately consequent to one another. First, When the Appearance is but <hi>slight,</hi> it begets a <hi>Liking</hi> of it; when <hi>Lively,</hi> a <hi>Love</hi> of it, which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the Will to it; to which, if <hi>Great,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows an <hi>Effectual Tendency</hi> towards it, called <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> of it. <hi>Desire</hi> not satisfy'd, <hi>troubles</hi> us, or makes us <hi>Uneasie:</hi> Uneasiness makes us strive to change our Condition, to <hi>get Ease.</hi> This makes us to cast about, and Consider how to <hi>find Means</hi> to do it: Means found, we make <hi>use</hi> of them, and <hi>actually go about</hi> to rid our selves of what was <hi>Uneasie</hi> to us. Now, tho' some of these are <hi>nearer</hi> to our Outward Action than others, yet the <hi>Appearing Good</hi> in the Object is the <hi>Common Cause</hi> which produces all those Orderly Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions; in virtue of which, as the <hi>First Motive,</hi> they do <hi>all</hi> Act, Assist and Concurr to determine our Will to go about the Outward Action with Vigour.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Ere I part with this Chapter of <hi>Power,</hi> I am to observe, that Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> has not any where so much as <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>L.</hi> omits here the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> to be <hi>a Thing,</hi> tho' Nature suggests i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:95549:139"/>
Clear a Notion of it, as of any other <hi>Power</hi> whatever. For, as oft as we see <hi>one</hi> Thing made of <hi>Another,</hi> which we know is not <hi>Created a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new,</hi> so often our Natural Reason forces us to acknowledge that <hi>somewhat</hi> of the former Thing <hi>could be made another Thing;</hi> and this, as evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as when we see a Thing <hi>Act,</hi> which did <hi>not Act</hi> before, we must acknowledge it had ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently a <hi>Power to Act;</hi> and thence we frame an <hi>Idea</hi> or Notion of <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Power</hi> accordingly. But of this <hi>Power,</hi> called <hi>Matter,</hi> and of its Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical Compart, the <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Act,</hi> I have treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed largely already in my Appendix to my <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi> to which I refer my Reader; as also here, <hi>Preliminary</hi> 5. §. 6, 7. I note, by this Omission of the Notion of Metaphysical <hi>Power,</hi> or <hi>Matter,</hi> that Mr. <hi>L.</hi> holds so rigorously to his First Ground, that all our Notions are got by <hi>Sensation</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion,</hi> that he seems to make account, that, by working upon <hi>these,</hi> we do not gain <hi>other</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by using our <hi>Reason;</hi> in which Sense, I must deny that Ground of his. Or else, he omits <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>other</hi> Notions, (especially <hi>Metaphysical</hi> ones,) because he finds no <hi>Proper</hi> or <hi>Formal</hi> Similitudes for them in his <hi>Fancy;</hi> which makes it still more Evident that he too much consults his <hi>Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Faculty, to the Prejudice of his <hi>Reason;</hi> and, too frequently, means by his <hi>Ideas,</hi> meer <hi>Fancies.</hi> Which also is the reason why he blunders so about the Notion of <hi>Substance.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. I Find nothing in <hi>Chap.</hi> 22th, <hi>[Of Mixed Modes]</hi> to reflect on, but what has been spoke to already. The Author pursues with much Accuracy his <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Our</hi> Mixture of our Notions is <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,</hi> Mr. <hi>L.</hi>'s <hi>Irregular</hi> and <hi>Disorderly.</hi>
                  </note> own Method of shewing how his <hi>Ideas</hi> of Mixt <hi>Modes</hi> are made up of <hi>Simple</hi> ones. Which, in a manner, falls into the same, as does our way of <hi>ranging</hi> all our Notions into the <hi>Common Head</hi> of Substance and its. <hi>Modes,</hi> and then compounding them as Use and Occasion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites us, or rather as Nature forces us. Nor do I see how the Name <hi>ties</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> fancies) the several <hi>Ideas</hi> together, more than barely by <hi>signifying</hi> the Combination of them made before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand <hi>in our Minds.</hi> The different Method in this Point, taken by Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> and us, seems to be this. That <hi>We,</hi> by distributing our Ideas or <hi>Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> into <hi>Ten Common Heads,</hi> do know at first view in which Box to look for them; and, this disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, we find also all our Particular Notions, that are within the Precincts of each Head, by Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Head it self by <hi>Intrinsecal Differences,</hi> or <hi>more</hi> and <hi>less</hi> of it; which done, the Mixture of that Compounded Notion is <hi>Close</hi> and <hi>Compacted;</hi>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:95549:140"/>
each Part of it, if in the same Branch of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, being <hi>Essential</hi> to the other. And, if some Part of the Compound Notion be taken from <hi>other</hi> Heads, we, by looking into their Notions, and Comparing them by our Reason, know <hi>how much,</hi> and what Share of that Notion is borrow'd from others, and <hi>belongs</hi> or <hi>not</hi> belongs to it; and in what <hi>manner</hi> it belongs to it: Which teaches us how to <hi>predicate</hi> diversly; and instructs us <hi>how</hi> the Terms of our Propositions are <hi>connected,</hi> and whether they be connected <hi>at all.</hi> Which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly conduces to <hi>Science,</hi> and (as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) is hardly performable by <hi>his</hi> way, but rather is Inconsistent with it. Again, while we <hi>Divide</hi> those Common Heads, in case our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion be rightly made, we, with the same labour, frame Genuin and Proper <hi>Definitions</hi> of each No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under each respective Head. Whereas, we conceive, his way of Mixing his <hi>Ideas</hi> wants the Beauty of placing their Parts <hi>orderly,</hi> which the Process from Superiour to Inferiour Notions <hi>has;</hi> and his Mixt <hi>Ideas,</hi> if he goes about to explain and compound them, have so Ragged, Shatter'd, and Dishevell'd an Appearance, that 'tis hard to determin which of his <hi>Simple Ideas</hi> that makes this Mixture, (much more which of his Compounded ones) is to be the First, Second, Third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that the Definitions of his <hi>Ideas</hi> do more resemble a <hi>Confused Heap</hi> than a <hi>Regular Building;</hi> as will be observ'd by any Man who reflects on those Definitions and Explications of his <hi>Ideas</hi> he now and then gives us. In which, however it may be pretended, that his Materials are oft-times <hi>proper,</hi> and the same with ours, yet it will be impossible to shew, that his <hi>way</hi> of laying those Materials to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:95549:141"/>
is <hi>Regular,</hi> Artificial, or Handsome. He speaks of the Combinations, Compositions, and Mixtures of his <hi>Ideas;</hi> but I do not remember he ever tells us, much less maintains, their <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity,</hi> or the <hi>Order</hi> in which his several <hi>Ideas,</hi> or the <hi>Words</hi> which express them, are to be <hi>placed;</hi> which must necessarily leave his Reader's Thoughts in much Confusion. Indeed, it seems not to have been his Intention in this Treatise to observe the <hi>Rules of Art,</hi> but only to give us our <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials;</hi> wherefore, as I do not <hi>object,</hi> or much <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute</hi> this Deficiency, so I thought it not amiss to <hi>note</hi> it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. While I perused Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s 23th Chapter, of the <hi>Idea of Substance,</hi> I was heartily grieved to see the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <note place="margin">Without knowing what <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Thing</hi> is, we cannos pretend to <hi>Philosophy.</hi>
                  </note> Wits, for want of True Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, and thro' their not light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the right way of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophizing, lay Grounds for Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism, to the utter Subversion of all <hi>Science;</hi> and this, not <hi>designedly,</hi> but with a <hi>good Intention,</hi> and out of their Sincerity and Care not to <hi>affirm</hi> more than they <hi>know.</hi> He fancies that the Knowledge of <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Extension</hi> are absolutely Unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable. Now, if we be altogether Ignorant what <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Thing</hi> means, we must bid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu to all Philosophy, which is the <hi>Knowledge of Things,</hi> and confess that we talk all the while of <hi>we know not what:</hi> And, if we be invincibly Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what <hi>Extension</hi> is, farewell to all the Mathematical Sciences; which, (those that treat of <hi>Number,</hi> or Arithmetick, excepted) do all of them presuppose our Knowledge of <hi>Extension,</hi> and are wholly <hi>grounded</hi> on that Knowledge.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:95549:141"/>
Wherefore, that I may perform the Duty I owe to <hi>Science</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> I judge my self obliged first to establish the Literal Truth in this Point; and, next, to satisfie his Scruples and Difficulties. In order to which I discourse thus.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We can have no Knowledge of a <hi>Nothing,</hi> formally as such; therefore all our Knowledge must be of <hi>Things</hi> one <note place="margin">All our Notions, and, amongst them, that of <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Res</hi> is taken from the <hi>Thing.</hi>
                  </note> way or other; that is, all our Knowledge must either be of the <hi>Res</hi> or the <hi>Modus rei;</hi> or, (as the Schools express it) of <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Accidents;</hi> for, <hi>other</hi> Notions we cannot have. Again, Since Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> grants the Accidents or Modes are not <hi>distinct Entities</hi> from the <hi>Thing;</hi> they can only differ from it <hi>Notionally;</hi> or, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Notions, Considerations, Respects, or Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted Conceptions, which our limited Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing (not able to comprehend at once the <hi>whole</hi> Thing, and all that belongs to it, in the Bulk) has of the <hi>Thing,</hi> which grounds them all. Hence all our Knowledge of <hi>Quantity,</hi> (under what Name, or in whatever Formality we take it) is of the <hi>Thing as</hi> 'tis Big, Divisible, or Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Our Knowledge of Quality, is of the <hi>Thing</hi> consider'd <hi>according</hi> to what renders its <hi>particular</hi> Nature Perfect or Imperfect. <hi>Relation</hi> is still the <hi>Thing, according</hi> to that in it which grounds our comparing it to others. Now, as we can consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Thing <hi>according</hi> to its <hi>Modes</hi> or <hi>Accidents,</hi> so we can have <hi>another</hi> Notion or Consideration of the <hi>Thing</hi> as to <hi>its own self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> abstracting from all these former Considerations; or a Notion of the <hi>Thing,</hi> (not according to any Mode it has, but) precisely according to its <hi>Thingship</hi> (as we
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:95549:142"/>
may say) or Reality; that is, in order to <hi>Being;</hi> or (which is the same) we can consider it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely and formally as an <hi>Ens, Res, Substance</hi> or <hi>Thing;</hi> and all we can say of it, <hi>thus consider'd,</hi> is, that <hi>'tis capable to be actually.</hi> For, since we see Created Things have <hi>Actual Being,</hi> yet so that they can <hi>cease to be;</hi> all that we can say of them, (thus consider'd) is, that they are <hi>Capable to be.</hi> Besides, since we see they <hi>have</hi> Being, were this <hi>Actual Being</hi> or Existence <hi>Essential</hi> to them, they would <hi>be of themselves,</hi> and so <hi>could not but be;</hi> and, consequently, must <hi>always be;</hi> which our common Reason and Experience contradicts; in regard we know them to have been <hi>made;</hi> and we see many of them daily <hi>Produced,</hi> and others <hi>Corrupted.</hi> This Discourse is built on this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that all our <hi>Ideas</hi> or Notions (and amongst them the Notion of <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Thing)</hi> are but so many <hi>Conceptions</hi> of the <hi>Thing;</hi> or which (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Word <hi>[Conception] objectively)</hi> is the same, the <hi>Thing thus</hi> or thus <hi>conceiv'd;</hi> which, besides what's said here, is prov'd at large in my Second and Third Preliminaries.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now, according to this Explication, which when we are distinguishing the Notion of <hi>Thing</hi> or Substance <note place="margin">We cannot be Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Notion of <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Thing.</hi>
                  </note> from its <hi>Modes</hi> (as both of us are here) is evidently true; it is so far from being Impossible to <hi>know,</hi> even <hi>distinctly,</hi> what the Word <hi>[Substance]</hi> or, which is the same <hi>[Thing]</hi> means, or what Substance is, that it is impossible to be <hi>ignorant</hi> of it.

Which vast Errour both perverts all true Philosophy, and is against a First Principle in Metaphysicks, by making <hi>Unum</hi> to be <hi>Divisum in se,</hi> or <hi>One Entity</hi> to be <hi>Many.</hi> Now, if these Modes be <hi>Things,</hi> or (to speak more properly) if the Notion of every <hi>manner</hi> of a Thing be the formal Notion of the <hi>Thing</hi> it self, or of <hi>what's Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Existing;</hi> first, the Nature of <hi>Modes</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd; for they will be no longer the <hi>[How,]</hi> but the <hi>[What;]</hi> and the Nature or Notion of <hi>Substance,</hi> or <hi>Ens,</hi> is lost too; for, if all the Modes

But, first, this Objection has no Ground; because all Definitions and Explications in the World are the <hi>same Sense</hi> with the Notion they Define and Explicate; and, were it not so, they would be no Definitions nor Explications of <hi>that</hi> Notion; for they do no more but give us <hi>all the Parts</hi> of the Entire Notion, and <hi>all the Parts</hi> are the same as the <hi>Whole.</hi> Next, how does it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that, because we cannot <hi>explicate</hi> it, we do not <hi>know</hi> it? Whereas, the <hi>direct contrary</hi> follows
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:95549:145"/>
in our present Case: For, the <hi>commonest</hi> Notions can the <hi>worst</hi> be <hi>defin'd.</hi> because they <hi>least need</hi> it, being <hi>Self-known,</hi> or Self-evident. Not all the Wit of Man can Define and Explicate what it is to <hi>be;</hi> and, yet, all Mankind knows it <hi>perfectly,</hi> or else it is impossible they, not knowing what the <hi>Copula</hi> means, should know the Truth or Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of any Proposition whatever. Thirdly, He seems to think that (as some of the School-men do imagin) Contradictory Positions may follow out of the Notion of <hi>Extension;</hi> else, why should he imagin the Difficulties concerning it are <hi>Inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable:</hi> Which I must declare against, as the the <hi>worst</hi> piece of <hi>Scepticism,</hi> next to the denying all First Principles. For, if Contradictory Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may follow out of any Notion taken from the <hi>Thing,</hi> then that Notion, and consequently the Thing it self, would not have any <hi>Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Verity</hi> in <hi>it,</hi> but be purely <hi>Chimerical.</hi> Add, that the learned <hi>Thomas Albius,</hi> in his Excellent Preface before the Latin Edition of Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi>'s <hi>Treatise</hi> of <hi>Bodies,</hi> has clearly solv'd those Imaginary Contradictions.</p>
               <p n="9">9.

The same, in other Terms, is the Ground of Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Perplexity how Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Parts do <hi>cohere;</hi> to which, the properest and most Satisfactory Answer is, because there is <hi>Quantity</hi> in them, which is Essentially <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued;</hi> and, so does Formally give <hi>Coherence</hi> of Parts to <hi>Body,</hi> its Subject. By the same means we have a Clear Reason afforded us, why Bodies <hi>impell</hi> one another; which Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> thinks is Inexplicable. For, putting one Body to be thrust against another, the Body that is <hi>Passive</hi> must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be shov'd forwards, or there must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be Penetration of Parts; unless, perhaps, at first, the Impulsive Force be so slight and leisurely, that it is able to cause only some Degree of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densation.

                  </note> then argues, that we ought no more to deny the Existence of <hi>Those,</hi> than of <hi>These.</hi> Which I should like well, did he maintain and prove first, that the Nature of Bodily Substances is <hi>clearly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible:</hi> But, to make those Notions which are
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:95549:147"/>
most Essential and Proper to Bodies, and most Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious of all others, <hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>Entity</hi> or <hi>Substance,</hi> and their <hi>Extension,</hi> to be <hi>Unintelligible,</hi> and then to tell us, that <hi>The Idea of Spiritual Natures are as Clear as that of Bodily Substance,</hi> which he takes such pains to shew is <hi>not Clear at all,</hi> is, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, no great Argument for their <hi>Clearness,</hi> nor their <hi>Existence</hi> neither; but rather, a strong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against both: The Parallel amounting to this, that we know not what to make either of the one, or of the other.</p>
               <p n="12">12. As for the Knowledge we have of <hi>Spiritual</hi> Natures, my Principles oblige me to discourse it thus: We can have <note place="margin">The Reason <hi>Why;</hi> and the Manner <hi>How.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. THE 24th Chapter <hi>[Of the Collective Ideas of Substance]</hi> gives me no Occasion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect. Only when he lays (as it were) for his Ground, that <hi>the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Mind <hi>alone</hi> does not <hi>collect</hi> Notions, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them.</note> 
                  <hi>Mind</hi> has <hi>a Power to compare, or collect many Ideas into one,</hi> I am to suppose he means, that the Mind does not this of her self <hi>alone,</hi> without the Joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting of the Body, as has been often prov'd above; for, otherwise, the <hi>whole,</hi> or the <hi>Man,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said to be the Author of that Action.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The 25th Chapter gives us the true Notion of <hi>Relation,</hi> and very clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd; which he seconds with <note place="margin">Verbal Relations come not from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in our <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> but for want of a <hi>Real Ground.</hi>
                  </note> divers other Solid Truths, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>some Terms which seem Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute are Relatives;</hi> that <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be only betwixt two Things;</hi> and that <hi>All things are capable of Relation.</hi> What I reflect on is, that he gives us not the true Difference between <hi>Real</hi> and meerly <hi>Verbal</hi> Relations; nor the true Reason why some Relative Terms <hi>have,</hi> and others <hi>have not Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi> He thinks the Reasons why we call some of them ExtrinsecalDenominations (which is the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:95549:148"/>
same with <hi>Verbal Relations)</hi> proceed from <hi>Defect in our Language,</hi> or because we want a Word to signifie them: Whereas, this matters not a Jot; since we can have the <hi>Idea</hi> or <hi>Notion</hi> of Relation in our Minds, if we have <hi>good Ground</hi> for it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have a Word to signifie it or no; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if we have a <hi>Real Ground</hi> for it, we shall quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invent either some one Word, or else some Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocution to express it. Let us see then what our Principles in this Affair say to us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Relation</hi> is not here taken for our <hi>Act</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, (for then it would belong to another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Head of Notions, call'd <hi>Action)</hi> but for the <hi>Thing</hi> as it is referred by our Comparative Power to another; Wherefore, there must be some <hi>Ground</hi> in the Thing for our thus referring in; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, if the Relation be <hi>new,</hi> or such a one as before <hi>was not,</hi> there must be some <hi>Novelty</hi> in the Thing it self to <hi>ground</hi> it. Whence follows that, if there be such a Real Ground on the one side only, and <hi>no</hi> Real Ground on the other, there will be a <hi>Real</hi> Relation on the one side, and <hi>no Real</hi> Relation on the other, but only a <hi>Verbal</hi> one, or an <hi>Extrinsecal Denominatien;</hi> Answering, or (as it were) Chiming Grammatically to the Term which is <hi>really</hi> Relative, <hi>v. g.</hi> Our Powers of <hi>Seeing</hi> or <hi>Understanding</hi> any thing, have a <hi>Real Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> to their proper Objects; both because such Objects <hi>Specifie</hi> the Power, or make it <hi>such</hi> a Power, that is, give it its peculiar or distinct <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;</hi> as also, because the Power is by the Object <hi>actuated</hi> and <hi>determin'd</hi> to act; that is, the Power is <hi>intrinsecally Chang'd,</hi> or <hi>otherwise</hi> than it was, by means of the <hi>Object;</hi> but the Object suffers <hi>no</hi> kind of <hi>Change,</hi> nor is it at all <hi>Alter'd,</hi> or <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:95549:149"/>
than it was by being <hi>known</hi> or <hi>seen.</hi> Whence the Intellective or Visive <hi>Powers</hi> are <hi>really</hi> Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Object;</hi> but the Objects, for want of a <hi>Real Ground,</hi> are <hi>not</hi> really Related back to the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; however the Words <hi>[Understood]</hi> or <hi>[seen,]</hi> do Verbally answer to the Acts of <hi>Understanding</hi> and <hi>Seeing;</hi> which is, therefore, call'd by the Schools in their barbarous Language <hi>[Relatio de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici]</hi> or an Extrinsecal Denomination. For far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Light in this very necessary Particular, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer my Reader to my <hi>Method, Book</hi> 1. <hi>Less.</hi> 7. where, if I flatter not my self, he will find the Notion of <hi>Relation</hi> treated of very fully and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Especially I recommend to his Perusal the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th Section, where I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of that <hi>Unmutual</hi> Relation of <hi>the Measure to the Thing measured;</hi> the exact Knowledge of which is far more useful than any other piece of this Subject; however it lay out of Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Road to take notice of such Speculations as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, or not regard, the <hi>Thing</hi> as their Ground.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Reviewing his 26th Chapter, <hi>(of Cause and Effect, &amp;c.)</hi> I found that he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us very exactly, how we <note place="margin">What <hi>Causality is,</hi> and what grounds the Relations of <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Effect.</hi>
                  </note> gain the <hi>Ideas</hi> of them by our Senses; but he proceeds not to show us, (which yet he often does in other occasions) in what the nature of <hi>Causality</hi> consists, which is of the Chiefest use in Philosophy. For, what is the Learned part of the World the better, for having those <hi>rudest Draughts,</hi> or (as Mr. <hi>L.</hi> well calls them) <hi>materials</hi> of Knowledge, <hi>Ideas</hi> or <hi>Notions,</hi> or for knowing how we <hi>come by them,</hi> (in which he very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently terminates his Enquiries,) if we do not by
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:95549:149"/>
Reflexion and Reason, <hi>polish</hi> and <hi>refine</hi> them, and thence attain to true Knowledge of the Things, from which we glean'd them; or by what virtue they come to be <hi>Causes</hi> of such <hi>Effects?</hi> What I conceive of <hi>Causality</hi> is, that 'tis the Power of Participating or Communicating some <hi>Thing,</hi> or some <hi>mode</hi> of Thing, to the Patient, which was before some way or other, in the Thing that <hi>caus'd</hi> it: On which point I have no occasion to to dilate here particularly. Only, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns our present purpose, I am to note, that that which is thus <hi>communicated</hi> is the <hi>Real Ground</hi> on which the <hi>Real</hi> Relation of the <hi>Effect</hi> to its <hi>Cause</hi> is founded. Whence follows, that the <hi>Cause</hi> also, when it has some <hi>Real Change,</hi> by being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the <hi>Imperfecter</hi> State of meer <hi>Power,</hi> to the <hi>Perfecter</hi> one of <hi>Act,</hi> or (as we say) <hi>gets some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> by producing such an Effect, will have a <hi>Real Ground,</hi> and Consequently a <hi>Real Relation to</hi> the Effect, and <hi>not otherwise.</hi> And hence it is that <hi>God,</hi> our <hi>Creatour,</hi> has no <hi>Real Relation</hi> to his <hi>Creatures,</hi> tho' they have <hi>many</hi> to <hi>him;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is no <hi>otherwise,</hi> nor better, in the least, by Creating them, than he had been in Case he had not Created any thing at all; and therefore there is no Ground in <hi>Him</hi> of a Real Correlation to <hi>them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The 27th Chapter <hi>(of Identity and Diversity)</hi> requires a deeper Consideration. In order to which, I know no <note place="margin">The Knowing the <hi>Principle of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuation,</hi> must anteceede the Knowledge of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentity</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity.</hi>
                  </note> more Compendious way to clear the Point in dispute between us, than to fetch my Discourse from those Principles that concern it. The Subject does, indeed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:95549:150"/>
belong to Metaphysicks; but I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do what I can, to avoid those Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted <hi>Mediums,</hi> which are made use of in that Supreme Science. And, first, as the Ground work of my Discourse, I am to settle the <hi>Principle of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuation,</hi> or how a particular <hi>Thing</hi> or <hi>Substance,</hi> comes <hi>to be what it is;</hi> for, this done, it will be easily seen whence we are to take our Measures, to judge when it <hi>continues</hi> the <hi>same,</hi> and when it is to be <hi>another,</hi> or a Different Thing from its <hi>former self.</hi> I discourse thus; nor will it be Tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous I hope to repeat often, what is so <hi>Useful</hi> to be remember'd, as being the sure Ground of <hi>all</hi> our Knowledge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All our Conceptions, by which only we can discourse of Things, are either of <hi>Res</hi> or <hi>Modus rei;</hi> that is, they <note place="margin">What gives the Ground to <hi>Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy</hi> all Notions.</note> are either the Notions of <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Thing</hi> precisely; or else, the Notions of <hi>Accidents.</hi> Of these the Word <hi>[Thing]</hi> has a very <hi>Abstracted</hi> Notion, and is perfectly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different and Indeterminate to all Particulars: Wherefore the Notion of <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>sort</hi> of Thing, being (as was said above) <hi>more Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate,</hi> must have something <hi>superadded</hi> to it to determin it, and <hi>compound</hi> or constitute it of <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Species;</hi> which can be nothing but such a <hi>Complexion of Accidents</hi> or <hi>Modes;</hi> there being (as was said) nothing else imaginable that can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Notion of <hi>Thing.</hi> Now, Philosophers agreeing to call that which <hi>determins</hi> the common Notion of <hi>thing;</hi> and so, <hi>constitutes</hi> such and such <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>Kinds</hi> of Things <hi>[A Substantial</hi> or <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Form;]</hi> hence, the <hi>Substantial Form</hi> of all the <hi>Sorts, Kinds,</hi> or <hi>Species</hi> of Natural Bodies can be
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:95549:150"/>
nothing else but such a Complexion of Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as fit the Thing for <hi>such a kind</hi> of Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Nature. And, hitherto, if I mistake not, Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> and I may agree in the main, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may differ in the manner of Explicating our selves.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Descending then to the <hi>Individuals,</hi> it is evident, that a Greater Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion of Accidents is necessary to <note place="margin">What gives the Ground to our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduum.</hi>
                  </note> determine and constitute the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Individuums,</hi> than would serve to constitute the <hi>Species;</hi> for, the <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>Kinds</hi> of Things are but <hi>few,</hi> but the <hi>Individuums</hi> under those Kinds are <hi>Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable;</hi> and, therefore, <hi>more</hi> goes to distinguish <hi>these</hi> from one another, than was needful to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish or determine the <hi>other:</hi> Whence it comes, that we can never comprehend or reach all that belongs to the <hi>Suppositum,</hi> or <hi>Individuum.</hi> Wherefore, it being a certain Maxim, that [what <hi>distinguishes, does constitute,]</hi> this Medly of Innumerable Accidents, which <hi>differences</hi> or <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishes</hi> each Individuum from all the rest, does also intrinsecally <hi>constitute</hi> those <hi>Individuums;</hi> or, is the Intrinsecal or Formal <hi>Principle of Individua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Moreover, since nothing <hi>in Common,</hi> or not ultimately determin'd to be <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That,</hi> is <hi>capable of Existing;</hi> nor, consequently, in proper Speech, a <hi>Thing;</hi> it follows again, that that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of Acccidents, which gave the Thing its Primigenial Constitution in the very first Instant it was thus ultimately <hi>Determin'd</hi> to be <hi>This,</hi> (or Different from <hi>all others</hi> of the same Kind,) did truly and properly <hi>Individuate</hi> it. Note, that this Discourse holds equally in Elementary, Mix'd,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:95549:151"/>
Living, Vegetable and Animal <hi>Individuums;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing only for the smaller or greater Number of Accidents, which goes to the constituting each of them respectively. Why Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Complexion of Accidents to constitute the <hi>Specifick</hi> Nature, should not follow the same Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, in making a <hi>greater</hi> Complexion of the Modes <hi>Intrinsecally distinguish</hi> the <hi>Individuum</hi> from all others, and so constitute <hi>It,</hi> I cannot imagin; it being so perfectly Consonant, and necessarily Consequent to his own Doctrine, and agreeable to Evident Principles.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Applying then this Discourse to <hi>Man:</hi> Since it is the constant Method of God's Wisdom, as he is the Author of <note place="margin">How <hi>Individual Men</hi> are consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.</note> Nature, to carry on the Course of it by <hi>Dispositions</hi> on the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's side; and, therefore, to adjust and fit that which <hi>Supervenes</hi> to what <hi>Pre-exists;</hi> and, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, to sute the <hi>Form</hi> to the <hi>Matter;</hi> and, since 'tis evident that the <hi>Embrio pre-exists</hi> to the Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Soul, as the peculiar <hi>Matter</hi> to its <hi>Form;</hi> it follows, that the Soul is <hi>adjusted</hi> to the Bodily or <hi>Animal</hi> Part; and, according to the Degree, that part of it, call'd the <hi>Fancy,</hi> is better or worse fitted (as far as is on its side) to perform such Actions, when it is ripe; or, <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> fit to work <hi>comparatively,</hi> (in which all Judging and Discoursing <note n="*" place="margin">Method to Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, B. 2.

And, were it otherwise, so that the Soul were apt to work <hi>more perfectly</hi> than the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy were able to go along with it; first, that

                  <hi>greater</hi> Degree of Rationality in the Soul would be <hi>lost,</hi> and <hi>in vain;</hi> and next, the <hi>Man,</hi> God's Workmanship, would be <hi>disproportion'd,</hi> and, in a manner, <hi>Monstrous</hi> in his most Essential Parts. Putting then those Parts orderly fitted to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which can only be done (as was shewn) by suting the <hi>Supervening</hi> Part to that which <hi>pre-existed,</hi> it follows necessarily, that as the Bodily or (meerly) Animal <hi>Matter</hi> of Man, the <hi>Embryo,</hi> was, in the Instant before the Soul was infused, (and the <hi>Man</hi> made,) <hi>individually</hi> different from all of the same Kind, or from all other <hi>Embryo's;</hi> and so, was, consequently, just to <hi>such a Degree,</hi> fit, by the peculiar Disposition of its Brain, (as its conjoin'd Instrument,) to act with the Soul <hi>comparatively;</hi> so, it is impossible (the <hi>Soul</hi> being proportion'd to <hi>that</hi> Matter, as its <hi>Form)</hi> that any <hi>two</hi> Souls should be perfectly <hi>Alike,</hi> or <hi>Equal</hi> in Rationality; or rather, that any Two <hi>Men</hi> should have a Capacity of Knowing, or Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the <hi>self-same Degree:</hi> For, were they <hi>equally Rational,</hi> those <hi>two</hi> Men would be but <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> Man <hi>Essentially,</hi> or under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such a <hi>Species;</hi> in regard that, tho' they might have many Accidental Differences, yet they would have nothing in the Line of <hi>such a Rational Ens,</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> to distinguish them <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,</hi> or make and constitute them formally <hi>Two</hi> such Entities, or <hi>Things,</hi> as we call <hi>Men,</hi> or <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Animals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. This premis'd, I come to examin Mr. <hi>L</hi>'s Discourses upon this Subject. He imagins <hi>Existence is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Existence <hi>cannot possibly be the</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple <hi>of</hi> Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duation.</note> 
                  <hi>of Individuation;</hi> which can consist with no show of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:95549:152"/>
Reason. For, since <hi>Thing in Common</hi> cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist, and therefore what's Ultimately determin'd to be <hi>this</hi> Thing, or an <hi>Individuum,</hi> can <hi>only</hi> be capable of <hi>Actual Being;</hi> 'tis evident that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Thing must, (in priority of Nature or Reason) be <hi>first</hi> constituted such, ere it can be <hi>capable of Existence.</hi> Wherefore 'tis impossible that Existence, consider it how we will, can be in any manner the <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Individuation,</hi> the constitution of the Individuum being presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to it. Again, since, as has been shown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, the Notion of <hi>a Thing,</hi> or an <hi>Individuum,</hi> (speaking of Creatures) is <hi>[Capable to be]</hi> 'tis impossible that <hi>Actual Being,</hi> or <hi>Existence,</hi> should constitute the <hi>Potentiality</hi> or <hi>Capacity</hi> of <hi>Being,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more then the <hi>meer Power</hi> of walking can constitute or denominate a Man <hi>Actually walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Besides, both Logick and Metaphysicks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate that, <hi>Existence,</hi> it being the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Effect of the first Cause, who is Essentially an <hi>Infinitly-Pure Actuality of Being,</hi> is therefore the <hi>most Actual</hi> of any Notion we have, or can have. Wherefore, since whatever does <hi>difference</hi> or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish Another, must necessarily be <hi>more Actual</hi> than the Notion Distinguish'd; it follows, that <hi>Existence</hi> is of its own Nature a most perfectly uniform and <hi>Undistinguishable</hi> Effect, that is <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> in all Creatures whatsoever, as far as concerns its <hi>own</hi> precise Nature or Notion: For Reflexion will inform us clearly, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Notion is <hi>Distinguishable</hi> is <hi>Potential;</hi> and that the <hi>Distinguishing</hi> Notion is <hi>more Actual</hi> than it. Since then no Notion can be <hi>more Actual</hi> than is that of <hi>Existence;</hi> it follows, it cannot possibly be <hi>Distinguish'd</hi> at all. Whence follows
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:95549:152"/>
this Unexpected, tho' Clear, Consequence, that, if Existence does <hi>constitute</hi> the Individuality, all the Individuums in the world, as having <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>Self-same</hi> Constituter, would be but <hi>one Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Next, Mr. <hi>L.</hi> fancies, that the Existing of a Thing in the same <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> constitutes the <hi>Identity</hi> of a Thing; <note place="margin">The Outward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> cannot conduce to constitute the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>

Nor can we separate, even by our thought, one of those Considerations from another, unless we take the word <hi>[Substance]</hi> or <hi>[Man]</hi> in a Generical, or Specifical Meaning for <hi>Substance,</hi> and <hi>Man in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> which we are forbid to do by our very Subject in hand, which is about the Principle of <hi>Individuation;</hi> or else, unless he takes <hi>Substance</hi> for Parts of <hi>Matter,</hi> with their Quantity and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure acceding and deceding to the <hi>Individuum;</hi> which Things are not Essential to <hi>Man,</hi> nor fit

him for his Primary Operation; which Position follow'd home, would, perhaps, make the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduality of <hi>Man,</hi> and of all Things else, alter every Moment. So that Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> led by the different Sound of Words, makes Three Notions of One; and then racks his Wits to shew how this One Notion, made into Three, is distinguish'd; which we may easily foretell must render his Discourse very Extravagant, as will be seen shortly.</p>

Perhaps he may have had Second Thoughts since he writ his 19th Chapter, where, § 4. he thought it probable that <hi>Thinking is but the Action and not the Essence of the Soul.</hi> His Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son here is, <hi>Because 'tis impossible for any to perceive, without perceiving that he does perceive.</hi> Which I have shewn <note n="*" place="margin">Reflex. 2. § 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> above to be <hi>so far</hi> from Impossible, that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> is such. But, to speak to the Point: <hi>Consciousness</hi> of any <hi>Action</hi> or other Accident we have now, or have had, is nothing but our <hi>Knowldge</hi> that it belong'd to us; and, since we both agree that we have no <hi>Innate Knowledges,</hi> it follows, that all both A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and Habitual Knowledges which we have, are <hi>Acquir'd</hi> or <hi>Accidental</hi> to the Subject or <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> Wherefore the Man, or that Thing which is to be the <hi>Knower,</hi> must have had Individuality or Personality from <hi>other</hi> Principles, <hi>antecedently</hi> to this Knowledge call'd <hi>Consciousness;</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he will <hi>retain</hi> his Identity, or continue the <hi>same Man,</hi> or (which is equivalent) the <hi>same Person,</hi> as long as he <hi>has</hi> those <hi>Individuating Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi> What those Principles are which consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted this <hi>Man,</hi> or This Knowing <hi>Individuum,</hi> I have shewn above, § § 6, 7.

               <p n="13">13. Yet it is a great Truth, that Consciousness of its own Actions is <hi>Inseparable</hi> from a <hi>Knowing Individual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>

Whence it comes, that a Soul not only knows her self as soon as separated, (or rather, <hi>is</hi> then her own <hi>First,</hi> and most <hi>Immediate,</hi> and <hi>Ever-most-present</hi> Object,) but also, because, she <hi>then</hi> knowing all the Course of the World, and, consequently, all the Actions of her past Life, both Good and Bad, is disposed, by the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>former,</hi> and by the Consequences of them, laid by <hi>God</hi>'s Mercy or Justice, to erect her self by <hi>Hope</hi> to an Ardent and Over-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Love</hi> of her true Last End, which will <hi>save</hi> her; or, by her Knowledge, or the Conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Latter,</hi> to sink into <hi>Despair,</hi> which will plunge her into a Hell of Endless Misery.

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:95549:155"/>
it proves the direct contrary: For, it shews that our Person, or Individual <hi>Self,</hi> affected thus agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, or disagreeably, is the <hi>Object</hi> of that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness;</hi> and <hi>Objects</hi> must be <hi>antecedent</hi> and <hi>pre-supposed</hi> to the <hi>Acts</hi> which are employ'd about them, because the Objects are the <hi>Cause</hi> of those <hi>Acts.</hi> Nor is there any farther Mystery in the Word <hi>[Self;]</hi> for it means no more but <hi>our own same Intelligent Individuum,</hi> with which we are well acquainted, partly by <hi>Direct,</hi> partly by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex</hi> Knowledges.</p>
               <p n="14">14. It looks so very odly to say, that one of our own <hi>Acts</hi> should constitute our own particular <hi>Essence,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Yet <hi>Angels,</hi> who are <hi>Pure Acts,</hi> are constituted, in part, by the <hi>Act</hi> of Knowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</note> (which it must do, if our <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Identity</hi> consists in our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness,)</hi> that I am apt to think that Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s great Wit aim'd at some other Truth, tho' he hap'd to mis-apply it.

                  </note> and wrongly supposed Grounds, which occasion'd his Mistakes.

under it do <hi>agree,</hi> and which makes them <hi>one</hi> in Nature, should clear the Distinction of <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals,</hi> is altogether inexplicable. It must then be only the <hi>Individual Idea,</hi> or Notion, as far as we can reach it, (to which there go <hi>more</hi> Modes, than to the <hi>Specifical,)</hi> and its <hi>Intrinsecal Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi> which can <hi>diversifie</hi> Things <hi>Really,</hi> or make them to be <hi>Really</hi> the <hi>same,</hi> or <hi>Divers:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, some Outward Circumstances can do it, <hi>quoad nos.</hi> I am not much surpriz'd, that Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> led by the Common Doctrine, does think there are no <note place="margin">The Notion of the <hi>Individuum</hi> is <hi>Essential.</hi>

Lastly, I observe, that, to make good his Distinction of <hi>[Person,]</hi> from the Individual <hi>Substance,</hi> and Individual <hi>Man,</hi> he alledges, that a Hand cut off, the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> is vanish'd.

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:95549:157"/>
of some Organiz'd Part: Whereas, taking the Word <hi>[Substance,]</hi> as he ought, for <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>Thing,</hi> no Alteration or Defalcation of <hi>Matter,</hi> Quantity, or Figure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> makes it <hi>Another Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> or <hi>Another Thing;</hi> but such a Complexion of Accidents, or such a <hi>New Form,</hi> as makes it <hi>unfit</hi> for its <hi>Primary Operation,</hi> to which it is ordain'd, as it is a Distinct Part in Nature.

by way of <hi>Demonstration;</hi> in others, by a kind of <hi>Practical Evidence,</hi> from their observing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and Constant Order of the World, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the Celestial Bodies; as likewise by their Scanning, according to their different Pitch, the Solid Grounds of the Christian Religion Reveal'd to us by <hi>God, <hi>viz.</hi>

many kinds, do attend the Breach of those Laws, instituted for the Universal Good of the World; and, how all the Course of our Life is dis-joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and out of Frame, when we once yield the Conduct of it to Passion and Vice. Lastly, 'Tis this Light of True Reason, which makes those who are conscious to themselves that they have deviated enormously from this Rule, look upon themselves as Debauchers and Deserters of their Reason, which is their <hi>Nature;</hi> as Breakers and Contemners of the Law (not of the Land, but) of the <hi>World,</hi> and Disregarders of the Law-giver himself; as Base, Mean, Corrupted, and Rotten at the Heart, Degenerate from their own true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and, therefore, (unless they reform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,) utterly uncapable of being promoted to that Perfection and Happiness, to which the ever ready Generosity of their Infinitely-Bountiful <hi>God</hi> and Maker, would otherwise advance them; and, moreover, as Liable to all those most Dreadful Punishments, which the Anger of so great a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, justly provok'd, will certainly inflict on them. Whence ensues Interior Heart-gnawing Sorrow, and Stings of Conscience; and, if they persist, Despair and Damnation. These Things consider'd, and <hi>Virtue</hi> being Nothing but <hi>Right Reason</hi> (Man's true Nature) employ'd about Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Objects, in Fitting Occasions, I do not think we are to attend to what Irrational Men, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, or Humourists call <hi>Virtue</hi> or <hi>Vice,</hi> and esteem <hi>Laudable</hi> or <hi>Blameable;</hi> but to what <hi>Right Reason,</hi> the <hi>only Establish'd</hi> and <hi>Impartial Standard</hi> in this Case, teaches us to be <hi>truly such:</hi> And, I think it had been better, and more unexceptionable, to have called such good and bad Dispositions <hi>[Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted</hi>

For, what are <hi>Names,</hi> but the Words which <hi>signifie</hi> those <hi>Ideas?</hi> The <hi>Idea,</hi> then, is in my Mind, <hi>what it is,</hi> and <hi>such as it is,</hi> inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently of those <hi>Names;</hi> as being there <hi>before</hi> I named it. And the same Reason holds, for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Distinction of those <hi>Ideas;</hi> for the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will be still what they were, whether <hi>one</hi> Name or <hi>Another</hi> be imposed on them: And, I think Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> agrees with me, that they are like Figures, which, the least detracted, or added, makes the <hi>Idea</hi> be quite <hi>another.</hi> If one talks to me of a <hi>Mufti,</hi> and I take that Word to signifie a <hi>Rat-catcher,</hi> my <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Rat-catcher</hi> is the same as if the Word <hi>[Rat-catcher]</hi> had been used, tho' the <hi>Reference</hi> of the <hi>Idea</hi> to that Name be as wrong as may be. Or, if I speak of an <hi>Individuum,</hi> called <hi>Longinus,</hi> and another takes that Word to signifie a <hi>Yard;</hi> my <hi>Idea</hi> is <hi>confused,</hi> being of an <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duum;</hi> and his <hi>Distinct,</hi> tho' the <hi>Word</hi> be the <hi>same.</hi> So if the same Person, rectify'd as to the Meaning of any Word, takes it <hi>now</hi> in a different Sense than he did <hi>formerly,</hi> then he has another <hi>Idea</hi> by it than he had; but yet, both his <hi>former,</hi> and his <hi>New-got Idea</hi> are still unalterably and perfectly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct. But, I observe, that Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> attributes many Things to <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Names;</hi> which, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:95549:160"/>
it be his Over-acuteness, or my Dulness, I can make nothing of. What I conceive of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd Ideas,</hi> is this: In two Cases chiefly they are <hi>Confus'd, viz.</hi> when there is a Confusion in the Things themselves from which they are taken, and to which they Correspond; as, when too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Considerabilities are blended together (as it were) in the same <hi>Suppositum,</hi> or <hi>Individuum;</hi> or, that the Object it self consists of <hi>Many</hi> Things; as, a Heap, an Army, a Sack of Wheat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or else, when the Object is not well represented, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Defect of the Organ, the Distance of the Object, or the ill Disposition of the <hi>Medium.</hi> To this latter sort belongs the Imperfection of our Understanding; which, not able to comprehend the whole <hi>Thing,</hi> is forced to make many Inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate <hi>Ideas</hi> or Notions of it; which, not reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>particularize</hi> the Thing, must therefore be <hi>Common,</hi> or General, as containing more under them <hi>Indeterminately,</hi> that is, <hi>Confusedly.</hi> In two Cases also, <hi>Names</hi> seem to cause in us Confused <hi>Ideas:</hi> One, when the Word is <hi>perfectly Equivocal,</hi> and signifies neither Sense <hi>determinately.</hi> The other, when a Multitude of Words are huddled together <hi>inartificially,</hi> or stammer'd out <hi>unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly;</hi> to which we may add, our not understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Language thorowly. In which Cases, we have either no Notion at all, or, if any, a very <hi>Confused</hi> one. And these seem to me the only so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Ways to breed <hi>Confused Ideas,</hi> as being taken from the Nature of the <hi>Things,</hi> and of their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances; and from the Nature of the <hi>Words,</hi> as <hi>Words;</hi> that is, from their <hi>Significativeness.</hi> As for the <hi>Secret and Unobserved References,</hi> the Author speaks of, <hi>which the Mind makes of its Ideas</hi> to such

Names, I must confess, I know not what it means, more than that the Understanding knows perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or imperfectly, what the Word stands for, or (which is the same) what is its <hi>true</hi> and proper <hi>Meaning.</hi> Concerning <hi>Infinity,</hi> of all sorts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I have said enough formerly, on divers Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>

4. Moreover, there is <hi>another</hi> Reason, of a <hi>higher</hi> Nature, and most Supream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wise, grounded on what the <note place="margin">The Metaphysical Reason why this <hi>Complexion of Accidents</hi> which constitutes <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduums,</hi> should be almost infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely various.</note> Metaphysicians term <hi>Altissimae Causae,</hi> which we call <hi>First Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> why this Complexion of Accidents should be so <hi>Numerous,</hi> and Millions of Ways variable. It becomes the <hi>God</hi> of Truth, so to order his World, that Things should be a <hi>Ground for Truth.</hi> Now, had there not been almost as Infinite Variety of those Modes which constitute, and, consequently, <hi>distinguish,</hi> every <hi>Individuum;</hi> it might happen, there being such an innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Multitude of those Individual <hi>Things,</hi> that some <hi>Two</hi> of them, which, by being <hi>Two,</hi> must be <hi>Different,</hi> would yet <hi>differ in nothing,</hi> or in no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, or Mode; and so, they would be <hi>One,</hi> and not <hi>One;</hi> which is a Contradiction. Nay, not only divers <hi>Things,</hi> but each Discernable and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>same</hi> Thing, however seeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Uniform, must have a <hi>various</hi> Complexion of those Modes, to <hi>distinguish them.</hi> For Example; Let a <hi>20s.</hi> Piece of Gold be divided into Forty Parts; each Part, after <hi>Division,</hi> being now a <hi>Whole,</hi> and a <hi>Distinct Thing</hi> from all the rest, must either have some <hi>Distinct Modes</hi> in it, to <hi>distinguish</hi> it from all the others, or it would be <hi>Distinct,</hi> and yet <hi>Not distinct,</hi> (having nothing to distinguish it;) that is, it would be <hi>One Thing,</hi> and yet <hi>Not one Thing;</hi> or rather, the <hi>same Part,</hi> and yet <hi>Not the same Part;</hi> and this <hi>in the same respect, (viz.</hi> under the Notion of <hi>Substance, Thing,</hi> or <hi>Part;)</hi> which is a perfect Contradiction. Wherefore, the <hi>God</hi> of Nature, who is always <hi>Essential Truth,</hi> has so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:95549:161"/>
it, that Things, and each part of Things, how minute soever, should have a Ground in them of <hi>differing from one another,</hi> as whoever is used to Microscopes, will easily discover. As for what concerns <hi>us,</hi> this Inconceivable Variety tasks our Industry, employs our Speculation, and raises our Contemplation, by making us see that <hi>God</hi>'s Wisdom is infinitely exalted in the <hi>least</hi> of his Creatures; and by obliging us to break out into Transports of Admiration, <note n="*" place="margin">Job 36. 26.</note>

Lastly, Since there are the highest Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons imaginable, that this Individual Complexion
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:95549:162"/>
of Accidents should be impossible to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by us in this State; let us content our selves with this sufficient Knowledge which we have of them, without grasping foolishly at more than we are able to fathom.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In my Judgment this Acute Author might have excused this 32th Chapter, <hi>[Of True and False Ideas.]</hi> He <note place="margin">No Formal Truth or Falshood in <hi>Ideas</hi> or Notions.</note> grants they cannot <hi>properly</hi> be True or False <hi>in themselves;</hi> and <hi>Ideas or Notions,</hi> being nothing but the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Thing (as thus or thus conceiv'd) in our Minds, can have no Consideration belonging to them, but what they <hi>are in themselves,</hi> or that they <hi>are what they are,</hi> which is called their <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical Verity;</hi> and therefore (as he says well) they <hi>can no more be True or False, than a single Name can be said to be such.</hi> The Improper Truth or Falshood which he seems willing to attribute to them, belongs (as he also intimates) to <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> that is, to the <hi>Connexions</hi> of his <hi>Ideas,</hi> and not to the <hi>Ideas</hi> or Notions themselves, which are the <hi>Parts</hi> that are capable to be connected. But, if <hi>This</hi> Truth or Falshood (which Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> would force his Reason to shew,) can <hi>any way</hi> belong to them, it will not be <hi>Improperly</hi> but <hi>Properly</hi> such; for Truth and Falshood are <hi>most properly</hi> found in <hi>Judgments,</hi> and <hi>only</hi> in them. Wherefore, either <hi>no</hi> Formal Truth or Falshood <hi>at all</hi> can belong to <hi>Ideas,</hi> or it must be <hi>Proper</hi> Truth or Falshood; which is what the Author denies, as contrary to his Intention.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IN the 5th Section of the First Chapter, the Grounds are well laid to shew how <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical</hi> and Improper Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Names come; and how <note place="margin">Whence <hi>Proper</hi> and <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Notions and Words have their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</note> they are <hi>Translated</hi> from those Notions which arise from Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression on the Senses. For, to have <hi>Senses</hi> being common to all Mankind; and, withall, they being, (with a very small difference) apt to be affected by Objects after the <hi>same manner,</hi> the Notions thus imprinted are <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Common;</hi> and, therefore, the Words that Men agree on, or by Use establish, to signifie such Notions, are <hi>Proper;</hi> the Universal
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:95549:163"/>
Use of them, and the General Consent that they should signifie those Natural Notions, making them current, and giving them this Propriety. Whereas, the Notions we have of Spiritual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and of the Operations of our Mind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by it, not being <hi>imprinted Naturally,</hi> but got by <hi>Reflexion,</hi> have no Words or Names which Mankind agrees to call them by. Whence we are forced to make use of our Natural Notions and Expressions, (with some Additions annex'd, to shew their Difference) to signifie our <hi>Reflex Ideas;</hi> and, therefore, the Conceptions we have of <hi>such Natures,</hi> and consequently the <hi>Names</hi> by which we signifie them, being <hi>Transferr'd</hi> from the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> ones to them, are called <hi>Metaphorical.</hi>
               </p>

As for Rules to know the right Sense of Words, as far as relates to Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, there can be but Two in <note place="margin">The General Rules to know the right Sense of Words.</note> General, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Sense of Those Words or Names which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press our Natural Notions, which are common to all Mankind, is to be taken from the Vulgar;</hi> and, <hi>the Sense of Artificial Words from the Masters in those respective Arts;</hi> these Two sorts of Men being the <hi>Framers</hi> and <hi>Authors,</hi> as it were, of those two sorts of <hi>Language;</hi> and who, by their Imposing, Accepting, or Using of them in such a Sense, have stamp'd upon them their <hi>Proper</hi> Signification, and given it to be <hi>Sterling</hi> and <hi>Current;</hi> in which, and not in Etymologies or Criticisms only, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists the <hi>Propriety</hi> of Words. Nor can I see (Care being taken to avoid Equivocalness) what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inspection into the Nature of Words can be needful for a Philosopher. I say, in <hi>this</hi> Desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Agreement, and Usage of the Word,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:95549:163"/>
and <hi>only</hi> in <hi>this,</hi> consists all the <hi>Connexion</hi> or <hi>Tying</hi> the <hi>Ideas</hi> to the Words, and those <hi>Secret References</hi> of the former to the other, of which Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> speaks so often in his Second Chapter, and other places; nor can it consist in any thing else.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Indeed those Words which express <hi>Artificial</hi> Notions are most liable to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken; because Artists have the <note place="margin">Words of <hi>Art</hi> most liable to be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> Prerogative of Coining their own Words, and of Affixing to them what Signification they please. Whence, if their <hi>Thoughts</hi> differ, the Words that express them must needs be Equivocal or Double-sensed. For all <hi>Art</hi> being nothing but <hi>Reflexion on Nature,</hi> polish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perfecting those rude Draughts given us by our Mother-wit to an Exactness, and Reflexions being <hi>Various</hi> in divers Men, according to their Degree of Skill, and their Talent of Penetrating the Nature of the Object they are employ'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; the same Univocalness of Signification is not to be expected in those Words that express our <hi>Reflex</hi> Thoughts, as in those by which we notifie our <hi>Direct</hi> ones, in which all Mankind (as was shewn) do agree. This chiefly happens in many <hi>Logical</hi> Words; for the Notions that Art makes use of, being wholly built on the <hi>manner of Existing</hi> the Thing has in <hi>our Understanding,</hi> which none but Steady, Solid and Acute Reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters can perfectly discern; hence, <hi>those</hi> Reflex <hi>Notions,</hi> and consequently the <hi>Names</hi> which are to signifie them, become liable to Ambiguity; which has, doubtless, been the Occasion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fruitless Contests; which end (if they ever end at all) in <hi>Word-Skirmishes.</hi>

4. Yet, it will not be hard to prevent, or avoid, all Mistake even in <hi>these,</hi> if we do but attend heedfully to the <note place="margin">The way how to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void being mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <hi>Words</hi> of <hi>Art.</hi>

                  <hi>Manners</hi> by which those things <hi>exist in our Minds,</hi> and take the Sense of those Words from the ablest Artists, or best Reflecters. For Nature (if we do not relinquish it) and familiar Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will make them easy to be understood. For example, let it be told us by a Logician, that the <hi>Species</hi> is the <hi>lowest</hi> and <hi>Narrowest</hi> sort of Common Notions, that have none under them but <hi>Individuals;</hi> and it will be presently seen that the Conception we call <hi>[Man]</hi> (thus apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and exprest) is a <hi>Specifical</hi> Notion. Let it be told us again, that a <hi>Genus</hi> is a Larger Notion which has divers <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>Sorts</hi> under it; and, it will quickly appear that <hi>[Animal]</hi> is a <hi>Generi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Notion; Or, if a Logician acquaints us, that a <hi>Proposition</hi> is a Speech which <hi>affirms</hi> or <hi>denies;</hi> and that that part of it <hi>which is affirm'd</hi> (or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd)</hi> is call'd by Men of Art the <hi>Predicate,</hi> and that part <hi>of which</hi> 'tis affirm'd or deny'd, is the <hi>Subject;</hi> and that <hi>which expresses</hi> the Affirmation or Negation is the <hi>Copula;</hi> and there can be no difficulty to know that this Speech <hi>(A Stone is hard)</hi> is a <hi>Proposition;</hi> that <hi>[Stone]</hi> is the <hi>Subject, [Hard]</hi> the <hi>Predicate,</hi> and [is] the <hi>Copula;</hi> and so in all the rest, if a Right Reflecter have the management of them. But, care is to be taken that we do not pin our belief upon Authors, who frame Artificial Notions out of their <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> without regard to the <hi>Thing</hi> as 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by our Understanding, or according to the Manner <hi>it is there;</hi> for, then, we shall quite
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:95549:164"/>
lose the solid Grounds of <hi>Nature,</hi> and let our Wits loose to follow their Butterfly <hi>Fancies;</hi> For, that <hi>Thing</hi> call'd <hi>[Man,]</hi> as thus conceived, is <hi>as truly</hi> a <hi>Species,</hi> and <hi>[Animal]</hi> a <hi>Genus,</hi> consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it <hi>as it is in our Understanding</hi> with such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Abstraction, as an <hi>Individual</hi> Man, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting <hi>in re,</hi> or <hi>out of the Understanding,</hi> is Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legg'd, or a Horse four-footed. And, for the same Reason, 'tis as evident to true Logicians, or right Reflecters, that in the Proposition now mentioned, there are as truly, really, necessarily and essentially those <hi>Three</hi> parts lately spoken of, as 'tis to a Mathematician, that there are three Corners in a Triangle: The same Reason, I say, holds for both; for the Soul is as really a <hi>Thing,</hi> as the Bodies <hi>in Nature;</hi> and <hi>her</hi> Modes, or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, and their Manners of Existing, are as <hi>Real,</hi> as those of any Bodies are, or can be, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more. Whence 'tis Evident also that, in the Proposition now mentioned, the <hi>Thing</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly conceiv'd, or its <hi>Modes,</hi> are <hi>truly</hi> and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Subject, Predicate and Copula in the Mind; and that, tho' they be exprest in <hi>Logical</hi> Terms, they do not put off their Natures, or Notions, which were <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>Naturally</hi> imprinted on the Understanding; but are only super-vested with an Artificial Dress, thrown over them by our Reflexion: For, otherwise, we could not say the Thing call'd <hi>[A Stone]</hi> is <hi>hard,</hi> but we must withal mean and say <hi>[the Subject is the Predicate]</hi> in case not the <hi>Natural</hi> Notion of the Thing, but only the <hi>Logical</hi> Notion were predicated; Nor could the former of these two Propositions be <hi>True,</hi> the Later, <hi>False,</hi> if the <hi>Thing</hi> it self, or its <hi>Modes</hi> were not the Materials that Compounded it.</p>

From default of this Consideration springs all the Wordishness, and empty Disputes among trivial Philosophers; of which Mr. <hi>L.</hi> does, with good Reason, so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Complain.

Notwithstanding, in regard some pretended Schollers have on divers occasions us'd <hi>Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and even <hi>Common</hi> Words variously, I have thought fit to add a Fifth Preliminary, to show what Sense the Chief Words us'd in Philosophy must have; and that they <hi>can</hi> signify no other.

enumerating some certain <hi>Ideas,</hi> which, put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do make up the Sense of the Notion defin'd.

It will serve the Common People well enough to declare their Thoughts by <hi>huddling together</hi> many particular Considerations; nay, they will define even <hi>Individuums</hi> (if such as these may be call'd Definitions) by this Method, as <hi>Homer</hi> did <hi>Thersites.</hi> But the Point is, how <hi>Art,</hi> which is to <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>polish</hi> the Rudeness of raw Undisciplin'd Nature, ought to behave it self. <hi>Reflexion,</hi> the Parent of all Arts, teaches even Housewives and Lawyers, that 'tis very conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the one to put such and such Linnen into distinct Drawers; and, for the other to distribute all those Writings that concern different Businesses into distinct Boxes: And the same Faculty teaches Logicians also to range all their Notions (the Materials they are employ'd about) into distinct <hi>Common Heads,</hi> so to gain a <hi>Distinct</hi> Knowledge of each; which, they being innumerable, would otherwise lie mingled confusedly. This perform'd, what are they to do next? Must they hover still in these few common Heads of Notions? No, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly; for, then, they would not have enow of such <hi>more-particular</hi> Notions as are needful for Discourse. They must descend therefore from those Common Notions to more-particular ones under each of them; and this, as Plain Reason tells us, <hi>gradually:</hi> that is, they must <hi>divide</hi> those Common Heads by Immediate Distinctive No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

call'd <hi>Differences:</hi> for, were they not <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</hi> the Product of that Division could not be <hi>more</hi> Notions; whereas Division must (at least) make <hi>Two</hi> of <hi>One.</hi> And, whence must we take those Differences? From <hi>other</hi> Common Heads? No surely; for this would <hi>confound</hi> all our Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons again, which we had taken such Care to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish</hi> into those Heads, in case the <hi>more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> ones, or the respective <hi>Species,</hi> were made up of one Notion found in <hi>one</hi> Line, and of another found in another.

10. When Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> shall have leisurely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd each Step of this short Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, he will find that <hi>Nature</hi>

For, when he puts Man to be a <hi>Solid Extended Substance,</hi> should it be <hi>deny'd,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is but <hi>one</hi> part of Man (his <hi>Body)</hi> that is <hi>Solid</hi> and <hi>Extended,</hi> and not his <hi>Spiritual</hi> part, the <hi>Soul;</hi> his only Defence can be this, that those Words were meant only for the <hi>General</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or what was <hi>Common</hi> to Man and <hi>all</hi> other Bodies, (for which Reason, <hi>Substance</hi> there is the Highest <hi>Genus;)</hi> and that which follows is meant to <hi>difference</hi> or distinguish <hi>him</hi> from <hi>them.</hi> Next, it will be unanswerably objected, that Man being a <hi>Thing,</hi> or (which is the same) a <hi>Substance,</hi> which signifies meerly <hi>what's capable to be,</hi> and a Definition telling us the Essence of the Notion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd, he deviates manifestly from the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Laws of <hi>Art,</hi> by taking in such Differences to distinguish <hi>Substance, viz. Solidity</hi> and <hi>Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> which are <hi>Foreign</hi> to this Common Head of <hi>Being</hi> or <hi>Thing,</hi> and belong to other Common Heads, which are only <hi>Modes</hi> of Thing, <hi>viz.</hi> those of <hi>Quantity</hi> and <hi>Quality.</hi> Add, That this seems also to contradict his own Doctrin, <hi>(B.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. § 11, 12. and <hi>B.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap</hi> 6. § 21.) where he makes <hi>Extension</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> not to be the same.

constituting the Essence of <hi>Body,</hi> could not be said. Now, as was lately shewn, all these Rubs are avoided if we separate our Notions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Common Heads; and, by dividing those Heads by Intrinsecal Differences, at the same time make our Definitions of each Inferior Notion. Nor can it be objected, that <hi>we</hi> also use Extrinsecal Differences, while we divide Substance by <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> and <hi>Indivisible,</hi> and yet make Divisibility the Notion of <hi>Quantity;</hi> for, all such Exceptions are fore-stall'd in my <hi>Method, B.</hi> 1. <hi>Less.</hi> 3. and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, §§. 5. and 6.</p>

But, till the Best, and <hi>only</hi> Proper Way (which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd lately) to make Definitions be allow'd and taken, I am sure there will be no <hi>new</hi> ones made that will deserve that Name; and those <hi>Few</hi> that are already made, will still be exposed to the baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Attacks of Fancy. <hi>Aristotle</hi> was, certainly, the best Definer of any Philosopher yet extant; yet, his Definitions are excepted against by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Men; and (which is worse) for no other Reason, but because they are <hi>too Learned,</hi> that is, <hi>too Good.</hi> Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> expresses here great Dis-satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction at <hi>two</hi> of them; which, to my best Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not all the Wit of Man can mend. The First is. of <hi>Motion;</hi> which <hi>Aristotle</hi> defines to be <hi>Actus Entis in potentia, quatenus in potentia.</hi> Now, I wonder not that Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> who, in his large Chapter of <hi>Power,</hi> never so much as mention'd the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Power to be a Thing,</hi> nor <hi>the Power to have such an Accident,</hi> or <hi>Mode;</hi> nor, consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Idea</hi> of an <hi>Act</hi> answering to such a <hi>Power,</hi> should conceit this Definition to be Gibberish. However he came to pretermit them, it is most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that we have Natural <hi>Ideas</hi> or Notions of both these. We cannot see a Thing <hi>made actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Another,</hi> or <hi>Alter'd</hi> to be any way <hi>otherwise than it was;</hi> but Nature obliges us to see, and say, that that Thing, of which the new one was made, <hi>could,</hi> or <hi>had</hi> a <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>be, It,</hi> or have Another <hi>made of it.</hi> Or, when we see 'tis anew made Hot,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:95549:170"/>
Cold, Round, White, Moved, Placed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that it <hi>could,</hi> or had a <hi>Power</hi> to become such, ere it was <hi>Actually</hi> such. These <hi>Ideas</hi> then of <hi>Act</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> are so Natural, that Common Sense <hi>forces</hi> us to acknowledge them, and Common Language <hi>must</hi> use them: And 'tis a strange Fastidiousness, not to allow those Transcendent (that is, most Common, and most Clear) Words in <hi>Definitions,</hi> whose Notions or Meanings Nature gives us; and which Words, or Equivalent Expressions, Common Discourse forces us to use. Yet, in the Uncouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>these</hi> Words to some Men's Fancies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists all the Difficulty which they so boggle at in this Definition. The <hi>Ens,</hi> or Body, was only <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,</hi> or had a <hi>Power</hi> to be moved ere Motion came; and, now, by <hi>Motion</hi> it is <hi>Actually</hi> moved. It is evident then that Motion is the <hi>Act,</hi> or (which is the same) the <hi>Formal Cause,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced that <hi>Power</hi> into Act, or <hi>formally</hi> denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated it <hi>moved Actually. Act</hi> then, was a Proper <hi>Genus,</hi> as far as those <hi>most Common</hi> Notions can have one. Now comes the Difference <hi>[in poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,]</hi> which is, to determine what <hi>kind</hi> of Act Motion is. To understand which, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that a Body has many <hi>other</hi> Acts or (as we conceive and call them) <hi>Forms</hi> in it, such as are Quantity, Figure, and all Qualities what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; as, Roundness, Length, Breadth, Health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they are not Acts of that Body, as 'tis <hi>in power</hi> to be otherwise than it is, but as 'tis <hi>actually</hi> such or such: For, they truly deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate it to be <hi>actually</hi> Round, Long, Health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas, <hi>Motion,</hi> being formally a meer <hi>Tendency</hi> to an Effect <hi>not yet produced,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes and denominates a Body to be only in

I have, I hope, demonstrated in my Prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, that all our <hi>Ideas,</hi> or Notions, which are Solid, and not Fantastick, are nothing but several Conceptions of the <hi>Thing;</hi> or, which is the same (taking the Word <hi>[Conception]</hi> for the <hi>Object,</hi> and not for the <hi>Act</hi> of Conceiving) <hi>the Thing diversly conceiv'd.</hi> Hence all our Conceptions, or Notions, are <hi>Inadequate,</hi> especially if they be <hi>Distinct,</hi> and not <hi>Confused.</hi> Hence the most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted Notion we have, or can have, let it be Figure, Colour, Existence, or what other we please, even tho' signify'd by the most Abstract Term, is still the <hi>Thing</hi> consider'd precisely <hi>as</hi> having those Modes in it; in regard that, as those Modes, or Accidents, have no <hi>Entity</hi> of their <hi>own,</hi> but meerly that of the <hi>Thing</hi> which they affect, so they can have no <hi>Intelligibility,</hi> or Knowable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, (which is the Property of <hi>Entity)</hi> but as they are conceiv'd to belong to the <hi>Thing,</hi> or to be <hi>It:</hi> So that, (Hardness being that by which a Thing is <hi>formally</hi> Hard) neither would Hardness be Hardness, nor would Existence be Existence, if they were the Hardness or Existence, of <hi>Nothing;</hi> for No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can neither be <hi>hard,</hi> nor <hi>exist,</hi> nor have any other Affections belonging to it. Again, 'tis evident we can have no <hi>distinct</hi> Notion of the <hi>whole Ens,</hi> or <hi>Individuum;</hi> nor consequently of the <hi>Essence,</hi> (properly such) which is the Form that Constitutes the <hi>whole</hi> Ens: For this contains in it what grounds or Corresponds to great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Inadequate, or Partial Notions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains them <hi>blended</hi> (as it were) in the <hi>Thing</hi> as in their <hi>Root;</hi> and this so <hi>Confusedly</hi> and insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that only that most acute Divider, call'd <hi>Acies Intellectus,</hi> can take them a sunder, or sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

them. Moreover, there are not only <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd</hi> and <hi>Distinct</hi> Ideas, as Mr. <hi>L.</hi> acknowledges, but also (which I remember not he takes notice of,) Notions or <hi>Ideas</hi> which are <hi>more</hi> and <hi>less</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused or Distinct; or <hi>partly</hi> one, <hi>partly</hi> the other, and this with very great variety; as is seen in his Example of <hi>Gold,</hi> of which (and the same may be said of all other Bodies,) some Men gain by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees more distinct Knowledges than others do. To proceed, 'tis evident that, of all other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that of <hi>Existence</hi> has the least Composition in it that can be. Whence all <hi>Clearness</hi> of our Notions coming from their <hi>Distinctness,</hi> and their Distinctness Springing from their <hi>Simplicity,</hi> the formal Notion of <hi>Existence</hi> is the most <hi>Clear;</hi> that is, <hi>self-evident,</hi> and therefore <hi>Inexplicable;</hi> all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications being of those Notions that can <hi>need</hi> it. The Notion of <hi>Ens,</hi> which signifies <hi>Capable to Exist,</hi> has but a very little <hi>Composition,</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, <hi>Confusion</hi> in it, as consisting of <hi>Actual Being,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> to it, For the same Reason <hi>Corpus</hi> has <hi>more</hi> of Composition or Confusion in it, than <hi>Ens; Vivens</hi> than <hi>Corpus; Animal</hi> than <hi>Vivens; Homo</hi> than <hi>Animal;</hi> and <hi>Socrates,</hi> or the <hi>Individuum,</hi> most of all; There going still (as was shown above) more Notions to constitute and Compound each <hi>inferiour</hi> Notion than there does to constitute those <hi>above it;</hi> whence, still as they are <hi>more Compounded,</hi> they are proportionably <hi>more Confus'd,</hi> that is, <hi>less Distinct,</hi> or <hi>less Clear.</hi> The <hi>Ideas,</hi> or Notions, of <hi>Individuals</hi> therefore, or of <hi>particular</hi> Things, are for the reason now given the most <hi>Unintelligible;</hi> meaning by that Word, the most <hi>impossible to be comprehended all at once.</hi> This reflected on, and it being shown above, that
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:95549:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>
both Nature and Art instruct us to divide our Notions into Common Heads, and to proceed thus gradually to Inferiour ones; 'tis most evident that the <hi>only Proper</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> way of distinguishing our Notions into <hi>Simple</hi> and <hi>Compounded,</hi> is to be taken (not from our <hi>Fancy,</hi> what <hi>Ideas</hi> seem most Clear to us) but from this <hi>Gradual Progression</hi> from Superiour to Inferiour Notions; in regard there goes still <hi>more</hi> to compound the <hi>Inferiour</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than there does to compound the <hi>Superiour.</hi> Whence follows out of the very Terms that <hi>those</hi> must be <hi>more Compounded,</hi> or less Clear, these <hi>more Simple,</hi> and <hi>more Clear.</hi>

such a manner of <hi>Terminating</hi> it. And, the same may be easily shown of all the rest of his Simple <hi>Ideas</hi> whatever, excepting only that of <hi>Existence.</hi> From these Principles I make the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>First,</hi> That the <hi>Ideas</hi> can never be in fault when we <hi>name</hi> things wrong, but our own heedlesness or Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">The <hi>Idea</hi> or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can never be in Fault when we <hi>Name</hi> things <hi>wrong.</hi>

               <p n="20">20. <hi>Secondly, Confused Ideas,</hi> they being all <hi>Compounded,</hi> may have <hi>fewer</hi> or more <hi>Distinct Ideas</hi> annext to their <note place="margin">

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:95549:175"/>
little steps nearer to the making it an <hi>Adequate</hi> one.</p>
               <p n="21">21. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Since we know before-hand, that every Thing has a <hi>Distinct Nature</hi> or <hi>Real Essence</hi> peculiar to its self, <note place="margin">Confused Notions do not <hi>exclude,</hi> but <hi>include</hi> those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct ones which are yet <hi>Undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd.</hi>
                  </note> we take those <hi>most Remarkable</hi> Accidents intrinsecally belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, to be that Essence; especially if they do <hi>sufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish</hi> it from all other Natures; and, when we find they do not, we acknowledge our Judgment may be false, we strive to correct it, and suspend till we gain better Light; yet still our <hi>Notions</hi> are inerrably <hi>what they are,</hi> and fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, however it fares with our <hi>Judgment.</hi> Nor does our Judgment <hi>exclude</hi> the <hi>yet-undiscover'd</hi> Modes from the Notion of the Thing; but, we <hi>include</hi> them all in the Lump or <hi>Confusedly.</hi> Whence 'tis the <hi>Real Essence</hi> of the Thing which is known, tho' Imperfectly and Inadequately. Thus we know a Man and a Horse to be two Things of different <hi>Species</hi> by divers manifest Qualities which never agree to <hi>both</hi> of them, and therefore distinguish them; and, tho' 'tis the <hi>whole,</hi> or rather a <hi>Greater</hi> Complexion of Accidents which does constitute the Specifick Difference; yet even <hi>that</hi> is known <hi>truly,</hi> (tho' imperfectly) when we know it but <hi>in part,</hi> especially (as was said) when it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to distinguish one from the other: In the same manner as when I see but a Man's <hi>Hand</hi> or <hi>Face,</hi> I am truly said to see the <hi>Man,</hi> tho' <hi>[Man]</hi> signifies the <hi>whole,</hi> which I see but <hi>in part.</hi> The solid Reason of which is this Great Truth, that <hi>[There are no Actual Parts in any Compound what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.]</hi> Whence follows, that every <hi>Part</hi> is the

                  <hi>Appearances</hi> to our Fancy, but from the solid Grounds now spoken of, is seen farther by this Instance, that many Men are much distasted at the Notions belonging to Metaphysicks, such as are <hi>Being, Ens, Essence, Act, Power,</hi> and such like. The Reason of which is, that we do cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomarily <hi>reflect</hi> upon our Notions, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>define</hi> or <hi>explain</hi> them. Whence, in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical ones, finding this to be very Difficult, and in many of them Impossible, hence Men fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy them to be Inconceivable and Incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and thence they take a Toy at Metaphysicks, and pretend it insuperably <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>mysterious.</hi> Now it passes with these Reflecters, as it does with those that would look stedfastly on the Sun at Noon-day; they find a kind of Cloud hover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before their Eyes, and seem bedarken'd with too much Light. The Test to stick to in such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses is, to set themselves to <hi>define</hi> or explicate their Notions; which done, if they find they can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent no Notions <hi>more Clear</hi> than those Notions themselves are, they may be sure they are <hi>self-evident,</hi> and may safely look upon them as such; and, if they find they <hi>can</hi> be <hi>defin'd</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd,</hi> they may be sure there will be found in their Definition or Explication more Notions equivalent to that one; and thence they may be assur'd also that the Notion Defin'd or Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, has <hi>more Parts,</hi> or <hi>Composition</hi> in it; and, therefore, is not <hi>Simple</hi> nor perfectly <hi>Clear,</hi> since
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:95549:176"/>
it needs to be made Clear by others, which therefore must be <hi>more Simple</hi> and <hi>Clearer</hi> than It.</p>
               <p n="24">24. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It appears from what is said, that 'tis not <hi>to avoid different Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Words, that Men suppose</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Not the Design of avoiding diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Signification of Words, but plain Nature, forces us to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

For example; Speaking here, §. 19. of <hi>Shewing</hi> and <hi>Defining Substances;</hi> all which being Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, must have <hi>Real Essences</hi> in them; he has these Words: <hi>[For, there being ordinarily in each Sort some Leading Qualities, to which we suppose the other, which make up the Complex Idea of that Species, annex'd; we give the Name to that Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Idea which is the most observable, and we take to be the most Distinguishing Idea of that Species.]</hi> Where, if, instead of the Words <hi>[to that Quality,]</hi> be put <hi>[the Subject of that Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,]</hi> to which subject we suppose the rest of its proper Complexion of Accidents <hi>annex'd;</hi> it will be perfectly Co-incident with my Thoughts as to this Point.

Regard to the Matter, did make the <hi>Essence;</hi> whereas, they cannot do this at all, unless by their Determining the Potentiality of the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to be <hi>This,</hi> and as <hi>including</hi> that <hi>Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it; that is, as including the <hi>Matter thus Determin'd.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>L.</hi>'s Definition of <hi>Knowledge</hi> in many respects Faulty.</note> 
                  <hi>of any of our Ideas.</hi> My Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against this Definition are: 1. That <hi>[Perception]</hi> being the Act of a Knowing Power, can mean nothing but <hi>Knowledge;</hi> and, therefore, to define <hi>Knowledge</hi> by <hi>Knowledge</hi> seems Inartificial and Preternatural: For, it will still be ask'd, what this Knowledge he calls <hi>Perception</hi> is? 2. Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> granting Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to <hi>Brutes,</hi> he must necessarily allow them <hi>Ideas,</hi> and that they can <hi>connect</hi> them too. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Book being Entituled, <hi>An Essay concerning Humane Understanding,</hi> it is needful we know <hi>what kind</hi> of Ideas <hi>We</hi> have, what <hi>Brutes</hi> have; and, (not to speak of <hi>our</hi> or <hi>their Perception)</hi> whether <hi>they</hi> do connect them as <hi>we</hi> Men do. For, this Concession makes <hi>Perception</hi> to be the <hi>Genus</hi> in this Definition; and, therefore, to appropriate it to <hi>Humane</hi> Knowledge, the large Signification of it ought to be restrain'd to such a <hi>Perception</hi> as is <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar</hi> to <hi>Man.</hi> But, what I most dislike is the word <hi>[Ideas,]</hi> in our perceiving the Agreement or Disagreement of which he puts Knowledge to consist. Philosophy is the <hi>Knowledge of Things;</hi> wherefore, unless those <hi>Ideas</hi> be the <hi>Thing it self</hi> in our Understanding; or, if they be not, but <hi>Similitudes</hi> only (as the Word imports) unless it be well made out that those <hi>Similitudes</hi> do give us the Knowledge of the <hi>Thing it self,</hi> (which I have demonstrated in my Preliminaries they cannot)

               <p n="3">3.

                  </note> Knowledge, is that which is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify'd by the Word <hi>[Est;]</hi> which being so, in this Proposition, <hi>[Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar is sweet,]</hi> the Word <hi>[Est]</hi> must according to him, if only <hi>Ideas</hi> must be connected, naturally and genuinly affirm, that <hi>one</hi> of those <hi>Ideas</hi> is the other <hi>Idea,</hi> or that the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Sugar</hi> is the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Sweet;</hi> which is evidently False.

Whence follows, that it is not in seeing the Connexion or Disagreement of the <hi>Ideas</hi> themselves that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge can consist; for they are, as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, always <hi>Distinct,</hi> and therefore <hi>Unconnected;</hi> so that we can never say one of them <hi>is</hi> the other, which yet we do in all our Affirmative Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; whence follows, that all our <hi>Affirmative</hi> Propositions would be false. It follows then, that it is the <hi>Subject</hi> or <hi>Thing</hi> inadequately conceiv'd by our Understanding, which is said by the Copula <hi>[Est]</hi> to be Identity'd really and Materially with it self as conceiv'd by another Inadequate Notion;

and, that <hi>[Est]</hi> speaks their being united in the same <hi>Ens,</hi> or ingrafted on the same <hi>Stock of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> And, certainly, it appears, at first Sight, to be an odd Explication of Knowledge and Philosophy, to maintain, that they consist in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Connexion or Disagreement of <hi>Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.</hi>

                  <hi>it, (which has been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly prov'd,)</hi> so <hi>Knowledge</hi> ought to be Defin'd, <hi>The Inadequate Notions of the Thing, existing in the Understanding, so connected there, as they are in the Thing in Nature.</hi> To make good my Definition, I discourse thus: <hi>First,</hi> It has been prov'd by many Arguments, that all our Notions are <hi>Partial Conceptions</hi> of the <hi>Thing;</hi> or, which is the same, (if we take the Word <hi>[Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception]</hi> for the <hi>Object,</hi> and not for the <hi>Act</hi> of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,) they are the <hi>Thing</hi> inadequately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. And, I dare be confident, those Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are unanswerable; and that no true <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> or <hi>Connexion of Terms,</hi> can ever shock them: However, I may expect much Repugnance of <hi>Fancy,</hi> ere that Point be admitted. <hi>Secondly,</hi> All our <hi>Distinct</hi> Notions being <hi>Inadequate,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, (as it were,) <hi>Parts</hi> of the Thing, as 'tis Knowable by us; it follows, that (according to our Doctrine) the Immediate Object of all our Knowledge, being <hi>somewhat</hi> of the Thing, is wholly built on <hi>the Thing it self,</hi> and therefore <hi>Solid. Thirdly,</hi> Those several Notions, however <hi>Inadequate</hi> taking them <hi>Abstractedly,</hi> yet they do connotate the <hi>whole Thing;</hi> since no Part can be
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:95549:182"/>
conceiv'd, but in reference to the <hi>whole,</hi> or as <hi>in it,</hi> it being impossible the <hi>former</hi> can be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended to be a Distinct Thing from the <hi>latter;</hi> because, if it were of it self a <hi>Distinct Thing,</hi> it would be of it self a <hi>Whole,</hi> and not a <hi>Part. Fourthly,</hi> The Copula <hi>[Est]</hi> speaks the <hi>Identity</hi> of those Parts with the <hi>Whole;</hi> for, they can onely be <hi>Identify'd,</hi> as they are <hi>One</hi> with the <hi>whole Thing materially;</hi> since <hi>formally,</hi> as <hi>Parts,</hi> they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinguish'd from one another. And, were it not so, few Propositions (as was lately prov'd) could be True. Whence, let us take any Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, <hi>v. g. [Socrates is wise;]</hi> the true Sense of it is, that the Individual Substance, called <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> is the <hi>same Thing,</hi> Materially, or Really, with that which is <hi>Wise;</hi> or, that, what answers to <hi>Socrates,</hi> and to <hi>Wise,</hi> are found in the same <hi>Thing. Fifthly,</hi> In regard Parts, <hi>as such,</hi> are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd <hi>formally</hi> from one another; therefore, we cannot say that any Partial Notion, express'd formally <hi>as a Part,</hi> is <hi>Another.</hi> Whence we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say <hi>[Petreitas est sapientia,]</hi> tho' we can say <hi>[Petrus est sapiens;]</hi> in regard those Abstract Words do <hi>formally</hi> signifie such a <hi>Partial</hi> Notion of the whole Thing, or a kind of <hi>Part</hi> of it. And, tho' each of them does <hi>connotate</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> Thing, yet, with a <hi>Quatenus,</hi> (to which that <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract</hi> manner of Expression is Equivalent,) they cut off such a precise Considerability, or Notion of it, from <hi>all others;</hi> and therefore, such Words can onely signifie that precise <hi>Notion,</hi> or (as it were) <hi>Part,</hi> and <hi>no other. Lastly,</hi> Hence it is, that we cannot predicate a <hi>Concrete</hi> of an <hi>Abstract,</hi> nor an <hi>Abstract</hi> of a <hi>Concrete;</hi> because the Abstract signifies, distinctly and formally, only a <hi>Part,</hi> and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:95549:182"/>
the <hi>Concrete</hi> the <hi>whole,</hi> (tho' confusedly,) and <hi>not</hi> any <hi>distinct Part</hi> of it. But I expatiate too much into the Subject of Predication, and shall pursue it no farther at present.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To come closer to the Business in hand; It appears by what is here said, that it is not enough for <hi>Knowledge,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Our Definition of <hi>Knowledge</hi> far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maintain'd.</note> nor answers the true Notion of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> that <hi>Ideas</hi> be <hi>predicated</hi> of other <hi>Ideas,</hi> or <hi>Similitudes</hi> of <hi>Similitudes;</hi> nor (which is the same) that we see they <hi>agree</hi> or <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree</hi> with <hi>one another;</hi> but it is necessary, that the Ground of our Knowledge, and of our Predicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be taken from the <hi>Thing it self,</hi> as is express'd in <hi>our</hi> Definition. I produce not here the Definition of <hi>Knowing</hi> which I gave in my Preliminaries, because it is not yet granted by those with whom I am discoursing, that our <hi>Notions</hi> are the <hi>Things</hi> in our Understanding; tho' (one Consideration, which is brought there, being added) these two Definitions are Co-incident: But I accommodate my self to Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Words, as far as they will bear, that the Difference between us may be made more apparent.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence, whereas Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> makes <hi>Four</hi> Sorts of Connexions of our <hi>Ideas,</hi> in which Knowledge is found, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Of <note place="margin">Hence, there is but <hi>One</hi> Sort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, in which Knowledge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists: <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Co-existence.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Identity,</hi> or <hi>Diversity:</hi> 2. Of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:</hi> 3. <hi>Co-existence:</hi> 4. <hi>Real Existence;</hi> I must, in pursuance to the Grounds now laid, affirm, and maintain, that there is but <hi>one</hi> Sort of Intellectual Connexion of our Notions, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Co-existence</hi> of what is meant by the two Terms in the <hi>same Thing;</hi> and, that (there
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:95549:183"/>
being but <hi>one</hi> Copula <hi>[Est,]</hi> all the other Sorts of Connexion are co-incident with this one. For, the First consisting in this, that each <hi>Idea,</hi> or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>is its Self,</hi> and <hi>not Another,</hi> signifies no more but what we express by this Identical Proposition, <hi>[The Thing as thus conceiv'd, is the Thing as thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd;</hi> or, <hi>not as otherwise conceiv'd.]</hi> Whence it is <hi>Self-evident,</hi> because the Terms being every way the self-same Notion, are as closely connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as perfect Identity can express them; whence they can admit no Middle Term to come between them, and <hi>make</hi> the Proposition Evident, or <hi>prove</hi> it: But their Evidence is entirely grounded on this first Metaphysical Principle, <hi>[Every Thing</hi> (whether Substance or Accident) <hi>is what it is;</hi> or, is <hi>Indivisum in se,</hi> and <hi>Divisum a quolibet alio;]</hi> that is, in plain terms, <hi>One.</hi> The <hi>Second, [Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;]</hi> taking it not for the <hi>Act</hi> of our Mind, comparing or connecting it to another; but for the Ground of it in the Thing, which obliges our Comparing Power, when it is in it, to refer it <hi>actually;</hi> is still the <hi>Thing</hi> it self, inadequately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd to be Connected with, or agreeing to the same Thing <hi>in part,</hi> as is explicated above. <hi>V. g. Master</hi> and <hi>Scholar</hi> are grounded on the Actions and Passions of <hi>Teaching,</hi> and <hi>being Taught,</hi> which are Inadequate Conceptions, Co-existing in those two Persons, and Identify'd materially with those Subjects: And the same is found in all others, which are <hi>thus Connected.</hi> And <hi>the Last,</hi> Of <hi>Real Existence;</hi> As, when we say, <hi>[Peter is,]</hi> clearly imports, that what is meant by <hi>Peter,</hi> the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and by <hi>Existent,</hi> which is the Predicate, (imply'd there in the Word <hi>[is,])</hi> are <hi>Co-existent;</hi> or, are found in the same <hi>Thing.</hi> But, more of

               </p>
               <p n="7">7. His Second Chapter, <hi>Of the Degrees of our Knowledge,</hi> distinguishing it into <hi>Intuitive, Demonstrative,</hi> and <hi>Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Degrees of our Knowledge assign'd by Mr. <hi>L.</hi> very Solid.</note> is admirably Solid, Clear, and Rational throughout. The First of these is proper to <hi>Principles,</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to <hi>Proofs,</hi> the Last to the Knowledge of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Things or Modes by the way of <hi>Experiments.</hi> Indeed, <hi>Intuitive</hi> Knowledge is proper to <hi>Pure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> call'd Intelligences or <hi>Angels;</hi> which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do not <hi>glean</hi> their Knowledge from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Impressions on the Senses, consequently they do not <hi>divide</hi> the thing into <hi>Parts,</hi> by Inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Notions, when they come to know it; nor <hi>compound</hi> those Notions again into Propositions, as <hi>we</hi> do; but, at one <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>full</hi> View, call'd <hi>Intuition,</hi> they comprehend the whole Thing, and all that belongs to it, <hi>at once.</hi> Whence it seems not so proper to attribute <hi>Intuition</hi> to us Mortals, who are but poor Retailers of our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and short Notions; which we <hi>spell</hi> (as it were) and put together as Children do Letters, when they are, otherwise, not able to <hi>read</hi> whole Words currently. But this is very pardonable in Mr. <hi>Locke;</hi> for, to say true, 'tis very hard to find another Word which fits our Knowledge of First Principles much better; tho' I think <hi>[Self-evidence]</hi> might serve. My self have long ago had such a Thought, tho' I express'd it warily in these words: "There is nothing in all our Knowledges, that, in the manner of it, comes so near the <hi>Angelical Intuition</hi> as does our Knowledge of Self-evident Principles, express'd by <hi>Identical Propositions.</hi>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:95549:184"/>
It <hi>divides</hi> as little as is possible for us in this State; for it predicates the same of the same; nay, the <hi>whole</hi> of the <hi>whole;</hi> and, for the same Reason, it as little <hi>compounds</hi> again. Whence, it resembles it not a little in its <hi>Absolute Evidence</hi> and <hi>Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable Firmness;</hi> and is the nearest Approach pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to Simple Intuition. That so, as the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the World requires, the <hi>Supremum infimi</hi> may immediately confine upon the <hi>Infimum Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premi."</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. I was much pleased to see Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> declare, that <hi>upon this Intuition depends all the Certainty and Evidence we have</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Every Step we take in Demonstrative Knowledge, or eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Consequence,</hi> must be grounded on <hi>Self-evidence</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>of our Knowledge, and particularly, that, in every Step Reason makes in Demonstrative Knowledge,</hi> (that is, in every <hi>Consequence</hi> we deduce) <hi>there is an Intuitive Knowledge of the Agreement or Disagreement of the next intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Idea.</hi> I add, <hi>Upon which Agreement all the Force of Consequenee, that is, all our Reasonings are grounded.</hi> The Evident Proof he gives for it here, is worthy the attentive Consideration of his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Readers. 'Tis not in this occasion only, but in divers others, tho' I have not always noted them, that Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> and my self have, without design'd Confederacy, agreed in Positions of great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which, I know not how, have escap'd the Thoughts of all other Authors I have seen. The Reader may please to review my <hi>Method to Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, B.</hi> 3. <hi>Less.</hi> 1. §. 3. where I discourse thus: "Wherefore, since, if the <hi>Consequence,</hi> in which consists the Essence, and all the Force and Nerves of Discourse, be not Clear and Evident, there could be no Certainty or Evidence of any thing
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:95549:184"/>
that needs to be <hi>made known</hi> or <hi>Concluded;</hi> and so our Faculty of Exact Reasoning would have been given us to no purpose; hence, 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that however one <hi>Proposition</hi> may be <hi>made known</hi> by other <hi>Propositions</hi> that are connected and <hi>consequential</hi> to one <hi>another; yet the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> it self <hi>cannot be proved by Another Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</hi> For, the Question would still return <hi>how,</hi> and in virtue of <hi>what,</hi> that <hi>Consequence</hi> which made the <hi>other</hi> Evident, is Evident <hi>it self,</hi> and so <hi>in infinitum.</hi> Whence it follows, that the <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>all</hi> Consequences whatever, must be built on something in a higher manner Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than any <hi>Consequence</hi> or <hi>Proof</hi> can <hi>otherwise</hi> make it; that is, on a Self-evident Proposition.]" The certain Knowledge of which kind of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, as Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> holds, is to be had by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition.</hi>

               <p n="9">9. I have been larger upon this Point, and do most especially recommend it to the best Reflexion of our Readers; <note place="margin">The great Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this last Position.</note> because it is not only the Deepest and Firmest Ground, but also the very <hi>best</hi> Test of all Argumentation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the main Hinge on which all <hi>Science</hi> turns. I must confess, for all that, I cannot see why, since all Self-evident Truths can only be express'd by <hi>Identical Propositions,</hi> this Learned Gentleman is so shy to use those <hi>Words,</hi> since the <hi>Sense</hi> he brings on this Occasion, is clearly Equivalent to those <hi>Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Forms of Speech; nor, if put into Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, can be express'd by any other. I think we should not be asham'd of them, or think them <hi>Trifling,</hi> because some Men of Fancy, who never set their Thoughts to trace Evidence and Truth to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:95549:185"/>
their Originals, are pleased to make themselves Sport with them; nor because their Terms are too closely connected; For, they <hi>must</hi> be so; and, were they <hi>not</hi> so, they would be unworthy the Name of <hi>First Principles,</hi> nor do us <hi>any Good</hi> when we come to <hi>reduce</hi> other Truths into them; which is the best Way of <hi>Demonstrating.</hi>

And, besides, they have the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of cutting Capers beyond the Moon, and raising Objections at <hi>random.</hi> The Latter does, perhaps, as much Harm, by <hi>Presuming</hi> to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate <hi>every Thing:</hi> And the Over-weening of <hi>these</hi> Men is the more pernicious, because they make a Shew of a great Friendship and Zeal for <hi>Science;</hi> and yet, by falling short of their Extravagant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions, they throw a Scandal upon her; and make weak Distinguishers apprehend there is <hi>no</hi>

                  <hi>Science at all.</hi> The One deviates from Zeal for Truth, in Excess; the Other, in Defect: And the Judicious Decision of this Point, [Of <hi>the Extent of our Knowledge,]</hi> settles the <hi>Golden Mean</hi> between both. I have endeavour'd, in my <hi>Method, B.</hi> 1. <hi>Less.</hi> 2. to §. 12. to establish from Clear Grounds, the <hi>Just Pitch</hi> of our Knowledge <hi>in this State:</hi> Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> does, with his usual Candour, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to do the same in <hi>his</hi> Way; Concerning which, I am to give him my Thoughts; which are these.</p>
               <p n="11">11. There is no doubt but we have less Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge than we might have had, through our Want of some No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <note place="margin">We have Sensitive Knowledge of other Notions, besides <hi>Existence.</hi>
                  </note> as also, for want of discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Agreement or Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them in the <hi>same Thing.</hi> No doubt too, but Intuitive Knowledge, which is only of <hi>Self-evident</hi> Truths, cannot reach to <hi>all</hi> that <hi>belongs</hi> to our Notions, or <hi>Ideas;</hi> and, that we too often want proper <hi>Mediums</hi> to connect those Notions, in order to Demonstration: As also, that our Sensitive Knowledge (I suppose he means that which is had by <hi>Experiments)</hi> does not reach very far; otherwise, our Senses giving us (as we do both of us hold) all the First <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Notions</hi> we have, I believe it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, but that they give us withall the <hi>Ground</hi> of <hi>all</hi> our Knowledge. Whence I cannot see, why he limits <hi>Sensitive</hi> Knowledge to the Notion of <hi>Existence</hi> onely; or, that our Senses do make us know onely that a Thing <hi>is:</hi> For, certainly, our Senses do as well tell us the <hi>Wall is white,</hi> as that the <hi>Wall is;</hi> tho', in proper Speech, it does <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> but by means of our <hi>Mind,</hi> comparing the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:95549:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Notions of the two Terms, given us by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, in order to the seeing their <hi>Co-existence in the Thing.</hi> All they do, is, to give us our <hi>Notions;</hi> which the Soul (that is, the <hi>Man,</hi> according to his <hi>Spiritual</hi> Part) compounds into a Proposition; and so frames a Judgment of the said Co-existence (or Inconsistency) of those Terms, or (which is the same) of what is signify'd by them, in the same Thing. Nor do I think Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> will much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny any of this, however we may express our selves diversly.</p>
               <p n="12">12. 'Tis very true that our Experience gives us some Light to know what Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties do belong to such Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; <note place="margin">Onely <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and not <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,</hi> can give us any Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Natural Qualities.</note> yet, I cannot think it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to know this <hi>very often a priori,</hi> by <hi>Demonstrative Reason,</hi> tho' we do not know <hi>the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Minute Parts,</hi> on which those Qualities do depend; much less do I judge, that, <hi>tho' we did not know them,</hi> yet we could <hi>not discover any necessary Connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and any of the Secondary Qualities;</hi> he means, those Qualities which are the <hi>Objects of our Senses.</hi> Nor do I wonder Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> thinks thus, because he does, all along, pitch his Thoughts on the <hi>Corpuscularian Hypothesis,</hi> as on that which, in some Men's Opinion, <hi>goes farthest in an Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Explication of the Qualities of Body.</hi> Now, my Judgment is, that 'tis demonstrable, that the Principles of the <hi>Corpuscularians</hi> cannot possibly give Account of <hi>the Constitution</hi> either of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Parts,</hi> or of the least Atom, nor, consequently, of any Body in Nature; or (which is the Proper Work of a Philosopher) <hi>refund</hi> any Quality <hi>into</hi>

I have shewn in my <hi>Appendix</hi> to my <hi>Method,</hi> that the most Celebrated of the <hi>Corpuscularian</hi> Philosophers, the <hi>Cartesians,</hi> cannot <hi>know the Constitution</hi> of the <hi>most minute Part</hi> of any of their <hi>Elements,</hi> since they can never tell us by <hi>their</hi> Grounds, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Qualities of their <hi>First Matter,</hi> of which their three Elements, and, consequently, all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Bodies are made. To shew <hi>we</hi> can, I will give a short Summary of the <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in this particular, truly represented, and cleared from the Mis-conceits of some late School-men.</p>
               <p n="13">13. 'Tis confess'd, and Evident, that <hi>Quantity</hi> is the Primary Affection of Body; of which, re-modify'd, (as I <note place="margin">Short Hints of the true <hi>Aristotelian</hi> Grounds.</note> may say,) all Qualities are made. We can shew, that <hi>by it</hi> Body is <hi>Divisible;</hi> and, therefore, <hi>Quantity</hi> (for that, and and many other Reasons) is <hi>Divisibility,</hi> especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, taking it as consider'd <hi>Physically:</hi> however, taking it as capable to be Measur'd, Proportion'd, and Figur'd, (as Mathematicians do,) it may not very unfitly be called <hi>Extension.</hi> But, take it, (as I said,) as affecting Bodies, in order to <hi>Natural Action</hi> and <hi>Passion,</hi> in which the Course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture consists, (as a Natural Philosopher ought to consider it,) and 'tis <hi>Divisibility,</hi> or a Capacity to be divided by those Causes. Nor can the Greatest <hi>Cartesian</hi> deny this, since he grants, that the <hi>First</hi> Operation in Nature, is, the making their three Elements, by <hi>Grinding</hi> (as it were) or

                  <hi>dividing</hi> their First Matter.

in the <hi>Corpuscularian Hypothesis;</hi> which puts all Parts of their Matter to be <hi>equally</hi> Rare, or Dense; or rather, (as the <hi>Cartesians</hi> do,) <hi>neither</hi> Rare, <hi>nor</hi> Dense; all Qualities, according to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made by mingling their three Elements; which Elements are themselves made by, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose, the Motion of their First Matter.

That great <hi>Pellucidity</hi> in the Air is necessarily, and properly refunded into its extream Divisibility, or <hi>Rarity;</hi> by which it becomes easily penetrable in all its Parts, by those <hi>Spicula Ignea,</hi> the Rays of the Sun; and <hi>Opacity,</hi> for the same Reason, is the Proper Effect of <hi>Density;</hi> which hinders
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:95549:188" rendition="simple:additions"/>
its Subject from being penetrated, or <hi>Divided</hi> by them; whence also it is a Proper Cause of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling, or Reflecting them. Again; Who <hi>sees</hi> not that <hi>Liquidity,</hi> which makes its Subject easily yielding to be flatted evenly, as we see in Ponds; or driven to run into Cavities, by the common Motion of Gravitation, is a proper Effect of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as <hi>Consistency</hi> is of Density? Spissitude is a Constipation of Dense Parts, or the Want of Pores to admit the Ingress of other Bodies. <hi>Gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situde</hi> is clearly nothing but Density, in a <hi>bigger</hi> Quantity of its Parts. <hi>Friability</hi> is refunded into great Dense Parts, and very large Rare ones: Whence, those Rare Parts, which, were they less, would better cement those Parts together, being now very large, and, withal, very Divisible, are <hi>easily divided;</hi> and, consequently, the Body is soon shatter'd: As we find in Dry Clods, out of which, (while they were yet <hi>Wet Dirt,)</hi> those Parts which were Watry, being drawn by Heat, large Cavities are left, which the Air now possesses. On the other side, <hi>Ductility</hi> and <hi>Malleability</hi> are the Effects of the very smallest Rare Parts, fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compacted with the minutest <hi>Dense</hi> ones. Those <hi>Small</hi> Dense Parts, so closely woven, and, in a manner, Contiguous, keep the Rare from evaporating; and the <hi>Rare,</hi> by being such, and interwoven with the Dense all over, make the Compound yield to Expansion, without Breaking; being <hi>very small,</hi> are not easily separable; and yet, tho' rarify'd farther by the subtilest Agent, Fire, they render it <hi>Fusible.</hi>

the Grounds of Nature in <hi>Euclides Physicus</hi> (where they will find Demonstrations enow) to farther Conclusions, with the same Zeal as they do the Mathematicks; I doubt not but the Evident Truths, which would by Degrees disclose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, would both encourage, and enable them, to make a farther Progress in Knowledge; nor would the Science of <hi>Second</hi> Qualities, (about which Physical Demonstrations ought in great part be employ'd) be held so Desperate. But to leave these Discourses, and apply my self to Mr. <hi>L.</hi> I cannot but wonder, that amongst all his <hi>Ideas</hi> of Qualities, he not so much as once mentions (as far as I remember) those two <hi>Chiefest</hi> ones of <hi>Rarity</hi> and <hi>Density;</hi> tho' nothing is more obvious in the whole Course of Nature than these are. Which, with many other Reasons, makes me think he had not seen, or at least well weigh'd the true <hi>Aristotelian</hi> System, (which he might have seen in Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby's Treatise of Bodies,</hi> and its Latin Preface; as also in <hi>Institutiones Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticae;)</hi> but took it as represented by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Schools.

Which, I believe, no other Sect of Philosophers did ever so much as pretend to.</p>

18. To come to those Qualities, which are the Formal Object of our Senses, called by Mr. <hi>Locke Secondary</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Possibility of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating them shewn by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Colour.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Qualities,</hi> I have shewn already that divers of them are <hi>Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and Explicable by <hi>Rarity</hi> and <hi>Density;</hi> only certain little Respects are added to them, which too lie in our Ken: Nor do I doubt but most of the others may be clearly and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known by the same Grounds. Indeed, divers of them depend on the <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Texture</hi> of Parts; which, tho' we can never know with a Mathematical Exactness, yet I see not why we may not demonstrate the <hi>Natures</hi> or <hi>Kinds</hi> of each Quality, so far as to <hi>distinguish</hi> them from <hi>others,</hi> and refund them into their <hi>Proper Causes;</hi> which is enough for our purpose, and most proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to our State. For Example, <hi>Light</hi> brings from the Wall into the Eye, and so into our Knowing Power, the Notion of <hi>Whiteness,</hi> and of other Colours from other Objects. It cannot be doubted then, (since Light of its self is <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form)</hi> but that there is some Disposition in the Surface of the Object, or the Figure of its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Parts, which reflects Light after a different manner, and affects the Seer accordingly. Nor is it hard to conceive, but very Evident, that a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry smooth Surface, as having <hi>fewest Pores</hi> in it, will reflect <hi>more</hi> Light, and so make it <hi>more Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> especially if those Outmost Parts be <hi>Roundish,</hi> which reflect Light every way, or towards all sides. It is manifest then that, that Quality which is <hi>most Visible</hi> of all others being that which we call <hi>Whiteness,</hi> the Proper Causes of that Quality may be found out. Which will further appear
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:95549:190"/>
hence, that if, on the contrary, the Surface have Small-pointed Parts and Large Pores, much of the Light will be lost in those shady Grotts, and scarce any Beam of it reflected; which therefore is the Proper Cause of that Lightless Appearance call'd <hi>Blackness;</hi> which is the Reason why, when there is no Light at all to be reflected, all things seem Black. If we hold a Thousand Needles Points to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Eye, they appear Black, because of the vastness of the Interstices or Cavities in proportion to the extant Parts which should have reflected the Light: Whereas, were the Object a polish'd Plate of Steel, the Interstices or Pores being less, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears more luminous and whitish; which may give us some faint, but sure, Light, how this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is made. The Intermediate Colours are made by the Mixture and Demixture of those Extreams; whence, out of the Degrees of their partaking those, Contrary or Subcontrary Qualities are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as Blue, Green, Yellow, and all other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. Nor is this <hi>Degree,</hi> constituting each of those <hi>Species,</hi> Unknowable. A Picture-drawer can tell us what Proportion of his Paint of <hi>such</hi> a Colour he adds to that of <hi>another</hi> Colour, to make what <hi>Third</hi> Colour he pleases. We see then, that the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary Quality</hi> of <hi>Colour,</hi> may come within the Compass of our Knowledge. Nor do I see why the <hi>rest</hi> of them may not become <hi>equally</hi> Intelligible, did we seriously set our Reflex Thoughts on work to study them; especially Experimental Knowledge assisting, by hinting to us such Matters of Fact as give Light to our Reason, (when furnish'd with, and attentive to, true Natural Principles) how it may <hi>reduce</hi> those Qualities unto their <hi>Proper Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> which is the <hi>only</hi> Work of <hi>Science.</hi>

I Come now to a nearer view of the <hi>4th</hi> Chapter, <hi>Of the Reality of Knowledge,</hi> the main point in which the whole Doctrine of the <hi>Ideists</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. <note place="margin">The State of the Question.</note> To State it rightly, I do not doubt (as I have exprest my self formerly) but that the <hi>Ideists</hi> have many true Notions of the <hi>Things;</hi> that is, the Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their Minds, after a Natural Manner, as well as their Opposers have, notwithstanding their ill Speculation; and thence oftentimes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course right; for the same Reason that, tho' some Philosophers held that the Eye sees <hi>per Emissionem,</hi> others <hi>per Receptionem Radiorum,</hi> yet they naturally saw <hi>both a like,</hi> however their Speculative thoughts, disfer'd about the <hi>manner</hi> how <hi>Seeing</hi> was made. Wherefore the true State of the Question is, whether they can have any <hi>Real Knowledge</hi> of the things in Nature, <hi>according to the Principles of the Ideists;</hi> or, by their puting our Notions, which are the Ground and Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of our Knowledge, to be onely <hi>Likenesses, Appearances, Similitudes, Resemblances, Pourtraitures,</hi> or <hi>Pictures</hi> of the Things, (which are the names they give them) and not the <hi>Things themselves</hi> in our minds: For, if they can have <hi>no Real Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> or <hi>Knowledge of the Thing,</hi> by such <hi>meerly</hi>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:95549:191"/>
                  <hi>representing Ideas,</hi> then it must be said that those <hi>Ideas,</hi> being confessedly the <hi>First</hi> and <hi>onely</hi> Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of their Knowledge, the <hi>Ideists</hi> will become oftentimes liable to deviate from Nature, and fall into Errour by adhering to such Groundless Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as is the Substituting very often <hi>Empty Resemblances,</hi> or <hi>Fancies,</hi> for the <hi>Things themselves;</hi> nor can they ever be able to give a Solid Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count by <hi>their</hi> Principles, that they know <hi>any thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Now, it seems to me (tho' I should wave those many pregnant Arguments brought against them, in my <note place="margin">How we know the <hi>Things</hi> by means of <hi>Ideas,</hi> Inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.</note> three first Preliminaries) that the very Position of the <hi>Ideists,</hi> does decide the Question, and confute themselves. For, if we may trust their words, they agree that we know the <hi>Things</hi> as well as the <hi>Ideas,</hi> and onely differ in the manner <hi>how:</hi> Of which Mr. <hi>L.</hi> tell us here § 3. <hi>'Tis Evident the mind knows not Things immediately, but onely by the Intervention of the Ideas it has of them.</hi> Whence I much fear that by <hi>Ideas</hi> he means <hi>Phantasms,</hi> or Material Pictures in the <hi>Imagination;</hi> by <hi>whose</hi> Intervention 'tis indeed confest we know. For, otherwise, it is far from <hi>Evident,</hi> that we know them by <hi>means</hi> of those <hi>Spiritual</hi> Conceptions, we call <hi>Notions;</hi> since we bring many close Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, fetcht from the Nature of the Thing, to prove that there is perfect Evidence of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:</hi> For, those <hi>Ideas</hi> or Notions being held and shown by us, to be the Things in our Mind, their very <hi>being there,</hi> or in a <hi>Knowing Power,</hi> is to be <hi>known:</hi> Nor can they be held by us to be the <hi>means</hi> to know <hi>themselves;</hi> for, so the same
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:95549:192"/>
would be the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>End</hi> both, which is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. But, let us consider his words. <hi>The mind,</hi> he says, <hi>knows the Things by the Interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ideas.</hi> The Question then is what the <hi>Idea</hi> does, and what the word <hi>[Intervention]</hi> means. Does the Mind see the Thing <hi>without,</hi> by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>out</hi> her Rayes of Knowledge to <hi>it?</hi> This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said, in regard all the Acts of Knowledge which the Mind has, are <hi>Immanent</hi> ones, and are <hi>receiv'd</hi> in that which <hi>produced</hi> them, as in their <hi>onely</hi> Subject. Does then the Thing that is <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi> send its beams by the <hi>Ideas,</hi> as by a kind of Spiritual Optick-glass, to which the mind lays her Intellectual Eye? Neither can this be said, for the Mind could see or know the Thing <hi>it self</hi> were it <hi>in it,</hi> else how could it know the <hi>Ideas?</hi> Rather, were the Thing in the Understanding, it could not but be <hi>known,</hi> whether there were any Similitude, besides, in it, or no. It may be said that the Mind knows the Thing by the <hi>Idea</hi> because it is a Picture or Similitude that represents it. But I way walk in a Gallery, and see a Hundred Pictures in it of Men, and many other Things in Nature; and yet not know one jot the better, any one of the Things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, unless I had know them formerly, tho' <hi>Apelles</hi> himself had drawn them. I may <hi>remember</hi> them <hi>again,</hi> indeed, if I had known them <hi>before;</hi> which cannot be said in our case, because those <hi>Ideas</hi> of theirs are to give them the <hi>First</hi> Knowledge of the Thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Being thus at a loss to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate <hi>[Intervention]</hi> or to know <note place="margin">The Ideists must be forced to grant that the <hi>Thing</hi> known is <hi>in</hi> the Mind.</note> what It, or the <hi>Idea</hi> or Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion serves for, we will reflect
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:95549:192"/>
next upon the Word <hi>[know]</hi> which Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> applies (tho' not so <hi>immediately,</hi> yet) <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,</hi> to the <hi>Thing</hi> and to the <hi>Idea.</hi> Now, if this be so, and that to <hi>to be known</hi> agrees to them both; then, as the <hi>Idea</hi> is in the Mind when it is <hi>known,</hi> so the <hi>Thing,</hi> when <hi>known,</hi> should be <hi>in</hi> the Mind too, which is our very Position, thought by the <hi>Ideists</hi> so Paradoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and yet here forcibly admitted by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. And, if neither the <hi>Idea</hi> brings the Thing <hi>into</hi> the Knowing Power, or (which is the same) into the <hi>Mind;</hi> nor the Mind, or Knowing Power goes <hi>out of</hi> the Soul <hi>to it,</hi> I know not how they can pretend to show how the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power,</hi> and the Thing <hi>known,</hi> can ever come to <hi>meet,</hi> as they must when ever an <hi>Act of Knowledge</hi> is made. 'Tis to no purpose then, to alledge that the Thing <hi>comes into</hi> the mind, or is <hi>brought thither</hi> by means of the <hi>Idea;</hi> for, if it <hi>comes</hi> or is <hi>brought thither,</hi> let it be by what <hi>means</hi> it will, 'tis most incontestably Evident that, <hi>after</hi> it is come or brought <hi>thither,</hi> it is <hi>there.</hi> Nor can all the Wit of Man avoid this Consequence, unless plain words must lose their Signification. Wherefore Mr. <hi>L.</hi> in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance of his own Principles should not have said <hi>that the Mind does not know Things imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, but by means of the Ideas;</hi> but, that it does not know them at <hi>all,</hi> neither <hi>mediately</hi> nor <hi>immediately;</hi> for if the Thing be <hi>in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> at all, they must be <hi>in the Mind,</hi> where <hi>onely</hi> the <hi>Knowledge is;</hi> which comes over (thus far) to our Position.</p>

To demonstrate which, I argue thus: Ere he can know that the <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation</hi> and the <hi>Thing represented</hi> do agree, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sense tells us, he must have <hi>both</hi> the <hi>Idea</hi> and the <hi>Thing in</hi> his <hi>Comparing Power,</hi> that is, in his Mind; that so he may take a View of <hi>both</hi> of them, and consider them <hi>in order to one another;</hi> and, by doing this, <hi>see</hi> whether the one does <hi>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resemble</hi> the other, or no. But, this is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the Principles of the <hi>Ideists,</hi> who do not allow that the <hi>Thing</hi> can be <hi>in</hi> the Mind, but the <hi>Idea</hi> only. Next, he alledges, that his <hi>Complex Ideas</hi> are <hi>Archetypes;</hi> and <hi>not Conformable to the Things,</hi> as the others were, but <hi>to themselves</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and, therefore, he says, they cannot lead us into Errour, because they <hi>cannot but represent themselves.</hi> I pass by the Oddness of the Position,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:95549:193"/>
that the <hi>Idea,</hi> which is a <hi>Picture,</hi> should be a <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of it self,</hi> or <hi>represent it self:</hi> I only note, that this Allegation which should <hi>clear</hi> the Point, quite <hi>loses</hi> it, and <hi>gives it up.</hi> For, the Question is, whether his <hi>Ideas</hi> do give us the Knowledge of the Things in Nature; and 'tis evident, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd they cannot give us this Knowledge of them, but by <hi>representing</hi> them: Now, he tells us, that his <hi>Complex Ideas are not Copies of the Things,</hi> nor <hi>represent them,</hi> but <hi>themselves only.</hi> Whence is evidently concluded, that we are never the nearer to the Knowing of <hi>Things</hi> by <hi>them;</hi> no, not obliquely, and <hi>at Second hand,</hi> or by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention</hi> of those <hi>Ideas,</hi> or Similitudes represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, as was pretended formerly. Whence, for any thing he has produced, we may justly doubt whether such <hi>Ideas</hi> are not <hi>Whimsical Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> without <hi>any Reality at all;</hi> since he will not allow them even that <hi>slightest</hi> Relation to the <hi>Things,</hi> of so much as <hi>representing</hi> them. But, which is much worse, he affirms, §. 5. that <hi>those Ideas themselves are consider'd as the Archetypes; and the Things no otherwise regarded, but as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to them.</hi> Now, this seems to me a strange way of proving the <hi>Reality of our Knowledge,</hi> by <hi>Ideas,</hi> to affirm, that we are not to <hi>regard the Things,</hi> but as <hi>conformable to our Ideas.</hi> Is not this to make Philosophy not the <hi>Knowledge of Things,</hi> but of <hi>Ideas</hi> only; and to pretend, that the <hi>Thing</hi> must only be held <hi>True,</hi> if it be Conformable to our <hi>Ideas?</hi> He might as well have said <hi>Fancies;</hi> for, he expresly says, these Complex <hi>Ideas</hi> are <hi>made by the Mind,</hi> and <hi>not taken from</hi> the Thing, nor <hi>like</hi> it: And, whatever is neither the <hi>Res,</hi> nor so much as <hi>like</hi> it, can neither have <hi>Reality,</hi> nor
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:95549:194"/>
                  <hi>Shew</hi> of Reality; and therefore, must be a <hi>meer Fancy.</hi> Now, these <hi>Complex</hi> Ideas reach much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than all the <hi>others</hi> do; <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Modes, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> and <hi>Relations;</hi> as is seen, <hi>Book</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. So that this Discourse of his destroys <hi>the Reality of our Knowledge</hi> in <hi>almost all</hi> the Things we are to know. He will, perhaps, say, those Complex Ideas are the <hi>Effects</hi> of certain <hi>Powers</hi> to Cause them, found in the Thing; and, by this Means they bring the Things, as being their <hi>Causes, into their Mind.</hi> But the Argument returns still with the same Force; for, if they bring the Thing <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> the Mind, then the Thing is <hi>in</hi> the Mind when it is <hi>brought thither.</hi> Add, that this makes them <hi>Resemblances</hi> of the Thing, which he denies; for, the <hi>Effect,</hi> being a <hi>Participation of the Cause,</hi> must necessarily <hi>resemble it;</hi> especially, if it be a Natural Effect. Nor can he say they make us know the Thing, because they are made up of <hi>Simple</hi> ones: For, as the Simple Ideas only made us know the Thing by <hi>representing</hi> it, so these other not <hi>representing It,</hi> have lost the Power of making us know it at all. So that, let them turn which way they will, either the Thing is <hi>never</hi> brought <hi>into</hi> the Knowledge, or the Mind; and then it can never <hi>be known:</hi> Or, <hi>it is</hi> brought <hi>thither,</hi> and then it must be <hi>there;</hi> which is our Position, and deny'd by the <hi>Ideists.</hi>

And, were such an Objection made, or had it any force, he might also reply, that in every part of his Discourse, he <hi>does</hi> regard Existence, and cannot do otherwise; unless any Objecter should be so weak as to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that <hi>what exists in the Mind, does not exist at all.</hi> For, if he had once his Notions from the <hi>Thing,</hi> they would be still the <hi>Thing in the Mind,</hi> and <hi>Real,</hi> tho' the Individual Objects, whence they were taken, be perish'd. Nay, more; <hi>those Things</hi> would have a Better, a more Durable, and more Noble Existence <hi>in the Mind,</hi> than they had in Nature. I say, <hi>[those Things;]</hi> not fearing that any should object, that <hi>Thing</hi> signifies the <hi>whole;</hi> which may seem contrary to my former Doctrine, that the Thing is only in the Mind by <hi>Inadequate</hi> Notions, or <hi>in part.</hi> For, tho' the

                  <hi>Formal</hi> Conception be onely of some <hi>Quality</hi> of it, <hi>expresly</hi> and <hi>distinctly,</hi> yet it <hi>implies</hi> or <hi>conno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates</hi> the Knowledge of the <hi>whole</hi> Thing <hi>confused<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> it being most clearly demonstrable in Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicks, that <hi>there are no Actual Parts in any Compound whatever:</hi> So that 'tis still the <hi>whole Thing</hi> that is known, tho' onely a Part (as it were) of it be known <hi>distinctly.</hi> Upon this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Principle, that <hi>there are no Actual Parts,</hi> is grounded that Solid and most approved Maxim, that <hi>Actions and Passions are of the Suppositum,</hi> or Individual Thing. Thus, when the <hi>Hand</hi> strikes or wounds a Man, 'tis truly said, that the <hi>Man</hi> (which signifies the <hi>whole Thing)</hi> did it, and is answerable for it; and, if he kills the Person he struck, the <hi>whole Man</hi> will <hi>be hang'd</hi> for it, tho' the Hand onely, and not the Legs, Head, Neck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> gave the Blow. Now, this could neither be said with Truth, nor that Punishment be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by Justice, if the Word <hi>[Hand]</hi> did not <hi>signifie,</hi> and truly <hi>were</hi> the <hi>whole Man, according to</hi> his Faculty of <hi>Handling</hi> or <hi>Striking,</hi> or accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>that Part</hi> which immediately did that Action. The self-same is to be said, and for the self-same Reason, of our <hi>Inadequate</hi> Notions; and, that each of them implies, or connotates (that is, materially and entitatively <hi>is)</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> Thing, tho' <hi>formally</hi> or <hi>precisely</hi> but a <hi>Part</hi> of it, as it were; or the Thing <hi>according to such a particular</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderability, found in it, or Identify'd with it. Whoever shall weigh attentively the Force and Coherence of this Discourse, will clearly discern how <hi>entirely</hi> all <hi>our Philosophy is built on the Things,</hi> and is the <hi>Knowledge of them;</hi> and how far the <hi>Ideists</hi> fall short of having that Solid Ground for

the <hi>Basis</hi> of their Discourses: But, especially, this Tenet, which puts their <hi>Complex Ideas</hi> not onely <hi>not to be the Thing,</hi> (which it must be some Way, or to some degree or other, if it be not a meer <hi>Fancy,)</hi> but, not to be so much as a <hi>Copy</hi> or <hi>Resemblance</hi> of it, which (as was said) is the slightest and least Relation it can possibly have to it.</p>

8. It is very hard, when two Writers go upon different Principles, not to mistake now and then one the others <note place="margin">In what manner we compound such No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> Meaning; and I would be loath to wrong so Ingenuous an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. Sometimes he seems to mean no more by his <hi>Complex Ideas,</hi> but either those Compound No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are made up of the Simpler Notions of the <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Difference,</hi> as we descend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the <hi>same</hi> Line; or else, of those in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Lines; and, I am sure, let him discourse them as he will, they can be compounded of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else; those Common Heads comprizing all the Natural Notions we can have. It is no less certain too, that we can put together (as he says) Simple Notions as we please, which we have not observ'd thus put together in things that actually exist. But then we must be wary, while we do this, that our <hi>Reason</hi> joins them by seeing them <hi>Consistent</hi> and <hi>Compossible:</hi> For, our <hi>Fancy</hi> will put together <hi>Ideas</hi> which are utterly <hi>Repugnant</hi> to one another, and are altogether Chimerical. Now, if the Notions, thus join'd by us, be Consistent, the Nature or Thing suppos'd to be the Ground of those Notions is <hi>possible to be;</hi> which being the Notion of <hi>Ens,</hi> hence they are conceiv'd as a kind of <hi>Intellectual Entity,</hi> created (as it were) by the Mind, and thence have an <hi>Intelligibility,</hi> which is a Property of <hi>Ens</hi> (Non-Entities and Chimaeras be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Unintelligible) and we can have a kind of <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> or Artificial, Notion of them as <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities,</hi> tho' such a thing <hi>never existed</hi> in the World that we know of; tho', I believe, 'tit hard to conceive, that we can frame a Complex Notion of a Nature that is <hi>Capable to be,</hi> but it exists some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:95549:196"/>
in the Universality of Creatures, here, or elsewhere. How the Mind, using the Fancy, can do this, cannot, I think, be better elucida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than by reflecting on what those, who write of the Excellency of <hi>Poesie</hi> and <hi>Poets,</hi> use to say in Commendation of those <hi>Daedalean</hi> Artists. They tell us that a <hi>Poet</hi> has that Name from the Greek Noun <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifies <hi>A Maker.</hi> The Reason they give for this Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is, that whereas <hi>other</hi> Artists have their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials</hi> given to their Hands to work upon, by shaping it into an Artificial Form; the <hi>Poet</hi> alone is the <hi>Maker</hi> as well of his <hi>Matter,</hi> as the Contriver of its <hi>Form.</hi> So that the <hi>Ideas</hi> he has in his Head of his Heroes, his Lovers, his Ladies, and of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Persons, are indeed (as Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> calls his) <hi>Archetypes,</hi> and regard not whether such Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Patterns he has invented did ever exist in Nature, or no; nor is it to his purpose. Yet still (as Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> says well) that his <hi>Complex Ideas</hi> are made of <hi>Simple</hi> ones, so (by the leave of those Self-magnifiers) the Poet could never have had those Excellent <hi>Ideas</hi> of his <hi>Heroes,</hi> or their great Actions, had he not been pre-imbu'd with <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Notions;</hi> which he joins together ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and exalts them to a high Pitch, so to make them <hi>Exemplars</hi> for others to imitate. Rather, he only adds <hi>Superlative</hi> or <hi>Extraordinary Degrees</hi> to what he <hi>finds in Nature.</hi> Whence 'tis manifest, <hi>he</hi> regards not <hi>what is,</hi> but what <hi>should be;</hi> quite contrary to the Duty of a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> who is to take his Complex Notions from Things, just as he finds them complicated in Nature, and then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon them by his Reason; and not to stand coining new Complex Ideas which Nature
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:95549:197"/>
never gave him. What therefore I most dislike here in Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> is, that he seems not to reflect on what it is which makes some <hi>Ideas</hi> or <hi>Notions more</hi> Simple than <hi>others, viz.</hi> Their being more Abstracted or Universal; for this frees them from the Partnership of more-compounded Differences, and the Complexion of Multitudes of Accidents; (which, still, as they descend lower, are requisit to distinguish the <hi>Kinds</hi> of Things;) by which means they become <hi>more Simple</hi> or <hi>less compounded;</hi> whence, the Supreme Heads of the Ten Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the <hi>Simplest</hi> Notions of all others, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of <hi>Existence.</hi> Did Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> rate the Simplicity and Complexion of his <hi>Ideas</hi> from this certain and well-grounded Rule, there might an easie Accomodation be made between his Doctrin and mine as to this Particular. But his Zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Cobweb Schemes some Modern School-men had woven, transported him to ravel that Excellent Frame of Notions, which both Nature and Art had given us; and, (as <hi>Cartesius</hi> and others have done) to model all Philosophy upon a new, tho' <hi>less Solid,</hi> or rather far from Solid, Foundation.</p>

                  <hi>the Mind,</hi> and not the <hi>Ideas;</hi> and, therefore, it can be no Argument for the Reality of their Knowledge by <hi>Ideas only.</hi> Besides, I deny that when their Ideas are not true Natural Notions but <hi>Fancies,</hi> they <hi>experience</hi> them, or any Effect of them; as in <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or Duration before or after the World. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I answer, That Experience only helps them by giving them <hi>Knowledge;</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> according to them, can only be had by means of <hi>Ideas;</hi> wherefore they must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prove, by <hi>other</hi> Grounds, that <hi>Similitudes</hi> can give us Knowledge of the Things, or they do <hi>petere Principium,</hi> beg the Question, and prove <hi>idem per idem.</hi> For, if meer <hi>Representations</hi> can give us no true Knowledge, <hi>Experience,</hi> which only assists us by giving us <hi>Ideas,</hi> is quite thrown out of doors, and may all be <hi>Fantastical.</hi> All is wrong and falls short, if the <hi>First Ground</hi> of our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be Incompetent and Insignificant. Besides, <hi>Experience</hi> gives us both <hi>Phantasms,</hi> which are <hi>Material</hi> Representations; and our <hi>Notions</hi> too, which are <hi>Spiritual;</hi> but Experience is not duely qualify'd to tell us which is the <hi>one,</hi> and which is the <hi>other;</hi> tho' this be of the highest Concern in our Case: All it can do is to inform us, that we are affected by some Agent working on our Senses. Nay, of the two, it more inclines us to embrace <hi>Phantasms</hi> for Notions; for those do make upon us the more <hi>Sensible</hi> Impression, and cause a <hi>more lively Representation.</hi> To distinguish perfectly between this False and True Ground of Knowledge, is of the most weighty Importance of all other Points of Philosophy whatsoever; and yet I must complain, that not the least Care (as far as I have observ'd) is taken any where in this

Treatise to <hi>distinguish</hi> them; and particularly, not in this Chapter, which had been the proper Place to treat of that Subject: But, on the contrary, (as I have shewn above) they are carelesly <hi>Confounded.</hi> And I must declare, that without settling this Point <hi>well,</hi> we can never have any Certainty what Knowledge is <hi>Real,</hi> what <hi>Fantastick:</hi> Or, when we do <hi>truly know,</hi> when onely <hi>seem to know:</hi> But, there is not a Word here to that purpose.</p>

To discourse this Point from its Fundamental Ground, and declare it Literally: The <hi>Metaphysical Verity</hi> of the Thing, which, put into a Proposition, predicates the <hi>whole Thing</hi> (or Mode) of <hi>it self,</hi> and affirms that the Thing <hi>is what it is,</hi> gives us our <hi>First Truths,</hi> or <hi>First Principles.</hi> And all <hi>other</hi> Truths consists in this, that <hi>Inadequate,</hi> or Partial Notions or Conceptions of the Thing, either as to what is Intrinsecal or Extrinsecal to it, are predicated ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Thing as <hi>in it self,</hi> that is, according to the Line of <hi>Substance,</hi> which are call'd <hi>Essential</hi> Predicates; as, when we say, <hi>Petrus est Animal;</hi> or, as it is affected with some <hi>Mode</hi> consistent in the same Subject; as when we say, <hi>Petrus est Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, Pater, Locatus, Galeatus, Album est Dulce,</hi> &amp;c. and it is impossible there can be any <hi>more</hi> sorts of <hi>Formal Truths</hi> but these <hi>two:</hi> For all Predication is made by some kind of <hi>Identification,</hi> as is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly signify'd by the <hi>Copula [is,]</hi> and there cannot possibly be any other sorts of Identification, but either <hi>in the whole,</hi> or <hi>not in the whole;</hi> that is, <hi>in part,</hi> or according to <hi>Partial</hi> Conceptions of the same Thing; nor can there be any Identifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all of <hi>Ideas;</hi> Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> confessing, that each of them is <hi>what it self is,</hi> and <hi>no other.</hi>

12. I take it to be a strange kind of <hi>Catechresis</hi> to make two sorts of <hi>Truth, Montal</hi> and <hi>Verbal,</hi> and we may with as <note place="margin">The Distinction of Truth into <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> and <hi>Verbal</hi> Extravagant, and the Parts of it Coincident.</note> good Sense say, that a Tavern has <hi>two</hi> sorts of <hi>Wine;</hi> one in the Cellar, the other in the Bush at the Door; for Words are good for nothing in the World but meerly and purely to <hi>Signifie:</hi> So that when we say a <hi>Man speaks True,</hi> the Sense of those Words can be only This, that the Proposition he speaks does <hi>signifie</hi> such a Thought or Judgment in his Mind as is really <hi>Conformable to the Thing</hi> he thought or spoke of: And I wonder this Great Man can imagin that, in our more <hi>Complex</hi> Ideas, we put the <hi>Name</hi> for the <hi>Idea</hi> it self; for then that Name would signifie <hi>Nothing at all,</hi> if neither the <hi>Thing</hi> nor the <hi>Idea</hi> be signified by it, as he seems to hold. Again, Words differ from meer <hi>Sounds</hi> in this, that they have some <hi>Sense</hi> or <hi>Meaning</hi> in them, and <hi>Meanings</hi> are the very <hi>Notions</hi> we have in our Minds: Wherefore the Parts of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of his would be <hi>coincident,</hi> because all <hi>Verbal</hi> Truths (were the Expression proper) would necessarily be <hi>Mental</hi> ones; and Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> seems to say the same, § 8. where he makes those Truths which are <hi>barely Nominal</hi> to be <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical.</hi> I grant too, that Truths may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd, according to their several Subjects, into Moral, Physical, Metaphysical, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I must severely reflect on his describing <hi>Moral Truths,</hi> § 11. to be the <hi>Speaking Things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Perswasion of our own Minds, tho' the Proposition we speak does not agree to the Reality of Things:</hi> For, since it is most Evidently known,

               <p n="1">1. BY what has been deliver'd in my forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reflexion, my Notes upon his 6th Chapter <hi>[Of Universal Propositions, their Truth and Certainty]</hi> will be <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Universal</hi> Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions in the Mind are easily Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to Words.</note> easily understood. But, I am to premise, <hi>First,</hi> That the Question is not here, what <hi>proves</hi> the Truth of such Propositions, which is the work of <hi>Logick;</hi> but, whether there can be any <hi>Truth in</hi> them, or <hi>Certainty of</hi> them at all, or <hi>no. Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Formal Truth</hi> of Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions can onely be in the <hi>Mind;</hi> or, that <hi>Mental</hi> Propositions onely are capable of <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Falsl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood;</hi> tho' Words be needful to <hi>signify</hi> them: And, therefore, I must deny that <hi>The Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Words is a necessary part of the Treatise of Knowledge;</hi> meaning by that word, <hi>Philosophical</hi> Knowledge, as our Circumstance determin us. Let Logicians but take care that the Words be <hi>Univocal,</hi> and not <hi>Equivocal,</hi> or double sensed, and all else that can be consider'd to belong to <hi>Truth,</hi> is to be look'd for in the <hi>Mind,</hi> and can be no where else. Hence, I cannot admit his Distinction of <hi>Certainty of Truth,</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> in any other sense than that <hi>Knowledge</hi> is the <hi>Act,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> the onely <hi>Object</hi> of that Act; since nothing can be <hi>known to be</hi> what <hi>is not;</hi> nor
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:95549:201"/>
                  <hi>known to be True,</hi> which <hi>is not True.</hi> The Generical Notion <hi>[Certainty,]</hi> should first have been explicated, ere those <hi>two sorts</hi> of it had been defin'd; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise both those Definitions must necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Unintelligible. I shall presume that I have in my METHOD shown from its Grounds what <hi>Certainty</hi> is, <hi>viz. The Determination of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, or Judging Power by the Object's actuating it,</hi> or <hi>being actually in it as it is in its self.</hi> With which, what his <hi>putting together of Words</hi> in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal Propositions has to do, surpasses my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. And, 'tis as hard to conceive, that <hi>General Truths can never be well made known, and are very Seldom apprehended, but as conceiv'd and express'd in Words.</hi> That General Truths cannot be made known <hi>to others</hi> without Words, is in a manner, as Evident as 'tis that we cannot <hi>see</hi> one anothers <hi>Thoughts;</hi> nor is this peculiar to <hi>General</hi> Truths, for scarcely can <hi>Particular</hi> ones be made known any other way: But, that they cannot be known or apprehended <hi>by our selves</hi> (which seems here to be his meaning) but as <hi>conceiv'd and express'd in Words,</hi> is so far from Evident, that the Contrary is such; for, it is impossible <hi>to express them in Words,</hi> unless we do <hi>first apprehend</hi> and <hi>conceive</hi> them in our <hi>Thoughts;</hi> and were not this so, all the while we use <hi>Words</hi> in speaking of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Truths, we should do nothing but <hi>talk of we know not what:</hi> For, our <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions</hi> are <hi>ex Natura rei,</hi> presupposed to the <hi>Words</hi> by which we <hi>express</hi> them; and, to do otherwise is to let <hi>our Tongue run before our Wit.</hi> Whence we account them silly and Senseless people, and Perverters of Nature, who make use of <hi>Words</hi> before they know their <hi>Meaning.</hi>

2. I have shown above, that it is not necessary to our being <hi>Certain</hi> of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position that we <hi>know the precise</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>'Tis not necessary to know</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Bounds and Extent of the Species.</note> 
                  <hi>bounds and Extent of the Species it stands for;</hi> but that 'tis sufficient to know it <hi>in part</hi> Distinctly; and the <hi>rest</hi> of it, or the <hi>whole,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly; provided that part of it, which we know is sufficient to <hi>distinguish</hi> it from all <hi>other Species:</hi> And, were not this so, it would follow that we never could know the Truth of any Universal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position whatever; especially when we discourse of the <hi>Species Infima,</hi> which requires a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of very many Accidents, whose precise Number and Bounds are utterly unknowable by us. A Position which makes Logick useless; scarce any Conclusion being deducible from Premisses, unless one of them be an <hi>Universal;</hi> and quite destroyes all <hi>Science</hi> which is employ'd about <hi>Universal</hi> or <hi>General Truths.</hi> He instances in <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Gold,</hi> and judges that, <hi>for want of knowing the Extent of their Species, it is impossible with any Certainty to affirm that all Men are Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, or all Gold yellow.</hi> We cannot indeed know this by considering <hi>every</hi> Individual Man <hi>by the poll:</hi> But, if by the word <hi>[Man]</hi> we mean no more but a <hi>Rational Animal,</hi> it is so far from <hi>Impossible to know,</hi> and affirm that <hi>All Men are Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,</hi> that 'tis <hi>Impossible not to know it.</hi> And, were it a proper place to make good that Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition here, I could demonstrate that it does agree to <hi>Man,</hi> and can agree to nothing else; and therefore that Definition is <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Adequate:</hi> Nor can the contrary be sustaind any other way, but by unacquainting us with our selves and our
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:95549:202"/>
own Kind; and by jumbling together these <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> which are distinguisht by <hi>Contradictory</hi> Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and <hi>Confounding</hi> the vastly-Distinct Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Properties, of <hi>Corporeal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Beings. As for the <hi>Species</hi> of Gold, <hi>Yellowness</hi> (which he instances in) is not <hi>Essential</hi> to it, as <hi>Rationality</hi> is to <hi>Man;</hi> as being but <hi>one</hi> of those Accidents, by which we distinguish it from <hi>other Species</hi> of Minerals; and I have hinted some other formerly, which are more Intrinsecal and Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to it than its <hi>Colour.</hi> Again, we are more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <hi>Certain</hi> by manifest and daily experience, and by the constant and Common Practise of the World, that Mankind is acquainted with <hi>enow</hi> of those Accidents to distinguish it. One bespeaks a Golden Cup, and the Goldsmith makes it for him: Nor was it ever heard that any of this Trade, did hope to Cozen a Sensible Man, by obtruding upon the Buyer Brass, or any other Mettal, for Gold; or, if he did, that Goldsmith's-Hall could not <hi>distinguish</hi> it: Nay, if it be but a little <hi>alloyd,</hi> there are ways to find it out; which shows that Mankind is furnisht with means enow, to distinguish <hi>Gold</hi> from other Mettals, and for the same reason <hi>other</hi> things also; tho' the <hi>Extent</hi> of all the <hi>Species,</hi> and their <hi>precise bounds,</hi> be not exactly known to those Speculaters, who will needs forgo their Natural Knowledge of <hi>Things</hi> to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue Scrupulous <hi>Fancies:</hi> which, let loose to fly at rovers, are too hard for their <hi>Reason</hi> Unesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd by Principles.</p>

3. Hence an Answer is given to Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Acute Difficulty, <hi>viz. That 'tis impossible for us to know that this or</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Unnecessary Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted, nor the Want of it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of.</note> 
                  <hi>that Quality, or Idea, has a necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Connexion with a Real Essence, of which we have no Idea at all;</hi> that is, (according to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,) <hi>no Knowledge.</hi> For, since a <hi>Real Essence</hi> is that which constitutes such a kind of <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>Species;</hi> and what <hi>distinguishes</hi> an <hi>Entity</hi> or <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> from all others, does also make it <hi>this,</hi> or <hi>that Species;</hi> that is, does <hi>constitute</hi> it; it follows, that, since, by my Discourse here, we have such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Knowledge of that kind of <hi>Ens</hi> called <hi>Gold,</hi> as to <hi>distinguish</hi> it from all others, we have a <hi>Sufficient</hi> and <hi>True</hi> (tho' not an <hi>Adequate</hi> and <hi>Distinct)</hi> Knowledge of its <hi>Essence</hi> too, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes it such a kind of <hi>Ens.</hi> Indeed, if nothing will content us but <hi>Superfluous</hi> Knowledge, for Curiosity sake, of each particular Mode that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs</hi> to that Essence, 'tis no wonder if we labour in vain; and, by over-straining to go <hi>beyond our selves</hi> in this State, fall short of our Aim. I must confess, that it would concern us much, as we are, to know whether there be any Quality, which we <hi>do not yet know</hi> in the Thing, <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent</hi> with those we <hi>do know;</hi> for, this would blunder our Notion of it, and make it Chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. But, as it is impossible Creative Wisdom should lay Grounds for Contradiction; so, in case those Qualities be all <hi>Consistent,</hi> where is the harm not to know them? And, since Consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy implies some kind of Agreement or Connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness of the one with the others, who knows how far their Connexion and Dependence may
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:95549:203"/>
be known in time, if right Principles were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and pursu'd? 'Tis a strange dis-satisfy'd Humour in us, to complain <hi>we know not all,</hi> when we know <hi>enough:</hi> I know no Man is more free from this Fault than Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> or declares more against it <hi>formerly.</hi> What I dislike in him in this Point is, that, by his too much Introversion, he <hi>forsakes Nature;</hi> and, by his too nice Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his <hi>Ideas,</hi> hazards to breed a Conceit in his Readers, that they know <hi>less</hi> than they really <hi>do;</hi> and, that we <hi>are not able</hi> to attain half that Knowledge we, in reality, <hi>may</hi> arrive to; which, tho' contrary to his Intention, must needs incline Men to be <hi>Scepticks</hi> as to <hi>Essences</hi> and <hi>Substances.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The 7th Chapter, <hi>[of Maxims,]</hi> is admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Clear, and, in the greatest part of it, very Solid; abating his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <note place="margin">The Nature and Use of General Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims, mistaken by Mr. <hi>Locke.</hi>
                  </note> upon <hi>Ideas,</hi> and applying his Discourses to his former Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis; to which Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> was oblig'd, that all the Parts of his Work might be woven of the same Piece, and Consonant to one another. He explicates very well, how they are <hi>Self-evident:</hi> Yet, tho' they be such, he has three Exceptions against them; 1. As not being <hi>First known;</hi> 2. As, in a manner, <hi>Useless;</hi> and 3. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</hi> He proves the First, because <hi>Particulars are known before Universals.</hi> I understand him not. Knowledge may be either consider'd, as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still'd</hi> by insensible Degrees, into <hi>Infants,</hi> or the <hi>Ruder Sort;</hi> or, as Reducible to the clearest Grounds, <hi>by Men of Art.</hi> Now, I cannot think that Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> imagins, that we, or any Man, hold that <hi>Maxims</hi> were meant for <hi>Infants,</hi> or the <hi>Vulgar;</hi> or, that either of them ought to be
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:95549:204"/>
taught <hi>General</hi> Principles <hi>at first,</hi> and by them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Particular Knowledges; or, that the <hi>Users</hi> of Maxims ever intended them for that end. Wherefore, all his Discourses to prove them not to be <hi>First-known,</hi> may be allow'd to have their full Force, and yet hurt no body, being wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levell'd. The Point then is, how they may avail Artists, or Speculators: And this leads to his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Exception, their pretended <hi>Uselesness;</hi> which he endeavours to shew, by alledging, that 'tis as Evident as any Maxim whatever, that <hi>the same Idea, is the same Idea, and no other;</hi> v. g. that <hi>the Idea of Yellow is the Idea of Yellow, and not of Blue;</hi> and, therefore, that <hi>Maxims serve to little purpose,</hi> and are also <hi>Innumerable.</hi> Now, I grant, indeed, that all such <hi>particular</hi> Propositions may be <hi>Self-evident,</hi> and <hi>Truths;</hi> as also, that Truths of <hi>this</hi> kind, which express the Metaphysical Verity and Unity of every <hi>Thing,</hi> and of every <hi>Mode</hi> of Thing, are <hi>Innumerable.</hi> But, I do not think that any Man living thought those to have the Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Maxims</hi> or <hi>Principles,</hi> which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>General,</hi> or <hi>Universal:</hi> For, the Notion of <hi>[Principles]</hi> super-adds to their being <hi>Truths,</hi> and <hi>Self-evident,</hi> that they <hi>influence</hi> many <hi>other</hi> Truths that are (as it were) <hi>under them;</hi> which cannot be said, or thought, of those <hi>particular</hi> Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For example; Should any one go about to refund the Verity of this Truth, <hi>Yellow is Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and not Blue,</hi> into this, because <hi>White is White, and not Black,</hi> it would look more like a <hi>Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> than a <hi>Reason;</hi> and be ridiculous to alledge the <hi>one</hi> to be the <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>other;</hi> because <hi>Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> is not <hi>White;</hi> nor has the Notion of the <hi>one</hi> any Influence upon, nor any thing to do with the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:95549:204"/>
Notion of the <hi>other;</hi> in regard both of them stand upon the same Bottom, or on the same Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. But, should any Sceptick ask <hi>why the Idea of Yellow is the Idea of Yellow?</hi> tho' 'tis foolish to ask it, yet, it would not look so extravagant to answer, because <hi>Every thing is what it is:</hi> And, I believe, Nature would force Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> or any other to give this for his Reason. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, should he ask why a Man is a Man? It would look preter-natural to answer, because <hi>a Tree is a Tree,</hi> Whereas, it would look very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to answer, because <hi>Every Thing is it Self,</hi> or, <hi>is what it is.</hi> Which shews to an Acute Reflecter, that this <hi>Universal</hi> has some kind of <hi>Influence</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Others,</hi> which their <hi>Fellow-Particulars</hi> had not. And, the Reason is, because Universals do <hi>engage</hi> for all the Particulars under them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, one Particular owes not this Duty to another Particular, to which it has no such <hi>Real Relation</hi> as the Notion of an <hi>Universal</hi> has in the Mind to its <hi>Particulars.</hi> And, Who sees not, that, from this Proposition, <hi>Every Man is Rational,</hi> it follows, that <hi>Peter, John,</hi> and each particular Man, is <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional?</hi> But, from this, that <hi>Peter,</hi> and a few other Particulars, are Rational, it does not follow, that <hi>Every Man is Rational:</hi> Wnich shews, that (as was now said) the Truth of the Universal <hi>engages</hi> for the Truth of <hi>all</hi> Particulars, and not <hi>vice-ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sâ;</hi> nor one of them for another.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another Reason for the <hi>Usefulness</hi> of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Maxims, and, why Artists use to reduce the Truth of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars <note place="margin">The Terms of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Maxims</hi> Clearer than those of <hi>Particular Propositions.</hi>
                  </note> to them, is, because they are <hi>more Self-Evident</hi> than the Particular Identicals are. This
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:95549:205"/>
Position looks something odd; for, since <hi>Self-Evidence</hi> is the <hi>highest</hi> Evidence that can be, to put <hi>Degrees</hi> of Self-evidence, is to say, there can be something <hi>Higher</hi> than the <hi>Highest;</hi> which looks like a Bull. To clear this Point, I discourse thus: In all Self-evident Propositions whatever, the Terms are so <hi>closely Connected,</hi> (being, indeed, <hi>the same,)</hi> that no Middle Term can come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, so to <hi>prove</hi> them Connected, or <hi>make</hi> them Evident; wherefore, they must either not be <hi>Evident at all,</hi> (which were shameless to say,) or they must be <hi>Evident of themselves;</hi> that is, <hi>Self-evident.</hi> And, in <hi>this</hi> regard, or in the <hi>Closest Connexion</hi> or <hi>Identity</hi> of their Terms, all Self-evident Propositions are <hi>Equally</hi> such. But, there is another kind of Evidence arising out of the <hi>Greater Clearness</hi> of the <hi>Terms</hi> themselves. Now, it has been shewn formerly, that all Clearness of our Notions springs out of their <hi>Simplicity,</hi> and Uncompoundedness; and all <hi>Obscurity</hi> out of their <hi>Composition,</hi> which breeds Confusion: As also, that all <hi>General</hi> Notions are <hi>more Simple,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, <hi>more clear</hi> than the Particulars are. Whence follows, that the Proposition, which has <hi>more-general</hi> Terms in it, (such as all General Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims are,) do gain hence a <hi>greater Degree</hi> of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and are <hi>more Undeniable.</hi> For example; Let Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> tell a Sceptick, that <hi>Yellow is Yellow, and not Blue;</hi> he may answer, that he will yield to neither Proposition; because, <hi>Yellow</hi> and <hi>Blue</hi> are <hi>Species</hi> of Colour, and (according to Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Grounds) he knows not the <hi>distinct Bounds,</hi> or <hi>precise Extent</hi> of neither of them; and therefore, should he grant it, he must assent to <hi>he knows not what.</hi> Tell him, Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> speaks of the <hi>Ideas</hi> of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:95549:205"/>
those Colours; he will ask what an <hi>Idea</hi> is, and, doubtless, pick new Quarrels at the Definition; especially, these being the <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>Secondary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi> which himself says, have nothing <hi>Like</hi> them in the <hi>Thing.</hi> But, tell him, it cannot be deny'd, but that they are <hi>Something,</hi> and not meerly <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> in regard we <hi>experience</hi> we have them; and, that <hi>Every Thing must necessarily be what it is,</hi> (which is one of the Maxims excepted against;) he will be put to a Stand, and Nonpluss'd: For, what can he say? The Identity of the <hi>Thing</hi> with it self, whether it be a Substance, or an Accident, cannot be deny'd; nor can he deny, that <hi>the same is the same with it self,</hi> (which is another Maxim;) for, the Word <hi>Thing,</hi> signifies, a <hi>Supream</hi> Generi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Notion; and, the Word <hi>Same,</hi> is a Transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; which are both of them <hi>Clear,</hi> because the Latter has no kind of Composition in it, the Other as little as is possible. So that he cannot begin to shuffle here, or press to know the meaning of the Terms, as he did when they were Particulars; the <hi>Universal Terms</hi> being far <hi>Clearer</hi> than those Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars are.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence another Usefulness of <hi>Self-evident Maxims</hi> is discover'd; which is, not to <hi>deduce</hi> Conclusions <hi>from</hi>

Discourses: For, Whence could they have this strange Virtue <hi>to stop the Mouths</hi> of such Unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Men, but because their Evidence is <hi>Greater</hi> than any <hi>others,</hi> or than Particular Self-evident Propositions are? Otherwise, why could not <hi>these</hi> do it as well as <hi>General Maxims?</hi> Now, if this be so, why cannot they <hi>satisfie</hi> and <hi>instruct</hi> Rational Men, and conduce to quiet and <hi>fix</hi> their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as to <hi>Nonplus</hi> Wranglers? 'Tis the Nature of <hi>Evidence,</hi> to <hi>enlighten</hi> and <hi>instruct</hi> Men of Sense; and more Proper to it, than to <hi>amuse</hi> and <hi>surprize</hi> Sophisters. Let any Learned Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on all the Maxims in <hi>Euclid</hi>'s <hi>Elements,</hi> in <hi>Euclides Physicus</hi> and <hi>Metaphysicus,</hi> or any other Author who pretends to Reasoning with <hi>Exact Closeness;</hi> and he will easily see <hi>for what</hi> they are Useful, and <hi>How.</hi> Nay, even Mr. <hi>L.</hi>'s Identicals, <hi>[Yellow is Yellow, and not Blue,]</hi> are useful in their Kind. tho' Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> does omit to shew they are so: And this Identical <hi>Yellow</hi> is <hi>Yellow,</hi> tho' it do not <hi>influence</hi> other Particulars, as <hi>General Maxims</hi> do; (for which Reason, it does not absolutely deserve the Name of a <hi>Principle;)</hi> yet, both It, (and such other Particular Identicals,) is a kind of Principle to all that is, or can be, discoursed about that Particular Colour: For, if any part of that Discourse makes Yellow <hi>not to be Yellow,</hi> or (which is all one) violates that Proposition, <hi>[Yellow is Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,]</hi> 'tis concluded to be most evidently <hi>False;</hi> or, if it agrees with it, to be <hi>True.</hi> He seems to mislike the Procedure by <hi>Praecognita</hi> and <hi>Praecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessa;</hi> whereas, his Acute Wit will find, upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, that it is impossible we can make an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, much less any Speculative, Discourse, but the Discoursers must agree in something that is
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:95549:206"/>
either <hi>Foreknown,</hi> or (at least) <hi>Foregranted;</hi> for, if the two Disputants disagree in <hi>all</hi> their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Grounds, and one of them still <hi>denies <hi>All</hi>

               <p n="7">7. But, passing by all that is said, I alledge far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that (not to speak of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) these two Maxims so <note place="margin">The Absolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of First Principles Assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> much excepted against, <hi>[What it is]</hi> and <hi>['Tis impossible the same Thing should be and not be at once,</hi> are of such most Necessary and Universal Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that, without them, we could neither <hi>judge, discourse,</hi> nor <hi>act.</hi> Indeed, these Maxims lie <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truse</hi> in the most Inmost Recesses of our Judging or Intellective Power, and make not their Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in Formal Propositions, but only when we have occasion to produce them; tho' they are still <hi>there</hi> all the while, and guide all our Thoughts steadily, nay, all our Actions too. In the same manner as when a Musician plays a careless Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary upon a Harpsichord, he guides himself all along by the Rules of Musick lodg'd in his Mind; tho', they being now <hi>familiar</hi> to him, he is not so Sensible of those Rules as he was when he first learn'd them. To apprehend more clearly the Usefulness of these two Principles, let us suppose a Man <hi>quite Devested</hi> of them, and to have neither of them in his Judgment, and then reflect what he is good for. All our Judgments being made by the <hi>Copula [is,]</hi> in case he have not this First Principle in his Understanding, he might take <hi>[is]</hi> for <hi>[is not;]</hi> or else indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for one, and the other too: which, besides the perverting his Judgment quite, would make him
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:95549:207"/>
utterly unfit for the Conversation of Mankind Again, 'tis impossible such a Man should have <hi>any Truth</hi> at all in his Mind, which is the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perfection of Human Understanding; but, wanting a steady Ground to <hi>fix</hi> his Judgment, he might think all things to be <hi>Chimerical,</hi> embrace every <hi>Fancy,</hi> and adhere to any <hi>Contradiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. To come to the Usefulness of <hi>other</hi> General Maxims, we may reflect how Mankind do naturally guide their <note place="margin">How other General Maxims do govern all our Actions and Sayings.</note> Actions by them. A Country Butcher loses his Knife, and looks all about for it; in which case 'tis usual for such Fellows to say, as the Motive of his continuing to seek it, <hi>[I am sure it must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where or other.]</hi> By which rude Saying 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that he guides himself all the while by this foreknown General Maxim, <hi>[Every particular Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the World must be in some place.]</hi> For, had he not had the Knowledge of this Maxim before-hand, that is, did he think it were possible it should be <hi>no where,</hi> or <hi>in no place,</hi> he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have taken such Pains to look for it. We may observe Hundreds of such Natural Maxims as this in the Vulgar, guiding their Actions and Sayings; and perhaps, it would not be unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Speculaters to observe their Behaviour and Words which proceed from Uncorrupted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and retrieve the Genuin Principles and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims that naturally produced them. To apply this: The same we may gather from our Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Thoughts; and that the same passes in us naturally as does in the Vulgar.

                  </note> This Ingenious Author thinks the need of such Maxims might be supply'd by having <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Distinct Ideas.</hi> Which, rightly understood, comes over to us; for Art and Nature both inform us, that the <hi>Clearness</hi> of our Notions consists in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more <hi>General;</hi> and as they approach nearer to the <hi>Highest Genus,</hi> they are still <hi>Clearer.</hi> Now, the Metaphysical Verity of a <hi>General Idea</hi> or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if put into a Proposition, is perfectly <hi>Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and a <hi>General Maxim.</hi> Hence appears, that it is a most Fundamental Errour in the <hi>Ideists,</hi> that they rate the <hi>Clearness</hi> of their <hi>Ideas</hi> from the

fresh, fair and lively Appearances they make to the <hi>Fancy.</hi> Whereas only the Definition, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating the true Essence of a Thing, shews us Distinctly the true <hi>Spiritual Notion</hi> of it.

Hence the Followers of Fancy become liable to take <hi>Similitudes</hi> for <hi>Notions,</hi> and <hi>Representations</hi> for <hi>Things;</hi> which makes their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions very Plausible to other Men's Fancies, (for as they were the Productions of <hi>Fancy,</hi> so they sute best with Men of Fancy) but they fall short of instructing their <hi>Judgments.</hi> To give an Instance of this Distinction of Notions from Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasms: They think that the <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Quadrate</hi> (for Example) or <hi>Circle,</hi> is very <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct;</hi> and that the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Quantity</hi> is very <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure</hi> and <hi>Confused:</hi> Whereas, to the Notion of the two former, there goes the Notion both of <hi>Quantity,</hi> of the <hi>Termination of Quantity,</hi> (or <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure;)</hi> and, moreover, of <hi>such</hi> a Figure; all which being Essentially involv'd in the Notion of a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate or Circle, must needs make their Notions <hi>less Intelligible</hi> and <hi>less Clear</hi> than is that of <hi>Quantity only:</hi> However, the fair Pictures of the former, on Paper, or in the Fancy, enveigles them to think otherwise. Let us but reflect how many Truths are deduced by Geometricians out of the
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:95549:208"/>
Notions of a Quadrate or a Circle, and what large Treatises of Trigonometry are drawn out of the Notion or Nature of a <hi>Triangle;</hi> and we shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover how Compounded and Confused those No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are <hi>in reality,</hi> however we seem, while we mind only the <hi>Pictures</hi> of them, to have very clear Conceptions of them, and to comprehend them <hi>distinctly</hi> and <hi>fully.</hi> Now, all these Truths are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd</hi> confusedly in the Notion or Nature of these Figures: For all Discourses concerning any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatever, are nothing but <hi>running Division</hi> (as we may say) upon the <hi>Nature</hi> of that <hi>Object</hi> as their <hi>Ground;</hi> and all Descants upon it are meerly that very Notion <hi>Unfolded</hi> and Explicated at large, and consider'd on all sides, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Which, comprising them all in its Bowels, is therefore not so <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Distinct</hi> as Fancy makes us imagin. Whence is seen evidently, that <hi>Fancy,</hi> and the <hi>first</hi> and obvious <hi>Appearance,</hi> is not to be the <hi>Judge</hi> or <hi>Test</hi> of the <hi>Clearness</hi> or <hi>Confusedness</hi> of our Notions; but <hi>Reason,</hi> reflecting well on the <hi>Simplicity</hi> or <hi>Compoundedness</hi> of those Notions themselves, and on the <hi>Reasons why</hi> they are so.</p>

All our Grounds must fail us, when we do not distinguish between the <hi>Mode</hi> or <hi>Manner how</hi> a Thing is, and the <hi>Thing it self.</hi> Nor do I think <hi>Cartesius</hi> holds Body to be <hi>Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> but <hi>Extended Matter.</hi> How Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> comes not to treat of <hi>Matter</hi> in his whole Book, I know not; but I fear it is, because his <hi>Fancy</hi> cannot frame an <hi>Idea</hi> or <hi>Similitude</hi> of it: By which it seems to me Evident, that very many of his <hi>Ideas</hi> are meer <hi>Fancies,</hi> coin'd by his Imagination: For, 'tis evident he must have a <hi>Notion</hi> of it, since he
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:95549:210"/>
very well knows the <hi>meaning</hi> of those <hi>Words, [A Power to be a Thing,</hi> or <hi>Matter;]</hi> which Meaning is the same with our <hi>Notion</hi> of it. As for <hi>Vacuum,</hi> which he again mentions here, my Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against it, is, in short, this; waving many others mention'd above: All our Natural Notions are taken from <hi>Body;</hi> and, amongst them, that of <hi>Space;</hi> therefore they are nothing but <hi>Body</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequately consider'd; and either <hi>Body,</hi> or some <hi>Mode</hi> of Body: Therefore, whatever our Fancy may suggest, it is impossible there should be <hi>Space,</hi> where there is <hi>no Body;</hi> since the Mode, having no distinct Entity of <hi>its own,</hi> cannot be where the <hi>Thing,</hi> which gives it Being, <hi>is not:</hi> Therefore, to put <hi>Space</hi> where there is <hi>no Body,</hi> or a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> is a direct Contradiction. Each Part of which Discourse has been made good in its proper place.</p>
               <p n="12">12. In his Second Instance of <hi>Man,</hi> he seems again, not to distinguish between the <hi>Fancy</hi> and the <hi>Notion</hi> of a <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ideism</hi> is the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuin Parent of Enthusiasm in Philosophy.</note>

Next, he seems not to reflect, that an <hi>Imperfect</hi> Conception of the Thing, is of the <hi>whole</hi> Thing confusedly. Thirdly, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that Men do only <hi>err,</hi> or discourse <hi>wrong,</hi> by imperfectly conceiving, thro' this Reason; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not so wise as to consider that there may be <hi>more Modes</hi> wrap'd up in the Thing, than we yet <hi>distinctly discover:</hi> In which case, they may <hi>err</hi> by <hi>mis-applying</hi> their General Maxims; for which they must blame themselves, and not the Maxim it self. But, I absolutely deny that any Man can possibly have the true and distinct
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:95549:211"/>
Notion of <hi>Man,</hi> unless he conceives him to be <hi>Rational.</hi> As for what he tells us, <hi>he has discours'd with very Rational Men, who have actually deny'd they are Men;</hi> I can only say, I wonder how they escap'd <hi>Bedlam;</hi> where, I dare say, there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men, who are <hi>more Rational</hi> than <hi>they:</hi> And, my Opinion is, that those <hi>very Rational Men</hi> were very high-flown <hi>Ideists:</hi> For, such Men, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting their Natural Notions taken from the <hi>Things,</hi> and the Conduct of true Logick, and <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> perpetually on their <hi>own Interiour;</hi> and being withall unable to see the Difference between those <hi>Ideas</hi> they find there, or to distinguish betwixt <hi>Fancies</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Conceptions; are (unless they be otherwise Masters of an Excellent <hi>Genius)</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally disposed by their Principles to be <hi>Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in Philosophy;</hi> and to entertain as wild Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as the Deepest <hi>Enthusiasts.</hi> Witness <hi>Cartesius</hi> his mad Fit of Enthusiasm, which lasted some Days, when he was laying his Principles, (as is writ in his Life;) and those <hi>Self-strangers,</hi> now spoken of, <hi>who actually deny'd they were Men:</hi> Whom, (to requite Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> with a parallel Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) I cannot liken so well to any thing, as to a famous Humourist, one <hi>John Band,</hi> who serv'd my Lady <hi>Wootton,</hi> in <hi>Kent:</hi> This Fellow, in the Heat of Summer, going out in a Cart, drawn by two Horses, fell asleep in the Cart: The Horses not hearing any cry <hi>Gee, ho,</hi> to urge them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, took their Opportunity to rest themselves, and stood still: A Companion of his coming by, and seeing how matters stood, under-propp'd the Cart, took out the Horses; and; having set them up, return'd, and lay behind the Hedge, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how <hi>John</hi> would behave himself when he
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:95549:211"/>
miss'd his Horses: Who awaking, got up, rub'd his Eyes, and, in the Dawning of his Reason, broke out, (to himself,) in these Words, <hi>Either now I am</hi> John Band, <hi>or I am not</hi> John Band: <hi>If I am</hi> John Band, <hi>I have e'en lost two Horses; But, if I am not</hi> John Band, <hi>I have found a Cart.</hi> So that all <hi>John</hi>'s Hopes were, that he was <hi>not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi> for then he had been on the better hand.

               <p n="13">13. But, to be serious; I cannot but admire that this Ingenious Author should, in his 8th Chapter, so ridicule <note place="margin">Identical Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not to be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicul'd.</note> 
                  <hi>Identical Propositions,</hi> or esteem them <hi>Trifling.</hi> He told us in his 2d Chapter, that that Knowledge he calls <hi>Intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> is of <hi>Self-evident</hi> Propositions; and Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ones are such. He assures us, that in <hi>every Step Reason makes</hi> in <hi>Demonstrative Knowledge, there is an Intuitive Knowledge of the Agreement</hi> or <hi>Disagreement of our Ideas;</hi> Consonantly to which, I have demonstrated in my <hi>Method, Book</hi> 3. <hi>Liss.</hi> 1. §. 3. that all the Force of <hi>Consequence,</hi> which gives the Nerves to all our Discourse, must be an <hi>Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Proposition.</hi> Moreover, he says, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. that we know <hi>each Idea to be it self, and not another;</hi> and, that no <hi>Abstract Idea can be the same with any other, but with it self;</hi> which are perfectly Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Speeches, and equivalent to these, <hi>The same is the same with it self;</hi> or, <hi>Every Thing is what it is;</hi> nay, and <hi>General Maxims</hi> too, against which he
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:95549:212"/>
shew'd himself much offended in that Chapter. Nor, do I doubt, but that he judges, his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by <hi>Ideas</hi> is refunded into those <hi>Identicals,</hi> as its Ground; as will be shewn shortly. Now, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this, to rally Identical Propositions after such a rate, is to me <hi>Unintelligible.</hi> But, I shall be briefer here upon this Subject, having demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in my <hi>Method, Book</hi> 2. <hi>Less.</hi> 2, and 3. by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Arguments, which, I am very confident, are Unanswerable, that all <hi>First Principles</hi> must be <hi>Identical Propositions:</hi> Whence, either those Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments must be shewn Invalid, or it must be forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deny'd by him that there are any First Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <hi>at all;</hi> which all Mankind, unless they be perfect Scepticks, do grant, and Common Sense forces us to acknowledge. For, if there be no <hi>Supream</hi> or <hi>First</hi> Principles, 'tis impossible there should be any <hi>Inferior</hi> or <hi>Subordinate</hi> ones; and so, Mankind must talk ramblingly, and <hi>at random,</hi> all their Lives, without any Principles or Grounds <hi>at all.</hi> But, waving all the other aforesaid Proofs, I would beg of him to consider this one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: We may speak of, or (which is the same) put into Propositions, all other Considerations or Notions of the Thing, whether they be in the <hi>same</hi> Line, or be the divers <hi>Modes</hi> of it; we can <hi>say,</hi> without danger of being reproach'd, that <hi>Socrates</hi> is a <hi>Man,</hi> an <hi>Animal,</hi> a <hi>Yard high, White,</hi> a <hi>Father, writing, &amp;c.</hi> and 'tis a hard Case if we may not be allow'd to <hi>say something</hi> of the <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physical Verity</hi> of the Thing, this being that on which <hi>all Truth</hi> is built; and without which, all we <hi>could</hi> say would be <hi>False;</hi> and all the World, a <hi>Chaos</hi> of <hi>Chimoera's.</hi> And, if we may <hi>say</hi> any thing of it, I defie all Mankind to shew me, that

                  <hi>that Saying</hi> can be any other but an <hi>Identical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</hi> This being so, I alledge farther, that as all Truths are <hi>fundamentally</hi> built on the Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Verity of Things; so all <hi>Formal Truths,</hi> or <hi>True Propositions,</hi> must be grounded on <hi>such</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions as <hi>express</hi> or <hi>signifie</hi> that Metaphysical Verity, or, <hi>say</hi> that a <hi>Thing is what it is;</hi> and, consequently, <hi>such</hi> Propositions, and <hi>onely such,</hi> can be <hi>First Principles.</hi> Now, if <hi>First Principles,</hi> and that which grounds all the Force of <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> may be called <hi>Trifling,</hi> I desire to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd what can be called <hi>Solid, Serious</hi> and <hi>Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>

               <p n="14">14. I perceive, by Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s managing his Discourse here, that his Dislike of Identical Propositions springs <note place="margin">The right Way how to use them, and that Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> himself <hi>does</hi> and <hi>must</hi> rely upon them.</note> from his Mistake of our <hi>Manner of Using them.</hi> He seems to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin that we would place them in <hi>Capite Libri,</hi> (as it were,) and thence <hi>deduce</hi> Conclusions from them; or else, that we consider them in their bare selves, without Relation to any thing else: Whence he, with good Reason, affirms, they <hi>do not instruct us, or teach us any thing,</hi> that there is <hi>no Real Knowledge</hi> got by them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Business is quite otherwise: They are the First, and most evident Truths, fix'd and rivetted by Rational Nature, in our Understanding; at the Bottom of which they lie, perhaps Unseen, and and Unreflected on; yet so, that they give the perfect Light to guide all our Thoughts and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses. Whence it comes, that Speculaters do by Art, what the <note place="margin">

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:95549:213"/>
make them the Ultimate <hi>Ressort</hi> of all their Persuasions, and endeavour to <hi>Reduce</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve</hi> all their other Knowledges into <hi>them:</hi> This will appear evident to any Man who reflects, that, if those be <hi>False,</hi> or we be not <hi>pre-imbu'd</hi> with them, we could have <hi>no Truth,</hi> nor <hi>any Knowledge</hi> at all. They are such deep-laid Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, that all Science is rais'd upon them, tho' they make no Formal Appearance in the Symmetry or Beauty of that Structure: Nay, even those who rally them as <hi>Dry,</hi> and <hi>Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi> must be forc'd, for their own Interest, to have recourse to them: For, unless Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> does first know, that each <hi>Idea</hi> he has, <hi>is it self,</hi> and not <hi>another,</hi> which is an Identical Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he must confess he could have no <hi>Distinct Ideas;</hi> at least, no Knowledge that they are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct; whence, the Fabrick of his whole Book would fall to the Ground. After which Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Support from them, in requital, to call them <hi>Trifling,</hi> is not so gentile a Return. Hence is seen, that we make no other Use of them, than himself <hi>does,</hi> and <hi>must</hi> do, or neither of us can possibly speak one Word of Sense; for, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he, without them, <hi>(suppos'd</hi> and <hi>held,</hi> at least, in his Mind, if not <hi>express'd,)</hi> be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of any <hi>Idea;</hi> nor we, of any <hi>Notion</hi> we have; nor, consequently, could either of us build any Discourse upon them. Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> acknowledges, <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 32. that the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical Truth of his Ideas do contain a Tacit Proposition:</hi> Which being so, what Blame can we deserve <hi>for Speaking out,</hi> or <hi>Writing</hi> what is <hi>tacitly</hi> in our Minds? The chief Reason why we put those <hi>Tacit</hi> Propositions into <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi>
                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:95549:213"/>
ones, is for the Scepticks sakes; who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an utter Aversion against Metaphysicks, would not heed the Metaphysical Verity of Things, unless it were produced, and forced upon them, by putting it into such an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Form of Speech as all Mankind uses, and <hi>must grant.</hi> Whence, as Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> confesses that they are <hi>very useful to stop the Mouths of Wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers;</hi> so, Experience teaches us, they are of no less Use to convert or confute Scepticks: Nay, absolutely <hi>Necessary</hi> for that End; because Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks will not admit any thing to be True, but <hi>Identical Propositions</hi> onely. For which reason, I have attempted, in my <hi>Method,</hi> to give some Hints how to <hi>reduce</hi> all others to them. I once thought to have written a particular Treatise on that Subject; but, I hope those short Hints I gave there, may excite some other Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to perfect what, having a large Field of Matter to pass thorow, I did there but briefly touch upon. All this while, I am well aware that Mr. <hi>Locke, Book</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. mentions other <hi>Self-evident Propositions,</hi> which are not Identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; but then, he acknowledges withall, that unless those <hi>Ideas,</hi> which make the two Terms of those Propositions, be fix'd in their own Natures to be <hi>such,</hi> or to be <hi>themselves</hi> onely, and therefore <hi>not to be Another,</hi> none of those Propositions could be evident at all. So that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be known to be True, or be Evident, but by having recourse, <hi>finally,</hi> to <hi>Identical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</hi>

15. Another sort of <hi>Trifling</hi> Propositions, he says, is <hi>when a part of the Complex Idea is Predicated of the Name of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Neither <hi>Ideas</hi> nor <hi>Names</hi> can be Predicate or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but the <hi>Thing</hi> it self, as conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us, in <hi>whole</hi> or in <hi>part.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>the whole;</hi> that is, the <hi>Genus</hi> or <hi>Difference</hi> of the <hi>Species.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; What have we to do with <hi>Ideas</hi> when we Predicate? For <hi>Predicating</hi> is the <hi>Saying</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Another which we call the Subject: If then the <hi>Thing</hi> it self be not Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, then (to <hi>Predicate</hi> being to <hi>Say)</hi> we do not <hi>talk</hi> or <hi>speak</hi> of <hi>It,</hi> but perhaps of our own <hi>Fancies;</hi> especially since Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> has declared, <hi>B.</hi> 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. § 8. that he takes <hi>Idea</hi> indifferently for <hi>what is meant</hi> by <hi>Phantasm</hi> or by <hi>Notion. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> What means [Predicated of the <hi>Name</hi> of the whole.] For, if the <hi>Name</hi> of the Subject have not some <hi>Idea,</hi> or <hi>Notion,</hi> or some <hi>Thing</hi> for its Signification, 'tis <hi>insignificant,</hi> and a <hi>meer useless Sound:</hi> and, if it have, then the <hi>Notion</hi> of the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> or <hi>Genus</hi> is that which is Predicated, and not the <hi>Name</hi> onely. If <hi>Things,</hi> (of which <hi>onely,</hi> as Philosophers, we ought to speak) are turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ideas, Realities</hi> into Spiritual <hi>Resemblances,</hi> and those <hi>Empty Resemblances</hi> into Emptier <hi>Names,</hi> Philosophy will be brought to a strange pass. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> None ever intended to <hi>instruct</hi> Men by this Proposition <hi>[Homo est Animal;]</hi> because eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man knows it already, who knows what the Word <hi>[Man]</hi> means; without knowing which, 'tis impossible to know any thing by any Word whatever; nor are such Propositions as that, which frequently occur in Logicians, meant for any thing but meerly for <hi>Examples</hi> of such and such Predications: But yet, Nature tells us how In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:95549:214"/>
it is on all occasions, to know what <hi>sort</hi> or <hi>kind</hi> (whether General or Specifical) every thing is, and how it <hi>differs</hi> from others of the <hi>same</hi> kind. Now, Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> contrary to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in other occasions, will neither allow us to predicate the <hi>whole</hi> Definition of the Thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd (as was seen above in the Definition of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension)</hi> because 'tis the <hi>same</hi> Notion with that which is Defin'd; nor <hi>Part</hi> of the Definition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>same;</hi> and yet Common Reason assures us no Predication is True, unless the Subject and Predicate be, <hi>in part</hi> or <hi>wholly</hi> the <hi>same;</hi> as the Sense of the <hi>Copula [est]</hi> tells us. I wish Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> would put Mankind into a <hi>wiser</hi> Method; for they have, it seems, done nothing, but perpetually <hi>trifled</hi> hitherto.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Upon the main, he would have nothing that is <hi>Essential</hi> predicated of <hi>Man,</hi> or any other <hi>Species,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>L.</hi>'s new <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive</hi> Way is utterly Insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</note> the Word signifies <hi>that</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready) but only what's <hi>Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> to him; and he thinks that then a Proposition is <hi>Instructive,</hi> when it tells us something not contain'd in the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Man.</hi> He instances in this; <hi>[In whatever Thing, Sense, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Reason, and Laughter are united, that Thing has actually a Notion of God.]</hi> Now this he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, does tell us <hi>more</hi> than barely what the Word <hi>[Man]</hi> means; and therefore has <hi>somewhat of Instruction in it.</hi> I much approve his Design of bringing Disparate Notions to <hi>close</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect: But yet I must say, that all he can say of <hi>Man,</hi> or any other thing, must either be taken from the <hi>Intrinsecal Nature</hi> of the <hi>Thing</hi> it self, or it can never be Instructive, Solid, or capable of
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:95549:215"/>
Demonstration. <hi>V. g.</hi> It is Essential to Man to <hi>have</hi> Natural Notions, and to <hi>connect</hi> those Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons orderly by his Reason, and by doing this he <hi>may attain</hi> to the Knowledge there is a <hi>God.</hi> Now, all this is contain'd in the Notion of <hi>Man;</hi> only it requires a deeper Inspection into that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a more particular Reflexion upon what the Word <hi>[Man]</hi> signifies. For (quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Sentiment) 'tis the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Thing,</hi> signified by its <hi>Name,</hi> which only can <hi>Instruct</hi> us <hi>Solidly;</hi> and it instructs us by our Attention to it, and our frequent and penetrative Reflexion on it. Whence I cannot commend his Instance, nor see how the Predicate <hi>[has the Notion of God]</hi> can ever be connected with the Subject he puts, by virtue of any thing found in the Subject it self as he exhibits it. <hi>Sense</hi> belongs to Man as he is an <hi>Animal, Motion</hi> as he is a <hi>Living</hi> thing; from neither of which Considerations such a Connexion of the Terms are likely to follow. <hi>Reason</hi> is the most likely; but since Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> holds, that <hi>Brutes</hi> too have <hi>some</hi> Reason, and yet can have <hi>no Notion of God,</hi> it cannot be deduced out of the Common Word <hi>[Reason,]</hi> that Man has any such Notion. <hi>Laughter</hi> there should seem, according to him, to be the <hi>most peculiar</hi> to Mankind; for Brutes do <hi>not laugh at all;</hi> but this is less likely than the others to be that precise Consideration, by virtue of which Man comes to <hi>have the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </hi> Again, in his Discourse against <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Principles,</hi> he declar'd his Opinion, that there were some Men who had <hi>actually <hi>no Notion</hi> of a <hi>God</hi>
                  </hi> at all; tho', no doubt, they had Sense, Motion, Reason, and Laughter too. So that if this Proposition be <hi>Instructive,</hi> it can (even ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:95549:215"/>
to himself) instruct us in nothing but an <hi>Errour. Lastly,</hi> What needs this Circumlocution?

Or, if this be meant for an Instructive Definition, as it must, (for the Subject in that Proposition agrees to nothing but to <hi>Man)</hi> why are the Parts of it so disparate, and <hi>so many?</hi> Or rather if <hi>so many,</hi> why <hi>no more?</hi> If we may gain the Knowledge of more Accidents in every <hi>Species</hi> by degrees, as 'tis granted we may; and that we ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine those <hi>Species,</hi> not by the old beaten way of <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Difference,</hi> but by this new one, of cluttering together confusedly the Multitudes of Accidents we find in them, we may come in time, by finding still more and more, to have Definitions so large, that the whole side of a Leaf cannot hold them, nor Man's Memory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them; and then what do they serve for?</p>

               <p n="1">1. THis Excellent Author discourses very So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly, when he says, that <hi>Universal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, of which we can have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Knowledge, do not concern Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence.</hi>

                  </note> I add, nor our <hi>Notions</hi> neither, of which those Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions do consist, (and much less Propositions that are Uncertain.) For, taking the Notion alone, or according to the direct Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:95549:216"/>
of the Terms, objectively consider'd, they <hi>abstract from</hi> (that is, are indifferent to) all <hi>kinds</hi> of Existence, whether in the Mind or in Nature. But, when he says that such Propositions do not <hi>concern</hi> Existence, he means (I suppose) Existence <hi>in Nature,</hi> or <hi>out of the Mind;</hi> (or else <hi>not at all;)</hi> and the Copula <hi>[est]</hi> must necessarily <hi>signifie</hi> some kind of <hi>Existence,</hi> as well as <hi>Identifie</hi> the two Terms in every Proposition; or otherwise it would be a <hi>Sound</hi> or no <hi>Word.</hi> But this Discourse is perhaps needless, being, as I think, in great part granted here. All I intend by it, is to clear the Notion of Existence in the Title, and that it means Existence <hi>out of the Mind,</hi> by which Things or <hi>Individuums are</hi> in themselves, whether we <hi>think</hi> of them or no. I grant too, that we have so certain a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our <hi>own Existence,</hi> that it <hi>can need no Proof;</hi> but I deny we have it by <hi>Intuition;</hi> and I affirm we <hi>got it,</hi> and <hi>have</hi> it, by plain <hi>Sensation</hi> or <hi>Experience,</hi> in the same manner as we know the Existence of <hi>other Bodies;</hi> as will be shewn, when we come to reflect on the 11th Chapter.</p>

His Demonstration of a Deity, Chap. 10th, is very acute, nor does he here affect Recourse to his <hi>Ideas,</hi> or <note place="margin">To put any Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Brutes is against the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Thing, and Implicatory.</note> build on <hi>them</hi> expressly, or (as he too often does in other places) take <hi>Phantasms</hi> for <hi>Notions;</hi> which takes off the force of his Reasons. Particularly, he argues so strongly that a <hi>Cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Being</hi> can never be made of <hi>meer-Matter,</hi> that I do judge it Unanswerable: And, withall, that it necessarily concludes that Brutes can have no Knowledge, without having something in them that is <hi>Spiritual;</hi> which I am sure he will not
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:95549:217"/>
say. I could wish Mr. <hi>L.</hi> had been steady to this Distinction of those two Natures, of <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Corporeal,</hi> which adequately divide <hi>Ens:</hi> Which, I think he was not, when he said <hi>B.</hi> 4. <hi>Ch.</hi> 3. § 6. that <hi>he sees no contradiction in it that <hi>God</hi> should, if he pleas'd, give to certain Systems of Created Senseless Matter, put together as he thinks fit, some degrees of Sense, Perception and Thought.</hi> For, if the Nature of <hi>meer Matter,</hi> by being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously put together, can bear the having <hi>Thoughtfulness;</hi> it is but compounding it <hi>more arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially,</hi> and it may be as Cogitative as the <hi>Wisest Man</hi> living; and so farewell to all <hi>Spirituality</hi> of our Soul, nay, to all <hi>Spiritual Nature</hi> whatever: For, to what end should <hi>God</hi> create the Distinct Nature of <hi>Spirits,</hi> if Matter wisely orderd could perform all their Operations? If once we yield that <hi>Matter,</hi> conveniently contrived, can be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of <hi>any degree</hi> of Knowledge, it is but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving it <hi>better</hi> and <hi>better,</hi> (and who can stint <hi>Gods</hi> Omnipotency in this, more than in other things?) and it may be capable of the <hi>highest Degree</hi> of Science; and, consequently, to create <hi>Spiritual Nature</hi> at all, would be needless, and to no purpose. Besides, if Men and Brutes differ onely in the <hi>Degrees</hi> of Knowledge, they ought to be of the same <hi>Species;</hi> since <hi>Magis et minus non variant specïem:</hi> For, otherwise, every single Man would make a Distinct <hi>Species,</hi> which is a plain Contradiction. Against this Position of the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of Matters being Cogitative, he argues here very Vigorously § 10. and shows clearly that <hi>Incogitative Matter, and Motion, whatever changes it might produce of Figure and Bulk, could never produce Thought.</hi> He will say that, tho' it
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:95549:217"/>
could not do this <hi>of it self,</hi> yet <hi>God</hi> could make it do it. But if <hi>God</hi> cannot <hi>contradict himself,</hi> or do <hi>Unwisely,</hi> then, since his Creative Wisdom has Establisht each kind of Nature <hi>to be it self</hi> and <hi>no other;</hi> then, to put in <hi>God</hi> a Power to <hi>confound</hi> those Natures again, (which he does if he should confound the Primary and proper Operation of Spirits, which is <hi>Thought, Knowledge</hi> or <hi>Reason</hi> by giving it to Bodies,) is to put a Power in <hi>God</hi> to do <hi>Contradictions,</hi> that is, to do <hi>Impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> for whatever is <hi>against</hi> the <hi>Essence</hi> or Nature of any thing, makes that thing <hi>not to be it self;</hi> which is against an Identical and self evident Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and a <hi>Direct Contradiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Clear Distinction of Corporeal and Spiritual Natures, is of that vast importance; that (tho' it may <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>L.</hi> confound; <hi>Material</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Natures.</note> seem a little unseasonable) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but take this occasion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, once more upon Mr. <hi>L</hi>'s doctrine in this point, apprehending I may not meet with a fitter oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity hereafter. I have reason to think, that he does not exclude Materiality out of the Idea of <hi>Spirit,</hi> or at least of the <hi>Soul,</hi> which all Christian Philosophers and most Heathens too, hold to be of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Nature. On the other side he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> (in some degree at least) to <hi>Brutes.</hi> Now, out of these two po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions it follows demonstratively. 1. That the <hi>Corporeal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Natures are not <hi>clearly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisht,</hi> which utterly destroys all possibility of Truth in Philosophy, and seems to do no small prejudice to Truths of a Higher Concern; which are left Inexplicable to Men of Sense, if those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Truths, which relate to the Clear Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:95549:218"/>
of those two Natures, be violated and render'd Uncertain. For, <hi>Corporeal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Natures, comprizing, or dividing between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, the <hi>Objects</hi> of all the Sciences a Philosopher <hi>can</hi> treat of, whether they be Physicks, Ethicks or Metaphysicks, all which must necessarily build their Discourses, and draw their Conclusions from such Notions as are taken from, and do of right belong to those two Distinct Natures; it follows that, if these two Natures be <hi>confounded</hi> and jumbled together, and be not <hi>clearly Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht,</hi> it is impossible any Clear Conclusion can be drawn from either of them, or any Rational Discourse made concerning them. 2. That Mr. <hi>L</hi>'s way of Philosophizing by <hi>Ideas,</hi> which leads him into such strange Errours, or at least affords him no <hi>certain Light</hi> to Distingush those Natures, is good for nothing at all. For, if it cannot fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him with means, to put a Clear Distinction between Natures so <hi>widely Distant,</hi> and Different from one another; much less can it assist him to show clearly what Modes, Accidents or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties belong to <hi>one</hi> Nature, what to the <hi>other;</hi> or to Distinguish those Natures, which are <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricur</hi> to those two <hi>General</hi> ones; and therefore differ far <hi>less</hi> from one another than <hi>They</hi> did. It remains then to show that Mr. <hi>L</hi>'s Doctrine by way of <hi>Ideas,</hi> does not put a <hi>Clear Distinction</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the aforesaid Natures, but <hi>confounds</hi> them together. He holds it not to be Certain that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiality, is not included in the Notion of our <hi>Spiritual</hi> part the <hi>Soul;</hi> it <hi>may,</hi> therefore, be <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial,</hi> or have <hi>Matter</hi> in it, for any thing his Way of <hi>Ideas</hi> tells him; and therefore since Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot be crampt into an Indivisible, it may
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:95549:218"/>
be <hi>Divisihle</hi> or Extended; and, so, may be <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided</hi> or <hi>Shatter'd,</hi> that is (its Unity being thus lost, and, consequently, its Entity,) it <hi>may cease to bee,</hi> or be <hi>Corrupted.</hi> Again, if it be <hi>Divisible,</hi> it must be <hi>to some degree,</hi> or either <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less,</hi> Divisible; that is, <hi>Rare,</hi> or else <hi>Dense.</hi> If <hi>Rare,</hi> then (since <hi>Passivenes</hi> is Essential to the Notion of <hi>Matter)</hi> it may by the operation of other Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Causes, which never wants, be <hi>Condens'd;</hi> and consequently, become <hi>Opacous</hi> or <hi>Visible;</hi> or, it <hi>may</hi> by the same Causes become <hi>Rarer,</hi> and be turn'd into Fire. Also being <hi>Divisible,</hi> it may have <hi>parts</hi> of which one must be <hi>without</hi> the other, that is, it must be Impenetrable as to its own parts, and thence be able to protrude another Material being, and be <hi>Solid</hi> too (in his Sense of that Word) which is the same with <hi>Impenetrable.</hi> Moreover, since it must be Divisible, it must be Quantitative or Extended, and this not Infinitely but <hi>Finitely;</hi> that is, it must be <hi>Terminated;</hi> wherefore, Termination of Quantity, being the Notion of <hi>Figure,</hi> it may have <hi>Figure</hi> too. In a Word, if it may possibly be <hi>Material,</hi> there is no Property of <hi>Body,</hi> but <hi>may</hi> agree to the Soul; and therefore, the <hi>Soul,</hi> tho' <hi>Spiritual,</hi> may be <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real;</hi> and so the Nature of Body and Spirit may be <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same.</hi> But what needs more than meerly his ascribing <hi>Materiality to it,</hi> at least, permitting it to belong to it? Our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>[Matter]</hi> is taken from Body, and from nothing else, and therefore can be nothing but <hi>Body,</hi> consider'd as (not what it <hi>actually</hi> is, but) as 'tis Alterable, Changeable, or <hi>apt to be another Thing,</hi> that is, as 'tis <hi>Corruptible;</hi> which, I am sure, Mr. <hi>L.</hi> will not say or think of our <hi>Soul.</hi> Perhaps he
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:95549:219"/>
may say, that he only means that it may have Matter <hi>annex'd</hi> to its <hi>Spirituality.</hi> But then he must grant, that since this Materiality did not, as an <hi>Accident,</hi> accrue to the Soul <hi>afterwards,</hi> she had it from <hi>her Nature;</hi> and therefore it must be <hi>Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal</hi> to her, and help to <hi>constitute</hi> her peculiar Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and, if this be so, then, when this Material kind of Compart is dissolv'd or corrupted (for if <hi>Material,</hi> it may be Alter'd, wrought upon, and Corrupted as other Material Compounds may) the Complex or Compound it self is dissolv'd, and so no longer the <hi>same,</hi> but <hi>perish'd.</hi> Besides, what should the Soul do with <hi>two</hi> Material Comparts; one, Organical; the other, Inorganical? Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, since there are as subtil Parts in this Visible Body of ours, with which, as the Form of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, she is <hi>united, (viz.</hi> the <hi>Spirits)</hi> as any, perhaps, Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> can conceive to be annex'd to her.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To proceed, He does but <hi>think it possible,</hi> for any thing he knows, that the Soul may have some Materiality; <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>L</hi>'s Principles confound <hi>Human</hi> and <hi>Brutal</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> but he positively judges, that <hi>Brutes</hi> have <hi>Reason;</hi> nay, that 'tis <hi>as Evident to him as that they have Sense.</hi> Now, if they have <hi>Reason,</hi> they must know how to <hi>draw Consequences,</hi> this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Essential to the Notion of <hi>Reason,</hi> or rather the same Thing in other Words. Again, If they can Reason, they can <hi>compare</hi> what's meant by our <hi>Terms,</hi> and have the Sense of those Sayings we call <hi>Propositions</hi> in their Knowing Power. And, since that Reason is not given them for nothing, but for their Preservation, they can <hi>compare</hi> Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Disagreeable Objects, and <hi>pursue, out of that Reason,</hi> that which is most Agreeable; that
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:95549:219"/>
is, they can <hi>Will, Chuse,</hi> and Act <hi>freely,</hi> which are naturally consequent to their gathering by their Reason what is <hi>better</hi> or <hi>worse</hi> for them, and <hi>thence</hi> Determining themselves to it accordingly: I say, <hi>themselves;</hi> for, if they <hi>have</hi> Reason, then Reason is part of <hi>Themselves,</hi> and not a <hi>Distinct</hi> Thing from them. Out of which Two Things follow: One, That the Nature of <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Brute</hi> are Confounded; since all those Chief Operations Proper to Man, are Communicable to <hi>Brutes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> That Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> will be at a loss to get an <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Spirituality</hi> of his Soul, or of other <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> Beings, by <hi>reflecting</hi> on the <hi>Operations of his Mind;</hi> since the same may possibly be found in such Beings as are <hi>meerly Corporeal.</hi> Wherefore, to conclude this Discourse, all our Natural Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and of all their <hi>Operations,</hi> must be <hi>jumbled together</hi> in a kind of Indifferency to either; and therefore those two Natures must be <hi>Confounded,</hi> if either the <hi>Soul,</hi> which is <hi>Spiritual,</hi> may have <hi>Materiality</hi> Annex'd to <hi>her;</hi> or <hi>Brutes,</hi> which are <hi>material</hi> Entities, may have Thought, Knowledge, and Reason Annex'd to <hi>them.</hi> And since Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> affirms very rationally, that <hi>one of his Ideas is not Another,</hi> I cannot but think he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the more oblig'd to shew out of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of those two <hi>Things,</hi> liquidly and precisely, how those two Natures are distinguish'd; or else his way of <hi>Ideas</hi> will be conceiv'd to be meerly Phantastick and Unphilosophical; being most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the Ideas in the Divine Understanding, the Original Ground of all Truth, which do not <hi>confound</hi> Natures, but <hi>establish</hi> them in a most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Distinction to be what they are, and no other.</hi> I press not here how no Discourse at all in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy

can be <hi>Conclusive,</hi> unless the Nature of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Spirit be perfectly and clearly <hi>contradistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd;</hi> nor repeat what I have shewn, <hi>Reflex.</hi> 9. §. 7. that our Natural Notions teach us to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish perfectly between <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> which his Ideas do not, but <hi>confound</hi> them, and thence <hi>deprave</hi> our Natural Knowledge of Things. I know he <hi>says,</hi> but <hi>proves not,</hi> that the <hi>having Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Ideas,</hi> puts a perfect Difference between Brutes and us; to which I have spoken formerly. I add, that 'tis a thousand times easier to have Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Ideas, they being but <hi>Imperfect Perceptions</hi> of the Thing, than to have <hi>Reason;</hi> as is easie to be demonstrated, and has been manifested above.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As for making <hi>something out of Nothing,</hi> or <hi>Creating;</hi> after we have prov'd that Existence is <hi>Essential</hi> to <hi>God,</hi>

6. I much fear that it may seem something to weaken the true Argument for the Possibility of <hi>Creation,</hi> to <note place="margin">The <hi>Thought</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not move the Body, and <hi>why.</hi>
                  </note> bring the Instance of <hi>our Thought moving our Body;</hi> whence he concludes that Gods <hi>Power</hi> to do a Thing is not to be deny'd <hi>because we cannot comprehend its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> For, 1. Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> thinks he <hi>experiences</hi> this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Soul moves the Body; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we do not experience that <hi>God</hi> Created any thing. 2. As Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> has shown very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniously, that onely the <hi>Man</hi> is <hi>Free:</hi> So I affirm 'tis the <hi>Man</hi> that, wrought upon himself, <hi>moves his Body,</hi> and not his <hi>Thought</hi> onely. And, that, as when we gaind our <hi>First</hi> Notions, the <hi>Man</hi> was acted upon, both according to his Corporeal and Spiritual Part; so, every <hi>New</hi> Act he had <hi>afterwards,</hi> that proceeded from him as he was <hi>Man,</hi> is perform'd by the Concurrence of <hi>both</hi> those Parts. Whence, in every Act of his Soul, he must be re-excited by some Object that is out of the Soul, either striking on his Senses; or else, by the repeated Strokes of the Material Phantasms, lodg'd <hi>within,</hi> upon the Seat of Knowledge. <hi>These</hi> propose a-fresh the Motives, and continue those Impressions all the while he deliberates, compares, discourses, and determins; and, when the <hi>Man,</hi> according to that part call'd the <hi>Fancy,</hi> is <hi>full</hi> (as it were) of those Agreeable Phantasms; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, the <hi>Soul (hic est nunc)</hi> is <hi>full</hi> too of those Notions or Apprehensions of their Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness, the <hi>Whole Man</hi> acts for them, and moves to attain them. In which Case, what is purely <hi>Material</hi> in those Actions, or belonging meerly to Corporeal Motion, is refunded into the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:95549:221"/>
Contrivance of the <hi>Body,</hi> whose Motions follow connaturally from the Phantasms, in the same way as it does in Brutes; which is equally wonderful, <hi>we</hi> knowing no more than <hi>they,</hi> (that is, <hi>not at all) how</hi> it is done: But, the <hi>Manner</hi> of the Action, as to its Design, Direction, wise Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of it, and its Proceeding from Knowledge, Freedom and Reason, (all which we know it does,) springs peculiarly from the <hi>Soul,</hi> or from <hi>Man,</hi> according to his <hi>Spiritual</hi> Part. Now, the Fundamental Ground of my Position is this, <hi>Man</hi> is not <hi>Two</hi> Things; nor (which is the same) made up of Soul and Body, as two <hi>Actual Parts;</hi> but <hi>One</hi> Thing, of which, consequently, those two are <hi>Potential Parts</hi> onely. Wherefore, neither of those Parts is <hi>Actually,</hi> but the <hi>Whole;</hi> and therefore, neither of them <hi>alone</hi> can <hi>Act,</hi> because neither of them <hi>exists alone;</hi> * the Existence of the Thing being that in which <note place="margin">

But, in truth, his Argument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds as well from <hi>this</hi> Topick, as it does from <hi>that</hi> of meer <hi>Thought</hi> moving the Body; for, we can comprehend as little, how <hi>Man,</hi> tho' acting with his Phantasms and Thoughts too, does move the Body, and all its Distinct Parts, so variously, as how the <hi>Thought alone</hi> can do it. Nor, were there some Flaw in this Particular, does it preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice his main Demonstration of a Deity, they being Distinct Questions. Add, that if we may conjecture from some Expressions of his in other places, he may perhaps be of my Opinion in this Point, and, by the Word <hi>[Mind,]</hi> mean the <hi>Man;</hi> tho' in many places he speaks very Ambiguously; or rather, seems too plainly to maintain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Position.</p>

7. I take leave on this Occasion, to recommend it to Speculative Men, to endeavour to draw all their Demonstrations <note place="margin">The Notion or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Deity</hi> being once settled to be <hi>Self-exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> all that can be said of it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</note> from <hi>the Nature of the Thing,</hi> (this being the onely solid way,) and not from <hi>Foreign</hi> Topicks. After we have prov'd a Deity, let us next demonstrate that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Self-existent;</hi> or, that his Essence, or Nature, is <hi>Existence;</hi> and then, all that concerns the Deity, or his Immediate Operations, nay, even the Rational Explication of the <hi>Trinity</hi> it self, will (if Right Logick and Reflexion be not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) follow more solidly, and more clearly, than the clearest Mathematical Conclusions; if we rate Clearness and Evidence, (as we ought,) not from the Figures on Paper, which make it easie to our Fancy; but from the greater Simplicity and Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Notions, and their Terms, and of their equally-evident Connexion; which, coming near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to First, and Self-evident Principles, do most firmly establish the Judgment.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The 11th Chapter treats <hi>Of our Knowledge of the Existence of other Things;</hi> by which words he means, <hi>other Things</hi>

                  <hi>than our selves.</hi> He seems to ground his Discourse on this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that <hi>no particular Man can know the Existence of any other Being, but only when, by Actually operating upon him, it makes it self per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by him;</hi> which he calls the Way of <hi>Sensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or Experience. Now, if, by the Words, <hi>[any other Being,]</hi> he means <hi>Bodies,</hi> nothing can be more Solid, or worthy a Philosopher.

of <hi>Spiritual Beings,</hi> or Angels, (tho' they do not operate upon <hi>us</hi> actually,) from some Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on <hi>other</hi> Things in Nature that can <hi>onely</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from <hi>them,</hi> I cannot discern: Rather, I hope I have demonstrated we can, in my <hi>Method, Book</hi> 3. <hi>Less.</hi> 6. <hi>Thesis</hi> 4. Indeed, the Notions of Angelical Natures are not <hi>proper</hi> ones, as our <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Notions, which are imprinted by Sensation, are; which makes our Conceptions, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the Words which we use when we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of them <hi>Metaphorical.</hi> Nor matters it, that our Expressions concerning them are oft-times <hi>Negative,</hi> or signifie that they <hi>are not</hi> such Beings as Bodies are, but <hi>Immaterial, Unextended, Indivisible,</hi> and, consequently, their Operations <hi>Unsuccessive;</hi> in regard we <hi>intend</hi> all the while to signifie by those Words, a <hi>Positive Being,</hi> tho' our low Natural Conceptions cannot reach its parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Nature, as in it self: And, if we <hi>intend</hi> this, then <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>meaning</hi> of those Words, or our <hi>Notion</hi> of them; <hi>Meaning</hi> and <hi>Intention</hi> being all one. Yet, these Predicates, tho' Negative, or Metaphorical, are, notwithstanding, <hi>truly</hi> said of them; and, therefore, we can Argue and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course as consequently from <hi>them,</hi> as we can from the most <hi>Positive</hi> or <hi>Proper</hi> Notions we have. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> says well, §. 12. we cannot know they exist, by <hi>the Ideas</hi> we <hi>have of them in our Minds;</hi> and the Reason is, because those <hi>Ideas,</hi> or Notions, taking them as <hi>

                  <pb n="401" facs="tcp:95549:222"/>
But he is much mistaken if he thinks we can no more know they are <hi>Capable</hi> of <hi>Existing</hi> by the Notions we have of them, than we can that <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taurs</hi> are: For, the Idea or Fancy of Centaurs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves <hi>Inconsistent</hi> Notions in its very <hi>Nature,</hi> (or rather, <hi>No-Nature;)</hi> which the Notion of a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent Spirit,</hi> called an <hi>Angel,</hi> does not.

               <p n="9">9.

10. The 12th Chapter treats of <hi>the Improvement of our Knowledge,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> says, <hi>does not depend on Maxims.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">No Improvement of <hi>Science,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fome General Principle.</note> But, First, he mistakes the Use of General <hi>Maxims:</hi> They are not made for the Vulgar, or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners, to <hi>gather</hi> Knowledge by them; tho' it may be observ'd, that Men of all sorts do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally use them when they <hi>sute</hi> their purpose; nay, sometimes make Proverbs of them. Nor was this Maxim, <hi>[a Whole is bigger than a Part,]</hi> ever intended for Boys, or to teach them that <hi>their Hand is bigger than their Little Finger,</hi> or such like; but, being premised to the ensuing Proofs, they are <hi>occasionally</hi> made use of by Learned Men, in the Process of their Discourse, to <hi>clinch</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Point, when it needs it, by their <hi>Self-Evidence.</hi> In the same manner as my self have very frequently had recourse to Metaphysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Principles, and made use of them, in my Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminaries and Reflexions, as Occasion presented, to make my Discourses Evident; and, to <hi>rivet</hi> the Truths I advance, in the Minds of my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; as any Attentive Peruser of them may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observe. He speaks against our <hi>Receiving Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples without Examination,</hi> and of Principles that <hi>are not Certain;</hi> that is, against such Sayings, as are <hi>no Principles;</hi> for, <hi>if</hi> they can either <hi>need,</hi> or <hi>admit</hi> of Examination, or, <hi>if they be not Certain,</hi> none but meer Fops will let them <hi>pass for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> Yet, tho' Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> does thus oppose Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims and Principles, 'tis, notwithstanding, very evident, that himself must make use of some Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims and Principles all the while he disputes aganst their Usefulness; otherwise, he cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:95549:224"/>
at all; or, his Discourse can have no <hi>Force:</hi> In the same manner as he that wrastles with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, must either <hi>fix</hi> his <hi>Foot</hi> on some <hi>Firm Ground,</hi> or he will fall himself, instead of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing his Adversary. Let us then examin <hi>his</hi> Principles. He alledges, that <hi>the Knowledge of the Certainty of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples examin'd.</note> 
                  <hi>depends only upon the Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Agreement or Disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Ideas.</hi> This, then, is one of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; both because it runs through good part of his 3d and 4th Books, as also because 'tis Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to this Universal, <hi>[All Certainty of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples depends,</hi> &amp;c.] Now, this is so far from <hi>Self-evident,</hi> that it <hi>needs Examination</hi> enough; and is one of those I judge <hi>not Certain;</hi> and, therefore, can be <hi>no</hi> Ground or Principle <hi>at all:</hi> Nor is it possible it should, unless the Word <hi>[Idea]</hi> be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to mean <hi>Spiritual Notions</hi> in our <hi>Mind,</hi> and not meer <hi>Resemblances,</hi> or <hi>Material Representations</hi> in our <hi>Fancy;</hi> to clear which, (tho' the whole Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise needs it,) no Provision is made; but, on the contrary, those two vastly different things are rather carelesly confounded; as is shewn in my First Preliminary. Another Principle seems to be this, <hi>[None ought, with a Blind and Implicit Faith, to Receive and Swallow Principles.]</hi> This is of <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Influence,</hi> and <hi>Self-Evident;</hi> and, therefore, in all Points well qualify'd for a <hi>Principle.</hi> For, Principles were not Principles, if they needed ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Deductions</hi> of Reason, to make them go down, since they ought to be Evident by their <hi>own</hi> Light. But, what Good can this do to any, but to such as have renounc'd Common Sense, even to Ridiculousness? And, perhaps Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:95549:224"/>
had some such weak Writers in his Eye, when he advanc'd this cautious Position, as a Warning to Learners.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Now, the General Maxims and Principles, on which the Learned Part of the World has hitherto proceeded, <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s main Principle; which is to ascertain all other Principles, <hi>Inevident.</hi>
                  </note> can onely be overthrown (if they must needs be so) by other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>more Evident</hi> than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are; or else it will be but a drawn Match; and so they may hope still to stand (as the Lawyers phrase it) <hi>in their full Force, Effect, and Vertue.</hi> We are to consider then, what Principle Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> has substituted in their room, when they are discarded; for, 'tis a very ill Case to be left without any Principles at all. 'Tis this, <hi>[All Knowledge of the Certainty of Principles,</hi> and consequently, the <hi>Way to improve our Knowledge, is, to get, and fix in our Minds, Clear, Distinct and Compleat Ideas, as far as they are to be had, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex to them Proper and Constant Names.]</hi> Now, if the Ideas must be <hi>Clear,</hi> the Terms must be very <hi>Simple,</hi> and consequently (as was shewn above) <hi>General</hi> ones; and this will force us back upon <hi>General Maxims,</hi> which it was intended we should avoid, as <hi>good for little.</hi> To be <hi>Distinct,</hi> if we go to work like Artists, we must distinguish those Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and Common Notions; which will bring us back into the old Road of those Ten Common Heads, called <hi>Predicaments;</hi> and, consequently, of <hi>Genus, Species</hi> and <hi>Differences,</hi> which was lately dislik'd; I suppose, because it was too much tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd in, and beaten; tho', I think, such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Path should not be left, because some may have here and there laid a Block or Briar in the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:95549:225"/>
way. Lastly, <hi>Compleat Ideas</hi> (as he grants) are not to be had of the <hi>Species,</hi> much less of the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduums.</hi> And, as for <hi>Names;</hi> 'tis not <hi>we</hi> that are to <hi>annex</hi> them, but the Common Usage of the Vulgar, or of the Generality of Learned Men, (in case they be Artificial ones;) for, these are they who gave them their <hi>Constant</hi> and <hi>Proper</hi> Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Whence is seen, that so many Difficulties are involv'd in this one <hi>Thesis,</hi> or <hi>Principle,</hi> (besides what is said above, of the Word <hi>[Ideas,])</hi> that we can build no Degree of <hi>Certainty,</hi> nor <hi>Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of Knowledge upon it; especially, since Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> himself (according to his usual <hi>Candour</hi> and <hi>Modesty)</hi> declares here, he does but <hi>think</hi> it true. But, which is the hardest Case of all, to embrace this Principle, we must be oblig'd to quit all our <hi>Self-evident Maxims,</hi> as of <hi>little Use,</hi> upon which our selves, and all the Learned part of the World, have proceeded hitherto.</p>
               <p n="12">12. 'Tis a great Truth, that <hi>it is a right Method of advancing Knowledge, to Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Abstract Notions:</hi> But, if <note place="margin">What Things hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Science.</note> these be not the <hi>Things,</hi> nor (as Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s <hi>Complex Ideas</hi> are) so much as <hi>like them,</hi> I see not but that, let us <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider</hi> them as much as we will, we shall be never the nearer attaining any <hi>Real Knowledge</hi> by such a Consideration. I add, that it is also as necessary to find out <hi>Middle Terms,</hi> that are <hi>Proper;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, no Science can be had of any <hi>New</hi> Conclusion; nor, consequently, can we, without this, advance one Step in Exact Knowledge.

bold, as openly to profess it. The Current of Slight Speculaters having long endeavour'd to make it pass for a kind of Maxim, that <hi>[there is no perfect Certainty to be had, but only in Lines and Numbers:]</hi> Whereas, the Principles of Morality are as <hi>Evident,</hi> and the Notions belonging to such Subjects as <hi>Clear,</hi> as those in Natural Philosophy, perhaps Clearer; as this worthy Author has shewn most manifestly. 'Tis also True, that <hi>Knowledge may be better'd by Experience.</hi> But, if he means <hi>Scientifical</hi> Knowledge, which is the Effect of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,</hi> I must deny it, unless Common Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Nature do guide Experience, and give it Light of the True and Proper Causes of what Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience inform'd our Senses; for, without their Assistance, (as I have shewn in the Preface to my my <hi>Method,)</hi> Experimental Knowledge can never produce any one <hi>Scientifical Conclusion.</hi> I add, that True Science would be a Thousand times more advanc'd, did Learned Men bend their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to begin with the <hi>Primary</hi> Affections of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and thence proceed gradually to <hi>Secondary,</hi> or <hi>more Compounded</hi> ones: For, this Method would furnish Studious Men with good Store of <hi>Proper Middle Terms,</hi> to deduce their Demonstrations. Lastly, 'Tis true, that <hi>we must beware of Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and <hi>Wrong Principles:</hi> But, where shall we find any Sect. of Philosophers, who, for want of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Skill in Logick and Metaphysicks, are not forc'd to build upon <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> (and those gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally False ones too;) but our <hi>Anti-Ideists,</hi> whom I take to be true Followers of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in his main Principles, and the only true Understanders of his Doctrine.

Again, there are two sorts of Objects Man, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving two Natures in him, may be employ'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, <hi>viz. Outward Action</hi> and <hi>Inward Assent.</hi> The former does (generally) concern the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Conveniences or Necessities of our Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Life here; the Later, the Interiour and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Perfection of our Soul; which is the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to <hi>Truth,</hi> and rejecting of <hi>Errour.</hi> In the Former of these we can have <hi>no</hi> Clear Evidence, or very seldom; both because <hi>Outward Actions</hi> are employ'd about <hi>Particulars,</hi> of which we can have <hi>no Science;</hi> as also, because those Particulars about which we are to <hi>Act,</hi> are surrounded with almost Innumerable Circumstances which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Comprehend, and way-laid by the Undisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable Ambushes of Fortune; so that we can sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never, with absolute Certainty, <hi>know</hi> whether they may, or may not prove <hi>Successful.</hi> Notwithstanding which Dangers, when there is Necessity or great Conveniency to Act <hi>Outwardly,</hi> we may, without disparaging our Reason, fall to acting upon a <hi>Probability;</hi> the Necessity <hi>obliging</hi> us to do so, and the Impossibility of <hi>perfect As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance</hi> acquitting us of Imprudence. But, of <hi>Assenting,</hi> or of <hi>Judging Inwardly,</hi> that a Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is <hi>True</hi> or <hi>False,</hi> there can be <hi>no Necessity,</hi> unless <hi>Evidence</hi> forces us to it; in regard <hi>God's</hi> Goodness has furnish'd us with a Faculty of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spending</hi> our Judgment in such Cases, lest we run into Errour; which is always prejudicial to our Nature; and, if the Errour does concern matters of high Moment, pernicious to our Souls Eternal Welfare. This I take to be <hi>plain Reason,</hi> nor do I doubt but that each Branch of this Discourse may be reduced to perfect Evidence. We come to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:95549:227"/>
now what Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> delivers in this most important Point.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>First,</hi> He Confounds <hi>Outward Action,</hi> of which there <hi>is Necessity,</hi> and <hi>can be no Evidence</hi> of Success; with <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>L. confounds Outward Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> to which we <hi>may</hi> proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Probability, with <hi>Inward As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> to which we <hi>may not.</hi>
                  </note> Interiour <hi>Judging</hi> and <hi>Assenting,</hi> of which there <hi>can be no Necessity,</hi> if there can be no Evidence; and of which <hi>Evident</hi> Knowledge <hi>may</hi> oftentimes <hi>be had;</hi> as also concerning whose Truth or Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, till Evidence appear, we may safely and honourably <hi>suspend</hi> our Judgment; nay, if, in such a case, we do <hi>not,</hi> we hazard to do our selves an Injury when we <hi>need not.</hi> That he thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds those two vastly <hi>Different,</hi> or rather <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> Considerations, appears hence; that, § 1. he shews the Unreasonableness of <hi>not eating,</hi> and of <hi>not going about our Business, till we have a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration that the Meat will nourish us,</hi> and the <hi>Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will succeed;</hi> which Instances evidently relate to <hi>Outward Action;</hi> but in § 3. he speaks in the same Tenour of <hi>taking the Proposition to be True or False;</hi> which clearly relates to <hi>Inward Assent. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>God</hi>
                  </hi>'s Wisdom has indeed given us, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, no more but <hi>Probability</hi> for our Outward Actions doing <hi>us good,</hi> or <hi>succeeding;</hi> but to think our all-wise Maker has given us no better Grounds to make us <hi>Assent;</hi> or rather, that he intended we should <hi>Assent</hi> upon Probabilities, which are still liable to be <hi>False;</hi> and, if they be <hi>but</hi> Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, <hi>may all be False,</hi> is to think that God meant to expose our Souls to innumerable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; nay, allows and designs we should em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Errours. For, if (as Mr. <hi>L.</hi> says) <hi>God <hi>has</hi>
                     <pb n="412" facs="tcp:95549:228"/>
given as a Faculty</hi> to judge that to be <hi>True,</hi> which, the Reasons for their Truth being <hi>but Probable, may not be True;</hi> then, since <hi>God</hi> has most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly intended we should make use of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty he has given us, it must follow that <hi>God</hi> has <hi>exposed</hi> us to <hi>Errour,</hi> or <hi>design'd</hi> we should <hi>err;</hi> and that, (this Faculty, as he says, not being <hi>Knowledge) very frequently.</hi> Which is hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Reverence we do both of us owe to our Creatour, who governs his Creatures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature he has given them; which, is to <hi>avoid Errour,</hi> and never (as will shortly be seen this does) to admit a Contradiction.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What therefore I extremely admire, is, that Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> should say in express Terms, that <hi>Judgment is that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A strange Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of our <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Faculty.</note> 
                  <hi>whereby the Mind takes any Proposition to be True or False, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perceiving a Demonstrative Evidence in the Proofs;</hi> and that this <hi>Faculty is given Man by God to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten him.</hi> For, <hi>First, Judgment</hi> does not <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten</hi> us at all; as appears evidently, because <hi>False</hi> Judgments are <hi>Errours;</hi> which are so far from <hi>enlightning</hi> the Mind, that they manifestly <hi>darken it.</hi> All that <hi>Judgment</hi> does, is to <hi>Fix</hi> the Mind in the Perswasion it has, whether that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion springs from <hi>Clear Reason</hi> or <hi>Dark Passion;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> seems to make good my Words, while he contradistinguishes <hi>Judgment</hi> to <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi> which later, and <hi>onely</hi> which, is our <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual <hi>Light.</hi> Secondly,</hi> The Words <hi>[Taking</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions to be <hi>True</hi> or <hi>False]</hi> must mean <hi>Assenting</hi> to them as such; for every <hi>Judgment</hi> is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an <hi>Assent,</hi> but a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>firm</hi> Assent. Now, that no <hi>Probability</hi> can, with Reason, cause <hi>Assent,</hi>
                  <pb n="413" facs="tcp:95549:228"/>
(and certainly <hi>God,</hi> who <hi>gave</hi> us our Reason, has not given us a Faculty to use it <hi>against our Reason)</hi> will be seen hereafter. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Which is yet worse, by contradistinguishing <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Clear Knowledge,</hi> he makes those Assents which spring out of Clear Knowledge to be <hi>no Judgments at all;</hi> whereas These are the <hi>onely</hi> Judgments that we can be sure will do us good, and are according to our True Nature, <hi>Reason.</hi> He tells us indeed, in the Close, that when we judge <hi>as things really are,</hi> they are <hi>Right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> But, how does this agree with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinguishing formerly <hi>[Judgment,]</hi> according to its whole Latitude, or in its General Notion, from <hi>Knowledge;</hi> unless we should say, that we only do right when we judge at Hap-hazard, or judge Right <hi>by Chance. Qui quod aequum est sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit parte inauditâ alterâ, Aequum licet statuerit, haud aequus est tamen:</hi> By which Rule, we are <hi>ill Men,</hi> even tho' we <hi>Judge right;</hi> because we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate and <hi>hazard</hi> to embrace <hi>Errour</hi> when we <hi>need not.</hi> Besides, <hi>Things are so really to us as we know them to be:</hi> And, if we do <hi>not know</hi> them to be such, we cannot with Reason <hi>say</hi> or <hi>judge</hi> them to be such; and, if we <hi>do,</hi> we act <hi>against</hi> our true <hi>Nature;</hi> to do which <hi>God</hi> has given us <hi>no Faculty. Fourthly,</hi> Amongst the Causes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd here that make us judge, <hi>Necessity</hi> is reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd as <hi>one, when Certain Knowledge is not to be had:</hi> But, this can be <hi>no</hi> Cause at all to make us <hi>Judge.</hi> For, there can be <hi>no</hi> possible Necessity, <hi>forcing</hi> us to judge, but <hi>Clear Evidence.</hi> This, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>obliges</hi> us to Interiour Assent, and <hi>compels</hi> us to judge that the Thing is so as we <hi>see</hi> it to be. But, if no Evidence can be had, what <hi>Necessity</hi> is
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:95549:229"/>
there at all of Judging one way or other? Cannot we <hi>suspend</hi> our Judgment till Evidence appears; or whether it does ever appear, or not? Why are we in such hast to hazard falling into Error? Or who bids us Judge <hi>at all</hi> till we see a good (or Conclusive) Reason why? I am sure, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever many Men may do out of <hi>Weakness,</hi> neither <hi>God</hi> nor <hi>Nature</hi> ever impos'd upon any such an absurd Duty. <hi>Lastly,</hi> What means his making it <hi>then</hi> to be <hi>Judgment,</hi> when we have no <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative Evidence?</hi> May we not <hi>judge</hi> a Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is <hi>Demonstrated</hi> to be <hi>True,</hi> because it is <hi>Demonstrated?</hi> Or that an Identical Proposition is <hi>True,</hi> because 'tis <hi>Self-evident?</hi> Or, rather, <hi>ought</hi> we not to <hi>judge</hi> all such Propositions to be True for this very Reason, because we <hi>know evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently</hi> they <hi>are so.</hi> So far then is <hi>Certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> from being <hi>contradistinguish'd</hi> from <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that they are in some manner <hi>the same,</hi> as I have shewn in my METHOD, <hi>B.</hi> 2. <hi>Less.</hi> 1. § 3. where, I hope, I have set the Nature of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in a Clear Light; as I have that of <hi>Assent, Suspense,</hi> and <hi>Certainty, B.</hi> 3. § 9.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I should be glad to think my self mistaken in Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Meaning, if his Express Words, the Tenour of <note place="margin">That God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided due Motives of <hi>Enjoin'd As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, if they be not wanting to themselves.</note> his Discourse, and his next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>[Of Probability,]</hi> which runs in the same Strain, would give me leave. Perhaps, he thinks that, since none can embrace Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity without judging it to be <hi>True,</hi> and few <hi>know</hi> it to be so, we should exclude the Generality from the way to Salvation, if we do not allow such a Faculty given us by <hi>God,</hi> as
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:95549:229"/>
                  <hi>Judging</hi> without <hi>Knowing.</hi> I Answer, 1. Those Gifts that come <hi>from Above, from the Father of Lights,</hi> are all <hi>Perfect,</hi> as being the Endowments of his Infinitely-bountiful Hand; and, that Men act <hi>imperfectly</hi> and <hi>foolishly,</hi> springs from the <hi>Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedness</hi> of Creatures. Scarce a Faculty they have but has its Weakness when we come to act, as well as our Reason. When then any one is reduc'd to Christianity upon <hi>weak</hi> Motives, what's <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Sincere</hi> in that Action is refunded into <hi>God</hi> the Author of all Good; what's <hi>Defective</hi> (as all <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conclusive</hi> Reasonings are) is to be refunded into the <hi>Imperfection of Creatures.</hi> Indeed, it belongs to <hi>God</hi> to lay and establish such Motives to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace High and Concerning Truths, as are <hi>of their own Nature</hi> apt to convince, not only People of all sorts, but even the most Speculative Wit living; but it does not belong to him to provide, that every <hi>weak</hi> Man shall, <hi>untaught,</hi> penetrate them <hi>throughly;</hi> nor every <hi>Careless</hi> Man make use of them. Rude and Imperfect Motives are sufficient to move Rude and Imperfect Understandings. 2. This notwithstanding, <hi>God</hi> has furnish'd even the Rudest, who cannot <hi>Speculate</hi> at all, with a Power to understand such Motives, <hi>after some Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,</hi> called <hi>Practical Evidence;</hi> which teaches them, by a common Converse with Natural Things, and with Mankind, to know (dully at least) the Force of Witnessing Authority attesting the Miracles that abetted Christianity, and the Books that deliver'd it. But, what I chiefly insist upon is, that it teaches all Men, that the Nature of its <hi>Precepts,</hi> and of its <hi>Morality,</hi> is most Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our Reason; that it <hi>curbs Passion,</hi> which breeds such Turmoils in the World; and that, (if
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:95549:230"/>
settled in Men's Lives,) it would establish all the World in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Concord;</hi> especially, since they cannot but see what Inconveniencies and ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences do ensue the Breach of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And this gives an <hi>Entire Satisfaction</hi> to every Man who is capable of Knowing Common Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, (as, who is not?) and <hi>assures</hi> them, that the Doctrine it self is <hi>True;</hi> since they experience that Errour puts all into <hi>Confusion</hi> and <hi>Disorder.</hi> But, this on the By. In a Word, He must be a mean Speculater, who does not observe that <hi>God</hi> has laid Motives, and Solid Knowable ones too, for every Man to embrace <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> of what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree soever he be, if he be but so wise as to <hi>doubt,</hi> and <hi>require</hi> a Reason: If those Motives be not <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd</hi> to <hi>all,</hi> 'tis either the Fault of those that do not <hi>care</hi> to be instructed; or of those who <hi>should</hi> inculcate and <hi>explicate</hi> to them those Motives, and <hi>shew</hi> how Solid and Clear they are. Let <hi>them</hi> then bear the Blame; <hi>God</hi>'s Providence is justify'd, and his Wisdom and Goodness magnify'd, by his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ample Provision for such Negligent and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Persons.

when clearly <hi>Repugnant,</hi> it breeds <hi>Dissent.</hi> I am therefore onely to reflect on those Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> that seem to say we may <hi>assent,</hi> or <hi>judge</hi> the Thing <hi>is so</hi> upon <hi>Probable Reasons;</hi> or, as Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> expresses it, <hi>assent as firmly</hi> as <hi>tho' the Thing were infallibly demonstrated, tho' it do but bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der near upon Certainty.</hi> I have shewn in my <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, Book</hi> 3. <hi>Less.</hi> 9. §. 12. that no truly Wise Man does Assent or Judge upon Motives, tho' ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>highly Probable;</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> do so, tho' they be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so <hi>Probable</hi> and <hi>Likely,</hi> if he <hi>sees</hi> it <hi>but</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or <hi>Probable:</hi> For, all Reasons or Motives that are <hi>but Probable,</hi> permit that the Thing <hi>may not be so,</hi> or <hi>may not be;</hi> and to <hi>assent,</hi> or <hi>judge</hi> the Thing <hi>True,</hi> is to say in our Mind, that the Thing <hi>is:</hi> Whence, to Assent the Thing <hi>is,</hi> upon a Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is, equivalently, to hold, that, <hi>it is possible the Thing may be, and may not be, at once: It may be,</hi> because <hi>it is;</hi> and, <hi>it may not be</hi> at the same time, because the onely Grounds for its <hi>Being</hi> so, are <hi>but Probable.</hi> Which, therefore, being against a <hi>First,</hi> and <hi>Self-evident</hi> Principle, is the greatest Deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that a Humane Understanding can be liable to, and (if put in clear Terms) absolutely <hi>Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;</hi> both because Contradictions being repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Nature of <hi>Ens,</hi> or <hi>Thing,</hi> are <hi>Unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible;</hi> as also, because it would make our Mind, which is Essentially <hi>Intellectual,</hi> to be not <hi>Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual,</hi> that is, Chimerical.

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. This Ground laid, 'tis obvious to discern what is to be said to his 16th Chapter, <hi>[Of the Degrees of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.]</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">There cannot be, in proper Speech, any <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</hi>

                  <hi>is so,</hi> can be built upon the Sandy Foundation of Probability, without a most prodigious Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Humane Understanding. 2. Hence I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the very Subject or <hi>Title</hi> of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and I object against it, that it is an <hi>Absolute Impossibility</hi> there should be, in proper Speech, any <hi>Degrees of Assent.</hi> To <hi>Assent</hi> to any Truth, (as was lately shewn,) is to say interiourly, the Thing <hi>[is;]</hi> and to <hi>Dissent,</hi> is to say the Thing <hi>[is not.]</hi> These two Notions then are evidently the <hi>Objects</hi> of those two <hi>Acts,</hi> which give those Acts to <hi>be what they are,</hi> or (as the Schools express it) do specifie them. Wherefore, each of those two Acts consists in an <hi>Indivisible,</hi> as their <hi>Objects</hi> do; and, consequently, there can be no more any <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>Assent,</hi> than there can be any Middle between <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>is not;</hi> which is neither the one nor the other; or, in <hi>part</hi> the one, in <hi>part</hi> the other; whereas, being both of them Indivisible, <hi>neither</hi> of them can have any <hi>Parts at all.</hi> The Degrees then which can possibly be put in this case, and which I would be willing to think Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> meant, are the Degrees of <hi>Bending</hi> or <hi>Inclining,</hi> more or less, <hi>towards</hi> Assent or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; that is, Greater or Lesser <hi>Opinions</hi> of the Things <hi>Being,</hi> or not <hi>Being. Assent</hi> then, and <hi>Dissent,</hi> or <hi>is</hi> and <hi>is not,</hi> in the Judging Power, are the two fixed Butts and Bounds of that large Field, in which Innumerable Swarms of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, Probabilities, Likelihoods, Doubts, Deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Uncertainties reside; driven perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually up and down, in a Wild-Goose Chase, by those Unsteady Guides, <hi>Probabilities;</hi> now nearer, now farther off from those Immoveable Barriers.

of <hi>Probability</hi> and <hi>Likelihood</hi> may sometimes be so very great, that they may seem, even to the wisest Men, while they regard them <hi>heedlesly,</hi> to counterfeit Assent, till they come to take a narrower and stricter Re-view of the Grounds on which they are built; as I have shewn in my <hi>Method, Book</hi> 3. <hi>Less.</hi> 9. §. 2. Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates here many <hi>Probable</hi> Topicks, grounding <hi>Opinion;</hi> and I have done the same, in the place now quoted, §. 10. All which do agree in this, that they are <hi>Common</hi> or <hi>Remote Mediums:</hi> Whence they are, in true Reason, <hi>Inconclusive;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, utterly unable to cause Assent in a Being that is <hi>Rational;</hi> there wanting in them that <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and Certain Connexion,</hi> in which all the Force of <hi>Consequence</hi> consists, and which Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> puts to be onely known by <hi>Intuition.</hi> There may, indeed, be Degrees of Assent taken from the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>'s side, by which the Understanding Assents <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less firmly;</hi> according as the <hi>Medium</hi> is <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> Evident. Whence, <hi>Metaphysical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums,</hi> which approach nearest to <hi>Self-Evidence,</hi> cause a <hi>firmer</hi> Assent, than those which are taken from <hi>Inferiour</hi> Notions, which depend on the <hi>other</hi> for their Certainty: And, that <hi>Medium</hi> taken from the <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> does rationally beget the <hi>Firmest</hi> Assent of <hi>all:</hi> Yet, still, the Object of the Assent or Dissent is <hi>[is,]</hi> or <hi>[is not.]</hi> But this cannot be Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s meaning here; because the least of these Assents is built upon <hi>Clear Evidence;</hi> which is impossible to be found, where the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> is <hi>but Probable.</hi>

One of whom, a Worthy Friend of mine, of an acute Understanding, and very Ingenious, but not yet wean'd from insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant School-Terms, nor aware of their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling way of <hi>Distinguishing;</hi> uponmy discoursing with him about this point, did imagin it might all be answered, and over thrown by an easy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of <hi>Assent,</hi> into <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Probable.</hi> Alledging that <hi>Absolute Assent</hi> had indeed <hi>[is]</hi> for its Object, and so consisted in an Indivisible; but that <hi>Probable</hi> Assent did <hi>not so;</hi> by which means the imputation of holding a Contradiction is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded. Thus he reply'd: Wherefore, it were not amiss for his sake, and others of the same pitch, to lay open the frivolousness of this insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant <hi>Distinction;</hi> that, by reflecting on this, they may correct their carriage in all other like occasions. First then, he seems to join the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet of <hi>[Probable]</hi> to the <hi>Act</hi> of Assenting; which is perfect Nonsense. For, since every <hi>Accident</hi> or Mode has its Metaphysical Verity, by <hi>which it is what it is,</hi> as well as any <hi>Substance;</hi> it is equally against the First Principle <hi>[Every Thing is what it is]</hi> to apply that Distinction to any <hi>Accident</hi> (of
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:95549:232"/>
which <hi>Assent</hi> is one,) as it would be to apply it to any <hi>Substance.</hi> Put case then we were discours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning the Nature of a <hi>Stone,</hi> or of any other Substance or Body; and were disputing whether its nature were <hi>such</hi> or <hi>such;</hi> and he should go about to elude the whole force of this Discourse, by Distinguishing <hi>[Stone]</hi> into a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Stone,</hi> and an <hi>Absolute Stone,</hi> would it not be highly ridiculous: For the same Reason it would be <hi>equally</hi> Ridiculous to apply <hi>[Probable]</hi> to the <hi>Act</hi> of Assenting; since that <hi>Act</hi> is as <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely</hi> it self, as a Stone is a Stone, or any other Body <hi>is what it is.</hi> But, that I may not be too severe, let us imagin he meant to apply <hi>[Probable,]</hi> to the <hi>Object</hi> of the Act or some Proposition, as standing under <hi>Motives</hi> onely Probable; whence, 'tis equivalent to this Proposition, <hi>[This Tenet is Probable:]</hi> Then, in case the Proof of that Tenet were onely a <hi>Probable Medium,</hi> that Proposition is a <hi>plain Truth,</hi> for what is inferr'd by a <hi>Probable Medium,</hi> is beyond all question, <hi>Probable;</hi> and therefore the Assent to that Proposition, ought to be call'd <hi>Absolute,</hi> and not <hi>Probable,</hi> which quite spoiles the Distinction by making the <hi>two</hi> branches of it to be <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same.</hi> 3. Hence, this Contradistinguishing <hi>Probable</hi> and <hi>Absolute,</hi> is faulty in another regard, because the two parts of it are <hi>not (some way) Opposit;</hi> as they ought to be; because the Defendent in the Schools uses to say, that according to <hi>one</hi> of them, he <hi>grants</hi> the Proposition, and according to the other <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> it. Now, <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Probable,</hi> are not at all <hi>proper Opposites: [Absolute]</hi> signifies <hi>Consummate</hi> or <hi>Perfect</hi> in its kind, and relates to the Minds <hi>perfectly yeilding</hi> or assenting that the Thing is
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:95549:233"/>
                  <hi>True;</hi> whereas, <hi>[Probable]</hi> must relate to the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> or the <hi>common Medium</hi> under which the Proposition stands, or else (as was lately shewn) it is meer Nonsense, and Ridiculous. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Opposite to <hi>Probable,</hi> is <hi>Improbable;</hi> and, what has <hi>Improbable</hi> to do with <hi>Absolute?</hi> Lastly, granting he speaks of the Object or <hi>Thesis</hi> proposed to our Assent, it will appear evidently that my Assertion will stand good, and that the <hi>Formal Object</hi> of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is what is express'd by the Copula <hi>[is,]</hi> or the Connexion of the two Terms, in which <hi>Truth</hi> (which onely is to be <hi>assented</hi> to) consists. For example; When we say that <hi>[A Thesis prov'd one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a Common Medium, is Probable;]</hi> the Truth, even of <hi>this</hi> Proposition, is onely express'd by the Copula <hi>[is,]</hi> and consists in an Indivisible; so that you no sooner step out of <hi>[is Probable,]</hi> but you must run into its Contradictory, <hi>[is not Probable.]</hi>

This Instance will give us occasion to note the Vanity and Folly of Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Distinctions, which pass current <note place="margin">What kinds of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions</hi> are Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowable in Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</note> amongst Disputants; in which, if examin'd strictly, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the two parts of them are not <hi>Opposit,</hi> but onely oddly <hi>Disparate;</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Coincident;</hi> sometimes they are applied to such Terms as are <hi>incapable</hi> to admit them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out palpable Nonsense; very often when all is done, they are Impertinent: And, frequently, whereas the Distinction should <hi>divide</hi> the Notion of the <hi>Genus,</hi> and <hi>include</hi> it, one of the Members will perfectly <hi>contradict</hi> the whole Generical No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and pretend to pass for <hi>one sort of it,</hi> when it is point blank <hi>Opposit</hi> to it, and to <hi>every part</hi> of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:95549:233"/>
it: For example, I remember an Eminent School Divine, when (honest Nature putting a scruple into me, when I was young) I askt him how a Man could say he <hi>had done</hi> such a thing when he <hi>had not done it;</hi> he answerd very Soberly, that he had <hi>done</hi> it <hi>intentionaliter,</hi> tho' not <hi>realiter:</hi> Now, to do it (as he call'd it) <hi>Intentionaliter,</hi> is <hi>onely</hi> to have an <hi>Intention to do it,</hi> which signifies <hi>not to have done it.</hi> So that <hi>[Doing]</hi> is, by virtue of a Distinction, divided into <hi>Doing</hi> and <hi>not Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and <hi>not Doing</hi> is made one sort of <hi>Doing.</hi> And I do assure my Friend his <hi>Probable Assent</hi> is not a jot wiser; but has more faults in it than had the other, 'Tis not enough then, nor at all Satisfactory, to give an Answer <hi>fork'd</hi> with a Distinction; but care must be had that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction be <hi>Pertinent,</hi> and <hi>well qualify'd,</hi> as is hinted above.

               <p n="9">9. I heartily joyn with Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> in his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course about preserving <hi>Mutual Charity,</hi> and <hi>Forbearance.</hi> Tho' <note place="margin">Charity to Sincere and Weak Misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanders is a Christian Duty.</note> the Demonstrations of Learned Men do <hi>much Good,</hi> yet I am sure the want of Charity does <hi>more Harm.</hi> 'Tis in the highest manner Preternatural that Rational Souls should be <hi>forced,</hi> or dealt with any other way than by <hi>Reason;</hi> unless they come to wrong Common Morality, or the Peace of the Common wealth in which they live; both which are so evidently against the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> that their Reason must needs <hi>see</hi> and <hi>acknowledge</hi> it, unless most wickedly <hi>blinded</hi> with Passion and Vice. Alas! what <hi>Silly</hi> Reasons do good Weak
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:95549:234"/>
People take for <hi>Certain,</hi> and are convinced by them as perfectly as we are by the Clearest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration! And, (which more obliges us to pity them) if we propose to them <hi>strong Reasons,</hi> they are <hi>too weighty</hi> for their <hi>weak</hi> Strength to wield; and their own ridiculous ones do sute better with their Size and Pitch of Wit.</p>
               <p n="10">10. I am clearly of Mr. <hi>L</hi>'s Judgment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Degrees of Probability</hi> in several matters; as also that in <note place="margin">Tradition built on meer <hi>Hearsay,</hi> has little or no Force.</note> 
                  <hi>Traditional Truths, each Remove weakens the force of the Proof,</hi> if it descends meerly (as he expresses it) by the way of the <hi>Hearsay of a Hearsay.</hi> The bare Narative must either be supported by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant, Frequent, Open and Obligatory <hi>Practise,</hi> and be strengthen'd by the Acknowledged <hi>High Concern</hi> of Perpetuating the Matter of Fact attested, or it may in time dwindle away into a feeble Tittle-tattle. And, I very much esteem his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, as both very Acute, and very Solid, that no <hi>Probability in Historical Relation can arise higher than its First Original;</hi> unless that <hi>First Original</hi> were <hi>afterwards</hi> abetted and corroborated by <hi>other</hi> Motives. His Allowance of the Validity of the Testimony for Miracles, is Wise, and Pious; and his making <hi>Divine Revelation to be the highest Certainty,</hi> is well becoming a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Philosopher: For, all our Knowledge what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is taken from <hi>Things,</hi> made and establish'd by <hi>God,</hi> as the <hi>First Cause;</hi> and, therefore, if it be <hi>Certain</hi> that <hi>God</hi>'s Revelation or Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny stands engag'd for any Point, the Truth of that Point is prov'd by a Nobler, Stronger and Higher <hi>Medium</hi> than can be drawn from Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:95549:234"/>
or even Metaphysicks; that is, from the <hi>Soveraign Cause</hi> of all those Objects, whence those respective <hi>Mediums</hi> are taken; and, by whom onely they they have any Truth at all in them; no, not so much as their <hi>Metaphysical Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> it self.</p>
               <p n="11">11. It would not be impertinent on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, to present Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> with a short Story. A very <note place="margin">A <hi>more Firm</hi> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is due to Points certainly known to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd, than to Scientifical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions.</note> Judicious <hi>Cantabrigian</hi> desir'd to know of me, whether we ought not to assent to a Point of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, supposing it was <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently Reveal'd,</hi> more firmly than to any Scientifical Conclusion? I answer'd, that <hi>we ought.</hi> He ask'd, <hi>Why?</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that, since there could not be any <hi>greater</hi> Certainty that it was reveal'd than <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,</hi> the Assent to the Conclusion could not, <hi>in true Reason,</hi> be more Firm than that which a Demonstration produces, or than the Conclusion of any <hi>Science:</hi> For, let the Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gism be this, [Whatever God said, is True: But, God said there will be a Resurrection of our Bodies; Therefore, there will be such a Resurrection:] None can pretend (said he) any greater Certainty than that of <hi>Science,</hi> for the Certainty of the Authority that gave us the <hi>Minor;</hi> therefore, since <hi>Conclusio sequitur deterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem partem,</hi> the Assent to the Conclusion can be, in true Reason, no greater than that of <hi>Science.</hi> I reply'd, that that Saying of the Logicians was meant of the <hi>Particularity</hi> or <hi>Negativeness</hi> found in the Premisses, and not of the Force of the <hi>Medium.</hi> I alledg'd, that the <hi>Major</hi> had the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:95549:235"/>
greater Influence upon the Conclusion, (whence that Proposition so called, had its Appellation,) than the <hi>Minor;</hi> which was onely an <hi>Applier</hi> of the Force of the <hi>Major</hi> to some Particular, or some other Notion, in order to <hi>conclude</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it; and therefore, the Certainty of the Conclusion was chiefly to be rated from the Force of the <hi>Major:</hi> Whence, those <hi>Enthymems,</hi> which have the <hi>Major</hi> for their Antecedent, are more Natural than those which have the <hi>Minor.</hi> I insisted, that the Divine Authority being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd for the onely <hi>Medium</hi> or Motive for all Revealed Points whatever, our Assent to the Verity of all such Points, was onely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funded into <hi>It;</hi> and, that it lost not its Force by its being <hi>apply'd</hi> by a weaker <hi>Medium</hi> to some Particular, provided that Supream Authority's standing engag'd for that Particular, were <hi>close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apply'd</hi> to our Mind; which is done by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Certainty and Evidence. To illustrate which, I brought this Instance. Let there be two Agents, whereof the one is <hi>Calidum ut octo,</hi> the other <hi>Calidum ut duo,</hi> and both of them <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd</hi> to the same Patient <hi>equally;</hi> it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from this <hi>Equal Application,</hi> that they will have an <hi>Equal Effect;</hi> but the Heat produced by the <hi>one,</hi> will be more Intense than that which was caused by the <hi>other.</hi> So, supposing two Syllogisms, the <hi>Minors</hi> of which are both known by <hi>Science;</hi> but of the <hi>Majors,</hi> one is known onely by Science, the other by an infinitely higher Evidence, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Essential Veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Divine Authority; it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, from the <hi>Equal</hi> Application of it, by the respective <hi>Minors,</hi> to this or that Particular,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:95549:235"/>
Subsum'd under them, that the Assent to the two Conclusions, which is the <hi>Effect</hi> they are to produce in our Minds, will be <hi>Equal;</hi> but they will operate according to their <hi>Several Forces,</hi> provided the Force of both be but <hi>Close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> apply'd to our Minds, so to make it work its <hi>Full Effect;</hi> which is done by seeing both the <hi>Minors</hi> to be Absolutely Certain and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. I have not Time to dilate on this high Point as it deserves, but leave it to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Reflexion of all Judicious Lovers of Truth, who seriously desire that Christian Principles may approve themselves to be, in all respects, perfectly Rational. And 'tis a Duty we all owe to our selves, and to the World, to shew that Christian Faith does not <hi>pervert</hi> or <hi>impair,</hi> but <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>exalt</hi> our Reason.</p>

THis Learned Author states Reason very right in all its Parts; but, I believe, he mistakes the right End, Intention and Use of <hi>Syllogisms;</hi> and that, <note place="margin">How Syllogisms came to be invented at first.</note> while he opposes them, he takes his Measures from the Modern School-way of Syllogistick Arguing, and the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Fruit it has yielded. Such Forms of Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were, certainly, never intended for the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, as by his Discourse he seems to apprehend; nor for Men of good Mother-Wits, to attain Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Knowledge, by <hi>casting</hi> their Thoughts in those <hi>Exact Molds.</hi> For, Mankind could <hi>use</hi> their Reason, and <hi>improve</hi> in it too; nay, could draw their Consequences (generally) very well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Syllogistick Reasoning came in fashion; tho' they could not <hi>so well make it out</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or others, <hi>why</hi> the Consequence <hi>must</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, nor refund it into its <hi>Causes,</hi> and so set it above Contest, by <hi>reducing it to Evidence.</hi> Their own Natural Genius taught them to discourse right, very often <hi>unreflectingly;</hi> as it does also the Vulgar in Things within their Ken. In process of Time, <hi>Reflecters</hi> upon Nature, finding (as it were) by Experience, that some Discourses <hi>were</hi>
                  <pb n="429" facs="tcp:95549:236"/>
evidently Consequent, some <hi>not,</hi> they began to cast about and find out by what Virtue <hi>some</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses came to be so evidently Conclusive <hi>above others.</hi> And, to this end <hi>(Art,</hi> if truly such, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but a <hi>deep Inspection into Nature)</hi> they set themselves to anatomize and dissect a <hi>Rational Discourse,</hi> that so they might discover the hidden Nerves and Ligaments that gave Force and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion to the whole. They found that such a Discourse did consist of three <hi>main</hi> Parts, call'd <hi>Propositions;</hi> and each of these again, of three les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser parts, called by them <hi>Subject, Copula,</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate;</hi> all which had Distinct Natures and Offices in the Discourse. They discover'd that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the two Terms in the Conclusion, in which consists the <hi>Truth</hi> of it, depended on their Connexion with a Third or Middle Term in the Premisses; and that, if they be not <hi>connected</hi> with it or <hi>Immediate,</hi> but <hi>Remote</hi> from it, as all <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Mediums</hi> are, which beget <hi>Probabilities;</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is <hi>concluded,</hi> and so the Conclusion may, (for any thing we know) be <hi>False.</hi> They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd hence, that there could be but <hi>Three</hi> Terms in such a Discourse; and that, were they more, it caused a Blunder and Inconsequence. Hence they took Care those three Terms should be so <hi>placed,</hi> as would render the Connexion of the other Two with the <hi>Medium</hi> most Clear at First Sight. This done, they treated of each of those <hi>Greater</hi> and <hi>Lesser</hi> Parts, that is, of <hi>Propositions</hi> and <hi>Notions</hi> singly and apart; adding such Rules as they saw convenient for each. From these Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, laid orderly together, sprung the <hi>Art of Logick,</hi> and all the Rudiments belonging to it. All which have their Force from Nature; nor
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:95549:237"/>
ought any thing be esteemed <hi>Art,</hi> but what has honest downright <hi>Nature</hi> for its <hi>Ground:</hi> And, I hope, that in every Tittle of my whole <hi>Method,</hi> I have not one Argument in those many Trains of Consequences I have drawn there throughout it, that is not taken from the Nature of the <hi>Thing</hi> in hand. Now, things standing thus, who can think <hi>Logick,</hi> or <hi>Syllogism</hi> (the main End of it,) are to be slighted as of <hi>little</hi> or <hi>no use?</hi> Can any Man think that <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Reflexion</hi> do add no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to <hi>Untaught Nature?</hi> Or that our Rude, Natural, and Common <hi>Reason</hi> may not be Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated and Improv'd, as well as our Natural Voice, Walking and Handling, may be <hi>better'd,</hi> by being <hi>taught</hi> to Sing, Dance, or Play on the Lute <hi>Artificially.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. I am very apt to think, that at first the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venters of <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Syllogisms</hi> did never intend to use them <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The True Use and Abuse of them.</note> themselves, nor to instruct others in any Science by using <hi>constantly</hi> that Method. Since neither <hi>Aristotle,</hi> nor any other Author I ever read, Ancient or Modern, ever went about to deliver a Scheme of Doctrine in a <hi>Syllogistick</hi> way: But that, after they had by Study and Reflexion, found out in what their Evidence lay, they made use of them as <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplars</hi> or <hi>Tests,</hi> by which they might try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Loose and Dishevell'd Discourses had an Evident and Necessary Connexion of Terms at the bottom; or else, in some Signal Occasions, to confute and convince an Acute or Obstinate Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary; especially, if the Auditory and Judges of the Dispute were Men of Learning. For which Reason that way is still continued in Learned As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies:
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:95549:237"/>
Such as the Schools <hi>often are,</hi> and <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways should be.</hi> But, when at length that way grew too common, and that Sophisters and Bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers would needs constantly use <hi>It,</hi> and <hi>It only,</hi> in their <hi>extempore</hi> Disputes; which could be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd right, and as they ought, by none but those who were exact Masters of Logick; it came at length to degenerate into insipid Artless Wrangle and Talking at random. For, the Multitude of ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood and barbarous School-terms encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, frivolous Distinctions (as I lately instanced) grew rife; Principles were either neglected, or else supplied by their Masters <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; the Natures of Things, and the Ways dictated by Nature, were left off; and hence it came, that no Progress was made in <hi>Science;</hi> nor any Point decisively concluded.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In divers parts of this Discourse I doubt not but Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> agrees with me: What I disagree with him in is: <note place="margin">Objections against Syllogistick Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clear'd.</note> 1. I deny that in Learned and Philosophical Discourses, (for which Syllogisms were intended) <hi>the Mind can perceive the Connexion of the Proofs where it really is, as easily, nay perhaps better, without them.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the seeing the middle Term placed <hi>in the middle,</hi> as it ought, will make a Reflecting Man see better the Connexion of the <hi>Terms;</hi> whence, besides its own aptness to connect, it comes, even by vertue of its <hi>place,</hi> to be seen to be Immediate to each of the Extremes; and, so, more apt to connect them. Again, In a Syllogism there is no <hi>Necessary</hi> Word <hi>left out,</hi> nor one <hi>Unnecessary</hi> Word <hi>put in;</hi> whereas in <hi>Loose</hi> Discourses this last is always wanting: And, can we think it adds
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:95549:238"/>
no degree of Clearness to the Discourse to keep it from being pester'd with many <hi>Unnecessary</hi> Words, in many of which there will not want Ambiguity? Nor is this all, for in <hi>Loose</hi> Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, the fine Language and Plausible Tricks of Rhetorick do too often dazle the Eye of the Mind; and make that seem excellent Reason, which, brought the Test of a Syllogism, will be seen to be plain Foolery and Ridiculous Nonsense. <hi>Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Good Logicians, who are skill'd in the Solid Reasons <hi>why</hi> the Conclusion follows, do, while they discourse Syllogistically, guide their Thoughts all along by <hi>steady</hi> and (generally) <hi>Self-evident Rules;</hi> and see <hi>a priori,</hi> and this, by the Highest Causes, <hi>why,</hi> and by <hi>what means</hi> the Conclusion <hi>must</hi> follow; which conduces in a high measure to <hi>Demonstration</hi> and <hi>Science:</hi> Whereas, those that have only the Assistance of their Uncultivated Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reason, do both want this <hi>knowing</hi> Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to <hi>themselves,</hi> and are utterly Unable to give it to <hi>others.</hi> I grant then, that the Untaught Vulgar in Common Conversation and obvious Affairs can need no Syllogisms; and that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman he speaks of, may have Wit enough to avoid catching Cold, tho' neither her self, nor any for her, do put the Reason of it into a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism; and so does a Milk-maid, without the help of Mathematicks, know certainly that the Diameter of her Pail is Shorter than the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of it; nay, both of them would be blunder'd, and know those Truths <hi>worse,</hi> were the true Reasons for them put into the uncouth Garb of a Syllogism; for Art is not their Talent: But to think that Learned Men and Disputants gain <hi>little</hi> or <hi>no</hi> Advantage by them above the

Vulgar, is to maintain, that Art, tho' never so <hi>Solidly Grounded,</hi> is good for nothing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To say that <hi>Syllogism helps little in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,</hi> is, I am sure, against Reason and Experience both.

                  </note> might as well have said in one Word, <hi>they are good for nothing at all.</hi> For it cannot be thought they are good to know <hi>Principles,</hi> they being <hi>Self-evident;</hi> and, it is manifest they cannot help us in <hi>Probabilities;</hi> for a Syllogism that does not <hi>conclude</hi> is not worth a Straw; and no Medium that is meerly <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> (it being a <hi>Remote</hi> one) can be connected with the Extremes, nor consequently can it <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</hi> 'Tis left then, that if they help little in <hi>Demonstration,</hi> they do not help us much in any thing. We need then very strong Arguments to make us yield to such a Paradox. Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses <hi>Syllogism is sometimes good to discover Fallacies:</hi> I take leave to say they are <hi>always</hi> good for that End: And does this help <hi>us little in Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> All Argumentations are either <hi>Conclusive</hi> or <hi>Inconclusive;</hi> Conclusive ones have a middle Term immediately connected with the Extremes; <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conclusive</hi> ones either are aim'd to deceive us, by bringing a <hi>Bad Medium,</hi> or by using a <hi>Bad Form;</hi> and those are the <hi>worst</hi> sort of <hi>Fallacies,</hi> or of such Syllogisms as lead us into <hi>Errour;</hi> most of those Fallacies noted in common Logick-books, being but Trifles. If then the Syllogistick way <hi>discovers Fallacies,</hi> it cannot be deny'd but it exceedingly helps <hi>Conclusive</hi> Argumentation, or <hi>Demonstration.</hi> He grants too, that <hi>it sets the absent Proposition</hi> (and, so, the whole Argument) <hi>before the View in a Clear Light.</hi> I infer; therefore without it, we should
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:95549:239"/>
not have had so <hi>Clear</hi> a Knowledge of the Proof, nor consequently of the Conclusion; and is this nothing? But he thinks this good is over ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by this, <hi>that</hi> it <hi>engages the Mind in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity of Obscure, Equivocal and Fallacious Terms.</hi> Let us blame then those Logicians, who <hi>multiply</hi> Terms and needless Crotchets, (which I have endeavour'd in my <hi>Method,</hi> to lop off as <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous)</hi> and those Authors who do not <hi>define</hi> those Terms they use; and not <hi>Syllogism</hi> nor <hi>Artificial Logick,</hi> which tells them they <hi>ought</hi> to do it. I know no more, properly and peculiarly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Syllogism, but a Middle Term rightly placed; as is usually done in the <hi>First Figure,</hi> and according to the <hi>First Four Moods.</hi> Nor do I see any thing in these that in my <hi>Method</hi> is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Clear Evidence. 'Tis confest too that it is adapted <hi>to the attaining Victory in Disputes.</hi> Now, if this be so, then the Champion of Truth, by means of <hi>Syllogism,</hi> will make Truth <hi>Victorious;</hi> and then, how it can be deny'd (as Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> does) that it <hi>confirms Truth in fair Enquiries,</hi> is to me Unintelligible; unless by <hi>Fair Enquiries</hi> he means <hi>Loose Discourses,</hi> which are not <hi>Syllogistical,</hi> nor reducible to that Form; which I think is an Improper and Lukewarm expression; For, a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher ought to esteem no Discourse <hi>Fair,</hi> which is not <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Conclusive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Indeed Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> says very well, that <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism is of no use at all in Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities.</hi> And there is very good <note place="margin">Syllogisms are of no use in <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Discourses.</note> Reason <hi>why.</hi> For Syllogism shows an Infallibly-Certain way of Concluding; whence nothing can bear that Test but what <hi>does Conclude;</hi> Whereas <hi>Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>

being grounded on <hi>Common Mediums,</hi> do not conclude <hi>at all;</hi> and therefore it would do Probability a Great Disservice to bring it to the Touchstone of all True or Conclusive Reasoning, a Syllogistick Form. This would quickly lay open the Incoherence of the Terms, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, show those Men to be <hi>less Rational</hi> who <hi>do Assent,</hi> or say interiourly, <hi>The Terms do cohere,</hi> or <hi>the Thing is True,</hi> upon a <hi>Probable</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, in which they do <hi>not Cohere.</hi> 'Tis then by <hi>Sagacious Prudence,</hi> and not by <hi>Syllogisms,</hi> that the <hi>Degrees of Probability</hi> are to be weighed and try'd. He grants also that Syllogism <hi>serves to fence:</hi> And so it does, tho' not in Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s sense of that word. For, as an expert Fencer easily Wounds, and overthrows an Enemy, who is not Skilful in that <hi>Art:</hi> So a Man who is Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in <hi>Syllogism,</hi> which is <hi>the Art of Concluding evidently,</hi> will quickly confound and overthrow an Adversary of Truth. But why he should think it does not serve to <hi>increase Knowledge,</hi> is a strange Riddle; the whole Design of Artificial, or Syllogistick, Reasoning being to Deduce Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions <hi>not yet known,</hi> from Premisses which are either perfectly <hi>Foreknown,</hi> or at least <hi>better known.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> has then good reason to say, that <hi>Other Helps should be sought:</hi> But, if <hi>Syllogism</hi> be discarded, where <note place="margin">Other Mistakes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Syllogism Clear'd.</note> any <hi>other Help</hi> can be found to make the <hi>force</hi> and <hi>Clearness</hi> of the Consequence <hi>better</hi> appear, or upon more evident and more Certain Grounds, not the Wit of Mankind can Imagin: And I defy any Man to bring me any Reason, that is a good one, or

Conclusive, but I will show him that it is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valently a Syllogism; and I will undertake to reduce it to that Form; and manifest that it has all its Strength and Evidence from the same Principles which give a Syllogism to be <hi>clearly Conclusive.</hi> I know not what Authors Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> may have met with, who say we <hi>cannot Reason about particulars,</hi> or, that <hi>No Syllogistick Reasoning can be right and conclusive, but what has at least one General Proposition in it:</hi> I am sure I have shown the contrary in my Method. <hi>B.</hi> 3. <hi>L.</hi> 2. § 21. Indeed I show § 22. and § 24. that such Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logisms are not Instrumental to <hi>Science,</hi> as are those which have one or more, <hi>Universal</hi> Premisses: For, all Science is of Inadequate or <hi>Abstracted</hi> Notions, which are <hi>Universal</hi> ones, and not <hi>Particulars;</hi> for who can pretend to have <hi>Science</hi> of the <hi>whole</hi> Complexion of Accidents, which constitute any Particulars? And, to let my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der farther see, that the Knowledge of <hi>Particular</hi> Conclusions cannot reach Science, I desire him to reflect, that if a Physician knew onely that <hi>this</hi> Particular <hi>Individual</hi> Herb is good for such a Disease, and not that <hi>all</hi> of that <hi>Sort</hi> or <hi>Kind</hi> is so, he could not pretend to have <hi>Science</hi> of the Nature of Herbs; or, if a Mathematician knew onely that this Individual Triangle, which he is describing in Paper, has three Angles equal to two Right ones, but knew not that <hi>any other,</hi> or <hi>all,</hi> had so, none would much praise him for his <hi>Science</hi> in Mathematicks.

               <p n="7">7. I cannot let this Chapter pass, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting particularly on Mr. <hi>L</hi>'s saying, that <hi>Inferences or Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences</hi>

                  <hi>in Words, are a great part of Reason,</hi> tho' the Agreement, or Disagreement of <hi>Ideas</hi> be the <hi>Principal.</hi> Now, it is evident by those expressions that he speaks of <hi>Words Abstractedly</hi> or <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinctly,</hi> from the <hi>Ideas</hi> signify'd by them; that is, from their <hi>Sense;</hi> taking <hi>Words</hi> in which sense they are no more but meer <hi>Sounds.</hi> Whence I see not but Black-smiths striking orderly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly upon their Anvil, may make <hi>as good Consequences,</hi> as those he speaks of, and puts them to be a <hi>great part of our Reason.</hi> I have observ'd that this Acute Author fancies Unintelligible Mysteries in the <hi>Annexing</hi> Words to his <hi>Ideas;</hi> Nay, (as appears here) in <hi>Words</hi> taken without <hi>Ideas,</hi> or the <hi>Sense</hi> of them; that is in <hi>Senseless Sounds</hi> or <hi>Characters.</hi> Whereas my weak Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, tho' I bend my sight never so strongly, cannot discern any Annexion <hi>other</hi> than this, that Men have agreed that such Words, shall signify such and such Things or Notions; all other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion being Unaccountable.

               <p n="8">8.

My Judgment in the Point is this, that supposing the Revelation is grounded on the Means laid by <hi>God</hi> to assure us he has Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd such and such Points, (which therefore cannot but be <hi>Certain to us,</hi> or <hi>Evident,</hi> at least to those who are Guides to others) the Case imply'd here is impossible; because it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that God, who gave us our Nature, <hi>should</hi> (as Mr. <hi>L.</hi> well expresses it) <hi>will us to admit any thing for true, in a direct Contradiction to the Clear Evidence of our Understanding.</hi> I add, not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it as <hi>True,</hi> if the Motives be <hi>but</hi> Probable, or (which is the same) if the Thing <hi>may be False.</hi> What I am here to note, is that, Two Cautions are necessary in this occasion. The one, that since <hi>God</hi> does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">The First Caution to be observ'd, in order to this Point.</note> 
                  <hi>needlessly,</hi> therefore the Points Reveal'd by God are such as Humane Reason could not other ways attain to; whence they being such as those Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> holds to be <hi>above Reason,</hi> hence they must oft look very oddly to those <hi>Low Conceptions</hi> which the
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:95549:242"/>
Course of <hi>Nature</hi> affords us: Whereas the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> laid by <hi>God</hi> for Mankind, to embrace Christian Faith, do, for that very regard, <hi>lie level</hi> to our Natural Reason. Wherefore, in our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry what we are to embrace, what not; we <hi>ought not</hi> to begin our quest, by scanning the <hi>Points</hi> propos'd to us as Reveal'd; but, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining whether the <hi>Motives</hi> to judge they are Reveal'd, be <hi>Certain</hi> or <hi>no.</hi> Otherwise, we shall Neglect to employ our Reason, in such Things as <hi>are suitable</hi> to her Capacity, and in which she <hi>can have Evidence;</hi> and task it to Consider what's perhaps <hi>above her reach,</hi> and of which, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, she <hi>can have no Evidence;</hi> which way of Proceeding is <hi>clearly Irrational.</hi> How many are there in the world who are reputed for Learned men, and yet have no Principles which are not taken from <hi>Fancy?</hi> Let then such short Speculaters loose, to judge of the Verity of Points (perhaps) Incomprehensible to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reason, they will be apt to fancy twenty Contradictions in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Incarnation,</hi> a <hi>Virgins Conceiving,</hi> the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other main Points of Christian Faith: And, were it allowable for any to begin his Search after Truth on this preposterous manner, the Persons must be highly Qualify'd to decide what <hi>is</hi> a Contradiction, what not, ere their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents can be thought to have any kind of weight. They must be excellent Logicians to know the <hi>force of a Consequence,</hi> and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things go to make a <hi>Contradiction.</hi> They must be acute Metaphysicians to know all the many several <hi>Respects</hi> belonging to Things; without which it will be hard to determin certainly what
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:95549:242"/>
Notions <hi>are in all respects</hi> Contradictory, <hi>which not:</hi> And, if they be not thus Qualify'd, their Skill is Incompetent for such a Performance. Again, if the Point do concern the Nature of <hi>Body,</hi> they must be able to <hi>Comprehend</hi> the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that Subject. And, in a word, unless they can <hi>demonstrate</hi> their own <hi>Opposit</hi> Tenet, plain Terms give it that they can never show the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> side to be a <hi>Contradiction:</hi> For, since both sides of a Contradiction cannot be <hi>True,</hi> they must <hi>demonstrate</hi> their Tenet to be True, or they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not demonstrate the other to be <hi>False</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory;</hi> for 'tis one labour to do both.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The other necessary Caution is, that men do not take the <hi>Bad Explications</hi> of some weak Divines for the <note place="margin">The second Caution to be used in this Point.</note> Point of Faith it self. For, such men, as Mr. <hi>L.</hi> well notes, being very forward to stop the mouths of all Opponents by crying out such a Position <hi>is of Faith;</hi> and, withall, having a high Opinion of their own Sentiments, and <hi>Miscall'd Authority;</hi> are apt to fancy that all is <hi>of Faith</hi> which belongs to their own Explication of it, or seems to them <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> from it, or Connected with it; which is no better, in Effect, than to obtrude their <hi>own Skill in drawing Consequences</hi> upon Men for <hi>Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.</hi> Now, if the Explicater be not truly Learned and Candid, then in stead of showing the Point of Faith, <hi>Conformable</hi> to Nature, as a Solid Divine <hi>ought;</hi> he may hap to represent every Point of Faith so <hi>untowardly,</hi> that it may have Twenty Contradictions in it. 'Tis therefore the Duty of every Ingenuous Man, to distinguish such <hi>Explications</hi> from the <hi>Point</hi> it self; and not to
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:95549:243"/>
pronounce too hastily of it, till it appears it cannot possibly bear any <hi>other</hi> Rational Explication, and such a one as is <hi>Agreeable</hi> and not <hi>Contradictory</hi> to the true Principles of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Nature.</hi> Which I the rather Note, because I have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that scarce any one point of Faith that is <hi>Controverted</hi> has escap'd this Misfortune; nay more, that <hi>Metaphorical</hi> Expressions have <hi>often</hi> (I may say, <hi>generally)</hi> been mistaken for <hi>Literal</hi> ones: In a word, let but the Grounds for GOD's Revealing Christian Faith be held and shown <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> (and the Motives lay'd by GOD to that end, cannot but be such) and the Divine Authority, thus <hi>Evidently Engaged,</hi> and <hi>closely Apply'd</hi> to our Mind, ought to subdue our Understanding to <hi>assent,</hi> notwithstanding our <hi>seeming-</hi>Rational Dissatisfactions. I say, <hi>Seeming;</hi> For, to put the <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> we have to know God revealed it to be <hi>thus Certain,</hi> and yet that there is <hi>Clear Evidence</hi> against the <hi>Point reveal'd,</hi> is to put a perfect Contradiction, or Impossibility. Which makes me something ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive that those Authors, who put such a Case (however their meaning may be good and pious, and they see not the Consequence of it) do deem that the Grounds we Christians have for GOD's Revealing our Faith, are not altogether <hi>Certain,</hi> but <hi>Probable onely;</hi> which leaves all our Faith in a <hi>Possibility of being False</hi> for any thing any man living knows; that is, of being <hi>perhaps not True.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Hence I think 'tis but a very sleight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Divine Revelation to affirm, that in <hi>Matters where Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Reason is not to be rely'd on in things beyond its Sphere.</note>

                  <hi>Revelation is to be hearken'd to:</hi> But that <hi>in Matters where Reason can afford certain Knowledge, Reason is to be hearken'd to.</hi> For, tho' it were so that Reason <hi>can</hi> do this, yet Experience tells us that Reason <hi>does not actually,</hi> (and this very often) what <hi>it can do,</hi> or all that lies within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of that power; but that we may often <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume</hi> we have certain Knowledge when we have none. Especially since of the two it is far more likely our Reason may discourse wrong of the <hi>Points</hi> that are Reveal'd, than of the <hi>Motives</hi> which God has lay'd for Mankind to <hi>know</hi> they <hi>are so;</hi> the later being within its Sphere, the other oft-times <hi>not.</hi>

                  <hi>Natures</hi> in our Mind, or <hi>Distinct Notions:</hi> Science being in reality nothing but Descants (as it were) on those <hi>Notions,</hi> and grounded entirely on their Metaphysical Verity.

                  <hi>Corollary</hi> I. From what's said it appears; that Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s two First Branches fall into one. For his First <note place="margin">Some very Useful <hi>Corollaries</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</note> Branch being <hi>[The Knowledge of Things as they are in their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Beings, their Constitutions, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and Operations]</hi> and his second, <hi>viz. Ethicks,</hi> having for its Object the <hi>Operations</hi> of Mans <hi>Will;</hi> and <hi>Logick,</hi> the Operations of his <hi>Understanding,</hi> which proceed from him <hi>as Man,</hi> (all Outward Actions that proceed not from his Interiour <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> being meerly <hi>Animal;)</hi> it follows that <hi>Ethicks,</hi> which is his <hi>Second</hi> Branch, is coincident with his <hi>First.</hi> For Man is a Thing, and has a <hi>Proper Being</hi> of his own, and his <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> are his <hi>Properties;</hi> and <hi>their</hi> Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations are <hi>his</hi> Operations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corollary</hi> II. Each of the Subordinant Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences deduces Conclusions about its Proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: Which, tho' Conclusions <hi>there,</hi> are the Principles to the immediately Inferiour or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Science: so that none can know exactly what <hi>Homo</hi> is, who is <hi>such an Animal,</hi> if he be Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what <hi>Animal</hi> is; Nor what <hi>Animal,</hi> which is <hi>such</hi> a Living Body, is, if he knows not what <hi>Living Body</hi> is: Nor what <hi>Living Body,</hi> which is <hi>such</hi> a Body, is, if he knows not what <hi>Body</hi> is; Nor, what <hi>Body,</hi> which is <hi>such</hi> an <hi>Ens,</hi> is, if he knows not what Ens or <hi>Thing is.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Corollaay</hi> III. Hence is seen evidently, how Necessary, and according to Nature it is, that those Notions which are <hi>most Universal,</hi> should be most <hi>knowable</hi> or <hi>Clear;</hi> in regard the <hi>Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> ones cannot be known but by <hi>them;</hi> and that being most <hi>Clear,</hi> they must (as was often shown above) be also <hi>most Simple.</hi>

                  <hi>Corollary,</hi> IV. Hence is seen also how all <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> conversant about our Gradual Notions in the Line of <hi>Substance</hi> (and the same holds in all the other Lines) come to be connaturally <hi>Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi> to those which have a <hi>Superiour Notion</hi> for their <hi>Object;</hi> and how <hi>Perfect</hi> Knowledge or Skill in the <hi>Inferiour</hi> Science, is Unattainable without Knowledge or Skill in the <hi>Superiour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corollary</hi> V. Hence is demonstrated, that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicks</hi> is absolutely the <hi>Highest Science;</hi> and that, without Knowledge or Skill in <hi>it,</hi> none can <hi>perfectly</hi> understand the <hi>Inferiour Sciences,</hi> so as to resolve them into their <hi>First,</hi> and <hi>most Evident Principles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corollary</hi> VI. And, since the <hi>Greater Clearness</hi> of that <hi>Notion,</hi> which is the <hi>Object</hi> of any Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, gives a greater Clearness and Evidence to the <hi>Science</hi> it self; and the <hi>Greater Clearness</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Notion arises from its being <hi>more Simple;</hi> and the <hi>more General</hi> they are, the <hi>more Simple</hi> they are; and the Notion of <hi>Ens</hi> is Evidently <hi>more General</hi> than all the rest: It follows demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively that the Science of <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> which treats of <hi>Ens</hi> as <hi>Ens,</hi> is the <hi>most Clear</hi> of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and, in the <hi>Highest Degree,</hi> Evident; and that they who think otherwise do guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by <hi>Fancy,</hi> to which such very Abstract No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are Unsuitable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corollary</hi> VII. And, since Evidence <hi>determins</hi> our Understanding to <hi>Assent,</hi> and therefore <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> which is the Determination of our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power, follows <hi>Evidence</hi> as its Proper Cause; it follows, that, as no <hi>Inferiour</hi> Science can be <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> without Knowledge in <hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can our Knowledge of any of them be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,</hi>
                  <pb n="460" facs="tcp:95549:252"/>
(or in the <hi>Highest Degree,) Certain,</hi> but by virtue of <hi>It,</hi> or of such Maxims, or <hi>First Principles,</hi> as belong to <hi>It.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corollary,</hi> VIII. The same Discourse that is made here of <hi>Objects</hi> found in the Line of <hi>Ens,</hi> and their proper <hi>Sciences;</hi> may be made and have Equal force in the <hi>Objects</hi> belonging to all the Lines of <hi>Accidents,</hi> and the Sciences Proper to <hi>them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corollary</hi> last. Hence the Doctrine of <hi>Words is no part of Philosophy,</hi> taking them as aparted from our <hi>Notions;</hi> because it has neither for its Object, <hi>Rem</hi> nor <hi>Modum rei;</hi> nor any thing found <hi>in Nature,</hi> or Belonging to <hi>it;</hi> since <hi>Words</hi> are meerly <hi>Signes,</hi> appointed by our <hi>Voluntary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation,</hi> to assist us in Communicating our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions to others, which can be no part of the <hi>Knowledge of Things</hi> or <hi>true Philosophy;</hi> Words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither Simple nor Complex, Adequate or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate <hi>Notions,</hi> nor in <hi>any</hi> Manner taken from the <hi>Things themselves.</hi>
