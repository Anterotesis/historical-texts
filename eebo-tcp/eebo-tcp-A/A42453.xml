            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Hence comes that conſent in the way, which <hi>Romaniſts</hi> now take to gain <hi>Proſelytes.</hi> But we may further obſerve, that by order they alter their courſe, and ſhift their weapons eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry forty years or thereabouts, ſince the Reformation, which indeed is no light argument of a weak Cauſe, which cannot ſtand without ſhifting the ground, and the defences of it. But ſtill they accommodate their perſenſions to the different temper and humour of our Countreymen, that are variable in ſeveral ages, taking advantage alſo from the changes in the ſtate of the Kingdom, in which the Church cannot but ſuffer ſome alteration in the outward form of Eccleſiaſtical Adminiſtrations. I can upon a good occaſion offred produce five Popiſh Propoſitions caſt abroad in A. D. 1623. and alſo the Anſwer of a learned and pious Divine then living,
<pb facs="tcp:61783:4"/>
and ſtill of happy memory. Thoſe were of a faſhion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what different from theſe Queſtions, but tended to the ſame purpoſe. For the chief aim of all ſuch writings is to amuſe Proteſtants, eſpecially thoſe who are unacquainted with true antiquity, and to put them off from applying the Rule of faith delivered in the holy Scriptures to the preſent Religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> and from attending on that Miniſtry, which is Gods Ordinance for our inſtruction, and under which Gods providence hath ſeated us, and to make men gape after an infallible Guide, which Papiſts ſay is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but for no other reaſon, but becauſe they hope (as they endeavour) to coſen credulous people to miſtake the Papacy for that infallible Guide. Theſe men are ſo blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſelf-intereſt and pride, that they ſtrongly preſume, that theſe five Queſtions, as being the two-horned Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Beaſt, are ſo ſubtilly framed, that whether we anſwer Yea, or Nay, we are catched for certain, and ſhall be forced to deny our own principles, and to confeſs the exiſtence of an infallible Guide ſomewhere, though it be in ſome undiſcovered corner of the earth. And they have ſuch a mean opinion of us for ſhortneſs of ſight, and eaſineſs of belief, that being once drawn to the acknowledgement of an infallible Guide, we cannot chooſe but take the bare word of a few Italian Factors, that the moſt magnificent Whore of <hi>Babylon</hi> deſcribed by St. <hi>John</hi> to the life, and deſigned evidently to be the Papal Power of <hi>Rome</hi> as it appears at this day, is the infallible Guide of Gods Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſhall add but one Advertiſement concerning the prepoſterouſneſs of this procedure. This Queſtioniſt in the cloſe of his Reply, ſays, that till his Queſtions are anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he hath nothing to do with the proof of any thing. It is a remarkable thing, that all Papiſts by the inſtruction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb facs="tcp:61783:4"/>
to all their Schools of deceit, diſpoſe their Diſputants to decline proving any thing, and to impoſe that burden of proof upon their adverſaries. But we that do take our ſelves to be in the juſt poſſeſſion of the faith once delivered <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 20.</note> unto the Saints, and indeed do build our Religion upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, that is, upon the <note place="margin">Luk. 16. 29. 31. <hi>They have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>let them hear theſe. If they hear not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if one ariſe from the dead.</hi> Where note, that the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures bear in them the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that was in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and alſo have the ſame efficacious vertue to beget faith, as their words had being orally pronounced, and where theſe lively Oracles are freely confuted, and faithfully applyed, (though by men that are ſhort of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but faithfull diſpenſers of holy myſteries) an infallible Guide is ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: Alſo mark, that where the Authority of Scriptures is deſpiſed, Miracles, (and there is the ſame reaſon to ſay ſo of Infallibility) are uſeleſs, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual to work faith.</note> writings of both, (as <hi>Abraham</hi> in his Dialogue with <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves</hi> gives the name of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> to their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Books left behind them) do reaſonably expect, that whoſoever goes about to draw us off from that Church and way of ſalvation, wherein we are engaged, unto another Society, under pretence, that we can be ſafe no where elſe but in that Ark, do ſtrongly and clearly prove, that our Religion is for the main body of it falſe, treacherous, and deſtructive of ſalvation, and that the Society to which we are invited by Papiſts is the ſole Miſtreſs of ſaving truth. For all that are acquainted with the courſe, either of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial proceedings, or of Scholaſtical diſputations, know well, that this Rule holds, <hi>Actori,</hi> and, <hi>Aſſerenti incumbit probatio,</hi> The proof lies upon the Accuſer, or the Averrer of any thing. But this puzling way without proving of any thing, ſavours ſo ſtrongly of deceit, and is ſo far from a fair way of reaſoning, that it can catch none but them, that are unſetled in their Religion, and Novices in both divine and humane learning. And becauſe there are too many ſuch in the world, whoſe precious ſouls are in danger at this time, the diſcovery of Popiſh illuſions is now become
<pb facs="tcp:61783:5"/>
a neceſſary work of the prudent and faithfull Guides of ſouls, who by Gods grace have an actual certainty of their Religion, and can juſtly ſay, in the words of St. <hi>John, We know, that we are of the truth,</hi> and, <hi>We know that God hath given us a mind or underſtanding to know the true God, and we are in him that is true, (1</hi> Joh. <hi>3. 19. and 5. 20.)</hi> although they have not the vanity to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to themſelves an Infallibility. So much for the five Queſtions in general, which whether the Divine hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered or no, it is now free for the indifferent Reader to judge.</p>
            <p>As for this Anſwerers Engagement in the Controverſie, it was very caſual. <hi>A</hi> Romaniſt that is very zealous to promote the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Intereſt in this Kingdom, had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to gain credit with the <hi>Eve</hi> by a ſurpriſal, and if the old ſtratagem had proſpered, by her inſinuation to draw in the <hi>Adam,</hi> preſuming that the Rhetorick of love would be more prevalent, then his Logick upon a conſiderate Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. To this end a Copy of the five Queſtions was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the perſons with a preſumption, that no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of our Church could give a fit and full Anſwer to theſe confounding Queries. And then it was to be hoped, that the parties aſſaulted would preſently deſpiſe, and then deſert a Church, that was unfurniſhed of a Miniſtry able to anſwer ſuch doughty Queſtions, as the refined Wits of Papiſts deviſe. It was alſo to be ſuppoſed, that whoſoever breaks off from our Church, would without any further ado at the next ſtep run into that which is next him, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe <note n="†" place="margin">

The Miniſter took the ſhort time of that expectation to read the Riddle, and after a ſmall ruminating took Pen and Ink, and ſet down the double Anſwer hereafter following, and reſigned the Writing to the Gentleman to be diſpoſed of at his pleaſure. Shortly after the Romiſh Mountebank re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his viſit, to ſee how the Pill had wrought. The Gentleman then took the opportunity to deliver him the Miniſters Paper. But many moneths paſt, before any return was made: at length a Reply was communicated to the Gentleman, who conveyed it to the Anſwerer as ſoon as he could conveniently, being at a diſtance from him by the interpoſition of ſeveral Counties. The Miniſter took his firſt time of leiſure to give his ſence of this Reply, by a Letter to his Friend, who was the perſon concerned in the Conteſt, as being the man aimed at for to be made a Roman Convert, that is to ſay in plain terms, a child of Hell in a double meaſure, for leaving the clear and living Well of ſalvation, and then ſeeking it in a broken ciſtern, or in a foul puddle of errors and corruptions. Withall it was the Miniſters intent, that the Letter ſhould be imparted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Romaniſt, that he might make ſome good uſe of it: For the Proteſtants charity is imployed to turn a ſinner from the error of his way, as well as to ſecure a Chriſtian in the path of righteouſneſs. And although this tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was paſt A. D. 1666. yet be that drove the trade pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued it no further, and hath neither (as it was on our ſide
<pb facs="tcp:61783:6"/>
heartily deſired) acknowledged his error, whereof he <note place="margin">Non eſt pudor ad meliora tranſire. <hi>Ambroſ.</hi>
               </note> might be convinced, and confeſs it with a wholeſome ſhame; nor attempted any vindication of his Writing, that we know of, which ſilence hath more of prudence, then any freſh proffer of more impertinencies could have. His ſilence therefore cannot be taken for conſent in a matter of Religion, where the confeſſion of our faith is a duty; but <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 10.</note> may be taken for a modeſt laying down of his weapons.</p>
            <p>Now as for this way of publication of all that hath paſs'd on both ſides, he that obſerves the bold activity of Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts at this time, may apprehend a ſufficient reaſon of it, without being told one. Indeed the Gentleman who had an intereſt in the Papers had uſed his freedom by ſhewing them to ſome Divines of our Church, who gave a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgement of the Miniſters whole deſign, and adviſed the Gentleman to publiſh that, which they conceived to be of a general concernment, and might prove a publick bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by the removal of a ſtumbling block laid in the way of weak Chriſtians, and might be uſefull to the prevention of much miſchief, which theſe Queſtions might produce, if permitted to paſs uncontrolled.</p>
            <p>The Miniſter hereupon hath been preſt for his leave to let his Writings with the Adverſaries to paſs the Preſs. And he conſidered, that there was no reaſon imaginable, why he ſhould now conceal what was deſigned for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of our Religion from the ſight of his Brethren, which he had before expoſed to the view and cenſure of our Adverſaries, who are ſeldom equal Judges of our Writings. Since therefore the five Queſtions are ſpread abroad by our Adverſaries, who may have too great a complacency in their own inventions as unanſwerable, if we all paſs them by as contemptible, but may be Gods grace, which often
<pb facs="tcp:61783:6"/>
works by weak inſtruments, and beyond mans opinion, be moved and directed to conſider their ways, and turn their feet unto Gods teſtimonies, even for their ſakes, who both <note place="margin">

But becauſe we publiſh the Writings of a Papiſt, we deſire to aſſure the Reader, that the Gentleman is not ſo void of Honour, which is his particular Conſcience, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is not ſo forgetfull of his Office, whereof <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 2.</note> Fidelity is the quality, as that either of them ſhould by any wilfull alteration corrupt and falſifie them in the private convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or in the preſent publiſhing. The Miniſter indeed in his ſecond pains of preparing all for the Preſs by tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, hath upon the review of his own Letter to his Friend added two ſhort Conſiderations, which for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſake are incloſed within theſe marks []. Alſo he hath made ſome ſmall alteration in a few ſentences for the fuller explication of his own Anſwers. This he thinks it neceſſary to advertiſe the Reader of, becauſe the Romaniſt who gave out the Queſtions and made the Reply, may have the curioſity to peruſe this Book, as being concerned in it. If then he ſhall compare my Letter as it now runs, with that which was formerly imparted to him, and find ſomething altered, and ſome things added, he hath yet no reaſon to cavil or carp at the Miniſters proceeding as unſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, or to charge him with foul play in calling this the Letter to his Friend dated <hi>June 18. 1666.</hi> For he hath
<pb facs="tcp:61783:7"/>
unſaid nothing, which was then delivered, and he hath only endeavoured both to make himſelf to be better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood then he might have been before, and alſo to inſtruct his Friend more fully concerning two particulars, which he had occaſion to treat of. If therefore the Romaniſt liſt to read this ſecond Edition of the Letter, he will have cauſe to thank the Miniſter for his double diligence to diſcover his errors, and to give him fuller ſatisfaction then formerly. And this comes timely enough to prevent his Defence, or to procure his Amendment. Thus (gentle Reader) thou maiſt perceive the whole deſign of the publication of this party-coloured Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall detain thee yet a little longer with offering unto thee a Conſideration that is near a kin to our Matter in hand. We ſee the indefatigable diligence of Romaniſts equal to that of the Scribes and Phariſees, whom our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour branded with the infamous character of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 15</note> and denounced a dreadfull Woe againſt them, for their reſtleſs travels, and diveliſh labours in compaſſing Sea and Land to make one Proſelyte. I deſire my Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Reader to obſerve the Parallel between them. The Roman Sheep-ſtealers of this Age, the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecs took upon them to be the Guides of Gods people in that Nation of the Jews which was the only viſible Church of God at that day, and had obtained great credit with the vulgar by the oſtentation of counterfeit holineſs, boaſting of knowledge, and pretence of Authority. The Jewiſh Church was then very corrupt in Religion, not indeed by Idolatry, as formerly before the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity, (for the ſmart of Gods rod lying long on their backs made them after their return for everweary of Idols) but by a tenacious adherence to humane Traditions; which burden,
<pb facs="tcp:61783:7"/>
how heavy and hard to be born, the Lawyers conſidered not, but the Scribes and Phariſees bound upon the conſciences of the people for religious Ordinances of divine original, not written in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but traduced by oral tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fathers. It was then (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks) <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 126. Mat 15. 3. Mark 7. 9, 13.</note> high time for the Lord to work, to lay to his hand, that is his Miniſtry, when they had deſtroyed Gods Law, and made his Commandements of none effect by the traditions of men. Yea, St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, that Chriſt died to redeem his <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 18, 19.</note> people by his blood from that vain converſation, which the Jews were enſlaved unto by the tradition of their Fathers. The Phariſees then, that took ſuch pains to make Proſelytes, did not make it their buſineſs to gain ſtrangers to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> unto a communion with the people of the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the pure Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for which Chriſt certainly would never have condemned them, as he did. But the aim of their labours was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their own party, by captivating men under their yoke of Authority to the obſervance of a traditional Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thereby to ſtrengthen their power and worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in that Nation, which was called by Gods Name. Now, for this inveagling of Diſciples to the keeping of counterfeit Traditions, ſome whereof were but vain and uneffectual to ſanctification, others were violations of Gods Law, our juſt Maſter curſes theſe ſeduced and ſeducing Guides for making their wretched followers the children of Hell, even worſe then themſelves, by engaging their new conquered Subjects to the moſt violent hatred, and fierce oppoſition of the truth, and the profeſſors of it. See now, how the Papiſts tread in the ſteps of the Phariſees, and in one particular out-act their crimes. Their pretence to the Chair of Authority indowed with Infallibility, their
<pb facs="tcp:61783:8"/>
outward varniſhes of ſanctity laid over their covetouſneſs and uncleanneſs, their horrid hypocriſies, I omit to ſpeak of. But their Proſelytizing is that which I propound to your notice. Their work is not to convert Pagans from the worſhip of Devils and dead Idols to ſerve the true and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, nor to turn Jews and Turks, who abhor Idols, and therefore are too rationally ſcandalized by Roman Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries, and averted from Chriſtianity by that conſpicuous Mother of ſpiritual fornications, but to pervert Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who know and worſhip the only true God through and with the One Mediator Jeſus Chriſt according to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Goſpel, and to perſwade theſe to break off com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with all other Chriſtians, who have obtained the like precious faith with themſelves, and to ſubject their <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 1.</note> ſouls to the conduct of Traditionaries, and ſo to become an acceſſion to a potent Sect or Faction in Chriſtendom. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Roman Sectaries are in no ſmall meaſure more pernicious falſe Teachers then the Phariſees, becauſe they not only evacuate the Authority of the Goſpel, and corrupt the purity of Chriſtian Religion, by novel devices, ſome directly repugnant to Law and Goſpel, others vainly ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, and all obtruded under the falſe title of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but alſo have introduced into their Religion the moſt groſs Idolatries, that ever the Devil did pollute the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate ſervants of God withall. Since then the purple <note place="margin">Apoc. 17. &amp; 18.</note> Whore hath made the Kings of the Earth and many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons drunk with the poyſoned Wine of her fornications, as St. <hi>John</hi> being in the Spirit foreſaw and foretold, and it is the labour of Roman Emiſſaries to invite Engliſhmen to drink of her golden Cup, St. <hi>John</hi>'s Caution was never more neceſſary for Chriſtians then now, <hi>Little Children, keep your ſelves warily from Idols:</hi> And Chriſts Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 20.</note>

               <hi>Phariſees.</hi> Since Papiſts are thus manifeſtly the heirs and ſucceſſors of the Scribes and Phariſees, let all that love their own ſouls decline the ſnares of theſe travellers to make Proſelytes, leſt while they think to find a new way to Heaven, which is called Tradition, they be made the children of Hell. Here indeed we have ſet one <note n="*" place="margin">2. Tim. 2. 26.</note> ſnare of the Devil before thine eyes, the Papiſts firſt ſet it to take Chriſtians captive, and ſet it in ſecret, in chambers, whiſpering in the dark, but now what was ſpoken in the <note place="margin">Read Luk. 12. 1, 2, 3.</note> dark, and in the cloſet, is brought forth to be examined by the light, and I hope, that this ſtratagem of our enemies is defeated by being diſcovered. Indeed it is a happy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance not at all to know the depths of Satan; but ſince God <note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 24. 2 Cor. 11. 13, 14.</note> hath in his wiſe and juſt providence let <hi>looſe Satan</hi> amongſt us, who can transform himſelf into an Angel of light, and transfigure's his meſſengers into the Apoſtles of Chriſt, who ſpare no pains to vent his deluſions, we had need to pray heartily, that God will be our Sun to enlighten us with the ſaving beams of his heavenly truth which ſhine in his written Word, and our ſhield, our ſhelter, our ſhadow to ſecure us from the ſnare of the Fowler, from the peſtilence <note place="margin">Pſal. 91. 1, 3, 6.</note> that walketh in darkneſs, and the deſtruction (the bold. faced Devil) that waſteth at noon-day. And that the Chriſtian Reader may be provided of an Antidote againſt this noyſom peſtilence, and that he may both ſee and eſcape the deceit and deſtruction of this ſnare, is the end of this publication; which God make proſperous to his Glory. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>proceed not upon any particular Kingdom, no nor upon any particular Church, nor on every one, or any particular mumber of the Prieſts or Paſtors of the Church; but upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative Catholick Church in a full and lawful meeting of the chief Paſtors to teach the Church diffuſive, what ſhe is to believe as matter of Faith, or to reject as errors in Faith, when queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ariſe about any of them. I therefore anſwer, that when any ſuch queſtion aroſe amongſt the Jews, they were neither to have their laſt refuge to the Kings of Iſrael or Judah, nor to the State, Magiſtrates, or common people for reſolution in what they were to believe; but to the lawful High Prieſt for the time, with his High Council or Synod of other chief Prieſts and Doctors, in the Law of Moſes. And they were to conform their belief to what they defined, and taught them; ſo that whatſoever either the Kings, or ſome number of inferior Tribes, or ſome particular Prieſts, taught, practiſed, or believed, contrary to the Doctrine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of this Supreme Spiritual Council was to be held erroneous, and thoſe who held forth ſuch erroneous Doctrine pertinaciouſly, or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61783:11"/>
practiſed publickly contrary to it; were to be eſteemed in their doctrine Hereticks, and in their practiſe Nonconformiſts to the True Church, or Separatiſts from it. If therefore a Jew in the times mentioned in the Querie ſhould have demanded, which was then the True Viſible Church, wherein Salvation could be acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the anſwer muſt have been, That it was the High Prieſt then being, and all theſe believers, who conformed their Faith, Practiſes and Communion to him and his high Council,</hi> ut ſupra: <hi>And all ſuch, as ſtood in oppoſitions againſt him, and diviſion from him, were Aliens (ſo long as they continued in that ſtate) from the True Church. Now if the Queriſt had proved efficaciouſly, that the High Prieſt with his fore named Council taught the people, either Idolatry, (the common ſin of the Jews) or any other breach of Gods Law, to be lawful, or any error againſt Gods Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be true, or any of his Revelations to be falſe, he had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown the whole fabrick of my Queries. But ſeeing this is not yet done by him, his Queries are neither an Anſwer, nor any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to mine, and therefore they remain in their full vigour againſt him. For notwithſtanding all he ſays in his ſecond Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (which is the main force of his instance) I have clearly ſhewed, a Jew of thoſe times, which was then the True Viſible Church, out of which Salvation could not be had. Now it is impoſſible, to prove any ſuch matter, unleſs he enervate the words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> Mat. 23. 2, 3. <hi>where he ſays, That whatſoever the Scribes and Phariſees taught, who had and did ſit in</hi> Moſes <hi>his chair (that is ſucceeded in his Spiritual authority) was to be obſerved and done by all the Jewiſh people: which ſuppoſes evidently, they could not teach them either error in Faith and Manners, as part of Gods word; for then he ſhould have commanded to do evil, and believe errors: ſo that they were infallible in their teaching till</hi> Shiloh <hi>came. And the reaſon why they were ſo infallible (ſays our Saviour) was, becauſe they ſate upon</hi> Moſes <hi>his chair, and ſo governed ſucceſſively the Church of God faithfully in matter of doctrine, as he did in his time:</hi> Upon the chair of Moſes have ſate the Scribes and Phariſees: All therefore that they ſhall ſay unto you, Obſerve and do it. <hi>And this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon proves not only, thoſe that ſate then when our Saviour ſpake

theſe words, but that all thoſe who ſate before them ever ſince the time of</hi> Moſes <hi>were infallible in all divine doctrines both of Faith and Manners.</hi>

                  <hi>The third Querie is therefore thus anſwered; That the Jewiſh</hi>

                  <hi>Church, (underſtood</hi> ut ſupra) <hi>could not teach any error, as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Divine Faith or Religion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>To the fourth Querie, I anſwer, That, though from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. to Q. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Anſwers, it followes, that the Jewiſh Church by divine direction preſerved the Holy Scriptures ſo entirely, that it never rejected any true part of Gods written word, nor received into their Canon of Gods written word any Book, or Sentence, which was not his word; yet it followes not thence, that every private perſon ſhould find out every particular point of Religion by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular or expreſs proofs out of that written word alone; but that the Authority of the Jewiſh Church,</hi> ut ſupra, <hi>in matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, ſhould interpoſe it ſelf, and determine the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Nor do the two Texts quoted in the Querie prove thus much: For that</hi> Eſa. 8. 20. <hi>proves only this, that they were neither to have recourſe to Soothſayers, nor to extraordinary viſions, but to the Law and Teſtament, when doubts aroſe. Now this is ſo far from forbidding to have recourſe to the preſent reſpective Prieſts and Governors of the Church, that the Law and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment command expreſly, that recourſe is to be had to them in doubtful caſes,</hi> Deut. 17. <hi>from the</hi> 8th. <hi>to the</hi> 12th. <hi>verſe, and</hi> Malachi. 2. <hi>from the</hi> 4th. <hi>to the</hi> 8th. <hi>In which places the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Law is reſerved to the Prieſt, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the Prieſts command, declared to be ſo great a ſin, that it is to be puniſhed with no leſs than death. And for the Scriptures themſelves, it was ſo far from the Ordinance of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>his Law, that every particular or private Believer had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, or opportunity, or ordinary poſſibility to peruſe them, and gather from them by his ſole peruſal, what was, and what was not to be believed, (as private Protestants now do) that the Law was only to be read to them once in Seven years,</hi> Deut. 31. 10, 11. <hi>and was accordingly performed by</hi> Eſdras, Nehem. 8. 1, 2, 3. <hi>And this was all we read in Scripture of the common People know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the written word. And it appears, that the people were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61783:12"/>
ſo far from undertaking by their own private judgements to attain to the full meaning of every hard ſentence in the Law, that it is ſaid v. 79. that the</hi> Levites <hi>interpreted to the people, and that</hi> Eſdras <hi>taught them: And v. 13. not only the people, but the inferior Levites and Prieſts came to</hi> Eſdras <hi>the chief Prieſt to hear from him the interpretation of the Law. Now the reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if he will make a parallel between the common people of the Jews and his Proteſtants, muſt produce ſome clear place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where the Books of the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and not only they, but the whole Old Teſtament was as common and familiar in the houſes and hands of every ignorant Jew, as the Old and New Teſtament is now in the houſes and hands of every ignorant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, which I believe he will find a very hard task, ſeeing Printing being then unknown to the world, it would have been very difficult to have found ſo immenſe a number of copies, as are now (ſince Printing) of the Bible amongſt Protestants. Yet are not we of opinion, that the Scriptures are either not profitable, (as Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſays they are) or not ſufficient (ſuppoſing them to be the written word of God by ſome precedent proof) by way of Rule to make us wiſe unto Salvation. For they contain many of the moſt important points of Religion clearly and expreſſely to all, who are not willfully pertinacious, and what they contain not in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular expreſſions by general rules they refer to the Church, and the chief Governors of it, to learn them from their mouths, or from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Tradition of Chriſtendome. But that every particular Chriſtian is to receive and know what he is to believe, what not, by his ſole peruſal of Gods written word, as though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular point of Chriſtian Faith were particularly ſet down in it, or by particular reſpective conſequences, or other particular proofs concerning every ſuch point to be deduced from it, is ſo great a Paradox; that no man (I think) who hath his right ſenſes can averr it. For beſides the unlearned, which is the far greater part of Christendome, whereof a very great part know neither to write nor read, and therefore depend upon the credit of others, what are the words of Scripture; or if they can read, know no other ſave their Mothers tongue, and thereby are ſubject to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miſconſtructions of the words or Phraſes in the Original; or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61783:13"/>
if they arrive to the knowledge of the original, know not the true Rules of interpretation of Scripture, and thereby run into errors; or if they know them, out of Pride, or ſelf-conceit of their own wit and jugdment, will not apply them: And as to the Learned, ſeeing they, after all their induſtry, skill in Languages, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one place with another,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>are yet ſo far from according one with another in the interpretation of divers places of Scripture touching points of Faith controverted, that there is no hope after 150 years diſcord they will ever come to an agreement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſuppoſe ſome learned men might have a greater inſight into Scripture, and approach nearer to the ſenſe of it, then thoſe that are leſs learned, or the ignorant; yet Scripture interpreted by private mens judgment cannot be a ſufficient Rule of Faith, or means to obtain it. For the Rule and means appointed by almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God to attain Faith, muſt be common and univerſal to all ſorts of Chriſtians; nor muſt there be one rule and means for the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and another for the unlearned. Seeing Scripture cannot be ſufficiently interpreted by the ſole means of Scripture by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,, as I have ſhewed, and Scripture interpreted by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men cannot be the Rule and Means appointed by Almighty God for the guiding of conſciences in all points of Faith, there muſt therefore be ſome other for the unlearned, and conſequently for all. Now this other means and rule can be no other excogitable (unleſs we run to the Sole private Spirit of Phanatiques, which is more abſurd then all the reſt,) ſave the direction and univerſal Tradition of Gods Catholick Church, as is above declared.</hi>

Nor did I ever think my Queries unanſwerable: for I know I could anſwer them my ſelf, or any one may do, who aſſents to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Roman Church.

               <p>
                  <hi>To the firſt the Anſwer ſeems to be affirmative. Onely there is ſome dubiouſneſs in the word,</hi> Chriſtianity. <hi>For all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks make a viſible profeſſion of</hi> Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Suppoſing therefore you mean true Chriſtianity in their whole Profeſſion, the Anſwer is accepted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the ſecond you add the word,</hi> Ordinarily. <hi>If therefore you mean by this, that ſome may be ſaved in extraordinary caſes out of the viſible Church, I take the Anſwer to be affirmative, that ſome may be ſaved out of the viſible Catholick Church, which I think is contrary to the ſtream of all Chriſtian An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third hath nothing of a Categorical Anſwer. For I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, amongſt all different pretended profeſſions, which is now the Holy Catholick Church by deſignation of ſome one, or ſome ſet number of Profeſſions now on foot. And you tell me what the Holy Catholick Church is, but give no deſignation of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular profeſſion or profeſſions of Chriſtians. Or if you intended to make a deſignation, you have anſwered</hi> obſcurum per aequè obſcurum, <hi>which can be no Categorical Anſwer. For it is now as obſcure among Chriſtians, which profeſſion that is which now profeſſeth the true Catholick Faith once for all delivered to the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as it is, which is now the Holy Catholick Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your fourth Anſwer is defective</hi> ex inſufficienti enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione partium, <hi>and not Categorical. For I put two parts in my Querie,</hi> Deſtructive of Salvation, or indangering of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You anſwer to the firſt, but you ſay nothing to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; wherein notwithſtanding was the main force of the Querie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your fifth Anſwer is not Categorical, becauſe only conditional. You ſay,</hi> The Catholick Church ſo long as it continues ſo cannot, &amp;c, <hi>Now this conditional,</hi> So long as it continues ſo, <hi>ſuppoſes, that the Catholick Church can ceaſe to be the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61783:14"/>
Church, which is both contrary to your anſwer to the firſt Querie, wherein you grant, that there is in all ages a Viſible Catholick Church, and a moſt damnable error in Chriſtianity. For if the Viſible Catholick Church can ever ceaſe to be, Chriſt who hath promiſed, it ſhall ever be,</hi> Eph. 4. 10, 11, 12. &amp;c. <hi>will become a falſe Prophet. But ſuppoſe, you had given a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical Anſwer, That it can never obtrude falſe Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then you muſt grant, that the Catholick Viſible Church is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the delivery of Scripture. If ſo, then is there an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Judg upon the earth concerning this point. If ſo, I require ſome ſatisfactory reaſon, why the Church ſhould be infallible in this and fallible in other points of Faith, ſeeing it is as great abſurdity to abuſe the world with ſalſe Faith, as with falſe Scriptures. Or what authority is there either in Scripture, or Antiquity, which limits the infallibility of the Church to the ſole determination of Scriptures. Or is it not as pernicious to a Soul to be put in danger of damnation by having a dangerous error taught it by the Church, as by having ſome Books, happily leſs dangerous than that error, impoſed upon it by the Church,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To your Concluſion I anſwer, The reaſon, why you are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the Proteſtant Engliſh Church, is not, becauſe it adheres to the Scriptures, as a Rule of Faith, (for the Roman doth that as well as the Proteſtant,) but becauſe they will have that the ſole Rule, in excluſion of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Tradition, and the voice of the Catholick Church,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nor is it any reaſon to refuſe to join with the Roman Church, becauſe it enjoyns one to renounce his Senſes and Reaſon. For it enjoyns this no more, than Scripture and the Proteſtant Church does. For was not</hi> Lot <hi>to deny his Senſes, when he perceived them to be Angels, whom his eyes ears and touch taught him to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving men? And how could our Saviour paſs through a whole crowd of people, and neither be ſeen, heard, or felt, without a decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Senſes? Now it is far more oppoſite to humane reaſon, to believe one to be three, and three to be one, and that in the very ſelf ſame being without any difference, or mutation, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve bread to be changed into fleſh, or one body to be in more places at once.</hi>

                  <hi>What you ſay of breach of Charity, is miſconceit of our doctrine. We cenſure not the Perſons, but the Doctrine, and that maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned pertinaciouſly and obſtinately. Now who does ſo, we cannot abſolutely judg, and therefore paſs no abſolute judgment upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. And this is ſo far from breach of Charity, that it is only out of Charity, that we let Proteſtants know, what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they are in, that they may avoid it; whereas other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhould be Flatterers and Sycophants in letting them go on ſecurely in the danger we conceive them to be in.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Council of</hi> Trent <hi>compoſed no new Creed, at all, but gave a Catalogue of ſuch points to be profeſſed by all thoſe, who were to teach in publick Academies, before they were admitted to that office. As the Engliſh Protestants do exact a profeſſion of the 39 Articles of ſuch as ſhe admits to Orders. I have nothing to do with the proof of any thing, till theſe Queries be anſwered by Proteſtants.</hi>

But now, though e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough hath been lately publiſhed by eminent perſons in

our Church, to ſtop the mouths of gainſayers or at leaſt to ſecure prudent readers from the dangerous practiſes of thoſe, who like <hi>Elymas</hi> ceaſe not to pervert the ſtreight waies of the Lord; yet I have taken ſome ſpare time to <note place="margin">Act. 13. 10.</note> examine what is returned to that Paper, which you know <hi>Sir,</hi> I writ in your Dining-room whilſt you ſtaid a while for your company to dinner. Upon the peruſal I find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that may render the defence of mine own former writing ſo difficult to me, as it may be tedious to you. For you will ſee that Oracle of <hi>Solomon</hi> verified, The beginner of ſtrife is like one that opens a paſſage to waters. As wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">Prev. 17. 14.</note> let in at a ſmall breach quickly ſpread to a deluge: ſo you may obſerve, how contentions about Religion begun by admiſſion of a few queſtions ſwell to Volumes that cloy, or tire rather then inſtruct readers, except they be ſuch lovers of Truth, as to ſeek it with patience. But leaſt my ſilence might give ſome occaſion to the Adverſarie of triumphing over our Church, (whereas indeed neither the validity of our cauſe or profeſſion, nor the credit of our Church depends on ſo weak a <hi>Baſis,</hi> as the acting of one of the meaneſt of her Children) I ſhall endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair this breach, and to retrench theſe bitter waters of Romiſh contentions againſt the Truth into their own channels. And that you may not be affrighted with the very bulk of my Reply, I ſhall not enlarge my diſcourſe to diſprove every particular, which theſe Papers may tempt me to contradict, but make ſhort animadverſions upon whatever occurs and appears material to our preſent Queries.</p>
                  <p>My firſt Querie miniſters no occaſion of diſpute. The ſecond, in which he rightly apprehends the main force of my inſtance againſt his Queries to lie, is attacked by him confidently, with ſuch weapons, as I may ſafely truſt you to judge of their validity. And indeed you that are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted in the poſſeſſion of the truth of Chriſtian Religion, conveyed unto you by the light of Gods Word in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which is held forth by a Miniſterie, that doth not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61783:15"/>
pretend to Infallibility, but profeſſeth legitimate Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to inſtruct all under their charge in the Doctrine of the Goſpel, muſt be Judge in the Court of your own conſcience, whether the Roman Queſtioniſt, or I, ſpeak that which is agreeable to the common Rules of Truth. And your Reaſon aſſiſted with the bleſſing of God, the Father of Lights, who freely and liberally gives wiſdom ſufficient to ſalvation unto all, that with humility, meekneſs and reſolution of obedience implore his holy Spirit of underſtanding, muſt be permitted to be your Guide in diſcovering the True Church from the Falſe; and may as well and ſafely be allowed to diſtinguiſh the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Doctrine from the corrupt and noxious: ſince this may be eaſier and ſooner diſcerned by the agreeableneſs of any Doctrine to the ſence of Scripture, in which all things neceſſary are plain, then the truth of a Church can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by thoſe Notes commonly given by the Papiſts, which are uncertain, variable, difficult to be examined, and (which is of moſt importance) not infallibly known to be the infallible Notes of a True Church, nor infallibly applied to their Church, except you will take their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of themſelves to be infallible, which is the thing in queſtion.</p>
                  <p>But not to make unneceſſary excurſions, I ſhall betake my ſelf to examine his Anſwer to my ſecond Querie. I will not waſte time to unfold the Logical term, <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi,</hi> though I can ſhew how unjuſtly this fallacy is charged upon me, and how eaſily it may be retorted upon him. I ſhall appeal to your reaſon, and leave you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, who is guilty of miſtaking the Argument in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, or of proceeding fallaciouſly. He thinks, he hath convinced me of ſuch a ſophiſtical dealing, by ſaying, That the Queries about the Chriſtian Church, to which thoſe propounded by me ought to correſpond, proceed not upon any particular Kingdom, no nor upon any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church. But I deſire you to conſider, whether there be not an exact analogy (as to the ſufficient way and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61783:16"/>
means of ſalvation) between the Chriſtian Church under the Goſpel diffuſed through all Nations, and the Jewiſh Church, which was the only Nation, which had then the peculiar priviledge to be in Covenant with God, and to enjoy the living Oracles of truth; and whether there be not a juſt correſpondence in the obligation, that lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the members of either Church, both to ſerve God ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely according to his will revealed in his Word, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo at the ſame time to yield obedience to their Superiors in the Lord, and according to that Law, which was given to Prince and Prieſts and People. The whole Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at firſt, as it was undivided, was the only Church of God: And the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> after the Rent, was the only Spouſe of God, till ſhe had a Bill of Divorce for her ſpiritual whoredoms. And therefore let any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Reader judge, whether I proceeded not upon a good ground, when I compared the preſent Catholick Church, with the only Church, though then confined to one Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſince both are equally furniſhed by God with ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent means to preſerve Religion, and both are equally lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to corruption in their members, and if you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s warning to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the viſible <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 18. 22.</note> Roman Church is more then equally with that of the Jews obnoxious to a grand apoſtacy and exciſion.</p>
                  <p>[There is indeed one difference between the particular members of the Jewiſh Church under the Law, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Chriſtians under the Goſpel, for which the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods ſervants under the Old Teſtament was much harder, then ours is under the New. For the preſcript ſervice of God being of old tied to the Temple at <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and the people being bound to worſhip God there, when the Temple was ſhut up, and the worſhip of the Lord wholly laid down, as under King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> (read 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 7.) or when the City and Temple were polluted and prophaned with the execrable Altars and Images of <hi>Baal,</hi> of the Sun, and of the Hoſt of Heaven, and Devil-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which were ſet up by <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> who required obedience
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61783:16"/>
of Prieſts and People, and filled <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with the blood of them who choſe to obey God rather than Man, (See 2 <hi>Chron. 33. 3, 9. 2. Kings</hi> 24. 4.) Gods faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants muſt needs have been in a ſad ſtreight between their zeal for Gods Houſe and ſervice, and their obligation to their ſuperiors, who cauſed, at leaſt urged them to err, and to do worſe then the Heathen (as the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks in that ſtory) when there was no appearance (as this Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſt fondly dreams) of a ſtanding Council aſſiſtant to the High Prieſt reſident at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> as a Viſible guide in Gods way, but the Prieſt that ſhewed their heads were all Sycophants and Seducers. But now the Service of God being ſpiritual and not tyed to any one place, nor the Law <note place="margin">Joh. 4 21, 24.</note> of Chriſt confined to one Biſhops chair only, but the Church being ſpred throughout all nations, and every Church, that is aſſociated orderly in any Kingdom, or Nation, or being endowed with a ſufficient power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and government, (in which the Chriſtian Magiſtrate is concerned) if a prevalent party of Governours be not only corrupted in matters of Religion, but alſo ſo abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of power, that the communion with that Church be unſafe, Chriſtians are much more at liberty than the Jews were, becauſe by removal of their habitation they may leave a gangrened limb of the Catholick Church, and joyn to a ſounder part, where they may, be it in the Eaſt, or in the Weſt, offer a pure oblation and incenſe unto God <note place="margin">Malac. 1. 11. Heb. 13. 10. 15.</note> with acceptance upon the Altar Chriſt Jeſus. This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of freedom and ſafety for the Service of God, and working out their own ſalvation, a Chriſtian gains above a Jew by the propagation of the Goſpel unto the Gentiles, and the ſettlement of particular Churches in ſeveral Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories under ſeveral juriſdictions. But ſtill the parallel holds between Jews and Chriſtians, both in regard of their duty to God, and their Governours, and in reſpect alſo of the proviſion for their eternal Salvation, when the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquity of the times is ſuch, that their Governours will either make the people committed to their charge drunk

with the poyſoned wine of their fornications, or make <note place="margin">Apoc. 14. 8. &amp; 17. 6.</note> themſelves drunk with the blood of Martyrs]</p>
                  <p>But he goes on to tell us, that his Queries proceed upon the Repreſentative Catholick Church in a full and lawful meeting of the chief Paſtors to teach the Church diffuſive what ſhe is to believe as matters of Faith, or to reject as errors in Faith; when Queſtions ariſe about any of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Now <hi>Sir,</hi> again I appeal to your reaſon, 1. whether you did apprehend, or could divine, or by any thing in thoſe Queries imagine, that by the Viſible Catholick Church (which he ſuppoſes muſt be conſulted as the Guide of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) is to be underſtood a truly general Council law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſſembled.</p>
                  <p>But now you may be ſatisfied, that when the Papiſts make a noyſe, with crying up the Catholick Church, they do not mean the Body of the Chriſtian Church diffuſive over the whole earth, which though it cannot err in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith neceſſary to Salvation (for then, it ſhould ceaſe to be a Church by not holding the head Chriſt Jeſus) yet can not this be a Guide, becauſe it cannot be conſulted by particular Chriſtians, or others, who having got an incling of the truth, and deſirous of Salvation, may be inquiſitive for a Guide. And though every Chriſtian which is a ſound member of the Catholick Church, by holding the true Faith, and being ready to joyn upon every good occaſion with all his Fellow members in the worſhip of God through Chriſt Jeſus according to the Rules of the Goſpel, be obliged to communicate his Light to any man that wants it, yet is not every man that agrees with the Catholick Church, an Infallible Guide: And leſs than Infallibility will not ſerve a papiſts turn when he talks of a Guide, though the poor ſouls in that Synagogue never ſee any but ſuch Guides, which are confeſſedly fallible, becauſe Infallibility is not the Lot of particular Prieſts.</p>
                  <p>And now being inſtructed to take their meaning (which was a ſecret not to be foreſeen) for their ſaying, I hope
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61783:17"/>
you have not forgot, what you have heard my Lord <hi>Falk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> often ſay, The Paſtors aſſembled in Council, though a governing part, are ſtill but a part of the Church Catholick; and this may be ſecured from the gates of Hell, though they may be permitted to err in matters of Faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But allowing all due honour of Reverence and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to a truly General Council lawfully aſſembled in the name of Chriſt, and proceeding ſincerely by the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt; I deſire you to conſider, how particular Chriſtians are by this mans explication of the word, <hi>Church,</hi> ſet forward in the way to find that which is pretended to be abſolutely neceſſary, to wit, an Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Guide in matters of Faith, and holy Life. You know, that, after the Apoſtles had finiſhed their courſe, the Church ſubſiſted upon the ſtock of their doctrine, with an ordinary Miniſtry erected and ſupported by Chriſt in ſeveral Churches reſpectively, for many years, and ſome ages without a general Council. Yet particular Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had all that while a ſufficiency of certain means for the conduct of their Souls in the wayes of Truth, Peace, and Holyneſs, unto eternal life. And therefore doth it not appear evident, that there was Salvation attained without a Church in the ſenſe of this Queriſt? But never was there Salvation out of the Catholick Church. I pray marke now, who is ignorant of, or wilfully miſtakes the Argument we treat of, the Queriſt, or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, I deſire you to conſider, in what a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you are intangled, without certain path, or iſſue, if once you be perſwaded to forſake your ordinary Guides, who lead you not by their own light, but by the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn they hold forth, which enables you to judge of their leading and your own walking in the right way, and then to look for this Chimerical Guide called the Church. For you know, 1. General Councils are not ſtanding Guides. 2. And how ſhall particular Chriſtians be infallibly aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, (and leſs then that, according to the common Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61783:18"/>
of Papiſts, will not ſerve for a ground of divine Faith) that a Council when it is aſſembled is truly a full meeting of only lawful Paſtors, and that they proceed ſo as to be aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt, ſince the Learned are not agreed on the Conditions requiſite to make the Body of an Aſſembly fit for the ſpirit of Infallibility; and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned are never able by diſquiſition to be aſſured that the Council which pretends to be their Guide is juſtly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to be ſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Again 3. Remember how ſilent Councils are in caſes of conſcience, and particular matters of holy life; in which there is as much danger, if you miſtake the way, of ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Hell, as in matters of Faith. If reaſon and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Paſtors, without any fancy of infallibility, can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Scripture-Light to guide our feet certainly in the way to Heaven, why is there more neceſſity of a Council to teach us matters of Faith, than to inſtruct us in holyneſs of life? Miſtake me not I acknowledg the Authority of Councils as uſeful for the preſervation of Peace, and for the more vigorous ſuppreſſion of falſe teachers, which corrupt the truth. But I ſee no abſolute neceſſity of that extraordinary power to teach the Church diffuſive the form of wholeſome Doctrine eſtabliſhed now by the Conſent of Ages to the Faith once delivered to the Saints.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But ſuppoſing a general lawful Council to be the only teacher, to be truſted, how ſhall particular Chriſtians be infallibly aſſured of their Doctrine; the knowledg where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is conveyed by no other means, but ſuch as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly fallible? And therefore you will ſtill be to ſeek for a ſufficient Guide according to the Senſe of this Grand-Signior. All the objections made againſt the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as they are uſed for inſtruments to diſcover the truth and the will of God (which certainly they were by God deſigned to be, for the benefit of the People as well as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors) will be more forcibly urged to the diſenabling the Canons of Councils from being a certain Rule of Faith,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61783:18"/>
than they can be to the degrading of Scriptures from that dignity in the Church: Since the words of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil in the original cannot be planer nor more expreſſive of the mind of God, then thoſe which the eternal Wiſdome and Holy Spirit of God immediately directed the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Scripture to endite: And their Tranſlations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Vulgar Languages are ſubject at leaſt to as many uncertainties as the Tranſlations of the Bible; And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there will ſtill be wanting a living infallible Judg, that ſhall expound and apply the Canons of Councils to particular Chriſtians, which may be called with leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Blaſphemy, a Dead Letter and a Lesbian Rule, then the Holy Scriptures are, when they are defamed by ſuch diſparaging Characters faſtned upon thoſe Holy Oracles of God by Popiſh writers, who are, as the antient Hereticks, <hi>Lucifugae Scripturarum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding his reprehenſion of me for a feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned correſpondence between the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Church, yet at laſt to maintain the infallibility of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils (which, if granted, comes very ſhort of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good his deſign, that we ſhould miſtake the Roman Church for the Catholik, and the factious Conventicles of Italy packed by the Pope to ſerve the intereſt of the Court of Rome for Legitimate Councils) He will be an Advocate for the Synagogue. And rather, then the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of the Scribes and Phariſees (who imitate their crimes, and inherite their woes denounced by our bleſſed Saviour againſt them) ſhall loſe their priviledg of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, the Jews, that in their conſiſtory perſecuted <hi>David,</hi> murdered the Prophets, ſet up Idols in the Temple of God, corrupted Religion, and condemned our Saviour the Truth it ſelf, ſhall have the Gift of Infallibility fined upon them. What ſhort-ſighted men are other Papiſts in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of this <hi>Illuminado,</hi> who derive the Pedegree of an Infallible Guide from St. <hi>Peter;</hi> when this man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces it from the Scribes and Phariſees, whom Chriſt calls openly Blind Guides, and from the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> at <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 24.</note>

                  <p>Obſerve what he ſays; <hi>viz.</hi> If I had proved efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, that the High Prieſt with his forenamed Council taught the people Idolatry or any other breach of Gods Law to be lawful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I had overthrown the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of his Queries.</p>
                  <p>Indeed I offered no large proof of it to you <hi>Sir,</hi> whom I know to be ſo very well verſed in the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that you could not be ignorant of the ſtory and the Sermons, which record plainly and reprove ſharply, the <note place="margin">

I may ask the Queriſt, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did K. <hi>Agrippa,</hi> Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt thou the Prophets? But I dare not anſwer for him <note place="margin">Act. 26. 27.</note> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did for the King, I know that thou believeſt them. For indeed the Prophets aſſure us, that the Prieſts, (whoſe lips ſhould have kept knowledg, and ſhould have taught the people the true way of ſerving God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people were bound to ſeek the law from the mouth of Gods appointed Meſſenger; but were not tyed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive chaff inſtead of wheat, much leſs poiſon inſtead of <note place="margin">Jer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 32. 28.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61783:19"/>
the Prieſt, yet they that handled the law knew not the Lord, the Paſtors alſo were brutiſh, and tranſgreſſed againſt God. <note place="margin">Jer. 2. 8. &amp; 10. 21.</note> But though the prevarications of the Prieſts in the Law, and their ſeductions of the credulous people to their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine (for if the blind lead the blind, and none were ſo blind as Gods ſervants and meſſengers, were in the Prophet <hi>Eſays</hi> daies, that they not both fall into the ditch) be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with a pen of Iron, and graven with the point of a <note place="margin">Eſa. 42. 19, 20. Mat. 15. 14. Jer. 17. 1.</note> diamond upon the horns of their altars, yet this Queriſt would have told a Jew that inquired for the good old way, that the Prophets of the Lord were miſtaken. For he ſays he hath clearly ſhewed a Jew of thoſe times, that the High Prieſt then in being (ſuppoſe for example, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> the Prieſt who to pleaſe King <hi>Ahaz</hi> ſet up an Illegitimate Altar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pattern of one at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and ſet aſide the Altar of the Lords appointment) with his crew of Court-paraſites was the true viſible Church, to whoſe word and practiſe the whole people of God were bound to ſtand and conform.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>SIR,</hi> I know not what apprehenſions you may have of this mans extolling the Jewiſh Prieſt with contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Gods Prophets: But I cannot without horror look upon the diſcourſe, becauſe I foreſee the conſequence of it, and diſcover the drift of it, which is to palliate, yea too juſtify, the Doctrines of Devils taught, and the Superſtitious and Idolatrous practices in the preſent Church of Rome, which are as reconcileable to the ſecond Commandement, and that of Chriſt, Thou ſhalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve, as <note place="margin">Mat. 4. 10.</note> the Calf in the deſert, and thoſe at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> and the worſhip of <hi>Baal</hi> were conſiſtant with the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that which the Prophets have done, he ſays is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to do, unleſs I enervate the words of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 2, 3. God forbid, that I ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to enervate the words of him that is the Truth it ſelf; but give me leave to ſhew you, if you do not already clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61783:20"/>
perceive, that there are no ſinews in his diſcourſe ſtrong enough to tye Infallibility to the Chair, in which the Scribes and Phariſees ſate.</p>
                  <p>To paſs by the obſervation of ſome learned expoſitors, that by the chair of <hi>Moſes</hi> (our Saviour did not mention the chair of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the High Prieſt, to whom alone this man no friend to Soveraign Magiſtrates confines the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Gods people) is meant, not ſo much the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Authority, (as the Queriſt preſumes) as the Civil Power, the Remains whereof yet indulged by the Roman Conqueror to the Jews our Saviour would have preſerved. Let us allow that Chriſt enjoyns Obedience both to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and to the Spiritual power then exerciſed by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of that Nation. What then? Do precepts of Obedience to our mortal ſuperiors neceſſarily infer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in Parents, who are but the Fathers of our fleſh; or in Princes, who though they be the Sons of God, and as the Angels of God, yet may fall as one of thoſe cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Princes? Are they thereby ſo priveledged, that they can never enjoyn any thing ſo repugnant to Gods word, as that the inferior ſhall be driven for tryal of his Faith to the choice of obeying God, rather than man? But though Kings are not made infallible, when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with a divine power, albeit <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, that a Divine Sentence is in the lips of the King, and his mouth <note place="margin">Prov. 16 10.</note> tranſgreſſeth not in judgement, and their ſubjects are ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Oath of God to keep the Kings commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <note place="margin">Eccl. 8. 2.</note> yet Prieſts, it may be, have a priviledg above Kings. You ſee, what theſe men would be at, and you may quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover their intention to ſeclude Magiſtrates from medling with Religion, when he ſays, that the Jews in queſtions about Religion were not to have the laſt refuge to the Kings. But the ſacred Hiſtory informs us abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, that the Kings of Gods people were the Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of the Law, and governed the Prieſts; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Kings by their ſevere edicts eſtabliſhed the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and reformed the Church, as well as the State,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61783:20"/>
and preſt the Prieſts (of themſelves otherwiſe backward) to attend their charge, and to teach the people, ſo that a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Jew might with better ſucceſs have made his reſort to an <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> or a <hi>Joſiah,</hi> then to ſome cheif Prieſts and Paſtors, that had been infected with the faſhions of an Idolatrous Court.</p>
                  <p>But not to inſiſt more on that, conſider the impudence of this man, who faſtens upon our bleſſed Saviour that which he was ſo far from ſaying, that he ſays elſewhere the contrary. For he affirms, that <hi>Chriſt ſayes that the Scribes and Phariſees were infallible, becauſe they ſate in Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Chair,</hi> and ſo governed the Church of God ſucceſſively and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in matter of doctrine, whence he concludes, that neither their predeceſſors, nor they, could teach Error in faith or manners. As I have evinced by the Prophets, that the Predeceſſors of the Scribs and Phariſees (or rather the Prieſts and Elders which commonly bear the name of the Church) were ſo far from Infallibility, that God himſelf for their teaching lies, overthrew their Chair; and for their propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Temple, in which they vainly truſted when they turned it into a den of thieves, God deſerted his own habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and laid it waſt: So he that reads the Goſpel will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive this figment of Infallibility, (not ſo much uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by Scribs and Phariſees, themſelves, as pinned upon them by Papiſts,) overthrown by our Saviour Chriſt were they ſecured from error in expounding the Law, and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people the ſenſe thereof, whoſe partial righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs our Saviour condemns as inconſiſtent with true <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 20. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> juſtice, and whoſe corrupt gloſſes Chriſt confutes, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes his own authority to their comments which adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the meaning of Gods law. But becauſe it may be ſaid, that this was a defect in them for want of light and ſpiritual obedience was the proper Doctrine of the Goſpel, ſo that this is not enough to convince the Scribes and Phariſees of error in Doctrine; I anſwer, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays the Law is in it ſelf ſpiritual, and it was a groſs ſeducing the people <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14.</note> in faith and manners, to teach ſuch carnal Doctrines as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61783:21"/>
incouraged and hardned men in ſin, and kept them from repenting of their vain thoughts and vile luſts, which lodged in their hearts. But to go a ſtep further. Chriſt that commanded obedience to them, (which neceſſarily muſt be limited by the ſtanding and known Laws of Gods people) expreſly warns his Diſciples to beware of the <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 11, 12.</note> Leaven of their Doctrine. If Chriſt did by the Precept alledged evidently ſuppoſe (as the Queriſt ſays) that the Scribes and Phariſees could teach the people no error in faith and manners, then why did our Saviour go about to ſecure his Diſciples by ſuch a Caution, whereas they had no reaſon to ſuſpect that which the Scribes and Phariſees offered them for the food of their ſouls? Their very ſitting in <hi>Moſe</hi>'s Chair was a ſufficient aſſurance, that they were as faithful in the Houſe of God as <hi>Moſes,</hi> (if you will take this mans word, Chriſt meant and ſaid ſo) and were ſo wiſe as they could not be miſtaken, and ſo honeſt as they would not give ſowr Leaven inſtead of heavenly Manna. Oh brave Patron of the accurſed Scribes and Phariſees! But Sir, I believe you have read the 23 Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> throughout, wherein our Saviour ſets out thoſe blind Guides, and abominable Hypocrites, who had the <note place="margin">Luk. 11. 52.</note> Key of knowledg (as the Pope pretends to the cuſtodie of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Keys) in ſuch deteſtable characters, as are inconſiſtent with Infallibility. But ſome will ſay, their corruption in manners doth not infer their erroneouſneſs in Doctrine, and therefore Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. though a Devil incarnate, might be infallible in the Chair, as a learned Lady of the Romiſh ſide, whom you knew, once told me. I anſwer, that it will be hard to perſwade a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Chriſtian that hath reverent apprehenſions of Gods holy Spirit, that the Spirit of Diſcipline will abide with <note place="margin">Wiſd. 1. 5.</note> ſuch unrighteouſneſs and uncleanneſs, or that perſons immerſed in worldly luſts ſhould enjoy the conſtant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and influence of that Spirit which leads humble and <note place="margin">See Joh. 14. 17.</note> holy men into all truth. But he that can perſwade you that they, whom Chriſt calls blind Guides, were not only <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 14</note>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61783:21"/>
fit but alſo infallible Directors, may with the ſame confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and arguments make you believe that the Sun ſhines in our Horizon at midnight.</p>
                  <p>I do not forget, that it is not the Pope's Infallibility, but a Councils, which the Queriſt pleads for by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Scribes and Phariſees, albeit they were perhaps Doctors of the Law, but few of them members of the great Council. But I touch this briefly, becauſe it may be the next Papiſt, that creeps into your familiarity, will be for the Pope; or perhaps this perſon, who hath in his ſecond Paper reſolved the Catholick Church into a Council, will in his next Paper melt down a Council into the Pope, which is the more likely to be a Guide, becauſe a living perſon to be conſulted with, if many reaſons did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our acceptance of him for an infallible one.</p>
                  <p>But that the Scribes and Phariſees were guilty of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 3.—9.</note> for Doctrines obligatory of conſcience, the traditions of men, and did by their devices annul the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and encourage men under pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Vows, to diſobey their parents, and by falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines involved ſouls in the guilt of perjury, is evident by our Saviours convicting and condemning them. Can <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</note> you now be of the opinion, that this ungodly fraternity of Villains could make up an infallible Conſiſtory by poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the Chair of <hi>Moſes?</hi> If you can entertain ſuch a conceit, you bleſs whom Chriſt hath curſed, and put darkneſs for light, and call blind Guides the Seers, and ſo <note place="margin">Eſa. 5. 20.</note> draw down the woe upon your ſelf. Indeed ſuch Guides are ſit for them, who wilfully wink againſt the light, and make themſelves ſlaves to the enemies of true Religion, who put out the eyes of their captived Proſelytes, that they may with quiet grind in their Mills.</p>
                  <p>I will conclude my Reply to this Paragraph with one Propoſal. This Queriſt defers ſuch honour to the Jewiſh Prieſthood, that the Prieſts ought to be ſimply believed upon their word till <hi>Shiloh</hi> came, becauſe they or at leaſt a Council of them could not erre in faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:61783:22"/>
I will not inſtance in the Council that condemned our Saviour, becauſe, although ſome plead for <hi>Caiphas</hi> by vertue of his Prieſthood to have been inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt which alwayes aſſiſted the Chair, yet perhaps this Queriſt will not extend the continuance of Infallibility thus far: And yet he that hath feigned Chriſt to aſſign it to the Scribes and Phariſees, cannot give a good and ſolid account how <hi>Caiphas</hi> and his Confederates came in that cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical hour to loſe it, or why the people without a manifeſt Declaration of God to abrogate their Authority, ſhould not then alſo be bound to believe their ſentence, though it were blaſphemy, and tended to the murder of the Son of God; or how <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> could be abſolved (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this mans principles) from being an Heretick and Schiſmatick, for not conſenting to the counſel and practice of the High Prieſt with his Aſſembly, for which very thing the Goſpel commends him to be a good and a juſt perſon; ſince at that very time the whole Nation of <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 50, 51.</note> the Jews were obliged, (according to this mans aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) by Chriſts own injunction, to reſt in the Doctrine and Determination of the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in matters of Religion, and conſequently to deny Jeſus to be the Chriſt. Think of this ſeriouſly. But there is another inſtance which I aim at. It is well known, that in the degenerate eſtate of the Jews there ſtarted up a powerful Sect of the Sadducees. Theſe, <note place="margin">Act. 5. 17.</note> though pretending to adhere unto the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet are noted to have been infected with pernicious errors in Religion, for they believed not any world of Spirits pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or to come, and therefore denied the exiſtence of Angels or Spirits departed, and the reſurrection of the body by the return of ſouls to reſume their earthly taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 23 Act. 23. 8.</note> repaired. The heads of this Hereſie were the chief of the Nation, and as it fell out in the viciſſitude of Prieſts, (whoſe office was made venal by the Court) the High Prieſt himſelf was ſometimes a Sadducee. (Read <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 1. and 5. 17.) when ſuch an Heretick poſſeſt the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61783:22"/>
Chair of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Aaron,</hi> who underſtood not <hi>Moſes</hi> aright, (as our Saviour aſcribes the error of the Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cees to their ignorance of the Scriptures) you may be ſure that men of the ſame judgement made up the greater part of the <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi> For the an moſity of the Sadducees againſt the Phariſees, together with their intereſt in the Nobility, was ſuch, that they would not allow many birds of another feather to pearch upon the ſame branch of Authority, though one Phariſee <hi>Gamaliel</hi> once was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be of the Council. Now then if a Jew loth to rely on his own underſtanding ſhould deſire to be inſtructed in this main Article of Religion, which is the chief root of obedience and ſupporter of patience, to whom ſhould he <note place="margin">See Act. 26. 6, 7.</note> repair, and whom ſhould he believe? If you will take the Queriſts word, The High prieſt with his Council was the true viſible Church to be hearkned unto. But if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their own ſenſe (and no body can reaſonably ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that they would contradict themſelves, or as <hi>Balaam</hi> once was ſo they all being met together in Council ſhould by a powerful Enthuſiaſm be conſtreined to ſpeak contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their own mind, and deliver that Truth which they did not approve in their own conſciences, and ſhould in ſpeaking Truth lye by the power of the Holy Ghoſt) the inquiſitive Jew was bound (contrary to the general ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the 12 Tribes, which did in the Expectation of a Reſurrection (called the hope of Iſrael) ſerve God day and night) to become a Sadducee, to diſbelieve <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to condemn himſelf to an everlaſting death, which ſhould ſwallow up his perſon and his piety, and ſeparate him for ever from having any communion with the God of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, &amp; Jacob.</hi> If the Council it ſelf ſhould happen to be divided by factions, and interrupted by clamour and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence from determining any thing, as it was the fate of the Council, to which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> appeared, then <note place="margin">Act. 23.</note> what is become of the Viſible Guide? Or how ſhall the Jews conſcience be ſatisfied of this fundamental doctrine? Certainly he muſt remain a Sceptick, and that is next de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61783:23"/>
to Atheiſt, if he do not find a clear Rule and a firm Rock, whereon to build his holy faith, which is the ground of a holy life. And if he do, he need not look for an Infallible Guide, which if he have yet the vain curioſity to ſeek for, he will never have the good hap to find.</p>
                  <p>I leave you now to judge of this mans reſolution of my Queries.</p>
                  <p>And though he be like the Scribes and Phariſees in his induſtry to make Proſelytes, yet I have no fear of you, but that you can diſcern the fraudulent courſe he takes to perſwade, and diſcover the ſad end to which he leads his abuſed followers.</p>
                  <p>Since now I have out of Gods word evinced that the Prieſts of the Jews, high and low, were not only cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in their private manners, but alſo groſſely ignorant of Gods Law, and ſeducers of the people from the true ſervice of God, and ſuborners of falſe prophets (for that <note place="margin">See Jer. 5. 31.</note> alſo may juſtly be taken into conſideration) for the ſupport of their eredit and power with the people, and imployed their Judicial power to condemn the true Prophets, I have <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 37.</note> done enough (mine Adverſary himſelf being Judg) to overthrow the frame of his Queries, which were ſet up, as a Gate or Bulwark of Hell to maintain the Devils deviſe, The Infallibility of the Church of Rome masked with the ſpecious Title of the Catholick Church. And becauſe I have alſo by our bleſſed Saviours ſermons and ſentence ſhewed the impiety as much as abſurdity of honouring the Scribes and Phariſees with a priviledg of Infallibility, I have ſaid all that I conceive requiſite concerning his anſwer to my ſecond and third Queries, which he reſolves thus: The Jewiſh Church underſtood <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> (that is, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the Church repreſenting the whole, and acting with authority for the government of the people) could not teach any error as matter of divine Faith or Religion. Only take this Corollary. He muſt have a mind able to ſwallow and concoct Tranſubſtantiation, that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61783:23"/>
theſe Idolatrous Paſtors, ſo often complained of by God, could do all this miſcheif in the Church, if they <note place="margin">See Jer. 2. 26, &amp; 23. 1, 2. Read Eſa. 56. 10, 11. Certainly blind watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, dumb and yet greidy doges, Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards that could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, were but ſorry Guides, and as far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Religion, as Hell is from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> had been as dumb dogs in the Devils cauſe, as they were in Gods, and as ſilent for teaching any error in matter of Religion, as they were in the inſtructing of men in the true way of God: Or that theſe ignorant and debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Prieſts being conſulted concerning the Law of God would, or ſhould of neceſſity by a ſecret and powerful inſtinct of an Infallible <hi>Genius</hi> perpetually waiting upon them, at leaſt inſpiring them upon ſuch occaſions, teach the people contrary to their own perſwaſions and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth Querie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The vanity, falſhood and impiety of the precedent Anſwers to my 3 counter Queries being ſufficiently evidenced, it may ſeem ſuperfluous to diſprove what he builds upon the ſand, becauſe this will ſink of it ſelf with the unſound foundation. But becauſe from that abſurd ſuppoſition of Infallibility ſettled in the Jewiſh Prieſthood, he inferrs, that the Jewiſh Church (he means the Prieſts, or chief Paſtors thereof: for he is much in proving that the people had very little to do with the Bible) by divine direction preſerved the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures intire without mutilation or addition of any thing uncanonical, I ſhall briefly conſider this Conſequence, which imports that the preſervation of Scriptures depends upon the Infallibility of the Prieſts, or the Church that keeps it. I confeſs that Gods gratious providence is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in preſerving his pretious Word, conteined in the Book of the Law. But I pray you conſider how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Prieſts above montioned contributed their care to the conſervation of the Scripture. For in the reign of Idolatrous Kings, who ſometimes profaned the Temple with Idols, ſometimes ſhut up the doors of it, the Prieſts, who baſely flattered and officiouſly ſerved their Kings, were ſo far from conſidering the Law at all (and much more from reading and teaching it publickly that it might be the rule of Gods ſervice) that in <hi>Joſiahs</hi> time the Penta,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61783:24"/>
teuch, or the whole Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or (as ſome think) the Book called <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> being caſually found in the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines and rubbiſh of Gods houſe, and then read by the High Prieſt, was looked upon as <note n="*" place="margin">Hoſ. 8. 12.</note> a ſtrange thing, which they were not acquainted withal. But though Prieſts were ſometimes careleſs Depoſitaries, yet God inſpired ſuch a Love of the Law into many of his People, both Prieſts, Levites, and Laicks, that that ineſtimable Juel was never loſt, which God would have preſerved to be the Standard of his publick worſhip, the meaſure of private devotion, and the conſtant light to their walking with God and with men in the fear of God.</p>
                  <p>And notwithſtanding the ſcandalous corruption of the Holy Order it ſelf for a time, pious perſons could then be, and were rationally aſſured, that the Book of the Law, as well as the law of the Lord, was perfect and uncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And I deſire you to take notice that this is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal thing which is aimed at by way of inſtance or retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his fift Querie. For if a direct true Anſwer be given to my fourth Querie, it will follow by Analogie, that Chriſtians may be as perfectly aſcertained of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of the Canon of Scriptures, though the major or more eminent part of Biſhops (the Biſhop of Rome not exempted) ſhould be infected with Arianiſm, as once it happened, and although all the Biſhops of the Roman Church (which the Queriſt would fain have us to take for the Catholick; but can never perſwade us that a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a Body is the whole, as we can never believe that The Tyrrhene Sea is the whole Ocean) do teach errors as matters of Chriſtian Faith. Now this being the deſign of my Queſtion, by getting out of a Papiſts mouth an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for a Jew to furniſh a good Chriſtian with an Anſwer to a Popiſh Cavil, and to enſnare the Queriſt in his own ginn, he craftily ſlips the Queſtion out of the way, and without making any direct anſwer to the Jews inquirie, as he offered to do in handling the former Queries, turns aſide to make an impertinent Harangue concerning private mens uſe of the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:61783:24"/>
Mark, I pray, my fourth Querie, and compare the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and you will ſee nothing of an Anſwer in this; That the infallibility of the Jewiſh Church was the means to preſerve the Scriptures entire. The queſtion was not about the means by which the Book of <hi>Moſes</hi> was preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but about the manner how a Jew might be aſſured of the integrity of it. Now the truly pious Jew, who with <hi>Jeremy</hi> bemoaned the corruption of the Church by the errors and ſeducements of the Prieſts, could not make that Infallibility (which he did not believe, becauſe he ſaw the contrary) the reaſon why he believed the Scriptures to be preſerved in purity and integrity.</p>
                  <p>And it is as impertinent to any of my propoſitions, to proceed, (as he doth) that it follows not thence, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very private perſon ſhould find out every particular point of Religion by particular or expreſs proofs out of the written word alone.</p>
                  <p>For I neither make, nor ſuppoſe any ſuch Inference from any thing premiſed in my fift Querie. But <hi>Sir,</hi> I would have you take notice, that when we make the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures the Rule of Religion, and Inſtrument to make us wiſe unto Salvation, we do not exclude the Authority of thoſe perſons whom Chriſt hath made dipenſers of Holy Myſteries; but alwaies ſuppoſe the Myniſterie to be a Means appointed for the edifying us in our Holy Faith. Again we allow particular Chriſtians, that are endowed with the Spirit of underſtanding, which is one of the gifts which Chriſt received without meaſure; but hath impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Eſa. 11. 2. Joh. 3. 34. Eph. 4. 7. Phil. 1. 9, 10. Col. 1. 9. Act. 17. 11.</note> to all his living members according to his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in a certain meaſure, to try the Spirits and as the <hi>Bereans</hi> did, to examine the agreeableneſs of their lawful paſtors Doctrine to the Scripture. And if a Prieſt (though the higheſt in a Church) tells Chriſtians, that the Bleſſed Cup in the Euchariſt is not to be given to all them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Holy Bread, or that God may be repreſented by any picture or deviſe of men in any ſhape whatſoever, or that any meer Creature is to be worſhiped with religious
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61783:25"/>
worſhip, the Sheep of Chriſt, that know their chief Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hards voice, may uſe their talent of reaſon to try theſe doctrines by the touch-ſtone of truth. But we do not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that it is neceſſary for every Chriſtian to deduce and prove every particular point of Religion out of Scripture. But ſince the faith once delivered to the Saints with the <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 4. Hoſ. 8. 12. pſal. 19. 7, 8. Prov. 8. 7, 8. Eſa. 35. 8.</note> rules of Holy Life are now written for our inſtruction and direction by God himſelf, on purpoſe, that they may be a Light to our feet, and make wiſe the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and therefore the Teſtimonies of the Lord are clear, ſure and plain in all things that are neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and practiſed; therefore every one according to the circumſtances of his condition and calling, is bound more or leſs to uſe the means vouchſafed him by Gods providence, and may by diligence ſatisfy his conſcience in building his Faith and Obedience upon <hi>Scriptum ect,</hi> It is written.</p>
                  <p>Now let us ſee what our Queriſt ſayes to prove, that a <note n="*" place="margin">The Jews at this day are ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved to their Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, that if a Rabbi or wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man tell them their Right hand is their left, they are bound to believe it. Now what difference is there between an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Jew, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated Papiſt?</note> Jew was bound to reſt upon the Authority of the Prieſts, (though they were Idolatrous, or infected with Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm,) he endeavors to invalidate my allegations of the Prophet <note n="†" place="margin">Eſa. 9. 16. Eſa. 8. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Eſay,</hi> who expreſſely ſayes in the place alledged, The leaders of the people cauſed them to err, and they that are lead of them are deſtroyed. Is it not evident, that leaning upon their leaders hand, and reſting upon their Authority was the peoples ruine? God therefore, not only to ſecure them from ſorcerers (as this man reſtrains the caution) but alſo from all ſeducers whatſoever, who ſurely would pretend divine warrant to gain credit to their erroneous doctrine (for never any one brought falſe doctrine upon the ſtage without a vizard) adviſes his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to have recourſe to the Law and the Teſtimony, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Miniſterie of the Prieſt and Levite, who were faithful in things concerning God, if any ſuch could be conſulted with (and ſome ſuch God did reſerve in the worſt times) but giving the people liberty, if the Grandees ſpake not according to that manifeſt Rule, to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61783:25"/>
diſbelieve them, as deſtitute of true Light. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet indeed doth not forbid men to reſort to the preſent Paſtors of the Church, but allows them the judgement of Diſcretion, to try the words of their leaders by the Law, which ſhines brightly enough to enlighten their eyes, that they may diſcern Chaff from Wheat, and falſe doctrine from true. Let the next Paper, if it can, ſhew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: for this offers nothing to that purpoſe. Till then, and for ever, the Law and Teſtimony written by Gods ſpecial deſign ſtand for a Rule of Paſtors teaching, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples obeying.</p>
                  <p>Next he brings 2 proofs of his aſſertion out of <hi>Deut. 17. 8. 12. Mal.</hi> 2. 4. The Devil could find Scriptures to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance <note place="margin">Deut. 17. 8. If there ariſe a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood &amp; blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween plea and plea; and between ſtroke and ſtroke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> his temptations. But Conſider the violence offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Gods word by this racking it. As to that of <hi>Moſes,</hi> there is indeed there an eſtabliſhment of a High Court without appeal, to whoſe cognizance are referred all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Controverſies about the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the whole frame of it divine, gives a tincture of Religion to thoſe cauſes, that were for the ſubſtance Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or concerned the outward eſtate or perſons of the people.</p>
                  <p>In that Court, the Prieſts and Levites, who by their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice were bound to ſtudy the whole Law of God, and fit to expound the political Statutes given by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> for the government of that Nation, but contrived, enac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and endited by God himſelf, did ſit with the Elders, as Judges. Now judg you, whether the ſubmiſſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of all Jews being at difference about civil matters to the ſentence of that Court, ſignify any thing to enforce upon Jews an obligation to believe and obey the Prieſts in all things, when common reaſon aſſured them, that their doctrine, practiſe, and injunctions were contrary to the Law of God? Submiſſion to the ſentence of a Supreme Court, (which was neceſſary for peace to put a period to contentions) did not oblige the party adjudged to believe the ſentence to be juſt, though the aggrieved party had
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61783:26"/>
no remedy till the judg of all the world appear to do right. That thoſe Judges did often turn judgment into worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, it is evident by the Prophets; and it is well known that that Court ſetled at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> having taken to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the power of judging Prophets, did very often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Lords true Prophets. Now what Maſter of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can ever fairly deduce from the outward ſubjection, which was neceſſary both for wrath and Conſcience to a Supreme Court of Gods inſtitution, though the Judges were not infallible in judicature, That thoſe Prieſts were infallible teachers of Religion, whoſe word was to be taken and relyed on without refuſal or ſo much as tryal?</p>
                  <p>As to that of the Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> it is ſubtilly done of him to touch it lightly, but fraudulently done to cite it imperfectly. It is enough that I have already ſhewed the full ſenſe of the Prophet, who declares what the Prieſts were by their office obliged to do, and from their Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Duty aggravates the crime of the debauched Prieſts of that age, who abuſed both their power and alſo the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And this ſharp reproof is far enough from proving them then to be infallible.</p>
                  <p>But this Queriſt ſurely preſumes you to be a Papiſt already, and of that form that is unlicenſed to read the Book of God. Elſe, he could not be ſo ſtupid, as to affirm that which any one but indifferently verſed in the Scriptures knows to be falſe. Or it may be (and that is very likely,) he himſelf is very little acquainted with the Bible, but borrows both his citations of Scriptures by halves, and alſo his Anſwers to them, that are commonly alledged by us, from his deluding Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. Otherwiſe how were it poſſible that a diligent reader of Scripture ſhould ſay, (mark his words) <hi>It was far from the Ordinances of</hi> Moſes, <hi>that every private believer had licenſe to peruſe the Scriptures;</hi> When no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more inculcated by God, and <hi>Moſes,</hi> then that parents ſhould learn, and teach their children the Law,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61783:26"/>
bind it about their arms, make Phylacteries of it, and by all means poſſible derive unto poſterity the Ordinances of God and the Hiſtory of his Providence, which are the ſubject of the Holy Scriptures. If it be ſaid, that all this they might do without Book, becauſe once in ſeven years, they heard the Law read, we muſt then allow the Jews quicker apprehenſions and more comprehenſive and tenacious memories then we have in our generations. But ſee the unpardonable ignorance or impudence of this croſs-grained Queriſt, who ſays the Law was to be read once <hi>onely</hi> in ſeven years, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 10, 11. Doth that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, which enjoyns the Law to be read in the <hi>Panegyris</hi> at the Feaſt of Tabernacles in the Sabbatical year, include a Prohibition of the Jews to read the Bible by themſelves, and to meditate in the Law, day and night, as occaſion ſerves, which is a bleſſed imployment, <hi>Pſaal.</hi> 1. 1, 2. Would <hi>Moſes</hi> deprive them of this happineſs? Or was that Statute broken by the Jews every Sabbath day, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as <hi>Moſes</hi> was read in the Synagogues, in every City, as St. <hi>James</hi> tells us it was the Cuſtome of old ſo to do? Mark then the Sophiſtry of this illiterate impoſtor, and <note place="margin">Act. 15. 21.</note> his companions; I ſay, Illiterate, becauſe he ſays, that paſſage of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the ſtory of <hi>Eſdras, Nehem.</hi> 8. 12, 13. was all, <hi>We</hi> (that is, Papiſts) read in Scripture of the common Peoples knowing the written word. Bleſſed be God that We Proteſtants may and do read more, that aſſures us, that the word of God did dwell plentifully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews, and ought to do ſo with all Chriſtians, without Buſhels ſet over the Light, as in the Church of Rome. Yet we do not affirm, that every <hi>Idiota,</hi> or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſervant of God could by his private ſtudy attain to the full meaning of every hard ſentence. None of us thinks this neceſſary, or poſſible. Yea, we make a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at leaſt, whether any High Prieſt, or Council, under the Old or New Teſtament ever fully underſtood all the things hard to be underſtood, or hard to be interpreted in the Law, and Prophets, or in the <note n="*" place="margin">

And it was a grievous fault in the deſpiſers of the riches of Gods Grace, that God had written for them the great things of his Law, and they were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a ſtrang thing. This Queriſt doth bewray his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance <note place="margin">Hoſ. 8. 12.</note> by another miſtake, of ſome conſequence in his deſign to make the <hi>Levites</hi> and People dependent on the High Prieſt for the ſenſe of Scripture. He ſays, <hi>Eſdras</hi> the chief Prieſt interpreted the Law to the <hi>Levites,</hi> and enabled them to expound it to the people. Indeed <hi>Ezrah</hi> was a Prieſt, and a perfect Scribe, by whoſe induſtry and Gods ſpecial aſſiſtance the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> were collected into one body of Oracles, which was in truſt committed to the cuſtody of the Jews. But not <hi>Ezrah,</hi> but <hi>Jehoſhuah</hi> was then High Prieſt, who <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 2.</note> no doubt was diligent in the diſcharge of his ſacred office, whiles <hi>Ezrah</hi> was active in interpreting, that is, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating the Law written in the Hebrew Language, which was well-nigh loſt with the vulgar in their long captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who were accuſtomed to the common ſpeech of the Chaldeans their Lords, and rendring it intelligible in their familiar tongue, and alſo in expounding and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law to their preſent uſe, and in aſſiſting the <hi>Levites,</hi> that they might be well inſtructed to perform their office of teaching the people. Now this work of <hi>Ezrah</hi> did much help, but not hinder or obſtruct the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people in their private ſtudy of the Law; and the uſe of their own particular judgment was fairly conſiſtent with the attendance on the publick Miniſtery, which was then ſincere and uncorrupted; but was not ſo throughout the whole courſe of the Jewiſh Politie. And for this reaſon nothing can be concluded from <hi>Ezrah</hi>'s age and actions to ſtrengthen the pretended Infallibility of the Jewiſh Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood for ever.</p>

Now the Jews indeed wanted the beneficial Art of Printing, and this defect made the Copies of the Law leſs frequent, then the Bible is now adayes. Yet ſuch was the zeal and diligence of pious men in that Nation, that the Law was not ſo rare a thing, as this man would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you. There was then no prohibition of the High Prieſt or Sanhedrim either to tranſcribe, or to tranſlate the Law and Prophets, or to read them in their Original, or tranſlated, no not in our Saviours Age, when he ſent his Auditors to the Scriptures, to ſearch for teſtimonies of him; when indeed it had been in vain for the people to have made their recourſe to the Scribes, Phariſees, Prieſts and Elders, who through ignorance of the Scriptures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Jeſus to be the Chriſt, and out of malice excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated all thoſe that underſtood the Scriptures better then themſelves, and by their light were led to own Jeſus to be the Glory of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> I hope you will apprehend this to be ſufficient to vindicate your title to the Scripture, and your power to uſe it according to that judgement of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, which every Chriſtian, that ſtands bound to give an account of his faith, cannot be denied, without uſurping a dominion over faith; the very ſuſpicion whereof, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> although he were truly infallible, yet <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 24.</note> did carefully decline.</p>
                  <p>The Queriſt treads the beaten path of Papiſts in debaſing the holy Scripture, and diveſting it of the fitneſs and power to be a compleat Rule, and an effectual inſtrument of faith, that he may make room for a new Quack: of which impious way to diminiſh the credit of Gods Word, I leave you, or any ſober Chriſtian that loves and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that invaluable pledge of Gods love, to make a judgement without my further cenſure. But give me leave to propound briefly ſome remarks of this Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. [Firſt I obſerve, that he often joyns the Rule and Means of Faith together, and confounds them ſo, as if they were one and the ſame thing. But the diſtinction of theſe two is of great importance to the preventing; or to the ending of frivolous Diſputes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:61783:28"/>
The Rule of Faith is that publick ſtandard of Chriſtian Religion, which includes things of belief and practice, both in the ſervice of God, and alſo in converſation with men. The adequate Rule of Faith for Chriſtians is the Word of God revealed by Chriſt, or the Goſpel which was firſt preached, and then written by the inſtinct of the ſame Spirit, <hi>(Rom. 10. 8. 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 25) The Goſpel in this ſence doth include in it the whole Scripture of the Old Teſtament, the divine Authority whereof it affirms, and confirms by the harmony of both. This Rule is one and immoveable, and ſo entirely delivered by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <note place="margin">Tertul. l. de veland. virgin. <hi>ſpeaking concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Creed;</hi> Regula fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei una omninò eſt, ſola im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mobilis, &amp; irreforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilis.</note> that it is uncapable of addition, and the attempt of addition or mutilation or any corruption makes the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifier of this Rule liable to a dreadfull <hi>Anothema</hi> denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 1. 8, 9. Now becauſe the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures in their fulneſs contain this Goſpel, therefore they are uſually called by the ancient Fathers both Greek and Latin, the ſtraight, unerring, unſwerving Rule of Faith, that can deceive none, and needs no correction. This Rule contains and like a Light holds forth the object of our Faith, and is not the leſs a Rule of Faith, becauſe this holy Scripture comprehends many other things of great uſe for our inſtruction and ſpiritual delight; as a Carpenters Rule juſtly carries that name, and ſerves the turn of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring ſtuff and work, though it be ſet out with ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and uſeful Tables.</p>
                  <p>You may now apprehend what we mean by the Rule of Faith. But the Means of Faith ſignifie another thing. For whatſoever by its nature and efficacy doth ſerve to bring man to the knowledge, right underſtanding, and full aſſurance of the ſaving Truth, comes under this Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Means of Faith. The holy Scripture as it conveys unto us the Goſpel, which it contains and preſerves, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a principal inſtrument of God to work that faith which is his gift. Moreover God hath in his wiſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World and his Church appointed many means, which according to the courſe of his providence contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61783:28"/>
to the working of faith in our hearts. There are ſome outward, whereof the chief is the publick Miniſtry, which is compared to a Candleſtick that holds forth the light to the houſhold of faith. And not only Paſtors are the means of faith, but alſo Parents, and Maſters of Families, and every good Chriſtian, which is, as Chriſt ſays of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in general, (for the twelve Apoſtles were not then ſelected out of the multitude) the light and ſalt of the earth, by communicating the Word unto others, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 13, 14.</note> often the happy propagators of the faith. Beſides men, ſome things, as Books, are inſtrumental to promote our knowledge and faith. There are ſome inward means of faith, as our ſenſe and rat onal faculties, in the exerciſe whereof if there be not an actual certainty allowed, the whole frame of civil ſociety will be diſſolved into confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the foundation of Religion will ſink, ſince faith is a reaſonable ſervice, and was firſt built upon their ſight which were eye-witneſſes of the Goſpel, and now comes by hearing, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 10. 17.) which two ſenſes are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 2. Act. 4. 20. 1 Joh. 1. 1.</note> of Diſcipline. Neither will I exclude Oral or Practical Tradition from being a means to propagate the faith. But this is ſo ſlippery a way, ſo changeable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, and liable to corruption, and forgery, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the ſuperſtitions of Heathens and Jews, for the divine Authority of all which Tradition was pretended, that without Scripture to ſupport it Tradition is too weak to hold up faith. Thus it appears that the Rule of faith can be but one, and it muſt be common to all, as the <note n="*" place="margin">Tit. 1. 3. Iud. v. 3.</note> faith and ſalvation are common, and it muſt have the unmovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble certainty of a Rock for man to build on. And this firmneſs you may call, if you pleaſe, Infallibility, for this property of God, who is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>(Tit. 1. 2. Heb.</hi> 5. 18.) can neither be deceived, nor deceive, is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to his Word, which is the Truth it ſelf, and therefore the Rule of faith. But the term, Infallible, is a Scholaſtical Novelty, which neither Scripture, nor the ancient Fathers uſed to attribute unto the Church; but
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61783:29"/>
now it makes ſuch a noiſe in the world with the inceſſant ringing of Papiſts, that it ſtupifies many mens ſenſes and underſtandings. But the Means of faith are manifold, which, where God himſelf by his Spirit manages them, are effectual to beget a ſaving faith, though many of them are far ſhort of Infallibility, though Papiſts in their confuſed way of talking require Infallibility in the Ground, Rule, and Means of Faith equally.]</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, Pray note his unproſperous fraud in the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Scriptures perfection and all ſufficiency to teach us the whole myſtery of godlineſs, without ſetting us to ſeek out elſewhere for a remnant of faith, or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Word. For he confeſſes the Scriptures to be a profitable, but a partial Rule, which contains many of the moſt important points of Religion clearly and expreſly enough, to ſatisfie any capacity, but wilful pertinacy; and for the reſt which are not thus expreſſed, it refers us to the Church, and the Governors thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For certain the Monarchy of the Pope, and the Infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are the fundamental ſtones of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Religion; and if they could be proved true, are of the moſt importance to the eaſe of conſcience and the peace of Chriſtendom in that ſluggiſh and ſervile way, wherein Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts would lead us: and therefore it is no wonder that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts who are true to their intereſt, contend earneſtly for theſe that are ſuch points, as being once admitted they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the reception of all other Doctrines whatſoever. Now let the Papiſts ſhew theſe two clearly expreſſed in Scripture, or ſhew us a good reaſon why the Apoſtle ſhould have a greater mind to tell the after-Ages of the Church of his Cloak and Parchments, then to inform them of thoſe points which according to their opinion are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to preſerve the Church in peace, eſpecially then and there when St. <hi>Paul</hi> had it in his deſign to recount all the grounds, motives, and means of Chriſtians keeping the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, and yet hath <note place="margin">Read Eph. 4. 3. to 14.</note> left out the Headſhip of the Pope, and the Magiſtery of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61783:29"/>
the Infallible Guide, the Roman Church. What reaſon imaginable can be given, why Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſhould not have an equal kindneſs for all the important points of Religion, and an equal care to conſerve their memory by writing? or indeed what need was there of writing any thing at all of particular points, when one Reference of us to the Church for all, would have ſerved the turn? would not one precept writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of, Ask the Church, that is the governors of it; or, inſtead of Search the Scriptures, Inquire for the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Tradition of Chriſtendome, have been convenient and ſufficient for our ſatisfaction in all points as well as in ſome? Ah, how palpable is the folly of vain and proud man, when he oppoſes the wiſdom of God? But when I ſeriouſly conſider what this man writes of the Scriptures referring us for the reſt of our Faith to the Church, or univerſal Tradition, I cannot but wonder at his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of your credulity, if you were bound to take his word; who offers no proof of what he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms.</p>
                  <p>But we ſhall juſtly conclude him to bely the Scripture, till he or ſome body for him produce ſome place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which expreſſely referrs us for ſome important points of Religion unwritten to the oral teaching of the Church, or to the univerſal Tradition of Chriſtendom. If this Queriſt be asked the Queſtion, Where hath Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made the partition of the Faith into the Word of God written, and the word unwritten, and ſet up a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to ſtand (as the Angel in St. <hi>John</hi>'s viſion) ſtood with the right foot on the Sea, and the left foot on the land) with one foot on the unſtable waters of Tradition, and <note place="margin">Apoc. io. 10.</note> the other fixed on the firm ground of Scripture, he muſt be as mute as the man without the wedding garment was.</p>
                  <p>But after all this pray obſerve, how irreconcileable this mans allowance of Scripture to be a Rule clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for many weighty points of Religion, is with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61783:30"/>
his Concluſion, That the ſole Rule general for all perſons and all points of Religion is univerſal Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whereas he ſpends time to oppoſe a Chriſtians receiving and knowing what he is to believe, what not, by his ſole peruſal of Gods written word, he fights not againſt any aſſertion of ours, but againſt his own <hi>Jackſtraw:</hi> we adviſe Chriſtians to make uſe of faithful guides as well as the light, and to learn the uſe of the Rule by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring with ſpiritual builders, that can inform them in the application of it, and not to neglect any meanes which God offers them for their conduct in the way of truth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The common Objections againſt the dignity and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Scripture, which Papiſts repeat, <hi>uſque ad nauſeam,</hi> to the Scandal of Chriſtianity, and the advancement of Atheiſm, are abundantly anſwered by the Champians of our Religion; to which I would refer you, if I did not know you able to diſcover their impertinency and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty together. But I will put you in mind, that the unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Proteſtants, if they depend upon the credit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, what are the words of Scripture, (when the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick that cannot read hears the Miniſter that doth, and may ask his neighbour that can read whether the Miniſter read right, and the ignorant may ask the learned, and the weak Chriſtian may ask the ſtrong, and all men by ſome means or other may be ſatisfyed of the words of Scripture being faithfully delivered unto them) are in no worſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then unlearned Papiſts, who depend upon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of ſurly (and very often ſilly) Prieſts, or intereſted Biſhops, for knowing what is the univerſal Tradition of Chriſtendome.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As to the learned, whom the Queriſt takes into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, I pray obſerve, whether the Scholars of both the oppoſite ſides do not diſſent as much about the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Tradition of the points in diſpute, as about the ſenſe of Scriptures urged on either ſide. If ſo (as you
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61783:30"/>
will be ſure to find it) then upon the ſame ground which this man layes as ſufficient for the removal of Scripture from being a rule, Tradition alſo muſt be caſhiered. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the learned Papiſts who differ about the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> do on either ſide urge for their defence univerſal Tradition.</p>
                  <p>If then it be not ſufficient to determine this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, why ſhould it be ſet up to juſtle Scripture out of its Seat to make room for another means of determining con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, which is as uneffectual, and indeed infinitely more unfit? If a Papiſt ſay, that the determination of this point is not neceſſary, (which is a groſs abſurdity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this remaining undetermined no ſmall part of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh worſhip of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as the Feaſt of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate Conception, hath no certain ground of Faith, and by the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſentence is Sin) we may with more reaſon ſay, that the determination of the points <note place="margin">Rom. 14 23.</note> in controverſie between us is not neceſſary: Or if it be neceſſary, that determination is to be regulated now, as the deciſion of things in diſpute was of old in the general Councils, by the Scripture, or written word of God, by which Tradition it ſelf is to be meaſured and judged; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> made the Scriptures the <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="6">6. [Becauſe here is frequent mention of Tradition, and the ambiguity of the word is apt to beget miſtakes; and confuſion therefore give me leave to unfold the Senſes of the word, that we may have a clear apprehenſion of the matter in hand. Tradition is ſometimes put to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the thing delivered, whether the way of delivery be writing or ſpeaking, and Tradition thus taken materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is indifferent to the being written, or unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: for the ſame Tradition, or Doctrine of the Goſpel which was at one time unwritten, might have been written, and for certain was at another time writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en.</p>

                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:61783:31"/>
And the Jewiſh Traditions, which for many genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions paſt by a ſucceſſive conveyance without Book, have been by the <hi>Rabbies</hi> committed at length to vvriting for their better Security. And the Papiſts now make no ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of vvriting their Traditions, vvhich they call the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvritten Word of God; (let them juſtify the preſumption as vvell as they can). Novv as the Traditions of the Elders mentioned in Scripture ſignify the doctrines and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <note place="margin">Mat. 14. 2, 3, 6.</note> that vvere delivered by the Fathers; but vvere diſtinct from the Law vvritten: So when vve ſpeak of Traditions in the Chriſtian Church; vve do now in theſe latter ages commonly underſtand ſome particular do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines or Rites or matters of fact delivered with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of divine or at leaſt Apoſtolical Authority for their reception, which are not expreſſed in the written word of God.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Traditions once accepted and commended by the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Conventicle at <hi>Trent,</hi> hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeverely enjoyned to be received and embraced with an equal affection of holy reverence, wherewith we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayn the ſacred Scriptures themſelves. But to keep up the myſtery of iniquity with the liberty of laying aſide old Traditions, and giving credit to new inventions; as their intereſt and occaſions may require, they who determined the Canon of Scriptures, and numbred the Books; yet would not reckon up and determine the Traditions of the Church, that Chriſtians might know what is the perfect and fixed Rule of Faith.</p>
                  <p>Thus Romaniſts, though they have a larger Object of Faith, then we have, yet they have no certain meaſure; becauſe the Traditions of the Roman Church are like the Moon ſubject to decreaſes, (as the giving of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt to Infants was once held by D. <hi>Innocentius</hi> 3. as a Doctrine of Faith, and a Tradition of the Church; but <note place="margin">

Chriſts reaſon together with the refutation of Phariſaical Traditions confirms the Truth of this Rule.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whatſoever is obtruded upon us under the pretext of being a Tradition, that is neither clearly delivered in, nor fairly by good conſequence deduced out of Gods written word, needs not, and ought not to be received as a matter neceſſary to Salvation. The manner of conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, or neceſſity, wherein things which are ſtrangers to Scripture are held, is carefully to be taken notice of. For ſeveral practiſes have been in early times introduced under ſhew of conveniency (as the Apoſtle ſays, ſome bodily exerciſes carry a plauſible ſhew of wiſdome) which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once obtained credit by the favourable commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of eminent perſons and cuſtome, have been in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of time adorned with the Title of Tradition and grown up from being thought convenient to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and preſt as neceſſary to Salvation. This danger is to be prevented by circumſpection. And the perfection of Scripture as it is a compleat Rule of Religion proves the truth and uſefulneſs of this ſecond Rule.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Doctrines of Faith and divine Worſhip being ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Gods written word from intruſions of humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions: if any Rites or Ceremonies can be proved by fair Teſtimonies of Antiquity to have been practiſed by the Church univerſal of primitive times, and are ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by the Authority of Church Governors as tending to edification, or the free and open profeſſion of our Faith, whether they be called Traditions or no, are not lightly to be rejected; much leſs violently oppoſed by private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61783:32"/>
Thus much for Traditions, as meaning Matters of Religion delivered down from former times to poſterity.</p>
                  <p>But Tradition often bears another ſence, and is taken formally for the manner of conveyance of matters that concern Religion, which is partly oral partly practical. The joynt agreement of Doctrine and practice continued by ſucceſſion of one Age after another, whilſt one genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion derives to another the whole body of Religion, is now called Tradition, and of late is aſſerted by Papiſts in this Kingdom to be the only Principle and Rule of Faith, and affirmed to be of its own nature infallible and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and to be evident by its own light. And thus the order of inquiring for the ancient dayes and old wayes is quite inverted: for now we need only (as they teach) mark what the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, and becauſe Tradition cannot fail nor vary, therefore the Popes Court at this day, with the Church, Altars, Pictures, Wafers, mangled Euchariſt, adoration of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Angels and Saints, offering of a real Sacrifice for Souls in Purgatory, and offering of the Maſſe to God for the honour of Saints, is a true Glaſſe, wherein you may ſee the face of the Church when St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſate Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> This is the aim of the Queriſts Diſcourſe to ſet up this Tradition inſtead of Scripture. If you will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, you may chooſe, becauſe he tels you plainly it is not his work to prove any thing. But I will give you a little touch of proving the vanity of this pretence. The experience of all Ages before the flood, after the flood, in the Jewiſh Nation, and in the Chriſtian Churches, doth manifeſtly ſhew, that the derivation of Religion from mouth to ear, from hand to hand, from Fathers to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, from Prieſts to Succeſſors, from Age to Age, this courſe of Tradition, which is oppoſed unto and preferred before the Scriptural way of preſerving and propagating and recovering of Religion, hath been and may be quickly corrupted, often interrupted, and hath ſuffered notorious changes, and may do at any time, when ſloth, and ſenſuality,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61783:32"/>
and neglect of the light, and vanity of mind ſet forward by the Devils malice and cunning make men weary of the true Religion. But I will add another Argument to another pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. St. <hi>Paul</hi> by word of mouth taught the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.</note> what he thought not expedient to write, to wit, what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Man of ſin from being revealed. Here was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of conſequence that concerned the Church delivered by word of mouth, which if it had been written as well as that Character of the Man of ſin, the fame Scripture, which preſerved and conveyed the one, would have alſo ſecured the knowledge of the other to poſterity. If now an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Church failed in deriving one point of Doctrine to after Ages, which with little difficulty might have been kept and taught, but is now loſt for not being recorded in Scripture, what likelihood is there, that the whole body of Chriſtian Religion was, or could be traduced entire and pure meerly by oral Tradition, without dependance on the Scripture, for 1600 years? For my part I think ſtill, that as the Church of the Jews were either more or leſs pure, and their Religion more or leſs Houriſhed in truth and ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the Governors gave heed more or leſs to the light of the Law written; in like manner according to the degrees of Paſtors attendance to the holy Scriptures the Tradition of Chriſtianity hath varied. Therefore the Scriptures are the only fixed and ſtable Rule of Religion.]</p>

                  <p>Now to the mans concluſion; He acknowledges that a direct fit and true anſwer to my Queries <hi>(mutatis mutandis)</hi> would be an anſwer to his captious queſtions, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds with the ſame mind, as his admired Maſters the Scribes and Phariſees did trouble our Saviour Chriſt with Interrogatories, thinking (but in vain) that we ſhould be intangled in our ovvn Anſvvers, whereas indeed he had been catched, if he had given appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Anſwers. But after mine examination which I reſign up to your diſcretion, I deſire you to transform your ſelf by the power of imagination for a while into the perſon of a well-minded Jew, that ſeeks for ſatisfaction in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a diſtracted eſtate of the Church, and try whether this Queriſt being forced to turn Reſpondent hath fully and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered my Counter-Queries.</p>
                  <p>My next Task is to examine his exceptions againſt my Categorical Anſwers. I ſhall not contend about words, nor much crave excuſe for want of accurate expreſſion in that haſty delivery of my Conceptions to comply with your requeſt at that time.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt, he excepts againſt the term <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> as dubious to make my Anſwer acceptable, I will inſert the Term he deſires, and ſay, <hi>True Chriſtianity.</hi> But I fear the addition will diſpel no miſt of doubtfulneſs, if there were, any ſuch about the anſwer. For Hereticks alwaies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Truth as much as to Chriſtianity; and would be taken for the only true Chriſtians. But to ſatisfy his nice and curious palate I anſwer as fully as he deſires.</p>

There was, is, and ſhall be till the worlds end, a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, that in every age is viſible by profeſſion of true Chriſtianity to the perſons then living. That is to ſay, In all ages God had, and will have and preſerve ſome Chriſtians, who ſhall ſo profeſs the Truth according to the doctrine of the Goſpel, that their light of Faith ſhall ſhine to the men of their generation reſpectively.</p>
                  <p>But I cannot ſo eaſily admit another addition ſliely made by the Queriſt to my Anſwer, <hi>viz. in their whole profeſſion.——Latet anguis in herbâ.</hi> He that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 12, 13.</note> true Chriſtianity may build hay and ſtubble upon the foundation, and yet not miſcarry in his perſon, whilſt he holds faſt his profeſſion of the ſaving truth unto the end, though he be ſaved through the fire, and looſe his ſuperſtructure, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us. It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary that any perſon, or Church which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains true Chriſtianity, ſhould profeſs it in ſuch an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute purity, as that water ſhould never be mixed with the wine. It is enough, that poyſon is not admixed with the liquor of life.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe I perceive, that there is much ambiguity in the termes of the Query, for which it deſerves to be called <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacia plurium interrogationum,</hi> a ſophiſtical trick of asking many things under one word, that hath two faces under a hood, I will weigh the vvords over again, and mould my anſwer anevv, fitted to his explication of the vvord <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</hi> In common ſpeech <hi>Catholick</hi> is no more-than Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal: <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> vvho vvith many others of that age <note place="margin">Just.

                     </gap>, the Catholick or in plain Engliſh Univerſal Reſurrection. There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a Catholick Faith, vvhich is common to all Chriſtians and compriſes all that is neceſſary to Salvation. And the Church of Chriſt novv unconfined to any one place or nation; but ſpreading like a fruitful vine her branches throughout the earth is called <hi>Catholick</hi> that is not Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; as the old Church of the Jevvs vvas, but Univerſal,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61783:34"/>
ſince the Goſpel is preached to all the vvorld indifferently, and the voice of the Apoſtles vvent forth into all the earth, <note place="margin">Col. 2. 6. Rom. 10. 18.</note> and their vvords unto the ends of the habitable vvorld. It is not to be omitted that in a ſecondary and borrovved ſenſe the word <hi>Catholick</hi> is applied to them that hold the true Faith which is common to all Chriſtians and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Catholick. In this ſenſe not only a particular Church, but alſo a ſingular perſon may be called Catholick, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one that profeſſes the Catholick Faith. But the Queriſt who hath a peculiar language, and though he ſpeaks En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, yet means Italian, hath taught me ſince I firſt read his Queſtions, and anſwered them according to the common uſage of the words, that he meant by the Catholick Church the Repreſentative Church in a full and lawful meeting of the Prieſts and Paſtors to teach the Church diffuſive. Now according to this ſenſe of the words, <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> I do turn my Affirmative Anſwer into a Negative, and ſay; There is not in all ages a viſible Catholick, Church, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a general Council lawfully aſſembled. If this be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation, you ſee who teac hes me to be double tongued.</p>
                  <p>The exception againſt my ſecond Anſwer is, that I add the word, ordinarily, and he ſuppoſes that I might mean, that ſome may be ſaved in extraordinary caſes out of the viſible Church, and therefore he takes my Anſwer to be Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative; That ſome may be ſaved out of the Catholick Church, and this he thinks is contrary to the ſtream of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. If he had not had the malignant diſpoſition rather <note place="margin">Mage cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, quam aut Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, aut Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daurius. <hi>Horat.</hi>
                     </note> then the quick-ſighted eye of a Serpent, he would never have eſpied a fault in my Anſwer, and fancied an Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſentence in a Negative Propoſition. For if he had not been forward to cavil, he might have eaſily conceived a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obvious reaſon of my putting in the word <hi>Ordinarily.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know not how God will deal in judging all out of the pale of the Church, and we that live within it are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to give an account onely for our ſelves, and for the uſe of our Light and Talent, I ſaid that, Ordinarily out
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61783:35"/>
of the Catholick Church there is no Salvation. This nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which reſolves nothing poſitively concerning Gods extraordinary acting cannot without unjuſt violence to my words be taken for an affirmative ſentence, That ſome may be ſaved out of the Church. And I hope, you will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, if not juſtify, my unwillingneſs to limit the ſpirit and mercies of God, which blows and ſhine where God pleaſes. As for Chriſtian Antiquity, you know that many antient Doctors have been very favourable in their judgment, not only of them who lived by the law of nature in a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, when the Covenant of Grace was firſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with the Hebrew Patriarchs, though thoſe worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>But according to the Queriſts explication of the Church Catholick, I ſhall now change the ſhape of my ſecond An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer alſo, and ſay; That Chriſtians may attain ſalvation out of a Repreſentative Church, which he gives to be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Catholick Church in the Querie, and charges me with ſophiſtry becauſe I will not underſtand it ſo. The members of a general Council being but few, (and that not agreed, who have right to be ſo) it were hard with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, if all who are <hi>extra Concilium,</hi> out of that compaſs, were excluded out of Heaven. I add, that the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick may ſtand, and all the members of it may be ſaved without a Church Repreſentative.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe all that he ſays is but beating the Air, and very impertinent to his deſign of making a Convert, (which is the thing aimed at) I add a Propoſition, which though it be not a direct Anſwer to his Queſtion, yet it ſhall ſtrangle or ſtifle his intended Concluſion in the conception, and it is this;</p>
                  <p>A Man may be a member of Chriſts body (which we now call the Catholick Church) and be in the Ark, out of which there is no Salvation, though he be not in communion with the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61783:35"/>
chief Governors of the Roman Synagogue. Let him deny <note place="margin">Read the Bul. of P. <hi>Pius</hi> 4. which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns all Clergy-men, and all in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Orders to ſwear to the new Creed whereof this is one Article. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Roman Church the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Miſtreſs of all Churches.</note> this, if he dare make an open forfeiture of his charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let him diſprove it, if he can. There was a viſible Church, and Salvation attained in it, before there was a ſtone laid at <hi>Rome</hi> of a ſpiritual Temple, (for. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the mother and Miſtreſs of all Churches, and not <hi>Rome,</hi> as the Father of lies teaches Papiſts to ſay and ſwear) and it may be ſo again, when <hi>Babylon</hi> the great; the City ſeated on ſeven hills is fallen as a milſtone caſt into the bottom of the Sea. In the mean time, the old poſition of Dr. <hi>Jo. Reynolds</hi> is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Remembrance, The Roman Church is neither the Catholick Church, nor a ſound member of the Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p>My Anſwer to his third Querie is very magiſterially, but ridiculouſly cenſured by him to have nothing of a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical Anſwer. The Propoſition is for certain Categori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, becauſe it is not hypothetical: Let the Queſtion and the Return be compared, and this will appear defective in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing neceſſary to an Anſwer. The demand is this,</p>
                  <p>I deſire to know by deſignation, which, amongſt them all which pretend to be the Catholick Church or a part of it, is now the Catholick Church:</p>
                  <p>The Anſwer runs thus; That is the Holy Catholick Church which profeſſeth that one Holy Catholik Faith, once for all delivered to the Saints, <hi>&amp;c. ut ſupra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſays, I give no deſignation of any particular profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or profeſſions of Chriſtians: That is to ſay, (if I miſtake not his meaning) I do not name Proteſtants, or Papiſts, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of <hi>Greece,</hi> or of <hi>Germany.</hi> Indeed if I had ſo done, I had then given an Anſwer, that could not ſatisfie any rational man. For no Church deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from the place of habitation, (which way of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Churches is uſual in Scripture) or from ſome bond of union, which is not general to all Chriſtendom, can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and truly be called the Catholick, that is the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church. But I that was at liberty to deſign it as well as I could, did give a ſignificant Character of the Catholick
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61783:36"/>
Church taken from its proper office and action. The Queriſt ſays, I tell what the holy Catholick Church is. Very good. But I do not deſign which of ſo many ſeveral profeſſions in the world is now the Catholick Church. Now if he expect that I ſhould play the fool, and ſay that a particular Church is properly the Catholick Church, I hope you will not be offended if I do not ſatisfie his expectation. And when I have deſigned the Church Univerſal ſo, that a man may underſtand what it is, I think with the ſame labour I have told him which is it, becauſe the Church Univerſal is but one; as he that tels what the Sun is, deſigns which is the Sun, becauſe there are not many Suns. And becauſe the Church is a collective body, that is, one by aggregation of ſimilar parts, each of which leſſer Societies is called a Church, I have given him a Mark whereby he may know, whether any particular Society be a member of that Body, ſince the one faith runs through the one body, and is the life of that body and of every limb of it. But my fault is, that I deſign one obſcure thing by another that is equally obſcure. I will mend my fault, if I do not juſtifie my ſelf from having committed one. I confeſs all ſpiritual things are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure to men that are meerly carnal or natural, but where the Goſpel ſhines, if it be attended unto, it brings light with it, whereby we may diſcern things that differ. For judging or diſcerning of a true Church from a falſe, we muſt firſt know in ſome meaſure what is Truth. For if we muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 16, 17, 18.</note> a good tree from a bad by the fruit, as our Saviour di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us to do, then we muſt firſt know what is good, and bad in fruit, and then conſider what fruit the tree bears, and from thence give a judgement of the tree. This is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, which we muſt take in the enquiring for a true Church. Till we know what is Truth, (and that is <note n="*" place="margin">Thy <hi>(ſcil.</hi> Gods) Law is the Truth, Pſal. 119. 142. Gods Word is the Truth, Jok. 17. 17</note> the Faith once delivered to the Saints) we cannot know what Church brings forth good or bad fruit. Profeſſion of faith is bearing of fruit. The goodneſs of this fruit is Truth, that is, agreeableneſs to the Word of God. It is therefore neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that we know the Truth, before we can know a Church
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61783:36"/>
to be true. Now though the Truth, or the holy Catholick Faith may be under doubt, and debate, yet hath God ſet it up in the Scriptures ſo conſpicuouſly, that if the Goſpel be <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 3.</note> hid, it is hid to them that periſh. Therefore I added to the Character of the Church by which I deſigned it to be known, that is, the profeſſion of faith, the means whereby we may know what the faith is, which being profeſſed is the ſole certain mark of a true Church. For the marks of the Church which Romaniſts commonly give are ſeparable from the Truth, and if they be taken ſingly without truth are falſe and treacherous <hi>indices,</hi> whereas the true faith of it ſelf is a ſure note of a true Church. And I pointed at Scripture, which is the Rule of faith, on purpoſe in mine Anſwer, that I might not be thought to ſend a man to look for a thing in the dark without a light. And now Sir do you judge, whether I have deſerved blame by my deſignation of the Catholick Church by profeſſing the Catholick Faith. But to make mine Anſwer both applicable to the Queſtion, and alſo uſeful to you, I ſhall a little explicate and enlarge my ſence. It is preſumed, that the enquiry after a Church is made by a Chriſtian, that may be diſtracted in the variety of viſible Societies differing one from another; but every one equally pretending to be a Church; but his diſtraction is the greater, becauſe of all Societies, only the Roman Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue doth challenge to her ſelf to be the Ark, out of which there is no ſalvation. There are three Reaſons which may move Chriſtians to enquire for a Church, or a viſible Society of Chriſtians: 1. That they may ſerve God, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up the ſpiritual ſacrifices of praiſe and prayer by Chriſt Jeſus. 2. That they may grow in grace and the knowledge <note place="margin">Heb. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15. 1 Pet. 2. 5. 1 Pet. 3. 18</note> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. 3. That they may joyn with Gods people, and keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace by communicating together in Gods holy Ordinances. To compaſs theſe ends a Chriſtian is not concerned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire where the Catholick Church is, for it is confeſſedly diffuſed through the Nations, but ſo ſpread by Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the light, that the Sun of righteouſneſs doth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61783:37"/>
not at one time ariſe to all parts of the world. Beſides, the Candleſtick is moveable from any place, and the Kingdom of God may be transferred from one Nation to another, neither hath God by any the leaſt indication of his will <note place="margin">Apoc. 2. 5.</note> and pleaſure encouraged any portion of mankind, or part of the world, to promiſe to themſelves a perpetual eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Church in that place and in that ſucceſſive body of men, which at ſome time hath been, or is now irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated with the Goſpel. It is therefore not at all material to trouble our ſelves with delineations of the Catholick Church which hath no ſet or certain limits of extent. That which concerns us to know, is what Church pretending to be a member of the Church Univerſal (for no men but Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that can admit contradictions into their Creed, will ſpeak ſuch non-ſenſe, with deliberation, as that is, when they call a particular ſociety of Chriſtians combined un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Biſhop the Univerſal Church) is fit and ſafe to be communicated withal, that we muſt reap the benefits of a Chriſtian Congregation. Therefore the Queſtion is now, whether the Church, wherein I was born and baptized, and by Gods Providence am ſeated under its government, or another different ſociety of Chriſtians which invite me to their communion, be ſuch a company as I may ſafely joyn with them in all publick offices of Religion. For if it be, I am bound to communicate with that Church as being a member of the Body of Chriſt, the unity of which Body I am bound to maintain.</p>
                  <p>The Truth therefore of the doctrine taught, the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and purity of the divine worſhip celebrated, and the way of adminiſtring Eccleſiaſtical power muſt be examined by ſome Rule, and known to be agreeable to the Goſpel of Chriſt, before a Chriſtians conſcience can be ſatisfied of the neceſſity of communion with that Church upon this account, becauſe it is a member of a Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. Since then it is the cuſtome to call any publick ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſtians, that are compacted together by a frame of political government into one body, a Church, that
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61783:37"/>
particular Church is a member of the Catholick, which holds that Faith, the profeſſion whereof conſtitutes the Church Catholick. He that ſleights this Deſignation, would have dealt kindly with us, if he had diſcovered unto us, a better way, or a clearer Light by which we might find the Church, and diſcover a true Church from a vain pertender. Till he or ſome other do that office for us, we think it beſt to ſeek for a Church, if we were now to ſeek, by looking for the light of truth in it, which alwaies ſhines in the houſe of God. And becauſe truth and peace are both the legacies of Chriſt bequeathed unto the Church, we may do well to try what ſociety of Chriſtians doth follow peace and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body of Chriſt. If the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that ſets up Images of God, (which are the teachers of lies) in their Temples, and by her <hi>Anathemaes</hi> makes diviſions in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, be tryed by thoſe two marks; I leave the event to any one, that will impartially pronounce ſentence accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the evidence of fact in the whole bulk of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Devotions, and in their publick Government.</p>
                  <p>My fourth Anſwer hath the ſame fate with the former, to be called not Categorical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I muſt learn new Logick, as well as new Theologie, to underſtand this <hi>Gentleman.</hi> But it is charged with defect, becauſe it reflects not upon the whole Queſtion, and takes no notice of the tail, wherein the ſting of the <hi>Scorpion</hi> lies. I confeſs mine Anſwer comes ſhort in that particular; becauſe I did not apprehend then, the laſt clauſe of his queſtion to be of any moment. For I thought it enough, that the Church Catholick is ſecured from any error that is deſtructive of Salvation. But becauſe I am now informed, that the main force of the Querie lies in this, <hi>Whether the Holy Church ſo deſigned can teach any error as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith endangering of Salvation;</hi> I now make a return to that part, as well as to the former; and indeed to the whole Queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Errors that endanger Salvation do not alwaies deſtroy it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God hath promiſed to preſerve his Church from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; but not from danger.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:61783:38"/>
3. All errors when they are diſcovered are to be rejected.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. No doctrines offered by any Church to her Children are to be received without examination.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Catholick Church as it ſignifies the whole Body of Chriſtendome is too big to be a teacher, that may be conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and hearkened unto.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Church in this mans ſenſe and explication, that is, an Aſſembly of chief Paſtors in Council may teach errors en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering Salvation. <hi>Arianiſm</hi> hath been taught in as large Aſſemblies of chief Paſtors, as the true Faith hath been.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But becauſe it is the deſign of this man, that we ſhould take the Roman Church for the Catholick, I ſtick not to ſay that the Roman Church teaches her children errors that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the attaining of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>My fift Anſwer is excepted againſt for the interpoſition of theſe words, <hi>[so long as it continues ſo]</hi> which looks like a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <note place="margin">5.</note> and ſeem to ſuppoſe that the Catholick Church can ceaſe to be ſo. The words are capable of another conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> The Holy Catholick Church ſo long as it continues ſecured from teaching deſtructive errors cannot even for that reaſon abuſe the world with forged Scriptures. This was then my meaning, who had no intention that my laſt Anſwer ſhould contradict my firſt.</p>
                  <p>Let us now ſee, what he draws from my Anſwer, if it were Categorical, and how rational his inference is. For now we are come to the bottom of his project. And he thinks he hath catched us ſo faſt in his trap, that either we muſt give him the Cauſe, or be condemned out of our own mouths.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If mine Anſwer be,</hi> (ſays this new faſhioned Logician) <hi>that the Church can never ohtrude falſe Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then you muſt grant that the Catholick viſible Church is infallible in the delivery of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If ſo, then is there an infallible Judg upon the earth concerning this point.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How raſh this inference is, and how incoherent the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion with the premiſes, a few words will ſerve to diſcover. It is acknowledged on both ſides, that the primitive Church, which received the Scriptures was not, and becauſe Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61783:38"/>
guided and governed the Church in this important buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, could not be abuſed and miſtaken in the receiving of Canonical Scripture. The Catholick Church being quickly after enlarged, and ſpred through many regions of the earth did together with the Goſpel preached receive Copies of the Scriptures, which had been communicated by the particular Churches, to which they were directed at firſt, unto their neighbour Churches. Theſe Scriptures were by all Churches reverenced and preſerved as the Grand Charter of their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the Laws and Records of their Society; as the Church was the Kingdome of Chriſt diſtinguiſhed from the world. The zeal of Chriſtians for their Laws, and their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of them, which were frequently read in the publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, according to an * Apoſtolical order, to which we muſt add above all the Providence of Gods watching over the <note place="margin">Col. 14. 16.</note> Church for the preſervation of Scriptures, being more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to God than to Man, and as pretious to God as the world it ſelf, theſe being well conſidered may aſſure us, that it was morally impoſſible, that the whole Church of God ſhould be couſened into the reception of any forged Scriptures. And if the Church in following ages could not combine together to coyn counterfeit Scriptures, then the Church univerſal could never obtrude any thing upon the world for Canonical Scripture which was not received from the Primitive Church at firſt. But how doth it follow from hence, that the Church is an Infallible Judg in this point? A creditable witneſs is not preſently an Infallible Judg. A faithful Depoſitary that keeps Records is not the ſame thing with an unerring Judg. The Tradition of the Church Univerſal, which hath derived the Holy Scriptures from age to age, is not an Act of Judicature. The Nation of the Jews is at this day a credible witneſs of the divine Original and authority of the Old Teſtament, at leaſt at the firſt plantation of the Church Chriſtian, the Jevviſh Church did preſerve and deliver the Holy Scriptures intire (ſo much at leaſt as God thought neceſſary or expedient, and if any book vvere loſt, that by being loſt became unneceſſary) and vvas ſecured by Gods Providence in the conveyance of his Oracles to Chriſtians. Doth it hence follovv that the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61783:39"/>
People of the Jews was a viſible Infallible Judg in that point and if ſo, then in all matters of Faith? For thus the Papiſt proceeds.</p>
                  <p>If ſo, I require ſome ſatisfactory reaſon (ſays the Queriſt) why the Church ſhould be infallible in this, and fallible in other points of Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have already ſhewed that the Caſe is not ſo, as this man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines; therefore I am not bound to give him the ſatisfaction which he requires. Yet for your further information, I add this: 1. The reception and tradition of Scriptures by the Church is a fact which God orders as expedient for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Religion. 2. The certain number of the Books written by inſpiration is not a point of faith neceſſary for every Chriſtian to know and believe unto Salvation. 3. The Catholick Church cannot err in any point of faith neceſſary to ſalvation. 4. But any particular Church may believe and teach erroneous Doctrine for matter of Faith. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (which is not the ſole keeper of Scripture) may and doth err in ſeveral points of their Religion, and doth impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her children uncanonical Books for Scripture, and falſe Doctrines for matters of faith, as is evident by the Canons of the Conventicle of <hi>Trent.</hi> And yet it is not in the power of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to abuſe the whole Chriſtian world by the impoſition of counterfeit Scriptures upon it. I ſhall yet perſiſt in my reflexion upon the Jews, that I may ſhew that the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Scriptures without forgery, falſification, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a thing diſtinct and ſeparable from erring &amp; teaching errors. The Jews cannot be denied to have been good keepers of the Books, even then when they corrupted the Religion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by the Law written in thoſe Books. Never yet was any man ſo weak, as to conclude that the Prieſts and Rabbies of the Jews were Infallible Judges of the Doctrine concerning the Meſſias, even thoſe who condemned Chriſt the Son of God to be guilty of blaſphemy and worthy of death, becauſe they kept the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. There is now leſs reaſon why we ſhould take the preſent Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which we evidently ſee to teach Doctrines and ſet up a worſhip as contrary to the Scriptures as darkneſs is to light, to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61783:39"/>
Judge of faith upon this account, becauſe the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Roman Church in communion with other Churches did hand down to poſterity the holy Scriptures, without any fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſification, ſince the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day doth both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and impoſe upon her own Children, and would but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not upon others, Apocryphal Books for Canonical.</p>
                  <p>I have now ſhewed that theſe Queries are not unanſwerable by Proteſtants adhering to their own principles, or Axioms. I deſire you to conſider the reſult of the whole deſign: Except you allow him at firſt that the Roman Church is in propriety of ſpeech the Catholick Church, this diſquiſition can advance you not an hairs-breadth to a better opinion of the Roman Church for a Guide, then you had before. For after all the clamour made for reſolution of theſe Queries concerning the Catholick Church, the main Queſtion ſtands as it did, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this day be to be ſubjected unto, as an infallible Guide, and to be communicated with, all other Churches being abandoned, and particularly the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whereof you are now a ſetled member. Till this be reſolved, you that know the frame of our Church and the module of our Religion may ſtay ſafely where you are.</p>
                  <p>It remains now that I examine his Anſwer to my conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Querie. And I ſhall briefly note, what you may by your own reaſon or experience diſcover either abſurd, or falſe in it.</p>
                  <p>He doth not require you to deſert the Reformed Church of <hi>England</hi> for adhering to the Scriptures as the Rule of Faith: For the Roman Church doth that as well as the Proteſtant, as he ſays. If this Queriſt do not pretend to Infallibility and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over you, he will out of modeſty allow you to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether Papiſts do as well, that is as fully and firmly, adhere to the Scriptures as Engliſh Proteſtants. Certainly they do not well own them for a Rule, who accuſe them of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity and imperfection, and make it a point of faith, that the defectiveneſs of Scriptures muſt be ſupplied with unwritten Traditions. And as certain it is, that we who maintain the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Scriptures in delivery of all things neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the perſpicuity in that delivery, and therefore admit
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61783:40"/>
of no point of Religion that is a meer ſtranger unto the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, do more cloſely ſtick to that Rule, then the Papiſts. But becauſe you are free to examine the adherence of Papiſts to the Scriptures in particulars by compariſon with the Engliſh Proteſtants, try whether a mangled Euchariſt, the real Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt by a Prieſt that makes his Maker and eats his God, The publick ſervice of God in a forreign and unknown language to the generality of the people that muſt ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to all, Pictures of God uſed in Religious worſhip, the ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive worſhip of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Invocation of Saints, Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, the eaſe of departed ſouls by offering of Maſſes, the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of Bels, the treaſury of ſuperabundant merits of Chriſt and holy perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be as agreeable to the Scriptures as our Liturgy, and the 39 Articles agreed on in our Church. If you find it otherwiſe, and Papiſts do not ſo much as pretend to make Scripture the Rule of theſe Doctrines and practices, what credit can be given to ſuch an impudent boaſter?</p>
                  <p>But the ground of deſerting us he pretends to be this, That we will have the ſole Rule of faith to be the Scriptures in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of Univerſal Tradition, and the voice of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Suppoſe the chief Paſtors and Doctors of <hi>England</hi> ſhould diſpute in the Schools about the Rule of faith, and exclude Tradition and the voice of the Church from that honour which they think due only to the Word of God in Scriptures, now ſince the deceaſe of the Apoſtles, and the unhappy divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Chriſtians, that make it difficult, if not impoſſible to know aſſuredly, what is delivered by Univerſal Tradition, or taught by the Catholick Church; why muſt you upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, (or any man) deſert the Church of <hi>England,</hi> where the worſhip of God through Chriſt Jeſus is celebrated without any mixture of ſuperſtition, and the means of ſalvation are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to you in a ſufficient meaſure for your conduct in the way of truth and peace? Let a Papiſt, if he can, prove that our making Scriptures the ſole Rule of faith makes the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with our Church unſafe. Muſt you needs run out of our Church, as if it were a Houſe viſited with the Plague, meerly becauſe it relyes only upon the Scriptures for a Religion? And
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61783:40"/>
if you muſt do ſo, muſt you needs then at the next ſtep run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Roman Aſſembly, that (as my Lord <hi>Falkland</hi> ſpeaks) keeps her children from Scripture, as a Mother would keep her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from Rats-bane? Think of both theſe, becauſe the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman will not be pleaſed, if you deſert us, but will not come to them. He will think himſelf ſtill a loſer, if any water go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Mill.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This calumny thus impudently faſtned upon our Church ſhews this Queriſt to drive the Devils trade ſeveral wayes, in tempting by impoſtures, and in falſly accuſing the brethren. For I challenge any Papiſt to quote (if he can and will cite an Author faithfully and fairly) any Article of Religion, or Writing of a Biſhop, or ſentence of an Academy, wherein we diſclaim Univerſal Tradition, or the voice of the Catholick Church. For mine own part I do openly profeſs, that if any point in controverſie between us and Papiſts can be proved to have been taught by the Primitive Church as a matter of faith, and derived by the voice of the Catholick Church from age to age, and this Univerſal Tradition be manifeſted by as good evidence, as is uſually produced for the divine original of the Scriptures which we receive for Canonical, I will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that Doctrine as the Word of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>SIR,</hi> you cannot but know, that we conſtantly reject many of the Popiſh opinions, obtruded upon the Chriſtian world, as Novelties, which not only want a ſufficient war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the Scriptures; but alſo cannot be made credible and acceptable by Univerſal Tradition. Such are the Popes Univerſal Biſhoprick, or Occumenical Headſhip, (which Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the great called the character of Antichriſt) the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and many other points of Popiſh Religion, ſome whereof I recited above, and need not repeat. We have inceſſantly required the Advocates for the Papacy to prove the conſent and conformity of the preſent Roman Church in theſe particulars with the Primitive Church, whoſe voice is the Precentor in the Quire, and the firſt circle in the diffuſion of Univerſal Tradition. Thus, let due eſteem and credit be given to Univerſal Tradition, but you ſee how little it is in earneſt valued by Papiſts, or how
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61783:41"/>
far they are from making uſe of that Rule, (which they extol ſo zealouſly as you hear) thereby to prove the truth of their religion. In fine, you may apprehend the No reaſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the Reformed Church of <hi>England</hi> therefore, becauſe ſhe makes the Holy Scripture the ſole Rule of Religion, when indeed ſhe knows no other given by God to the Church, and looks upon Univerſal Tradition whenſoever it appears fair and full with reverence, as being the ſenſe of the Church.</p>
                  <p>He proceeds to abate the force of my diſſuaſive of you from entrance into the Roman Church, when the condition of your entrance is the renouncing of your ſenſes, reaſon, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For the two former, though the terms ſeem hard, yet his rigour abates nothing of them. You muſt be contented to loſe the uſe of your ſenſes and reaſon, when you become a vaſſal to <hi>Rome.</hi> To mitigate the ſeverity, he tells you, this is no more than Scripture and the Proteſtant Church requires. He abuſes Scripture in two inſtances.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He ſays, was not <hi>Lot</hi> to deny his ſenſes, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them to be Angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay no, and the Scripture doth not ſay any ſuch thing as this man ſuppoſes. When God thought fit, either to appear himſelf to the Patriarchs in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſhape clad with fleſh in a tranſitory manner, (which is generally taken to have been a <hi>Praeludium</hi> of the words, or the Son of God his incarnation) or to ſend Angels inveſted with humane bodies, the ſervants of God, to whom thoſe heavenly meſſengers were ſent ſo fitted for converſe, were not bound to renounce their ſenſes; but by their reaſon, and their knowledge of Gods way of enter courſe with his choice ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants by Angels, they were to regulate the notices of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which their ſenſes repreſented unto them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He cries out, How could our Saviour paſs through a croud of People, and neither be ſeen, heard, or felt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a deception of the ſenſes? Judg, I pray; whether it ſuits with the Faith and Reverence we owe to Chriſt, the truth it ſelf, in his Perſon, Doctrine, and Actions, to aſcribe unto him the deception of the Peoples ſenſes, which comes very near to the practiſe of <hi>Magicians,</hi> and will if admitted diminiſh the credit of Chriſts Miracles. Our Saviours paſſage through the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61783:41"/>
multitude ſo, that he eſcaped their fury, and left them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, might be wrought many wayes, which we are not concerned to imagine, and muſt not determine though we could deviſe, becauſe the Goſpel hath not recorded the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it. But it is raſhly and irreverently ſaid to be effected with a deception of the ſenſes. But how is Chriſts action at that time an obligation laid upon Chriſtians to the worlds end, to deny their ſenſes in the Euchariſt, where Chriſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the material objects of our ſenſes to be the inſtruments of our faith, and the Bread and Wine are deſigned to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Symbols of ſpiritual things even as the Water in Baptiſm is? Briefly, ſince our Bleſſed Saviour, the Angels and the holy Apoſtles, have made our ſenſes competent inſtruments to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt <note place="margin">L. k. 24. 39. Joh. 20. 27. Mat. 28. 26. Act. 10. 41. &amp; 1. 9. 1 Joh. 1. 1, 3.</note> our faith and reaſon in judging of the truth and preſence of Chriſts Body, even after the Reſurrection, and Chriſt hath not any where by himſelf or his Apoſtles limited the free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of our ſenſes, nor leſſened the credit of their Verdict in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt more then in Baptiſm, is it not a horrid tyranny over Chriſtians, to require that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce both ſenſes and reaſon, and at the command of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Prieſt believe that there is no Bread and Wine, where all our ſenſes (almoſt<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>) conſpire to inform us of their preſence, and the very nature of the Sacrament requires it; and on the other ſide to believe that Chriſts Body is in every conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Hoſt, and in every crum whole and entire, and continues one, though divided from it ſelf in a million of places, when our ſenſes can give us no information of this preſence, and our reaſon aſſures us that it is inconſiſtent with many Articles of our Creed? But obſerve the confidence of this Factor, who with a fore-head well rubbed tels you, that Proteſtants, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you to renounce your ſenſes; whereas we think that our Saviours command, <hi>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear,</hi> holds <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 9. Apoc. 2. 9.</note> by proportion in the reſt, He that hath eyes to ſee, let him ſee, with aſſurance, that the God of truth, who fitted man with ſenſes for the ſervice of his Maker as well as for his own bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, doth ſecure him from deceit in the uſe of them about their proper objects, in Religion as well as in civil converſation.</p>
                  <p>As for our Reaſon, this he would perſwade you muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61783:42"/>
in the belief of the Trinity, that you may renounce it for the eaſie ſwallowing the Camel of Tranſubſtantiation. Think what advantage this man gives to Heathens, Socinians, Anti-Triniarians, and indeed all the adverſaries of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, by confeſſing, that the prime Article of our faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the God whom Chriſtians worſhip is more oppoſite to reaſon, then the ſcandalous Monſter of Tranſubſtantiation. The Doctrine of three Perſons in one God is indeed a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime myſtery, which is beyond the diſcovery of reaſon before it is revealed, and incomprehenſible by reaſon after revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as many ſecrets in the very courſe of nature cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for by our dark and narrow underſtandings. Reaſon it ſelf tels us, that the infinite nature of God is not to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the limited being of the creatures, and alſo that the glory, of the inviſible God cannot be diſcovered but by his own manifeſtation of it, and that according to his own good pleaſure with different degrees of light, as Gods wiſdom thinks fit to impart unto man the knowledge of God: And laſtly, Reaſon reſolves that Gods Word, eſpecially of himſelf, who like the Sun is ſeen by his own light, is to be believed without diſpute. Since therefore God in his Word written hath clearly revealed that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt are one God, it is a kindly office of enlightened reaſon to bring down every vain thought and weak reaſonings that lift up themſelves againſt the knowledge of God, and to lead them captive under the obedience of faith. But there is no cauſe, why we ſhould ſtruggle with our reaſon, and un-man our ſelves, that we may admit the diveliſh figment of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, whereof there is not the leaſt ſhadow in the Word of God. This ſubtil Sophiſter aggravates the difficulty that may be fancied in the Trinity to the greateſt advantage of Atheiſtical cavillers, but he would leſſen the abſurdities of Tranſubſtantiation by an imperfect and falſe repreſentation of his own Doctrine, which hath no ground in Gods Word. All that is with any colour alleadged out of Scripture to give countenance to the lie, which we are required to believe, is <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 19, 20.

Where is this Converſion recorded in the Goſpel, or Apoſtolical Epiſtles, that we ſhould offer violence to our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to work our minds to the belief of it? It is alſo falſe, that you are required only to believe that Bread is turned into Fleſh. We do believe, and that without renouncing our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that Chriſt who could turn ſtones into Bread, and did turn water into Wine, could turn, if he pleaſed, Bread into Fleſh, and Wine into Blood, as eaſily as he did Water into Blood in <hi>Egypt.</hi> And if Chriſt ſhould do this at any time, the change would be as evident to the ſenſes, as it was in all mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous converſions, and the Fleſh would be as viſible, as the Serpent was into which <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod was turned, and the Blood as truly obvious to the eye, as the ſanguified ſtreams of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But Papiſts require your unreaſonable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of another thing, to wit, that the Sacramental Bread is turned ſubſtantially into the very Body of Chriſt which was before that born of the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and is now at the time of every converſion ſitting at the right hand of God in glory above the Heavens. By the way, (becauſe it is not my buſineſs now to refute this falſe Doctrine) remember that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Axiome of true Philoſophy, Nothing is before it is made, or whilſt it is in making. But Chriſts Body was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sacrament, and is already when the Prieſt begins the firſt ſyllable of his Magical murmur, by which he pretends to make the Body of Chriſt. You ſee the manifeſt contradiction, which you are obliged by Papiſts to believe in this inſenſible converſion.

the matter again, when he ſpeaks of the eaſineſſe of believing that one Body is in more places at one time. I know that <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas</hi> in his <hi>Quodlibets</hi> ſays that the ſubſiſtence of one Body in more places at one time is impoſſible, becauſe that which is one in it ſelf cannot be divided from it ſelf without the deſtruction of its unity and being together.</p>
                  <p>But that is not all which you are bound to believe in this device: For you muſt believe, if you can, that the very Body of Chriſt which conſiſts of limbs and lineaments diſtinguiſhed by ſeveral proportions and ſituations, and at this time is now in a certain place in Heaven, clothed with glory brighter then the Sun, is now lurking, an inviſible and indiviſible Body, in all the Hoſts that are conſecrated, or inchanted rather, in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, and in every crum of every Wafer. This is the ſubſtance of the Popiſh Doctrine, which the Sophiſter rarifies into a thin cloud but that hath ſtill groſs contradictions in it, which are enough to divert a man that would ſerve God with his reaſon and underſtanding from going into the region of darkneſſe, that is the Roman Church. <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1 1 Cor. 14.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>He would fain repair the breach which is made in their Charity. Here his jugling is unſufferable. He conceals the uncharitable condition of your admiſſion into the Roman ſociety. To joyn with Papiſts, you muſt break off communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with all Chriſtians that are not ſubject to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> Can you leap over this ſtumbling ſtock, and think your ſelf in a ſafe Sanctuarie when you have ſhut up your ſelf in the Popes cloyſter from converſe with all Chriſtians beſides in offices of Religion? But all our complaint of their unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs, he ſais, is our miſtake. You have read enough of that argument. I need ſay nothing now.</p>
                  <p>But ſee how untowardly this wolf puts on the Sheeps skin on his back. He thinks their Charity unreproveable, becauſe they (as he ſhameleſly affirms) cenſure not Perſons, but Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and that maintained pertinaciouſly. Read the Canons of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> wherein this is the conſtant form of curſing their Adverſaries, <hi>Si quis dixerit,</hi> If any perſon ſay ſo and ſo, let him be <hi>Anathema.</hi> And have not Armes been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed after that the <hi>Anathemaes</hi> were thundred, to extirpate
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61783:43"/>
with fire and ſword the doctrine of the Goſpel by deſtroying the perſons that profeſs it? What truth can you expect from ſuch open lyers, as the men of this mould are?</p>
                  <p>He ſays further that neither Papiſts nor Proteſtants can ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely Judge, who maintains an error obſtinately. Where then is their Charity, or Juſtice, when they do (as the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Chriſtendome ſufficiently witneſs) adjudg Proteſtants to be Hereticks, and ſo render them up to the ſecular arm to be ſlaughtered, as the Executioners of Papal decrees think fit?</p>
                  <p>But the Papiſts do ſo abound in Charity, that it is only out of Charity that they endeavour our converſion by warning us of dangers. I will believe that Romaniſts ſeek our Souls Salvation, more than Engliſh money, when out of meer Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they ſeriouſly undertake the converſion of the Strumpets in the Popes Dominions, who are in as great danger of being damned, as thoſe whom they call Hereticks can be by their profeſſion. But they that are the Popes creatures dare not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their Charity to the impoveriſhment of the Popes Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, to which the licenſed Stewes afford no ſmall contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution. Neither will theſe charitable ſavors of Souls allow us the ſame exerciſe of our Charity in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> although we are as firmly perſwaded of the danger, that Papiſts are in, as they are conceited of our perils, and have as much pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and kindneſs for poor Souls kept in bondage and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in ſpiritual Aegypt, as Papiſts have for us. Till we can obtain the ſame freedome for us to employ our Charity, it is not agreeable to juſtice that Papiſts ſhould be permitted ſuch liberties as they now take to make an oſtentation of their counterfeit Charitie, which is indeed carnal Policy to reſtore the Papal juriſdiction in <hi>England,</hi>

                  <p>He proceeds in his falſhood, and denies the profeſſion of Faith expreſſed in the Pope <hi>Pius</hi> 4. his Bull dated <hi>A.</hi> D 1554: to be a new Creed. Do you not take that to be new, in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, which is but a little above a hundred years old? for the whole maſs which is ſuperadded to the antient Creed of the Church was never known for a Creed till that Pope gave it out for one.

               <hi>Therefore when Chriſt bids them keep and do what the Scribes and Phariſees ſay, whiles they ſit in the Chair of</hi> Moſes, <hi>he ſpeaks not of their own doctrine; but of that of the Law and of</hi> Moſes. <hi>For it is all one as if Chriſt ſay; All thoſe things, which the Law and</hi> Moſes <hi>have told you, when the Scribes and Phariſees recite them, do ye keep and perform; but do ye not according to their works; as</hi> Hilarie <hi>and</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome <hi>ſeem to have underſtood the Text.</hi>

               <hi>Mark, that this learned Papiſt is conſtreyned by the force of truth, and uncontrollable evidence of the falſe doctrines of the Scribes and Phariſees, to imply tacitely that thoſe Chairmen could teach a Doctrine far different from that of the Law and of</hi> Moſes, <hi>and openly to averr that the Doctrine of the Law and</hi> Moſes, <hi>(that might then be well known) was to be the Object, and limit of the Obſervance and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence enjoyned, as due to the Miniſtery of the Scribes and Phariſees.
