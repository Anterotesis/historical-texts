            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO ALL THE Friends to Truth in the Nations.</head>
            <p>DEar Friends, I am Commanded of the Lord God to lay a few things before yon, charging you in his <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Dread</hi> to weigh and conſider them.</p>
            <p>THis is <hi>an Hour</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> of <hi>Tryal</hi> upon <hi>all,</hi> and is not a Time for <hi>any</hi> to be <hi>looking abroad</hi>; It is <hi>high time</hi> for the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of every <hi>Individual</hi> to be gathered <hi>Inward; Stayed minds will now be found more needful than ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Grand Deſign</hi> of the <hi>Enemy</hi> is, <hi>To draw you out</hi>; and doth ſuit <hi>his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Baits accordingly</hi>; Knowing aſſuredly, that your <hi>Strength,</hi> your <hi>Peace,</hi> your <hi>Safety,</hi> your <hi>Redemption,</hi> indeed your <hi>All</hi> lies in your ſingle being ſtayed in your Minds <hi>in the Light,</hi> and in your <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Sincere Obedience</hi> and <hi>Subjection</hi> to the Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of That, to the proper meaſure <hi>of that</hi> in every <hi>Individual</hi> or <hi>Particular Veſſel</hi>; If he can <hi>but lead you out</hi> from <hi>That</hi> in more or leſs, in ſo fat <hi>he gains his point,</hi> and you ſo far <hi>ſtrengthen the hands of the Enemy,</hi> and you are ſtruck <hi>in your very Vital parts,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if in any meaſure your Minds be joyned to <hi>that Thing,</hi> whatever it be <hi>you have ſet up an Idol of Jealouſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore all dear hearts, in the LIGHT watch <hi>over</hi> the <hi>hollow-nature, over</hi> your <hi>Thoughts, Words</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi>; every one keeping <hi>in their proper Sphere,</hi> ſingly given up <hi>in all things INWARD</hi> and <hi>OVTWARD, Fearing and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi> eſpecially <hi>in this Day</hi> to admit of a <hi>Thought,</hi> a <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Action</hi> to paſs you withont <hi>examining in the Light,</hi> how far <hi>it is owned</hi> by the <hi>Infallible Witneſs</hi>; and if it will not ſtand there <hi>shut it out,</hi> and <hi>let it alone,</hi> if there be any Doubt concerning it.</p>
            <p>Dear hearts, I have <hi>in the Eternal ſeen,</hi> that <hi>the Enemy</hi> hath much entred, in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Application</hi> of that which goeth under the name <hi>of our own Freedome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay again, this is <hi>an Hour</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and <hi>the Enemy hath entred</hi>; And I ſay (<hi>in the Dread</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Power of the living God</hi>) hath leavened many; and the <hi>Seed</hi> hath been and <hi>is</hi> burthened <hi>in many Particulars,</hi> and in <hi>one another</hi>; The <hi>World</hi> hath entred, <hi>Self</hi> hath entred, the <hi>High-mind</hi> hath entred: <hi>Singleneſs, Love, Integrity, Tenderneſs, Bowels,</hi> have been eaten out. <hi>Judgings, Evil-Surmiſings, Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fearings</hi> with one anothers work; ſo that even <hi>Diviſions</hi> with an Open Face hath entred as it were; Yea, and the Servants of the Lord God have been <hi>diſcouraged,</hi> and <hi>their hands weakned,</hi> in that which they have been particularly <hi>employed in</hi> from the Lord God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I ſpeak what in the Infallible I ſee and know,</hi> I Judge no man; All <hi>Judgement</hi> is committed <hi>to the Son</hi>; every <hi>Individual</hi> is to <hi>ſtand-faſt</hi> in that <hi>Liberty,</hi> to admit of <hi>no Judgement</hi> but what is <hi>from the true Judge</hi>: To ſhut out <hi>the Accuſer,</hi> any thing that would take <hi>that Office</hi>; And indeed the <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>that</hi> is to juſtifie <hi>the Guilty,</hi> and condemn <hi>the Innocent,</hi> both at <hi>Home</hi> and <hi>Abroad</hi> (feel me) And therefore I do <hi>in the Name</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the Lord God <hi>Charge every Individual,</hi> ſhutting out all <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, Conſulations, Juſtifications, Accuſations,</hi> that they may come under the <hi>Single View</hi> of the <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Inſallible Judge,</hi> the LIGHT in the Conſcience; that every One may in that ſee, how far the <hi>Execrable thing</hi> hath entred any of you, in any of the afore-mentioned <hi>Evils</hi>: For I do ſay, <hi>In the Fear &amp; Dread of the Almighty,</hi> that I have ſeen <hi>his Fury</hi> ready to break forth <hi>for theſe things</hi>; Yea, his <hi>Jealouſie</hi> that burns <hi>like Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore let none be <hi>stout-hearted,</hi> let all <hi>sink down</hi> to the <hi>Witneſs</hi>; for whatever <hi>ye be,</hi> it is your ſtation to <hi>dwell there,</hi> and not <hi>to look out</hi>; and <hi>in that</hi> you <hi>ſhall</hi> ſee the <hi>Innocent Cleared, Juſtified,</hi> and <hi>Judgement</hi> brought upon the head of the <hi>Tranſgreſſor,</hi> that in every Veſſel the <hi>Tranſgreſſor</hi> may be <hi>Sacrificed</hi>; there may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>preſerved</hi> that muſt be <hi>broken down and ſhut out,</hi> that the <hi>Oppreſſed</hi> may be <hi>delivered,</hi> the <hi>Dear</hi> and <hi>Pretious Vnion</hi> of Friends <hi>preſerved,</hi> the <hi>Reproach</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> taken away, and who have been <hi>overtaken</hi> in an Infirmity (<hi>through the Deceit or Violence of the Enemy</hi>) may <hi>be reſtored</hi> with the Spirit of <hi>Meekneſs, Love</hi> and <hi>Tenderneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Friends, Know that the <hi>Weight</hi> of theſe things have been <hi>upon me,</hi> and I have been <hi>preſſed under them.</hi> I am even <hi>bowed down.</hi>
