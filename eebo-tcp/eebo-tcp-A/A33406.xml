            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <body>
                  <p>DEar Sons, whom now thy Engliſh Den of Hereticks deſpiſe, who now are by them made the <hi>Ludibrium hominum,</hi> who for all your cunning ſtratagems and heroick Plots and Treaſons, and all your learning, yet (to my ſorrow I ſpeak it) you are likely both now to be driven out from, baniſhed, and utterly diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe <hi>Hgonots</hi> (ſilly Souls:) yet I your old Father, before I take my leave of the World and of you, which if Hereticks ſtill purſue to ſpit out their Malice againſt you my Sons the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and if as is reported the Penal Laws be put in execution againſt you, will ſuddenly put a period to this my now uncomfortable life. Yet ſtill me thinks I ought not to deſpair, but wait to ſee our Halcyon days, and Hereticks be again brought under the rod of our holy Inquiſition. You know Sons how I have erected Seminaries, and to what end; which my enemies do call bad Conventicles, no better then Cockatrices to hatch treaſon: in theſe I never thought any Coſt too dear, whereby either to make your Bodies fit for travail, or to help your natures inclination with fallacious art for the accompliſhment of our purpoſe. And now my Sons 'tis high time that you fall from contemplation to practiſe, or elſe I ſay all is loſt: for Proteſtants give out that Popery has ſeen its beſt days in <hi>England;</hi> and I hear the Parliament, that Pope-marring Aſſembly, will drive you like Foxes into corners: nay, I am informed that Heretick-like they have publickly burnt the effigies of my Holineſs; and that D. S. a leading man among theſe Hereticks, hath charged us with, nay not only charged, but proved that Catholicks are Idolaters; and that they make no more of confuting Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> then drinking of a glaſs of Wine. Ah now what is become of all our ſubtilty? we are now begirt about with our Father the Divils deviſes. Now therefore ſeeing it is thus, let none of you ſcorn your Old Fathers directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for though your younger years be riper in Art, yet my experience
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31517:4"/>
may teach you what in great deſignes is to be affected. <hi>Engliſh</hi> you are, whoſe <hi>Albion-Cliffs</hi> have heretofore ſeemed to my predeceſſors and me like Rocks of pure Diamond, where ſome have rightly loved us, and from the depth of their affection have embraced you my deareſt Children: but the greateſt part now purſue me with deadly hatred, terming me no better than a blood-ſucking <hi>Canni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> a Robber of Churches, a Patron of Hereſies, a Father of Falſehood, the Broacher of Quarrells, the Seed-man of Sedition, the Infringer of Liberties, the Controler of Princes, the Enemy of Chriſt, the Monſter and Aſtoniſhment of Nature, in Chayeing Chriſtians Souls in miſerable Thraldom, and more then Egyptian ſervitude.</p>
                  <p>But we expect the time when theſe Clouds may, nay will va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh: be not diſcouraged; you know after a ſtorm comes a calme, after Perſecution liberty; the thoughts of which is unto me as it were a Reſtorative, to revive my faint and languiſhing Spirits: which hope doth chiefly depend upon your cunning in compaſſing; and cunning conſiſteth in this which followeth: Firſt, that you work upon ſuch as are fit to be added to our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick faction; and ſecondly, in the manner of the performance. Thoſe that are the likelyeſt to be fitted to this frame, that is, to lend a hand when opportunity ſtrikes allarme (I ſpeak not ſons of thoſe who already are devout Catholicks, earneſtly expect, and heartily pray for ſucceſs in our Cauſe) either are Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents whom envy or malice may make deſirous of a change; or looſe profeſſors, who have lent their love to voluptuous delights or prodigalities, Children whom extreme want hath made deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately minded; or wanton wanderers, whom long travail hath deprived of natural affection.</p>
                  <p>And thus began <hi>Mahomet</hi> to ſtrengthen his State, by joyning himſelf with the angry Souldiers of <hi>Heraclius,</hi> ſtirring up their minds againſt the Emperor, and encouraging them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; whereupon in proceſs of time it came to paſs, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though many could not abide him, from the baſeneſs of his Birth, and odiouſneſs of his former Life; yet growing from a Thief to a ſeditious Souldier, and from a ſeditious Souldier to be Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of a Rebellious hoſt, his Mahometical force began to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due mighty people. Now as you muſt ſtrike with <hi>Mahomet</hi> while the Iron is hot, and work thoſe with diligence whoſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31517:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
inclination you find pliable; ſo muſt your wiſdom appear in the manner of this work, wherein I would have you to propound to your ſelves the deceitfulneſs of the damned wretch before named.</p>
                  <p>I would not for all the world it were known, my Sons, that you followed ſo baſe a pattern of a cozening Knave, for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of imitation: this <hi>Mahomet,</hi> not only to gratifie his Companions, but alſo the more eaſily to allure all Nations, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all Religions; the pertinacy of <hi>Arrius,</hi> the error of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> the vain invention of the <hi>Thalmudiſts:</hi> therefore from the Jews he received Circumciſion, from the Chriſtians ſundry waſhings as it were Baptiſm, and with <hi>Sergius</hi> denyed Chriſt his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to inlarge his Kingdom, he made ſuch Laws as were fit to win and allure the vileſt; as to his <hi>Arabians,</hi> baſe wretches, accuſtomed to live upon ſpoil, he alloweth Theft, and ſetteth a Law for revenge: hurt him which hurt you; he that killeth his enemy, or is is killed by him, entreth into Paradice: he permits of having many Wives, Divorcement for trifling cauſes; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth Paradice to them that give liberally, and fight for his ſake.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, miſtruſting his fall, with many Bulworks hath he fenced his Law, that no way be open to ſubvert it; Firſt, by commanding to kill them which ſpeak againſt his <hi>Alcoran;</hi> Secondly, by forbidding men to confer with a contrary Sect; and thirdly, by prohibiting credit to be given to any of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Religion.</p>
                  <p>Now Sirs, why ſhould not we prevail as well as this deceiver, whom for example I have mentioned to you my Children? have not we as many Motives, as plauſible Rhetoricians to perſwade? for Firſt, as he to allure all Nations received all Religions, ſo I your Old Father have found out ſuch a Religion as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of all ſorts, that all might be pleaſed; and therefore our Enemies have called it the Cruſe and Budget of hereſies. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, our Doctrines are as mighty to prevail, as ever were the Laws of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> If Old Men be covetous, their young men voluptuous, Nobles Ambitious, and the common ſort Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; we have ſuch allurements as are alſo to win them: to the rich covetouſneſs, with Craft and Cruelty, and the reſt of her
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31517:5"/>
factours, we have Coyned a Purgatory, the fire of our gain: to <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eed the voluptuous, our Religion admits ſimple Fornication, and our practiſe hath erected Stews: to draw on the Riotous, diſſolute and idle do-nothings, we have ordained many odd Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days; at <hi>Rogation</hi> to carry Banners, after <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> to go about with <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> play, and other knick-naks: nay, to encourage you in Treaſon or deſperate undertakings, we have canonized <hi>Garnet,</hi> and other zealous Catholicks, who ſuffered Martyrdom for the Catholick Cauſe, after that heroick, and of all good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks to be commended, though unfortunate Powder-Plot. To keep men from the ſight of their ſins, we have taught them to mince them, and that the firſt motions are no ſins unleſs they go with conſent, that ſome are venial, and need but an Aſperge of Holy Water, or a Biſhops bleſſing: to win ambitious hearts, that fain would be aloft, you muſt teach that my power is to give Kingdoms to ſuch as can conquer them, and to diſcharge Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance and Loyalty, as our <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth and <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth did againſt that Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick (though to all the world and to us our ſelves known moſt Virtuous) Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Further, we give immortality to ſuch as can pluck the Crown from the Princes head; and tell you that (which is a moſt damnable lye, but no matter ſo long as the Catholick cauſe is advanced) to murder a Hugonot, or blow up at a blaſt an Heretical Parliament, are works meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious.</p>
                  <p>If the people will know nothing, to fit their humours we teach that <hi>Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion,</hi> That <hi>Images are books for Lay men,</hi> That <hi>knowledge of the Scriptures makes Hereſies;</hi> and not as that Heretick Dr. <hi>S.</hi> teaches, that the Scripture ought to be the Rule of our Faith, but that it is ſufficient that their faith be folded up in our Church-belief, without underſtanding or knowing what it is. Again, to pleaſe the multitude, and to draw them to our Side, we have holy Reliques (Oh moſt pretious!) Diſpenſations, Indulgences, and thouſands of years of Pardon; and that Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes muſt believe not what Chriſt and his Apoſtles have taught, but what the Church believes, right or wrong; and that they ought to pin their Faith upon the fallible Infallibility of her, and not as Dr. <hi>S.</hi> affirms, upon (that heretical dangerous Book) the Scriptures, which have made Hereſies, as wiſely ſaid that Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31517:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when it was enquired how ſo many Hereſies came into the world: <hi>Why,</hi> ſays he, <hi>we may think our ſelves for it alone: for bad we kept that dangerous Book the Bible in an unknown Tongue, theſe Hereſies had never ſprung ſo thick; but now every private and Lay heretick puts his expoſition upon the Scriptures.</hi> And was not this anſwered like himſelf, think you, my ſons? Yea certainly: for now we finde it, to our woful experience.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, leſt ſimplicity either in Church-Service or Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacraments ſhould breed contempt, we have added many more petty matters to make them more commendable, more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the palat, and our followers more devout; as in our Churches gilded Images, Altars, Super-Altars, Candleſticks, and ſuch-like: In our Maſſings and Church-Service, Golden garments, coſtly Colours, ſtrange Geſtures, warbling and numbering of Beads, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In our Prieſts, ſquare Caps, Bald Crowns, great Hoods: In our Orders, Croſſing, Anointing, Shriving, ſorſwearing Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, <hi>&amp; e.</hi> In our Baptiſm, Waſhing of hands, Salting, Spawling, Exorciſing, Croſſing: In Receiving, to come with beards new ſhaven, and an imagination of a bodily and real preſence; which makes Catholikes devoutly to receive, when they are taught and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally think it ſo, but in truth none is, but as the Hereticks own my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically ſo to be. And laſtly, leſt this our jugling ſhould be eſpied, which I your old Father hear begins to be too manifeſt, we have made as ſtrong Fences for Papiſm, as ever did that wicked Beaſt for Mahometiſm. For firſt, we have endeavoured to bury the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, leſt by that light all our Projects, obſcure deſignes and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould be diſcovered; which if ſudden care be not taken, I have reaſon to fear it will too too ſuddenly. Yet fear not, the Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is fain many times to follow his Game long before he can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; the Angler is fain many times to ſit whole hours by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ſide, before he can perſwade the ſilly Fiſh to ſnap up their own deſtruction. We have waited long, and many of our well deſign'd and heroick Plots (ſuch as was the Gun-powder-treaſon) have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carryed: but there may come a time when—</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Church-ſervice we have thruſt upon ſilly people in a ſtrange language; Sons, you know well why: for' <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was never detected, before Chriſt was preached in <hi>Samaria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, we have forbidden our followers to confer with the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31517:6"/>
                     <hi>Hugonots:</hi> for they are always ſtriking at us with the Scepter of the Word, and ſtill cry, <hi>To the Law and the Teſtimony,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Further, we tell you, that any thing, though the horrideſt Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or Treaſon you ſhould act, is highly meritorious, ſo that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Catholike Cauſe may be reſpected, and the intereſt of our Church (I mean, that you may fill your own Coffers) advanced: and that as amongſt the <hi>Scythians</hi> he was reputed the braveſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that ſpilt moſt bloud; ſo I tell you, he is Canonized for the worthieſt Catholick, that can bring moſt ſouls to confuſion.</p>
                  <p>And now, what can we do more? Yet what doth there elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, but that you uſe all diligence, feeding your favourites with ſtrong hope and large promiſes, ſtanding at the Court-gates with <hi>Abſalom,</hi> the lively image of Courtly Politicks, ſeeming to pity the peoples eſtate, when his ambitious humour did greedily aſpire after his Fathers Kingdom. Even ſo you my Sons, tell them that their Religion is good, and how I your Father and theirs do pity them, and that if I had the diſpoſition of the Crown, plenty ſhould follow the Scepter, and peace ſhould follow plenty. I ſay no more unto you, but walk cloſely, and keep your ſelves <hi>in tenebris:</hi> For your predeceſſors, I know not whether to aſcribe it to angry Starrs, the influence of the Heavens, neglect of opportunity, want of ſecreſie, by too great ſecurity, have had ſo bad ſucceſs, that inſtead of ſupplanting a Kingdom, they have broke their Necks at Tyburn; and inſtead of reconciling Souls to the Romiſh faction, they have united their Heads to a Halter; this cruelty have they ſuſtained for my ſake, whom therefore I have Crowned with Martyrdom, and Queſtion not but that they have as good rewards as they deſerved. Thus hoping and expecting to hear the downfal of Hereticks, I am your tender (though by <hi>Hugonots</hi> deſpiſed) Father</p>
