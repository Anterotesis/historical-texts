            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OR
A Letter mentioned by Mr Love
upon the Scaffold, &amp;c.</head>

               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Understand that Mr <hi>Love</hi> in his Speech upon the
Scaffold, a little before his death, amongst other
things, made mention of a certain Letter, sent
unto him the night before he should have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted
the last Moneth, which he called <hi>an insulting
Letter,</hi> importing a resolution in some to publish in
print several things reflecting dishonor upon him after
his death: The truth is, the Letter he spake of was
written by my self, and his jealousie of <hi>any mans writing
concerning him after his death</hi> had its rise onely from a
marginal note of the said Letter, which it seems made
a deep impression upon him; and since his death I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that not onely Mr <hi>Love,</hi> but some of his friends,
did take that Letter very ill at my hands, especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that deep sense, pity and compassion that did (as
they say) seem to appear in me towards him in his sad
condition but a little before that Letter was sent, which
was (I confess) so great, that as on the one hand, I could
not be well satisfied how the Parliament could in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and Conscience have vouchsafed him a Pardon,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65037:3"/>
(they being indeed not their own but Trustees for the
Commonwealth, and therefore obliged to pursue the
publique and common benefit in saving or destroying
him (his life being forfeited to the Commonwealth,)
and no probable, much less certain <hi>publique</hi> advantage
appearing to accrue from his Pardon, but rather <hi>a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
up their cause</hi> so maintained and assetted by him
during all the time of his tryal; and nothing appearing
to the contrary in all his <hi>post addresses,</hi> how ever slily
and cunningly couch'd and pen'd;) so on the other hand
my bowels and affections did so melt and yearn towards
him that I verily beleeve I could have been contented
<hi>in Gods way</hi> to have parted with one of my limbs for his
life; and however I <hi>was</hi> by him and <hi>am</hi> by others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
mistaken in that letter; yet God and mine own
Conscience do witness for me the uprightness, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and singleness of my heart and spirit, out of which I
wrote it, for the spiritual peace and advantage of his <hi>soul,</hi>
had he been pleased to have improved it to that end, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as I conceived, very <hi>genuinely &amp; naturally</hi> improvable
thereunto; And mine own Family can bear me witness
(which I would not mention but upon this occasion)
that with many prayers night and day, I did, according
to my poor measure, importune the Almighty for grace
and mercy for him until the time of his death. The
truth is, I was plain and clear with him in my Letter,
applying my self to him in such matter, which I
thought might be most healthful and profitable for
him; It is now about eleven years sithence my first <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance</hi>
with him, in which time I have had very many
advantages, by a strict observation of him &amp; his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in publique and private, of inspection, as into his
worth and excellency (whereof he was always suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65037:3"/>
sensible,) so into his weakness and infirmities
(for I hope they were no worse,) and I found (and it
was not onely my observation of him, but also many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
for alas it could not be hid) that he was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
apt, not onely to be <hi>courted,</hi> but even <hi>captivated</hi>
with that secret, close, and dangerous lust and sin of
<hi>popularity,</hi> affecting multitude of followers, and not
able to bear opposition and contradiction; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
well perceiving the policy of Satan, <hi>that great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary of mankinde,</hi> adepting and sitting <hi>this feare of
death</hi> wherein his foot was so aptly and easily taken, and
mounting him upon the wing and pinnacle of popular
observation, and considering also his seeming peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Addresses unto the Parliament, though cloudily,
obstrucely, and very uncertainly fram'd and pen'd, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
(at least unto me) a kinde of a trembling, shaking
and exceeding dissatisfactory frame and temper of
minde, to venture his life upon so bad a cause; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
also <hi>by some of his very neer friends</hi> that were
dayly with him, how uncertain he was in his disposition
to an ingenuous, christian, and plenary acknowledgment
in his Addresses unto the Parliament for mercy, and
that by reason of the various and diverse disposed and
opinionated persons that were his constant Visitors,
some inclining him one way, and some another; some
endevoring (as it seemed to me) to make him a meer
<note n="*" place="margin">Very tampera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for such a purpose, being of a rash, furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, hasty, violent &amp; popular temper &amp; dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Calf, or Heifer, a <hi>Victim</hi> to their cause, though
happily instructing him in that black art of double
dealing, dis-ingenuous distinctions, and reservations to
save his life, together with their cause (could it so be
brought about) some of which friends I fear stuck too
close to him even to his death<note n="a" place="margin">Whose <hi>altum si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentium,</hi> when their dying <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such bitter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives against the present Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, bespeaks either their own minds and judgments in the same; or themselvs very unfit ghostly fathers at such a time.</note>,) Others again advising
him to acknowledg his sin, and to give glory to God; I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65037:4"/>
say, perceiving this poor young man thus harrassed and
hurried in his thoughts and minde; and ready to offer
up his life in this perplexed temper and disposition;
And lastly, calling to minde the most dangerous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
estate and condition of his poor Soul, should he
offer it up unto the service of this lust, not withstanding
his seeming zeal for Gods glory, and the great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hereunto by a mighty concourse of people to see
the manner of his death, and hear his last Scaffold Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
These Considerations wrought upon me, out of
very faithfulness, to write this ensuing Letter, which
take as followeth.</p>

not the world say, 'tis base, 'tis dishonorable? &amp;c. Well Sir, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
God,</hi> and plead not <hi>Conscience</hi> against <hi>Conscience;</hi> it is bad
to <hi>live,</hi> but worse to dye with an <hi>ill Conscience,</hi> especially under the
vizor of a good <hi>Conscience;</hi> an <hi>ill Cause,</hi> yea and an <hi>ill Conscience</hi>
may be slily palliated with many good prayers, Scripture phrases,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65037:5"/>
and a zealous shew of <hi>a very tender Conscience,</hi> and to dye stoutly
in such a Cause, may be reputed <hi>Martyrdom</hi> amongst men, and
<hi>just punishment</hi> with God; it may have <hi>a shew</hi> of pure <hi>Christianism</hi>
with man, but it is pure <hi>Atheism</hi> with God; the more close, secret
and spiritual any sin is, the more dangerous and noxious it is unto
the sinner. Sir, I do not <hi>judg</hi> you, but I <hi>fear</hi> you, I would I had no
cause; if I am mistaken, it is <hi>well,</hi> this can do you no <hi>hurt;</hi> if I am
not mistaken, this may do you <hi>good,</hi> that is my aim, and the desire
of my Soul; for if I know my heart, I could willingly part with
my right hand in <hi>Gods way</hi> for your life, and with my very life <hi>in
that way</hi> for your Soul: That the Lord of Life and Glory would
so communicate himself <hi>yet</hi> unto you before you go hence, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a due sense of the riches and freeness of his grace in our dear
Lord Iesus Christ, and so rest, peace, and fulness of satisfaction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that accompt, and also a due feeling of your own miscarriages in
all your ways, and chiefly of that that hath brought you to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated
end, that you may yield up your life as becomes such a sense,
and that <hi>eternal</hi> life may second your <hi>temporal,</hi> is the hearty pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

past a strict <hi>examen</hi> by a judicious godly man, one of Mr <hi>Loves</hi> very
good friends and acquaintance, and very zealously industrious for his
Pardon, before it was sent unto Mr <hi>Love;</hi> for indeed I feared Mr
<hi>Loves</hi> sinister interpretation and misconstruction of it, who was
very importunate with me to send it unto him: but it is true which
<hi>Solomon</hi> saith, That <hi>a froward heart findeth no good.</hi> All that I
shall say of Mr <hi>Love</hi> is this, His sin, vanity and folly have found him
out, and pursued him to his grave, but I hope shall follow him no
further: As for my self, I cannot with my self better (in wishes of
this nature) then to desire God to g<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
