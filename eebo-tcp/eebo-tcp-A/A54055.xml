            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Some Conſiderations proposed <add>to this distracted nation of England concerning the preſent</add> deſign and work of God therein, upon their ſubmitting whereto doth their Settlement alone depend, and not upon any form of Government, or change of Governors, as that Spirit which ſeeketh their ruin, tempteth them to believe.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THAT God in great mercy, brake the bands of the Romiſh yoak, which lay hard upon the neck of this Nation, and was very weighty upon thoſe conſciences, wherein the true reforming light did ariſe in any meaſure; and who were in any meaſure true to that light, which the Lord cauſed to break in upon them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the reformation out of Popery, was not preſently perfected (nay was never yet perfected) but was very weak and low, many things therein ſavouring very much of Popery, (the Nation being hardly able to bear at that time what was done,) ſo that there were many things, ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing which could not but be burthenſome to the upright-hearted, and to the tender conſciences, as the light which began their reformation, did grow and increaſe in them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Lord God (who in ſuch great mercy had delivered this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the yoak of Popery) could not but expect that the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould grow and increaſe, until it were perfected; even until nothing were left which aroſe from that ſpirit from whence Popery ſprang, and which might (in its proper tendency) be ſerviceable to that ſpirit, but that all his people in this Nation, might have free liberty at leaſt (if not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement) to return to the pure worſhip of him in ſpirit and truth, even as in the dayes of the Apoſtles, before the apoſtacy from the Spirit, and from the truth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the reformation out of Popery, was not purſued as the Lord expected it ſhould, but a dark way of worſhip eſtabliſhed in the land, and a dark Church government (both very like that of <hi>Rome</hi>) whereby thoſe that were truly conſcientious, and in whom the reformed light did further and further ariſe, were reproached, nick-named, hated, perſecuted, &amp;c. inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that there was a bar ſet up againſt the proceeding of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any further, and a formal way of Church-government and worſhip e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, which was pleaſing to the looſe and carnal Spirit, but ſharp, cruel, and burthenſome to the ſtricter ſort, and to ſuch as were tender-hearted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God</p>
            <p n="5">5. That under this Church-government, and way of worſhip, there was a go<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng backwards towards Popery again, inſtead of going further from it. Things grew e<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ery day worſe and worſe, ceremonies dayly abounding, and were more and more ſtrictly injoyned, wearing of Surplices, bowing at the name of Jeſus, railing of the Communion tables, and making ſteps up to it, calling them high Altars, (bowing thrice at their approach to them) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving corporaſſes over the bread, ſaying ſecond ſervice, &amp;c. And the chief end of their viſitations, was to eſtabliſh ſuch things as theſe, and to ſuppreſs Lecturers and conſcientious Preachers (among whom ſome freſh life did ſpring up, for the relief of the needy and deſolate) and to curtal preaching (and praying before and after Sermons) yea and catechiſing too, which by authority was appointed in the place of the after-noon Sermons, when they found it exceed the limits they intended. And this proceeded ſo far, that there was very little difference betwen us and the Papiſts, ſave only the name; the worſhip in both becoming dead, and formal, and pleaſing to the fleſhly part, but empty of that which ſhould feed and refreſh the Spirit. Only the Lord had reſerved to himſelf a remnant, who could not bow to theſe things, but groaned under them, &amp; witneſſed againſt them, mourning bitterly to the Lord under the load and weight of them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That when the wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt this form of Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, &amp; worſhip (as indeed it was high time for the Lord to appear, for the power and life of Religion was even expiring) and he brake down all that ſtood up in the defence of it, and gave much liberty to the oppreſſed ſpirits and conſciences of his people, yet this was not pleaſing to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but fain would they have had either the ſame form up again, or at leaſt ſome other ſuch like in the ſtead of it; whereby the looſe ſpirit of the Nation, might be ſetled in ſome way of formal worſhip, and the growing reforming light ſnibbed in the ſpirits of the tender-hearted towards God.</p>
            <p>Look back with a ſingle and honeſt eye, Hath it not been thus? Hath there not been a ſharp contention, between God and this Nation concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this thing? The Lord hath riſen to remove the yoak from off the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that he might cauſe the Powers of this Nation, to let the oppreſſed conſcience go free, but the Nation would have them bound. It is ſtill crying to the powers and authorities in being, to lay the yoak on again; When one power is broken down (becauſe it is not faithful in the Lords hand, but ſtarts aſide from the Lords work, for which it was choſen, to another of its own chuſing) it ſeeks to have another harder power ſet up, (I mean harder to the tender conſcience) yet God overturns that alſo, and what can ſtand before him, who is riſen to ſhake terribly the earth, and to make the Oakes, and Cedars thereof to fail, totter, and fall? O <hi>England</hi>! Will nothing ſerve thy turn, but the enſlaving of Gods heritage? That tenderneſs of conſcience, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> God hath begotten in his people, is his own, is that which he will inherit. It is that which he brought out of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſs of Popery, and which he is now redeeming, and delivering from the relicks thereof: and if theſe three Nations ſhould for the generality, joyn together as one man, yea, and though other Nations ſhould joyn with them, yet wil they fall ſhort of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wiſdome to prevent the Lord of bringing to paſs his intended work.</p>
            <p>Was it the generality of the Nations God redeemed out of Popery, or was it a poor perſecuted remnant for whoſe ſakes he did it, and whom he chiefly had reſpect unto? And is not the Lord able to carry on this work, further and further? Did he ſuffer them alwaies to be ſtopped in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, and held in bondage by Epiſcopacy? Nay, did he not at length break it down at their cries, and for their ſakes? And do ye think he will now ſuffer the line of <hi>Preſbytery</hi> to be ſtretched over them, to keep them down from riſing up any further in obedience to the pure Law of life in their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits? <hi>O England,</hi> in the zeal of the Lord of Hoſts, I could bid defiance to all thy councils and ſtrength, though I ſhould ſee thee encompaſſe round his poor ſuffering ſeed (who are very weake and fooliſh, as to that kind of ſtrength and wiſedome) becauſe mine eye ſeeth the Almighty one (before whom in thy greateſt ſtrength, and height of confidence, thou art as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) engaged againſt thee: but I rather chuſe to mourn over thee, and to wait for the opening of thine eyes, by the anointing of the true eye-ſalve, which alone can unbewitch the Nations? Yea in bowels of tender love and pity to thee, I do beſeech thee, <hi>O England</hi> conſider thy ſelf, do not undo thy happineſs and proſperity, fight not againſt the holy one, the mighty one of deſpiſed, diſtreſſed <hi>Iſrael:</hi> be not tempted to follow <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the wilderneſs, (where they now are, and whither the hand of the Lord hath led them) to bring them back again into bondage, becauſe thou ſeeſt them entangled in the ſtraits, and nothing appears able to deliver them out of thy hand. Remember what befel <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his hoaſt. This <hi>Iſrael</hi> whom thou hunteſt, is dearer to the Lord then ever that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was: for that was but a ſhadow of the true ſeed, but the true life it ſelf is begotten, and brought forth in many of theſe, and the power, and preſence of the Lord is mightily with them and amongſt them, though thou in the unbeliefe canſt not ſee it. There is now an hour of temptation upon thee, there appears a fair opportunity to thee to be revenged on them, and to bring them under: take heed what thou doſt, leſt he who hath the power over all, bring thee under, and ſet them on top; ſeek righteouſneſs, ſeek the good of all, ſeek true reformation, and the Lord will bleſſe thee; but if thou think to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſetting up of old forms, and waies of worſhip and Government, or any new ones like to the old, under which the righteous cannot but groan (though the wicked, and looſe ſpirit way rejoyce) thou wilt be deceived, and thy miſtake may prove very dangerous and bitter to thee. Our earneſt deſires to the Lord for thee are, that thou maiſt be ſpared as much as is poſſible (and that the ſufferings of Gods People from thee, from the very firſt rent from Popery till this day, may not be laid to thy charge) but ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is ſo twiſted into thy bowels, that without much tearing, which will cauſe great pain to thee, it can hardly be ſeparated from thee. Thou art too wiſe and wilfull, this is the cauſe of thy ſorrow. If thou couldſt fear before the Lord, and patiently wait for the revealing of his will, and of his guiding thee by his wiſdome, and not be ſo enraged againſt inſtruments, but ſee through them to his hand (who hath afflicted thee,) and humble thy ſelf before that, how ſweetly and eaſily might his work go on in thee! But alas, haſt thou not ſet thy ſelf againſt it from the very firſt? And now thou art much pleaſed with a ſeeming probability of turning it backward. Ah poor land, what will this ſtiffe ſpirit, (which hath all along theſe times of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, repined at, and oppoſed the work of the Lord) bring thee to?</p>
            <p>The time of reformation is come, the work of reformation is begun by that power, which is able to carry it on, and that which now ſtandeth in the way thereof, (how high, and mighty ſoever) will be overturned. And although (as to what men have done) the cauſe and work of reformation may juſtly become a reproach, yet the foundation of reformation which God hath laid, is glorious: and in theſe troubleſome times, is he rearing up the building of his new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which when he hath finiſhed and brought forth, will dazle the eyes of the whole Earth. <hi>O England</hi> be not high mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, run not out into parties, and breaches in the heady will, but fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him whoſe power is over thee, (who comprehends all thy councels, ſtrength, deſigns, and hopes, as with a ſpan; and when they are at the height, can moulder them to nothing, with the touch of his finger) for his will muſt ſtand, not thine.</p>
