         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THis Paper was not to come abroad with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Preface, as well as Comment, for Instruction of our young Master, who newly launch'd from the Vniversity (where he has lost a year or two) is not yet Travell'd, or if happily he has made <hi>le petit Tour</hi> (with the formal thing his Governour <note n="*" place="margin">Whom the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>MaÃ®tre des ours,</hi> a Bearward.</note>) having never yet Read <hi>Tully</hi>'s Offices through, since he came from School, sets up for a <hi>Bean,</hi> and Equipp'd for the Town at his Return, comes to seek Adventures in an Ocean full of Rocks, and Shelves, and wants a Skilful Pilot to Steer him, as much as any Vessel that goes to the <hi>Indies</hi>; and oftentimes returns home Leaky, and as poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Freighted, as those who have been near Shipwrack'd, or lost their Voyage.</p>
                  <p>It is for direction of such as are setting out towards this Great and Famous Emporium (whether the design be for Miss or Marriage) what Cargo he must provide; not as Merchants do for <hi>America,</hi> Glass-Beads, and Baubles, in exchange for Gold and Pearl; but Gold and Pearl, and all that's precious, for that which is of less value than Knives and Childrens Rattles.</p>

Memory, simple and plain Men as they were) who Courted and chose their Wives for their Modesty, Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, keeping at Home, Good-Housewifery, and other Oeconomical Virtues then in Reputation: and when the young Damsels were taught all these in the Country, and their Parents Houses, the Portion they brought was more in Virtue than Money, and she was a richer Match than one who could have brought a Million, and nothing else to commend her. The Presents which were made when all was concluded, were a Ring, a Necklace of Pearl, and perhaps another fair Iewel, the <hi>Bona Paraphernalia</hi> of her prudent Mother, whose Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Kirtle, Gown and Petticoat lasted as many Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries as the happy Couple liv'd together, and were at last bequeathed with a Purse of old Gold, Rose-Nobles, Spur-Royals, and Spankers, as an House-Loom to her Grand-Daughter<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

at the Whizze of the Grey-Goose-Feather: 'Twas then Ancient Hospitality was kept up in Town and Country, by which the Tenants were enabled to pay their Landlords at punctual day: the Poor were relieved bountifully, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was as warm as the Kitchin, where the Fire was perpetual.</p>
                  <p>In those happy days, Sure-Foot, the Grave and steady Mare, carried the Good Knight and his Courteous Lady behind him to Church, and to visit the Neighbourhood, without so many Hell-Carts, Ratling Coaches, and a crue of <hi>Damme Lacqueys,</hi> which a Grave Livery Servant or two supply'd, who rid before and made way for his Worship.</p>
                  <p>Things of Vse were Natural, Plain, and Wholesome, nothing was superfluous, nothing necessary wanting; and Men of Estate studied the Publick Good, and gave Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of true Piety, Loyalty, Iustice, Sobriety, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the good Neighbourhood compos'd most differences: Perjury, Suborning Witnesses, Alimony, Avowed Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and Misses (publickly own'd) were Prodigies in those days, and Laws were Reason, not Craft, when Mens Titles were secure, and they served their Generation with Honour; left their Patrimonial Estates improv'd to an Hopeful Heir, who passing from the Free School to the Colledge, and thence to the Inns of Court, acquainting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with a competent Tincture of the Laws of his Country, followed the Example of his worthy Ancestors; and if he Travell'd abroad, it was not to count Steeples, and bring home Feather and Ribbon, and the Sins of other Nations; but to gain such Experience as rendred him useful to his Prince and Country upon occasion, and confirm'd him in the Love of both of 'em above any other.</p>
