            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

C<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. for beginners; I meane Catechismes, to enter them into the knowledge of God: but not any (as yet) haue set too their hands, to enterpret in our Mother tongue (in Alphabet order) the cheefe words of our Science, which being very hard and darkesome, sound in the eares of our weake Schollers, as Latine or Greeke words, as indeede, many of them are deriued from these Languages; and this I haue estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as no smal let to hinder the profiting in knowledge of holy Scriptures amongst the vulgar; because, when in their reading or hearing Scriptures, they meet with such principall words, as carry with them the Marrowe and pith of our holy Religion; they sticke at them, as at an vnknowne language. <hi>Mathias Flaccius Illyricus</hi> (whom I did not looke vpon, nor vppon <hi>Enchiridion Marlorati,</hi> vntill I had well nie done this worke) hath worthily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this in Latine, by whose helpe, it is easie for a Diuine to do some such worke in English: I, the vnmee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test and vnwoorthiest of all my Bretheren, not one of a thousand, but the meanest of ten thousand; haue attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this enterprise, and performed a poore some-thing, sufficient onely, to giue the more learned an occasion to do some more exact thing in this kinde. Therefore, for their better encouragement thus to doo, (besides the breach of the Ice vnto them) I haue breefely set downe before them, the great and manifold profits that would arise out of such a worke, being substantially done. First of all, thy selfe, being a Minister of the word, it wil bring thee this fruite, that thou shalt teach with more facility, hauing readie and at hand, the true and right definition of things. Secondly, the distinguishing of wordes of
<pb facs="tcp:21799:6"/>
diuers acceptions, lying alwayes by thee, will ease thee of some labour in searching, when thou art enforced by occasion of the Text, to enterpret such words. Thirdly, the people committed to thy charge, being by meanes of such a Booke, well acquainted with the cheefe Wordes, which containe any Doctrine, thou shalt not neede in the course of thy teaching, to bee alwayes troubled with the opening of such wordes; but presuming vppon their knowledge, maiest the more insist and dwell in the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and vrging the Doctrine and practise of the thinges so well vnderstood before. Now, as touching the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, their growth and proceeding in Christianitie, will be greater and more speedy, by the help of such a Dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary; which hauing giuen light vnto them, to know the principall wordes of their Art, the matter of Doctrine contained in these words, and raised out of them, wil be sooner perceiued, and take better impression. Againe, the right distinguishing of thinges, the one from the other, when the Nature and due bounds of euery worde is declared, would proue some preseruatiue against er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Heresie, which commonly arise vpon the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of things, while they are shuffled confusedly togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one thing being taken for another; or some thing being taken to bee that, it is not. I could shew this in sundry particulers, one instead of all: <hi>Iustification;</hi> this word, not rightly vnderstood, what errors hath it bred? whilst some take it, to bee the making of our selues iust, infusion of grace in the hearts of the elect. Others, to be nothing else, but a making of our actions to become iust and holy; whereas, it is an absolution of a Sinner from his guiltinesse, and pronouncing him righteous by God, when he beleeues in his sonne Christ Iesus. Lastly, it will prouoke Christians more willingly to reade Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when they haue at hand a Dictionary, to declare and expound such words as they vnderstand not. For, as men aduenture to cracke that Nut, whose Kernell by cracking is to be obtained; so the Christian is much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb facs="tcp:21799:7"/>
to read, when hee hath, as it were, a cracker to get him the Kernell; that is, a Dictionarie to giue him the sence of the words, which he reads. To conclude, it may preuent scruples, which may arise in some Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, through ignorance of words, and their true and fit meanings.</p>
                  <p>Now, a few Aduertisements will be requisite to bee added about this my simple endeuour. First, my care was to put in no words, but such as were material, &amp; of some moment and vse. Secondly, if either I haue left out some materiall wordes, or not giuen all the significations of those whereof I haue made choise, or giuen more then they haue, or not set downe the significations for order, so precisely as would be; let these faults (if any such be) be pardoned by thee, till they be supplied by some more sufficient: for whom (as I haue saide) I doo heerein but breake the Ice. Yet heereof, I woulde haue them take knowledge, that such significations as I giue, I find them in the word: but if any worde haue other, or more, it is more then I finde. Thirdly, I would haue none to think, that my meaning were to giue an exact definition of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thing (let him be thought verie wise and happie, that can do this) but some true and familiar explication or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of words, to make things that be obscure to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come somwhat plainer to the ignorant. Fourthly, these explications which I do giue, may differ in tearmes from such explications, as yee shall finde in other mens Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the same wordes. But I verily trust, that you shall finde for the most part, an agreement in substaunce of truth. Moreouer, in citing Scriptures, I haue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time noted such places, wherein the words which I doo interpret, is onely named; Sometime, the place where the Interpretation is found, with the word; and some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which only haue the Interpretation, &amp; not the word. I cite few places, because the light giuen to a worde in one place, will clear other places where that word is vsed in that same sence, which the aduised Reader shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
<pb facs="tcp:21799:7"/>
by the circumstance of the place. Besides, I haue put some Ecclesiasticall wordes, which be not found in Scripture, in so many Sillables, yet are there for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Sacrament, &amp;c.</hi> Againe, sometime ye shall finde the word, and sometime the thing, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time both opened. Finally, my request is, that no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster do by this Booke hinder his owne searching, it being intended to be a meane rather to whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> his diligence to search more narrowly: nor any hearer vse it to contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but to edification; not for matter of ydle dispute, but for needfull direction. And if I be longer in the explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some words, then the Nature of a Dictionary wil beare, or do open some wordes, which (to some) may seeme needlesse; impute it eyther vnto the waightinesse of the things, which being darke and important, neede opening; or vnto the dulnesse of common Capacities, which see little in diuine matters; or if ye will, to want of dexterity in my selfe, who haue beene but of late ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this Trade. Thus entreating thee (cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader) to haue consideration of my weakenesse, and of the newnesse and strangenesse of the worke, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourably to pardon wants (which in such a forrest of words and things, cannot but be many) I commend thee vnto the mercifull goodnesse and protection of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 The most wordes of Holy Scripture, both maine and meane, both proper and borrowed; are heere plainely, and with few words expounded and opened, to help the Minister to interpret, and the hearers to vnderstand the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The sundry and diuers acceptions and scattered sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of one and the same word, are noted and gathered vnder one view, with fit places of Scripture, agreeing to the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of the sence.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:21799:8"/>
there ye haue the name of that Trope or Figure, set down vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Word, whether it be <hi>Metaphor</hi> or <hi>Metonimie, Irony, Sinecdoche,</hi> or some other; by which meanes, the reason of pulling many words from the Primitiue significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to a secondary, may appeare.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Besides single words, this Booke interpreteth very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny double words, compounded of a Nowne &amp; an Adiectiue, or Epithite. Also sundry Scripture-Phrases be expounded.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 In setting down the meaning of the words, this Dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary doth very often point at some wholesome Doctrine, and sometime expresseth it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 All the wordes of foundation (as I verily trust) which contain the sure grounds of our Faith and Religion, are heere comprehended.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Heere bee giuen the definitions of the Capitall and chiefe matters, with due proofes of Scripture, to confirme euery part of the definition, the better to expresse the nature of things.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 You shall find not a few Theologicall distinctions and diuisions, the better to distinguish one thing from another.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 Not onely wordes, which beare difference betweene Protestants and Papists, are written downe and cleared in this Booke, but also there is a taste giuen, of the oddes and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence it selfe, in most points of Controuersie, between vs and them, for the information of such as haue lesse profited, in discerning the differences.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 There bee two thousand Texts of Scripture (at the least) declared and made plaine, to the vnderstanding of the simplest.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 Vnto such words as be hard or waighty, I haue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times added, for fuller edifycation, short and easie obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vnder this word [<hi>Note</hi>] being set in the Margent.</p>

In this behalfe, how much the Church of God is beholding to that learned iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Writer, M. <hi>Caluin,</hi> all that are learned, do wel know, and willingly confesse: For when hee meetes with a place, wherein he seeth men haue made scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he doth in the end (after some sifting of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) strike the Nayle full on the head, with his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>Census est,</hi> This is the sence or meaning of the place. And surely, we ought thankfully to receiue what heere this Author (though in many other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, and in this also, farre inferiour to <hi>Caluin,</hi> out of whom he will acknowledge to haue suckt his best knowledge) painfully and freely offereth vnto vs, who heerein imitateth M: <hi>Caluin;</hi> For, as the one beates out the meaning of a sentence, so this present Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, labours to presse and draw out the Kernel, which lyes hidde and wrapt in some obscure and doubtfull words. Finally, in humblenesse of heart, apply thy selfe to profit by this &amp; other such profitable Books, as are framed to the edification of the godly Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in their most holy faith. Farewell.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Vrteous Reader, thou art much bound to blesse God, for the great plenty and aboundance of excellent Bookes, which by the handes of his painefull and godly Seruants he hath afforded thee, as helps and furtherances to bring thee to the sound knowledge, and right vnderstanding of his sacred word: But among them all, in my iudgement, there is no one in our Natiue tongue, that dooth more oblige thee to true thankfulnesse, then the Booke thou now beholdest, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the great necessity and manifolde vse of the same; as also the exceeding rich profit and benefite, which (by Gods blessing, if thou make the right vse of it) thou mayst reap thereby. For beside the multiplicity and great variety of wholesome matter, which thou shalt finde scattered through the whole worke, heere thou hast most of the dark words and phrases contained in the Scripture, in Alphabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall order; plainely, breefely, (yet fully) and soundly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded; and in most places, the corrupt glosses of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists vpon them, compendiously discouered and confuted. Heere thou maist at one view, see the diuers acceptations and significations of words, with the figures and Tropes denoted, in which the Scripture vseth them. By this Book, thou shalt be made able to distinguish of words, which in Scripture are ambiguous, to explaine wordes and phrases obscure, and easily to vnderstand such as bee hard and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. By this Booke, if thou be a Minister, thou shalt become <hi>Bonus Textuarius</hi> (for what is that but to bee able to giue the true meaning and gemine sense of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?) and <hi>bonus Textuarius est bonus Theologus.</hi> This Booke will make thee a more profitable teacher; for <hi>qui bene distinguit, bene decet.</hi> By this Booke (whosoeuer thou be) thou shalt be fortified to shield thy selfe (and haply o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers too) from errour, as also to see when others do erre, and to draw them out of errour; for errour springes from ignorance; that is, from misvnderstanding the Scripture.

In a word, by this book in short space, and with no great labour, thou mayst plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully abound in all heauenly wisedome and knowledge. So that, as one saith of <hi>Cicero; Sciat se multum profecisse, cui Cicero vnice placet;</hi> In like manner, it may more truelie be affirmed of this Booke; whosoeuer he bee that deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth much in it, shall thereby gaine infinite benefit. The Authour hath beene pleased to entitle this Booke <hi>A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Dictionary,</hi> and so it is; for it interprets wordes. But it may also be worthily called; <hi>The Key of the Treasures hid in holy Scripture; the enemy of Ignorance; The high and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy path to Knowledge; The Discloser of Gods holy secrets; A light for Ministers, whereat they may borrow light; A Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne for the people, to direct them in the Light:</hi> And to bee short, the way to make all the Lords people to prophesie, as <hi>Moses</hi> wished. Then Gentle Reader, be not without it, let it be continnally by thee, yet buy it not for Nouelty, because it is the first of this kinde that euer saw the light; but for the vnualuable worth of it. <hi>Sit tibi charus, non quia rarus, sed amatus quod amabilis;</hi> 1. <hi>amari dignus.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, in this vast Ocean, and large Forrest of words contained in this Dictiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I doe find that there be three sorts most materiall; where of I desire that thou sholdst take more especiall notice and knowledge, as being of more worth and waight. The first I call an Ecclesiasticall word, which being translated from common vse of speech, is by the Church appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to signifie holy and diuine things. A word of this kind, though it be not in the Scripture for Letter and Sillables: yet is to be found there for matter and substance; as Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, &amp;c. Sacrament, Indifferent, Satisfaction, Merit, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>A word of the second rancke, I doe tearme <hi>Polemicall;</hi> because it pertaines to Controuersie, &amp; hath in it a ground of difference betweene the true Christian, which thinketh, speaketh, and writeth <hi>Orthodoxally,</hi> and soundly; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which loue and embrace errors, in fauour where of they wrest, and peruert the pure wordes of Scripture: as <hi>Iustification, Assurance, of Faith, Hope of Glory, Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scence, Antichrist,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>A word of the third sort, is called <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> of which kind, I doe take such wordes to be, as doe containe in them things, which beeing denyed, Religion it selfe is ouerthrowne; euen as an house is ouer-turned, by taking away the foundation or ground-worke whereuppon it stands; as <hi>Grace, Fayth, God, Christ,</hi> &amp;c. for the descer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of these words from other, I iudge this to be a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary rule.</p>
                  <p>A word, containing in it anything, which being deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">A Rule whereby to iudge a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall word.</note> either God himselfe, any person of the God-head, the decrees of God, his properties, his workes of Creation and prouidence, his word of Law and Gospell: or Christ Iesus the Mediator, his Person, Natures, Offices, benefits,
<pb facs="tcp:21799:15"/>
Church, and people be denied; either directly, or by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and immediate consequence. Any such word is <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> for that must needs be the foundation of an House, which being remooued, the house cannot but fall. Of this Nature be the wordes, vpon deniall whereof, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes the ruine of the whole Fabricke of Religion.</p>
                  <p>Of these three kindes of words, I haue heere drawne a Table after the order of the Alphabet, setting a Starre * before an <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> word, to know it by. I haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed this sillable [<hi>Con</hi>] aboue a Polemical word, and haue placed an [<hi>F</hi>] ouer the head of a fundamentall word: where it happeneth, that any one word is both an <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> &amp; a word of <hi>Controuersie,</hi> I haue written vpon the top of it, both a Star, and this sillable [<hi>Con.</hi>] Also, you shall find this sillable [<hi>Con</hi>] and an [<hi>F</hi>] ouer euery word, which is both <hi>Polemicall,</hi> and a word of <hi>Foundation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreouer, whereas I haue with the explication of words, sometimes ioyned the definition of the thing expressed by such a word, ye shall finde this sillable [<hi>Def.</hi>] put vnder the foote of such a word. And those words in this Table that doe admit distinctions, they are noted out by this sillable [<hi>Dist.</hi>] directly put vnder the word.</p>
                  <p>Finally, if in the draught, either of this Table, or of this whole Dictionary, I haue failed in any thing (as no doubt but I haue, being but a man; and therefore subiect to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, from which no Booke is priuiledged, sauing the book of Bookes,) I do earnestly entreate thee to couer my slips by loue, eyther amending them, or admonishing mee of them: doing vnto me, as in the like case thy selfe wouldest bee done vnto: euer remembring, that it is much easier to dislike, then to doe the like. The former, will cost thee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but the latter (trust me) will cost thee paines, vnto sweate and wearinesse, if thou wilt but endeuour to doe what I haue done before thee.</p>

Also <hi>Galat.</hi> 3, 14. It is called the Promise of the spirit, because the spirit is both the authour and applier of it. More ouer the thinges Promised, come from the spirit. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is also called the worde of faith. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10, 8. Because the worde of this Promise, is made with

condition of faith, which is the only instrument to apprehend and receiue it. Lastly, it is termed the Promise of Christ, because he is the terme and end of it.</p>

Whereas, if we speake exactly, and as the thing is, this renewing of our Nature, is but an effect and fruit of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, which properly is, our incorporation and ingrafting into Christ by Faith, whereby wee haue our spirituall being of Children in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace, as by Carnall generation we haue Naturall being in the Kingdome of this world.

                        <p>Vsury, is any encrease or vantage, for lone of Money, or other things, imposed or layde by the lender vpon the borrower onely, in consideration of the lending. Ezek. 18, 5, 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13, 19, 20. Or more breefely thus: Vsury, is a certaine gaine aboue the principall, exacted vppon Couenant for the vse of money, or other things lent. Exod. 22, 25. <hi>Thou shalt not impose Vsury vpon him.</hi> Thus it is in the Haebrew Text.</p>

                        <p>Vnto Vsurie these fiue things are necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. 1. A principall, as wares, or sum of money. 2. Lending. 3. Gaine. 4. A chiefe purpose by len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to encrease our stocke. 5. a Couenant for that end.</p>
                        <p>As the verie desire and expectation of gaine, for lending onely, is mentall and intentionall Vsurie:<note place="margin">Note.</note> so the imposing, or by Couenant before hand, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing for encrease aboue the principall, is of the Nature of actuall Vsury.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>There are three cases wherein encrease may bee<note place="margin">Note.</note> taken by a lender without danger of Vsury. First, when the borrower hauing by lawfull meanes, made some great gaine by money freely lent, doth

by way of Thankefulnesse, out of the voluntary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his owne heart, returne some-thing aboue the principall vnto the lender, by whose means he had such a blessing.</p>
                        <p>2 When it may be duly and apparantly proued, without pretence and collusion, that the borrower by holding backe the money lent him after the day agreed vpon for paiment, without the leaue of the lender, doth become heereby a direct and effectual cause of hinderance to the Lender, either by da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage arising to him, or by fore-going some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie which he might well haue made with his money, had it come home at the appointed time.</p>
                        <p>3 When the Lender is content to hazard the principall, and to beare part of the losse, if any fal to the borrower, without his owne default. Heere he lawfully may take part of the gain which commeth by good meanes.</p>
