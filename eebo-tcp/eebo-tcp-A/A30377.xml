            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

LETTER
TO
Mr. THEVENOT,
Containing a Censure of Mr. Le Grand's
History of K. Henry the Eighth's Divorce.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>INstead of offering you all those expressions of
Respect, which on many accounts are so
justly due to you, I shall satisfy my self at
present, with this one, which is, That I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
you as a Person of so much Probity and
Sincerity, that notwithstanding all the difference of
Perswasion that is between you and me, yet I can
make an Appeal to you, and refer my self to your
Decision, in the Contests that are like to be between
Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> and me, in a Subject that has a great
Relation to Matters of Religion. Matters of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and the Inferences and Speculations that arise
out of Matters of Fact, appear indeed differently to
Men, according to their various apprehensions of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59665:4"/>
things: While Matters of Fact have but one face,
and appear the same to all who desire to find out
Truth: And therefore, since our Dispute is like to
run wholly on Matters of Fact, I know I run no
hazard when I apply my self to you as an Arbiter.
While I was last at <hi>Paris,</hi> I was so happy as to
have the Honour of waiting sometimes on you, and
saw how just a Title you had to the Esteem and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
which is so universally paid you. I had,
in my own particular, all possible Reason to
acknowledge the high Civilities that you put on me,
and among others, the trouble that you put your
self to, in bringing Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> and me to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
before your self and Mr. <hi>Auzout.</hi> I confess
I apprehended, that I had a man to deal with,
from whom nothing was to be expected but fair
dealing: A Man, that lived in the House of one,
that was no less Eminent for his Sublime Vertue,
than for those high Employments thro' which he
has gone; one that was much with that Learned
and Worthy Gentleman Mr. <hi>Bulteau,</hi> and that saw
often the Famous Mr. <hi>Baluze,</hi> whose Sincerity is
equal to his Learning, which is one of the greatest
things of the Age, and that valued himself on
Mr. <hi>Thevenot</hi>'s Friendship, seemed to be such an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist,
as one would have wisht for. I will not
put you on so uneasy a thing, as the remembring
the poor and inconsiderable things that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in your hearing, of which you were <hi>both</hi> so
weary, and for which you owned your selves so much
<hi>ashamed,</hi> not only to me when Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> was
gone, but to a great many others. You seemed fully
fatisfied, that all he proposed deserved not to be
mentioned, and that such as it was, it was fully
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59665:4"/>
answer'd by me: Mr. <hi>Auzout</hi> indeed desired me not
to boast much of what had past; with which it
was very easy for me to comply: for to tell you
freely, I did not find that my Antagonist was such
a Person, that a Victory over him afforded matter
for a <hi>Triumph,</hi> and in the account that I found it
convenient to give of a part of our Conversation, in
my Remarks on Mr. <hi>Varillas,</hi> I managed Mr. <hi>le
Grand</hi> with all the Respect that he could have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from me, but if hereafter I touch him a
little more sensibly, he has none to blame for it
but himself. I can very easily bear all his Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on me,<note place="margin">p. 30.</note> for my <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>want of Capacity,</hi>
and in particular for my Ignorance of the History
and Laws of <hi>England.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 2, and 3.</note> This comes soon after a
very high and undeserved Commendation that he
had given of me; and it seems he himself thought I
did not deserve it, since he changed his Stile so
soon: It is too common Artifice to pass upon me,
to give a Man a good Title to reproach another, by
introducing those Injuries with high Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But I must be contented with my <hi>small measure
of Knowledge,</hi> and the <hi>low degree of Capacity,</hi> that
belongs to me; and I have the more Reason to bear
with my own defects at present, since I have to do
with one of so moderate a Talent, as Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi>
shews himself to be.</p>
            <p>I wish only that those who desire to be rightly
informed of the famous Transaction now in Dispute,
will be at the pains to read <hi>Sander</hi>'s History and
<hi>mine,</hi> and next to examine Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi>'s <hi>History,</hi>
and then I am confident that they will conclude,
that there must be some Errour in the Printing of
the Title Page, in which there is mention made of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59665:5"/>
a <hi>Defence of</hi> Sander's, and a <hi>Refutation of my History:</hi>
for the bulk of his work, does so agree with mine,
except in some places, where he uses an <hi>Art</hi> for
which I do not envy him, that I am tempted
to think, that in Writing it he intended to make
good his offer made in your hearing, that he
would furnish me with a vast number of Papers,
for the Confirmation of my Work. I have yet only
seen his <hi>first part,</hi> so I cannot imagine how he can
justify <hi>Sanders,</hi> having given him quite up in the
whole thread of his History. The whole Story of <hi>Anne
Bullen,</hi> and all the Branches of it are abandoned,
which yet was the chief thing aimed at by <hi>Sanders;</hi>
as being a nullity in <hi>Q. Elizabeth's Title,</hi> and by
consequence an encouragement to Rebellion. The
Decretal Bull is confessed; the Behaviour of Sir
<hi>Thomas More</hi> is not insisted on by our Author: In
short, if one will examine about eighty Errours,
for which I have charged <hi>Sander</hi>'s History in my
Appendix, he will find above seventy of my contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
of <hi>Sanders,</hi> confirmed by Mr. <hi>le Grand,</hi>
which will be easily made appear, if this Work of
his is judged of that importance, as to deserve a
more particular censure.</p>
            <p>I say nothing of his manner of Writing, for that
will offer it self to every Reader, who must needs
find in him more of the Stile of one that pleads a
Cause, than of one that undertakes to relate Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
An earnestness in proving, and an injurious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Stile, are indecencies that are scarce to be
forgiven to one that pretends to be an Historian:
And there is somewhat that is Sacred even in the
Ashes of Crowned Heads, that claims a Modesty
of Stile: So that even when they are censured,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59665:5"/>
softer words than <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Impostures</hi> ought to be
sought for. And the chief point in this whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
being, whether the King's Cause ought not to
have been judged rather in <hi>England,</hi> and by his
own Clergy, than at <hi>Rome:</hi> The supporting the
Pope's pretensions in opposition to this, as it agrees
very ill with the Principles of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, so
it seems a little strange at this time, in which the
Thunders of the <hi>Vatican</hi> are so little regarded at
<hi>Versailles:</hi> And when an Appeal from a Pope to
a General Council, is, after so long an intermission,
again made use of in so critical a time: It might have
been expected, that this Matter should have been
handled with a little more decency, at least, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
this is one of the Artifices of a sort of Men,
whom Mr. <hi>Talon</hi> has mentioned more freely than I
will do, who perhaps intend to blast what <hi>Lewis
the Great</hi> is doing, by representing <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi>
in ill Colours. But perhaps our Author is not a
Man of so much Intriegue, as to have such remote
Speculations; and this being his first Essay, it is
possible he thought that less application was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
since he reckoned that he had to do with a Man
of so <hi>small a Capacity</hi> as mine is. I will at present
only single out six of the Errours that he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
which are a very small proportion as to
their number, since you will find a much longer
List, if I enter upon a more Crititical Enquiry into
this History; but as these are all of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
so I have limited my self to this number,
that I may not inlarge at present beyond those
narrow bounds, to which I restrain my self in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of this Nature.</p>
            <p>1. He questions much the Contents of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretal
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59665:6"/>
Bull,<note place="margin">Pag. 89. 10 92.</note> that Cardinal <hi>Campegio</hi> brought over, and
thinks, that since it was only shewn to the King and
Cardinal <hi>Wolsey,</hi> no body can affirm what it was;
and if it was a Bull that determined the whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
he does not see how there could be any more oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
for the Legats; and he fancies that upon a
Bull, the King would have proceeded to a second
Marriage, without giving himself any further trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>12th</hi> had done.</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> had given himself the trouble to
have Read the Decretal Bull which I have Published,<note place="margin">Collect. 2. lib. Num. 10.</note>
he would have seen that all this Discourse was to no
purpose. The Bull was drawn in <hi>England,</hi> and sent
to <hi>Rome,</hi> and tho' some few Clauses were altered,
yet by all the Letters that passed between <hi>Rome</hi> and
<hi>England,</hi> it appears, that it was upon the Matter the
same Bull that was sent over by <hi>Campegio.</hi> Now the
Bull declared indeed the justice of the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions;
and empowered the Cardinal Legates to
examine the Truth of these Pretensions; and upon
the Proofs of that, it Authorized them to Judge the
Cause: so that tho' the Pope did by this Decretal give
a definitive Sentence, in case the Pretensions were
found to be true, yet here was still matter left for the
Legates to proceed upon: To wit, whether the King
had himself desired the Marriage? whether there was
any danger of War at that time between <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Spain?</hi> whether the Dispensation was not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled,
by the Protestation the King had made,
when he came of age, against the Marriage? and
whether those Princes, or any of them, upon
whose account the Dispensation was granted, dyed
before the Marriage took effect? And till all these
things were found true, the Bull dissolving the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59665:6"/>
that was granted upon that supposition, could
have no effect: So that all his Reasoning upon this
matter is in the Air.<note place="margin">P. 85.</note> But since I have named Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Campegio,</hi> I acknowledge that Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> seems
to be in the right as to his <hi>Son,</hi> whom I had called a
<hi>Bastard,</hi> but he proves him <hi>Legitimate</hi> from <hi>Sigonius</hi>'s
Life of <hi>Campegio,</hi> which I confess I never saw, and
<hi>Sigonius</hi> is so good an Author, that I acquiesce in his
Authority. But Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> ought to have taken
notice, that I cite an Author for what I say of that
Bastard. <hi>Pelerin Iuglese,</hi> which was a Discourse
writ by Sir <hi>William Thomas,</hi> a Clerk of the Council
at that time, and it seems he took Cardinal <hi>Campe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio</hi>'s
Son for his <hi>Bastard.</hi> So if Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to have looked to the English Edition, he might
have rectified this Errour with less acrimony of Stile,
since it is no forgery of mine; and indeed this is the
only omission that seems to be well grounded, of all
those for which he accuses me.</p>
            <p>2. Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> makes much ado to shake the
credit of the Decision made by the <hi>Sorbon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 179. to 184.</note> in Favours
of King <hi>Henry;</hi> tho' after all, the Printing the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
it self the next year, and its passing for genuine,
no Man having in that Age pretended that it was a
Forgery, is so concluding a Proof for it, that no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuation
to the contrary can be received. Neither
Cardinal <hi>Pool</hi> who was at <hi>Paris</hi> when it past, nor
any other Writer of the Roman Communion, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the King of an Imposture in this Matter. And
as the Bishop of <hi>Tarbe</hi>'s continuing to advance the
King's Interests in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> when he was
promoted to be a Cardinal, and his not disowning
the share that King <hi>Henry</hi> laid on him in publick
before the Legates, of his Scruples concerning his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59665:7"/>
Marriage, is an evident confirmation of it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all our Author's suggestions to the contrary:
So the <hi>Sorbonnes</hi> never disavowing this matter,<note place="margin">p. 135.</note> is an
evident proof that the Judgment was truely given
by them, and all the presumptions that our Author
offers to the contrary, amount to no more but that
great opposition was made; and that <hi>Beda</hi> behaved
himself very factiously in it: It is also to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that as the whole <hi>Gallican</hi> Church was highly
dissatisfied with <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>1st,</hi> for his having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
their Liberties by the <hi>Concordat,</hi> so the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of <hi>Paris</hi> was too much concerned in that
matter, which stuck still deep with them, not to be
full of Malecontents: and perhaps this might have
contributed to make the opposition the greater, since
the King supported King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Concerns with
much Zeal; yet after all, our Author owns, that in
the Scrutiny there were fifty three for the Divorce,
and only forty two against it, and five were
for the referring it to the Pope: so here was enough
for justifying the Judgment, as it is Printed, which
bears only, that the <hi>greater number gave it for the
Divorce, and against the lawfulness of the Marriage:</hi>
And this justifies likewise those words of the first Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident's
Letter, that it would rather prejudice than
advance the King's Affair, since the whole Bodies
in other Universities had judged for the King,
whereas it was carried only by a plurality of Voices
in the <hi>Sorbonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> pretends to give an Abstract of
the Reasons that were brought against the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of King <hi>Henry,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 189. to p. 2<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> and yet he does not mention
that which was the strength of the Cause, which
was that according to the main hinge upon which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59665:7"/>
all the Decisions in the Roman Church turn, <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
expounded by Tradition, is that by which all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
ought to be decided:</hi> So here they brought a
Series of Councils, Provincial and General, of many
Popes, of all the chief Fathers both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi>
particularly of the four great <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Latine</hi>
Church; whereas on the other side, there was not one
Father nor Doctor alledged: And tho' Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi>
pretends only that the Canons of some Provincial
Councils against Incontinence, and some passages out
of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> S. <hi>Basil,</hi> and S. <hi>Ierome</hi> upon Virginity,
and against second Marriages were alledged. Here I
am sure the Reader will censure him, for the want
of somewhat that is more important to an Honest
Man, than <hi>great Capacity:</hi> For the Canons of those
Councils, and Passages of those Fathers, speak ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
of the degrees of Marriage forbid in the Book
of <hi>Leviticus:</hi> And tho' he names only three Popes
whose Letters were cited to the same purpose, he
passes over the chief of them with Relation to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Gregory the Great,</hi> in whose time the <hi>Saxons</hi>
were Converted to the Christian Faith, who gave
an express Instruction to <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk, to annul
all Marriages with a Brother's Wife: And this being
a Rule setled in <hi>England,</hi> when the Christian Religion
was received in it, it was consider'd as one of the
chief supports of the King's Cause, and therefore if
Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> had desired to have the Reputation of a
sincere Writer, he ought not to have passed it over,
nor ought he to have passed over all that was said
against the Pope's Dispensing even with the Laws of
the Church, and much less with the Laws of God:
Nor that other Branch of the King's Plea, that the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59665:8"/>
Church of <hi>England,</hi> according to the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi>
ought to judge this Matter, and that it did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Pope. If Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> is a true Son of
the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, he cannot disown those Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and at least, if he would be esteemed a sincere
Historian, he ought not to have passed them in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
But if he was defective in his account of the
King's Plea, he adds as much of his own to the
Queens: For he has pickt up a great many instances
in History, that were never mentioned in the Books to
of that time; and yet they all amount to no more, but
shew that these Rules of the degrees of Marriage, were
not at all times observed with the same exactness.
But the Church is Govern'd by <hi>Rules,</hi> and not by <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples:</hi>
And all that he saies of the Law in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi>
appointing the Brother to Marry his Sister-in-Law,
when his Brother dyed without Children, had been
ever looked on in the Christian Church, as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
from the general Law, that belonged only
to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, with relation to their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession;
which being taken away under the Christian
Religion, the Laws in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> which have been
ever considered in the Church as Moral Laws, must
now take place Universally. In short, if any man
will be at the pains to compare the Books that were
Written upon this matter, and the Accounts that are
given of them, by Mr. <hi>le Grand,</hi> and by my self, he
will soon see which of us have Writ with the
<hi>greatest sincerity,</hi> and I will not envy Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi>'s
Opinion of his own Capacity, so long as an unbiassed
sincerity is acknowledged to belong to me.</p>
            <p>4.<note place="margin">p. 222.</note> Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> tells us that the Parliament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished
the Oath which the Bishops were bound to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59665:8"/>
sware to the Pope, at their Consecration, and drew
a new one, which they should make to the King.
Here he gives me just Reason, to say severer things
than he may be willing to hear: for in the Parliament,
the two Oaths that the Bishops swore, both to the
Pope and to the King, were Read; and it appearing
that they contradicted one another, they being both
of the nature of an Oath of Homage, which can only
be made to one Superiour, all that the Parliament did,
was to Repeal the Oath to the Pope, and to let the
other to the King remain in its full force. I have
given an undeniable Instance, that the Oath to the
King was in all former times made by the Bishops,
in a Record which I put at the head of my Collection
of Instruments, and which Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> may have
seen, for tho' these Instruments have not yet appeared
in the <hi>French</hi> Translation, yet Mr. <hi>Bulteau</hi> has my
Work in <hi>English,</hi> where all these Records are. In that
Cardinal <hi>Adrian</hi> not only renounces all Clauses in
his Bull, that were contrary to the King's Prerogative,
or to the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> but swears fidelity to the
King in the same terms, in which our Kings have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ever since to have Homage Sworn to them,
by their Bishops. And the Oath to the Pope, as it
was a Novelty not known before the twelfth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
so it contains in it so many wide and indefinite
Clauses, that it seems very hard to reconcile the
taking of it, either with the Doctrines of the <hi>Gallican</hi>
Churches, or with that Subjection which all Bishops
owe their Lawful Prince, since it is plain that is an
Oath of Homage to the Pope.</p>
            <p>5. Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> sets himself with no small force,<note place="margin">p. 244. to 257.</note>
tho' not with equal success, to give <hi>Cranmer</hi> the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59665:9"/>
worst Character that he could make for him: He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses
me for endeavouring to make him pass for a
<hi>Gentleman,</hi> but tho' I knew he was one, yet I said not
a word of it, for I thought that was too inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a thing to have a place among the Honours that
belong to the Memory of that <hi>Great Man.</hi> 
               <q>He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
believe that he was in <hi>Germany,</hi> when by
<hi>Warham</hi>'s Death he was named to the Arch-Bishoprick
of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> And thinks that he could
not have stayed seven weeks there, after he had
the News of his intended Promotion; since he was
present at the King's Marriage with <hi>A. Bolen.</hi> Nor
can he allow my saying, that the thing was slowly
set forward, since there passed but three Months
between <hi>September</hi> and <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in which he was
preconised at <hi>Rome:</hi> Nor can he believe the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Synod of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> judged the matter of the
King's Marriage. Here are Errours enough for Mr.
<hi>Varillas</hi> himself.</q> In <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Printed Tryal he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
to his Judges, who were all Witnesses of that
Matter, that he had unwillingly accepted of that
See; and that he had delayed his return out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
after he had the News of the King's Intentions,
for seven Weeks; and this was passed over by the
Bishops that judged him, without any answer, which
was a plain acknowledgment of the Truth of it.
2. There were twelve Weeks between <hi>Warham</hi>'s
Death, that fell out the 23 of <hi>August,</hi> and the King's
Marriage on the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>November:</hi> So allowing two
weeks for the Currier to go to him, ther is room
enough for his seven weeks delay. But our Author to
turn five Months into three, shuts out both <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
and <hi>Ianuary</hi> out of the account, tho' both ought
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59665:9"/>
to be included. And the Sentence of Divorce bears ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
that both the Provincial Synods of <hi>England,</hi>
had judged the King's Matter: but after all, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
cannot enough aggravate <hi>Crammer</hi>'s taking the
Oath of Obedience to the Pope, at his Consecration,
with the Protestation that limited it, with several re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions:
Which he also reports upon the credit
of some spiteful Authors, quite contrary to what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
upon Record. For he made the Protestation to
be twice Read at the Altar, when he was Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
So it is plain he had no mind to equivocate;
for he owned publickly all that he did. And Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
renouncing all Clauses that were in Bulls, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the King's Prerogative, having been ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
made by Bishops, it seems the Canonists who
were accustomed to double dealing, prevailed so far
on <hi>Cranmer,</hi> as to make him take the method of
Swearing the Oath, and then limiting it by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation
made at the same time: In which it is plain,
that if he committed an Errour, it was rather a
mistake in his Judgment, than a want of Sincerity.</p>
            <p>6. Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> saies that the King pardoned <hi>More</hi>
and <hi>Fisher</hi> the business of the <hi>Maid of</hi> Kent,<note place="margin">p. 280. to 282.</note> and tho'
he owns that <hi>More</hi> calls her in a Letter <hi>the silly Nun,</hi>
yet he takes no notice of that long Letter of <hi>Mores</hi>
which I published among the Instruments of my second
Volume, in which he treats that matter <hi>as one of the
horridest Impostures that ever was,</hi> and for which <hi>Fisher,</hi>
tho' our Author denies it, was Condemn'd for concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Treason: To this he adds, <hi>that the Chancellor having
asked</hi> Fisher <hi>and</hi> More, <hi>what they thought of the Acts of the
last Parliament, they answered nothing, but said, that being
cut off from all Civil Society, they thought of nothing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59665:10"/>
but our Saviour's Passion, and this cost them their
life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is such a corrupting of History, that I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to give it its true name: And indeed a preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication
in this matter is the less excusable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our Author might have found advantage
enough, by representing the matter truly as I had
done, from the Records. They were Condemn'd
first in a Premunire, that imports loss of Estate
and perpetual Imprisonment, for refusing to swear
the Oath for the Succession by the King's Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
Enacted by Parliament: And after that, they
were prosecuted for having spoken against the
<hi>King's Supremacy;</hi> and there is one Incident in <hi>More</hi>'s
Process, which perhaps would be thought enough at
present, for Condemning a Man as Guilty of <hi>High
Treason;</hi> for he said, that as <hi>the Parliament could
make a King, so it could likewise Depose him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I limited my self to six Heads, and I will
not go beyond them. The abundance of Matter
that is before me, makes it uneasie for me to pass
over many important things, which our Author has
left out of his History, tho' they are in that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of Letters published by <hi>Camusat,</hi> and which I
never saw, till he himself not only shewed it me,
but did me the Honour to present it to me: He
does not tell us that the Pope promised to Cardinal
<hi>de Tournon,<note place="margin">Melanges Hist. 1532. folio 8. <hi>M.</hi>
                  </note> that he would do all that was in his Power
for the King of</hi> England, <hi>and that the thing should be
done, tho' he must take such a Method in the point of
Form, as not to seem too partial to him:</hi> And that the
Cardinal thought he was sure of the Pope in that
Matter. The same Cardinal writes the 17 of <hi>Aug. 1533.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59665:10"/>
that tho' the Cardinals of the Imperial Faction forced the
Pope to what he had done,<note place="margin">fol. 9. <hi>N.</hi>
                  </note> yet if the King of</hi> England
<hi>would save his Honour, he would with all his Heart
do what he desired, and did not doubt but he should
propose Expedients for this, at the Interview that was
to be at</hi> Marseilles.<note place="margin">fol. 19. <hi>O.</hi>
               </note> By another Letter it appears,
that <hi>Francis</hi> the First owned to the <hi>English</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours,
that the Pope had said to himself, <hi>that he
knew the King's Cause was just,</hi> and he only stood
upon a Procuration: For the King being cited to appear
at <hi>Rome</hi> in Person, or by Proxy, the King would take no
notice of this:<note place="margin">fol. 177.</note> and so <hi>Karne</hi> was sent over <hi>Excusator,</hi>
to excuse the King's Appearance: But it appears by
that Collection, that he was sent over in the Name
of the Nation, and not in the King's Name: So the
King's refusing to appear, being thought a great
Contempt, the Pope promised to grant the Divorce,
if the King would so far acknowledge his Authority
as to appear at <hi>Rome</hi> by a Proxy upon his Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons:
And in this <hi>Francis</hi> the First thought the King
was in the right; and he approved of his Marriage so far,
that he ordered his Ambassadour to Christen the Child
in his Name,<note place="margin">fol. 140. <hi>P, Q, R.</hi> fol. 174, 175, 176,
177.</note> if it proved a Son. The <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour
at <hi>Rome,</hi> did also in many Letters to the
Court of <hi>France,</hi> write that the Pope <hi>would do all
that was desired for the King of</hi> England, <hi>and much
more if he durst: but he was so hard pressed by the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialists,
that against God and Reason, and even against
the Opinion of many of the Imperialists themselves, he
was forced to do whatsoever the Cardinal</hi> Dosme <hi>asked
of him: And that they wanted much the Cardinal</hi> Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont
<hi>who was Bishop of</hi> Tarbes, <hi>for no man durst speak
Truth to the Pope.</hi> It is true, the Ambassadour who
was then the Bishop of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> says that he expected
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59665:11"/>
               <hi>no good of the Pope, and that all was but dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
Yet to shew that crafty Ambassadours change
their Stile, so that it is hard to know how much one
ought to trust to their Letters, the same day, in
which he had writ the former Letter to the <hi>Legate</hi>
that was in <hi>France,</hi> he wrote another to the <hi>Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
in which he tells him, <hi>that the Pope had said, that
the King of</hi> England<hi>'s Matter had been now four years in
his hands, and was not yet touched by him; and that
if he could do as he would, it should be as they
all would.</hi> And he writes <hi>that he spoke this in
such a manner to him, that he believes he said
what he thought.</hi>
               <note place="margin">fol. 177. <hi>S.</hi>
               </note> These Letters bear all Date the
<hi>7th</hi> of <hi>February 1532.</hi> But the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Iuly</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
he writes, that the Pope said to him, <hi>that he
resolved to put off the Business to a good time,</hi> and
he saw clearly what he meant by a <hi>good time:</hi>
and adds, <hi>that if the thing had been then judged,
the Old and Learned Cardinals would have been for
the King of</hi> England, <hi>but the Imperialists were so
much the stronger Party, that it would have been
carried clear against them:</hi> And tho' Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi>
speaks doubtfully of that Critical Matter, that a
Currier came from <hi>England,</hi> within a day or two
after the Sentence was given, and passes over
the haste in which it was given, as a thing of
which he knew nothing; yet in that Collection,
there is a Letter writ from <hi>Lyons</hi> by <hi>Pompone
Trivulce,</hi>
               <note place="margin">fol. 177. <hi>T.</hi>
               </note> Cardinal <hi>Trivulce</hi>'s Brother, Dated the
<hi>16th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> in which he gives an account
of the Bishop of <hi>Paris</hi>'s passing thro' that Town,
who told him <hi>how precipitated the Sentence was;
that the Pope was indeed for a delay, and if that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59665:11"/>
had been granted only for six days, the King
would have submitted, but the Imperialists would hear
of none: tho' when the Courier came a day after,
they were sorry for the hast they had made.</hi> By all
these Indications it appeared plainly, that the
Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was governed in this matter, only
by Political Motives and Maxims: and therefore
according to the Maxims of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church,
set forth lately with so much Zeal by Mr. <hi>Talon,</hi> in a
matter of much less moment, the King of <hi>England</hi>
had no Reason to have any great Regard to the
Judgments or Thunders of that Court.</p>
            <p>But as I hold my self infinitely obliged to Mr. <hi>le
Grand,</hi> for the Present he made me of so valuable
a Book, which affords me so many Confirmations
of the most important parts of my History, so I am
extream sorry that he has been so far wanting to
himself, as to suppress them: and that he has
put me on so uneasie a thing, as to make use
of a Present that he made me, so much to his
disadvantage. But in this case I must say, <hi>magis
amica veritas.</hi> And tho' he thinks me to be
<hi>extreamly jealous of the Honour of my Writings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 2.</note> yet
if the Concerns of Religion did not enter in this
case, I could more easily abandon my own: But
I will not pursue this Censure further at present:
nor am I yet sure whether I will write more
upon this Subject or not, for till I see his other
three parts, and till I know what effects this
has, I can form no Resolution as to that matter.
In the mean while I beg your Pardon, both for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59665:12"/>
giving you so great a trouble, and for addressing
it to you in so Publick a manner. For since I

OF THE
Variations of the Protestant Churches: Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with some further Reflections on
Mr. Le Grand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU ask my Opinion of Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s
long expected Work: And I will give
it freely. It seems he intends to let
the World see, that he can set forth
the <hi>Reformation,</hi> with as much Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
as he had formerly shewed in setting forth his
own Doctrine; and that he can shew as much Art
in making the one appear <hi>Black,</hi> as he had done
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59665:13"/>
to make the other appear <hi>Fair.</hi> Some of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen
have of late exposed him in so severe a
manner, that his Credit in <hi>England</hi> was so much sunk
before this new attempt that he has made upon
it, that there was no need of this Work to destroy
it quite. The truth is, great Respect is due to his
Age, and Character: But if he will lay himself too
open, and take so much pains to make himself
be known, he will compass it at last. A Man of his
Wit and Softness of Expression, should have held
himself to general Speculations, in which a lively
Fancy and a good Stile, might have helped him out
even when Truth failed him. But of all the Men
I know, he should have avoided the most to meddle
with Matters of Fact. For the gentlest Censure
that can be past on his Performances, that way, is,
that some others furnish him with Extracts, which
he manages to the best advantage, but without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
them. Yet when Mr. <hi>Larogue</hi> had shewed
him, or at least had shewed it to all the World,
if he would not see it, that there was not one
single Passage, of all those which he had, with so
much Pomp, produced for justifying the taking away
the Chalice, that was either sincerely or pertinently
made use of by him; and it seems Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi>
himself was convinced of it, since I have not heard
that he has yet said one word to justify himself.
He should not have ventured again, tho' he has
returned with a particular degree of assurance, to say
in this Work, that in the Primitive Church, Men
received the Sacrament, either in the one or the
other Species. He may now perhaps say, that he
never Read <hi>Larague</hi>'s Book, with the same Truth,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59665:13"/>
that he writ to <hi>England</hi> that he had never seen <hi>F.
Crasset</hi>'s. The Truth is, Reason is a tame thing,
which bends easily to a Man of Wit and Fancy:
But Facts are sullen things, they are what they are:
Wit has no place there, but Boldness and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
can supply all defects. Yet since Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi>
found that his under-work-men had dealt so ill with
him, he should have been more cautious in trusting
them for the future: And since even his most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Protestations have been laid open to the <hi>English</hi>
Nation, as having more of an Air of assurance, than
of a scrupulous Regard to Truth in them, he ought
to have taken a little more care of himself, and of
his Friends in <hi>England,</hi> who have ill Success enough
already in what they themselves have writ, and in some
small aid which he has sent them, and therefore it
is too cruel in him, to give new occasions to those
who will be sure to make the best of all that is
given them, for shewing the weakness of a Cause,
which how prosperous soever it may be in the hands
of <hi>Dragoons,</hi> yet has never had worse success than
of late in <hi>England.</hi> The Calumnies of <hi>Cochlee, Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
de Raimond,</hi> and other Writers of the last Age,
were already revived and put in more Modern
<hi>French</hi> by <hi>Maimbourg</hi> and <hi>Varillas,</hi> who have not
failed to tell the Tale over again in the best Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and with the best Grace they could; so that it
was a little below Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Greatness to
come after them, in a design which has succeeded
so ill with them. It is true, he has much more Wit, and
gives a better Air to the Malice that he bears the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches, who have done nothing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
him, if it was not that they chuse rather to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59665:14"/>
take that to be Doctrine of his Church, which they
found both in the Decrees of their Councils, the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Offices, and the Chief Writers of Controversy,
that have explained those Matters, ever since the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
was first set on foot, than the new <hi>Tour</hi> that he
has thought fit to give it. In short, he is in ill Humour,
because his Exposition was not successful enough to
save his Church the Infamy of the Dragoons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Hinc illae
lachrimae,</hi> and therefore he has now gathered together
all that the Writers of the last Age had set forth, and
added to that all the Extracts that his tools could
furnish him with, that so he might Triumph over
us with as much Scorn as Malice. He mixes all
along with it the Flowers of a melting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
Eloquence; but tho' these figures pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with a soft Voice, and in a languishing Air,
may have perhaps wrought on some who slave
come to him with a Design to be deluded by him;
yet when they are on Paper, they are but bleak
and feeble strains: And the affectation that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in them, is too gross to pass even on Men
that are already Partial in his Favours. Indeed they
ought rather to Biass a Man the other way. He
has called it the History of our Variations, but the
truer Title had been the History of the Progress
of the Reformation. If all that he has said were
true, it will amount to no more than this, which
we grant, without his being at so much pains to
prove it, which is, that neither were our Reformers
<hi>Inspired,</hi> nor our Sinods <hi>Infallible.</hi> But after all, it
gives no small Provocation to Humane Nature, to
see a Man that is of a Church, whose History is
one continued Thread of Variations, and that in so
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59665:14"/>
many Essential points, from what it self was in the
Primitive time, keep such a stir with a few incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Changes, that have been made among
the Reformed. If all was not at first discovered, the
Changes that the Reformers made, was a Progress
and not a Variation; but after that their Confessions,
were once formed, we all know that they have
stuck to them perhaps with too much stiffness; so
that it were a much easier thing, to shew that they
ought to have varied, than to prove that they
have done it. In short, we are but Men, and ought
not to be ashamed to own that we grow in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and that we no sooner discover Errours than
we forsake them. Here is then a great Book writ
to as little purpose as can be, since it concludes only
that we are neither Inspired nor Infallible, to which
we never pretended. If a Man of Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s
Wit, would at his rate of Writing, pretend to give
the History of the first Variations of the Christians,
and would begin with the Sect of the <hi>Iudaisers,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that tell us of all the Schisms at <hi>Corinth,</hi> of the
Scandals of their Lives, and the enormous disorders
in their Worship; some Feasting in their Churches
till they were Drunk, before they went to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;
others, that had even the extraordinary
gift of Tongues, affecting to gratifie their Vanity
by shewing it in their Publick Assemblies, while
false Apostles studied to supplant the Respect that was
due to the true Apostles, and some false Teachers
denied the Resurrection: If one will go thro' the
Epistles writ to the other Churches, and bring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
all the disorders that he finds among them,
if to these he will join the Epistles in the second
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59665:15"/>
and third Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and from
these pretend to give us the Character of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
of the first Age; and if from that he should go
to bring into the Picture all the Abominations of
the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> all the Follies of the <hi>Valentinians,</hi>
and all the Extravagancies of the other Heresies. If,
I say, a Heathen that had as much Wit, and as much
spite as Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> has shewed in this Work,
would undertake this, he might write Historical
Essaies, that would be as little to the Honour of
the Christian Religion, as Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Work is to
the Honour of the Reformation. And if a Man will
examine either S. <hi>Athanase</hi>'s Life, <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria's,
Liberius</hi>'s, <hi>Osius</hi>'s or <hi>Damasus,</hi> with as much
diligence as Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> had shewed, in bringing
together all the weaknesses of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> (whether
real or pretended) and would carry down such a
Critique on all the other Saints, the Kalender would be
cleared of a great many Rubricks. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great's
Infamous Courting both of <hi>Phocas</hi> and <hi>Brunichild,</hi>
would likewise degrade him from Saintship: and if
one will examine the pretended Saint <hi>Clovis,</hi> by such
strict Rules, not only his Saintship, but even his
Christianity would be doubted: And we should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that S. <hi>Remy</hi> had rather brought a Reproach, than
an Honour on our Christian Religion, by Baptizing
him. If one will summ up all the Blemishes even of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
Life, and pretend to give his Character, by laying
these together, instead of concluding him a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to God's own Heart, one should rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him to be one of those whom God abhors. In
short, there are few men so bad, but one may find
enough of good in them, that if that alone were laid
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59665:15"/>
together, they might pass for not only good Men,
but even for extraordinary Men: If we had only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the beginnings of what <hi>Suetonius</hi> writes of
<hi>Tiberius, Caligula,</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> those Monsters would
have passed for Patterns. On the other hand,
there are few Men so good, but that if all the
Weaknesses of their Life, were set out in Bas-Reliefs,
as Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> has dealt with <hi>Cranmer,</hi> without
making the due mixture of Light and Shaddow, of
the Good as well as the Bad, they would make a very
ill appearance.</p>
            <p>And it is certain, that a Man of Wit, can make
either Panegyrick or Satyr where he will, and even
keep himself within the bounds of Truth as to the
main stroaks of his History. So after all that Mr. <hi>de
Meaux</hi> has said of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> I do not doubt, but if a
Man, even biassed with the ill Characters that he has
given of him, will be at the pains to read over my
History, he will return to high thoughts of him,
in spite of all those malignant Colours in which he
has set him out. The Ages in which Men have lived
do very much extenuate some things, as well as other
times aggravate the same faults. Men of Modest
Tempers, have often an oppression on their Spirits,
which looks like fear. And some Men have an ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
over other people, that those who are strong
against all other Considerations, yet cannot resist
them: And this was the case of <hi>Cranmer</hi> towards
<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, who as he was always soft and
gentle, so his Modesty carrying on it the weight of
great obligations, made that he was not at all times
so firm as was necessary, against so imperious a King:
And indeed one of the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> reproaches
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59665:16"/>
               <hi>Cranmer</hi> for this with a very ill Grace, in an Age in
which, if we may believe the Answerer to Mr.
<hi>Talon,</hi> they have shewed not only a compliance
with <hi>Lewis le Grand,</hi> but have vied one with another
in their Admirations and Panegyricks, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so many and high Invasions of the Rights of the
Church, in the most Sacred things; and of the great
steps made towards a breach with that which they
call the <hi>Holy See.</hi> The prejudices of Education hang
long about men: and the notion of adhering to the
Unity, till one can make a general Reform, is
plausible, and the complying with the Rites of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that was antiquated by the Death of Christ,
in which the Apostles themselves went so far, seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to warrant, or at least to excuse a Man, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when the degrees of his Knowledge were yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
suitable to the Age in which he lived, if he
did not all of the sudden emancipate himself: All these
things might induce <hi>Cranmer</hi> to continue in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of many Rites, to which he had been long accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
after they were softned with some Corrections
and Explanations; hoping at last to engage the whole
Nation into an unanimous Reformation. If in all
these things the grounds he went on, are not so sure
as to warrant all he did, yet in that dawn of Light,
a complyance upon such Considerations is not so
heinous a thing, but that he who was guilty of it,
may yet be well reckon'd among the greatest Men
that have been in the Church. Since the Judgments
that we make of Men, ought to be formed, neither
upon some slips they may have made on the one
hand, nor upon some great Actions on the other,
but upon the whole thread and course of their Lives.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59665:16"/>
And as to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> there appeared in him so much Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
and Sincerity, so great a contempt of the World,
and such a neglect of his Family, such a Spirit of
Gentleness and Charity, both to those who differed
from him, and even to his Enemies, such a simplicity
of Spirit, that he would never enter into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
and Factions of Court. Such a constant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to the finding out of Truth, and such a
plainness in acknowledging Mistakes, and submitting
himself to the Correction of others; so much Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Modesty during one and twenty years Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and such an unblemished Purity as to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Deportment, that even the Libels of that time
durst not attempt upon it. All these, of which I had
such copious Discoveries, appeared so extraordinary
to me, that I was not affraid to mix with them all
the instances of Humane Frailty that I found in him.
If I had writ as most of those in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
do, that publish Lives, I should have assumed the
Impudence to have denied some things, and to have
passed over others: And at least I should have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
a great many things that were never known
before I published them. But I write not for Parties or
Persons; I write for Truth's Sake; and so was not affraid
to shew even the weak sides of our Reformers. This
is one of the unsearchable depths of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
to let the Man appear even when God shews
himself. And with how much indignation soever
Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> rejects the consideration that I offered
of S <hi>Peter</hi>'s Denial, to soften the Censure of <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>'s
fall, yet I return to it, and take the Liberty to
say, that considering it was in our Saviour's own
Presence, who had so lately warned him of it, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59665:17"/>
who had parted with his Disciples in so ravishing
a manner, giving them such elevating Instructions,
and ending these with so inflaming a Prayer, who
was also upon the point of Offering up himself a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for the Sins of the World: And whose ill usage
from his Persecutors, ought in a most particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to have softned and melted his Disciples, who
saw it. Besides that, nothing could more betray the
Reputation of our Saviour's Innocency, than his
being denied by one of his Disciples, which lookt
as if he was ashamed of him. And after all, that the
Temptation was so weak, the Accusation of a Maid and
some that stood near her, and that the Denial was
confirmed with Oaths and Imprecations; I still doubt
if <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Fall is capable of so many aggravations,
and therefore as the meanness of Man, and the
greatness of God and of his Grace, appeared in S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
Fall and in his Repentance, and his being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
restored to that sublime Dignity, from which he
had fallen; so I doubt not but that God suffered <hi>Cranmer</hi>
in his old Age, after a long and hard Imprisonment, and
that he had seen some of his Brethren burnt before his
Eyes, to fall; that so he might by his Mighty Power
raise him again, and in him teach us to cease from
Man, for wherein is he to be accounted of; and that
such as glory might glory in the Lord and not in
Man. As for the difference that is alledged as
to the Time, that the one was but for a moment,
and that the other lasted longer, it is to be consider'd
that our Saviour lookt presently at Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and
the Authority of that look, together with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Vertue that might accompany it, and the
Crowing of the Cock, were such extraordinary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59665:17"/>
that it had been a wonder indeed, if Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> had resisted them; and we may Charitably
believe, that if <hi>Cranmer</hi> had been blessed with such
awakening Motives, he had likewise Repented sooner
than he did. So that upon the whole matter, I do
not see any one Action in all <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Life, unless
it be his consenting to the Divorce of <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve,</hi>
in which it does not appear that he adhered strictly
to a Principle of Conscience, tho' it is a question if that
Principle was always well measured or not: But that
is nothing to the probity of the man, so long as he
adheres to that which he thinks right: And even in
that of <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve,</hi> as it was the body of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Clergy that did it, so that his part was only a
giving a too feeble consent; so he, believing that
Marriage was no Sacrament, might think it subject
to Political Regulations; especially when it was not
consummated; so that the rights of Nature did not
seem concerned: Whether this is to be defended
or not, I will not determine: But certainly this
is not so odious a matter, as Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> would
make it appear to be. And for his dissolving the
Marriage of <hi>Anne Bullen,</hi> the Record of that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is lost, so that we do not know what it was
that she confessed; and therefore here Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi>
studies to defame <hi>Cranmer</hi> upon conjecture; and
yet I suppose that he himself would think that he
met with hard measure, if he were censured, much
less condemned, upon Reports, Presumptions, or
Conjectures.</p>
            <p>As for all the good Characters that Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi>
gives of our Sinods, I shall only crave leave to tell
him, that if one would examine not only the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59665:18"/>
of <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> or to go a little higher,
the second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and some antienter Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
as he has done ours, they would find not only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
Weaknesses, and Passions, but down right
Impostures in them. In short, it has appeared that
Man was Man even in the best Ages, and in the most
Celebrated Assemblies of the Church; and I will not
stick to own it freely, that if I had not a great Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for the first four General Councils, for the
sake of the Truths that they decreed, I should never
pay them much, when I consider their Method of
Proceeding, which appears but too evidently to those
who have read the Journals of the third and fourth:
and if we Judge of the first, by the mutual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
which they exhibited to <hi>Constantine,</hi> and
which he to their Reproach destroyed; or of the
second, by their way of treating St. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianze,</hi>
who was one of the greatest Men of the Age,
and that had done the most for the Truth in the former
Persecution under <hi>Valens,</hi> we will not form a very
favourable Opinion neither of the one nor the other
of those two great Assemblies.</p>
            <p>But since I have named that Great Man, I will
let Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> see how easie it is, to give an ill
Character even of the greatest Men. I will not
mention his indecent Invectives against <hi>Iulian,</hi> nor
his high Eloges of <hi>Constance.</hi> But if we consider his
Life after he was a Bishop, he despised <hi>Zasim</hi> where
he was first setled, and was offended with his Friend
S. <hi>Basil</hi> for putting him in it; and in the end he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
it, for it was a mean place, and a Town full of
disorders, as being situated on the great Road. After
that he came and assisted his old Father at <hi>Nazianze;</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:59665:18"/>
but upon his Death he left that; and without any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
Vocation, he came to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he
acted long as Bishop: And in conclusion, when he saw
it was like to be questioned by the Council, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
indeed: But as appears by his Letter to <hi>Proco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius,</hi>
he grew upon that so disgusted at all Councils,
that he could neither think nor write of them with
patience. Here are many Blots in a Life of which
we have very little left us; and yet after all this, he
was one of the greatest Men, that not only his Age
but the <hi>Greek</hi> Church ever produced.</p>
            <p>But here Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> will complain, that I am
doing that which he apprehends so much, and that I
am recriminating: He had Reason to apprehend this;
for the Subject is Copious, and the Matter is Obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
only with this difference, that a just Recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
destroys the whole bottom on which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church is founded, for the certainty of Tradition,
and the Infallbility of the Church, being their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
if Variations are proved among them, these
are shaken; and so their whole Fabrick falls: but Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations
even proved among us, signifie nothing,
they only prove that the Reformers were Men, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to mistakes; that in some things they might bend
matters too far, in opposition to that which they
saw Reason to Condemn, before they had so clearly
discovered the Truth that was wrapped up in so
much Corruption; that it was to discern the
Truths, which might have carried <hi>Cranmer</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to the Ecclesiastical Tyranny, to raise the
Power of the Civil Magistrate too high: In other
points they thought they might retain some recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59665:19"/>
expressions, giving them sound Explanations;
and so change the Ideas of things, without change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Language: And thus tho' they retained the
<hi>Real Presence,</hi> with some other Phrases that were
consonant to it, yet they gave it another Sense:
And Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> ought not to make so much as he
does of their Submission to some Princes; when, not
to mention the base compliances of some Bishops in
this Age, who are indeed a Reproach to their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
nor what was mentioned formerly of <hi>Gregory</hi>
and <hi>Remy,</hi> even the Apostle of <hi>France,</hi> S. <hi>Martin</hi>
himself, complied with the Tyrant <hi>Maximus</hi> in such a
manner, that, as <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> sets it out, it
does little Honour to his Memory: Only in this he
differed from the Bishops of this present Age, that he
interposed vigorously to hinder the Persecution of a
Sect, that had neither Laws nor Edicts in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
and that are represented in History as a very
odious sort of Men, and indeed not worthy to live;
whereas in our days, we have seen Bishops not only
pushing on a Prince to an Infamous violation of
Edicts, and to an unheard of Cruelty, but making
Panegyricks upon it, while others were most Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
denying it, even at the same time that they
were writing private Letters in defence of it. These
are indeed unworthy and scandalous Compliances,
and yet those who are guilty of them, have the
Face to Reproach us for things that are not to be
once named in comparison with them: So true does
the Character of a <hi>Pharisee</hi> remain to this day,
of warning others to take the Mote out of their
Eye, while there is a Beam in their own. Among
all the Compliances in <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi>'s Reign, is there
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59665:19"/>
any one that carries with it such a Reproach to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as it is for the Bishops of a whole Church, (one
or two perhaps only excepted) to see Men required
to Receive the Sacrament by the force of Royal
Edicts, (in particular, by that Famous Monument of
the Impiety and Inhumanity of the Age, against those
who refused to receive it in their Sickness.) By which
those from whom the violences of Dragoons had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
a Signature, are required to do that, which
in the Opinion of all Christians, is a high Profanation
of the Sacrament, but in the Opinion of that Church,
is a Prophanation without a name, and beyond all
that can be set out in words. This is an Edict re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the Sacredest of all the Acts of Worship,
and is a higher Invasion of the Sanctuary, than any
that can be found in all King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Reign: And
yet those who Reproach us so severely, have not had
the Honesty nor the Courage, to interpose and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
their Clergy not to give the Sacrament to any
but to such as were duely prepared for it, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
their Doctrine, and came to Receive it with
that disposition of Mind which became them. The
Silence of those Bishops upon so Sacrilegious an
Attempt, is an indication of a Slavish compliance,
far above all that they can Charge on <hi>Cranmer:</hi> As
for those Tragical Exclamations that Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi>
makes on the Supremacy, that was declared to be
in our Kings, as well in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time,
as in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s, and King <hi>Edward</hi>'s, this is also
very unjustly urged by a Clergy, that suffer under
a much greater Invasion of the Rights of the Church,
than any that we can complain of. By the Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date,
the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have Invaded the Liberties
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59665:20"/>
of that Church, and have assumed to themselves the
Nomination of all the Bishops of <hi>France;</hi> and by the
Pretensions to the Regale, they have assumed also a
right of conferring Spiritual Employments, to which
a care of Souls is annexed, and that <hi>pleno jure.</hi>
Their Courts of Parliament are the last resort even
of all Spiritual Matters; and receive all Appeals under
the pretence of some abuse in the Sentence, so that the
whole Exercise of the Episcopal Power is subject to
the Secular Court. And whatsoever they may talk
of their Union with the Holy See, even in this they
are also Subject to the Secular Court, since no Bull
or Breve can be Executed in <hi>France,</hi> without an
approbation from thence. And yet these are the
men that complain of the King's Supremacy among
us: tho' there is nothing clearer, than that this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude
lies much heavier on them than it does on us.
For after all, we live under a Legal Government,
by which even our Kings are bound, so that any
Order that comes from them, whether in Matters
Temporal or Spiritual, that is not founded on Law,
or that is contrary to it, is null of it self. The
King's Supremacy among us, amounts to no more,
than that the Execution of the laws that relate to
Religion, and to the Persons of Church men, belongs
to our Kings. And all the difference between the
<hi>French</hi> Constitution and ours, as to this, is, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the <hi>French</hi> King Acts Arbitrarily in those Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ours are limited by Law. So that if a Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is legally proved to be guilty of a Crime, our
King indeed orders the Law to pass upon him in his
Courts of Justice: But the King can shut up no Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in Prisons, or detain them there during Pleasure.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59665:20"/>
We do not know what those Letters of the <hi>Cachet</hi>
are, nor the Exiles or Imprisonments which go
according to the Pleasure of a King, and the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of a Father Confessor. We retain the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the Elections of our Bishops, there being
only a Temporal punishment laid on us by Law, if
we do not follow the King's Recommendation. And
except in Matters of Marriages, an Appeal from the
Spiritual Court is scarce ever heard of in <hi>England:</hi>
And even when an Appeal is brought, it is to be Judged
by Delegates, that are named by the King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
a considerable number of whom are always
Bishops. Nor have our Parliaments or our Princes
medled any other way in Matters of Religion, but
that they have given the Civil Sanction to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
made by the Church, and this is that which
all Christian Princes do in all places; so that after all
the Clamour that is made on our being Subjected to
the Civil Power, it is certain, that the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church is
much more Subject to it than we are. And yet these
Men, who have abandoned all the Immunities of the
Church, Reproach us with <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> tho' there
is not one of them that dares make any one of those
steps which procured to him his Saintship. These
Men do also swear the Oath that is in the Pontifical
to the Pope, of which Mr. <hi>Claud</hi> put Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> in
mind long ago; but he is Wiser than to take any
notice of a thing which he knows he cannot answer,
for I would gladly see how they observe any one of all
the Articles that are in that Oath. Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> is
offended at <hi>Cranmer</hi> for the Protestation that he made,
explaining to what degree he thought himself bound
to observe it; and yet tho' he and his Brethren swore it,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59665:21"/>
it does not appear that it makes any great impression
on their Consciences: They are resolved to have no
regard to it, only they cannot endure <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s
Honesty for protesting to that purpose: But if they
fail in this part of their Oath, they have been most
exactly true to another Branch of it, which obliges
them to Persecute Hereticks to the utmost of their
Power.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears, how just it was for Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi>
to apprehend that we should Recriminate: And that in
all points, the Recrimination falls much heavier on their
Church, than the Charge it self can fall on ours. He
takes notice of an Objection that he finds I made
upon the Subject of those prejudices, which is, that
if we enter on a Personal Dispute, concerning the
Reformers, the worst things that even their Enemies
can lay to their charge, come far short of those
Enormous Crimes, of which even their own Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
confess their Popes to have been Guilty; and
that, some times in a Series of many Ages together;
in which not so much as one good Pope Interveened;
so uninterrupted was that Succession. Now Popes
being, according to the general Doctrine of that
Church, the Infallible Oracles of Truth, and the
Universal Bishops; and according to all the rest of
their Communion, they being the Heads of the
Church, Christ's Vicars, and the Centers of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
they are much more concerned in all that
relates personally to their Popes, than we are in the
Lives of our Reformers: All that Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> says
to this, is, that the Reformers are the Authors of
our Sect, and that therefore we are more immediately
concerned in them. But it seems Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:59665:21"/>
understands the Principles of the Reformation very
ill. We own no Sect, but that of which Jesus Christ
is the Author: And we have no other Interest in
the Reformers, but that they were Instruments by
whose Means the World was awakened to Read the
Scriptures, and to examine Matters of Religion: And
that they discovered many things of which the World
was formerly ignorant, and in which the Clergy
studied still to keep them in a blind Subjection to
them; and since they found too much advantage in
those Corruptions to be willing to part with them,
the Reformers went on in their Discoveries, and at
length by the Blessing of God, and the Labours of the
Reformers, as well as by the Persecution of their
Enemies, this Work had so great a Progress, that it
will still be reckoned one of the wonders of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.
But after all, the Reformers were only the
Instruments of opening this Light, but not at all the
Authors of our Sect, so that we are no other way
concerned in them, but that we gratefully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
their Labours, and honour their Memory:
And what Mistakes, Weaknesses, or Passions soever
may have mixed with their Conduct, this proves
nothing, but that they were Men, and were Subject
both to Sin and to Errour.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> is also at a great deal of pains, to
shew how unsteady the Protestants have been in
setling some Notions, in particular the manner of
Christ's Presence in the Sacrament, and the true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Church, on which he enlarges himself very
copiously: But is it possible that he is so ignorant,
either of Antiquity, or of the Age of the School-Men,
as not to know how long they were before
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59665:22"/>
they setled on almost all the Notions of Divinity?
<hi>F. Petaw</hi> can inform him, how dark the Fathers of
the first three Centuries were even in their Idea's of
the Trinity; and it were easie to shew, that even
after the Definition of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> it was
long before they setled on the same Notion of the
Unity of the Divine Essence, with that which has
been received now for many Ages in the Church. It
were easy to shew, how even the so much cited and
admired Saint <hi>Austin</hi> differed from himself, in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputes
with the <hi>Manicheans,</hi> the <hi>Donatists,</hi> and the
<hi>Pelagians;</hi> and that one sees in his works very different
Notions, not only of the Freedom of the Will, but
even of the Nature of the Church. When he writ
against the <hi>Donatists,</hi> who had contrary to all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
broke the Peace of the Church, he raised the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Church, and the submission to the visible
Authority that was in it, very high: But when he
writ against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> the invisible Assembly of the
Elect was the Church. Any Man that has been at the
pains to Read all that he has writ on these Heads from
end to end, and that has not only pickt up here and
there some quotations that are drawn out of him, must
needs find so much confusion in him, that they will
easily pardon others, if any such disorder appears in
the Writings of the Reformers: And for the Notion
of the Presence in the Sacrament, there has appeared of
late such a History of the Disorders of the Schoolmen,
before they came to settle on the Notion of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,
and even in the explanation of that after
the fourth Council of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> that it will give no
great Reputation to any Man, that will take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
from the Variations that may have been
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59665:22"/>
among us; when it appears that there have been
Changes of another Nature among them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> is so pleased with this Prospect of the
Variations among us, that he will even make the
suppressing of a more copious condemnation of the
Corporal Presence, that had been made in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s
time, but was left out in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s, to
pass likewise for one. The Matter of Fact was this,
in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, both Transubstantiation, and
the Corporal Presence, were expresly rejected in our
Articles, and it was declared that Christ was present
only in a Spiritual Manner, and that he was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Faith alone: when Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to
the Crown, it was thought enough to reject both
Transubstantiation, and the Adoration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;
it was also declared that the Wicked did not
receive Christ's Body or Blood in the Sacrament:
That he was present only after a Heavenly and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
manner, and that the Means by which he was
Received, was Faith: only the rejecting the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Presence with the Reasons upon which it was
rejected, was left out. The Church did not at all
change its Doctrine, but it being fit to put nothing
in the Articles of the Church, but what is necessary,
it had been an unseasonable rigour, to put in them
a long explanation of a Negative Article. The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Articles can only be necessary; and tho' some
Negative Articles ought to be kept in Confessions, if
the Errour rejected by them, is very dangerous; yet
no Man can say that all Negatives ought at all times
to be proposed: So that this is a matter of Discretion
and Prudence, and therefore the Adoration of the
Sacrament, being according to us Idolatry, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59665:23"/>
Transubstantiation leading Naturally to that, these
were still Condemned; that so the Purity of the
Worship might be secured; but this being done, if our
Church had carried the matter further, and had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
on every one the more particular and disputable
Opinions concerning the Presence, she had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
too near to the Rigour of that Church,
from which she had separated her self. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she shewed that Regard both to <hi>Lutherans</hi> and
others, who might have peculiar Notions of a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Presence, as not to put such a Definition in the
body of her Articles, as might drive them out of
her Society: And if she went too far in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s
Time, we are so far from being ashamed of
the Moderation that she shewed in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s
Time, that we rather Glory in it. We are
neither affraid nor ashamed to follow Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
who Circumcised <hi>Timothy,</hi> that by such a compliance
he might gain the <hi>Iews,</hi> and that went to Purifie
himself in the Temple, in which there was always
a Sacrifice of one sort or another, which he did
long after the Vertue and the Obligation of those
Rites was extinguished; and if he went so far in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Compliances, the Silence of our Church in a
Negative Article, when done upon the considerations
of Charity and Prudence, is rather an Honour than a
Reproach to it. Indeed, it is no wonder to see those
of a Church, that has thundred with her Anathema's
upon the smallest Matters, and has followed these
with all the Cruelties, that either the Rage of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
or the Fury of Inquisitors could invent,
it is no wonder, I say, to see them censure us for
our Gentleness; since by this it appears, that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59665:23"/>
ours is the true Mother, that cannot see her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
cut to pieces.</p>
            <p>But here I stop, I will not go further upon a
Subject that is like to be handled by so able a Pen,
that I am only sorry that such a man should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
so much time upon so Barren a Subject, since it
it must be confessed that this Age has scarce produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
a Book that has been writ with so much pains,
but to so little purpose, and with so little
sincerity. Yet since one has resolved to undertake
it, who I know will manage it with much force
as well as with great Truth, that so his Book may
be in all Respects, the reverse of that which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers;
I will not anticipate further upon him: But
will now add only a little in Vindication of the short
Account which I gave of the Troubles of <hi>France,</hi> on
design to justify the Assistance which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
gave to the Protestants there, upon which Mr. <hi>de
Meaux</hi> thinks that he has great advantages. He Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
me for my Ignorance of the Affairs of <hi>France,</hi>
which he shews first in my calling the Union
of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and the King of
<hi>Navarre,</hi> the <hi>Triumvirat,</hi> but this could have
only made a <hi>Duumvirate;</hi> yet I named the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
whom he has thought fit to pass over, and I
said not one word of a <hi>Triumvirat,</hi> but only mentioned
the Union of these three with Queen <hi>Catherine.</hi> It
is true the Translator has thought fit to add, beyond
what I had said, <hi>par une espece de Triumvirat,</hi> which
shews, that as I am not at all concerned in this
matter, so even my Translator himself, had a mind
to distinguish this from the famous <hi>Triumvirat.</hi> He
also charges me for having accused the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:59665:24"/>
as having designed the Business of <hi>Vassy,</hi> but in my
<hi>English</hi> there is not a word of any premeditated De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and I am only accountable for the <hi>English;</hi> nor
is this plain in the Translation, tho' there is more in
it than in the Original: <hi>Executer leur dessein,</hi> does not
import, that the Business of <hi>Vassy</hi> was preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated,
but only that the Design being laid, the
occasion offered at <hi>Vassy</hi> was laid hold on. It is true,
I do not know how I came to say, that the King of
<hi>Navarre</hi> was declared Regent, I had reason to say,
that the Regency fell to him by Law, and that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
as Mr. <hi>de Thou</hi> observes, in the Famous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
in the Case of <hi>Philip le Valois.</hi> I had also
Reason to say, that the Power of the Regent was
limited, and so I only erred in setting the word Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
for Governour or Lieutenant of the Kingdom.
I am not ashamed to own mistakes, when I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that I have made them. But it will soon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
whether he or I have committed more Errours
in Treating of the Affairs of his own Country: For
in this I will frankly acknowledge my Errour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pretending to excuse my self, from the term
in which Mr. <hi>de Thou</hi> had expressed the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var</hi>'s
Imployment <hi>praeses regni,</hi> now this seemed to
answer to the <hi>English</hi> term, of <hi>Protector of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
in whom the true Regency lies, tho' there is
another Imployment among us, in the Minority of
our Kings, of him who is the <hi>Governour of his Person,</hi>
which is independent on the other: And has been
oft in another hand, upon which a Famous Dispute
arose, between the two Brothers in <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th</hi>'s
Minority: Yet I confess frankly, that this is only an
excuse, and not a justification.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:59665:24"/>
But whereas Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> reproaches me for
citing the Opinions of the Lawyers of <hi>France,</hi> against
the Regency of a Woman, and charging it as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence,
in pretending that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> were
not Majors till they were twenty two Years of Age,
against an express Ordinance of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth,
1474. which has ever been held for a Law, thro'
the whole Kingdom, without contradiction, as he
assures us; In this he shews how little he has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
the Matters of that time, and how carelesly
he has Read Mr. <hi>de Thou:</hi> It would indeed appear,
that he has only turned to that place which opens the
Business of <hi>Ambaise;</hi> for he cites Mr. <hi>de Thou</hi>'s Words,
relating to the Opinions that were given by the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Resolutions of
the Protestant Divines, which is in his twenty fourth
Book. But if he had Read his twenty third Book, in
which the Administration of Affairs under <hi>Francis</hi> the
Second is set forth, he had found all that which I
cited, concerning the Opinions of the Lawyers of
<hi>France:</hi> 
               <q>For he gives us a large Abstract, of a
Book that was writ in the end of <hi>October 1559,</hi>
against the share that Women and Strangers had
in the Government; proving also that the Kings
of <hi>France</hi> were not of Age, till they were 25 years
Old; and that tho' <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth had made
a Constitution for his Son's being Major at four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
and had also by his Will named <hi>Lewis</hi> of
<hi>Bourbon</hi> to be his Regent, in our <hi>English</hi> Sense, the
Government of the Kingdom being left to the
Duke of <hi>Anjou;</hi> yet no Regard was had to this,
for the young King was put into the hands of the
Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and the very name of the Regency
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59665:25"/>
was taken from the Duke of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and the
King was not declared to be Major, till he was
twenty two years of Age: And the Historians of
that time do expresly say, that the States declared
him Major at that Age, because of the Graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Person, and the Love that was generally
born him.</q> The Reader may, if he pleases, Read
the rest of the Extract that Mr. <hi>de Thou</hi> gives, both
of that Book, and of Mr. <hi>du Tillet</hi>'s Answer, and of
the Reply made to <hi>du Tillet,</hi> and it is plain, that
Mr. <hi>du Thou</hi> favours the side of the first Book, and
Censures Mr. <hi>du Tillet</hi> as much as became so Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
an Historian to do: And in Conclusion, he
saies, that upon the occasion of the Disputes that
followed in <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth's Minority, the
Chancellour <hi>Hospital</hi> took care to have the Decree
inserted among the Royal Edicts: And thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth's Edict was of no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
according to the Constitutions of <hi>France,</hi> as
long as their Antient Laws were in force. But it
may now pass for a Law, in a Nation, where <hi>tel
est nostre plaisir,</hi> is the measure of the Government:
And by this it may be judged, whether Mr. <hi>de
Meaux</hi> or I have read Mr. <hi>de Thou,</hi> or reported this
matter, according to the Laws of <hi>France</hi> more
exactly. But Mr. <hi>de Thou</hi> is too Impartial a Writer,
for a man of Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Temper, and indeed the
<hi>French</hi> Nation has gone in, so entirely into all
the Notions of Slavery in this Age, that they seem
not only to have forgot their Antient Liberties,
but even to be uneasy, when any others put them in
mind of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:59665:25"/>
I will now put an end to all that I was to say
at present with Relation to Mr. <hi>de Meaux:</hi> But
since he has thought fit to insinuate, what perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
were expected from Mr. <hi>le Grand,</hi> I will add
somewhat relating to him; tho' I cannot yet give
him such a Copious Answer as I find is expected
from me.</p>
            <p>Both my Books and Papers are in <hi>England,</hi> so
I cannot do what I intend, till I am furnished with
some helps that I hope to receive e're long; yet to
let Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> see, that I have not forgotten him, I
will give you here some Essaies of his Sincerity. He
has Published a Volume of Letters and other Pieces,
which he gives as the proofs of his Work, tho' not
above a third part of them belongs to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
in hand: In short, he got many Letters in his
hand writ from <hi>England,</hi> which he resolved to
Print, that so he might raise both the Bulk and
the Price of his Book: A big Book makes an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
and People think when they see much
Bulk, that there is much said: And yet even of these
Letters, some were Published by me, and others
were Printed before: And the greater part has no
Relation, neither to the Affairs of the Divorce, nor
any other of the Affairs of <hi>England,</hi> but contain
only Advices concerning the Affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> and
the Commerce between the two Crowns in their
common Concerns. He has also given, for the most
part, only the Letters that were writ to the <hi>Great
Master,</hi> without giving us those that were writ to
the King, or the Secretary of State, in which we
might hope to find the Copious Accounts of the
State of Affairs; whereas the Letters writ to other
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59665:26"/>
Ministers, contain only private Advices that are
offered to them; but whether Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> ever
saw these to the King, or not, I do not know, tho'
it is probable that those who preserved the one,
would likewise have taken care of the other. He
has not given us the Series of the Letters that
were writ from <hi>Marseilles</hi> during the Interview,
which he ought not to have suppressed, if they
fell under his Eye.</p>
            <p>But besides all the Defects and the Excesses of
that Volume, Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> is liable to a severer
Censure, for the Abstracts that he pretends to give
from them: I shall name but three. In the first
of all that he has put in his Volume of Proofs, one
should have expected some exactness, for many are
apt to read the first, that will not give themselves
the trouble to go further: And therefore he ought
to have taken a little more care of this than he
has done, and not have given such an unfaithful
Extract of it: I pass over that which he saies of
<hi>Pace</hi>'s having neither regard to the Vulgar
<hi>Latine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hist. de Di<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. p. 46.</note> nor to the Seventy, but only to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew:</hi>
There being nothing in the Letter to that
purpose, for he only corrects the Notion of some,
who from the Title of the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi>
inferred, that this according to the composition of the
<hi>Greek</hi> word, signifying a second Law, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Laws of <hi>Leviticus</hi> were abrogated by those
in <hi>Deuteronomy:</hi> and let the Reader judge, if this
is a disparaging either of the Vulgar or the Seventy.
But he commits a fault of another Nature, when
to represent the Corruptions of the Divines of
<hi>England</hi> at that time, he saies that <hi>Wakfield (soû<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haîtoit
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59665:26"/>

King himself would write to him, what it was that
he would have him do, and if he would have him
write for him or against him, and that according
to the Orders that he should receive from him,
he would give him such Informations, either for
or against him, as should exceed the Capacity
of all the <hi>English.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now because this seems so extravagant a Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I will set down the words of the <hi>Latine</hi> Letter,
with their Translation in <hi>English:</hi> And then I will
leave it to every Reader, to think what Judgment he
ought to form of Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> upon it, <hi>D. R.</hi> Wacfeldus
<hi>nunc me rogavit ut sibi significarem, a placeret tibi
veritatem hac in re intelligere? i. utrum staret a te
a contra te? ei ita respondi, te nihil velle quod esset
alienum a Nobile Principe, &amp; singularibus virtutibus
praedito: Illumque Maj. tuae, rem gratissimam factu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
si laboraret ut puram veritatem tibi declarat:
Tum ille nescio quo ductus timore, negavit se hoc posse
facere, nisi Maj. tua, id sibi injungeret &amp; mandaret:
Et si mandares, se producturum in medium, tam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
te, quam pro te, illa quae nemo alius in hac tuo
Regno producere posset.</hi> 
               <q>The English of this is,
<hi>D. R. Wakfield</hi> desired me earnestly to let him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
whether your Majesty desired to know
the Truth in this Matter? that is to say, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Truth was for You or against You?
To whom I answered thus, that you desired
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59665:27"/>
nothing that was unbecoming a Great and an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently
Vertuous Prince: And that he would
do a most acceptable thing to your Majesty, if
he would declare to you the Verity. But he,
upon what fearfulness I know not, said that he
could not do that, unless Your Majesty would
Command him to do it: And that if you did lay
your Commands on him, he would lay before
you, both what made for and against you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
what any Man in the Nation could do.</q>
Now whether Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi>'s Errors, here flow from a
want of Sincerity, or from his Ignorance of
<hi>Latine,</hi> I do do not know: But certainly, never
was a Letter worse handled than he has done this;
since the Matters contained in it, are highly both
to the King's Honor, and to <hi>Wakfield</hi>'s; which yet he
has turned so maliciously. Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> has thrown out
upon me all the Reproaches, with which a Clounish
Temper, and a Mean Education could furnish him;
not forgetting the common Figure of a <hi>brazen fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi>
But I do not envy him those Beauties of
Stile, only if I were to make use of a Figure for
him, I must seek it from other Bodies that are
more impenetrable than Brass, for it will grow
red before a fire; but I do not know whether such
a Discovery as this will set him a Blushing or
not.</p>
            <p>His second Letter is produced, to prove, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
to me, that Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> desired that
the Pope would make him his Vicar General during
his Imprisonment, and that this was long before the
time that I make him pretend to it;<note place="margin">Hist. de Di<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

thought so important, that he comes over it twice.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59665:27"/>
This is no great matter, if it was true; and would
only prove that he had found out some Papers, which
I never saw: But it is somewhat extraordinary to
see him produce a Letter for proving this, that
does not so much as contain one word relating to
it. The Letter which is the second among his
Proofs, is indeed an address made to the Pope by
five Cardinals, desiring him to give them a Power,
to supply his absence by a Commission from him,
<hi>suamque absentiam demandata Authoritatis presentia sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plere.</hi>
But there is not so much as an Insinuation of
recommending Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> to it, nor is there any
mention made of a Vicar General, much less of all
that long Extract that Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> gives of it: But
by these Indications, I suppose, you will conclude
how little regard there is to be had to his Extracts,
even when he makes them with the greatest Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
But the third Instance, is yet both more notorious
and more important. It relates to the Decision made
by the <hi>Sorbonne.</hi> Indeed, the Abstract that Mr. <hi>le
Grand</hi> gives of that whole Matter in his History,
differs so much from the account given in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which he brings to prove it, that he must have a
strange Opinion of his Readers understanding, and
think that it is of a piece with his own Sincerity,
if he expects that much credit will be hereafter
given to any of his Extracts. For the account which
he gives of President <hi>Lizet</hi>'s Letter, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
extraordinary even for Mr. <hi>le Grand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Letter it appears,<note place="margin">Preuves p. 480.</note> that he sent the Act to
the King, and after he had mentioned that, he
adds this, with Relation to the management of the
Business, <q>he prays the Great Master, that as to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59665:28"/>
the Account which the Bishop of <hi>Bayonne</hi> had
drawn up of that matter, they would suspend
their judgment for the Reasons mentioned in his
Letters to the King; till the King had heard from
him, how the matter was managed, and then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it would appear, <hi>that the Information would
rather be a prejudice than an advantage to the King of</hi>
England.</q> It is plain that these last words belong
not at all to the Act it self, but to the conduct of the
matter;<note place="margin">Hist. de Di<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

               </note> and the Caballing that had been about it: But
Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> will apply these words to the Act it
self in his History, in these words, <q>yet he [the
President] took out the Act, and sent it to the
King, without communicating it to <hi>Messieurs de
Bellay,</hi> and advertised his Majesty, that this
would hurt the King of <hi>England</hi> much more than
it would serve him.</q> By this sincerity the Reader
may judge of the rest; when he makes the President's
Reflections on the Conduct of the Matter, fall upon
the Act it self: And would make that an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Evidence,
to prove that the Act which was Printed in <hi>England,</hi>
cannot be this which is mentioned by the President,
since it is entirely for the King. But Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> has
now furnished us with a proof, that an Act was
passed in the <hi>Sorbonne:</hi> Now is it Credible, that if an
Act which had passed with so much opposition, was
falsely Printed in <hi>England,</hi> that either the whole
Body of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> or at-least that <hi>Beda</hi> and
those who opposed it, would not quickly have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the Imposture: So that Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> without
thinking on it, has given us a proof of the Authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calness
of the Decision, that was Printed in the
name of the <hi>Sorbonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:59665:28"/>
I will enlarge no further in Reflecting on the rest
of the proofs that he has given us, only a digression
that he has made upon one of them, to tell us of
the Dignity of the Family of <hi>Verjus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 5<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and that
<hi>F. Verjus</hi> was of it, looked so affected, that I could
not forbear enquiring a little after it: And I will
give this account that I have of it: Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi>
has let some Jesuits of the Court of <hi>England</hi> know,
what great Services he could do them in destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Credit of my History, but in order to that,
he hoped they would make his Fortune at the same
time: So a powerful recommendation was obtained,
which is lodged in <hi>F. Verjus</hi>'s hands, Secretary to
<hi>F. de la Chaise,</hi> to be made use of as occasion offers
it self: And therefore he bestowed this Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on that Jesuite, to quicken him, in order to
his Advancement. I have been also informed, that
this is the Reason that made his Book stick so long
in the Press, that so he might manage the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the best Advantage. It is also said, that all
the foul Language that he bestows on me, comes
from the same Consideration; and was put in, to
make the Work so much the more acceptable to
those that are to recommend him. I confess, I wondred
at first, to see a Man use me so ill, with whom I
had lived Civilly, and to whom I had given no
cause of offence. But since I am told that he was
hired to it, tho' I cannot highly esteem him for
that, yet I will do all that I can for him, which
is heartily to forgive him: And perhaps the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
that he must suffer, by the discoveries
that I am forced to make of his Mistakes, may
contribute to heighten his Pretensions, and to supply
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59665:29"/>
the want of Merit. In his Defence of <hi>Sanders,</hi>
he charges me for not consining my self to the
first Edition, and for fastning my Censures on
what was added in the subsequent Editions:
But it is not yet known, whether the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Editions were not fuller Copies of <hi>Sanders</hi>'s
own Composing, in which he added much to
the first Fable that he writ, or if they were
added by others afterwards: And there is reason
to believe, that the first Impression was from an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Copy, and that soon after a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
one appeared, and all the Editions of that
Book since that time, as well as the Translations
of it, and in particular the late one by <hi>Maucroix,</hi>
which gave the first occasion to my Writing,
having been made according to that second Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I had Reason to follow it: But after all, I
marked in general, a great difference that was
between the first and the succeeding Editions:
It is true, I did not think it necessary upon every
passage, to mark in which of them that was to
be found. I had indeed prepared a <hi>Sanders</hi> for
another Impression, in which I intended to have
marked in a different Character, the variations in
the several Editions of that Book; but our Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellers
had no mind to meddle with a Book which
they told me I had rendred unsaleable: by this
the half of the Defences which Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> makes
for <hi>Sanderus,</hi> because the Articles to which I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
are not in the first Edition, are blown up;
since I was obliged to destroy the Credit of the
Book that had been for almost an Age received for
<hi>Sanders</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:59665:29"/>
But after Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> had entertained his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with an Account of <hi>Sanders,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Def. de <hi>Sand.</hi> p 9. and 20. Art. 62. Ref. de <hi>Bur.</hi> p. 18.</note> he accuses me
for a passage that I had cited out of an Answer
that was made to <hi>Sanders,</hi> which he tells me he
did not find in it, and this he thought so important,
that he comes over it again and again, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
me almost in the form of a Challenge, to
make it good.</p>
            <p>The matter is this, I had said that <hi>Bonner</hi> had
spoke so vigorously to the Pope at <hi>Marseilles,</hi> that
the Pope thought either to burn him, or to cast
him into a Cauldron of Boiling Lead. For which
I had cited a Book, in which Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> saies
he does not find it. It is true, there were two Books
writ against <hi>Sanders,</hi> both Printed in the same
Year, and in the same form, by <hi>Day 1573.</hi> And
both commonly bound together; the one is
the Book which I cited, and the other is <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanderus:</hi>
Now it seems I mixed my Extracts out
of both these together, so that indeed, the words
are not in the Book which I Cited, but they are
in the other, <hi>p. 195. Bonnerus tam audacter asseruit
nullum esse' Pontifici jus in Ecclesias Anglicanas, ut
de eo vel igne cremando, vel in plumbum lique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factum
mittendo deliberaretur.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Def. de <hi>Sand.</hi> p. 51</note> Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
knew this, for he cites <hi>Antisanderus,</hi> as if
he had Read it. A little after this, Mr. <hi>le
Grand</hi> studies to let his Reader see how ill he
understands <hi>Latine,</hi> for he pretends that <hi>Bacon</hi>
gives the same Account of <hi>P. Arthur</hi>'s Age with
<hi>Sanders,</hi> and sets down both their words, the
former saies, <hi>erat annorum circiter quindecem;</hi> now
<hi>circiter</hi> is either on this side or beyond fifteen, so
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59665:30"/>
this is true, tho' he was some Months past it;
but <hi>Sanders</hi>'s words are, <hi>decimum quintum aetatis
annum vix dum attingens,</hi> which necessarily import
that he was not yet fifteen: This is indeed of no
great consequence, only it shews Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi>'s
good Sense in bringing Proofs for what he saies.
But the next I shall mention,<note place="margin">Def. de <hi>Sand.</hi> Art. 37. Ref. de <hi>Bur.</hi> Art. 18.</note> which he likewise
Repeats twice, as he does most things in which he
thinks he has an advantage against me, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Proof of his Candor. I had said, <hi>P. Iulius</hi>
the Second, had such a Hatred to <hi>France,</hi> that
he was thereby the more easily induced to grant
the Bull for King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Marriage, by which a
League against <hi>France</hi> might be made the stronger;
and upon this he insults upon the <hi>Poor</hi> Mr. <hi>Burnet,</hi>
that he <hi>Poor Man,</hi> had heard that Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> was a
great Enemy to <hi>France,</hi> and thereupon he fancies
he was so from the beginning; whereas he assures
him that the Cardinal of <hi>Rouen</hi> helped him to the
Pontificate, and that so at first he was in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests
of <hi>France.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Burnet, Poor Man</hi> as he
is, takes this from <hi>Raynaldus,</hi> who saies expresly,
and which is more,<note place="margin">Ad An. 1503. Num. 11. &amp; 22.</note> cites Authors to prove it, that
the Cardinal of <hi>Rouen</hi> himself had aspired, but
that <hi>Iulius</hi> was preferred to him; and the same
Author saies, that he granted the Bull for the
King of <hi>England</hi>'s Marriage, which was proposed to him
as a mean for bearing down the <hi>French,</hi> and for
strengthning the Party against them, <hi>ad deprimendos
Gallos confirmandasque adversus eos vires communes.</hi>
Upon the occasion of the Bull, I had said that
<hi>Isabel</hi> of <hi>Castile,</hi> is called <hi>Elizabetha</hi> in it. I neither
said more nor less upon this, nor made I any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59665:30"/>
upon it, and my Design in it, was occasioned
by a Discourse that I had once had with some who
pretended that these were different names;<note place="margin">Hist. de Div. p. 125. Def. de <hi>Sand.</hi> Art. 35. Rej. de <hi>Bur.</hi> Art. 11.</note> and
yet in three or four places, Mr. <hi>le Grand,</hi> according
to his usual Sincerity, and with his cold Railery, of
calling me an <hi>able Man</hi> for it, has said, that I have
made that an Argument, to prove that the Bull
was a Forgery.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> Reproaches me, for saying that the
Count of <hi>Tholouse</hi> was the first that felt the effects
of the fourth Council of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> and shews me
that he was Censured and Deposed before that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
But this shews how unfit he is to Write upon
Critical Matters;<note place="margin">Ad. Con<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Lat. 4. p. 233.</note> what I said is justified by <hi>Cossart's</hi>
Annotations, who says expresly that till then the
Dominions of the Count of <hi>Tholouse</hi> were only se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questred,
but that a Decree was made in that Synod,
translating a great part of them to the Count of
<hi>Monfort</hi> for ever; and for this, he not only Cites
<hi>Petrus Vallisarnensis,</hi> but sends his Reader to <hi>Dachery</hi>'s
<hi>Spicilegium</hi> for the Decree it self. It is true, the Count
of <hi>Tholouse</hi> was Depos'd before that time, but by the
<hi>Feudal</hi> Law, upon his Deposition, either his Heresy
was to be accounted only a Personal Crime, and then
the Fee was to go to the next Heir, or if it was to be
made equal to a Crime of Treason, then the Fee was
to return to the Superiour Lord, and so in this Case
it was to have fallen to the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> but it
was the fourth Council of the <hi>Lateran,</hi> that first
gave the Pope the Power of transferring the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
of Hereticks to others, whereas before that
he could only Depose them. It is also plain, that
Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> treats this whole Matter very mildly,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59665:31"/>
and not with that Detestation that some Writers of that
Church affect, when we reproach them with the
Deposing Power.</p>
            <p>After all, if I have many reasons to complain of
Mr. <hi>le Grand,</hi> I confess there is one, for which I am
much beholden to him; and that is the pains that he
is at to prove the constant Tradition in Catholick
States, to proceed Capitally against Hereticks. This
Book was writ by him chiefly for the <hi>English</hi> Nation,
and if this one thing does not hinder it, it will probably
be put in <hi>English:</hi> But as we are beholden to those who
set on the Persecution of <hi>France,</hi> and must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that we owe our Preservation in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to it, since the Allarm which that gave this
whole Nation, was a stronger Argument than any
that we could have invented for shewing them their
danger, for sensible and barbarous things affect all the
World: But now the Men of the <hi>Mission</hi> think fit to
disclaim the Persecution of <hi>France,</hi> and throw it on
the King's Bigotry, yet taking still great pains to
clear Father <hi>de la Chaise</hi> of it, as if he had alwaies
opposed it, so that we are forced to justify <hi>Lewis le
Grand</hi> in that matter, and to shew that he has acted
in all things Conform to the Doctrine and Spirit of
his Church. This our <hi>Missionaries</hi> deny, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to persuade us, that Liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is the Principle and Doctrine of their Church:
And that therefore we need not apprehend any
mischief from them; that they not only abhor all
Capital Proceedings, but even the Fining of Men, or
the excluding them from Imployments on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Religion; that they cannot forgive those
lesser Severities practised by Men of the Church
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59665:31"/>
of <hi>England,</hi> and that all Men of all Perswasions
may expect to live easy and happy under them.
But Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> has spoiled all this, and thus they
see what it is to imploy Men in their Cause, that
are not yet Initiated into the Mysteries of the
Society, tho' a little common Prudence had preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> from committing such an Errour.
But 'tis not just to expect from Men that which
they have not.</p>
            <p>I will not carry this Censure further at present,
for I have not near me the Books and other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments
that are necessary for a fuller Answer:
And those in <hi>England,</hi> to whom I sent for the
Resolution of some things, have so much work
given them at present, by those, whose Favour
Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi> is Courting, that it is not to be
wondred at, if they have not leisure to send me
the Materials which I wanted. They are in a
Storm, which all the World knows; tho' they are
not yet reduc'd to that which the Reverend
Father <hi>Petre</hi> has threatned them with, in that
Modest and Savoury Expression of his, <hi>That the
Church of</hi> England <hi>shall be made to eat its own
Dung.</hi> This is indeed a true Essay of the Charity
of the Order, and it is that which we have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to expect from it. But I will now put an
end to this long Letter. I am Sir,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have seen Mr. <hi>le Grand</hi>'s Annotations
upon my Letter to Mr. <hi>Thevenot.</hi> I
perceive clearly by it, that this hot Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and his extraordinary Application, have
so dryed his Brain, and given him such an
over flowing of the Gall, that all the answer I
can bestow on him, is to wish his Friends to
look to him, and keep him from running about
the Streets, for he is in a fair way to that.
They will do well to Bleed him over and
over again, to give him some inward Refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives,
and now and then a few Grains of
<hi>Laudanum,</hi> and to take a special care of him
at New and Full Moons. Pen, Ink, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
must be kept from him as poyson, for these
things set his Head so a going, that his Fits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double
upon him at every time that he gets them
in his hands. But above all things, care must
be taken not to name me, nor the <hi>Bibliotheque
Universels</hi> to him, for that will certainly bring
on him a most violent Paroxisme; and he being
Young, and so mightily in love with himself, good
Air and good Keeping, may at last bring him
<pb facs="tcp:59665:32"/>
out of this Raving Distemper. So to be sure I
will have no more to do with a Man that writes
like a Lunatick: Yet as soon as some Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
which I expect shortly from <hi>England</hi> are
brought me, I will answer every thing that he
has said, that looks like Sense: And will not
do as not a few of that Nation have done of
late, who write on without ever justifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or confessing the Errours into which they
have fallen; for I will justifie my self to a
tittle, or acknowledge my Mistakes, as soon as I
find that I have made any.</p>
