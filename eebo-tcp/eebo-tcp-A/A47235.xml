            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36855:4"/>
which brings you to this place, I am sensible how ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a regard I ought to have for you; since you are come within my Fold, in imitation of our most merciful Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who in respect even of our bodily distempers, Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thised with our miseries, <hi>bore our griefs, and carried our sorrows</hi> Isa. liii. 4. Mat. viii. 17.</p>
               <p>For this reason I could not satisfie my self, in only praying for you, as I daily do, unless I did also send you these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and Prayers, which are few, and short, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, to comply with the Infirmites of your Condition, and which I hope by Gods blessing, may be <hi>words

spoken in season</hi>; nor can I doubt, but that All of you who want such helps, will seriously persue them, and observe the advices of your spiritual Physitians, as you are wont to do those of your Corporal.</p>
               <p>Do not think the Baths can do you any good, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods immediate blessing on them; for it is God that must first <hi>heal the waters,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can have any virtue to heal you.</p>

               <p>I cannot then do better, than to send you to that Angel, who according to St. <hi>John, Flyes in the midst of Heaven, having the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth, saying with a loud voice, fear God, and give glory to him, and worship him, that made heaven, and earth, and the Sea, and the fountains of waters,</hi> Rev. xiv.6, 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:36855:5"/>This was the Angel's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and I beseech you to become his Auditors, and to observe how after the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Earth, and the Sea, he particularly menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Springs or <hi>Fountains of waters,</hi> as a very wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful part of the Creation: for out of the dark places of the Earth, through Passages, and from Causes, unknown to the search of the wisest of men, God makes sweet, and fresh Springs to rise, to water the Earth, to give drink to every Beast of the Field, and to supply all the necessities of human Life, and Springs of different kinds, some to allay our thirst, some

               <p>I come Lord, like the blind man to <hi>the Pool of</hi> Siloam; I come, for thou thy self hast sent me, as thou didst send him.

               <p>Lord be thou pleased to guide and counsel my Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian, that he may throughly discover the cause of my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, and prescribe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means for my Recovery, and do thou so bless those means, that in thy good time, they may become suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:36855:8"/>You have great reason to begin with God, not only because he is the Author of the Bath, and can only bless it to your Health; but also because he is the Author of that very Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that brings you hither. <hi>For affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither does trouble spring out of the g<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

It is not a thing that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to us by chance: it does not proceed only from Natural Causes, which are secundary, and instrumental; we must look beyond all these, to the permission, and apointment of Divine Providence, from which it first took its rise, and by
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36855:9"/>
which it is wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted.</p>
               <p>Since then it is certain, that your Affliction comes from God, and it is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that <hi>God does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men,</hi> Lam. iii.33. but that he has always a most Righteous motive, to incline him to afflict them. It very h<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There is no Calamity, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Sickness, or Pain,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36855:9"/>
or Lameness, or the like, that can befall us, but it is the natural consequence of our depraved, frail, mortal condition, and is incident to good Men, as well as to bad; to the former, it is a punishment, to the latter it is a trial.</p>
               <p>Holy Scripture teacheth us, that God has threatened very many, and very sore bodily Diseases to Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Deu.</hi> xviii.58, 59, 60. and that they who are sick, are <hi>stricken by God,</hi> 2 Sam. xii.15. The <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who profaned the blessed Sacrament, were for that cause, <hi>many of them weak, and sickly,</hi> 2 Chron. xxi.18.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36855:10"/>
1 Cor. xi.30. And our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, in his advice he gives to the Man whom he cured of an Infirmity of thirty eight years continuance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates that sin was the cause of that inveterate Disease, <hi>Jo.</hi> v.14.</p>
               <p>But when God is pleased to afflict righteous persons with Sickness, as he did King <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> then Sickness is not an effect of God's Anger, but of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal disciplin towards them, <hi>Ps.</hi> xxxviii.7. <hi>Isa.</hi> xxxviii.1.</p>
               <p>The like may be said of Lameness, which happens by the Divine Direction, to good Men, as well as to the wicked: <hi>King</hi> Asa <hi>who did
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36855:10"/>
that which was good, and right in the eyes of the Lord his God, in the time of his old, age, was diseased in his feet</hi> 1 King. xv.23. <hi>Mephibosheth was lame from five years old,</hi> 2 Sam. iv.4. And the poor Man whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> miraculously healed, <hi>was lame from his mothers womb,</hi> Acts iii.2.</p>
               <p>Since then both Sickness and Lameness are strokes given us by God, to him we must chiefly, and in the first place, betake our selves for Cure; and the Holy Ghost has set a mark of spiritual disgrace on <hi>Asa,</hi> who was otherwise a good King, <hi>That in his disease he

sought not to the Lord, but to the Physicians,</hi> 2 Chr. xvi.12.</p>
               <p>Not that the Scripture does in the least condemn, or discourage our going to the Physicians when we are sick, or our use of all due means for our Recovery. Our Saviour himself, when he says, <hi>They that are whole need not a Physician, but they that are sick,</hi> Mat. ix.12. suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently intimates, that they that are sick did need one.</p>
               <p>The Son of <hi>Sira<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h</hi> gives excellent advice to both the sick and the Physician: <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour a Physician with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due unto him, for the uses which you may have of him,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36855:11"/>
the Lord hath created him, the Lord hath created Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines out of the earth, and he that is wise will not abhor them, and with such doth he heal men, and taketh away their pains,</hi> Ecclus. xxxviii.1. &amp;c. But then he adds, <hi>My son, in thy sickness be not negligent, but pray unto the Lord, and he will make thee whole; leave off from sin, and order thy hands aright, and cleanse thy heart from all wickedness; give a sweet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and a memorial of fine flower; then give place to the Physician. There is a time when in their hands there is good success; for they also shall pray unto the Lord, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36855:12"/>
he would prosper that which they give for ease and remedy, to prolong life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I earnestly recommend to you this Counsel of the Son of <hi>Sirach</hi>; and therefore to you that are sick, or infirm, or lame, I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend Repentance, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Sacrifice; the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Alms, by which you will offer to God <hi>a sweet savour.</hi> To your Physician I also recommend devout Prayer to the Author of Health, and Sickness, that his Physick may pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and then is Physick like to procure a Blessing, when both the Patient, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36855:12"/>
the Physician joyn in their Prayers for it.</p>
               <p>I exhort you to begin with Repentance, and to read De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votional Books on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, of which, blessed be God, there are good store; for it is Repentance that must dispose you for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>The Prophet complains of the obdurateness of those, who, <hi>when God had stricken them, did not grieve,</hi> Jer. v.3. God forbid you should be thus obdurate. God forbid! but since he has <hi>stricken</hi> you, you should <hi>grieve,</hi> and <hi>grieve with that godly sorrow which worketh Repentance to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to be repented of.</hi>

                  </gap>seech you then to examine your selves very seriously, whether you have ever repented of your sins, so as to <hi>bring forth fruits meet for repentance</hi>; for if you are guilty either of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Impenitence, or of an universal relapse into your old sins, or if you lie under the dominion of any one wilful sin, look no further for the original cause of your Distemper: God has in Justice sent it you for your punishment.</p>
               <p>But the most merciful God, <hi>who delights not in the death of a sinner,</hi> in his very Punishments designs rather to awaken, than to destroy
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36855:13"/>
us; and if this punishment, by which God calls you to repentance, does awaken you out of your former se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, it turns to a Blessing, to a happy occasion of your eternal Bliss; be of good cheer then, and repent.</p>
               <p>Your very bodily Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per will present you with a lively Idea of your sins, and Holy Scripture makes use of the former, to picture out to us the latter. Think then of the weakness, and the pain, and the indisposed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the restlessness, and the danger that afflict the sick Man, and compare them with that impotence to good, that anguish of a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36855:14"/>
wounded Spirit, that universal indisposedness to Duty, that restlessness of Conscience, those horrors of eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which attend the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and which without Repentance are for ever incurable; and make this reflection with your self, that if we are so very sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous for the cure of our Bodies, much more ought we to be sollicitous for the cure of our Souls.</p>
               <p>But if your heart does not condemn you, if you are conscious to your self, you have truly repented, and have never <hi>returned to your vomit</hi> again, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge no one wilful sin,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36855:14"/>
and have nothing to accuse your self of, but your daily failings; which are the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable infelicities of lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed nature, and for which you daily beg pardon, then is your Distemper a father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chastisement only, and you ought to rejoyce in it rather than in the least to regret it. However it is your best way to renew your repentance on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and to be sure <hi>to <unclear>bear</unclear> Gods Rod,</hi> and to learn <unclear>that</unclear> Lesson from it, in which you are sensible you were deficient before, and which God has sent this <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

               <p>O Lord God Almighty, who <hi>formest us from the womb, who coverest us there, and seest our substance when imperfect, and all our Members, and how they are curiously formed,</hi> Ps. cxxxix.16. All Glory be to thee.</p>
               <p>I know Lord <hi>that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the Fruit of the womb, are an heritage and gift that cometh of thee,</hi> and therefore of thee only I beg

it; O vouchsafe me that gift in thy good time. Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be to thee O Lord, <hi>who makest the barren Woman to keep House, and to be a joyful Mother of Children.</hi> O that it might please thee, to make me <hi>a joyful Mother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Deliver me, O my God, from either a <hi>barren, or from a miscarrying womb, and from dry Breasts</hi>; and if it be thy will, bless the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that they may dispose me to to be <hi>Fruitful,</hi> and to Conceive; and do thou, O Lord, most tenderly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the <hi>Fruit of my womb,</hi> that I may at last happily bring forth, and may <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:36855:41"/>
my pangs,</hi> and may praise thy Name, <hi>for joy that a Child is born into the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To thee, O Lord God, <hi>do I Vow this Vow, that if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and wilt give unto thy handmaid</hi> Children, <hi>then I will give them unto thee,</hi> 1 Sam. i.11. I will ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devote them to thee in Holy Baptism: I will do my utmost to bring them up in thy nurture and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition; in thy filial Fear, and reverential Love, that they may become instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thy Glory on

Earth, and may at last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Saints in Heaven, to sing eternal praises to thee there.</p>
               <p>Bless me, and my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <hi>O Lord God Almighty, bless us with the blessings of Heaven above, and with the blessings of the deep that lyeth under, bless us with the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of the Breasts, and of the Womb,</hi> if it be thy will.</p>
               <p>O Lord, if thou art plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for most wise and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious purposes, to deny us the blessings of Children; thy most Holy Will be done: O give us an entire contentedness without them;

and though it is not thy pleasure to make us Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in our Bodies, yet make us Fruitful in our Souls, Fruitful in all saving Graces, which will in the end, prove a much greater joy, and comfort, and blessing to us both, than Children. Hear me, O Lord, and help me, and grant my Petition if it be thy Will, for thy infinite Goodness sake, and the sake of Jesus the Son of thy Love. <hi>Amen. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
