         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A TRVE RELATION
OE THE LATE BATTAILE
Before WORCESTER, taken on Sunday laſt, Sept. 25. by a Gentleman
of the Innes of Court, (now in his Excellences Armie) from the mouthes
of Maſter Nathaniel Fynes, and many other Commanders who were in the ſaid Skirmiſh,
and ſent up to Maſter PYM.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon Thurſday, the 22. of September, our Forces being ten Troops of Horſe, under the command
of Colonel <hi>Browne,</hi> Commander in chiefe, alſo ſix Colours of Dragooners, being in number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
foure hundred, came within a mile and a halfe of Worceſter, on the South-weſt ſide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
where we made good a paſſage at a bridge over the River Teame, and drew up our Horſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Greene, on the left hand of the River, where we abode till Friday about foure of the clock,
in expectation of ſome ſtrength, either from Glouceſter-ſhire, or elſe from my Lord Generall. Then
there came a Meſſenger with a falſe Alarum from the enemie, informing that Sir <hi>William Belfoard,</hi>
Lieutenant Generall of the Horſe, was drawne up on the further ſide of the City, and required us in
his name, that when a Canon ſhould be ſhot off, which ſhould be the ſigne of their on-ſet, then we
ſhould fall on, to make good ſome nearer paſſages, to ſtop the enemies flight, which was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but this was the enemies plot, to get us into a ſtraight way. Preſently after this, ſome Dragooners on the enemies part
appeared, in oppoſition of whom, Colonel <hi>Browne</hi> ſent out ſome from us, which begun the skirmiſh, which Colonel <hi>Sands</hi>
(who commanded all the Horſe) hearing, was then earneſt to fall on, but Captaine <hi>Nathaniel Fynes,</hi> and Captaine
<hi>Wingate</hi> deſired rather a ſtay till the Peece of Ordnance was diſcharged, but his anſwer was, that the preſent was the
Captaine <hi>Wingate</hi> prayed him not to miſtake them, their affection to the ſervice was as his, onely they deſired to proceed
adviſedly. Nevertheleſſe Colonel <hi>Sands</hi> was ſo extreame earneſt to march, that the Captaines condeſcended, onely
ſtayed to ſing a Pſalme. Before which was ended, in the laſt Diviſion, Colonel <hi>Sands</hi> marched over the paſſage, where
onely could goe foure abreaſt, till we came into the lower part of the field, in the upper whereof, the enemie was placed
in <hi>Battalia,</hi> whom we could not diſcover till we came to the top of the hill, up which Colonel <hi>Sands</hi> made ſuch haſte,
that we were forced to gallop. Then we made all poſſible ſpeed to diſpoſe of our men in order, but before the firſt five
of our Troops could be drawne up, the enemie advanced cloſe to us, and both ſides diſcharged both Carbines and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols,
and was reſolutely performed by both, and preſently fell to the ſword, and charged one through another, and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<hi>Sands</hi> broke couragiouſly (though dangerouſly) into the left wing of the enemie, being ſeconded by his Front, but
had his Cornet killed. The Colonel himſelf did fight very valiantly, was much wounded, and taken priſoner, but the reſt
of his Troop, too many of them being ſwearing, ill diſpoſed fellowes, ran away, however we ſtill maintained the field with
courage. At our firſt on-ſet we apprehended but ſome five troops of the enemies Horſe at the moſt; we conceived they had
onely the Forces that formerly kept in Worceſter, but afterwards it appeared Prince <hi>Robert</hi> and Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> were both
come to them that very day, and brought eleven Troops of Horſe, and ſome ſix or ſeven colours of Dragooners, in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſixteen hundred that they brought, beſides the Worceſter Forces. Which ſupplyes comming on ſo unexpected to
them, occaſioned us ſomewhat diſorderly to retreat to our paſſage, which notwithſtanding we were ſo much over-match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we in deſpight of them made good, and forced them to retreat three times, and killed twenty of their men dead upon
the bridge, beſides many in the field, which they have conveyed away. We have loſt ſome twenty five, and that I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
is the moſt: of them Serjeant Major <hi>Douglis</hi> was one, alſo one Captaine <hi>Berry;</hi> the reſt are well come off, and there is
ſome hope of Colonel <hi>Sands</hi> recovery, whom the enemy have left in Worceſter, from whence they are fled. Captain <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi>
on our ſide is taken priſoner, and in a moſt barbarous manner is made to ride through the townes before the enemy, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
in their flight to Ludlow. They reviled our men in the fight, calling them Parliament dogs. We took divers of their
men priſoners; And ſome of ours whom they carryed into Worceſter, and there left, have informed us, that Prince <hi>Robert</hi>
and <hi>Maurice</hi> are both wounded, and ſome of their choice Commanders ſlaine, whoſe death they bemoaned. They expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ten-fold greater advantage by their ſtratagems then God gave them; though if we had been but prepared for them, and
not under ſo many diſadvantages, we had been viſible victors. However they have no cauſe to boaſt. And one of our Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
ſayes, that Prince <hi>Robert</hi> ſwore a great oath, that the Round-heads (to give them their dues) are valiant fellows, and
came on roundly.</p>
