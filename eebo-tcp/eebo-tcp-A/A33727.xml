            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the Expression of <hi>Varius Gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> concerning <hi>Caesar,</hi> That whosoever durst speak to him, <hi>Ejus videatur ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norare, magnitudinem;</hi> he that durst not, <hi>singularem ejus nesciat humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem.</hi> Upon this Consideration, as to your self, there hath been some suspense whether I should adventure these unpoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed Meditations upon your Perusall and Protection, whilst on the one hand that exemplary humility and humanity with which God hath brightned the rest of your Perfections, hath invited me to; on the other hand, the Greatness and Elevation of your State discouraged me from that Enterprize. Yet so fixed and
<pb facs="tcp:108910:3"/>
prevailing, at the last, do the considerations of your Nobleness, Ingenuity, and Candor prove, that here they lie at your feet; if not to challenge Approbation from you, yet at least, to pay the Devotion of the Author to your Honourable Name and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
            <p>Had I sought the vain applause of men, I should not have communicated to the World my own imperfections, of which this Tract cannot but be a Discovery unto all: Nor yet, had I sought my own advantage, should I have suffered these Conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions to have had a Birth so late and unseasonable, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>born out of due time;</hi> being that a more early publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of those Principles herein contained, might have been, perhaps, as effectual to prevent the losses, disappointments, and pre-occupate the credit of whispering reproaches, which I have since undergone, as the supposal and surmise thereof, have been in former years, to procure unto me h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> small adversity from those present Powers.</p>
            <p>But of the thing it self, and the exhibition of it now to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick censure and view, these are the Grounds and Reasons.</p>
            <p>Since the preaching hereof, <hi>I</hi> have, with no little sadness of spirit, observed the impetuous torrent of most unmerciful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, pouring out it self upon many pretious servants of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ within this County, and indeed upon the whole Body of them who labour under continued travels of soul, after necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reformation in the house of our <hi>GOD.</hi> And according to the platform used by the Churches Enemies in the primitive A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Christianity, so also now the evil will of some persons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to fasten upon us, the black imputations of Disaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Disloyalty, and Dissatisfaction with his Majesties Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie according to the Law. Of what consequences such
<pb facs="tcp:108910:3"/>
Disguises by uncharitable Brethren, put upon us without our desert, may be, to the deprivation of us of our Ministerial fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the dispossessing of us from any interest in the Royal Breast of his most Excellent Majesty, and the pre-possessing of the spirit of authority with prejudice against our humble expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations and prayers for such a settlement in the Church as may comport in point of righteousness, with that establishment which now is in our State, your own apprehensions will readily suggest unto you.</p>
            <p>I must confess, I could hardly have believed that a Clergy of so famous a Fidelity to their Allegiance, as that of this County hath been, in the worst of times, ever since any observation was possible to them of a designed invasion upon Monarchical Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, that have so notoriously disavowed the Titles and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of Usurpation, and so deeply suffered upon that account, should indeed and in earnest be thus misunderstood by any sort of men; but that my self have so lately experienced the revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of that Charge and Calumny, and been prosecuted thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with so much unseasonable and unreasonable fervour, as must necessarily arise either from a real perswasion, or a most inordinate passion.</p>
            <p>Sir, It hath been and is my great honour and satisfaction, that I have some considerable acquaintance with those many Orthodox, Godly, and Learned men, whom God hath set up as glorious Lights and Stars in this Northern Hemisphere: and I am bold to say, that what is in this Paper, as to the sacred Interest of our lawful present Power, is the Language, Spirit, Principle, and conscientious Iudgement of them all, and dropt from the same Spirit that ruleth in the hearts of these precious Dispensers of the Gospel. Since these fatal Circumvolutions, many Stars of the greatest magnitude have finished their course;
<pb facs="tcp:108910:4"/>
such as <hi>Herle, Hollinworth, Gee,</hi> and others; and for the rest of us, I can say with knowledge, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks of the Christians in his time, <hi>Ad Coelum suspicientes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansis manibus precamur pro imperatoribus vitam prolixam, imperium securam, domum tutam, exercitus fortes, Senatum fidelem, populum probum, orbem qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etum, quaecunque hominis &amp; Caesaris vota sunt.</hi> And if, by misconception, subordinate Authorities shall yet please to frown upon us, we shall say with him, <hi>Hoc agite, boni praesides, extorquete animam supplicantem pro impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> Let me adde, They are not few, nor small afflictions and losses which my self, and some others, have undergone now very lately, upon the account of our objected <hi>Non-conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and our real desires to wait the Royal pleasure of his sacred Majesty in point of Publique Worship; as also our willingness not to anticipate or pre-occupate the publique resolutions of State, by our own private determination of that controversie in our particular practise. We are under good hopes that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of those things (which in their present posture may so easily be made the advantage of serving the particular spleens and passions of men, against many godly, and orthodox, and peaceable in the land) will produce such a Reformation and Moderation as will issue in mutual satisfaction to all of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perswasions.</p>
            <p>For my own part, although I do profess my self zealously affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to a common Uniformity, provided it be bottom'd upon such foundations as do not carry in them just cause of dissent or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content: Yet <hi>I</hi> cannot but remember what <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks, When men do <hi>adimere libertatem Religionis, &amp; interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere optionem Divinitatis;</hi> which he there calls <hi>Elogium</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:108910:4"/>
               <hi>non Religionis sed Irreligiositatis.</hi> I know nothing, in our Ecclesiastical Affairs, but may with comfort and consent draw in the whole Body into a common Mediocrity, if the sober ventilation of controverted things might have place, and the passion, prejudice and opportunities of divided Interests might be exploded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> You may be a blessed Instrument for this happy compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. But hower it shall be, after all such passages, <hi>I</hi> publish this, that all men may see, That it was not the confidence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with our Principles, that was the foundation of our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting of the Royal Interest; that we bottom not our Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon the comporting of Authority with our Iudgements; that subjection is owned to be our duty, although we should fall under the most diametral opposition of Civil Laws and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to our Principles in the things of God; that we will give submission to lawful Powers, though we should suffer the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est affliction by lawful Powers, which yet we hope we shall never see. Subjection to Authority, and subjection to Iesus Christ, are not things of inconsistencie, but where Christian profession is made up more of the dross of self-interest, then of the refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Gold of the Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> I humbly beg your Honours Pardon for this accompt; You are one of the Healers of our Breaches. You are able to take off the Disguise is put upon us, by your own knowledge of our Fidelity, when the work of the Lord had little else to support it but prayers and tears; You may stand as a Mediator in the behalf of the Church, for Peace, and Reformation, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. That God that honours them that honour him, fill your heart more and more with his blessed Grace &amp; Spirit, Your Soul with Peace, Your Family with Prosperity, Your Life with Comfort, and Your Death with Blessedness; Your Memorial
<pb facs="tcp:108910:5"/>

Till <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi>'s time, the children of <hi>Israel</hi> were ruled by Judges, and had no King over them. At that time the Government was mixed of Monarchy and Aristocracie; the Principality was elective by the People and their Parliament, I mean by the Grand Sanhedrim, the Assembly of Seventy El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which may be understood in the Text by the word <hi>Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,</hi>

For though the Scepter was departed from <hi>Iudah,</hi> yet he had a Law-give<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> (though a Magistracy of a baser metal) betwixt his feet till <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh</hi> came. I conceive this cannot be the sense of the Text; and my reason is, Because, 1. there is no necessity to interpret the words Judges and Counsellors, as importing such a form. The fullest power of Monarchical Government being often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by this word, Psal. 75. 7. <hi>God is the judge:</hi> and when <hi>Absalom</hi> desires to be King in the room of his Father, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 4. he speaks thus, <hi>Oh! that I were judge:</hi> to omit other places, the word <hi>Counsellors</hi> also may well be applied to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority and Legislative power; it being common in Scripture for those commands of God which have the highest Authority to enforce them, and his own decrees, to be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by this word, as may be seen in <hi>Isa.</hi> 14. 27. <hi>Isa.</hi> 23. 9. and Counsellors may be as this Sanhedrim afterwards was <hi>assistant</hi> to Monarchy, besides others particularly chosen to it, as 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 27. 33. 2. And this sense would too much intrench upon that which was the Authority settled by God in the Family of <hi>David,</hi> and promised to continue in <hi>Iudahs</hi> posterity until <hi>Shiloh</hi> come. 3. Nor was there ever any restoring thereof after the captivity in the <hi>exactness</hi> of that form by which it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinguished from regal power formerly; as might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced in divers particulars. 2. Further then, the words may import Government in its <hi>full administration and execution.</hi> You shall not only have Authority Supreme, but you shall have it fully executed. When <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> provided for the good of his people, he set up Judges in all the Cities, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 8. and these were persons who for the ease and conveniency of the Kingdom, were to be ready to see to the dispensation of right at the appointment of the Soveraign Power. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108910:9"/>
               <hi>Peter</hi> makes a distinction betwixt those <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authorities, and such as are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates sent and deputed by him: And thus Counsellors may be understood as I mention'd before, either of the standing Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the seventy Elders, or such persons as Princes chose, out of a design to bottom their Laws and Government upon the deepest reason, most mature deliberation and sound advice. Thus then the promise should be; that as thou shalt have Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy restored, so thy Princes shall act by advice, and the Law shall have its full administration in the hands of his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and subordinate Judges. But this is not full to the purpose of this Prophecie; for the breach of Israel was not the losse of these, but the losse of the <hi>Supreme Authority;</hi> the Kingdom was <hi>made base,</hi> and they had no strong rod to be a Scepter to bear Rule: this was their lamentation, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>Therefore lastly, 2. The words do import the restitution of Government and Magistracy it self; not to lay any stress upon any particular form; for though it is true that after the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish captivity the Tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> and family of <hi>David</hi> recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the fullness of Monarchical power and splendor, yet then the people had their <hi>legal,</hi> although not their <hi>regal</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy. This saith God, I will restore, a lawful, righteous, fixed, settled Authority; I will set you free from the Babylonish usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of the Heathen, wherein you were vassels to a strange King, and servants to a people of a strange god. What the state of the people of the Jews was during the seventy years captivity, as to this total abolition of their rightful Princes, I need not open. But now, saith God, I will <hi>restore.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed such is the misery of Anarchy, confusion, and want of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that any form is better then none at all; and a <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> though in an unproper hand, is better then the <hi>Sword,</hi> Wars, and desolations: I say, Better then none; which may well apolog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ze for the submission to (though dissatisfaction with) u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped powers which hath been yeilded by good men in the time of the violent dispossession and disseisure of our rightful sacred Principality. But, saith the Lord, I will restore Authority; the <hi>rightfulness and legality</hi> thereof is more properly couched under the particle, <hi>thy,</hi> thy Judges, and thy Counsellors; and this is the next.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:108910:9"/>2. A second Branch of the promise, <hi>I will restore thy] Iudges, and thy</hi>] Counsellor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: this is no small part, though it be not the main and principal priviledge of the promise. Take up the importance of it in these particulars. First, I will restore thee such Princes as are <hi>thine, as being of thy own people;</hi> The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture speaks of it as a judgment upon a people from God, to be vassaliz'd to the power of foraign Princes of a <hi>strange language, and of a strange god.</hi> The command of God in the Law of the Kingdom was, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 15. that the King should be one from amongst their brethren; they might in no wise set a stranger over them, which was not their brother: and 'tis promised as a blessing, <hi>Ier.</hi> 30. 21. their Nobles shall be of <hi>themselves,</hi> and their Governour shall proceed from the <hi>midst of them;</hi> which though applicable to Christ, yet is by others understood of the restoring of Government after the captivity. This is a further discovery of this promised mercy, Thou shalt lie under the power and be judged by the Laws of the Babylonish Monarchs no more, but then I will restore the Princes that are and ought to be of thy own Religion, Nation, Language, People. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I will restore thee Princes such are thine, as <hi>being chosen, accepted, embraced, approved, rightfully established over thee,</hi> and <hi>sworn allegiance unto by thee; thy rightful, lawful powers, such whose authority is thy birthright, comfort, satisfaction.</hi> The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and prevailing of persons over a people may produce a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: but it is not properly [<hi>theirs</hi>] unless it be that, and in the hands of such persons with which and with whom both Right and Law, Justice and the indispensable free Obligations and Oaths of people are fully satisfied. What a people may do if free, and as the Apostle speaks of a woman loosed from the Law of her husband, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. by his death (which properly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said of the Supreme Magistracy, however under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent force) is another case; but in the interim the intrusion of the greatest persons into that sacred bed, is but the ravishment of the people; and of such it may be said, as in that of Christ to the woman, <hi>This which thou hast is not thy] husband.</hi> How much the most powerful and fixed sword of usurpation, may under all the terrours it keepeth a people under, yet lie under the secret disownings, nauseatings and disgusts thereof by them, I need

And yet I do not think that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and title of Kings is dependent on the approbation, Oathes and Covenants of their people, the title of authority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as <hi>it was with Israel, as it is with us.</hi> God hath not left a people liberty to carve out the model of their own authority, and take it up, or cast it off as their own reason or passion shall dictate to them. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> speaks, meddle not with them; the duty of Allegiance to Supreme powers is not that which hangs upon the unfixed and wavering principles of humane choice: for so there should be as many sorts of Kings, as Israel had of gods, and as many sorts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as distemper'd brains could fancie to themselves. The title of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was not the better for the unanimous consent of the ten Tribes in that revolt. You inherit as much reason to preserve your <hi>Princes,</hi> as you do by descent to possess your <hi>Patrimonies.</hi> And therefore, thirdly, I will restore thee Princes such as <hi>are thine by designation from God;</hi> whether accepted or not accepted by thee, yet if they come with a mission and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from God in the active and approbative influx of his will, this is a mercy for thee; not he whom the people shall chuse (for the people chose <hi>Absalom,</hi> and outed <hi>David;</hi> chose <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> and rejected the son of <hi>Solomon</hi>) but he whom God shall chuse. And lastly, I will restore thee Princes that shall be thine, as being such as <hi>seek not thine but thee,</hi> such as do possess that honour, splendor, power and greatness not for themselves but for thee: such as seek thy good and not their own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, thy profit and not their own praise. And surely this is a blessing to purpose; and then indeed thy Princes may be called thine, when their Magistratical interest is wholly for peoples benefit and advantage.</p>
            <p>3. The last Branch of the mercy, I will restore thy Judges <hi>as at the first,</hi> and thy Magistracy <hi>as at the beginning.</hi> This is the upshot of all. The Question is, to what time the Prophet relates in those expressions, <hi>at the first,</hi> and <hi>at the beginning.</hi> It
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108910:10"/>
may refer either to that time when Israel began to be a distinct people from the rest of the Nations, and grown up to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable body, having overgrown the notion of a Family, or a Colony only; and that was when God fetched them out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and set them under the Government of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi> after him; or when Israel began to be a distinct Kingdom, in the time of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> It is not much material which of these ways you understand it: because I conceive the design of the words herein is not so much to point out some exact platform of the kind and sort of Magistracy, as it is to hold forth, 1. The <hi>Qualification</hi> of the persons that God doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise shall weild the Scepter of Authority: they shall be such as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> 2. The <hi>right</hi> of such persons to possess the Crown; having a respect to that captivity in which the people for seventy years shoul lie under the Tyranny of usurped powers. And so the whole of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is, When I have by afflicting thee purged away the dross of thy sin, then I will restore the settlement of Authority in its rightful hands, to whom by the institution and appointment of God it appertains; and thy Princes shall be such as was <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and my servant <hi>David.</hi> And then this promise had its full accomplishment in the Government of <hi>Ezra, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua, Zerubbabel,</hi> and others, though not in that fullnesse of outward pomp and glory as before. And so much for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the Text.</p>

            <p>It is a choice and singular mercy to any Kingdom, Nation or<note place="margin">Observ. 1.</note> People, when (especially after a breach made upon it) God doth restore to them such a Government and Authority as was that of <hi>Moses, Ioshua, David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> to his people Israel.</p>
            <p>The work of this day is to triumph in the Lord and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon this very reason; God his restoring our Judges as at the first, and our Counsellors as at the beginning. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall but cast in these Considerations as to the truth of this Observation, each of which carries light enough to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Point, but all together do shine with such beams of demonstration, as may not only convince the judgment, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven sets the heart in flames of affection, transported with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joy; when blessed by God with such a deliverance, and at such a time. Consider therefore,</p>
            <p>1. If God do restore to a people such a Government as was that of <hi>Moses, Ioshua, David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> then they have [<hi>a Government</hi>] and Authority settled over them. They do not lie common each to other, to become the Arbitrary preys of power and violence. I know this Consideration comes not fully up to what may be expected to be spoken; yet it's a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of no small concernment for a people to have a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fixed over them. What the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108910:11"/>
Gospel, however in the Ministry of evil principled or unduly officed men, Phil. 1. 18. <hi>However Christ is preached;</hi> the same I may translate to this case: however the undue administration or fixation of Civil Powers may sadden the hearts of the people of God, yet in that condition it is some allay, that <hi>however Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy is kept up,</hi> and the reins are not left in the neck of the unruly multitude. When the Author of the Book of <hi>Iudges</hi> (whom some would suppose to be <hi>Samuel,</hi> other <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and other <hi>Ezra,</hi> &amp;c.) would set forth the sad estate of Israel, the<note place="margin">Vide Sixt. Senens.</note> expression is considerable, <hi>Iudg</hi> 21. 25. <hi>In those days there was no King in Israel.</hi> I do not suppose that text or the other in that Book, where the same thing is expressed, to point at the want of a <hi>regal form of Magistracy,</hi> (for neither in those days nor in any former days till after, had there been any such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution with that people) but to signifie those intervals and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terregna</hi> that fell out betwixt the times of their Judges, when there was no Magistracy at all. And in those days, when there was no King, there was no peace, there was no justice, there was no religion in a sort, but every man did what was right in his own eyes. Consul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> but a little the cases therein expressed, to which your Marginal Notes and Quotations upon that Text have reference. Judg. 17. 5. <hi>In those days there was no King in Israel:</hi> and what then? the man <hi>Micah</hi> had an house of gods, and made an Ephod, and consecrated one of his sons to be his Priest; people set up their worship as pleased the liberty of a perverted judgment and erronious Conscience. Judg. 18. 1. <hi>There was no King in Israel;</hi> and what then? the Danites take the boldness to make rapes upon their Brethren, and to cut out an inheritance by the length of their swords. Judg. 19. 1. <hi>There was no King in Israel;</hi> and what followed? the men of <hi>Gibeah</hi> do force the Levites Concubine, and most shamefully abuse her even unto death, and justifie the action, with the concurrence of all the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> in the defence of that horrid wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness. These are fruits, but not the tenth part of the fruits of Anarchy and confusion; when God threatens the pouring out of his wrath upon Israel, he tells them in <hi>Hos.</hi> 3. 4. they shall abide many days without a King, and without a Priest, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Ephod; which some apply to the time of the captivity,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:108910:12"/>
others to the days of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and some to this present state of that people since the time of Christ. It is indeed observed by <hi>Tertullian</hi> as the misery of that people, <hi>Dispersi palabundi, coeli &amp; soli qui exterres vagantur per orbem, sine homine sine Deo rege,</hi> without either God or man to be their King. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Rabbi <hi>Benjamin</hi> in his Itinerary lately have attempted to publish their places of abode and formes of Government; yet the world knows, that the Scepter is departed from that people, and that they live under the powers and pleasures of others, subjected to the Laws to which their wandring estate upon the earth doth bring them in several States, Principalities and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. <hi>Seneca</hi> calls Government the very vital spirits of a Commonwealth, <hi>ipsa nihil per se futura nisi onus &amp; praeda, si mens imperii subtrahatur;</hi> she her self would be nothing else but a burden to her self, and a prey to others, if once she had expired the soul of Government. And therefore the restitution here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is a choice and singular mercy to any Kingdom. But more,</p>
            <p>2. If God do restore a Kingdom to such a Government as that of <hi>Moses, Ioshua, David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> then they are restored to a <hi>legal, rightful and just Government</hi> and Authority. Those persons were just and lawful Princes, such as came to the Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter by a warrant from God. I need not stand upon the proof of that; They were not such as mounted the Throne by wickedness and force, nor compassed the Crown by falshood or flattery; they did not pawn their Consciences, and stain their reputation, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks of some in his time, <hi>propter u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108910:12"/>
soul for God and the vindication of his people, then it was pen'd with laboriousnesse, judgment and depth of solid reason. But that which I shall set before you, is the unvaluable blessings of a Magistracy <hi>sent, approved, and warranted, and justified by God himself.</hi> To clear up this, let me set before you but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of what I might say as to the evil of usurpation upon Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>First, Usurpers in Magistracy usually fall most foul upon God and the interest of Religion, either imposing and enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing corrupt and wicked innovations upon the people, or else supporting a wretched toleration of a boundlesse liberty. See for this the practice of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> (for I speak of such Kingdoms and Principalities as have the knowledge and worship of the true God, or Jesus Christ whom he hath sent.) No sooner was he setled in that Throne which of right belonged to the Son of <hi>Solomon,</hi> but the whole course of sacred worship is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and golden Calves set up at <hi>Bethel</hi> in stead of God; and this thing became a sin to Israel that was inexpiable. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed usurpation contracts upon its self a sort of necessity of this wickednesse. It is one of the Rules and Principles of <hi>Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mach. disput. cap. 26.</note> about persons that invade the regal power, <hi>In id unice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendat oportet ut sicut ipse novus princeps est, it a in suo principatu innovet omnia;</hi> that they be sure of this, to bring an innovation of all things else, together with the mutation and change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. What such powers and persons do observe, may tend to gratifie and please the people, or at least the most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, stirring and tumultuous part of it (for such usually is that part which is the most corruptly principled) or may lay the greatest foundations for their own possession of their unjust Authority; this is that Pole-Star by which Usurpation steers its course. And therefore wo unto thee, thou sacred and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed interest of truth and true Religion, when such disseisures are made of lawful Powers, who need not the assistance of such cursed contrivances, Machiavilian plots, and debauched Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences to support them. And no marvel if usurpation be at least the fountain of a boundless toleration, since erronious spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, though the most hateful enemies to a just Authority, yet are the fastest friends and fittest Instruments for arbitrary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108910:13"/>
as being principled to own or approve any Authority only as it is fitted to countenance and support their way; being not of that antient Christian spirit (of which <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks) of fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to Princes never so opposite to Christianity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Usurpation in Magistracy brings a snare upon the People as to their obedience and subjection. Alas! what wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful troubles, what scruples to Conscience, what wracking and tentering of invention and understanding, to finde out nice and subtle distinctions and evasions, doth this produce? for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the imposition and command of sinful and unlawful things be possible to the most approved and sacred powers, yet it is generally an inseparable adjunct of any ones violent intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion into Supremacy, as might be proved at large both in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and sacred story, and might be demonstrated from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry interest of usurpation. Upon this ground, how many both Priests and People were forced either to quit their Conscience, or to quit their house and home and all they had, you may read in the case of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 16. And upon this ground, in the imposition of Engagements, Oaths, Fasts and Thanksgivings, some in this Congregation what they have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered know abundantly. But besides all this, there lies no small difficulty upon the People of God, as to obedience of unlawful Powers in <hi>even lawful things:</hi> what conflicts of the soul betwixt the goodness and necessity of the action, on the one hand, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and perswading to the acting of it; and betwixt the illegality of the Power that commands it, on the other hand, and the unwillingness of any sober spirit to do even good it self to the strengthening of the hands and claim of violence! for my part, I shall wish we may rather never have occasion to be put to experience and try, then any more to be exercised under such temptations. But such is the fate and state of usurped Powers as to the case of people.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Usurpation in Magistracy deprives a people of the liberty and opportunity of discharging their real, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed duty to their lawful Prince and Soveraign. Surely Christians, this is no small affliction. Princes and legal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers when under bondage, banishment or other separation from their people, may look with a troubled eye upon them; but alas,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108910:13"/>
the people themselves do feel no less affliction and smart in that divorce then they. It is as irksome to a Christian people to be forced from their lawful Powers, as it is for them to be forced from their people. I know no interest that hath deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er impression upon the Conscience and Spirit of the People of God, under and below their devotion to God himself, and the happiness of their precious souls, then their reverence and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, affection and fidelity to the majesty of their Prince. And however the misunderstandings or other fatal providences betwixt them and their lawful Princes, may sometimes by the righteous judgment of God, as it hath lately been with us, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the distance of each from other; yet when the honest and rational ends of men have been abused to the injury and wrong of the Supreme Authority, it is not unobserved by every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon understanding, how much those rapes and violences have sat upon the spirits of the godly in this Land, to their deep af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and grief, and the producing of those fervent, frequent Fasts and Prayers which have been answer'd from heaven, as we now see. Whilest a People therefore have so much of grace, godliness and fidelity left as not to prostitute themselves to the lust of usurpation, and not to take a present suspension of their political husbands power and presence for a dissolution of their matrimonial bond, and liberty to admit Invaders into that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin undefiled Bed (which is a more gross Adultery then that of a Wife from her Husband, unless endured by force and ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) I say, whilst this is so, what can we imagine of such a People, in such dismal violent separations, but that they sit so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary as a Widow that hath none to comfort her? When it shall be Treason, Death, Destruction, what not? so much as to Preach or Pray for their natural Lords, nay, to mention their very Names with any mark of honour, respect or reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Usurpation in Magistracy commonly proves the extirpation of the Ministry, in Christian States and Kingdoms, amongst a People that worship the true God. This is visible enough under the Tyranny of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 14. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Levites either left their possessions or lost their integrity, and flock'd in such numbers to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> from all their Cities.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108910:14"/>
I know it is possible for the Ministers of Christ to lie under deep affliction, even under lawful Powers; and although we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and laborious to promote the resettlement of his sacred Majesty, a thing of so indisputable an obligation upon us all, yet we are not without the pre-conception and foresight of the evil use which evil men may make of this deliverance, to vassal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize and persecute the dearest of the Truths, Ordinances and Interests, and Ministers of Jesus Christ. Yet in usurped Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers there lies a kind of fatal necessity of persecution against such. For besides that obligation which lies upon usurped Powers to serve the satisfactions of such a Clergy as have been the Stirr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p to help them to mount the Saddle of Authority; the very truth of God, which is and ought to be in the mouth of his faithful Prophets, that (be sure) never speaks good of or to either wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or usurping Princes, is a continual torture and vexation to their spirits, a continual dissettlement and disquiet to their Power. I know the intermeddling of us with matters of State hath been mightily cried against, as a thing out of the Commission of the Ministers of the Gospel; as if we were not as well to Preach against the sins of great as small, of Powers as of the People under them. When <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had set up his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, the Prophet (and he was sent of God) cried out to his face against his Idols and Idolatry, Oh Altar, Altar, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. Although it was <hi>the grief</hi> of <hi>Ahab,</hi> yet it was <hi>the grace</hi> of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> in a right sense, that he was the man that troubled Israel, that set his face and sharpned his Ministry against the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of that Idolatrous Usurper. When the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> speaks the truth of God against the house of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> the Land cannot bear his words; and if he will Prophecie any more, he must flee to the Land of <hi>Iudah,</hi> where his lawful and natural Prince was, but no more in <hi>Bethel,</hi> for it was the Chappel, House and Kingdom of the Usurper, <hi>Amos</hi> 7. 10, 12. The truth is, if the Ministers of the Gospel do as they ought to do, publish free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the mind of God against the horrid encroachments are made upon Magistracy by force and violence, or if they have not a freedom to take all such Engagements, Oaths and Promises as are imposed upon them to the renouncing of the just Authority of their legal Princes, the very interest of usurpation is bound
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108910:14"/>
up and concerned in the extirpation of such; and of this <hi>my self and many others have had too sad and ample experience.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly never did Nation know more fearful vexations, more scornful contempts, more treasonable charges against, more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid abuses, more universal dislocations of the most godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and more Magisterial Lordings over them in the work of their callings, then we have done, since the fatal blow was given in 164<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to our sacred and Supreme Authority. I know these are unwelcome and unpleasing things to insist upon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall trouble you with no more then this: Lastly, Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>shall not prosper;</hi> Kingdoms and Principalities bottom'd upon bloud, rapine and injustice shall shortly expire themselves, and have the hand of vengeance against them, be they never so strong, potent and magnificent. It was not long before eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that pissed against the wall was cut off from the race of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 10. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 29. <hi>Baasha</hi> left not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his house that breathed; Nor had <hi>Baasha's</hi> posterity any long possession of the Crown, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16. 10. for <hi>Zimri</hi> a Captain of his Army smote and slew him. And had <hi>Zimri</hi> peace who slew his Master? 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 31. or had the Family of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi> any durable possession of that Crown which they unjustly as to themselves, although justly as to God took off from the head of <hi>Ahab?</hi> No, Usurpers have ever this fate attending their Principality, that by their own justification of force upon their lawful Soveraigns, they have left that example of liberty to men, that in no long time proves the cut-throat and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their own Authority; and that principle and power which dispossessed the rightful, proves as effectual to dispossess the wrongful and invading Magistracy. How fully hath this been evidenced in our times, and days, may be fully seen by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices and declarations of some persons whom I forbear. You may say, The non-prospering of usurpation is good: Better so by much, then to have it fix and settle. True, and so say I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, as I marked before. Such fleeting of the Scepter when placed illegally, is the most hopeful way of its fixation in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural basis; And therefore I would advise discomposed States to keep on foot such a variation of Authority as to forme, or persons, as the best way of issuing the dissettlement in a retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation

            <p>3. If God do restore to a people such a Government as that of <hi>Moses, Ioshua, David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> then they have Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment vested in the hands of them who are good and holy, and such as the Lord delighteth in. Such Persons, and Princes of such blessed tempers, may well be (as was said of <hi>Titus) De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciae humani generis,</hi> The Darlings and Delights of all the People. I shall not largely run over the Story of those Authorities; but shall set before you some remarkable things of them. 1. They were such as ruled in righteousness. <hi>David</hi> would not have the floor of <hi>Araunah,</hi> No, not to build an Altar on to the Lord. unless he might pay him the value of it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 24. Of the children of Israel did <hi>Solomon</hi> make no bondmen, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 9. 22. but preserved them in the possession of those rights which God had given them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 39. and such was the administration of his power, that the whole earth sought unto him to hear his wisdom, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 24. To enumerate the particular acts of righteousness in these Princes, would be too long, the sacred story affords you abundant satisfaction.

They were such as preferred the peoples good above their own, their Subjects were more dear unto them then their Scepter, their Kingdom then their Crown. When <hi>Ioshua</hi> divided the Land for the inheritance of the people, it is remarkable he kept not a foot of it for himself, nor had he any but what the children of Israel gave him, <hi>Ioshua</hi> 19. 49.

of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 17. <hi>Let thy hand be against me and against the house of my fathers; but as for these sheep, what have they done?</hi> and <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 32. 32. who would rather wish to be blotted out of the book of God, then that his wrath should break out against the people.

Nolite curare in regno vestro à quo tueatur vel op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnetur ecclesia domini vestri? quis velit esse religiosus vel sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legus?</hi> This is the glory and excellency of Princes, that as they are Gods, and Gods Vicegerents upon earth; so nothing should be more sacred to them then the interest of truth, and power of godliness; and what mercy greater can befal a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then such a Magistracy? For if the <hi>delirium regis,</hi> the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of the Prince do cause such punishments on the whole body; if the excellency and glory of any Government lie in the serviceableness thereof to promote and honour truth and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to discountenance and discourage errour and prophaness; if (as generally it is) an holy Prince makes an happy people: how great then is this mercy, when God shall restore thee such Judges as at the first, and such Counsellors as at the beginning? But to conclude, 5. They were such, as what they were, the same they continued to be till the end of their race, till death it self made their sacred heads to stoop to its impartial stroke. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the latter days of <hi>Solomon,</hi> there arose some cloud upon the splendor of his former Government, occasion'd by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his Idolatrous Wives upon him, so hazardous a thing it is for Kings to marry the Daughters of a strange god; but yet
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108910:16"/>
he recovered himself from that declination, and rose up to as great an altitude of holiness and zeal for God as ever formerly, when his own experience had enabled him to pen the Book of <hi>Ecclesiastes. Moses,</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> their care of their people lived till they died; and what they were at first, they were till the very last in their personal graces and profitable Government. It is usual for Kings to begin their Dominion with more acceptance then to continue it; <hi>Mitissima sors est</hi>

Such Princes were these, who were the older, better; the longer they lived, the more deeply did they love their people, and the more dearly were they loved by them, and went to their graves with common lamentation.</p>
            <p>4. I might add, if God do restore to a people such a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then their Government is vested in the hands of such as have parts and abilities from God for the fitting of them to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their Authority. God had put of the spirit of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and the whole earth came to hear the Wisdom of <hi>Solomon.</hi> He himself that had had the experience of what was necessary for the Ruler of such a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, cries out, Eccles. 10. 16. <hi>Wo unto thee, O land, when thy</hi>

But I shall conclude this with this Observation: As the giving to a people of such a Government is a blessing, so the <hi>restoring of</hi> it is much more; for so the Text speaks, I will restore, or I will cause to return, as the word imports, thy Judges as at the first, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have touched at some inconveniences of the force that may fall out upon legal, gracious, rightful Authorities; And what woful effects do attend such violences and usurpations; and therefore shall add no more. But in such a day as this, when God doth not only <hi>give, but restore,</hi> and cause to return, a separated Husband to the bosom of his disconsolate Wife, a banished Father to the arms of his long-lamenting Children: but, I say, in such a day, and such a day is this, Oh! how ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging is that Deliverance; how full and fat, and fruitful a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is this? I will restore thy Judges as at the first, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so much shall serve for that Observation.</p>
            <p>The excellency and the choicest chiefest blessing of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<note place="margin">Observ. 2.</note> is, when it hath an influence upon such persons as live under it, to make them eminent for righteousness and holiness.</p>
            <p>This is that which the Text sets down, as the chiefest Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Imperial Diadem, the Crown and Glory of Princes, and that which procureth the greatest good and benefit of the people. <hi>Afterwards thou shalt be called, The City of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the faithful City.</hi> I shall hasten to a conclusion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall set before you onely these three Demonstrations of this Principle. I know upon what foundations the most of men do build up their joys, in the restitution of Authority; some upon the outward pomp and grandeur of such Kingdoms, some upon the hopes of raising themselves and their Estates and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes by them, some upon the perswasion of the harmony is betwixt their Princes and them in matters of judgment, and the advantage thereby to promote <hi>and impose</hi> their principles about Religion and the things of God; too many whose triumphing is bottom'd not so much upon the righteous establishment of the Throne, as upon their own bewitching dreams and pleasant fancies of revenge, and of opportunities thereby to pour out their wrath upon the people of their hatred (such injury dare
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108910:17"/>
wickedness do to sacred Powers, as thus to imagine it to furnish their lusts with strength and opportunity; such an horrid asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion dare men, some unhappy men, cast upon the glorious Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Majesty.) And they are not few who this day are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore blessing God because the Iron-rod of Usurpation is shiver'd to pieces, and the Scepter is restored to its rightful Tribe; <hi>whatever shall be the issue,</hi> Yet thus it should be, thus the Lord would have it be. Yet Christians, let me add that this, this is that topmost branch of the glory of Princes, when they are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental to make their people a City that is eminent for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, truth and holiness. That I may shut up your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings under the conviction of this truth, take but these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations of it.</p>
            <p>1. That is the Glory and Crown of Magistracy, which in the attainment of it, is the principal end of its institution by God. The suitableness of things to the cause and reason of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and when they are effectual to the production of the work, for which and for nothing else they were created, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed or raised up by God, this is the glory, this the beauty of them. The institution of the Ministry of the Gospel, is in order to the begetting of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. is for the perfecting of the Saints, and the building up of Christs body, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. and therefore the Apostle concludes that the influence of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stleship upon the Thessalonians suitable to this reason for which he was sent by God, this was his glory and his crown of joy, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 20. True it is that the choicest Instruments are not always bless'd with the real production of that which is the end of their ordination and appointment; the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, that he had laboured in vain, and spent his strength for nought: but where there is a disposition, frame and spirit in such persons suitable to the end of their institution, a labouring and wrastling for the effecting thereof, so that the frustration ariseth not from the carelesness, unsuitableness, indisposition of the persons imployed in such an office, but from the wilfulness, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexibleness, hardness of the object, there and in such a case, though Israel be not gather'd, yet such persons in the eyes of God are glorious, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 5. As thus it is in the case of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical, so also in that of Civil Powers and Ordinances. While
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:108910:18"/>
men are so taken up in the consideration of Magistracy, I would wish them to ponder, for what end and reason it was that ever such an Ordinance or thing was appointed by God. And let me freely speak it, this in the Text was the end thereof, That the societies of men might have truth and justice, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness and holiness running down as a mighty stream in the midst of them. When God raised up <hi>Moses,</hi> what was his work but this? <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 12. Carry my people, this people of the Lord in thy bosom, as the Father doth the sucking-child.

It is a most cursed reflection upon the honour of our Soveraign, that the practice of so many men takes now the liberty to break out in such a violent stream and torrent of prophaness, that men begin to be daring and bold in their Oaths, and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, their May-Pole horrid and Heathenish Idolatries, their prophanation of Sabbaths and contempt of Ordinances; that Popery and the grandest Factors for that interest do lift up their heads with so much imperiousness, as if the restoring of our Government to its proper Chanel would be the justification or allowance of these or any of these impieties. Alas, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Curse not the King, no not in your thoughts; do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend things so injurious and reflecting upon his sacred Crown and Dignity. The end of his Royal Power is the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing, suppressing, restraining of all such Cursers, Swearers, Drunkards, Sabbath-breakes, the lifting up of the happiness and peace of the holy and righteous, and peaceable in the Land, whom you despise, scorn, reproach and trample under your feet. And therefore the Lord forgive those of you that talk most of your affection to his sacred Majesty, and yet do thus conceive
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:108910:18"/>
and represent him by your practise, to the blackest staining of that Princely honour and esteem, which should be sacred amongst all people. To propagate, preserve and prosper righteousness truth and holiness in their Dominions, this is the end of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy, this is the beauty, the most orient perfection in the Imperial Diadem: and upon this foundation it is that the glory of <hi>Constantine, Iustinian,</hi> and other Christian Princes hath been raised up to such a lasting fabrick, as stands still to this day unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced in their sacred Monuments. When <hi>Iob</hi> a person and Prince of great Authority gives an account of the right admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of his power, <hi>Iob</hi> 29. he tells us, he <hi>delivered the poor that cryed, the fatherless and him that had no helper; the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon him, and he caused the widows heart to sing for joy; he was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame; he brake th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:108910:19"/>
however it hence is manifest that the glory of their motion in that Orb of Supremacy in which they are fixed by God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon their beneficial communications to the real welfare and happiness of those that are concerned in the fatal effects of their Conjunctions, Aspects or Eclipses. Let me add then, that your greatest benefit you can reap by any Authority over you, is this in the Text, when by the influence of that Power you become a City of righteousness, holiness and truth, having thereby the free distribution of justice amongst all, and the full establishment of Truth in Doctrine, Purity in Worship, and an encouraged justified holiness in all that profess the name of God. Alas! the good that you should have by Magistracy, doth not lie in the enjoyment of liberty to serve your lusts, and the profane principles of a graceless spirit, to set up the Idols and Errours of your own hearts, and to enforce your will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or superstition upon the Consciences of others; but it lies in the enforcing of <hi>duty, holiness, righteousness and reformation,</hi> and the perpetual discouragement of whatsoever intrencheth upon the interest and propagation of grace and truth, as it is in Jesus Christ. He doth you most good, that makes you most good; most Holy, Orthodox, Sincere, living up to the fulness of your light; and putting a soul into your Worship and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession by the Spirit and Power of Godliness. I am not unsensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon what foundations many thousands of persons do bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom their joy in the deliverance of this day.

Oh! <hi>what if we shall have a King, and yet fear not the Lord?</hi> what then should a King do to us? what if we shall have no more Wars with men, and yet still have the most fatal Wars with God? what if we shall lie under less of suffering, and yet live under more of sin? what if we shall have better Laws, but worser Lives? what if our Liberties. and Estates, and we shall meet again, and yet Christ and our souls shall part for ever and never meet more? what if we shall have plenty, but no piety? a lawful, merciful, gracious King to Rule the outward

man, but a bloud-thirsty implacable Tyrant the Devil to hurry the souls of men to destruction? Oh! Christians think of it. There are too many who scandalize our Government, and cast dirt upon the royal Scepter, in promising to themselves, I know not what, licentiousness without a Curb, revenge without a Law, destruction of others without distinction, Popery with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a penalty, and what they please to impose upon the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Worshippers of Jesus Christ without a Scripture. Should it be so (which God forbid the thoughts of should enter into my heart) yet were this a good for thee? and that good which God hath raised up his Anointed ones to accomplish for thee? Oh! let it not enter into your thoughts, lest the very Birds of the Air do tell the matter. Thus poyson were better for the body then suitable nourishment, and liberty safer then restraint to him who through phrenzies or other strong distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hunts after nothing more then opportunity to destroy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. I know indeed there are many blessed fruits which these Kingdoms may joyfully, and warrantably, and with much confidence expect to be the product of this blessed restitution of his sacred Majesty. Such as are the vindication of this Church and Kingdoms honour, the wiping off the aspersion, and rouling away the reproach of disloyalty from too many up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom it is too familiary but most unjustly cast, the settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our peace, and the prosperous future state of all: but let me say of this, If God shall (as we hope and pray he will) by the influence of the Kings Authority sentence the reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of his ways and people into everlasting silence, muzzle the mouth of blasphemous swearers, rout the societies of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable drunkards into corners that they dare not see the Sun, clear the streets, and empty the houses from the provoking crew of Sabbath-breakers, and set up with encouragement the Worship of the Gospel, the practise of holiness in all orders of men, <hi>pray let me say</hi> of this, as <hi>David of Goliahs</hi> sword, <hi>There is none like that;</hi> other things do well, but this excels them all. For however distastful these things may be, and cross to the grain of many, too many with us, yet this would be the greatest mercy to your souls, your eternal precious souls, ten thousand to one to be shipwrack'd and lost if left to the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108910:20"/>
liberty of your own hearts; and this would be the greatest mercy even to your outward estate. For what hopes of any blessing from above, where settlement and prosperity is abused? where that deliverance which should be the grave, is made but the womb and birth of that wickedness, Idolatry and unrefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medness, that doth and will keep up the controversie with God without composure. Hence it hath so often come to pass, that people who have not become holy by being made externally happy in such eminent ways of deliverance as this, have so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten seen the speedy eclipse of the brightest Sun of their own prosperity. Certainly if the toleration of Prophaness and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie and Idolatry in the Church, be <hi>crudelis misericordia,</hi> a thing that carries in it more of cruelty then of charity to the souls of men; and if the drawing of the sword of Ecclesiastical power in the hands of the Ministers of the Gospel against the growing corruptions of their Flock, be an act of the greatest mercy, as appears 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. the same will hold in its proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Civil Powers; of whom let me shut up this, and say, They are then the farthest off from doing unjusty, when they make us the furthest off from doing wickedly; they have then been truly Fathers of their Country, when they have made their people at least professedly children of their God; they have then done their Subjects the greatest good, when they have put a stop to sin which is their greatest evil; they are then most like Gods, when by their power the people are less like Devils: they may save souls by the loss of sensuality, save life by the loss of unbounded liberty, save the truth by the casting over-board the sinking weight of humane innovations, save the Church by the necessary allay into some common mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of inconsistent parties and principles, and entail happiness upon the Throne by setting up holiness and truth in all their people. What <hi>Cyprian</hi> writes to the Confessors, shall close up this, for us in our lower, or Princes in their greater elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Ea concedere quae in perniciem populi vertant est decipere; nec erigitur sic lapsus sed per offensam dei magis impellitur ad ruinam.</hi>

If in other things of temporal importance this mutation shall bring any impairing or loss, yet I shall say, as <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused by <hi>Ziba,</hi> No matter, forasmuch as my Lord the King is returned home in peace to his own house.</p>
            <p>2. Be exhorted to pray for your Superior Powers; that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as their glory lies in the grace and goodness of their people, God would bless them with being effectually instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal that this Nation may become a City of righteousness, a faithful people. This is the flower of their Crown, and you may be useful to the adorning of the Imperial Diadem with it; not only <hi>by your practice,</hi> that it may be said and observed by all, that since his royal Majesty sat upon his Throne, iniquity and sin wither'd and perished, blush'd and was ashamed in all his people, and that the prophaness of your spirits could not breath and live in the purer air of his pious princely Government; but also <hi>by your prayers,</hi> that God would under the impressions of his Soveraignty keep his Saints from being persecuted, his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths from being prophaned, his Ministers from being despised or impoverished, men now pretending to be Ministers, but such whose right eye is utterly darkned, of desperate life and despica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble knowledge, from being advanced, his Worship from being corrupted, his Ordinances from being defiled, his Sacraments from being disorderly administred, his Name from being blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, the Antichristian state and apostacy from being encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, profession from being scorned, and the liberty of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God and his people from being abridged or invaded; and in stead thereof, that God would lay up his precious truths, Ordinances and People in the most intimate shades of the love and protection, advancement and encouragement of his royal Majesty; and so shall this and after-generations call him blessed.</p>
            <p>3. Lastly, As we expect the full accumulation of these bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings upon us, Oh! let your dross be purely purged; cease not till the way to these royal priviledges be fully prepared by the purging away of that filth from the daughter of <hi>Zion,</hi> which as hitherto it hath debarr'd us from that mercy we now enjoy, so if still not purged thoroughly, may render even this blessing, but as the shell and shadow of a deliverance, destitute of that which is
