            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable, the Lords of His Majeſties Privy Councell of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland: The humble Petition of many Noblemen, Barons, Burgeſſes, and Miniſters thereof, preſented at</hi> Edenbrough <hi>the laſt of</hi> May, 1642.</head>
            <opener>Moſt humbly ſheweth,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat Whereas they upon the report and ſight of great Convocations, ſuddenly indeavored and unepexctedly brought in to this Great Counſell day, for the moſt part by thoſe who have been eſteemed by the Countrey, and challenged by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as Incendiaries, Plotters and Enemies to the Peace of their Kingdoms; Have occaſionally conveened at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough:</hi> and having heard of Letters from His Majeſty, and Declarations from the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> anent the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſtractions of that Kingdom, They have reaſon, from bygone experience and preſent preſumptions, To feare the Intentions and Endevors of thoſe evil affected perſons and their Adherents, left by their Convocations and ſolicitations they take occaſion of theſe differences, to raiſe Jealouſie and Diviſion betwixt their Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>And conſidering the common Intereſt of all the Subiects of this Kingdome, to preſerve the late peace ſo happily concluded betwixt their Nations, by the Providence of God, His Majeſties Goodneſſe and Wiſedome, and the Mediation of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo ſolemnly eſtabliſhed by the late Treaty, Oath of Parliament, publike Faith, and great Seals of their Kingdoms; as in all other points, ſo eſpecially in thoſe Articles (whereunto, the reſt are called but Prefaces) for ſetling and entertaining a ſolid Peace betwixt their Nations in time coming, left upon any pretence they ſhould be daſhed one againſt another: Wherein it is declared, The duty of the Eſtates, yea, of every Subject, to convene and ſuppreſſe any evill-affected perſons who would raiſe Arms againſt the Subjects of the other Kingdome, without Conſent of Parliament, as Traytors to the Eſtate, much more to petition againſt it. And wherein there is appointed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Eſtates, for the conſervation of this Peace in the Interim betwixt Parliaments: All which the Petitioners (amongſt the reſt of the good Subjects of this Kingdome) did hazzard their Lives and Eſtates to obtain. And did demand in the Treaty, upon their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Experience of the Councell of <hi>England</hi> their medling in the Affairs betwixt His Majeſty and this Kingdome, to the engaging of the Nations in Warre, which is ſo oft condemned by the Eſtates of this Kingdome, in their Remonſtrances, preſſing that common Rule of Equity, TO DO AS WE WOULD BE DONE UNTO, which now is, and may be retorted on this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe deſiring earneſtly, That your Lordſhips, in theſe publike Reſolutions, of ſo great Conſequence to their Dominions, may carry along with you the Hearts and Conſciences of the Body of this Kingdome; And prevent that the Breach grow not wider by falſe confidences, grounded upon ſudden undertakings of any perſons: As alſo their Naturall Affection and Duty to their gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, according to their manifold Obligations, and brotherly Affection to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> forcing them to pray to God, and to deſire all men, according to their Stations, to uſe all lawfull Means, to breed and entertain a good underſtanding betwixt His Majeſty and His Parliament, The ſureſt Foundation of Greatneſſe to His Majeſty, and Happineſſe to their Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe taking to heart the dangerous Conſequences to His Majeſty, and to His Dominions, if your Lordſhips anſwer, by tendering the offer of your Service to His Majeſty, againſt the demands, or upon the differences betwixt His Majeſty and the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> or any other manner of way import (which God forbid) any engaging of your ſelves, or of their Nations in War, or any thing that may tend thereunto.</p>
            <p>Therefore, In their own Names, and in Name of the reſt of the Nobility, Gentry, Burgeſſes, and Miniſters, whoſe hearts do, and hands would go along with this Petition, for preſervation of Peace betwixt their Kingdomes; They do in all humility and earneſtneſſe, petition your Lordſhips, in the deep of your Wiſedomes, ſeriouſly to ponder the Conſequences of your anſwer to His Majeſty and the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> at this time; ſo that thereby, neither the Confidence betwixt His Maieſty and His good Subiects here, nor amongſt themſelves, nor betwixt the Kingdomes (theſe Unions ſtanding ever to his Maieſties Greatneſſe, and thoſe Diviſions to His preiudice) may be any wayes weakned, or their Peace endangered; Unto that end as your Lordſhips would leave no lawfull means, according to your Intereſt, unaſſayed, for begetting a good underſtanding betwixt His Majeſty and His Parliament, being His Greateſt, and moſt Impartiall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, repreſenting the Body, whereof His Maieſty is the Head; and for removing theſe diſtractions (the continuance whereof, will ever trouble the Peace of this Kingdome) according to your Lordſhips laſt anſwer; So alſo, ſeeing His Majeſty requires not that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips ſhould (neither can your Lordſhips) judge of the Laws and Proceedings of another independent Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> offers to give all Satisfaction concerning any Meſſage or Papers ſent to your Lordſhips annent their Proceedings, That your Lordſhips would be pleaſed carefully to ſhun all offers of Reall or Verball engagements, either directly, or by way of Inference, without conſent of Parliament, conformed to the Treaty, which either may give any juſt occaſion of offence to their Gracious Soveraign, or of Jealouſie to their Brethren of <hi>England,</hi> or of diſcourſe unto any, as if your Lordſhips did not obſerve that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Rule of Equity, preſſed by them during their troubles, TO DO UNTO OTHERS. AS THEY WOULD BE DONE UNTO THEMSELVES, But did fall in the ſame faults which your Lordſhips, and the reſt of the Eſtates of this Kingdom had condemned in the Councell of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for this effect, they cannot but remember your Lordſhips, That according to an Article of the Treaty, there was appointed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion (as independant as any other) of ſo many of every Eſtate, repreſenting the whole Kingdome, to prevent all occaſion of Diviſion betwixt their Kingdomes, in the Interim betwixt Parliaments. All which they humbly repreſent unto your Lordſhips wiſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and expects from your Lordſhips ſo gracious an anſwer as may ſatisfie their preſent fears, and ſecure them from thoſe dangers in this Interim betwixt Parliaments, and thereby prevent all neceſſity of Petitions of this kinde.</p>
