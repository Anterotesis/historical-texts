            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The news of the horrid Rebellion, broke out in the Weſtern parts of this Kingdom, ſhrouding it ſelf under the wonted co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours that all ſuch Villanies aſſume, occaſioned my offering theſe following thoughts, in the next ordinary courſe of my Preaching, to my Country and plain Auditory; of whom it pleaſes me to tell your Lordſhip, that I hope and beleive they have heartily received the Doctrines of Loyalty to their Prince, and Duty to the Church, as a part of their Religion.</p>

And concerning this mean Publication, I will confeſs, My Lord, that I was not unwilling, by it, to let our Enemies know, that even the moſt inconſiderable of the Clergy of our Church, will yet do their utmoſt to aſſert the glorious Doctrines of it, whenever bold and malicious men ſhall attempt the diſhonoring of any of them.</p>
            <p>And I hope 'tis not amiſs for your Lordſhip to receive ſome Teſtimonies to prove, That thoſe of us, that judge ourſelves the meaneſt of our Reverend Brethren, among whom we are, will yet never, By Divine Aſſiſtance, deſert the great and hitherto victorious <hi>Champions</hi> of our Church and Cauſe: But that by our Practiſing and Preaching the Doctrines of ſound and undefiled Religion toward God, and of entire and unfeigned Loyalty to our Prince; we ſhall endeavour to Continue to After Ages, the Memory and Records of what Principles our Church has taught us, and what we have taught our People.</p>

            <p>A Doctrine that is at all times proper and uſeful to be taught, though it has had the misfortune that attends ſeveral other excellent parts of Chriſtian Religion, I mean, to be looked upon, even by the greateſt pretenders to Piety, as a matter of but very little conſequence; and if it be acknowledged to contain any thing of neceſſity in it, yet ſome evil inſtructors of our People have taught them to clog it with ſo many limitations, that in truth it comes but to very little with ſome of them. But however that be, yet they have effectually diſcovered their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to remove this neceſſary and excellent Doctrine of our Religion as far from that, as they have from their own Breaſts. Certain it is, and our ſad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has but too too much confirmed it, that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of all our Exhortations to the contrary, they had ſo far inſinuated their own prejudices into the minds of all that did but a little favour them, that thoſe of them that would not altogether diſown the Obligations of our Religion in this particular portion
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40521:4"/>
of it, did yet freely and openly cenſure our publick Diſcourſes on that Subject, as <hi>mean, inſipid</hi> and <hi>unedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying,</hi> and hardly ſo good as <hi>Moral Preaching;</hi> which (by the way) is a diſgraceful leſſening Phraſe, as they imagin, which the Leaders of the Faction have invented, thereby to render our Exhortations to the Performance of the very chiefeſt parts of Practical Religion deſpicable, and ſo ineffectual to thoſe for whoſe ſakes we chiefly intended them, and who in truth, through the crafty inſinuations of ſuch deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Guides, did moſt need them.</p>
            <p>But indeed, this was a neceſſary though a Helliſh Policy; for they did well enough foreſee, that if we could but perſuade Men to the careful practiſe of Humility, Peace and Charity among one another, and of Submiſſion and Obedience to their lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours in Church and State, <hi>Thoſe Fundamentals of our Religion,</hi> it would quickly and unavoidably have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated all their Factious and Schiſmatical Deſigns, which moſt palpably have ſucceeded, but in the ſame Proportions, that thoſe lovely and happy Virtues have decayed among us.</p>
            <p>It is evident then that a Diſcourſe of this Nature could at no time be unſeaſonable to People in our Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. But I have judged it more peculiarly proper, to entertain you with a plain and honeſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to a firm and ſincere Loyalty; and from this particular Topick, as 'tis a Fundamental of the Religion we Profeſs, now, when there are found them among us, that have entred into an open and damnable Rebellion againſt their Natural Prince upon that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40521:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that have the impudence to Publiſh the maintaining and ſupporting that, for their deſign, which they have already, by their deſperate Actions, violated and diſhonoured in one of its moſt ſacred ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and which does particularly recommend the Care and Practiſe of it to the World.</p>
            <p>I do not believe that you that hear me, have any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular need to be <hi>now</hi> Admoniſhed of this part of your Duty; but yet to diſcover the ſteadineſs of our own Principles, that I might prevent any of you from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much as alienated from your Duty in your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or wheadled into thinking well of ſuch pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, by the Cry of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> that I might lead you not only to a diſlike, but an utter abhorrence of ſuch wretched Principles, as can never tend to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or promote our Religion, but to diſhonour and ruin it, and that are as contrary to your happineſs in another World, as they are deſtructive of your intereſt in this. I have choſen to be obedient to this Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Injunction, <hi>Put them in mind to be ſubject to Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Powers, to obey Magiſtrates, to be ready to every good Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two things I ſhall obſerve from theſe words, which ſhall be the limits of my Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Subjection and Obedience to lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors is ſtrictly and neceſſarily enjoyned by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That all Miniſters of the Evangelick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation are entirely obliged to exhort their ſeveral Hearers to the careful and conſcionable Practiſe of this, as their juſt and neceſſary Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:40521:5"/>
And Firſt, Of the firſt of theſe.</p>
            <p>That ſubjection and obedience to Magiſtrates and lawful Governors is ſtrictly and neceſſarily enjoyned by Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>And becauſe I remember to whom I am ſpeaking, I will not therefore enter into any tedious debates of the meaſures of this Obedience, and how far it ought to be extended: For though it is moſt true, that ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have uſed their utmoſt care to perplex this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with all imaginable difficulties, and the Caſuiſts of both extremes from us have equally conſpired it, and to that purpoſe have clog'd it with a whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Limitations and Proviſo's, and will be putting of Caſes, <hi>(of Conſcience they call them)</hi> ſome hugely falſe, others ſilly and impertinent, that never did, and 'tis but juſt poſſible to ſuppoſe that ever they ſhould need a Reſolution while the World endures under any ſort of Government whatever; yet moſt certainly this Duty of Loyalty and Subjection to Governours, as all other Lines of Practical Religion, is in it ſelf direct, and eaſie to be drawn, hugely intelligible, and obvious to the meaneſt capacity, difficult to none but thoſe that are loth to practiſe it, and in this alſo it agrees with the reſt of thoſe incomparable Virtues in the Chriſtian Inſtitution, that are of equal Neceſſity and Glory with it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And we need nothing more to prove how eaſie this Duty is to be underſtood, than to conſider the meek and obliging temper of mind that Chriſtian Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in all its Votaries, and which it does alſo where Men are truly ſeized with the powers of it moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40521:5"/>
produce; and alſo what every one of us in all caſes where we have authority, expect from thoſe that depend upon us, and ſo are ſubject to us.</p>
            <p>I will therefore in few words give you the ſum of this whole Duty of Religion: and it comes to thus much.</p>
            <p>That that Obedience which by the Laws of Chriſtianity we owe to our Governours, muſt be Active in all caſes whatſoever, where we are not certain that the ſame Laws have laid upon us any prior Obligation to the contrary; for then the Apoſtles, St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> have anſwered for us, to the Council that commanded them <hi>to preach no more in the name of Jeſus,</hi> Acts 4. 18, 19, <hi>Whether it be right in the ſight of God to hearken to you more than unto God, judg you.</hi> But we muſt be certain then, for we all know that a doubting conſcience is no Judg, neither lays any Obligation, for it paſſes no ſentence: And further, the ſafer ſide muſt be choſen, which is, that we do not make our ſelves guilty of a certain ſin by declining Obedience to the Magiſtrate, upon the ſcore of avoiding that, which we cannot affirm to be evil. And moreover in ſuch caſes, where 'tis moſt plain that the Laws of our Religion will not allow us to be <hi>Active,</hi> in our Obedience to the Commands of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, yet then the ſame Laws oblige us to be <hi>Subject, i. e.</hi> to withdraw our poſitive Obedience, in ſuch caſes where, becauſe of our Obligations to a greater Authority, we dare not comply with theirs, with Modeſty, Meekneſs, Reſpect and Reverence to their Perſons and Authority, and if they pleaſe to puniſh us for ſo doing, to bear it pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, and without reproaching or reſiſting. So that this is the ſum of all. Our Religion obliges us actively to obey our Prince in every of his Commands, where God has not interpoſed his Authority, and to reſiſt in no caſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:40521:6"/>
There are only two things that are material to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before I enter upon the proof of the Propoſition I named.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, that when I affirm the <hi>Doctrine of Loyalty and Obedience to our Prince,</hi> to be Eſſential to Chriſtianity, I do not intend to be underſtood that it is peculiar to that body of Laws, or that it was firſt made a Law by Chriſt, <hi>but that 'tis ſtrictly provided for by his Religion,</hi> ſo that he cannot be a good Chriſtian that is not a Loyal Subject; nay, I am ſure 'tis no venture to affirm, <hi>That this Doctrine is better taught and more ſtrongly enforced by the Laws of the Goſpel than by thoſe of any other Religion in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I would have it be obſerved that I reckon and take it for granted, that all the Laws of common <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Equity,</hi> and ſuch as are the foundations of all <hi>Humane Societies</hi> are part of the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ſo that whatever Duty we owe to Governours by virtue of any of the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Society,</hi> that we muſt acknowledg to be part of our <hi>Chriſtian Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I ſhall conſider our Obligations to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Subjection</hi> to our <hi>Governours</hi> in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Particulars.</p>
            <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> Nothing can be more proper to begin with in this caſe, than the Determinations of our great <hi>Law giver,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Founder</hi> of our <hi>Religion.</hi> And he while he was upon Earth did, with great clearneſs of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> aſſert the <hi>Obedience</hi> that was due to <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and did deliver it as a part of that <hi>Religion</hi> he came to eſtabliſh in the World. When the Queſtion was put to him to know his <hi>Judgment</hi> about one part of the <hi>ſubjection</hi> we owe to <hi>Governours,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers his mind in an <hi>

Now we may ſee by the companions which the Spirit of God has aſſigned to, <hi>Seditions and Hereſies,</hi> that theſe are of the ſame Immoral and Damnable nature with the other. And the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40521:8"/>

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Divine Original</hi> of <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> proves ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to it a neceſſary portion of that <hi>Religion</hi> which has God for its Author. And it is a <hi>Concluſive Argument</hi> that that <hi>Religion</hi> never came from Heaven, that teaches or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages any oppoſition of that <hi>Authority,</hi> which God himſelf has ſet up in the World: For if <hi>Satan be not divided againſt Satan,</hi> moſt certainly then the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of Almighty God is always conſiſtent with it ſelf. And moreover all the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt confuſions that could happen in the World would be faſtned upon the wiſe <hi>Governor</hi> of it, if when he had ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Sovereignty</hi> among men, he ſhould allow or encourage the reſiſting of them.</p>
            <p>Now that the Origine of <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> is from God, is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40521:8"/>
evident from many places of <hi>Holy Writ.</hi> Hence <hi>Kings</hi> are called <hi>Gods,</hi> Pſal. 82. 6, <hi>And the Children of the moſt Highest.</hi> Not only as being concerned in his eſpecial care, mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and proviſion, but alſo as partaking of his <hi>Authority,</hi> and having that in them which is an emanation from, and reſemblance of his own <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> And <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15, <hi>By me Kings Reign and Princes Decree Juſtice.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 2. 21. tells <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, That 'tis God that ſetteth up Kings.</hi> And therefore they are called the <hi>Lords Anointed.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the fore-quoted place, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms <hi>the Powers that be to be Ordained of God;</hi> and that <hi>they which reſiſt the Power, reſiſt the Ordinance of God,</hi> which 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that nothing that comes from God can in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eſtabliſhment of things teach to do.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever therefore has been impiouſly pretended to the contrary, 'tis evident that the <hi>Original</hi> of <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> is Divine, and conſequently if our <hi>Religion</hi> be ſo too, it muſt teach a reverence and ſubmiſſion to thoſe, that have their <hi>Powers</hi> delegate from the <hi>Great Governor</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthiy,</hi> If it be conſidered that <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and the not reſiſting their <hi>Authority,</hi> be abſolutely neceſſary for the <hi>Peace</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and to ſecure the undeniable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of all <hi>Mankind;</hi> it will from thence, I think, clearly follow, that 'tis a neceſſary portion of <hi>Chriſtian Religion:</hi> For, I think, 'tis a Propoſition Univerſally true, That whatſoever is truly neceſſary for the Intereſt of <hi>Mankind</hi> in their ſeveral <hi>Societies</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> to each other, is in the <hi>Moral Obligations</hi> to it, effectually provided for, and ſecured by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now 'tis impoſſible but all muſt own that nothing can be more abſolutely and immediately deſtructive to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of all <hi>Societies</hi> of men, than <hi>diſobedience</hi> to, and <hi>reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>Governors</hi> of them, and conſequently upon that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40521:9"/>
very account, it muſt be repugnant to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing the whole World has more entirely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in than the abſolute neceſſity of <hi>Government;</hi> without which all thoſe intolerable miſchiefs would enſue, which every gratification of a private <hi>Humour</hi> or <hi>Euſt</hi> could Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Governours</hi> ſtands upon the ſame invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Neceſſities that <hi>Government</hi> it ſelf does; for without this, the other is but a name and a ſpeculation, impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſubſiſt or to ſerve any of the needs of <hi>Mankind.</hi> I will name a few of thoſe horrible miſchiefs, that would certainly deſtroy the Peace of the World, if the reſiſting <hi>Governors</hi> were upon any pretext allowed lawful.</p>
            <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> Every private mans <hi>Rights, Liberty</hi> and <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> would be expoſed to every Invaſion, and could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be fixed with any ſort of certainty or ſafety. Search the <hi>Annals</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and ſee if theſe darlings of <hi>Mankind</hi> were not always expoſed to <hi>Rapine</hi> and <hi>Ruin,</hi> whenever the <hi>Sovereign Power</hi> has been reſiſted; 'tis the natural and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Conſequent of a <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt the <hi>Supreme Governor,</hi> to ſpoil and oppreſs particular Perſons. The ſtories of our own <hi>Late Horrible Confuſions</hi> are freſh enough in mens memories to prove this to be true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Liberty and Property</hi> has been the cry of the <hi>Faction</hi> a long time. It was to ſecure theſe as they pretended, that they raiſed that <hi>Horrid Rebellion</hi> during the Reign of that <hi>Royal Martyr</hi> of Bleſſed Memory, the Father of our preſent <hi>Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Monarch,</hi> and the remaining Ruins of many Families and Eſtates can witneſs how well they did it.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Preſent Rebellion</hi> will give a good account, no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, of the preſervation of the <hi>Liberties</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of men when we ſhall know how many honeſt People are
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40521:9"/>
undone by their <hi>Violences</hi> and <hi>Outrages,</hi> beſides what the <hi>Actors</hi> in it have expoſed themſelves to from <hi>publick Juſtice,</hi> which if God be merciful to us will ſhortly overtake them.</p>
            <p>And moreover, if one <hi>Traytor</hi> ſucceeds in his <hi>Attempts,</hi> the ſame or better <hi>Principles</hi> will induce others to diſobey him, and ſo there is no end of <hi>Confuſion</hi> and <hi>Diſorder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If it might be admitted lawful on any <hi>Pretext</hi> whatſoever, to <hi>reſiſt Governors,</hi> unleſs the reſerved caſes were effectually ſtated, publiſhed and owned, which I think is not poſſible to be ſuppoſed, the <hi>miſchievous effects</hi> would be the ſame, as if it might be done on any account without reſerve.</p>
            <p>And if this were done, yet we know that the <hi>Populace</hi> is ſo eaſily wheadled by the <hi>Heads</hi> of a <hi>Faction,</hi> with the noiſe of a few taking words; and are ſo ready to receive any <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> that may <hi>prejudice</hi> them againſt their <hi>Governors,</hi> and ſo eaſie and forward to determine in <hi>favour</hi> of thoſe that dare to <hi>oppoſe</hi> them, that if there ſhould have been but one reſerved caſe in which it were lawful to <hi>reſiſt,</hi> 'tis no hard thing to believe that all and every thing would have been drawn to it; and one ſuch exempted caſe would have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred all <hi>Government</hi> unable to preſerve it ſelf, and liable to be <hi>unhinged</hi> by every <hi>Deſigning Rebel,</hi> that has but cunning enough to manage the <hi>Many Headed Beaſt,</hi> into the clamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of his <hi>Pretences</hi> and abetting his <hi>Deſigns,</hi> than which nothing can ſooner or more certainly deſtroy the beſt and wiſeſt eſtabliſhments of any <hi>Society</hi> of men in the <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another <hi>miſchievous effect</hi> of <hi>oppoſing Magiſtrates,</hi> is the Letting and Diſturbing the courſe of <hi>publick Juſtice,</hi> in all its <hi>Branches,</hi> which thing alone neceſſitates the decay of a Community; and which naturally reſults from that evil I am diſſwading from.</p>
            <p>For when <hi>Governors</hi> are forced to take care to ſecure
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40521:10"/>
themſelves againſt <hi>Rebellion</hi> and <hi>Invaſion</hi> of their <hi>Authority,</hi> how can they be at <hi>Liberty</hi> or indeed have the <hi>Power,</hi> (if the Party that oppoſes them be Formidable) of ſecuring the <hi>Rights</hi> of their <hi>Subjects</hi> by the peaceable <hi>Adminiſtrations</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For then <hi>Malefactors</hi> that are ſingle eſcape from <hi>Juſtice</hi> to make up the <hi>force and numbers</hi> of them that Invade it: And indeed of ſuch <hi>Dregs</hi> of <hi>Mankind</hi> do ſuch Tumults general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſt.</p>
            <p>Then private differences about <hi>Property</hi> muſt be delayed, 'till it be ſeen whether the <hi>Government</hi> be able to ſupport it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſecure the execution of its own moſt juſt Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. And in the mean time 'tis not unlikely that all that do wrong will be at leaſt abettors of thoſe that <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Authority,</hi> if it be but that they may the longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations</hi> upon the <hi>Rights</hi> of their <hi>Neighbours;</hi> and the injured Perſon has his wrong greatned to him by the delay, and is diſcouraged too in his <hi>Obedience</hi> to thoſe that ſhould and can't relieve him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That I may <hi>Epitomize</hi> the proof of this whole matter. It ſhall be ſufficient to add, the conſideration of the ſad ſtories of our <hi>Late Confuſions.</hi> How many are there ſtill among us that need no more than their own <hi>Memory</hi> and <hi>Obſervation</hi> to convince them, that nothing can be a greater plague to a <hi>Society</hi> of men in every reſpect, than a <hi>Popular Rage?</hi> And thoſe of us that did not live in thoſe days, yet cannot ſure be altogether ignorant of the <hi>wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed effects</hi> of that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian Anarchy,</hi> if we have but a little conſidered the occurrences of our own time.</p>
            <p>We can never be ſo liable to be injured by the worſt of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> as by the <hi>Invaſions</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> under any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatever. And moreover, every man, I think, can bear a wrong or injury from his <hi>Prince</hi> with more <hi>patience</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:40521:10"/>
and leſs <hi>vexation,</hi> than he can from the <hi>unruly Rage</hi> of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior</hi> or <hi>Servant,</hi> or thoſe that he has <hi>maintained</hi> by his <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> and yet theſe we muſt expect, and ſuffer, whenever <hi>Rebellion</hi> breaks out; as is evident from the Hiſtory of the <hi>Late Times,</hi> (as we call them) in very many Examples, <hi>Tragical</hi> enough. I am perſuaded that I am not miſtaken when I affirm that there were more Acts of <hi>Violence, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, Cruelty, Injuſtice</hi> and <hi>Irreligion,</hi> committed in this our Nation, during the few years of the prevailing of that <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> and <hi>Execrable Rebellion</hi> over us, than can be found in all our Hiſtories to have been done by all the <hi>Male-Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> though ſurveyed with never ſo much prejudiced Judgments. How many among us, both in their Perſons and Eſtates, do bear thoſe ſcars, that are at once the loud Proclaimers of the <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of them that wear them, and alſo of the <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Rage</hi> of them that gave them?</p>
            <p>If then it be evident, as I think 'tis, from all has been offered on this particular, that <hi>Obedience, Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> to <hi>Governors,</hi> is the undeniable Intereſt of Mankind, it follows ſtrongly, that 'tis effectually provided for and ſecured by the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> For the Son of God, when he founded his <hi>Church</hi> by the delivering his <hi>Religion</hi> to the <hi>World,</hi> that all men, and particularly <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Governors,</hi> might not want any ſort of motives that might be proper to recommend it to their <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Protection</hi> of it, took effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual care, by eſtabliſhing the <hi>Duties</hi> of men one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of all men to their <hi>Rulers,</hi> upon the ſame forcible <hi>Obligations</hi> and <hi>Penalties,</hi> that he did thoſe to God himſelf, to ſecure ſo perſuaſive an Argument, as that of the Intereſt of all <hi>Societies</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> of men, on the behalf of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> he was then to eſtabliſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I will go on to prove the truth of my Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40521:11"/>
from one of the Grand Deſigns and Intendments of <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> in the World, to which, reſiſting of <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors</hi> is utterly contrary. Now one of the great purpoſes of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was the eſtabliſhing of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> among men. See how it was Propheſied before of the days of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> Iſa. 11. 6, 7, 8, 9, <hi>The Wolf ſhall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard ſhall lye down with the Kid—And the Lyon ſhall eat ſtraw like the Oxe—</hi>And the Reaſon is given, <hi>Ver.</hi> 9, <hi>For the Earth ſhall be full of the knowledg of the Lord as the Waters co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Seas.</hi> The <hi>Author</hi> of our <hi>Religion</hi> is called, <hi>The Prince of Peace,</hi> was born in a time of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Peace,</hi> and at his Birth the <hi>Heavenly Anthem</hi> ſung by Angels, was, <hi>Peace on Earth, Good Will towards,</hi> or among <hi>men:</hi> When he was going out of the World, his Bleſſing was, <hi>Peace I leave with you, my Peace I give unto you,</hi> Joh. 14. 27. And while he converſed with his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> he makes <hi>Charity</hi> to become the very <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> Joh. 13. 35, <hi>Hereby ſhall all men know that you are my Diſciples, if you have love one to another.</hi> The whole Inſtitution that he left, I mean the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> is called the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Peace.</hi> He that ſent him to reveal it, is the <hi>God of Peace,</hi> the Meſſage and Commands it carries do correſpond, <hi>Live peaceably with all men. Follow Peace, without which no man ſhall ſee God,</hi> is the one half of that which is of ſo abſolute neceſſity to happineſs, that it can never be attained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. But how effectually and ſummarily all this is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by reſiſting of <hi>Governors</hi> is ſo plain that it needs no Proof.</p>
            <p>And moreover, which was hinted before, 'tis utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with that temper of mind that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires in all that pretend to eſpouſe it; even <hi>Meekneſs, Charity, Gentleneſs,</hi> and the like. All which it requires ſo <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and <hi>abſolutely,</hi> ſo <hi>univerſally,</hi> and without the leaſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of <hi>exception,</hi> that 'tis impoſſible for him to be a <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:40521:11"/>
I mean, to be able to pretend to the leaſt ſhadow of <hi>Piety,</hi> that acts contray to ſuch a temper; for he is a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious oppoſer of the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in its greateſt <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,</hi> and in deſpight of all other <hi>Varniſhes</hi> and <hi>Pretences</hi> whatever, this alone pulls of the <hi>Vizard,</hi> and preſents him to the World as a ſtranger to the <hi>efficacy</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> if he be a <hi>Contentious</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitable</hi> man, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22, 23, <hi>The fruit of the ſpirit,</hi> i. e. what it certainly works in that mind where it inhabits, <hi>is Love—Peace, Long-ſuffering, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, Goodneſs, Meekneſs,</hi> &amp;c. ſo many ſeveral names being given to the ſame Eſſential Virtue of <hi>Charity</hi> does eaſily teach us how it delighted the holy, kind and charitable Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Jeſus, to impreſs ſuch <hi>Characters</hi> upon all that ſhould own and believe its <hi>Revelations.</hi> And again, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12, 13, <hi>Put on therefore as the Elect of God,</hi> i. e. as become thoſe that are dear to, and highly valued of God, <hi>bowels of Mercies, Kindneſs, Humbleneſs of mind, Meekneſs, Long-ſuffering;</hi> theſe are thoſe parts of our <hi>Religion</hi> that are ſo cloſely recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us, and that render us highly beloved and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed of God, becauſe they do conſtitute in us a God-like temper of mind, and make us <hi>the Children of our Father which is in Heaven,</hi> and becauſe the Practiſe of them renders our <hi>Religion</hi> truly <hi>Glorious</hi> and <hi>Lovely</hi> in the World. Now <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> and <hi>Diſobedience</hi> to <hi>Governors</hi> muſt needs be wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with this temper of mind that is before deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, foraſmuch as it ariſes from Rancour, Diſcontent, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, Ambition, Cruelty, Impatience, Pride, Peeviſhneſs, and the like evil habits of mind, which how well they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with what the Evangelick Inſtitutes do require and promote in us, let all men that know them judg.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Another thing that inevitably concludes for what I have been ſo earneſtly exhorting you to, and is a reſult of what I laſt named, is the conſideration of that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40521:12"/>
due ſubmiſſion to, and acquieſcing in the diſpoſals of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence</hi> concerning us and all we have, which we are bound to, both by <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Revealed Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſuſpect that you do ſo little underſtand your <hi>Religion,</hi> as to go about to prove that contentment, or a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient abiding the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> concerning us is our <hi>Duty.</hi> And a very little of Diſcourſe will ſhew you how contrary reſiſting of <hi>ſupream Powers</hi> is to all that. For,</p>
            <p>Put the caſe that we be under all the <hi>Ills, Hardſhips,</hi> and <hi>Calamities</hi> that can be ſuppoſed, nay, and more and greater than can be ſuppoſed, from our <hi>Governors,</hi> is it not ſtill the <hi>Great Ruler</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> that has appointed us this ſtate, and if we <hi>Contrive</hi> and <hi>Endeavour</hi> to free our ſelves from it by <hi>force</hi> of <hi>Arms,</hi> what is it but violent and deſperate <hi>reſiſting the Ordinance of God,</hi> concerning our ſelves? 'Tis <hi>Rebellion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Great Monarch</hi> of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe,</hi> and declining that ſervice he enjoyns us. What is it but a <hi>wicked Reſolve</hi> to break the <hi>Mighty Courſe</hi> of his <hi>Counſels?</hi> or at beſt but a fruitleſs <hi>Attempt</hi> to free our ſelves by our own force from that condition of life, which not ſo much his <hi>Vice-gerent,</hi> as he himſelf has diſpoſed to us? 'Tis telling the <hi>World,</hi> and <hi>God Almighty</hi> to his face, we will not be as he would have us. 'Tis a <hi>Gyant-like War,</hi> and no leſs than an endeavour to fling his <hi>Providence</hi> out of the <hi>Earth,</hi> which is next door to the pulling him out of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Contentment</hi> then and <hi>Reſignation</hi> of ourſelves to the Conduct of <hi>Divine Providence</hi> is a neceſſary part of <hi>practical Religion</hi> is, allowed me, and I need ſay no more to prove how well reſiſting of <hi>Sovereign Powers</hi> agree with that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> And to conclude this whole matter, I have to prove, that <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Subjection</hi> to <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary part of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> the example of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Confeſſors</hi> of old.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:40521:12"/>
The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> I have accounted for before, and now I ſuper-add, that he did further <hi>explain</hi> and <hi>enforce</hi> that by his <hi>example.</hi> How willingly he yielded himſelf to thoſe that accompanied the <hi>Traytor</hi> that <hi>delivered</hi> him! How meekly he behaved himſelf when before their <hi>Judicatures!</hi> How evidently he declared (when he told <hi>Pilate, My King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this World)</hi> that nothing of that <hi>Power</hi> he then managed himſelf, and had delegated it to others to do it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, ſhould ever Interfere with, or tend to leſſen the <hi>Authority</hi> that was derived to him from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or that of any other <hi>publick Magiſtrate</hi> to the end of the <hi>World!</hi> How calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he received the <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> the moſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt</hi> that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was <hi>Pronounced!</hi> How patiently he reſigned himſelf to the <hi>Execution,</hi> the moſt <hi>Barbarous</hi> that ever was <hi>Perpetrated!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this ſure was not through any deficiency of <hi>Power</hi> in him to have delivered himſelf, or confounded thoſe that ſo maliciouſly treated him; for though there have been found that have impudently enough Blaſphemed the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Confeſſors,</hi> with this <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>malicious ſuggeſtion,</hi> yet here I hope they will be ſilent.</p>
            <p>Neither can they ſure be ſo <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> as to pretend this <hi>Example</hi> of the <hi>meek Lamb of God,</hi> inimitable; and that all the reaſon of his <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> was the <hi>fulfilling of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and the capacitating himſelf for that <hi>great Work</hi> of <hi>Expiation,</hi> and Attoning <hi>Divine Diſpleaſure,</hi> if they do but remember, that we are commanded by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſpeaking in one of his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> Heb. 12. 2, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>To look unto Jeſus, the Author and finiſher of our faith, who for the joy that was ſet before him endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame—</hi>And to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him that endured ſuch contradiction of ſinners againſt himſelf, leſt we ſhould be wearied and faint in our minds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And moreover when we conſider all the <hi>Glorious Patterns</hi> of an <hi>Illuſtrious Patience,</hi> ſet before us by men of like <hi>Paſſions</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:40521:13"/>
with our ſelves, the <hi>Holy Martyrs</hi> of Antient times, who amidſt all the ſeverities of an <hi>enraged Power,</hi> Heb. 11. 36, 37, 38. <hi>They had Tryals of cruel mockings and ſcourgings, yea, moreover of Bonds, and Impriſonments; they were ſtoned, they were ſawn aſunder, were tempted,</hi> i. e. <hi>to Apoſtatize,</hi> by <hi>flatteries</hi> and <hi>promiſes,</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> juſtly reckons among the <hi>ſevereſt</hi> of their <hi>ſufferings; were ſlain with the ſword, they wandred about in Sheep-skins and Goat-skins, being deſtitute, afflicted, tormented; of whom the World was not worthy,</hi> and yet took all this joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, never tumultuouſly reſiſted the <hi>Powers</hi> that thus <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly</hi> and <hi>unreaſonably</hi> perſecuted them, and if it had been on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for want of <hi>Power,</hi> Why did the Inſpired Pen-man of this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> attribute it to and commend it as an effect of their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope?</hi> I ſay, when we conſider all theſe <hi>Examples,</hi> we may, I think, believe that the force of them would have paſſed into a <hi>Law,</hi> if there had been none in explicite terms <hi>Recorded</hi> in the <hi>Chriſtian Inſtitutes;</hi> but when the <hi>Laws</hi> are plainly delivered, and backed by theſe <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> none but a <hi>Prodigious Impiety</hi> would go about to baffle this <hi>Glorious Principle</hi> of our <hi>Religion,</hi> which at once gives us the opportunity of Publiſhing to the World the <hi>Higheſt Teſtimonies</hi> of our true and unfeigned <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> even of ſuffering for his ſake, which is indeed the Complement and fulfilling of all that God has enjoyned us as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of our <hi>Eternal Happineſs,</hi> and alſo is the great recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of it to all the <hi>Powers</hi> upon <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having in theſe particulars fully aſſerted, and I hope to your ſatisfactions, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Rulers,</hi> as a Fundamental Portion of our <hi>Religion.</hi> I paſs now to the ſecond part of my Diſcourſe, which I ſhall briefly touch, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. That all the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Evangelick Diſpenſation</hi> are ſtrictly obliged by it, to exhort their <hi>Hearers</hi> to the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40521:13"/>
and conſcionable Practiſe of this part of their <hi>Religion</hi> as their juſt and neceſſary <hi>Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is evident alone from this <hi>Apoſtolical Injunction</hi> to him whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> had placed in the next <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Authority</hi> to himſelf, and he ſpeaks it as a thing that they all, both <hi>Preachers</hi> and <hi>Hearers</hi> knew and underſtood, and ſo it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to <hi>put them in mind to be ſubject;</hi> and 'tis plain enough without this particular Command, that we that are <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> being bound to declare the whole <hi>Counſel</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that we might eſcape the <hi>Penalties</hi> that juſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to thoſe, that <hi>handle the Word of God deceitfully,</hi> and that we might be <hi>clear from the Blood of all men,</hi> could never with ſafety to ourſelves, ſilently permit men to be miſtaken in, or ignorant of ſo neceſſary a part of their <hi>Chriſtian Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this particular Command to us, was ſuper-added with a particular reſpect to the <hi>Hereticks</hi> that then were, and ſuch as ſhould afterwards ariſe, <hi>Preaching</hi> another <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> and alſo to give ſtill more publick ſecurity to all <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> in every place where the <hi>Goſpel</hi> came, that the <hi>Religion</hi> eſtabliſhed by it, was ſo far from making any <hi>Invaſion</hi> upon their <hi>Rights,</hi> that it did oblige all its <hi>Followers,</hi> upon ſtricter grounds than any other <hi>Inſtitution</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> to be <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> to their <hi>Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe perhaps there are ſome here that have heard another <hi>Doctrine</hi> taught from this very place, I will therefore Appeal to themſelves, whether it does not much better become a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> in ſpeeding his Commiſſion from the <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> to <hi>Preach</hi> this <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Peace, Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> than to hear them not only vary from, but act quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their <hi>Inſtructions,</hi> in thundring out the furious and extravagant noiſes, of <hi>Curſe you Meroz—</hi>And of <hi>fighting the Lords Battels.</hi> In <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Viſion, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 11, <hi>The Lord</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:40521:14"/>
               <hi>was not in the Earth-quake, nor in the Fire, nor in the ſtrong Wind that rent the Rocks,</hi> but in the <hi>still ſmall Voice;</hi> God was not here, when <hi>Drums</hi> were beaten, and <hi>Trumpets</hi> ſounded from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> but we may believe him here, and expect his bleſſing upon us here, when we cheerfully hearken to his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> that come unto us <hi>Preaching Peace by Jeſus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am perſuaded there are none here but are ſatisfied of the <hi>miſchief</hi> of all ſuch <hi>Principles</hi> as tend to <hi>Rebellion.</hi> And therefore am under no fear of diſpleaſing any of you by this neceſſary freedom.</p>
            <p>I have nothing now to detain me from finiſhing this <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> but only to report the force of all that I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered you by it in the following Inferences.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>Firſt,</hi> It appears from this whole <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> what ſort of men thoſe are, that make <hi>Religion</hi> a pretext for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion:</hi> When yet it does altogether, and upon <hi>unalterable foundations</hi> condemn it, and by all its <hi>Powers</hi> fortifie <hi>Princes</hi> in their <hi>Governments</hi> over their <hi>Subjects.</hi> And has made a better proviſion for the true performance of all <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Homage</hi> to <hi>Princes,</hi> than any other <hi>Religion</hi> has offered or can ever furniſh the <hi>World</hi> withall.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> has <hi>Adopted</hi> the <hi>Dnties</hi> of <hi>Subjects</hi> to their <hi>Sovereigns,</hi> as alſo thoſe of all other <hi>Relations</hi> among men, and made them part of itſelf; and has charged all that <hi>Profeſs</hi> it, upon the ſame <hi>Penalties,</hi> which are the threats of an <hi>endleſs miſery</hi> in a future <hi>ſtate,</hi> with which it eſtabliſhes all its other <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and which no other <hi>Religion</hi> in the <hi>World</hi> can juſtly awe the minds of its <hi>Followers</hi> with, to ſee to the <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Sincere</hi> performance of all the <hi>Duties</hi> they owe one to another, and to thoſe above them, in the ſeveral capacities they are conſidered in, in the <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that <hi>Loyalty</hi> to our <hi>Prince</hi> ſtands upon the ſame bottom in our <hi>Religion,</hi> with <hi>Piety</hi> to <hi>God;</hi> nay, God Almighty has
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40521:14"/>
declared he will never accept any pretended <hi>Worſhip</hi> to himſelf, from ſuch as are <hi>unfaithful</hi> in the <hi>Duties</hi> of their <hi>Relations</hi> to men. <hi>For our hands must be lifted up in Prayer to God without wrath,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 8. And if we have any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, or diſcontented, malicious or furious thoughts, the <hi>ſources</hi> of all <hi>Rebellion,</hi> againſt any man, much more if they be againſt God's <hi>Vice-gerent</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> we muſt not come near his <hi>Altar,</hi> and if we do, 'tis upon our utmoſt <hi>peril,</hi> for we have reaſon to expect nothing but a <hi>Curſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How <hi>wretchedly wicked</hi> then are thoſe, that <hi>Preface</hi> their <hi>Rebellions</hi> with that <hi>Glorious Name,</hi> that condemns them to <hi>Hell,</hi> and how <hi>wilfully blind</hi> muſt they be that believe them?</p>
            <p>For can we think that the <hi>Devils Inſtruments</hi> will ever help to maintain <hi>God's Kingdom;</hi> or that that <hi>Religion</hi> can be protected by <hi>Impiety</hi> and <hi>Diſorder,</hi> whoſe <hi>Principles</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the ſtricteſt <hi>Holineſs</hi> and moſt entire <hi>Peace?</hi> Is <hi>Divine Power</hi> ſo weak that it muſt call in the <hi>Foreign ſupplies</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to maintain its own <hi>Goſpel?</hi> Or ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us be ſo gull'd, as to take part with, or wiſh well to thoſe, that <hi>pretend</hi> indeed the <hi>ſafety</hi> of our <hi>Religion,</hi> but in good earneſt <hi>deſign</hi> only the gratifying of their own <hi>Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious</hi> and <hi>Diſcontented Humours,</hi> though it be in the <hi>ruin</hi> of all that ſhould be <hi>dear</hi> to us? <hi>No!</hi> Let us oppoſe to all the <hi>falſe Colours</hi> with which they would <hi>Honest</hi> their <hi>wicked Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; That they that do evil that good may come, their damnation is just</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This <hi>Goſpel Doctrine</hi> of <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to <hi>Princes,</hi> proves to us, that a <hi>Rebel</hi> to his <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Sovereign,</hi> can never be a good <hi>Chriſtian</hi> towards <hi>God. Sedition</hi> is one of the <hi>fruits</hi> of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and lodges where the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> enters not. <hi>What fellowſhip has Light with Darkneſs, Christ with Belial,</hi> or <hi>Religion</hi> with <hi>Rebellion?</hi> 'Tis the evil and foul <hi>Spirit</hi> that foments ſuch a temper, as this comes from, in the minds

of men to <hi>diſturb</hi> and <hi>ruin Goodneſs</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> under the name of <hi>Protecting</hi> it. For moſt certainly he that nouriſhes <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi> or <hi>Cruelty, Rancour</hi> or <hi>Revenge</hi> in his heart againſt man, but eſpecially againſt his <hi>Sovereign,</hi> never felt, to be ſure, never complyed with, the motions of the <hi>Soft</hi> and <hi>Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Humble</hi> and <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> He that deſpiſes his <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to <hi>man</hi> can never value his <hi>Obligations</hi> to <hi>God;</hi> for ſo one of the <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Infallible Writers</hi> has proved by <hi>undeniable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</hi> as well as determined by <hi>unerring Authority,</hi> 1 John 4. 20, <hi>That he who loveth not his Brother whom he has ſeen,</hi> i. e. He that does not with <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Sincerity,</hi> carefully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all the <hi>Duties</hi> required of him <hi>(For Love is the fulfilling of the Law)</hi> to his <hi>Brother,</hi> i. e. to his Superiors, Inferiors, of Equals, <hi>whom he has ſeen,</hi> i. e. with whom he is <hi>converſant</hi> in the <hi>World,</hi> and to whom he is <hi>bound</hi> by ſo many <hi>ſenſible Obligations,</hi> which are moſt like to prevail upon men; <hi>How can he Love?</hi> i. e. be <hi>Dutiful</hi> and <hi>Obedient</hi> to, <hi>God whom he has not ſeen;</hi> with whom he is not converſant or acquainted?</p>
            <p>And the whole force of the <hi>Argument</hi> is this. That he that is not lead by the motives of his <hi>Interest</hi> for this <hi>World,</hi> and the opportunities of conſtant <hi>converſation,</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> of the <hi>benefits</hi> of it, to do his <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>man,</hi> will never be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by the motives of another <hi>World,</hi> which addreſs only <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and to ſence appear at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and to have but little or no force to move him, to be truly <hi>Obedient</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> a <hi>Being,</hi> that he never ſaid his eyes upon, and has but very ſmall and imperfect notices of.</p>
            <p>And ſo, that I may apply it to my preſent ſcope, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that he that has ſeen and converſed with his <hi>Prince,</hi> and beheld his <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> and thoſe emanations of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> that flow from his <hi>Throne,</hi> and has had the opportunities of ſharing in the <hi>Honours</hi> and <hi>Advantages</hi> that attend ſuch as are near it, and yet has ſo little ſence of all,

as to be a <hi>Traytor</hi> to him, muſt needs have leſs <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> in which only the force of <hi>Religious Obligation</hi> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and ſo muſt unavoidably be falſe to his <hi>Religion</hi> and his <hi>God,</hi> whom he never ſaw, and whoſe <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Majeſty</hi> fall not within his conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I gather hence, that Preaching of <hi>Loyalty</hi> to our <hi>King</hi> is <hi>Soul-ſaving Doctrine,</hi> for not to ſay that <hi>Rebellion</hi> is as <hi>damnable</hi> a <hi>ſin</hi> as <hi>Witchcraft, and ſtubbornneſs as Idolatry:</hi> That <hi>Sedition</hi> does as certainly lead to <hi>Hell,</hi> as any other of the <hi>Works</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> that are ranked with it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. I thus make it appear that <hi>Diſloyal</hi> and <hi>Trayterous Practiſes</hi> are one of the ſhorteſt cuts to an <hi>Eternal Miſery.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>It will be allowed me that <hi>Traytors</hi> ſeldom live long, they are thoſe <hi>bloody and deceitful men that ſhall not live out half their days,</hi> Pſal. 55. 23. They do rarely eſcape the hands of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> and when they are in them, it is not fit they ſhould long be there to occaſion any further <hi>Convulſions</hi> in the <hi>Body Politick;</hi> now when a vicious and a bad life towards God ends in a <hi>Rebellion</hi> againſt his <hi>Prince,</hi> and the <hi>Traytor</hi> is blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his <hi>Deſigns,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> has ſeized him, and within a few days he muſt conclude his <hi>miſerable life</hi> in a more <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable death:</hi> Muſt we not all acknowledg, that 'tis mercy miraculous in the proper ſenſe of that word, that ſhall receive a few <hi>Prayers</hi> in lieu of the <hi>Obedience</hi> of a whole <hi>Life,</hi> and that ſhall conſign him to a happy <hi>Eternity</hi> that perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veres in his ſin 'till he comes to dye for it.</p>
            <p>Since then reſiſting of <hi>Government</hi> does ſo apparently ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard our <hi>eternal ſafety,</hi> I muſt certainly appear to you to ſerve the Intereſts of your Immortalities, when I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade and exhort you to avoid that, which does ſo greatly endanger them; and this is what you have been taught to call <hi>Soul-ſaving Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I have opportunity here to preſent you, as I do,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40521:16"/>
with a moſt hearty and perſuaſive <hi>Addreſs,</hi> that might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you from the <hi>conſideration</hi> of your <hi>Religion,</hi> to reſolve upon a firm, ſteady and unſtained <hi>Loyalty</hi> to his <hi>Majeſty</hi> that now is, <hi>Our Lawful and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndoubted Sovereign, whom God long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve;</hi> that we may none of us ſo much as ſeem to wiſh well to thoſe, that are doing what in them lies to hurry us into the moſt miſerable <hi>Anarchy</hi> and <hi>Confuſion.</hi>

            <p>Conſider how contrary to the <hi>Religion</hi> we all <hi>Profeſs</hi> ſuch <hi>Accurſed Practiſes</hi> are, and let us by all means avoid the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging any ſuch <hi>Deſigning</hi> and <hi>Reſtleſs Heads,</hi> as can never ſo much as pretend to protect our <hi>Religion,</hi> 'till they have firſt violated it, in the moſt neceſſary parts of it.

to our <hi>Prince,</hi> who will always value <hi>Loyal</hi> and <hi>Obedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> and <hi>Protect</hi> that <hi>Religion</hi> that teaches men to be ſo. <hi>Hereby</hi> we add a <hi>Luſtre</hi> to our <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> while we walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of that <hi>Holy Name that is named upon us.</hi> And render that and ourſelves truly Honourable to all <hi>Mankind,</hi> and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to thoſe that <hi>Govern</hi> us.
