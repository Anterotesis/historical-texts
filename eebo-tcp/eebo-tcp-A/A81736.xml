            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The dreadfull danger of SACRILEDGE held forth in this one Propoſition, namely</head>
            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>The with-holding of Tithes from a Miniſter that labours in the Word and Doctrine, or denying thoſe accuſtomed rates upon houſes, which have been paid to the Miniſters ſucceſſively time out of minde, is a great and grievous ſin, highly diſpleaſing to Almighty God, as appears by theſe Reaſons.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>1. <label>Reaſ.</label> 
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe it is a direct breach of the eighth Commandement, which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal;</hi> and directly contrary to the Rule of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 7. <hi>Render therefore to all their dues, Cuſtome to whom Cuſtome, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea <hi>Tithes</hi> are due to the Miniſter by the Law of the Land, and the Miniſter ha's as legal a right to the Rates ſet upon houſes, as the Landlord has to his Rent; Therefore to deprive the Miniſter of them, is a breach, not only of God's Law, but alſo of mans Law, and <hi>who ſo breaketh this hedge, a Serpent ſhall bite him,</hi> Eccleſ. 10. 8.</p>
            <p>
               <label>1. Object.</label> 
               <hi>But</hi> Tithes <hi>are Antichriſtian, and therefore not to be paid any longer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſwer.</label> This is a falſe opinion, as appears by this Argument: That which our Saviour enjoyned, is not Antichriſtian. But our Saviour enjoyned <hi>Tithes,</hi> Luke 11. 42. <hi>Ye tithe Mint and Rue, and all manner of Herbs, and paſſe over Iudgement and the Love of God, Theſe ought ye to have done;</hi> that is, ye ought to pay <hi>Tithes,</hi> Therefore they are not Antichriſtian.</p>
            <p>
               <label>2 Object.</label> 
               <hi>But we do not come to hear him, why then ſhould we pay him, ſince we have no benefit by his Miniſtery?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſw.</label> If thou live in a Pariſh where a godly Miniſter is ſeated, thou art bound to hear him, for he <hi>worketh the work of the Lord, as well as thoſe of greater parts,</hi> See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 10. If thou do not hear him, nor pay him, thou addeſt ſin to ſin; for, firſt it is a ſin to withdraw thy preſence, and then it is another, yea a greater ſin to withdraw his maintenance.</p>
            <p>
               <label>3. Object.</label> 
               <hi>But the Miniſter will not give us our Due in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, therefore we may juſtly deny him his due.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Sacrament is not due to all, but only to thoſe that come in a Regular way, according to the order of the Goſpel; for all things muſt be done decently and in order, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. Now the order of the Goſpel is this, That the power of examining thoſe that are admitted to the Lords Supper belongs not to the Miniſter alone, nor to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with the whole Congregation, but to the Miniſter and Ruling Elders as is undeniably proved by that ſingular Treatiſe ſet forth by the Provincial Aſſembly, called <hi>The Vindication of the Presbyterian Government,</hi> pag. 70, 71. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Sacrament is not due to thoſe that live in any ſcandalous ſin; But theft, or robbing of God is a ſcandalous ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <label>2. <hi>Reaſ.</hi>
               </label> It is a ſin of a high nature, becauſe it affronts God himſelf, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye ſay, wherein have we robbed thee? in Tithes and Offerings.</hi> To rob a man by the high-way, doth deſerve death: To rob a King of his Plate and Jewels, deſerves a tormenting death; but to rob the King of glory, deſerves the fire of hell.</p>
            <p>
               <label>3. <hi>Reaſ.</hi>
               </label> It is a complicated ſin, wherein fraud or cheating is added to Theft: for the Landlord lets his houſe to the Tenant at a lower rate, upon this account, namely, that he ſhall pay the duties to the Miniſter; as fore example, If the houſe be worth 21. l. <hi>per annum,</hi> The Landlord lets it for 20. l. <hi>per annum,</hi> on purpoſe that the Tenant may pay (perhaps) twenty ſhillings a yeer to the Miniſter. The Tenant notwithſtanding payes nothing, but keeps it back from the Miniſter by fraud, and puts the Landlords money in his own pocket. Here is fraud with a witneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <label>4. <hi>Reaſ.</hi>
               </label> It is a ſin, whereby godly Miniſters are diſcouraged in their work, their hands weakened, and their ſpirits broken, ſo that they cannot go on in their Miniſtery with <hi>Joy, but with grief;</hi> This is directly contrary to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of that godly King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> (whoſe example is written for our learning, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 4.) for it is teſtified of him, 2 <hi>Chron,</hi> 31. 4. <hi>That he commanded the people that dwelt in Ieruſalem, to give the portion of the Prieſts and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the Law of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>5. <hi>Reaſ.</hi>
               </label> It is a ſin, wherein and whereby the Defrauder robs his own ſoul of that ſpiritual benefit and advantage which he might get by ſuch a mans Miniſtery; for it is juſt with God to ſay to ſuch a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou withdraweſt mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from my ſervant, and I will withdraw my bleſſing from my own Ordinance, ſo that the Word preached (by whomſoever it be diſpenſed,) ſhall do thee no good at all, but rather it ſhall be <hi>a ſavour of death</hi> to thy own condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Thy ſoul ſhall never thrive or proſper by any Sermon that thou heareſt.</p>
            <p>
               <label>6. <hi>Reaſ.</hi>
               </label> It is a ſin that provokes God to curſe a man in his outward eſtate and trading, as appears by that forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med place, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Ye are curſed with a Curſe, for ye have robbed me;</hi> it is uſual with God to pay ſinners with their own coyn; They rob God in <hi>Tithes,</hi> and God robs them of their trade and livelihood; They grudge the Miniſters a maintenance, and God grudgeth them even bread for their families, ſo that they uſually turn bankrupts, or are ſo much in debt, that they are aſhamed to ſhew their faces.</p>
            <p>
               <label>7. <hi>Reaſ.</hi>
               </label> It is a ſin againſt the Goſpel, becauſe it hinders the progreſſe and ſucceſſe of it, for ſuch men do as much as in them lies to extinguiſh the light, by taking away the oyle that feeds it. It is obſerved in that excellent book. <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication Presb. Gov. pag.</hi> 81. that <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtate, that curſed enemy of Chriſt and his Goſpel, did by taking away <hi>Tithes</hi> do more miſchief to the Church of God, then all the perſecuting Emperours that were before him: for the Perſecutors took away only the Miniſters (and their blood was the ſeed of the Church) but taking away <hi>Tithes,</hi> took away the Miniſtery it ſelf.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> It is a ſin that will not be pardoned upon repentance, unleſſe there be a reſtitution as well as repentance, according to that of <hi>Auguſtine, Non remittitur peccatum, niſi reſtituatur ablatum,</hi> Thy ſin ſhall not be pardoned, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that which thou with-holdeſt unjuſtly, be reſtored.</p>
            <p>
               <label>9. <hi>Reaſ.</hi>
               </label> It is a ſin that will cry for vengeance, when the ſinner on his death-bed is crying for mercy; as appears by that remarkable Scripture, <hi>James</hi> 5. 3, 4. <hi>Your gold and ſilver is cankered, and the ruſt of them ſhall be a witneſſe againſt you, and ſhall eat your fleſh as it were with fire; Ye have heaped treaſure</hi> (that is, of wrath) <hi>together for the laſt dayes. Behold the hire of the Labourers which have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the cries of them which have reaped, are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath.</hi> Now if the hire of the Labourers in mens Vineyard, kept back by fraud, crieth; How dreadfull will the cry be of the hire of Gods Labourers in Gods Vineyard, kept back by robbers and defrauders? I tremble to think of it.</p>
            <p>Conſider what hath been preſented unto you in this paper, and the Lord give ye underſtanding in all things.</p>
