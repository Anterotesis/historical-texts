            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Iudicious Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE presume to present thee here with a Poem declaring the use and Noble Vertues of Archerie, which (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Modern Authors have or'e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look't the Theme, and forgotten to create Applauses equal to the Goodness and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Subject) is undoubtedly
<pb facs="tcp:99743:6"/>
worthy of a Noble Pen, and rather fit to be publish't and extoll'd by every one, than any way obscur'd by Oblivion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the multiplicity of Poems of natures farr different from this (and indeed farr different from any thing tending to the Nation's profit) still crouding into view, larded with bombast Notions, and stuff't with reiterated Hyperboles, or some more pitiful Passion, unfit to visit the World's light, much less the the Eyes of a Judicious Reader, hath emboldened us to present this Piece; which, however rudely compacted or dully rendred, is beautified with a Subject, that, maugre the barrenness of the Phrase, or the Envy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion or ill nature of a sort of Critical Detractors, that only find fault with things for want of better Imployment, will find favour with honour'd Patriots, whose care for their Country is equal to that of their
<pb facs="tcp:99743:6"/>
own safety, and whose Loyal Hearts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding in Vertue, cherish the Endeavours of those that imploy themselves on a Work that is not only laudable, but every way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial and profitable to our <hi>English</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p>Archerie (we mean) whose useful Art and Noble Science was approv'd and cherish't by our Fore-fathers as their <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Bonum,</hi> and whose Excellence is so renown'd, that 'tis supposed, any one that arrives to the understanding of his Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar has either read or heard of it: And those that have read of it, and do endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to practise it, will (we doubt not) honour our Endeavours with a favourable thought, it being an Art that we wish we had power or ability to improve, as well as to applaud: An Exercise in time of Peace fit to grace a Noble Spirit, and in Warr to oppose the worst of Dangers. The proof of whose Fame, and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:99743:7"/>
and Great Exploits atchieved by the power of the Bow, are so common and so often declared in all our Ancient Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, and other Histories, over most parts of the World, as well as in our Native Isle, that from us here it will prove ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a prolix Rehearsal, then an acute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of what has been so universally famous.</p>
            <p>Yet as Rust by degrees penetrates our hardest Mettals, and Oblivion of a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Art proves not only obstructive to a particular Person, but to the Nation in general; we have endeavour'd to refresh the Memory of this forgetful Age, and emboldned by the Loyalty and Zeal we bear to our Soveraign and Country, have presumed to declare, That the want of this Noble Science hath weakned our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and what would prove Invincible, if joyn'd and commixt with our present Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,
<pb facs="tcp:99743:7"/>
proveth now not only void of that Success, but incapable of that Fame and Glory it might atchieve, if assisted by this brave and magnanimous Exercise of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps that understand it not will be apt to term it a dull and laborious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime, and more fit for the capacity and natural strength of a Peasant, than to be a Recreation for a Gentleman. But did they understand the true worth of this Noble Exercise, whose use and vertue has in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine Ages been sought and cherish't by Princes, and acknowledg'd by the Learned and Judicious to be not only a Sport fit for the brawny Commonalty, but the generous Nobility, the Excellency of whose Nature is such, that it banishes growing Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers from the Bodies of such whose destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Idleness nourish their Diseases, and increases Health, begets Strength, and infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb facs="tcp:99743:8"/>
Courage into the Breasts of all worthy Practitioners of this Science: Then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly those that through Ignorance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved it, will with shame confess their causeless Detraction, and convert their critical Intentions into real Applauses. Nor is it our design to molest or displease any one, but to content and please every one, our chief intent being to publish the Vertues of this Noble Science in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to incite our generous Country-men to further and approve of what will be not only fit, noble, and successful, to be used in War, but pleasant and commodious in times of Peace, whose power we doubt not but, if rais'd and exercis'd successfully, will be a main Prop to support the Basis of this Kingdom, and a secure Guard against ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Dangers.</p>
            <p>Let those whose Incredulity, as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to our present Endeavours, are so farr
<pb facs="tcp:99743:8"/>
from believing the Vertues of this Art, that they malitiously condemn it, spend an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon in perusing the Chronicles of our Nations atchievements by this Weapon, and the History of the Warrs of the <hi>Romans, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, Scythians, Parthians, Grecians,</hi> and many other Warlike Nations, whose greatest Strength lay in their Bows and Shafts, whose noble and dangerous Enterprises and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have been often declar'd and publisht by several worthy and Judicious Authors, not difficult to be found of any Inquisitor, and then their Judgments (refin'd by so many <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nfallible Proofs of the ancient Excellency of this Art) will, we doubt not, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the malignity of their Inclinations, and the unparallel'd worth and vertue of our present Theme. As for others, whose <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gnorance of its worth, and whose illiterate Capacities are so irreparably dull, that the Proof by History is farr above the reach of
<pb facs="tcp:99743:9"/>
their groveling Understanding, we shall unconcern'd sustain their harmless Censures, and rather pity their Imperfections, than blame their Licentious Tongues for want of Judgment.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as our present Design is Loyal and Vertuous, 'tis our hope the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess will be favourable and prosperous: And we doubt not, but there are some wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Spirits in this Kingdom, whose love to this Heroick Exercise, and whose Loyalty and Faith to their King and Country will by their Actions express their Care and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, and by their Endeavours be a means to plant this wholsome, noble, and warlike Science in this Realm: The fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering and approving of which will be the greatest content that can arrive to us, whose Hopes, as well as Wishes, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to see the Art of Shooting prosper, and whose Abilities, were they equal to our
<pb facs="tcp:99743:9"/>
Endeavours, should be the first to lay a Foundation, whereon the noble Structure of this Excellent Science should be built; but since Fortune hath dealt unkindly with us in depriving us of that Power, we hope it will be worthy of the General Care, whose sufficiency is farr more capable of the performance, than any Particular Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: The pursuance of which, and the happy Success of our present Endeavours, will not only bring us a particular content and happiness, but be a benefit fit to be chronicled by our Natives, and admired by succeeding Ages.</p>

            <p>HAving spoken so liberally in the Applause of this Noble Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise in the precedent Poem, perhaps it will be expected that we should instruct Persons in the Practick Part of it, as well as delight them with the Theorick. And though 'tis confest there
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99743:44"/>
is a large portion of Skill to be used in the exact managing of this Weapon; yet it is sooner to be learnt by Ocular Observance and daily Practice, than by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal Demonstration, Affection to it, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten endeavouring to do like those that are Masters of this Science, being a greater and readier means to make any One perfect, than the Description of it by the Pen can be. Yet, to let the Ingenious perceive we are not Ignorant of the Use and Nature of that Science which we so much applaud, and which is indeed so worthy to be applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we have inserted these following Rules, thereby briefly relating the Implements, and the Knowledge that an Archer must be possest of, before he can attain to a perfect form of Shooting.</p>
            <p>First, I shall have relation to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements that are necessary, and to be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99743:44"/>
us'd by all Archers, which are these;
<list>
                  <item>A Bracer,</item>
                  <item>A Shooting Glove,</item>
                  <item>A String,</item>
                  <item>A Bow,</item>
                  <item>A Shaft,</item>
                  <item>A Bow-Case, and</item>
                  <item>A Pouch.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The Bracer, although first mentioned, is of no great use, except to some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whose Cloaths hinder the passage of the String; or such whose Bows are not bent accordingly. It is commonly used for these two Causes: First, to keep the Arm or Wrist from being hurt by the String, and the sleeve from being dammag'd. And secondly, that by gliding or slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping quickly off the Bracer, the Shaft
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:99743:45"/>
may have the more vigour to perform your will; for, wanting this Bracer, if the String should light upon your Sleeve it would hinder the force of the Shoot, and so cause you to miss of your intended purpose.</p>
            <p>A Shooting Glove is only us'd to save a man's fingers from hurting, that he may be able to draw the String to the utmost of his strength; and therefore his Glove must be lined at the fingers with thick Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, fit for that purpose.</p>
            <p>A String of a Bow, though little in it self, ought to be much regarded, for great Judgment is required in choosing of good Strings: for an ill String break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth many a good Bow. They have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, as many <hi>Greek</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Fav<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
               </note> Authors write, been made diversly; as of Flax, of Silk,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99743:45"/>
of Hair; but in our last Age new Hemp was thought best for a String. In string<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Bow there must be great care ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that the String be not too short, nor too long, but equal to the length and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Bow: and take heed the Bow be well Nock't, lest the sharpness of the Horn, by wearing the String out, indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger your Bow: For if the String begin to fret or wear, trust it not, but take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for you had better lose a String than a Bow.</p>
            <p>As to the Bow, the Ancients used to make them diversly; as of Brass, Iron, Steel. <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Hiad.</hi> 4</note> 
               <hi>Pandarus,</hi> the best and most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Archer amongst the <hi>Trojans</hi> (as <hi>Homer</hi> writes) had his Bow made of two Goat's-horns joyned together, which was proved to be of great power. <hi>Herodotus</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>In Thalia</hi>
               </note> writes that the <hi>Indians</hi> used to make Bows
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99743:46"/>
of a certain Reed; and several others have used <hi>Brasile, Elme, Wych, Ash,</hi> all which are very unfit to be used in this Age if considered rightly, <hi>Yew</hi> being most sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table now to our strength and abilities. And indeed it is of that excellent Nature, that nothing can excel it, in making a good, quick, and well tempered Bow.</p>
            <p>A Shaft must be made according to your Bow, and equally weighed: ill Shafts oft make an ill Archer. Therefore there ought some Judgment and Care to be used in having your Shafts made by some skilful Fletcher, that can both see a defect and mend it.</p>
            <p>A Bow-case is to preserve a Bow from the Weather, and it ought not to be too wide or too narrow, but indifferent. A
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99743:46"/>
Bow-case of Leather is not good by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of its dampness; Woollen being most fit for that use, by reason of its warmth. If you keep Bows at your House, a Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Wood is good to preserve them in; but take heed it stand not too near a Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, for the moisture of that will make your Bows weak; nor too near a Fire, lest the heat make them brittle.</p>
            <p>A Pouch serveth only to contain ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries, as your Glove, Bracer, Silk for your String, and wax to rub it with. And though a man may shoot without it, yet a good Archer will find it necessary.</p>
            <p>Next, in breaking a Bow there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wayes; either by the String, by the Shaft drawing too farr, or by frets; if the String be either too short or too long, not well put on, or dammag'd, the Bow
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:99743:47"/>
being ill Nockt, or being too old. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Archer should take a great deal of care in keeping all things fit, that his good Bow may not be in danger.</p>
            <p>These are the Implements generally used in shooting: But now we shall say something relating to their use and management; <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>Standing,</item>
               <item>Nocking,</item>
               <item>Drawing,</item>
               <item>Holding,</item>
               <item>Loosing.</item>
            </list>
            <p>First, when an Archer is about to shoot, he should alwayes be sure to take such footing or standing as shall be both graceful to the Eyes of Spectators, and profitable for his own use, framing his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99743:47"/>
Countenance and his other parts so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, that all his strength may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to his advantage, and other mens delight. He must not bee too hasty, nor too tedious in taking Aim; for the one will be accounted Temerity, the other an affected Curiosity. His Body must be streight, his Legs not stradling, nor too farr distant, but in such a Posture as may declare to the stander by his Judgment, by his deportment and management of his Weapon.</p>
            <p>To nock your Shaft well is easily done if any care be taken; the only diligence being in placing your Shaft well and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually cross your Bow: for unconstant nocking makes a man often miss of his Aim, and sometimes maketh the Bow to be in danger of breaking, for if nockt too high or too low, the Shaft, if it be
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99743:48"/>
little, will start; if great, hobble. Alwayes nock the Cock-feather of your Arrow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost, and take heed the String slip not out of the Nock, for then all is in danger of breaking.</p>
            <p>To draw a Bow well is the best and most graceful part of shooting. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients used to draw their Bow to their Breasts, as <hi>Homer</hi> demonstrates in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of <hi>Pandarus</hi> shooting:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iliad.</hi> 4.</note>Vp to his Pap the String he did pull, his Shaft to the hard Iron—</l>
               </q>
The Warlike Women of <hi>Scythia</hi> used also the same manner of shooting low at the Breast: and for that reason in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, <hi>Penthesilea</hi> caused the right Paps of her <hi>Amazons</hi> to be feared away. But this manner of shooting is not used now; the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99743:48"/>
drawing to the right Ear being certainly the best and most graceful way: for a man hath not only freedom to use all his strength, and aim right, but it is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture so comly and graceful, that it will exceedingly delight the Spectators.</p>
            <p>You must not hold your Bow too long when it is drawn; for if it be not of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding good temper it will break: The performance of this can better be imagin'd then describ'd; only there must be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual measure of Time between drawing and holding, or else 'tis ten to one but your shot is spoil'd.</p>
            <p>Loosing is much of the same nature; it must be quick and hard that it may be without girds: and take heed of letting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of your Cloaths touch the String. <hi>Leo</hi> the Emperour would have his Souldiers
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99743:49"/>
heads polled, and the beards shaved, for fear lest the hair of their Heads should hinder their Aspect, or their Beards ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the force of the String. These Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts truly observ'd and follow'd, will doubtless instruct a Lover of this Art in its greatest mystery.</p>
            <p>Two other things there are which are general to all Archers; which is
<list>
                  <item>Weather, and</item>
                  <item>Mark.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Of the Weather as thus: He must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how the Wind is, whether with him, against him, side-wind, full side-wind, fide-wind quarter with him, side-wind quarter against him, or the like, that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99743:49"/>
thereby he may shoot freely without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all obstructed by the badness of the Weather. Frost is the only Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to a Bow, for without good rubbing and care it will be apt to grow brittle and break.</p>
            <p>In shooting at a Mark observe this, to fix your standing, to shoot compass, to draw alwayes alike, to nock even, and to loose alwayes alike. Then to consider the nature of the Prick on Hills, in Valleys, streight Plains, or winding Places, and to keep a just De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum equal to the length or shortness of the Mark.</p>
            <p>This heedfully understood and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, will I doubt not instruct a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginner how to shoot, especially being daily taught by seeing the practice of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99743:50"/>
others skilful in this Art, whose worth I hope will finish the Documents I have here epitomiz'd, and make the Practiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner's Knowledge equal to our Hopes and wishes.</p>

            <head>Orders and Observations touching the Noble Exercise of <hi>Shooting</hi> in the <hi>Long-Bow,</hi> to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by those which practise that Noble Art.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>INprimis,</hi> For the finding of your Mark, it must be within every man's reach, and truly named, for prevention of cavil.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For Whites, you may have as many as you please, so that they be all forwards: and if a loose White be sticken out of sight, it is no Mark.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For the highest Stakes, if there be a Pin, you must measure to it, though the wood be higher, for the Pin was put in for that purpose.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If you shoot at a Bush, or Black, or whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver else, you are to take the highest part thereof, for your place to measure at.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For all Trees, you are to measure at Foot and Pole, except in the naming of it you say, At the Nayl, or, At the Hole, in such a Tree: or if you can reach the top with half your Bow, then you are to take the highest to measure at; but for Foot and Pole, you must measure a foot above the highest ground which joyns to the Tree.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If in measuring a Shoot, the difference be so
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99743:51"/>
small that it cannot be decided, then that Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titor shall win the Shoot, which is best at the next Mark.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If in measuring a Shoot, the Mark be stirred out of its place, he loseth the Shoot that removed it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If at first coming to your Mark you claim two or more, and the opposite side draw their Arrows, you can have no more than you first claimed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though your Partner when he comes challengeth more.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If you name one Mark, and Shoot at another, you are to lose your Shoot, and the other are to follow at the Mark named.</p>
            <p n="10">10. If your Arrow break, you may measure to the nearest piece which hath wood and head, or wood and feather.</p>
            <p n="11">11. If you have any mishap, as in nocking amiss, &amp;c. if you can reach your Arrow with your Bow, you may shoot again; if it flie further, it is a Shoot.</p>
            <p n="12">12. In shooting at Rovers, you must stand no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from your Mark than you can reach with half your Bow; but at Pricks you are permitted to stand two Bows before your Mark, and as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it as you please.</p>

            <l>WHen <hi>English Archers</hi> first in Warr's appear'd,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>England</hi> was honor'd; Honor'd? nay, 'twas fear'd:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Iows</hi> still claim credit, and first merited <hi>fame,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>When great Duke <hi>Will.</hi> that <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueror came:</l>
            <l>With him came <hi>Bows</hi>; and since, with warlike chance,</l>
            <l>Prov'd terrible <hi>weapons</hi> still, 'gainst Foes in <hi>France:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Witness those Battels (where we <hi>Laurel</hi> wore)</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Cressie, Poitiers,</hi> strong <hi>Agen,</hi> many more;</l>
            <l>In which, by valour of our <hi>Archers</hi> stout,</l>
            <l>Some slain, some ta'ne, but ALL were put to rout:</l>

            <l>Then came that thwick-thwack thundring Instrument,</l>
            <l>First hatch't in Hell, and from the Devil sent;</l>
            <l>In all which time, what Battels have we won,</l>
            <l>Since we laid by our <hi>Bow,</hi> to bounse a Gun?</l>
            <l>Tell but one brave Battel ever fought,</l>
            <l>And won (since then) if not, account them nought:</l>
            <l>And, like brave <hi>English Archers,</hi> still extoll the <hi>Bow,</hi>
