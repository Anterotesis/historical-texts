            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IN the Buſineſs in Agitation touching Inrolling of Deeds, Theſe things conſiderable.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Miſchief propounded, to be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died.</item>
               <item>2. The Remedy to be applyed.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The Miſchiefs at preſent to be remedied are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The great Deceit committed by Perſons by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Judgments, Mortgages, Conveyances, and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements; whereby Purchaſers are oftentimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and Creditors defeated. And this the more conſiderable in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe indeed the great Inland-Trade we have, is the Trade of Buying and Selling of Lands, and the great Security that is ordinarily given to Creditors and Lenders of Money is by Security of Land.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Multitude of chargeable and difficult Suits in Law, occaſioned by Preconveyances, ſecret Mortgages and other Incumbrances, which proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52164:3"/>
would be avoided and leſſened, if all Mens E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates lay open to the View of others.</p>
            <p>The Remedy propounded is, by an Office of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollment, or Regiſtry of Conveyances.</p>
            <p>In this, as in all other Applications of Remedies to any Miſchiefs, theſe things muſt be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How and by what means the Remedy may be commenſurate to the Miſchief?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether the Remedy or the Application there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in ſuch manner as it may be commenſurate to the Miſchief, be feaſible or not?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Admit it be, Then what Inconveniencies may otherwiſe be introduced by the Application of the Remedy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the Inconveniencies introduced by it be greater than the Benefit it gives, the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is to rejected.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It the Inconveniencies thereby occaſioned be over-weighed by the Benefit, Then it may be Entertained.</p>
            <p>But with due Conſideration or Proviſion that thoſe Inconveniencies introduced by the Remedy, may with as much Prudence as may be, be obviated, prevented, removed, or very much allayed by ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Proviſions againſt them.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe Conſiderations, namely the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Remedy in a due Commenſurateneſs, to the Miſchief, muſt needs be by taking Care that there be no Room or Inlet for any ſuch Deceit by ſecret Conveyances or Incumbrances of Eſtates: <hi>For if any one Leak be left unſtopt, the Veſſel will ſink as well as if more were open.</hi> And if any one Device be left unprovided for, thither will fraudulent Perſons
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52164:3"/>
betake themſelves, and get out of the Remedy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>Therefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. All Judgments, Statutes, and Recognizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, muſt lye open to view, either by Inrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or Regiſtring them, becauſe thoſe charge Lands.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All Truſts touching Eſtates muſt be Inrolled or Regiſtred,<note place="margin">Truſts.</note> for now by the Power of Courts of Equity, theſe do charge Lands, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the hands of the Fourth or Fifth Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſor, if there be proof of notice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All Mortgages, as well forfeited as not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, Defeazances in Nature of Mortgages, muſt be Inrolled.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All Powers of Revocation and limitting of new Uſes, Powers of Letting or Charging Eſtates, muſt be Regiſtred or Inrolled; for theſe may alter the Title of Lands, and are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times contained in diſtinct Deeds, from the Deed whereby the Eſtate is ſetled.</p>
            <p n="5">5. All Declarations of Uſes and Truſts upon Fines, Recoveries, and other Aſſurances.</p>
            <p n="6">6. All Grants of Rents, Commons, Profits, all Conditions and Reſervations of Rents.</p>
            <p n="7">7. All Leaſes, for Years or Lives, made by any Perſon either with Rent, or without it.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52164:4"/>8. In brief, All Feoffments, Grants, Releaſes, Confirmations, Wills, Forfeitures, Eſcheats, Commons, or whatſoever other Eſtate or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in them.</p>
            <p>For if any of theſe be not Inrolled or Regiſtred, or ſome way rendred open to the view of every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a Man may be cheated or deceived. And what is odds, whether a Man be deceived by a ſecret Mortgage or Judgment? or by a ſecret Leaſe for Lives or Years, or by a ſecret Settlement, or Deviſe or Will? And all theſe muſt be ſecret to him that hath no ready means to diſcover them: The Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whereof is deſigned in this publick Regiſtry.</p>
            <p>And yet further, If the Remedy be intended as large as the Diſeaſe, this Regiſtry muſt not only look forward, but it muſt look backward, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That all Eſtates and Incumbrances now in Being, as well as thoſe that ſhall be hereafter, muſt be laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the View, otherewiſe the Proviſion is not commenſurate, there being in all probability a Stock of latent Incumbrances and Charges upon Lands, which may ſerve at leaſt to deceive and cheat this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age, and the next alſo. Therefore unleſs there be ſome Notification of preſent Incumbrances as well as future, we but lay up a Security, that it may be of uſe an Hundred Years hence, and leave the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and intervening Ages in as bad, if not worſe Condition, than we find them.</p>
            <p>Therefore a Remedy commenſurate to the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief muſt needs provide for the Regiſtring all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52164:4"/>
and Intereſts, and Charges of Lands, and that as well for the time paſt, as time to come; otherwiſe the Plaiſter is too narrow for the Sore.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Conſideration is, Whether this be poſſible to be done? Indeed it is a fine thing in the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory and Speculation, and a Man that fixeth his Thoughts upon the good that might come by ſuch an Expedient, without troubling himſelf with the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that lie in the way to it, may drive it on very earneſtly; but he that ſhall conſider the Difficulty of it, will eaſily ſee that it is but a Notion and Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and cannot be effected or reduced into practice, at leaſt not without immenſe Confuſion.</p>
            <p>The Difficulties that attend this Deſign, are either ſuch as relate to the Inrolling of Eſtates now in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or ſecondly, The Inrolling of Eſtates hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to made or granted; or Thirdly, Such Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as relate to both.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Difficulties that attend the Inrolling of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates now in Being, or paſt, theſe ſeem inſuperable. In order to the diſcovery hereof, we muſt ſuppoſe,<note place="margin">Liberty. Penalty.</note> that either every Man ſhall be at Liberty to Inroll or Regiſter his Eſtate, or it muſt be under this Penalty, that if he fail herein, he muſt loſe his Eſtate. If we ſuppoſe the former, then every Man is ſtill at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as he was before, and nothing is effected by it.</p>
            <p>If the Latter, <hi>(viz)</hi> That he ſhall loſe if he do not Inroll the Eſtate he hath, or which is all one, it ſhall be in the power of him that Inrolls a Subſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52164:5"/>
Title to make the former, not Inrolled, void; Then either that Inrollment or Regiſtry muſt be barely of his Claim, or ſome Abſtract of his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; or he muſt Inroll the Tenor of the Deed, or Evidence by which he Claims.</p>
            <p>If we ſhall ſuppoſe the former, then theſe things will be Conſiderable. <hi>Firſt,</hi> What if he doth in ſome things miſtake his Claim?<note place="margin">Miſtakes.</note> It may be, he thinks he has an Eſtate in Fee-Simple, when it is but in Tail, It may be an Eſtate Abſolute, when it is Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;<note place="margin">Abſtracts.</note> Certainly he that Claims by an Abſtract, had need of a very good Counſel at his Elbow, to give him ſound and uncontroulable Advice, in drawing it up; otherwiſe he that hath a good Title may loſe it for want of a right Abſtract of his Title by which he Claims. Surely therefore every Man that hath a good Title, and can poſſibly come by the Deed or Evidence by which he Claims it, will Inroll his Deed at large,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rge.</note> for fear he ſhould omit any thing eſſential to his Title. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Or elſe it is intended, that though he miſtake his Title, yet if he enter as much as he thinks fit, it ſhall be ſufficient to preſerve his Eſtate. And if this be intended, the whole deſign of Regiſtring and Inrolling will End in a publick Deceit and Inſecurity, when perchance in the Event, the Eſtate or Intereſt Claimed, doth materially and ſubſtantially vary from what is Regiſtred.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ed.</note> 
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Again, if ſuch an uncertain Claim ſhall be allowed, not made good by Deeds or Evidences, this Office will breed more Diſturbance in many Eſtates, than any imaginable Deceits or Frauds beſides can equal: For any Man ſhall at a venture make what Claims, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52164:5"/>
ſet up what Pretences he pleaſes to any Mans E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in <hi>England,</hi> and ſhall be admitted to Enrol them in the Regiſtry, and the Perſon injured ſhall be either remedileſs, or driven to more Suits and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, to vindicate his Title,<note place="margin">Suits increa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed.</note> than now he is neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated unto, to diſcover a Fraud in a Seller.</p>
            <p>It remains therefore neceſſary, that whoſoever will Inrole any thing in being, he muſt produce ſome Authentick Deed, or other Record, to warrant what he would have Inrolled, and then there muſt be Inrolled at leaſt ſo much of the Deed, or Evidence that concerns, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Parties, Grantor and Grantee. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The things Granted. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Eſtate Granted. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> All thoſe parts of the Deed, or Evidence, that have any Influence upon the Eſtate: as Rent reſerved, Conditions, Powers of Revocation, of Alteration, of Leaſing, the Truſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thoſe other things that have an Influence upon the Eſtate; and without all this done and truly done, the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer or Lender, is as much in the Dark as before, and Cheated under the Credit of a Publick Office Erected to prevent it.</p>
            <p>This being the State of the Buſineſs in relation to Inrolling of things paſt; there follows next, thoſe Difficulties that render the Deſign either Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or Fruitleſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Many Perſons that have Titles, have them by Livery without Deed, or cannot bring the Deed to the Office to be Regiſtred, or Inrolled, becauſe the Deed it ſelf is not, nor by Law cannot be in their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52164:6"/>

            <p>If (44. <hi>Eliz.) A.</hi> Conveyed his Land to <hi>B.</hi> and 12. <hi>Ja.</hi> 1. <hi>B.</hi> Conveyed it to <hi>C.</hi> and 3. <hi>Car.</hi> 1. <hi>C.</hi> conveyed it to <hi>D.</hi> and 20. <hi>Ca.</hi> 2. <hi>D.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed it to E. muſt all theſe Conveyances be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled or only the laſt? If all muſt be Inrolled, then if any one Mans Conveyance be omitted, ſuppoſe it from <hi>A.</hi> to B. then the omiſſion of the Inrollment thereof, will give a Title to <hi>A.</hi> or his Heir, to make a Claim to this Land,<note place="margin">Mean Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances.</note> if only that from the laſt Seller, then is the Purchaſer in the Dark ſtill, what Eſtates were in the antecedent Owners, and how Derived, and ſo the Deſign ineffectual to the end propoſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If all the mean Conveyances of Mens Eſtate, ſhould be Inrolled, <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> would not hold the Inrollments, and the Charge thereof would be above two Millions of Money; nay, if we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the preſent Eſtates of the preſent Owners of Lands in any one conſiderable County, were to be Inrolled, the Charge would be intollerable, and the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52164:6"/>
Bulk it ſelf would be utterly uſeleſs: Suppoſe in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> 20000. Houſes, and each Houſe to have but two Titles, that is, that of the Owners of the Inheritance, and that of the preſent Leſſee, (tho' ſome have many more concurrent and coincident Titles to recompence thoſe that may have poſſibly leſs) this would bring to the Inrollment Office 40000. Deeds, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollment of every Deed at leaſt 10 s. would produce 20000 Pound and about 200. Volumes of Velum Books, which would take up the Imployment of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Clerks, and when the work was done, the Volumes too vaſt and numerous to be made uſe of; and what would be done then with the many Leaſes of Weſtern Mannors, which yet have many under Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles derived under them?</p>
            <p n="4">4. But how ſhall theſe Deeds come to be Inrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? he that made them perchance is Dead, or at leſt will not come to acknowledge it, and if every Man that brings a Deed ſhould have it Inrolled without acknowledging it by him that made it, any forged Deed may be Inrolled, and Men in a little while, may loſe their Eſtates, by the Countenance that a forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Deed ſhall receive, by being Inrolled among the publick Records of the Office; for the Officer can never examine the Truth or Reality of the Deed, or if he could, it would not be reaſonable that Mens Eſtates ſhould depend upon the Judgment of any Ignorant Clerk, or Officer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for the Inrollment of all Conveyances and Deeds for the time to come, this labours under great Difficulties alſo, though not ſo many and ſo
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52164:7"/>
great, as the Inrollment of things paſt; becauſe here the Perſons that make the Deeds may poſſibly come to acknowledge them before ſome Perſons publickly intruſted,<note place="margin">Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> as two Juſtices of the Peace, or the Maſter of the Office; yet this has alſo great Difficulties.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Many Mens Eſtates are by Will, where the Proprietors of the Eſtates have not the Cuſtody of the Will to produce.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How ſhall the Officer before whom the Will is produced,<note place="margin">Wills.</note> if it be produced, know whether the Will be true or forced, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked? ſince the Deviſor is now Dead, that made it; and ſurely it can't be intended that every Man that makes his Will of Land ſhall Inroll it in his Life-time, ſince he may often change, revoke, and alter it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Although it is a very great Inconvenience and fit to be remedied by Act of Parliament, that many times in Courts of Equity, Truſts are averred without and contrary to Deed, yet certainly ſo long as that Uſage is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">Truſts.</note> all Truſts of Eſtates cannot be Inrolled becauſe they be oftentimes in Averment and Proof without Writing, and ſo do often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the uſes of Fines,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Act of Fraud and Perjuries.</note> which as yet have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into the Eſtates of moſt Men, and yet as the Law now ſtands are averrable without Deed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Charge of Inrollment of all Incumbrances and Eſtates of Land, even for the future will,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52164:7"/>
in the ſpace of few Years, grow vaſt, and the Regiſtry or Inrollment-Office will grow ſo Voluminary in ſeven or eight years in moſt Countries, that they will become uſeleſs and unmanageable to the Ends pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, as would eaſily appear upon a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> or Eſtimate of the Eſtates, Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Leaſes, Judgments, and other Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances that grow up in one County, in one Year.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe Difficulties that are common both to Inrollment of things paſt, and to come, are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Place where this Regiſtry ſhall be kept,<note place="margin">Ubi.</note> if in <hi>London;</hi> all Men muſt come up thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Inroll their Deeds, which will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable: If in the Countries where the Lands lye, then <hi>London</hi> being the Great Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Buying and Selling, a Man that deals here at <hi>London,</hi> muſt be forced to ſend into <hi>Cornwall</hi> or <hi>Northamberland,</hi> to ſearch the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtry there.</p>
            <p>Again, What ſhall be done,<note place="margin">Several Counties.</note> where one Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance comprizeth Lands in ſeveral Counties? or where a Man, having Lands in ſeveral Countries, Acknowledgeth a Judgment or Statute, ſhall this be Regiſtred in every County? And if it ſhall, how ſhall the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners know all the Counties where his Land lieth? and how ſhall the Deed in one
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52164:8"/>
County be tranſmitt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed to another, or muſt it be acknowledged in every ſeveral County, and by the Party there Inrolled?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">Judgments. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>2. Again, How ſhall Judgments that Charge Lands or Statutes, Merchant, or the Staple, be authentickly Regiſtred in every County? and what Warrant ſhall be ſufficient for it, eſpecially ſince there be ſo many Courts of Record in <hi>England,</hi> wherein Judgments giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, will charge Lands in other Counties, as in the Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the Courts of Grand-Seſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that as to Eſtates and Incumbrances already before this time created, the propounded Regiſter ſeems utterly impoſſible and unpractical: As to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and Incumbrances for the time to come, tho' more practical, yet very difficult, cumberſome and chargeable, and ſcarce applicable to the End deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">Compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> if it be compulſary upon all to do it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to the Inconveniencies, I ſhall mention ſome, and of thoſe, ſome applicable to both Propoſals, both of Regiſtring things paſt, and to come, tho' far greater in relation to the time paſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whereas many Men perchance, for many years have quietly enjoyed their Eſtates; although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance ſome little Defects there might be in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, as for want of ſome Ceremonies, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances or Words: Now by Inrolling of theſe Deeds,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52164:8"/>
all theſe Defects will be expoſed to the View, Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Search, and Diſcovery of others; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by buſie Projectors will be picking holes in the Titles and Eſtates of many Men, which are now quiet and at reſt. This will diſcover the Flaws and Defects of all Mens Aſſurances,<note place="margin">Suite; mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied.</note> and multiply Suits and Queſtions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas it many times moves great Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in Families, when Children ſhall ſee and know how their Parents diſpoſe their Eſtates among them in their Life-time. This Courſe will force the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Enroll all his Settlements, whereby all his Intentions will be diſcovered in his Life-time, which may breed great Unquietneſs and Animoſity; or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, it will put it in the Power of the Heir if the Deed be not Inrolled, to ſell the Land, and ſo defeat all his younger Brothers and Siſters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whereas ſome are deſirous that the Greatneſs of their Eſtates may not be known, to expoſe them to Envy and Detraction; Others are deſirous that the Weakneſs of their Eſtates may not be known; to expoſe them to Contempt or Queſtion. This Regiſtring of Men's Eſtates and Intereſts, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points both, even where there is no occaſion for a Purchaſor to be concerned, nor any Deſign of Fraud in either.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is worth Enquiry, whether the Proſpect of this Buſineſs is not ſo much to remedy old In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, as to introduce new, by Erection of new Offices and new Officers, Salaries, Fees, which

            </list>
            <p>It is true, That if all Conveyances of Lands were for the time to come Regiſtred, it would in proceſs of time do much good, and prevent many Suits and Frauds, tho' perchance the preſent Age may not find the Advantage of it. And certainly,<note place="margin">27. <hi>H.</hi> 8.</note> it was the great Deſign of the Statute of the 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. of Inrollments to have brought up that Method of Aſſurances, and had it been purſued, it had before this time been brought to great Perfection, and done much of that Good which is now intended by it.</p>
            <p>But to make the Deſign at this day Practical and Uſeful, theſe things muſt be obſerved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reference to Deeds of all ſorts.</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:52164:10"/>1. Therefore in relation to Deeds, theſe things are neceſſary to make the Deſign Practical and Uſeful.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it be Enacted that no Eſtate paſs from Man to Man (by Act executed in Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,<note place="margin">Act of Frauds.</note> other than by laſt Will) for above Years, without Deed</p>
            <p n="2">2. That no Uſe or Truſt of any Eſtate be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but by Deed expreſſing the ſame.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That to prevent the extream length of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants in Deeds, there be thought of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Words that may carry in them the Strength of Covenants or Warranty's; As for Inſtance, [<hi>Dedi,</hi> or <hi>Give,</hi>] to include a Warranty and Covenant againſt all Men, and alſo for further Aſſurance,<note place="margin">Words to mean more.</note>

            <p>It is True, That by thoſe Advantages, and ſome others that may be added, moſt of the Aſſurances in <hi>England</hi> will run this way; and thereby,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Offices of Clerks of the Peace, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollments in Chancery, will grow to be great and beneficial Offices.</p>

               <item>3. The Loſs of Fines, and Poſt-Fines, may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly recompenced by a very ſmall Allowance upon every Deed inrolled; and yet the Subject be a Gainer by it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And as theſe ſmall Difficulties may be eaſily recovered, ſo theſe great Conveniencies would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52164:12"/>1. No Man would be compelled to Inroll his Deeds, and yet every Man might take the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it that pleaſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The old Courſe of Fines and Recoveries, not taken away, but left for every Man to uſe that would, though a cheaper and readier Courſe of Aſſurances be ſubſtituted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whereas now no Fine, or Recovery can be had in Vacation time, whereby many Men,<note place="margin">Vacation time.</note> before they can ſettle their Lands by this means, Entailes and Feme Coverts may be barred, and ſettle their Eſtates as they have occaſion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It would take away the Charges of Travel to <hi>London,</hi> by Perſons living remote; the Charges of Commiſſions, <hi>Dedimus poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> Warrants of Attorney, and all thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident Charges of Fines and Recoveries: So that a Man that is neceſſitated to ſell his Land, though it be but an Acre, cannot do it, by Fine or Recovery, under Fifty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, may be able, by this means,<note place="margin">Cheapneſs.</note> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his Aſſurance for Ten Shillings.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It will, in few Years, carry the whole Track and Current of Aſſurances in a way that may be open to all Men, and yet without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion to any.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52164:13"/>6. It will prevent thoſe many Defects in Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances by Fines and Recovery; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſo many Parts, and paſſing through ſo many Hands, are ſubject oftentimes to be Reverſed: It may be, for the Loſs or Miſtake of an Original Writ, or ſome Defect. And thus far for Inrolling of Deeds.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>27.</hi> Eliz.</note>2 Touching Judgments and Statutes. The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 27. <hi>Eliz.</hi> hath provided in a good Meaſure for the Inrolling of Statutes: But as for Judgments it is a Buſineſs of great difficulty how to Inroll them eſpecially becauſe it cannot.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Be readily known where the Party lives, or where his Land lies by the Miniſters of that Court where the Judgment is given, and ſo it will be difficult to tranſmit the ſame into the Countries where the Land lies.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If that were all known, yet it might be hard that a Copy of a Judgment, in Paper, ſhould be a ſufficient Warrant to enter it with the Clerk of the Peace in the County.</p>
            <p>But all the way that ſeems to be practical in this kind, were for the Clerks of the ſeveral great Courts, to extract out of the Rolls, the Abſtracts of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizances and Judgments, for four or five Years paſt, or more; and alſo for the time to come, as they are entred, and to digeſt them in Alphabet, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Surname of him that acknowledgeth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52164:13"/>
them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo to preſerve them for publick Inſpection, this might be eaſily done, and a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary or Fee ſetled by Act of Parliament for the reſpective Offices employed therein. Only there are theſe Inconveniences which muſt be remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Retroſpect of a Judgment to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a Term, though acknowledged, it may be, long after.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The late Inrollment of Judgments confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo that there is little appears of Record, but only in private Remembrancers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The keeping of Paper Recognizances ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in Courts for many Days and ſome Months, without Inrolling them as they ought, and yet by relation to the time of the Caption, many times over-reach Men's Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes and Securities: Theſe might be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died by the Orders of ſeveral Courts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Act of Parliament, if ſtrictly enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and obſerved, though a ſhort Act would eaſily make the Remedy univerſal.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>And lastly,</hi> Touching Wills, the Difficulty will be very great to put them into better Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, than they are at preſent, abating ſome few things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:52164:14"/>For the Deviſor himſelf muſt not Inroll his Will, for the Reaſons before given, and eſpecially for that it is alterable every Hour, and many times made in Extremity, when there can be no authentick Officer to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or Atteſt it.</p>
            <p>And when he is Dead, the Will comes to the Hands of the Executors, and it may be controvertible, and if the Entry then of it by an Executor, or one that pretends to it, ſhould render it Authentick, it may prejudice the Juſt Right of others.</p>
            <p>And on the other ſide, oftentimes the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſee of Lands hath not the Cuſtody of the Will, and it would be unreaſonable that the Executor's Neglect ſhould prejudice the Deviſee's Intereſt.</p>
            <p>I know not how the Caſe of Wills can be made much ſafer or better than it is, at leaſt unleſs the Inſinuation thereof were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Examination of Temporal Courts; but that perchance would be thought too great a Charge.</p>
            <p>Only it were well, if ſome greater Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity were required by Law in Wills, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Lands are deviſed; for ever ſince the Stat. of 34. <hi>H.</hi> 8. more Queſtions,<note place="margin">Stat. Fraud.</note> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Law, touching the Conſtruction of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52164:14"/>
Wills, but alſo of Fact, ariſe, than in any five General Titles or Concerns of Lands beſides. As, Whether a Will were made or not? Whether revoked or not? Whether the Party that made it were of a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Memory, or not? which multiplies Suits, and makes great Uncertainties.</p>
            <p>But an Act may be neceſſary to prefix a Time and Order for Claims to burned Houſes in <hi>London,</hi> and a Judicatory ſettled for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining thereof ſummarily;<note place="margin">London <hi>Burnt.</hi>
               </note> becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, poſſibly Latent Incumbrances may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe upon thoſe that have been at great Charges in Building.</p>
            <p>But it were far better, that there might be an Act to quiet the Enjoyment of thoſe that have built according to the Decrees, and under the Rules already decreed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Charge hath made the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſaved it from the Forfeiture which would otherwiſe have happened; therefore no Reaſon their Poſſeſſion ſhould be diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And beſides, all Perſons that had any pretence of Claim, either have made it, and their Claims examined by a publick Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or might have done in ſo long a ſpace, which they have neglected, and it hath been their own faults.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52164:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>Therefore this Caſe touching the burned Houſes being particular, in a particular Precinct, and thus circumſtantiated, will not make any Parallel Caſe to Univerſal Regiſters.</p>
