            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therfore the wise Philosopher, being dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded what was the gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test thing in the world? aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, it was the valiaunte heart of a man, that coulde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne and lightly esteme the high &amp; mighty things of the world. For honor and
<pb facs="tcp:6603:7"/>
dignitie hath no assurance, and in Fortunes fauoure is no stabilitie. <hi>Philip</hi> king of <hi>Macedone</hi> obteined in one day three notable victories: After the which he is sayd to haue kneeled downe vpon the grounde, holding vp his handes vnto the Heauens, crying out in this wise: O Lady <hi>Fortune</hi> most vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, O my happie deste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, I humbly beseech you, that after this greate honor and glory, whiche you nowe
<pb facs="tcp:6603:7"/>
haue giuen mee, you woulde moderate and temper the troubles &amp; afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which in time to come you will lay vpon mee. For commonly, gret prosperitie is a messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to greeuous calamitie, &amp; nothing in this life is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn or sure. As <hi>Socrates</hi> affirmed when he sayd, that the certaynest thing in this worlde was, that all things were vncertaine. It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that diuers Captaynes came vnto <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:6603:8"/>
requested hym to walke vp vnto the hill called <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> where (saide they) you shal see great wealthy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantes vttering a world of riches and pretious Iewels. His aunswere was this, if I coulde buy or sell, yea or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge their sorow for mirth, sicknesse for helthe, deathe for life: I would the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> goe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and spende all that I haue: but I see (quoth he) that the biers &amp; sellers, yea and the very things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb facs="tcp:6603:8"/>
are condemned to die and to perishe. Wherefore neither the sight of any thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, nor the obtayning of anye thing there, can better mine estate, or help me at the hour of death, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I must creepe into my graue. For although honor, wealthe, and riches, beare great rule amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet they preuaile not against death. To verefie the same, I could wishe (right Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) other testimonie,<note place="margin">

Thus you may see, howe lothsome our life is, and howe vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne the transitorie things of this world are. I hold him therefore most wisest, that so liueth as though he shoulde always die. There came one vnto Diogenes &amp; sayd: O what a miserable thing it is to liue in this worlde: vnto whom he answered: my fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d you are deceiued, for it is no misery for a man to liue, but it is a miserable thing for a
