            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe same <hi>occasion</hi> that hath this day brought
you together in this <hi>place,</hi> hath also brought this
<hi>Text</hi> to my <hi>hand.</hi> Wherein (as <hi>Expositors</hi> for the
most part conceive of it) you have a generall
<hi>Citation,</hi> or <hi>Processe</hi> issuing out of the <hi>high Court
of Heaven</hi> against the <hi>Church</hi> and people of the <hi>Iews,</hi> sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning
and requiring them to come and appeare before the
<hi>Tribunall</hi> of the great God, there to make answer to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
that should be objected against them. The <hi>Quarrell</hi> in
brief was this. In that <hi>Church</hi> (as in every Church there ever
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56371:4"/>
have been, and will be) there were many <hi>formall Hypocrites,</hi>
such as stood much upon legall <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> in so
much as they placed all their <hi>Religion</hi> in those <hi>externall obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,</hi>
in the mean time over-looking those <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <hi>The weightier things of the

the true inward <hi>Spirituall worship</hi> and service of God.
Hereupon the Lord by his Prophet here cites and summons
the whole Church to come, and give an account of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<hi>formalitie. Gather my Saints together unto me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the words we might take notice of two particulars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
<hi>Processe,</hi> and the <hi>Persons.</hi> The <hi>Processe,</hi> or <hi>Citation</hi> it selfe in the
first words, <hi>Gather together unto me</hi> (or <hi>before me.</hi>) The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
cited, summoned, you have them here described, first, by
their <hi>Quality,</hi> they were <hi>Saints, Gods</hi> Saints. <hi>Gather my Saints
together unto me.]</hi> Secondly, by their <hi>Act,</hi> they were <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters;</hi>
which <hi>Act</hi> is amplified by the <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Solemnitie</hi>
of it, they were such as had made a <hi>Covenant</hi> with their God,
and that a <hi>solemne</hi> Covenant, <hi>Those that have made a Covenant
with me by Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is this last <hi>branch</hi> of the Text that my eie is upon at this
time, being led to it by the present occasion; wherein you
have the <hi>Saints</hi> of God described to be such as had made a
<hi>Covenant,</hi> a <hi>solemne Covenant</hi> with their God: <hi>[Those that
have made a Covenant with me by Sacrifice.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>By Sacrifice,] Gnales Zabach,</hi> (saith the Originall) <hi>super Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificium,
Over Sacrifice:</hi> This <hi>Clause</hi> I find diversly construed
by divers <hi>Expositors,</hi> some carrying it one way, some another,
according to a threefold interpretation of the precedent word
<hi>Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 By <hi>Saints</hi> some here understand the <hi>Faithfull</hi> people of
God among the <hi>Iews,</hi> the select companie of <hi>True VVorshipers.</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56371:4"/>
Taking the word in that sense, they conceive this latter clause
to be a description of them. They were such as had made a
<hi>Covenant with God over Sacrifice,</hi> that is (say they) <hi>over</hi> and
<hi>besides</hi> Sacrifice, or <hi>in stead</hi> of Sacrifice. So they explain the
words, <hi>super Sacrificium, i.e. praeter Sacrificium,</hi> or <hi>pro Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio.
Besides</hi> Sacrifice; they were such as did not rest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
contented in any Legall Ceremonie, they did not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistere
<hi>in cerenis umbris</hi> (as <hi>Calvin</hi> speaks,) <hi>sit down in those sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows;</hi>
they apprehended that there was <hi>aliquid altius,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of a <hi>higher nature</hi> in the Covenant betwixt God and his
people, and that they mainly looked at, and applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto. Or <hi>in stead</hi> of Sacrifice. In stead of those <hi>legall
Sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>ceremoniall observances,</hi> (wherein the greatest
part placed all their Religion,) they <hi>consecrated themselves</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord, gave up themselves unto God by a <hi>solemne Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note>
In stead of those <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> Sacrifices, of
<hi>bruit beasts,</hi> they offered up unto God that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

that <hi>Living Sacrifice,</hi> that <hi>Reasonable service;</hi> devoting
themselves to the true inward spirituall worship and service of
God, whereunto they had bound themselves by solemne
Vow and Covenant. This Exposition I find <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerus</hi>
after him, not wholy disallowing.</p>

some others here carrie it.</p>
            <p>3 But not to rest in either of these: There is yet a third, and
a last sense, which I rather incline unto, apprehending it both
more <hi>simple</hi> and <hi>genuine.</hi> The persons to whom this <hi>Citation</hi>
is here directed they were not any <hi>select companie,</hi> whether of
<hi>True Worshippers,</hi> or <hi>Formall Hypocrites,</hi> but the <hi>whole body</hi> of the
Jewish Church, collectively considered, consisting of both
these, yet here called by the name of <hi>Saints,</hi> Because there
were some, and no question many such amongst them, <hi>Saints
in truth</hi> as well, as in <hi>appearance.</hi> Now the determination
here (as often elswhere) is taken from the better part. <hi>It is an
honour</hi> (saith <hi>Calvin,</hi> writing upon the Text <hi>which God putteth
upon his Saints, to denominate a promiscuous multitude consisting
of good and bad from them;</hi> I, though they be the far lesse num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
That was the case here in the Text. In the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church
at this time, the greatest part were no better then <hi>formall Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,</hi>
yet in as much as there was a partie of <hi>Saints</hi> amongst
them, God calleth them all by this name. Secondly, If they
were not all <hi>Saints,</hi> yet they ought to have been so. They were
all <hi>Saints by calling,</hi> called to be Saints, and so called <hi>Saints,</hi>
and that to put them in mind of their <hi>Dutie,</hi> what ones they
all ought to be. Now taking the word in this sense, we shall
finde this subsequent clause to be a description generally of
all the <hi>visible members</hi> of that <hi>visible Church,</hi> they were such
as had <hi>made a Covenant with God over Sacrifice; with</hi> Sacrifice,
by Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:56371:5"/>
For the full and cleere understanding whereof wee might
take notice of an ancient <hi>custome</hi> in use both amongst the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and other <hi>Nations</hi> also, who were wont in
their making of <hi>Covenants,</hi> for the greater <hi>solemnity</hi> of them,
to make them, <hi>with</hi> or by <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Which they did after this
manner. Having <hi>slain</hi> the Sacrifice they <hi>divided,</hi> laying the
parts one over against the other, and so the <hi>Covenanters</hi> went
between them. Thus the <hi>Lord</hi> himself (who was the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituter
of this Ceremonie) made a Covenant with <hi>Abraham,<note place="margin">Gen. 15. 18.</note>
Gen. 15.</hi> Intending there to make a solemne Covenant with
him,<note place="margin">Ver. 9, 10.</note> he directeth <hi>Abraham</hi> what to do, <hi>viz. Take an Heighfer,
and a Goat and a Ram, &amp;c.</hi> And what should he do with them?
Why divide them in pieces, parting them asunder, laying the
parts one against the other. And to what end was this? Why
that the Lord might <hi>passe betwixt them,</hi> which accordingly
he did in that visible signe of a <hi>Burning Lampe in the midst of a
smoaking furnace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 17.</note> Verse 17. <hi>Behold a smoaking furnance and a
Burning Lampe passed between those pieces.</hi> Thus did <hi>God</hi> make
this Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> a Covenant <hi>with,</hi> or <hi>By Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus the Lords people, the people of the <hi>Iews,</hi> were
wont to make Covenant with him. Bringing a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord they cut it in pieces, and so passed betwixt the
parts. Such a <hi>Covenant</hi> the Lord putteth the <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
of <hi>Israel</hi> in minde of that they had made with him,<note place="margin">Ier. 34. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Ier. 34.
18. The Covenant which they had made before me, when they cut
the Calf in twain, and passed betweene the parts thereof.</hi> This it
seemeth was their Custome, which as they took it from <hi>God</hi>
himself, so the <hi>Heathens</hi> borrowed it from them, who were
wont to make their Covenants also after the same manner.

(as our <hi>Aynsworth</hi> elswhere wel observes it) cometh that phrase
of <hi>Striking</hi> or <hi>Cutting</hi> a Covenant.<note place="margin">Ayns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, sup. Psal. 25. 10. Ps. 89. 3.</note>

viz.</hi> by <hi>cutting</hi> of the Sacrifice and parting it a sunder
have <hi>made a covenant</hi> with me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Such a Covenant had the people of the</hi> Iews <hi>entred and
made with their God, a</hi> Covenant, <hi>and a</hi> Solemne <hi>Covenant.</hi>

with their God. <hi>Upon these two I shall insist severally,

Application.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1 <hi>The Lords people are all Covenanters,</hi> snch as have struck
a Covenant with God. Such were the members of the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Church; and such are the true members of <hi>Christian</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
A truth which needeth no confirmation. This it is that
gives both <hi>Esse,</hi> and <hi>Distinguere,</hi> that <hi>maketh</hi> a people to be
<hi>Gods</hi> people, and <hi>distinguisheth</hi> them from all other people;
Even the <hi>Covenant</hi> betwixt God and them. This it was that
distiuguished the <hi>seed of Abraham,</hi> and the people of the
<hi>Iews</hi> from all other people in the World, and that made them
Gods people, even the <hi>Covenant</hi> betwixt God and them, the
<hi>signe</hi> and <hi>seale</hi> whereof they carried in their <hi>flesh,</hi> the <hi>Seale of</hi>
Circumcision,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 13.</note> which is therefore called <hi>The Covenant. My

And this it is that now distinguisheth the <hi>true Church</hi>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56371:6"/>
whereof are the two <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the new Testament, <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,</hi>
and the <hi>Lords Supper;</hi> both Seals of this Covenant;
the one of their <hi>entrance</hi> into Covenant, the other of their
<hi>continuance</hi> in that Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> For the opening and illustrating of this,<note place="margin">Q.</note> the Question
will be; <hi>What is this Covenant betwixt God and his People?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To this the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> will return us an answer in
a few words,<note place="margin">A.</note> 
               <hi>Ier. 31. This is the Covenant that I will make with
the house of Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 31. 33</note> &amp;c. <hi>I will be their God, and they shall be my
People,</hi> This is the Covenant which God maketh with them;
and from thence we may easily learne what is the Covenant
that they make with him, the one being but a <hi>Counterpaine</hi>
to the other, <hi>viz. That he shall be their God, and they will be his
People.</hi> It is the nature of <hi>Covenants</hi> to be <hi>mutuall.</hi> And such
is the Covenant betwixt God and his people, consisting of
two parts; the Covenant on <hi>Gods part,</hi> and the Covenant on
<hi>their parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Covenant on Gods part</hi> is, that <hi>hee will be their God, and
they shall be his People.</hi> So ran the Covenant that God made
with <hi>Abraham. I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed:</hi> And
such is the Covenant that God maketh with his Church and
people in all ages, (it being still one and the same Covenant
for substance) <hi>viz.</hi> that hee will be <hi>their God;</hi> Their God?
What is that? Nay, what is it not? their <hi>Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> their <hi>King,</hi>
their <hi>Saviour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 17 1.</note> their <hi>Deliverer,</hi> their <hi>All,</hi> a <hi>God Alsufficient;</hi>
such a one he is in himself, and such a one he will shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to all that are in Covenant with him; And <hi>They shall be
his People, acknowledged</hi> of him, <hi>favoured</hi> by him: Hee will
<hi>pardon</hi> their sins, hee will <hi>heale</hi> their <hi>infirmities, supply</hi> their
<hi>wants, sanctifie</hi> their <hi>natures,</hi> bestowing upon them all good
things requisite for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That is the Covenant on Gods part.</p>
            <p>But what is the <hi>Covenant on his People part?</hi> That is the
Covenant we have now principally to deal with. That Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56371:7"/>
wherein the Lords people do bind themselves unto him.
Now this is nothing but an <hi>Eccho</hi> to the other, a <hi>Restipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
When the hearts of a people come to close with God,
taking him for their God, and giving up themselves to him
to be his people: When to Gods <hi>[I will be your God, and
you shall be my People]</hi> their Souls <hi>Eccho</hi> backe again <hi>[Lord,
Thou shalt be our God, and we will be thy People.]</hi> Now is this
Covenant made up. Such was the Covenant that <hi>Iacob</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to renew with his God upon his safe returne from his
journey,<note place="margin">Gen. 28 21.</note> Gen. 28. <hi>If the Lord will be with mee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>so that I
return safe to my fathers house,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then shall the Lord be my
God.</hi> Now what is it for a people to <hi>take God for their God?</hi>
Why to engage themselves in the solemne Vow purpose, and
resolution of their hearts that they will <hi>set him up as God,</hi> and
that both in their <hi>Hearts,</hi> and <hi>Lives,</hi> giving all those respects
unto him which are due to a <hi>God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viz.</hi> to <hi>Love</hi> him above all,
to <hi>Feare</hi> him above all, to <hi>Trust</hi> in him above all, to <hi>Worship</hi>
him according to his will, to <hi>walk</hi> before him in the conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
endeavour of an <hi>universall obedience.</hi> This it is for a
man to take God for his God. And this must all the Lords
people doe; striking such a Covenant with God, even a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Obedience.</hi> Such was the Covenant which the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
entred with their God at the giving of the <hi>Law.</hi> Upon
<hi>Moses</hi> his comming downe from the Mount, having received
the <hi>Tables of the Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>Booke of the Covenant,</hi> (the
<hi>Morall, Iudiciall,</hi> and <hi>Ceremoniall Laws</hi>) from God, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the people to enter a <hi>Covenant</hi> with God. And what
was that Covenant?<note place="margin">Ex. 24. 7.</note> Why a <hi>Covenant of Obedience. Hee read
the Book of the Covenant in their eares, And the People said,
All that the Lord hath said we will do it, and be obedient.</hi> This
was the Covenant, for the confirming whereof <hi>Moses</hi> then
<hi>sprinkled upon them the bloud of the Covenant, viz.</hi> the Bloud
of the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> wherewith they made that Covenant. And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56371:7"/>
such a Covenant it is that all the Lords people have made,
and are to make with their God. A <hi>Covenant,</hi> and that</p>
            <p>A <hi>solemne</hi> Covenant; a word of that, and but a word, my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
aime being chiefly at the <hi>Application.</hi> Such a Covenant it was
that the people of the <hi>Iews</hi> had made and often renewed with
their God, not a <hi>slight</hi> but a <hi>solemne</hi> Covenant, a <hi>Covenant
with Sacrifice.</hi> Many were the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> instituted by God,
and observed by his people under the old Testament. Of these
Sacrifices, as there were divers <hi>kinds,</hi> so there were divers
<hi>ends</hi> and <hi>uses;</hi> Amongst other, this was common to them all,
they were all as so many <hi>sigilla, syngraphae,</hi> so many <hi>signes</hi> and
<hi>seals</hi> of the Covenant betweene <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>People. Signes,
Commemorative</hi> signes and tokens, putting them in mind
of the Covenant. <hi>Seals</hi> for confirmation of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
the Covenant on <hi>Gods</hi> part, the Covenant on <hi>their</hi>
part. <hi>On Gods part.</hi> Hereby did God assure them that hee
would be their God. <hi>On their part.</hi> Hereby did they binde
themselves unto him that they would be his people. This
was one common end of all their Sacrifices; the proper and
particular end of some of them.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Sacrifices</hi> they are now ceased: But in the mean time
God hath not left his Church without <hi>signes</hi> and <hi>seals</hi> of this
Covenant. Such are the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the <hi>New Testament;
Baptisme</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper;</hi> both <hi>seals</hi> of this Covenant,
the one (as I told you) a Seal of our <hi>Entrance</hi> into it, the other
of our <hi>continuance</hi> in it. And <hi>with</hi> or by these doe the Lords
people now strike a Covenant with their God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Lord in <hi>Baptisme,</hi> they confirme that gift in the
receiving of the <hi>Supper,</hi> both which are appurtenances to this
Covenant, annexed to it as for the <hi>testification,</hi> and <hi>confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
so for the <hi>solemnization</hi> of it. I might adde Christians
now, as they have their <hi>Sacraments,</hi> so also have they their <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</hi>
their <hi>Propitiatorie</hi> Sacrifice, and their <hi>Eucharisticall</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:56371:8"/>
Sacrifices.<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 26</note> Their <hi>Propitiatorie Sacrifice,</hi> viz. <hi>Christ</hi> himself
the substance of all those Ceremoniall shadows, at whom all
the Legall Sacrifices looked. Their <hi>Eucharisticall Sacrifices,</hi>
their <hi>Spirituall</hi> Sacrifices of <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Prayses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5</note> and other
<hi>spirituall Oblations,</hi> which as <hi>spirituall Priests</hi> they offer up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God. Now <hi>by</hi> and <hi>with</hi> these Sacrifices they are to make
their Covenant with their God.</p>
            <p>1 By and through that <hi>Ilasticall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 8. 6</note> that <hi>Propitiatory</hi> Sacrifice,
the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> who is the <hi>Mediatour</hi> of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
bringing God and man together, and that by by <hi>Passing</hi>
(as I may say) betwixt the <hi>Parties.</hi> An observable difference
betwixt those <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and this <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> There the <hi>Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
passed betwixt the parts of the <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> Here the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
passeth betwixt the <hi>Covenanters, Christ</hi> interposing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as a middle person betwixt two disagreeing parties, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them together; <hi>Reconciling</hi> God to man, and man to
God; first, <hi>meriting,</hi> then <hi>applying</hi> that Reconciliation. And
by and through him it is that Christians are now to make
this Covenant with God; <hi>viz.</hi> with an eye to <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>
the Mediatour of this Covenant; Taking God for their
God in Christ, and giving up themselves to be his people
in Christ, Thus are they to Covenant <hi>by</hi> Christ, and (as I may
say) <hi>over</hi> Christ. Even as under the Law, the person that
came to offer a <hi>Burnt offering</hi> to the Lord, to make an Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for his sin, (and so to renew his Covenant with God) he
was to stand over his Sacrifice,<note place="margin">Levit. 1. 4.</note> 
               <hi>putting his hand upon the head
thereof,</hi> thereby disburdening himself of his <hi>sin,</hi> and laying
it upon the <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Even thus now under the Gospell,
Christians comming to make or renew their Covenant with
God, they must bring a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> with them, even the <hi>Lord
Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> (represented &amp; shadowed out by those typicall Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
presenting him unto God his Father; withall, laying their
hands upon the <hi>head</hi> of that Sacrifice, by <hi>faith</hi> resting &amp; rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56371:8"/>
upon Jesus Christ, upon the merit of his death and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
for the pardon of all their sins, the acceptation of their
persons, the salvation of their souls. Having thus layed their
hands upon this Sacrifice, now are they to make a Covenant
with God, a <hi>Covenant of obedience.</hi> And thus may they be
said to Covenant <hi>By</hi> and <hi>Over</hi> Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>2 And as <hi>Over,</hi> so <hi>with</hi> Sacrifice. As over this <hi>Propitiatory,</hi>
so with <hi>Gratulatory</hi> Sacrifice. Such a Sacrifice it is the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
calleth for from this Covenanting people in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Verse of this Psalme. <hi>Offer unto God thanksgiving, and
pay thy vows unto the most high: And call upon mee in the day of
trouble, Verse 15.</hi> These are <hi>Evangelicall</hi> Sacrifices, more
worth then all the Sacrifices of the Law, <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Prayses.</hi>
And these Sacrifices must they offer up that will make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with God; <hi>so making a Covenant with Sacrifice.</hi>
But my promise was not to give way to doctrinall Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The service of the day calleth for <hi>Application,</hi> which
let it be directed only by way of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> whereof Take
these three Branches.</p>
            <p>1 That wee would all of us strike such a Covenant with our

            <p>2 That having struck this Covenant, wee would be mindfull
of it.</p>
            <p>3 That being mindfull of it, wee would be faithfull in it.</p>
            <p>Begin with the first, which putteh us all upon this <hi>act of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Covenanting.</hi> As many of us as desire to be owned of God
as his people, let us strike a <hi>Covenant,</hi> a <hi>solemne Covenant</hi> with
him. This is that which the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> saith of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the children of <hi>Iuda</hi> returning out of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie
should doe, and excite one an other to doe it: <hi>Ier. 50.
Come</hi> (shall they say) <hi>and let us joyne our selves to the Lord in a
perpetuall Covenant that shall not be forgotten.</hi>

one another to do it. <hi>Come let us joyne our selves unto

Exhortation to a people that are in Covenant with God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready?
This work is not now to doe; we have all of us done
it alreadie. We have given up our <hi>names,</hi> and wee have given
up our <hi>selves</hi> unto the Lord. This we have done in <hi>Baptisme,</hi>
and this wee have done in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi>
both Seals of this Covenant. Thus are we a people in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with God alreadie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> And were not the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Juda</hi> so? They were a people in Covenant with God
before, and in their captivity, being the <hi>seed of Abraham,</hi> and
carrying the seal of the Covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in their flesh. Yet for all that
wee finde them there taking up thoughts and resolutions of
<hi>ioyning</hi> themselves to the Lord in a Covenant, and that by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing</hi>
the same Covenant.</p>
            <p>A practice frequent amongst the people of God in the old
Testament. Many instances wee meet with, holding forth to
us <hi>presidents</hi> for this <hi>practice,</hi> the <hi>renewing of Covenant.</hi> This
we find the people of God doing upon divers occasions. Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

when having broken his Covenant, the Judgements of
God were out against them, either present or imminent, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or felt. In these cases we shall see them ordinarily apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves to this Remedie, the renewing of Covenant.
Take but two instances for both; the first of <hi>Asah,</hi> the second
of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> both obvious. The former <hi>2 Chron. 15.</hi> There
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56371:9"/>
you shall finde King <hi>Asah</hi> and his people making a solemne
Covenant with God:<note place="margin">2 Chron. 15. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Verse 12. And they entred into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to seek the Lord God of their fathers, withall their heart, and
with all their soul,</hi> &amp;c. This they did, and upon what occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
did they it? Why, at that time they stood guiltie of a
great <hi>Defection;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 3.</note> so you have it, <hi>Verse 3. Now for a long time</hi>
Israel <hi>hath bin without the true God, and without a teaching Priest,
and without Law.</hi> A wonderfull defection; And behold <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction</hi>
following it, great <hi>Affliction,</hi> great <hi>Distraction,</hi> great
<hi>vexation;</hi> so it follows. <hi>Verse 5. And in those times there was
no peace to him that went out,<note place="margin">Ver. 5.</note> nor to him that came in, but great
vexations were upon the inhabitants of the Countries.</hi> Such was
their condition. In this condition what course take they?
Why they apply themselves to this as the most sovereigne
remedie, <hi>They entred into a Covenant to seek the Lord their God,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The like did</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>as you may see in the 29 chapter of
the same Book.</hi> Now it is in mine heart to make a Covenant,
<hi>(saith</hi> Hezekiah) Verse 10. <hi>Not a</hi> Personall,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 29. 10.</note> 
               <hi>but a</hi> Nationall
<hi>Covenant. And what occasioned it? Why first, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
at that time lay under the guilt of a great</hi> Defection: <hi>The</hi>
Worship <hi>of God had been</hi> neglected, <hi>the</hi> Temple ruinous <hi>and</hi> pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted:<note place="margin">Ver. 6.</note>
               <hi>So you have it in the 6 and 7 Verses of that Chapter,</hi>
Our fathers have trespassed and done that which was evill in the
eyes of the Lord our God, and have forsaken him, and have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
away their faces from the habitation of the Lord, and turned
their backs; Also they have shut up the doores of the Porch, and
put out the Lamps, and have not burnt Incense, nor offered burnt
offerings in the holy place unto the God of Israel.<note place="margin">Ver. 15</note> 
               <hi>Thus was the</hi>
Temple-worship <hi>neglected, the place unfrequented, nay</hi> polluted.
<hi>In the fifth Verse of the Chapter,</hi> Hezekiah <hi>calls for the</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits,
<hi>requiring them to</hi> sanctifie themselves, <hi>and to</hi> sanctifie the
house of the Lord, and to carry forth the filthinesse out of the holy
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56371:10"/>
place. <hi>Lying under this great Defection, they were also under
great</hi> Affliction;<note place="margin">Ver. 8.</note> 
               <hi>So it followeth, Verse 8, 9.</hi> Wherefore the wrath
of the Lord was upon <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and he hath delivered
them unto trouble, to astonishment, and unto hissing. For loe our
Father have falne by the sword,<note place="margin">Ver. 9.</note> and our sonnes, and our daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and our wives are in Captivity for this. <hi>Such was their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
condition. And hereupon it is that that worthy Reformer
betakes himselfe, and his people to this course, the renewing
of Covenant.</hi> Now it is in my heart to make a Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To these instances (if need were) I might adde that other
in the days of</hi> Nehemiah. <hi>The people were generally guiltie
of a great</hi> Defection. <hi>So much the</hi> Levits <hi>in their names con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, and acknowledge.</hi> Nehem. 9. 34, 35.<note place="margin">Neh. 9. 34.</note> Wee have done wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly:
Neither have our Kings, nor our Princes, our Priests, nor
our Fathers kept thy Law,<note place="margin">Ver. 35.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For they have not served thee in
their Kingdom, and in thy great goodnesse that thou gavest them,
and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them. <hi>That</hi>
Defection <hi>was followed with great</hi> Affliction: <hi>so you have in
the Verses following.</hi> Behold we are servants this day, and for
the land that thou gavest unto our Fathers to eat the fruit thereof,<note place="margin">Ver. 36.</note>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> behold wee are servants in it:<note place="margin">Ver. 37.</note> And it yieldeth much increase
to the Kings whom thou hast set Over us, because of our sins: also
they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattell at their
pleasure, And we are in great distresse. <hi>Now in this condition,
behold them betaking themselves to the same course.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of all this wee make a sure Covenant,<note place="margin">Ver. 38.</note> and write it, and our
Princes, Levits, and Priests seal unto it. <hi>Verse 38.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This were they wont to doe upon these <hi>occasions.</hi> Now
whether there be the <hi>same occasions</hi> to be found amongst us,
us of this <hi>Nation,</hi> or no, I suppose there is none of us here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
wil make any question of it. Alas the Evidence is but too
cleer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that as for our present <hi>Affliction,</hi> so for our former
<hi>Defection;</hi> the one of which usually attends upon the other;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56371:10"/>
               <hi>Affliction</hi> upon <hi>Defection,</hi> so you find it in all the places fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned;
and so we (at least many of our brethren) in this
Kingdome finde it by sad and wofull experience at this day.
Our <hi>Defection</hi> went before, and that a great Defection. The
<hi>Temple</hi> of God amongst us scoured (blessed be God) the <hi>doors</hi>
thereof were not shut up, yet we cannot say but it was <hi>pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
and that by bringing in <hi>humane Inventions</hi> to thrust out
divine Ordinances. The <hi>Lamps</hi> some of them <hi>extinguished,</hi>
and put out, the most of them <hi>burning dim,</hi> either for want of
<hi>oile,</hi> or <hi>snuffing.</hi> How few <hi>Burning and shining Lamps?</hi> The
<hi>Worship</hi> of God for the most part how was it turned to a meer
<hi>Formalitie?</hi> our condition therein being but too like that of
<hi>Israels</hi> herein the Text; little to be seene in most places but a
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the meager carcasse of a cold and formall devotion,
The <hi>heart</hi> of Religion being well nigh eaten out: Little <hi>power</hi>
of it to be found in the <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>lives</hi> of the greatest part.
Multitudes of <hi>scandalous</hi> persons swarming every where, and
yet continued members of the Church.<note place="margin">Ps. 50. 17</note> 
               <hi>Swearers, Drunkards,
Vnclean Persons, Prophane Persons,</hi> such as <hi>hated Reformation,</hi>
yet even they <hi>taking the Covenant of God</hi> (the Seal of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant)
<hi>in their mouthes,</hi> polluting the holy Ordinances of
God by their unworthy partaking in them. For the rest, how
have the greatest part been either meerly <hi>Civill,</hi> or else <hi>Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme.</hi>
Little <hi>Heate,</hi> little <hi>Life,</hi> little <hi>Power</hi> of Godlinesse to
be felt or seene. Surely our <hi>Defection,</hi> and our <hi>Provocations</hi>
have beene great. And our <hi>Affliction</hi> at this day seemes to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
it. Our case being now the very same with <hi>Israels</hi> in the
days of King <hi>Asah;<note place="margin">2 Chron. 15. 5, 6.</note> In those times there was no peace to him
that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon
all the Inhabitants of the Countries; And Nation was destroyed of
Nation, and Citie of Citie, for God did vex them with all adversity.</hi>
So was it with them: And is it not so with us at this
day? Now, in this condition what shall wee doe? Why,
<hi>Now let us joyne our selves to the Lord in a perpetuall Covenant.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56371:11"/>
Now;</hi> never was Covenant more seasonable, more needfull
for any people, then it is for <hi>England</hi> at this day. Let us <hi>now</hi>
make a Covenant with the Lord our God, and that a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall</hi>
Covenant. Covenants wee have made, but alasse
they have beene <hi>temporary, momentanie,</hi> soone forgotten.
<hi>Let us now joyne our selves to the Lord in a perpetuall Covenant that
shall not be forgotten.</hi> No way so hopefull as this to appease the
<hi>wrath</hi> that is gone out, smoaking against us, and burning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, to put an end to our present <hi>Afflictions,</hi> and <hi>Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi>
to <hi>remove</hi> the Evils which we feel, to <hi>prevent</hi> the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which we fear, to <hi>procure</hi> the mercies which we want,
to <hi>continue</hi> the mercies wee enjoyne, to stay our God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> True (you may say) were it onely such a Covenant,<note place="margin">Object.</note> a
<hi>joyning our selves to the Lord in a Covenant,</hi> then might wee
hope for such an issue. But alasse this Covenant here propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and tendered to us, wee finde it to be of another nature,
containing in it somthings to us <hi>impertinent,</hi> and others scarce
<hi>warrantable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A.</note> Here I know some thing will be expected by way of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
Give me leave as briefly &amp; as fully as I may, or can,
<hi>Liber are animam</hi> to <hi>discharge conscience,</hi> both mine own &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
by resolving such scruples as are most obvious, and as I
conceive) of greatest importance. In the <hi>Generall</hi> take the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
thus. Though this be not the <hi>onely</hi> thing in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
yet I take it (and so would I have every one here
present to looke upon it) to be the <hi>mayne,</hi> viz. <hi>The ioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our selves, and the whole Kingdome to the Lord.</hi> What
else means this grand Designe of a <hi>through Reformation,</hi> a
<hi>Personall,</hi> a <hi>Nationall Reformation Personall</hi> of our own <hi>hearts,
lives, Families: Nationall</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> the three <hi>Kingdoms.</hi>
The former we promise to performe, the latter we engage our
selves by all lawfull ways in our severall places, and Stations
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56371:11"/>
to endeavour. And what is this but a <hi>Ioyning our selves to the
Lord by Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some particulars, I confesse, here may be found, which at
the first sight may seeme to be <hi>heterogeneall,</hi> some of them
<hi>Forraigne,</hi> and others of them of meer <hi>Civill</hi> concernment, but
upon a review we shal find most of them (if not all of them) to
lie in a way of <hi>tendency</hi> unto that great and maine end, (like
so many lesser <hi>streams</hi> which though happily they have their
severall windings and turnings, yet at the length they all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
and unload themselves into the same common <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell</hi>)
All of them conducing either <hi>Immediatly</hi> or <hi>mediatly</hi>
to the promoting of this desired <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 To this purpose tends that first branch of the <hi>first Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,</hi>
where wee promise to endeavour the <hi>preservation of
the Reformed Religion in the Church of Scotland against the COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON
ENEMY.</hi> A clause which seemeth to look direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon <hi>them,</hi> but withall it reflects and looks back upon <hi>us,</hi>
who are much interssed &amp; concerned in their (whether <hi>woe,</hi> or)
<hi>welfare.</hi> In their <hi>peace</hi> we may the rather hope for peace. In their
<hi>Ruine</hi> we cannot look long to survive. Such are the mutuall
<hi>engagements</hi> and <hi>concerments</hi> of both Kingdomes, as that in all
probabilitie they are like to <hi>stand</hi> or <hi>fall, sinke</hi> or <hi>swim</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And such is that other Clause in the Close of the same
Article, where wee promise to endeavour the <hi>bringing of
all the Churches in the three Kingdomes to the neerest conjunction, and
uniformitie in Religion, Government,</hi> &amp;c. A Designe of high
concernment. No one thing tending more directly to the
setling and establishing of the true <hi>Religion</hi> of God in all of
them.</p>
            <p>2 To like purpose is the obligation in that <hi>second Article,</hi>
which ingageth all to endeavour the extirpation of <hi>Popery,</hi>
and the <hi>eradicating</hi> of such other <hi>evill weeds,</hi> as may endanger
the sucking out the <hi>heart</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> how ever hinder the
<hi>growth</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:56371:12"/>
3 To the same purpose, (as <hi>truly;</hi> though not so <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly</hi>)
tends that ingagement in the <hi>third Article,</hi> for the
<hi>mutuall preservation of the RIGHTS and PRIVILEDGES
of PARLIAMENTS, and the Liberties of the Kingdomes,</hi>
with the joint-preservation and defence of his <hi>Majesties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and authoritie.</hi> Which, of what concernment they are for
the establishing, and preserving of the true Religion of God,
I shall not need to tell you. The <hi>Laws,</hi> and just <hi>Liberties</hi> of a
Kingdome, they are as the <hi>outworks</hi> to <hi>Religion.</hi> If these be
surprized, or stormed, taken in, it is not to bee expected that
<hi>Religion</hi> should long hold out. And therefore not onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediencie,
but necessitie requires, that they should be taken
into the same <hi>counsels</hi> with Religion it selfe. Of these Laws,
and Liberties, the <hi>Kings Majestie</hi> with his <hi>Parliaments,</hi> are by
office the proper <hi>Guardians,</hi> the <hi>grand Conservatours.</hi> Great
Reason then their should be a speciall respect had unto them
upon whom under God wee have such an immediate depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
either for our <hi>welfare,</hi> or <hi>wee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might go on, and shew you the like in the three other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.
The <hi>discovery of Incendiaries,</hi> persons dangerous to
the <hi>Church,</hi> or dangerous to the <hi>State,</hi> such as shall seeke and
endeavour the <hi>breeding,</hi> or <hi>fomenting</hi> of <hi>Divisions</hi> in either, and
consequently indanger the Ruine of both; of which you may
read, <hi>Article 4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The endeavour of <hi>preserving the Cevill Peace and Union
betwixt the two Kingdoms,</hi> a mercy denied to our Forefathers,
now setled and established by the mutuall agreement of both
<hi>Parliaments,</hi> spoken of <hi>Article 5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The mutuall <hi>defence</hi> and <hi>assistance</hi> of all that are or shall be
<hi>confederated</hi> with us, in the <hi>lawfull pursuit of this Covenant,</hi>
mentioned, <hi>Article 6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All these how conducible they are to the <hi>maine end</hi> here
propounded, I suppose there is none that looketh right upon
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56371:12"/>
them with an impartiall and unprejudiced eye, but will readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see. And being <hi>subservient</hi> thereunto, no reason why any
should scruple the admittance of them within the verge and
pale of a <hi>Religious Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> Why,<note place="margin">Object.</note> but it may be said; In this <hi>Covenant</hi> there are
some things which may seem not onely <hi>heterogeneall</hi> to <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
but <hi>incompatible</hi> and inconsistent with it: Passages sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to just scruple, which a tender conscience cannot but
stumble at. In the taking of an <hi>Oath</hi> there are three main re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisites.
Wee finde them all together in that knowne Text,
<hi>Ier. 4.<note place="margin">Ier. 4. 2.</note> Thou shalt sweare the Lord liveth. in Truth, in Iudgment, and
in Righteousnesse.</hi> Now, as for the <hi>first</hi> of these (may some say)
it is possible to observe it; (and I wish it may be so by all that
shall adventure upon this Covenant this day) <hi>viz.</hi> to sweare
in <hi>Truth,</hi> in the uprightnesse, and sinceritie of the heart; But
how the <hi>second?</hi> how the <hi>third?</hi> How in <hi>Iudgment?</hi> how in
<hi>Righteousnesse?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alleg. 1. How in Iudgment?</hi> When as there are some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
here, which the greatest part understand not, know
not what they mean. Such is the <hi>Doctrine, Worship, Discipline,
and Government of the Church of Scotland;</hi> And such are the
<hi>Right and Priviledges of Parliaments,</hi> with the <hi>Liberties of the
Kingdomes;</hi> things which the greatest part are wholly, or in
a great part ignorant of. And how can they engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to defend and maintain what they know not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I answer; as well as to maintain the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi>
or the <hi>Prerogatives</hi> of the <hi>Prince,</hi> neither of which are obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to every vulgar eye, few having an exact and distinct
cognizance of them: And yet none (upon that ground) scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
the engaging of themselves by solemne <hi>Oaths</hi> (such as the
Oath of <hi>Allegiance, Supremacie,</hi> &amp;c. to defend, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
them.</p>
            <p>2 But secondly, how ever wee may be ignorant of some
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56371:13"/>
               <hi>particulars,</hi> yet I suppose the <hi>generals</hi> of both, either are, or
may be known by all that are not affectedly ignorant.</p>
            <p>3 But thirdly; Take notice that, as for the <hi>Dostrine and
Discipline</hi> of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> wee are not bound to
<hi>Observe,</hi> but to <hi>Preserve</hi> it. Not to observe it <hi>here,</hi> but to
preserve it <hi>there,</hi> and that onely <hi>against the common Enemies</hi> of
both Churches, both Kingdomes. Which is no more, then
(for ought I know) wee may engage our selves to doe to any
other of the forregne Reformed Churches, notwithstanding
their <hi>Doctrine, Worship, Discipline</hi> be not exactly <hi>knowne</hi> unto
us, or (it may be) in some particulars not <hi>approved</hi> by us.</p>
            <p>4 An in the fourth place, As for <hi>Parliament-Priviledges, and
Kingdoms-Liberties,</hi> the oblgation here layed upon us for the
maintaining of them, it bindeth us no further, then as they
shall be <hi>declared,</hi> &amp; <hi>evidenced</hi> to us to be such. The like where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
I may say of those ill weeds mention'd in the <hi>second Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
Superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Heresie, Schisme;</hi> which we here ingage our selves
to endeavour the <hi>Extirpation</hi> of. Here the engagement reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not to what ever shall be called by these names,<note place="margin">Acts 25 19.</note> (The <hi>Iews
Religion. Festus</hi> calls it <hi>Superstition, Acts 25.</hi> The <hi>Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
by the <hi>Iews</hi> is called <hi>Heresie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 24 14.</note> Acts 24. And our <hi>Iust sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is by them called <hi>Schisme,</hi>)
but what shall be evidenced so to be by the <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>Word,</hi>
and <hi>consent</hi> of the <hi>Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alleg.</hi> 2 But you wil say (in the second place,) Though
happilie we may sweare in <hi>Iudgement,</hi> understanding what we
swear to; yet, <hi>how in Iustice?</hi> how in <hi>Righteousnesse?</hi> Here is
the Pinche, Seeing there is somwhat in this Covenant, which
we engage our endeavours for the extirpation of, which the
<hi>Law</hi> hath planted; If not the Law of <hi>God,</hi> yet the Law of the
<hi>Land.</hi> It is <hi>Prelacie,</hi> by name a <hi>Plant</hi> (say some) of <hi>Gods own
planting,</hi> planted by the hands either of <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, or his
<hi>Apostles,</hi> or at least of <hi>Apostolicall men</hi> in the times of some of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56371:13"/>
the Apostle, And as <hi>planted</hi> them, so <hi>watered</hi> by the Churches
of Gost in all succeeding ages. And shall we find our selves
to endeavour the rooting out of a plant thus <hi>planted,</hi> thus <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Mistake it not. It is not <hi>Prelacy,</hi> (at least not <hi>this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy,</hi>) that ever yet made this Clayme. True it is, <hi>Episcopacy</hi>
hath done it, (with what right, I leave it to those who are
able, to judge,) but <hi>Prelacy</hi> never. <hi>Prelacy</hi> (as the word hath
been commonly taken amongst us) for my own part (if I have
not mistaken it) I have ever looked upon it as an <hi>Exorbitancy</hi>
of <hi>Primitive Episcopacy,</hi> an <hi>Excresence</hi> from that first <hi>Stem,</hi>
and a thing distinct from it. Sure I am, the <hi>Prelacy</hi> here spoken
of is: Which, what it is, the next words explaine, <hi>viz.</hi> the

of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> should by <hi>Authority</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be a meet and convenient Government for the
Church in this Kingdome, it is not conceived that any man
should stand engaged by vertue of this <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> to
oppose Authoritie, in endeavouring the <hi>extirpation</hi> of it;
<hi>That being not this Government, but a new Government. Now wee
doe not sweare against what is not.</hi> Neither can a man properly be
said to endeavour to <hi>eradicate</hi> that which as yet is not <hi>planted.</hi>
Nay more. <hi>Shall there be an Episcopacie or Prelacie found in the
Word as the way of Gospel-Government which Christ hath bequeathed
to his Churches, and this be made appeare; we are so far from swearing
to extirpate such a Prelacie, as that rather wee are bound by vertue of
this Oath to entertaine it as the minde and will of Iesus Christ.</hi>
This I have spoken, (not in my own but in other words) not
to declare my own <hi>private Opinion</hi> in this great controversie
of the Times, the point of <hi>Church-Government,</hi> (accounting it
in my self in this Juncture of times too high <hi>presumption</hi> to
<hi>anticipate</hi> or forestall the Judgment of that <hi>Venerable Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
before whom this controversie now depends, expecting a
speedy and faire Decision according to the evidence of the
Word) but onely to endeavour a <hi>satisfaction</hi> to those of my
<hi>Brethren</hi> or others, who possibly may conscientiously stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at this stone, the supposed <hi>Ius Divinum,</hi> or <hi>Apostolicum</hi> of
<hi>Episcopacie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:56371:14"/>
               <hi>Obi.</hi> But though a <hi>Ius Divinum</hi> be not stamped upon this
Government, yet a <hi>Ius humanum</hi> is. Though it be not of a
<hi>Divine foundation,</hi> yet it standeth established by the <hi>Law of the
Land.</hi> And being so <hi>planted,</hi> how can we engage our selves to
endeavour the <hi>rooting of it out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Here, not to <hi>dispute</hi> what I cannot <hi>determine,</hi> (nor, as it
is supposed, any other) whether it be in every part of it esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by the <hi>Law</hi> or no. Let it be yielded that it is. What
then? Shall we conceive our selves thereby so concluded and
shut up, under this <hi>Government,</hi> as that what ever <hi>inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience</hi>
we shall finde therein, yet we may not by lawfull ways
and means, seek, and endeavour the <hi>alteration</hi> of it. It is a case
which <hi>Subiects</hi> scruple not in the <hi>Laws of the Land;</hi> nor yet
<hi>Freemen</hi> and <hi>Burgesses</hi> of a <hi>Corporation,</hi> or <hi>Members</hi> of
the like <hi>Society,</hi> in the <hi>formes of their Government.</hi> Though
<hi>sworne</hi> to defend and maintaine them, yet finding by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
some evident and notable inconvenience in them,
they will make no scruple (neither need they) to endeavour by
lawfull ways, and meanes a Change and alteration in them.
<hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Forms of Government</hi> though very
usefull in the first institution of them, yet afterwards, through
change of times, they may <hi>degenerate;</hi> and become <hi>unusefull,</hi>
it may be <hi>preiudiciall</hi> and <hi>detrimentall,</hi> crossing that very end
for which they were ordained. Thus is it with <hi>humane Laws</hi>
and <hi>Constitutions,</hi> the best, the wisest of them; they are like
the men that made them, <hi>mutable;</hi> not unlike those <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quours,</hi>
which will grow <hi>flat</hi> and <hi>sowre</hi> with standing. It
is the Priviledge of <hi>Gods Laws,</hi> they never <hi>degenerate,</hi>
never prove <hi>unusefull,</hi> much lesse <hi>detrimentall</hi> to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to whom they are <hi>given,</hi> and by whom they are
observed. But <hi>Humane Laws</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi> may, which
when they doe, no reason why men should be so irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
concluded under them, as that they should not by lawfull
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56371:15"/>
ways and means (let that still be carried along) <hi>seek an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obi. For the better?</hi> I, (may you say) were wee assured of
that we would not be unwilling with such an exchange. But
in the mean time <hi>Alterations</hi> of this nature are <hi>dangerous,</hi> as in
the <hi>State,</hi> so in the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> True, they are so; <hi>viz.</hi> where they are managed by
<hi>precipitate</hi> or <hi>sinister counsels,</hi> not carried on with due <hi>delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
&amp; <hi>advice,</hi> specially where this exchange is made by <hi>Guess</hi>
and not by <hi>Rule;</hi> But that (I trust) will not be found to be
our condition. If multitudes of <hi>unbyassed Counsellours</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
safety, (blessed be God) as yet the Kingdom wants them
not, whether for <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State.</hi> And with what <hi>deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
they have hitherto proceeded in agitating the businesse of
both (specially of the <hi>Church,</hi>) let their <hi>Enemies</hi> judge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their <hi>Protestation</hi> is (and I think wee are bound to believe it)
that all shall be done (as need as may be) by <hi>Rule;</hi> And that
not by a <hi>Lesbian, leaden Rule;</hi> (such as the <hi>Rule of Prudence</hi> is,
which every one may, bow and bend to his own interests) but
by the inflexible <hi>Rule of the Word.</hi> Which if this worke be
framed by, we shall have no cause to fear the alteration.</p>
            <p>Specially if we consider the condition of the present <hi>Church-Government
(no Government</hi>) amongst us, which indeed is little
better then a <hi>Nullitie,</hi> an <hi>Anarchie,</hi> a meere <hi>name</hi> and <hi>shadow</hi> of
Government, the <hi>Coercive power</hi> (which <hi>animates</hi> any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
(being indeed the very <hi>soul</hi> of it, without which it
is but a <hi>cadaverous,</hi> and <hi>livelesse Corps</hi>) being alreadie by an
over-ruling hand of a most immediate providence, taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and that by <hi>unquestionable authoritie.</hi> Now, it is a received
<hi>Maxime, Better any Government, then no Government; Tyranny then
Anarchy.</hi> What the inconveniences of the one (the present
<hi>No-Government</hi>) are, the Church of God amongst us already
feels to her eminent hazard. What ever the <hi>succeeding Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:56371:15"/>
shall be, yet may wee promise to our selves in it a
<hi>comparative happinesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some other scruples possibly may be <hi>started,</hi> but I want
time now to <hi>let slip</hi> after them. Neither are they such (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
but that a little <hi>charity</hi> yielding to the present <hi>necessity,</hi>
will soon take them up, affording them a faire construction,
and Resolution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What then remains, but that this first branch of the</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
<hi>should take place with every of us, that wee would
all of us</hi> Ioyn our selves to the Lord this day in a Covenant, in this
Covenant, <hi>the maine drift and scope whereof the</hi> Preface <hi>and</hi>
Introduction <hi>to it will assure you, is,</hi> The Glory of God, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of the Kingdome of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ, the
Honour and Happinesse of the kings Majesty, and his Posteritie, the
true publick libertie, safetie and peace of the kingdom.</p>
            <p>And <hi>striking</hi> this Covenant with God,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> Let us then (in the
second place) be exhorted to be <hi>mindfull of it.</hi> So the Psalmist
presseth it upon all the Lords People,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 16. 15.</note> 
               <hi>1 Chron. 16. Be yee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
mindful of his Covenant.</hi> None of us here present but have
made a Covenant with our God. Upon our <hi>admission</hi> into
the Church to be <hi>visible members</hi> of it, we entred this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
the summe whereof is (as I told you) that <hi>hee should be
our God, and we would be his People.</hi> This Covenant many of
us, (most of us I suppose) have <hi>ratified</hi> and <hi>confirmed</hi> in our
receiving of the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> Happily some
of us (many of us) have upon occasion <hi>renewed</hi> this Covenant;
It may be in some speciall <hi>distresse,</hi> or upon the receiving of
some speciall <hi>mercie,</hi> wee have laid <hi>new ingagements</hi> upon our
souls, binding them with <hi>new cords,</hi> new <hi>Vows,</hi> new <hi>Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
And this is the service which this day our <hi>God</hi> by the
<hi>hand of Authority</hi> cals us unto. O let us not then be unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of this Covenant. Take wee heed of <hi>forgetting</hi> it. It is
that which <hi>Moses</hi> chargeth upon the people, <hi>Deut. 4.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56371:16"/>
Take heed unto your selves lest ye forget the Covenant of the Lord your
God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 23.</note> A <hi>Caveat</hi> very <hi>necessary;</hi> this being a thing which we
are very <hi>subject to forget;</hi> and the <hi>forgetfulnesse thereof being
of dangerous consequence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 <hi>Subiect we are to forget it.</hi> As for <hi>our Covenants with men,</hi>
we easily remember them; especially if they make for our <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</hi>
But this our Covenant with God, (though most
<hi>advantageous</hi> to us, all the advantage being ours; God is no
ways advantaged by our Covenants; They are neither, <hi>Honour</hi>
nor <hi>Profit</hi> to him, both to us. That we may be confederated
with the great God of heaven and earth, what an <hi>Honour?</hi>
And that we may be interested in all the <hi>promises</hi> of this life,
and a better, what a <hi>Benefit?</hi> yet (for all this) how subject are
we to forget it? An <hi>infirmity</hi> which we have drawn from the
loyns of our <hi>first parents.</hi> They being placed in <hi>Paradice,</hi> in
state of <hi>Innocencie,</hi> yet how soon did they forget the <hi>Covenant</hi>
of the Lord their God? This are we much more subject to.
A truth which <hi>experience</hi> will make good to every ones soule.
Those Vows and Covenants which some of us have made
with our God in time of <hi>distresse</hi> and <hi>trouble,</hi> how soon are
they forgotten? Not unlike <hi>Seamens vows,</hi> which in a <hi>stresse</hi>
at Sea they make freely, but no sooner come a <hi>shore</hi> but they
forget all. Such are our <hi>Vows</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi> for the most
part which we make in our distresses;<note place="margin">Numb, 18. 19.</note> Not <hi>Covenants of Salt,</hi>
(such was Gods Covenant with <hi>Levi,</hi> and such should his
peoples Covenants be with him, <hi>Covenants for perpetuitie</hi>)
but rather <hi>Covenants of Snow,</hi> which as soon as ever the <hi>Sun
shines</hi> upon them they presently <hi>melt</hi> and <hi>vanish</hi> away. This
forgetfulnesse we are very subject to, and therefore great need
of this <hi>Caveat, Take heed least we forget the Covenant of our
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 The <hi>Forgetfulnesse</hi> whereof (in the second place) is of
such <hi>dangerous consequence.</hi> An <hi>intes</hi> to all <hi>Evils,</hi> and that both
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56371:16"/>
of <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>Punishment.</hi> See both in our <hi>first parents.</hi> They for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
the Covenant made with their God, and so venturing
upon the eating of the <hi>forbidden fruit</hi> (a <hi>seale</hi> of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant)
they thereby let in all those evills which have overrun
and drowned all their posterity; even a deluge of <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. No such an <hi>inlet to evils of sin</hi> as this. Whence is it that
<hi>Christians,</hi> (I mean <hi>nominall</hi> Christians) they dare let loose the
reyns to licentiousnesse, yielding up themselves <hi>servants</hi> to
<hi>sin</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> in the obeying and fulfilling of divers inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Lusts, in adventuring upon <hi>fowle,</hi> and (it may be) <hi>scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi>
evils? Certainly they have forgotten the <hi>Covenant,</hi> of
their God.<note place="margin">Pro. 2. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 17.</note> It is that which the wise man sayes of the <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
woman, Prov. 2. She forsaketh the guide of her youth, and
forgetteth the Covenant of her God.</hi> The latter a Reason of the
former. <hi>She forsaketh the guide of her youth.</hi> giveth over herselfe
to adulterous loves, and inchast imbraces of strangers. Why?
Shee hath <hi>forgotten the Covenant of her God;</hi> that is, her <hi>coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
vow,</hi> and promise made in the presence of God. And
whence is it (my brethren) that our <hi>hearts</hi> generally are so
ready to run out inordinately after the <hi>Creatures,</hi> bestowing
those affections upon them which wee owe peculiarly to <hi>God</hi>
and <hi>Iesus Christ?</hi> Surely we have <hi>forgot;</hi> at least do not, as we
ought, <hi>remember</hi> the Covenant of the Lord our God, wherein
we have ingaged our selves to take him for <hi>our God,</hi> to set him
up in our <hi>hearts,</hi> to <hi>love</hi> him, <hi>feare</hi> him, <hi>honour</hi> him, <hi>trust</hi> in him
above all other things.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>No such an inlet to the Evils of Punishment.</hi> For this cause
it is that God threatens his people with the <hi>sword</hi> (of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
judgements the worst) <hi>I will bring a sword upon you that shall
avenge the quarrell of my Covenant.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 25.</note> What was the <hi>Quarrell</hi>
of his <hi>Covenant?</hi> Why they had <hi>forgotten</hi> it, and forgetting
had <hi>violated</hi> it. This lets in the sword, and with it <hi>Pestilence,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:56371:17"/>
and <hi>Famine;</hi> as attendants upon it, (as it followeth in the next
words.) Of such dangerous consequence is it to <hi>forget</hi> this
Covenant which we have made.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the <hi>Remembrance</hi> of it is of great use.
Usefull in <hi>restraining</hi> us from <hi>sin;</hi> Usefull in <hi>putting</hi> us on to
<hi>duty.</hi> In the one a <hi>Bridle,</hi> in the other a <hi>Spur;</hi> both ways very
usefull.</p>
            <p>And therefore (in the fear of God) give way also to this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
branch of the Exhortation. <hi>Remember yee the Covenant
of the Lord your God.</hi> This it is that the Lord here in the Text
putteth his people in minde of, giving them a hint of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
which they had forgotten, that being <hi>put in minde</hi> of
it, they would be <hi>faithfull</hi> in it, not thinking that <hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and those externall observances would serve the
turn, but that they would apply themselves to performe the
<hi>Conditions</hi> of the Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use 3.</hi> And this let every of vs (in the third and last place)
be excited to doe.<note place="margin">Vse 3</note> So <hi>Remember</hi> wee the Covenant of our
God, that we may be <hi>faithfull in it.</hi> Faithfull in <hi>performing the
conditions</hi> of our part; the summe whereof is bound up in this
one word, <hi>Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>True it is indeed, when we have done all we can do, yet we
shall fall short of that <hi>exactnes</hi> of Obedience, which the Law
requireth; there will be many <hi>failings,</hi> many <hi>infirmities.</hi> But
let not these discourage; knowing this for our comfort, that
these failings, where they are not <hi>allowed,</hi> but <hi>bewailed,</hi> and
striven against, they are not properly a <hi>breach</hi> of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
The Covenant that Gods Saints are under (being in
Christ) it is not a Covenant of <hi>Works,</hi> but a Covenant of
<hi>Grace.</hi> In the first Covenant the condition of our parts was,
an <hi>exact</hi> and <hi>perfect obedience;</hi> so as the least failing, the least
deviation or swerving from the <hi>Rule</hi> was a breach of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
But this Covenant it is established upon <hi>better promises,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:56371:17"/>
and <hi>better conditions;</hi> the Lord herein requiring from us not
<hi>Exactnesse</hi> but <hi>Truth,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 2.</note> Sincerity, Uprightnesse. Walk before me,
and be upright.</hi> So as every <hi>failing,</hi> every <hi>straying</hi> from the
<hi>Rule</hi> is not a <hi>Breach</hi> of Covenant, so long as the <hi>heart</hi> is <hi>upright</hi>
with God, not allowing it self in any known evill, any sinfull
<hi>Commission,</hi> or <hi>Omission.</hi> These are the <hi>breaches</hi> of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
when the heart shall <hi>sit loose</hi> from God, taking in any
sinfull lusts to give entertainment to them. And this take we
heed of. How ever there may be, and will be many slips, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
failings in our course, yet take heed of sins against <hi>Light,</hi>
against <hi>Conscience.</hi> Take heed of letting in, and setting up any
sinfull lust in our hearts against the <hi>Convictions</hi> of the <hi>Word.</hi>
This were indeed to deal <hi>falsly</hi> with God in his Covenant. A
<hi>Crime</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> washeth her hands of, <hi>Psal. 44.
All this is come upon us,<note place="margin">Psal. 44. 17.</note> yet have we not dealt falsly in thy Covenant.</hi>
At that time the Church lay under great pressures, great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
<hi>All this is come upon us,</hi> All these <hi>evils,</hi> these <hi>sufferings.</hi>
Yet she professeth her <hi>integrity. She had not dealt falsly in the
Covenant.</hi> What is that? The next words explaine it.
<hi>Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy
way.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verse 18</note> This it is to deal <hi>falsly</hi> in the Covenant. When a mans
<hi>heart is turned back,</hi> and thereupon his <hi>steps decline</hi> from the
way of Gods Commandements, so as hee walketh on in any
sinfull way. O (my Brethren) let it not be layed to the charge
of any of us, that we should thus deal <hi>falsly</hi> in the Covenant
of our God. And therefore, though <hi>perfest</hi> wee cannot be,
yet labour we to be <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>sincere.</hi> Let not our hearts be
turned back from our God, but let us walke before him in the
<hi>constant, and conscionable endeavour of an universall obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>remembring</hi> and <hi>keeping</hi> our Covenant with God, now
be we assured, <hi>that God will remember</hi> his Covenant with us. <hi>He
remembreth his Covenant for ever,</hi>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56371:18"/>
place.<note place="margin">1 Chron. 15.</note> 1 <hi>Chron. 16.</hi> where the former part of this Psalme is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
and from whence it is taken, wee may take notice of
an observable difference in the reading of this passage. In the
Psalme, the words run in the <hi>third</hi> person, as spoken of <hi>God,
He remembreth.</hi> In the <hi>Chronicles</hi> you have them in the <hi>second</hi>
person, as spoken to his <hi>People. Remember yee.</hi> Put them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
they will afford us this usefull observation. That
<hi>if we Remember our Covenant with God, God will remember his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with us; And because he Remembreth his Covenant for ever, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us Remember it for ever.</hi> Herein God for his part will
not be forgetfull; unfaithfull. It is the first branch of <hi>Solomons</hi>
prayer at the <hi>Dedication of the Temple.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 6. 14.</note> O Lord God of Israel there
is no God like unto thee, &amp;c. which keepest covenant and mercy to thy
servants, that walke before thee with all their hearts.</hi> Marke it.
Though there may be many slips and failings in the walkings
of Gods people, their foot may often tread awry, yet walking
before God <hi>with all their hearts,</hi> in uprightnesse and sincerity,
the Lord will <hi>keep Covenant</hi> with them, and <hi>shew mercy</hi> to
them in <hi>pardoning</hi> their sins, <hi>accepting</hi> their services, <hi>healing</hi>
their infirmities <hi>supplying</hi> their wants; <hi>performing</hi> unto them
all the <hi>conditions</hi> of the Covenant on his part.<note place="margin">Verse 15.</note> 
               <hi>What he hath
spoken with his mouth, he will performe it with his hand</hi> (as it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
in the next Verse.)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore let all our care and
solicitude be, how to performe the Conditions on our part.
How we may keep close to God, and walk before him. <hi>Walk
before me and be upright.</hi> This is that which wee have bound
our selves to by <hi>Baptisme,</hi> and confirmed in the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi>
And this is one main thing which wee are now to engage our
selves unto in <hi>this Covenant</hi> which wee are now to enter. So
much you shall finde in the Close of it, the <hi>last Article,</hi>
(which you may observe to be set forth in a <hi>different Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,</hi>
(as I conceive it) purposely to set a <hi>note of observation</hi>
upon it,) the summe whereof is <hi>Personal Reformation,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of our owne <hi>Hearts, Lives, Families.</hi> Now every
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56371:18"/>
of us (in the fear of God) have a speciall eye upon this, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon it in the <hi>first</hi> place, though here set <hi>last,</hi> beginning
our practice, where the Covenant ends (as it is the Rule of
<hi>Genesis,</hi> and <hi>Analysis).</hi> Every one beginning at and with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
each one <hi>indeavouring</hi> (as the words of the Article run)
<hi>to goe before another in the example of a reall Reformation.</hi>
Having practised upon <hi>our selves</hi> first; our owne <hi>Hearts,
Lives, Families;</hi> Then be we, as we may, all of us in our places,
and according to the opportunities offered us, subservient unto
the <hi>Publick</hi> indevouring to promote the great work of a <hi>Publick
Reformation</hi> of what is amisse in <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>State;</hi> which wee
are to doe, all of us by our <hi>Prayers;</hi> those that have abilities,
by their <hi>Purses;</hi> those which are called to it, by their <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels;
Magistrates</hi> by their <hi>Authority, Ministers</hi> by their <hi>Doctrine;
People</hi> by their <hi>Obedience.</hi> This doe we for the <hi>generall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Withall, having an eye to the severall <hi>particulars</hi> contained
in this Covenant, which may any wayes conduce unto that
great and blessed end, the <hi>establishment</hi> of the <hi>true Religion</hi> of
God amongst us, with the <hi>restoring</hi> and <hi>setling</hi> of a true <hi>peace,</hi>
and <hi>happinesse</hi> both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to that end let mee direct your eyes to three or foure
particulars of great consequence, tending directly to that end.
You find them altogether in foure words of the second <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,</hi>
where we engage our selves to endeavour the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(as of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Prelacy</hi>) two things obvious to every
eye;) so, of <hi>Vsurpation, Heresie, Schisme, Profaneness.</hi> Foure
words of great importance. Happily some of you do not so
cleerly understand the meaning of some of them. Give mee
leave to touch upon them a little, that you may both know
<hi>them,</hi> and your <hi>duty</hi> concerning them.</p>
            <p>1 <hi>Superstition, Wil-worship,</hi> when men shall worship God by
ways,<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 3, 6, 9.</note> and meanes of their owne devising; establishing their
<hi>owne Traditions, Teaching for Doctrines the commandments of men:</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:56371:19"/>
Introducing <hi>humane Inventions</hi> into the Room of <hi>Divine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,</hi>
making them either <hi>Pars</hi> or <hi>Medium,</hi> a <hi>Part</hi> or <hi>Means</hi>
of <hi>Divine Worship. Teaching,</hi> or <hi>practizing the fear of God by
the precepts of men.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioh. 29. 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> This is <hi>Superstition,</hi> whereof what ever
relicks may befound amongst us, and evidenced to be such,
we all stand obliged by vertue of this Covenant to seeke and
indeavour by lawfull ways and meanes the <hi>Abolition</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation</hi>
of them.</p>
            <p>The second and third wee may put them together (being
neer akin, <hi>Cosen German;) Heresie</hi> and <hi>Schisme:</hi> The one an
errour in <hi>Iudgment,</hi> the other in <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heresie. An erroneous opinion touching some Article and principle
of the Christiand aith, obstinately maintained against the evidence of the
word.</hi> This is properly <hi>Heresie</hi> to which there are these three
things required. 1. It must be an errour <hi>about some Article
of Christian faith,</hi> which is either <hi>of</hi> or <hi>neer</hi> the foundation.
2. It must be an errour <hi>evident to bee such by the light of the
Scriptures, and gtnerall consent of the Churches.</hi> 3. It must
be an errour <hi>obstinately maintained</hi> and pertinaciously held
<hi>after conviction</hi> and <hi>lawfull admonition.</hi> Put these together they
make up <hi>formall Heresie,</hi> Heresie properly so called. An <hi>evill
weed;</hi> not to be suffered in the Garden of God. One of those
<hi>workes of the flesh</hi> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of, <hi>Gal. 5. The
workes of the flesh are Heresies.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 20.</note> Of dangerous consequence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious,
not only to the <hi>person</hi> tainted with it but to the <hi>Church</hi>
wherein it is tollerated. An infectious evill <hi>spreading Gangrene</hi>
of a diffusive nature, very apt to spread and communicate it
selfe, insinuating it selfe into the breasts and bosomes of men,
for the most part, by way of fair and smooth <hi>pretences</hi> and
<hi>enticements.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 7. 4.</note> The <hi>Whore of Babylons Cup</hi> wherein shee giveth
her poyson to drinke, is a <hi>Golden Cup.</hi> In this respect (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
others) it is that <hi>Heresie</hi> is elsewhere in the <hi>Revelation</hi>
compared to <hi>whordome, Revel. 14. Those which follow the Lambe,</hi>

and purity of the <hi>Orthodox faith,</hi> that is <hi>virginity. Heresie</hi>
is <hi>whordome;</hi> A secretly enticing, sutablely seducing evill;
conveying it selfe (as <hi>poysons</hi> for the most part are) with
some <hi>sweete mixtures,</hi> the mixtures of some sweet and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>truths.</hi> And surely such are some of those <hi>Errours</hi> which
fly abroad in the world at this day. That (amongst other) of
<hi>Antinomianisme,</hi> which under a colour of <hi>exalting of Christ,</hi>
&amp; <hi>setting up free grace</hi> (the most glorious pretext in the world)
trample upon <hi>Moses,</hi> beating downe the <hi>Law,</hi> that Law
which <hi>Christ</hi> came to establish, not allowing it any <hi>directive</hi>
power, to be so much as a <hi>Rule of our obedience,</hi> withall, taking
away all <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>conscience</hi> of <hi>sin</hi> (as sin) in the <hi>Regenerate,</hi> An
<hi>Heresie</hi> of that dangerous consequence, that unlesse it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated,
and rooted out, it will endanger the eating out the
<hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>bowels</hi> of all true <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 <hi>Schisme.</hi> The word signifieth a <hi>Rending,</hi> a <hi>taring,</hi>
(<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) and it is nothing but a <hi>Rending and taring
of the Unity of the Church.</hi> As when men shall make <hi>divisions,</hi>
and <hi>factions</hi> in a Church, breaking it into pieces, and parts.
Such were those <hi>Schismes</hi> in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> (so the
Apostle calleth them, <hi>I beseech you brethren that there be no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
amongst you:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 10, 11, 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 1 Cor. 1. 10.</hi>

               </gap>, (saith the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,)
<hi>Schismes</hi>) where some were followers of <hi>Paul,</hi> others
of <hi>Apollos,</hi> a third of <hi>Cephas,</hi> a fourth of <hi>Christ;</hi> so break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the unitie of that <hi>body,</hi> that <hi>Church.</hi> Or when any shall
<hi>seperate</hi> from Communion with a true Church. Such a <hi>Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
(saith our Learned Doctor <hi>Ames) by a speciall appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
most rightly deserves the name of Schisme.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ames Cas.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Which yet must be warily and tenderly understood. Not
that every <hi>withdrawing</hi> from some particular <hi>act,</hi> or <hi>acts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> of
Communion with a Church, wherein men conceive that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56371:20"/>
they cannot participate without sin, should be presently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and accounted a <hi>Schisme.</hi> It was the Case of many of
late times in the point of <hi>Kneeling</hi> at the Sacrament: They
durst not hold communion with the Church in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>act,</hi> because of that <hi>Gesture,</hi> about which they were not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.
This <hi>partiall,</hi> and <hi>peaceable,</hi> withdrawing, meerly
out of <hi>tendernesse of Conscience,</hi> cannot properly be called
<hi>Schisme,</hi> so long as the <hi>Church</hi> still <hi>owned</hi> and <hi>acknowledged,</hi>
and communion held with it in the <hi>mayn.</hi> But, where there is
a <hi>totalis seccessio,</hi> a <hi>totall departure</hi> and <hi>Seperation,</hi> an absolute
renouncing and rejecting of all Fellowship and Communion
with a Church, a <hi>true Church,</hi> and that upon this ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they adjudge it to be <hi>no Church,</hi> or an <hi>imperfect</hi> and <hi>defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi>
Church; defective in her <hi>Constitution,</hi> or <hi>Administrations,</hi>
and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> Certainly; if there be any <hi>Schisme</hi> in the world
this is <hi>Schisme,</hi> and that most properly so called.</p>
            <p>An <hi>evilweed</hi> also, no lesse dangerous then the former. Some
comparing them together, <hi>Heresie and Schisme,</hi> have aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
this above the other,<note place="margin">Muscul. loc, Com.</note> as conceiving it to be the more
dangerous of the two.</p>
            <p>And surely dangerous it is, not onely to the <hi>person</hi> himselfe
who maketh this Schisme, who hereby</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1 Excommunicates himself,</hi> cuts off himself from Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and Communion with the Church and People of God;
depriving himself of <hi>Church-Priviledges,</hi> as also of the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Ordinances,</hi> the means of his <hi>Edification</hi> and <hi>salvation,</hi> to
which God hath promised a <hi>speciall concurrence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 Besides, <hi>running out of the fold,</hi> hee thereby exposeth
himself to the <hi>Wolfe.</hi> And hence it is that those which have
made such a totall <hi>seccession,</hi> and <hi>seperation,</hi> they seldom stay
there, but are carried on to further and more dangerous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
as to grosse <hi>Anabaptisme,</hi> and <hi>F<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ilisme,</hi> and what not?</p>
            <p>2 But dangerous also the <hi>Committie,</hi> to the <hi>Body of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56371:20"/>
Church,</hi> which by this means is rent and torn, and <hi>dismembred.</hi>
Which what it is to the <hi>Naturall body,</hi> what <hi>danger,</hi> and what
<hi>Torment,</hi> they which have felt it, can tell. I wish they which
stand guiltie of this evill were but as apprehensive and fensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of what it is to the <hi>mysticall body,</hi> how <hi>detrimentall,</hi> how
<hi>dangerous:</hi> What it is thus to <hi>divide Christ;</hi> thus to <hi>despise
and contemne the Church of God, (or despise yee the Church of God?</hi>
saith <hi>Paul</hi> to some of his <hi>Corinthians);</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 22.</note> A thing of sadder
Consequence, then I believe it is generally apprehended by
most of those; who upon every slight dislike, presently fall
to <hi>Partiall,</hi> and from Partiall to <hi>Totall Seperation.</hi> The Lord
heal these breaches.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, who ever they are that have taken, or
shall take this <hi>Covenant,</hi> let them take notice, how by vertue
hereof they stand ingaged to endeavour the <hi>Extirpation</hi> of
both these <hi>evill weeds, Heresie,</hi> and <hi>Schisme.</hi> A <hi>charge</hi> which
as it lyeth upon all, so after especiall manner upon <hi>publike
Persons, Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Ministers.</hi> If <hi>wee</hi> then speake against
both the one and the other, you must beare with us: It is no
more then we are bound to do. And if you that have <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
in your hands, do not improve it; for the suppressing, and
eradicating of both, see you to it, for my part I doe not see
how you can be acquitted of this <hi>Oath,</hi> wherein the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is so exprest, that you shall endeavour the extirpation as of
<hi>Heresie,</hi> so of <hi>Schisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The fourth and last is <hi>Prophanenesse.</hi> A bitter and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senous
weed. <hi>A Roote that beareth Gall and Wormewood</hi> (as you

               <hi>Deut. 29.</hi>) Such a <hi>Roote</hi> none will suffer to

joynt endeavour of all and every of us to pull it up, to roote
it out, <hi>Private</hi> persons, every one roote it out of his own,

               <hi>Families,</hi> not suffering it to grow within their <hi>walls.</hi> Every

it. <hi>Magistrates</hi> to root it out of their <hi>Iurisdictions,</hi> and that
by a <hi>due execution</hi> of the <hi>Laws</hi> upon publick offendours. Such
Laws you have divers; Laws against <hi>Swearing,</hi> against <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,</hi>
against <hi>Sabboth-breaking,</hi> &amp;c. all branches of the same
Root, <hi>Profanenesse.</hi> Now take ye notice of it, that this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
bindeth you to a more strict, and impartiall execution
of those Laws, then ever heretofore. Thus joining together,
<hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Sword, Ministers</hi> and <hi>Magistrates,</hi> there may be
some hope of extirpating of this <hi>bitter and deadly weed,</hi> which
hath <hi>overrun</hi> and almost overspread the whole <hi>Garden of God,</hi>
being so rife in every <hi>City,</hi> every <hi>Town:</hi> And that that being
extirpated, and rooted out, <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>true Religion</hi> may come
to put up head, and flourish. Which let it be the <hi>Ioynt desire,</hi>
