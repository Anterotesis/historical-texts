            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I make this

to you with ſome Confidence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am very willing and deſirous that you ſhould throughly examine, whether theſe neceſſities I mention be Real or Imaginary, or whether they are fallen upon Us by My fault, My own ill Managery, or Exceſſes, and provide for them accordingly. I am very willing that you make a full Inſpection into My Revenue, as well the Disburſements as Receipts; and if you finde it hath been ill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by any corruption in the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers I truſt, or by My own Unthrifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I ſhall take the Information and Advice you ſhall give Me very kindly; I ſay, If you finde it; For, I would not have you believe any looſe Diſcourſes, how confidently ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever urged, of giving away Fourſcore thouſand pounds in a Morning, and many other Extravagancies of that kinde.

Let Us not be diſcouraged, if We help one another, We ſhall with Gods bleſſing maſter all Our difficulties: Thoſe which concern Matters of Religion, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to you, are too hard for Me, and therefore I do commend them to your Care and Deliberation which can beſt provide for them. I ſhall

not need to recommend, or put you in minde of the good correſpondence that ought to be kept between you, for the good of your ſelves and Me, and the whole Kingdom; and I may tell you, It is very neceſſary for Us all: You will finde, whoever doth not love Me, doth not love you; and they who have no Reverence for you, have little kindneſs for Me. Therefore I pray let us adhere faſt to each other, and then We ſhall, with the help of God, in a ſhort time, perſwade, or oblige all men to that Submiſſion and Obedience to the Law, as may conſtitute a full meaſure of happineſs to Prince and People, and perſwade Our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors to that eſteem and value they have formerly had for Us.</p>
