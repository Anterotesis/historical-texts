            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Commands of Your Grace, as well as of Those other Honourable Assistants at the Consecration, having encouraged this Sermon to appear in publick; I have presumed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to set Your Venerable name before it, in order to give it Countenance and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation to all Good Men.

And yet I have one end more in this Address, and that is, That it may withal testifie to the World the just vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration I have for those mighty Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both of Nature and Grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God hath Blessed You, in order to bless his Church with the fruits and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of them,</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THEY are the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Apostle for whose Doctrine and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample we <hi>this day</hi> peculiarly give God thanks; They are his words to <hi>Timothy,</hi> whom, after he had planted the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> he did by the Laying on of his Hands Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate and appoint Bishop of that Church: Of which St. <hi>Paul, Theodoret</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">

               <hi>That he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise planted this Church of Ours</hi>: And if so, (Most Reverend Fathers) You bear a Relation to the <hi>very Hands</hi> in the Text, from which through a long and venerable Succession you derive your Authority; However, you bear an equal Relation to the Advice of the Text; and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101961:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Favour me therefore, I beseech you, while I make some Reflections upon it, with an Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as great as is my Unworthiness for such an Undertaking.</p>
            <p>The words do, 1. Offer to our Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion The Solemnity of Laying on of Hands, that Ancient Rite of Blessing by Prayer; and thence accommodated by Divine Authority to the Designing of Men to any peculiar Charge in the Service of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They offer to our Consideration the Charge or Office confer'd by this Solemnity, and that is the Office Episcopal; St. <hi>Paul</hi> Consecrating a Bishop and Investing Him with such Rights and Powers as we never find committed to a Simple Priest.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Person on whom hands were layd, <hi>Timothy,</hi> whose Character is given in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Verse, That He was a Man <hi>of unfeigned Faith.</hi> But these are Heads I shall not insist on; I shall only take occasion from them to bless God for the great Happiness and Glory of our Church, in the Legitimate Mission of Her Clergy; The Due Distinction of Her Orders; and the Virtue and Worthiness of Her Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: And in (that which, under Providence is the great occasion of all this) the Pious care of Her Sovereign Guardian the King; <hi>Whose
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101961:4"/>
eyes are upon such as are Faithful</hi>; Who, as God made choice of <hi>Ioshuah</hi> to lead the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites into <hi>Canaan,</hi> because he had dar'd, against the wishes of the People, to give a <hi>True Report</hi> of that <hi>Good Land</hi>; So He (by whom Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has designed to make us Happy, if we will be Happy) chooseth such to <hi>lead</hi> us, as by Their ardent Love and Zealous Contention to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, have given a True Report of the Desirableness of that Good Land: A Truth which, were it not for some few such Reports, the World lies always under a propension to distrust.</p>
            <p>I shall pass over these several Heads, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist only on the remaining matter of the words, and that is, the Gift confer'd on <hi>Timothy</hi> at his Consecration: <hi>Stir up the Gift of God that is in thee by the laying on of my Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The word here render'd, Gift, does, in its Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral sense, signifie any thing that God does gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously bestow upon Men; But in this place it signifies that which we more peculiarly call Grace, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Sanctifying Gift of God; and so the Fathers interpret it, or rather so our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle interprets himself in the following words; where he specifies the Gift he means to be <hi>The Spirit of Might, o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Love, and of a sound Mind.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101961:5"/>Grace then is the Subject; concerning which I propose these Three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To shew the Importance of it to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Practice.</item>
               <item>2. Its Distribution to Men and the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures thereof. And</item>
               <item>3. Mans Relative Duty towards it, in <hi>stirring of it up.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I begin with the Importance of Grace, to Christian Practice: All that I shall say thereon being designed to confirm this Proposition, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That the Grace of God is absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary towards the discharge of every mans Christian Duty.</p>
            <p>That there is a Sanctifying Principle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from Christ unto Believers preparing and assisting them to the fruits of Holiness, and therefore called <hi>the seed of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 9.</note> That this Principle is mo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e than all Natural Endowments, or any Improvements of Nature, that are meerly Human, and therefore called <hi>the Gift</hi>: That it is more than the Objective Influence of all Revealed Truths, or of all the outward Actings of Providence, and therefore called the <hi>Gift within Us</hi>: That this Principle is wrought in us by the Operation of the Holy Spirit, and therefore all Virtues are called the <hi>Works of the Spirit,</hi> and Christians the <hi>Temples of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101961:5"/>
Holy Ghost,</hi> are Truths that will appear to any indifferent Enquirer as evident as any that are written in the Book of God.</p>
            <p>And, it being the manner of the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures to bring down sublime Truths to our Understanding by familiar resemblances, and to convey them more strongly to our minds by the Images of sensible things,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 16. Col. 2. 19.</note> Our Apostle has in Two several places of his Epistles repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented this Communication from Christ to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers by the resemblance of those Spirits and Animal Iuyces that are communicated from the the Head to the several Members of our natural Body; from which Spirits every Member de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives its vigour, and sensation, and power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute those functions which are due to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon service; insomuch that if this influence from the head to any Member be casually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, that Member must necessarily languish and grow useless, and retain no more than the Figure of a part: And thus it is in the Mystical body of Christ, the Visible Church; There is a like variety and subordination of Members, some Eyes, some Hands, some Feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> some of more curious contexture and more noble Offices than others; but the Grace from the Head is the common Soul and animation of them all; insomuch that whosoever is any way obstructed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101961:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the participation of this Divine Influence, he must in the same proportion languish and fall off from his Duty, and degenerate into the bare figure of a Member of Christ.</p>
            <p>Thus the Holy Scriptures do instruct us in the Existence of Grace, as they do, (2.) In the necessity of it.</p>
            <p>And the necessity of Grace is founded in the Scriptures, upon Mans weakness and insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to do his own Duty: So our Saviour has laid down this Truth, as the first step to Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Wisdom,<note place="margin">St. Ioh. 15 5.</note> 
               <hi>(viz.) That without Him we can do nothing.</hi> For although it may undoubtedly appear from the lives, both of Heathens and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, That Man is not without a considerable Talent of Natural power to do Good; though it may be demonstrated, to the Reproach of Christian Professours, That <hi>All</hi> men <hi>may</hi> advance farther into the state of Goodness, by the bare conduct of Civil Prudence, and the force of such Resolutions as are meerly Human, than most Christians do arrive, amidst the great, but neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected advantages of Divine Grace: Yet when we consider that in Religion, it is not enough to do Good, unless it be done <hi>well</hi> in its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and <hi>Uniformly</hi> in its parts; when we consider that Religion is not satisfyed with <hi>many</hi> good Acts, no nor many Good Habits,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101961:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but only with an Integrity of Goodness, and equal respect to <hi>all</hi> that is commanded; when we consider that our Partial Understandings are never well reconciled to the Principal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Christianity, I mean the Duties of the Cross, but are apt to look upon them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

soundness of faculties, Happiness of Temper, a sober Education Choice of Imployments and Friends, the light of the Holy Scriptures, the prospect of future Punishments and Rewards, the opportunities of Religious Advices, and the Monitions of Providential Events, all these are mighty Graces of God in their kinds, and we speak of Men as living under the possible advantages of all these; and yet nevertheless when we consider (in ballance to these) How the Tempers even of the Best Men are not exempt from treacherous propensions to ill; How the Presence of things does work much more forcibly upon our Affections than any Reasonings about things distant can; How strong and delusive the Injections of Satan are, and how stupifying and deliriative every Act of Sin; How great a distance there is between keeping our selves from scandalous sins, and Raising our selves to the height of a fervent Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Resigned Will: When we consider how our Saviour, amidst all his Preaching and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,<note place="margin">St. Ioh. 6. 44.</note> crys our <hi>None can come to Me except the Father draw him,</hi> that is, He himself could not draw men as a Prophet, but only as a God; we must still conclude that, without this Inward Principle of Sanctification supernatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aiding us, <hi>we can do nothing.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:101961:7"/>'Tis true indeed, and we readily acknowledge, that there is an Obscurity fitting upon the face of this Dispensation of Grace: For we cannot <hi>feel</hi> the Impressions nor <hi>trace</hi> the <hi>footsteps</hi> of its <hi>distinct</hi> working in us: The Measures of our Proficiency in Goodness seem to depend entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon those of our Own Diligence; And God requires as much Diligence as if he gave no Grace at all: All this we acknowledge, and that it renders the Dispensation obscure: But then, on the other side, it is as plain That there is the same obscurity upon every dispensation of Gods Temporal Providence; and so there is no more Reason for doubting of the one than of the other. They that will not allow that God does by any inward efficacy confer a <hi>sound Mind,</hi> allow nevertheless that he gives Temporal good things; but how, in the mean time, does this Dispensation <hi>appear</hi> more than the former? For when God intends to bless a Man with Riches, he does not <hi>open Windows in Heaven,</hi> and pour them into his Treasure; he does not enrich him with such distinguishable Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences as that wherewith he water'd <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Fleece, when the Earth about it was dry; but he endows such a Man with Diligence and frugality, or else adorns him with such accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table qualifications, as may recommend him to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101961:8"/>
the opportunities of advancement, and thus his Rise to Fortunes, is made purely Natural, and the distinct working of God in it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: When God intends to deliver or enlarge a people, he does not thereupon destroy their Enemies, as he did once the Assyrians, by an Angel, or the Moabites by their own Sword; but he inspires such a people with a Couragious Virtue, and raises up among them Spirits fit to command, and abandons their Enemies to lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury; and softness, and so the method of their Raising, becomes absolutely Natural, and the distinct work of God in it does not appear: And, in the same manner, when God does by the inward Operation of his Grace promote a Man to Spiritual Good, and bring him to the state of undefiled Religion, he does not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon suddenly change the whole frame of his Temper, and chain up all the movements of his natural affections, and infuse into him such a System of Virtuous habits as may make him Good without application and pains; but he works his Spiritual work by a gradual process, and human methods; instilling into such a Man, first a considering mind, and then a sober Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and then a diligent use of all such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral means as conduce to the forming and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of every particular virtue: And now
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101961:8"/>
while God, in all these Instances does work in a human and ordinary way, and never supersedes the power of Nature, but requires her ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Actings, and only moves and directs, and assists her where she is weak, and incompetent for her work; both his Grace and his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are like a little spring, covered with a great Wheel, though they do all, they are not commonly seen to do any thing, and Man when he pleases to be vain and ungrateful may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute all Events to his own power and application. Now 'tis certain that God leaves this obscurity upon his Dispensations on purpose to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster an advantage and commendation to our Faith, not an opportunity or Argument to our Doubting; but yet if we will Doubt, the Case is plain, that we may as well doubt of any act of his Ordinary Providence as of his Sanctifying Grace; and so (by this method of Reasoning) God will have no share left him in the managment of the world.</p>
            <p>We allow again that there is another Obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon the face of this Dispensation; we know not the Philosophy of Sanctifying Grace; not unto what Class of Beings to reduce it, nor under what Modes to conceive its Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And this is a speculation that our Saviour himself argues us Ignorant of, as much as we
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101961:9"/>
are of the Issues and Retreats of the wind; and yet he thought fit to leave us so: Whether the knowledge of it were <hi>too Excellent</hi> for us; or whether it were too <hi>useless,</hi> as no way conducing to the ends of Practical wisdom: For we may observe of our Saviour, that in all his Discourses, he never entertained his Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with any Doctrine that was purely specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; because such kind of Knowledge is apt to make us more Vain than Wise: Had he led our Understandings through the whole Theory of Grace, we could not have accommodated it better to our uses, than an honest heart now can without any farther insight; No more than if he had stoopt to teach us the Philosophy of the Wind, any Mariner could have gathered it more commodiously into his Sheet. It is not then our Emulation to determine <hi>How</hi> the work of Sanctification is done; our only care is that it <hi>be</hi> done: We pretend not to <hi>declare,</hi> but thankfully to <hi>admire</hi>; By what Ray the Divine Grace opens and shines in upon our understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, clearing it from worldly prejudices and the impostures of Flesh, and rendring it Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, Considerative and Firm; By what Motion it inspires Good thoughts, excites good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, and suggests wholesome Counsels and Expedients; By what welcome violence it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101961:9"/>
draws our Wills, steers our Appetites, and checks our Passions; By what Heat it kindles Love and Resolution and Chearfulness of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours; By what Discipline it extinguishes sinful Imaginations and loose Desires; By what Power it aws the Devil, and foils Temptations, and removes Impediments, and strengthens and exhilarates amidst all difficulties; And finally, by what patient Art it turns, moulds, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms our stubborn Nature into new Notions, new Savours, new Powers, new Acts, new Aims, new Ioys; as if we were entirely new Creatures, and descended from another Race: All these effects do as well by their wonder as their Benefit render Grace, as our Apostle calls it, the <hi>Unspeakable Gift</hi>;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 9.15.</note> a Gift surmounting our Apprehensions as well as it does our Merit. That these <hi>are</hi> all the Esfects of Gods Grace we know, because he has declared them to be so; That they are so, we know, because many of them are wrought beside our Thinking, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny without our Seeking, and all beyond the reach of our too well Known and experienced infirmity; That they are so, we know, because their being so, comports best with the great end of all things, (that is,) the Glory of their Maker; For it tends much more to the Glory of the Mercy of God, to watch over and lead
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101961:10"/>
and assist Infirm Creatures than to have made them strong.</p>
            <p>And so I pass to my Second Head, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution of Grace unto Men and the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of it; The Doctrine whereof I shall form into this Proposition: (<hi>Viz.</hi>) That God distributes his Grace to every Man in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the measures of his Necessary Duty.</p>
            <p>God, who has laid our burden upon us, and commanded us to be strong, mocks us not; but so far as we are weak, offers us strength out of his own treasure, with this prospect, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it thence, we might behave our selves more reverently and thankfully under the sense of the Obligation. To every one therefore that considers his want, and values the supply, and applies himself for the Gift, with a worthy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and through appointed Means, God gives it liberally, and the measure of his giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to each, is that Rule of the Friend, St. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. <hi>As much as he needeth.</hi> For as Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has ordered a diversity of States in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life, producing a diversity of Duty; so the same Good Providence has ordained divers Sanctifying Gifts, and divers Measures of the same gifts to be distributed respectively among Men; that no man might Necessarily be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Duty of his particular state. The
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101961:10"/>
Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> (<hi>Cap.</hi> 11. 2.) Speaking of that fulness of the Spirit, that was to rest upon our Saviour, distributes the Holy Spirit (according to its operations) into <hi>the Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, the Spirit of Counsel and Might, the Spirit of Knowledge and the Fear o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Lord:</hi> Which the Church looks upon as a proper Enumeration of the Sanctifying Gifts of the Holy Spirit; which God does diversly distribute unto men, in order to the Common Salvation: There is <hi>Wisdom</hi> for those that Teach, and <hi>Understanding</hi> for those that Learn, and <hi>Counsel</hi> for such as are in Perplexity, and <hi>Might</hi> for such as are in Difficulty, and <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> for them that Err, and the <hi>fear of the Lord</hi> or <hi>Piety,</hi> (as other Versions read it) for all that will be Pious. Now of these Gifts God giveth such Kinds and Measures to every Man <hi>as he has need of</hi>: To every Private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so much as is necessary for a private Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to every one of a publick Character so much as is necessary to promote Salvation in the publick: Salvation of Souls, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Christs Kingdom being the only scope of all his Distributions. We may take an Instance of the whole, from our Bishop in the Text: He was a Good Man and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with Grace sufficient for a private Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101961:11"/>
before the laying on of Hands, as the foregoing Verse implies; but being now by that Sacramental Rite to enter upon a new Station of life, where greater measures of the Divine assistance were but necessary for the discharge of his duty, God confers greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of his Grace upon him through the same Rite; God confers (I say) both Grace and Duty through the same Rite, to put us in mind that they are Two things morally inseparable; For he that does more Duty shall have more Grace; and he that receives more Grace, receives an Obligation to do more Duty.</p>
            <p>But here it is of importance to observe the Restriction of the Proposition, I say it is <hi>Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> Duty to which God apportions the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of his Grace: Where by necessary Duty, I mean the Duty of that State or those Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, which Gods <hi>Providence</hi> does as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign us: For instance; If a man shall fall under an unavoidable perplexity of Wordly affairs, such a state does bring new Difficulties upon his Duty, and requires new measures of Grace to support him under it; and accordingly such a person may safely depend upon God for such measures: Or supposing a Man to want the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the happiness of Natural temper, and to lay under complexional indispositions to Virtue;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101961:11"/>
this state brings unavoidable difficulties upon his Duty, and requires greater Measures of Grace to be able to live well; and accordingly such a person may safely depend upon God for such measures: God Almighty taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to manifest the strength of his Grace in such opportunities of humane weakness: But, on the other hand; if a man shall affect such Difficulties, and run himself by choice into such Indispositions, such a one certainly brings a check upon the Divine assistance: For, in all the dispensations of Gods mercy the Wise Man's Rule is to be observed,<note place="margin">Wisd. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>That God is found of those that tempt him not.</hi> And so likewise in the Case of publick Charges, (which necessarily enlarge both the difficulty and the measures of human Duty) the Conduct of Providence is always to be regarded: We may safely <hi>follow</hi> Providence through any Difficulties; for there God <hi>shall be with us,</hi> and <hi>his right hand shall help us:</hi> But if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to Difficulties, as <hi>Ahab</hi> did to <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> onely directed by some false Prophet of our own Passions, we Tempt God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a reasonable assurance of finding him in our Undertaking. And this is the Reason why Pious Men, of all Ages, have trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the thoughts of <hi>seeking</hi> the Episcopal
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101961:12"/>
Charge; lest by running officiously into the obligation of a mighty Duty, they might tempt God and provoke him to withold that measure of Grace which was necessary for the due discharge of it. I know that Our Apostle has said;<note place="margin">3 Tim. 3. 1.</note> 
               <hi>If a man desire the Office of a Bishop, be desireth a Good Work</hi>; Imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it sometimes may lawfully be desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: And without doubt it has sometimes been so, and possibly may be so still: It was so in those Times when Persecution ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging against the Church fell always most severely upon her Bishops, When the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was accounted a Degree of Martyrdom, when there were no splendid advantages an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next to it, which might tempt the carnal affections of Men to regard <hi>them</hi> more than they did the Duty: At that time to desire it, was to deserve it: and a sufficient proof of an Inward Call or rather Animation to the Charge: But as soon as it came to be baited with Honours and advantages; then all Good Men became Iealous of themselves, lest in <hi>desiring the Office of a Bishop they might not so much desire a Good Work as a Good Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation</hi>; lest their Passions should draw them more prevalently than their Consciences: which must necessarily have brought a check
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101961:12"/>
upon the Divine Blessing; for the want where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no Parts, nor Wisdom, nor Industry in their Administration could ever compensate. From this pious Iealousie of theirs it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Greatest Bishops have been not only Wisht and Nominated, but Sought, Woo'd, and Commanded, out of their Retirement to the Undertaking of their Charge: Where, after they had Undertaken it, we find them bewailing themselves upon the Tremendous prospect of its duty,<note place="margin">St. <hi>August.

               </note> and <hi>Crying that it was in punishment to their sins, that God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Helm of a Diocess into their hands.</hi> Teaching the World what Caution is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, lest in a Charge of the most important service of God, where it is impossible for a Man to acquit himself well without Gods par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Blessing, and yet if he does not acquit himself well, the miscarriage must needs be damnable, any one should enter upon such a Charge, with any other Motives, than such as were conciliative of Gods Blessing and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2.16.</note> For <hi>Who is sufficient for these things?</hi> Says our Apostle; and having left the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on undetermined, he has left men under the obligation of a long suspense, before they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it in their own behalfs.</p>
            <p>But when God who makes those, whom
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101961:13"/>
he pleases, sufficient, shall determine it for any Man; then Compliance is safe, and the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing indubitable. And thus it was in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of our Bishop in the Text, upon whom this discourse is grounded; Of whom you may observe, that he had a Providential designati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Charge, before Hands were laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to Invest him in it: He had his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation <hi>from Prophecy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.14.</note> Says the Text, that is, from the declaration of the Holy Ghost through the Mouth of some inspired Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: Now, what was extraordinary in this Instance, and proper only for an Age of Miracles, we must not draw into Precedent; but from what was Ordinary in it we must form our Rule; and that Rule is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That when the Authority, to whom the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward care of the Church is committed by God, shall from the <hi>good Report</hi> of a Person, as of One <hi>of Unfeigned Faith,</hi> call such a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to the Charge, this is a Providential de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation; and such a Person going in the Conscience of his Duty, to the subsequent Rite of Laying on of Hands, needs not doubt of such an Effusion of Grace as shall enable him to give a cheerful account of his Duty: This only Caution being born in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, That the Grace so given must <hi>be stirr'd

up,</hi> Which is my third and last Head.</p>
            <p>The Original word signifies primitively the <hi>stirring up of Fire</hi>; Grace being sometimes, in the Scripture, compared to Fire; which, by reason of its properties of Lighting, Warming and Purging, bears a just Analogy to those Aids that Grace brings in to reform the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of each faculty of our Souls: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side these, Grace resembles Fire in another property, and that is, Unless it be <hi>stirr'd up,</hi> and blow'd, and Matter rightly apply'd, it will go out: The Natural Agency of the Fire, and the Moral Agency of Grace agreeing in this, That neither will serve our uses, unless we work with them. We may therefore receive the Heavenly <hi>gift in vain</hi>;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 1.</note> Nay the Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent do always do so; but if we stir it up by exercise and use, we make it spread and improve, and secure it's Aids to the full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing of our Duty.

               </gap>etionally to the same effect; the one acting out of Duty, and the other out of Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and both requiring mutual excitements, and mutual endeavours: Humane Diligence engages Grace; because it is not consistent with the Laws of Mercy, that they who are sincere, should miscarry for want of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101961:14"/>
and Grace engages diligence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not consistent with the Laws of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that they who are slothful should either succeed or be assisted. I shall exemplifie the Doctrine in the Instance of the Text. Where we are inform'd that <hi>Timothy</hi> at his Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration received a Gift or Effusion from the Holy Ghost; and this Effusion our Apostle distributes (in the following Verse,) into three particular Graces, all necessary for the discharge of the Episcopal Office, (<hi>viz.</hi>) <hi>Might, Love, and a sound mind:</hi> We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Soul was at that time touched with some supernatural Motion, that carried it forth in a strong ardor after these Episcopal Graces, and likewise that it was then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with such a Virtual power, as if stirr'd up, should render him eminent in the Practice of them: And now I will shew what <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> was particularly obliged to do in order to the stirring up of this His Gift; begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the first Branch of the Effusion, <hi>Might.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>Might</hi> here is meant no other than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious fortitude and Courage to do our Duty; the First Requisite of a Good Governour: Whence it is that we hardly meet with any Commissionated by God for any special ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101961:14"/>
but that he has this given him in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal charge, <hi>To be strong. To be Courageous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iosh. 1. 7. and 2 Chron. 18. 10.</note> Our Apostle-here opposes it to <hi>Fear</hi> or Pusil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity, that most Treacherous of all Vices; entangling Men into such necessities of sinning, that the <hi>Fearful</hi> are therefore set by St. <hi>Iohn</hi> in the head of all those <hi>who have their part in the Fiery Lake.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 8.</note> And now if <hi>Timothy</hi> will <hi>stir</hi> up this Spirit of Courage, he must (in the first place,) bethink himself well of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; He must imagine himself a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of War, enter'd into the Lists, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> heretofore into the Valley of <hi>Elah,</hi> where he must either Conquer or Die, not a single Man, but an Army: Both the Israelites and Philistines surveying him in the mean time, with different Hopes and Censures, whereof the most (as Envy will always have it) are against Him; Some blame his <hi>Youth,</hi> some his Confidence, some his want of Arms, and some (like <hi>Goliah</hi>) curse him by their Gods: But as these casual forms of popular breath cannot in themselves affect his Success, so neither must he suffer them to affect his Thoughts; he must wisely Keep them beneath his concern, while he composes his behaviour to the approbation of God, and rests in <hi>his</hi> Providence, whom he considers with awful

joy not to be a bare Spectator of what he does; but a <hi>helper and Deliverer, a Horn of Salvation and a Refuge</hi>; as that Royal Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion speaks him from experience in his own affairs. The next step is to bring his Courage into action; He must set himself to work, to check the Range of Satan in the World; to awe Men out of ill manners; to oppose Vice Vigorously and Impartially, without any glozing or fear of the Great, without any Unthankful Indulgence to Benefactor or Friend: He must awe it out of Countenance, and beat it off the Stage, with his Looks, Intimations, Discourses, Interests, Monitions, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes; and if it bear up head against all these, He must then separate the Leaper from the Camp, and turn the Sacred Key against the Refractory Sinner. And he that on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>is strong, God shall strengthen his heart:</hi>

from God is never mixt with Anger, it is always accompanyed and temper'd with <hi>Love</hi>; which is therefore the second Branch of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal Effusion. Advices, when without Love, seem only Reproaches, and Rebukes, Peevishness, and Censures, Tyranny; Like vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated Oyntments they have fum'd out all their healing qualities; and retain those only that fret and exasperate. And hence it has come to pass in the Church, that when that most aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Iudgment of Excommunication came to be executed in such manner and Circumstances, as that a great mixture of human Passions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the executing of it; The Censure lost its awe, and never reach't the Consciences of Men; and all the Terrour implor'd from the Secular Arm, could never make it otherwise, than more contemptible: Whereas when a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Godly Love, and a Paternal Commisera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appears at the head of such a Censure, it cannot but make the Correction sink deep into the Conscience, and make Men believe it to be (as it is) a <hi>Delivery unto Satan.</hi> And if <hi>Timothy</hi> will stir up this Divine Gift of Love, he must daily contemplate the value of <hi>all</hi> those for whom Christ died; He must espouse them into the Intimacy of his bosom, his Care, his Affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, his Provision, his Prayers; Considering

with himself what a mighty advantage he has from the height of his place to recommend and endear his Love; For Love in an Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our station may possibly look more mercenary, and so affect less; but Love condescending from such a height of place, wins and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates, and makes a Man look like God, both in Temper and Beneficence; Like God (I say) whose most amiable and endearing Character to the Sons of Men is this, That He is <hi>a Lover of Souls:</hi>
