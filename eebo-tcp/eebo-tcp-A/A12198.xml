            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>being drawen out of</hi> Satans <hi>kingdome, and within the Covenant of grace, whom</hi> Satan <hi>labours to unsettle and disquiet: being the</hi> God of the world, <hi>he is vexed to see men in the world, walke</hi> above <hi>the world. Since he cannot hinder their estate, he will trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their peace, and dampe their spirits, and cut a sunder the sinewes of all their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. These should take themselves to taske as</hi> David <hi>doth here, and labour to maintain their portion, and the glory of a Christian profession. For whatsoever is in God or comes from God, is for their comfort.</hi> Him selfe <hi>is the God of comfort; his</hi> Spirit <hi>most knowne by that office. Our blessed Saviour was so carefull that his</hi> Disciples <hi>should not be too much deiected, that he forgat his own bitter passion to comfort them, whom yet he knew would all forsake him:</hi> Let not your hearts be troubled <hi>saith he. And his owne soule was troubled to death, that we should not be troubled:</hi> whatsoever is written is written for this end; <hi>every article of</hi> faith <hi>hath a speciall influence in comforting a beleeving soule. They are not onely food, but cordials: Yea he put himselfe to his</hi> Oath, <hi>that we might not onely have</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation

Why doth hee sweeten our pilgrimage, and let us see so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny comfortable dayes in the world, but that we should serve him with cheerefull and good hearts? As for crosses, he doth but cast us downe, to raise us up, and empty us that hee may fill us, and melt us, that we may bee</hi> vessels of glory, <hi>loving us as well in the furnace, as when we are out, and standing by us all the while.</hi> We are troubled, but not distressed; perplexed, but not in <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts? How then can we let the reines of our affections loose to sorow without being inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi>

               <hi>What unthankfulnesse is it to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get our consolation, and to looke only upon matter of grievance: to thinke so much upon two or three crosses as to forget a hundred blessings? To suck poyson out of that, from which we should suck honey? What folly is it to straighten and darken our owne spirits? And indispose our selves for doing or taking good? A limbe out of ioynt can doe nothing without deformity and paine; deiection takes off the wheeles of the soule.</hi>

What a dishonour is it to Religion to conceive that God will not maintaine and honour his followers? as if his service were not the best service; what a shame is it for an heire of heaven to be cast downe for every pety losse and crosse: To bee afraid of a man whose breath is in his nos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trils,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>My discourse tends not to take men off from all griefe and mourning;</hi> Light for the righteous is sowen in sorrow: <hi>Our state of absence from the Lord, and living here in a vail of teares, our daily infirmities, and our sympathy with others, requires it; and where most grace is there is most sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness, as in Christ. But we must distinguish between griefe and that fullennesse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of spirit, which is with a repining and taking off from duty; when</hi> Joshua <hi>was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermuch cast down at Israels turning their backs before their enemies, God reproves him,</hi> Get thee up Joshua, why liest thou <note place="margin">Judg. 7. 10.</note> upon thy face?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some would have men after the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of grosse sinne to be presently comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and</hi> beleeve <hi>without humbling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at all; indeed when we ore once in Christ, we ought not to question our state in him, and if we doe, it comes not from the spirit: But yet a guilty conscience will be clamorous and full of obiections, &amp; God will not speake peace unto it till it be humbled. God will let his best children know what it is to be too bold with sinne, as we see in</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
<pb facs="tcp:23925:6"/>
               <hi>and</hi> Peter, <hi>who felt no peace till they had renued their repentance: The way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce</hi> with joy unspeakable and glorious, <hi>is to stirre up fighs</hi> that cannot be uttered. <hi>And it is so farre, that the knowledge of our state in grace should not humble us, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ingenuity co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidering Gods love to us, out of the nature of the thing it self workes sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and shame in us, to offend his Maiesty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>One maine stop that hinders Christians from reioycing, is, that they give themselves too much liberty to question their grounds of comfort and interest in the promises. This is wonderfull co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable say they, but what is it to me? the promise belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs not to</hi> me. <hi>This ariseth from want of giving all</hi> diligence <note place="margin">2 Pet. 10.</note> to make their calling sure <hi>to themselves.

               <hi>to stand out against comfort to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.

It makes us have comfortable and honourable thoughts of our selves, as too good for the service of any base lust, and brings confidence in God both in life and death.</hi>

               <hi>Here looke up to Gods infinite mercy in Christ, as we did at the first when we found no goodnesse in our selves, and that is the way to recover whatsoever we thinke wee have lost. By honouring Gods mercy in Christ, we come to have the Spirit of Christ; therefore when the waters of sanctification are troubled and muddy, let us runne to the witnesse of</hi> blood. <hi>God seemes to walke sometimes contrary to himselfe; he seemes to discourage, when secretly he doth incourage, as the</hi> woman of Canaan; <hi>but faith can finde out these wayes of God, and untie th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Againe, we must goe on to</hi> adde grace to grace. <hi>A growing and fruitfull Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, is alwayes a comfortable Christian; the oyle of</hi> grace <hi>brings forth the oyle of</hi> gladnesse. <hi>Christ is first a King of</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, <hi>and then a King of</hi> peace; <hi>the</hi>

Some degree of comfort fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes every good action, as heate accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies fire, and as beames and influences issue from the</hi> Sunne; <hi>which is so true, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Heathens <hi>upon the discharge of a good conscience, have found comfort and peace answerable; this is a reward before our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>

               <hi>Another thing that hinders the comfort of Christians is, that they forget what a</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gods designe in the covenant of grace, is to exalt the riches of his mercy, above all sinne and unworthinesse of man; and wee yeeld him more glory of his mercy by belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, then it would be to his Iustice to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy us.

As</hi> David <hi>therefore did acquaint himselfe with this forme of dealing with his soule, so let us, demanding a reason of our selves</hi> Why wee are cast downe; <hi>which will at least checke and put a stoppe to the distresse, and make us fit to consider more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid grounds of true comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of necessity the soule must bee somthing calmed and staid before it can be comforted. Whilest the humours of the body rage in a great distemper, there is no giving of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke: So when the soule gives way to passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is unfit to entertaine any counsell, therefore it must be stilled by degrees, that it may heare reason; and sometimes it is fitter to be moved with ordinary reason, (as being more familiar unto it) then with higher reasons fetcht from our supernaturall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Christ, as from the condition of mans nature subject to changes, from the uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of yeelding to passion for that, which it is not in our power to mend, &amp;c. these and such like reasons have some use to stay the fit for a while, but they leave the coar untouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed which is</hi> sinne, <hi>the trouble of all troubles. Yet when such considerations are made spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall</hi>

               <hi>by</hi> faith <hi>on higher grounds, they have some operation upon the soule, as the influence of the</hi> Moone <hi>having the stronger influence of the</hi> Sun <hi>mingled with it, becomes more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall upon these inferiour bodies. A candle light being ready at hand, is sometimes as use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as the Sun it selfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But our maine care should be to have</hi> Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall <hi>grounds of comfort, neere to us, as</hi> Reconciliation with God, <hi>whereby all things else are reconciled unto us,</hi> Adoption and Communion with Christ, &amp;c. <hi>which is never sweeter then under the Crosse.</hi> Philip Lansgrave <hi>of</hi> Hesse, <hi>being a long time pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner under</hi> Charles the fifth, <hi>was demanded what upheld him all that time, Who answered that</hi> hee felt the divine comforts of the Martyrs: <hi>there be</hi> divine comforts <hi>which</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Respondit, divinas consolatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum se sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisse.</note> 
               <hi>are felt under the</hi> Crosse, <hi>and not at other times,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Besides personall troubles, there are many much dejected with the present state of the Church, seeing the blood of so many Saints to be shed, and the enemies oft to prevaile; but God hath stratagems, as</hi> Joshua, <hi>at</hi> Ay; <hi>he seemes sometimes to retire that he may come upon his enemies with the greater advantage;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:23925:9"/>
               <hi>the end of all these troubles will no doubt be the ruine of the Antichristian faction; and we shall see the Church in her more perfect beauty; when the enmies shall be in that place which is fittest for them, the</hi> lowest, <hi>that is, the</hi> footstoole of Christ; <hi>the Church as it is highest in the favour of God, so it shall be highest in it selfe.</hi> The mountaine of the Lord shall bee exalted above all moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. <hi>In the worst condition, the Church hath two faces: One towards heaven and Christ, which is alwaies constant and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: Another toward the world, which is in appearance contemptible and changeable. But God will in the end give her beauty for ashes, and glory double to her shame: and she shall in the end prevaile; in the meane time, the power of the enemies is in Gods hand:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Robur ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stium apud Deum.</note> 
               <hi>The Church of God conquers when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered: even as our Head Christ did, who overcame by patience as well as by power. Christs victory was upon the Crosse. The Spirit of a Christian conquers, when his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is conquered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The way is, in stead of discouragement, to search al the promises made to the Church in these latter times, and to turne them into</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:23925:10"/>
               <hi>prayers, and presse God earnestly for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them. Then we shall soone find God both</hi> cursing <hi>his enemies, and</hi> blessing <hi>his people out of</hi> Zion, <hi>by the faithfull pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that ascend up from thence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In all the</hi> promises <hi>we should have spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall recourse to God in them. In all storms there is Sea roome enough in the infinite goodness of God, for faith to be carried with full saile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And it must be remembred that in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where God is mentioned, we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand God in the promised</hi> Messiah, <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified out so many waies unto us. And to put the more vigor into such places in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them, we in this latter age of the Church must thinke of God shining upon</hi> us <hi>in the face of Christ, and</hi> our <hi>Father in him. If they had so much confidence in so little light, it is a shame for us not to be confident in good things when so strong a light shines round about us; when we professe we beleeve</hi> a crowne of righteousnesse is laid up for all those that love his appearing. <hi>Presenting these things to the soul by</hi> faith, <hi>setteth the soule in such a pitch of resolution, that no discouragements are able to seise</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:23925:10"/>
               <hi>upon it.</hi> We faint not <hi>saith</hi> S. Paul, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he not faint? because</hi> these light and short afflictions procure an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding weight of glory.</p>
            <p>Luther <hi>when he saw</hi> Melancthon <hi>a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; learned man too much dejected for the state of the Church in those times, fals a chiding of him, as</hi> David <hi>doth here his own soule,</hi> I strongly hate those miserable <note place="margin">Ego miserri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas curas, quibus te consumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribis, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hementer odi.

               <hi>Now to speake something concerning the publishing of this Treatise. I began to preach on the Text about twelue yeares since in the</hi> City, <hi>and afterwards finished the same at Grayes-Inne.

               <hi>them to this forme: There is a pious and studious gentleman of Grayes-Inne, that hath of late published observations upon the whole</hi> psalme; <hi>and another upon this very</hi> verse <hi>very well; and many others by Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises of</hi> faith <hi>and such like, have furthered the spirituall peace of Christians much.

               <hi>reason of my absence, while the worke was in printing, some sentences were mistaken. Some will be ready to deprave the labours of other men; but so good may be done, let such ill disposed persons be what they are, and what they will be unlesse God turne their hearts: and so I commend thee and this poore Treatise to Gods blessing.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Psalmes</hi> are, (as it were,) the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy of a holy man which lay the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of a truely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour man outward to the view of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. If the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bee compared to a body, the <hi>Psalmes</hi> may well be the heart, they

are so full of sweet affections, and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For in other portions of Scripture God speakes to us; but in the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> holy men speake to God and their own hearts: as</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Psalme,</hi> we have <hi>the passionate passages of a broken, and a troubled spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time <hi>David</hi> was a banished man, banished from his owne house, from his friends, and which troubled him most, from the house of God, upon occasion of <hi>Sauls</hi> persecution, who hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him as a Partridge upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, see how this workes upon him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He layes open his desire springing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1.</note> 
               <hi>from his love.</hi> Love being the prime and leading affection of the soule from whence griefe springs, from being cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in that we love. For the setting out of which his affection to the full, hee borroweth an expressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the Hart, no Hart being chased by the hunters, <hi>panteth more after the waters,</hi> then my <note place="margin">verse 1.</note> heart doth <hi>after thee O God,</hi> though hee found God present with him in exile, yet there is a sweeter presence of him in his ordinances which now hee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23925:16"/>
and tooke to heart: places and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are happy or miserable, as God vouchsafeth his gratious presence more or lesse, and therefore; <hi>When, O when shall it bee, that I appeare before God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Then after his strong desire, <hi>hee</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2.</note> 
               <hi>laies out his griefe,</hi> which he could not containe, but must needs give a vent to it in teares: and he had such a spring of griefe in him, as fedde his <hi>teares day and night,</hi> all the ease he found was to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve <note place="margin">verse 2.</note> this could of grief into the showre of teares.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But,</hi> why gives he this way to his griefe? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Because together with his exiling <note place="margin">Answ.</note> from Gods house, he was upbrayded by his enemies, with his religion: <hi>where is now thy God?</hi> Grievances come not alone, <note place="margin">verse 3.</note> but (as <hi>Iobs</hi> messengers) follow one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. These bitter taunts together with the remembrance of his former happinesse in communion with God in his house, made deepe impressions in his soule, when he <hi>remembred how hee went with the multitude into the house of God,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">verse 4.</note> and ledde a goodly traine with him, being willing as a good Magistrate, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23925:17"/>
Master of a familie, not to goe to the house of God alone, nor to heaven alone but to carry as many as he could with him; Oh! the remembrance of this made him powre forth (not his words or his teares onely) but his very soule. <hi>Former favours and happinesse makes the soule more sensible of all impressions to the contrarie;</hi> hereupon finding his soule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sensible, he expostulates with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; <hi>Why art thou cast downe O my souls and why art thou disquieted within me? &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though the remembrance of the former sweetnes of Gods presence did somewhat stay him, yet his grief would not so be stilled, and therefore it ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon him againe; <hi>one griefe called</hi> 
               <note place="margin">verse 7.</note> 
               <hi>upon another,</hi> as one deep wave follows another without intermission, untill his soule was almost over whelmed under these waters; yet he recovers himselfe a little with looking up to God, who he expected would with speed and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie send forth <hi>his loving kindnesse</hi> with command to raise him up and comfort him, and give him matter of <hi>songs in</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:23925:17"/>
               <hi>the night.</hi> For all this, his unrulie griefe will not be calmed, but renues assaults <note place="margin">verse 8.</note> upon the returne of the reproach of his enemies. Their words were <hi>as swords</hi> unto him, and his heart being made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Vers. 10</note> tender and sensible of griefe, these sharp words enter too deepe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he hath recourse to his former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie (as being the most tryed) to chide his soule and charge it to trust in God.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Generall Observations upon the Text.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HEnce in generall wee may observe; that, <hi>Griefe gathered to a head will not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Obser. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>be quieted at the first.</hi> We see here passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons intermingled with comforts, and comforts with passions, and what bustling there is, before <hi>David</hi> can get the victorie over his owne heart: You have some short spirited Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that if they be not comforted at the first, they thinke all labour with their hearts is in vaine, and thereupon give way to their griefe. But we see in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:23925:18"/>
as distemper ariseth upon distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, so he gives check upon check, and charge upon charge to his soule, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till at length hee brought it to a quiet temper. In Physick if one purge will not carry away the vicious humour, then wee adde a second, if that will not doe it, we take a third. So should wee deale with our soules, perhaps, one check, one charge will not doe it, then fall upon the soule againe; send it to God againe, and never give over untill our soules be possessed of our soules againe.</p>
               <p>Againe, In generall observe in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Obser. 2.</note> spirit, that <hi>a gracious and living soule is most sensible of the want of spirituall meanes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reason is, because spirituall life <note place="margin">Reason</note> hath answerable taste, and hunger and thirst after spirituall helps.</p>
               <p>Wee see in nature, that those things presse hardest upon it, that touch upon <note place="margin">Acrius ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent quae necessitatis sunt, quam quae spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctant ad vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptutem.</note> the necessities of nature, rather then those that touch upon delights; for these further onely our comfortable being; but necessities uphold our being it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23925:18"/>
selfe: we see how famine wrought upon the Patriarks to go into Aegypt: Where we may see what to judge of those who willingly excommunicate themselves from the assemblies of Gods people, where the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are present, where the prayers of holy men meete together in one, and as it were binde God and pull downe Gods blessing: No private devotion hath that report of acceptance from heaven.</p>
               <p>A third generall point is, that <hi>a godly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Obser. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>soule by reason of the life of grace, knowes when it is well with it, and when it is ill, when it is a good day with it, and when a bad;</hi> when God shines in the use of meanes, then the soule is as it were in heaven, when God withdrawes himself, then it is in darknesse for a time. Where there is but onely a principle of nature without sanctifying grace, there men go plodding on and keep their rounds, and are at the end where they were at the beginning; not troubled with chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, because there is nothing within to be troubled; and therefore, dead means, quicke meanes, or no meanes, all is one
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23925:19"/>
with them, an argument of a dead soul. And so we come more particularly and directly to the wordes. <hi>Why art thou cast downe O my soule, and why art thou disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted within me? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words imply 1 <hi>Davids</hi> state <note place="margin">Parts.</note> wherein he was, and 2 expresse his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in that state.</p>
               <p>His estate was such that in regard of outward condition, he was in variety of <note place="margin">1.</note> troubles; and that in regard of inward disposition of spirit, he was first <hi>cast downe,</hi> and then <hi>disquieted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for his carriage of himselfe in this condition, and disposition, he dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <note place="margin">2.</note> roundly with himselfe: <hi>David</hi> reasoneth the case with <hi>David,</hi> and first checketh himselfe for being too much <hi>cast downe,</hi> and then for being too much <hi>disquieted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then layeth a charge upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <hi>to trust in God;</hi> wherein we have the duty he chargeth upon himselfe, which is to <hi>trust in God,</hi> and the grounds of the duty;</p>
               <p>First, from confidence of better times <note place="margin">1.</note> to come, which would yeeld him matter of <hi>praising God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:23925:19"/>
And then by a representation of God unto him, as a saving God in al troubles, <note place="margin">2.</note> nay as salvation it selfe, an open glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Saviour in the view of all, <hi>The salvation of my countenance,</hi> and all this enforced from <hi>Davids</hi> interest in God, <hi>He is my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence observe, first, from the state <note place="margin">Obser. 1.</note> he was now in, that <hi>since guilt and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath been derived by the fall into the nature of man, it hath been subjected to miserie and sorrow, and that in all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from the King that sitteth on the Throne to him that grindeth on the Mill.</hi> None ever hath beene so good or so great as could raise themselves so high as to be above the reach of troubles.</p>
               <p>And that choice part of mankind, the <note place="margin">1. Christ the Head was a man of many sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes.</note> first fruits and excellency of the rest (which we call the Church) more then others, which appeares by considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both of the <hi>Head,</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of the Church. For the <hi>Head</hi> Christ, he tooke our flesh as it was subject to miserie after the fall, and was (in regard of that which he endured) both in life and death, a man of sorrowes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:23925:20"/>
For the <hi>Body</hi> the Church, It may say from the first to the last as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 129. <note place="margin">2. The Church hath beene and is full of sorows.</note> 
                  <hi>From my youth up they have afflicted me.</hi> The Church beganne in blood, hath growen up by blood, and shall end in blood, as it was redeemed by blood.</p>
               <p>For the members, they are all predes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate to a conformitie to Christ their <note place="margin">3. The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church have been and are ful of crosses.</note> Head, as in grace and Glory, so in abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. neither is it a wonder, for those that are born soldiers to meet with conflicts, for travailers to meete with hard usage, for seamen to meete with storms, for strangers in a strange country (especially amongst their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) to meete with strange entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>A Christian is a man of another world, and here from home, which hee would forget (if he were not exercised here) and would take his passage for his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But though all Christians agree and meete in this, that <hi>through many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions we must enter into heaven:</hi> Yet, <note place="margin">Acts 14. 22.</note> according to the diversity of place, parts and grace, there is a different cup measured to every one.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:23925:20"/>
And therefore it is but a plea of the flesh, to except against the Crosse, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Vse.</note> 
                  <hi>was poore creature distressed as I am:</hi> this is but selfe-love, for was it not the case both of Head, Body and members, as we see here in <hi>David</hi> a principall member? When hee was brought to this case, thus to reason the matter with himselfe, <hi>Why art thou cast downe (O my soule) and why art thou disquieted within me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the frame of <hi>Davids</hi> spirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these troubles, wee may observe, <note place="margin">Obser. 2.</note> that, as the case is thus with all Gods people, to be exercised with troubles, so, <hi>They are sensible of them oftentimes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to casting downe and discouraging.</hi> And the reason is, they are flesh and <note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> blood subject to the same passions, and made of the same mould, subject to the same impressions from without as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men; And their nature is upheld <note place="margin">2.</note> with the same supports and refreshings as others, the withdrawing and want of which affecteth them. And besides those troubles they suffer in Common with other men, by reason of their new
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:23925:21"/>
advancement and their new dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they have in and from Christ their Head, they are more sensible in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <note place="margin">3.</note> maner of those troubles that any way touch upon that blessed condition, from a new life they have in and from Christ, which will better appeare if we come more particularly to a discovery of the more speciall causes of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, some of which are, 1 <hi>Without us.</hi> 2 <hi>Some within us.</hi>

The child of God when hee seeth that his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are mixed with Gods displeasure, and perhaps his conscience tells him that God hath a just quarrell against
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23925:21"/>
him, because he hath not renewed his peace with his God, then this anger of <note place="margin">A divine temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what.</note> God puts a sting into all other troubles, and addes to the disquiet. There were some ingredients of this divine tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as wee call it) in holy <hi>David</hi> at this time: though most properly a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine temptation bee, when God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares unto us as an enemy, without any speciall guilt of any particular sin, as in <hi>Iobs</hi> case.</p>
               <p>And no marvaile if Christians bee from hence disquieted, when as the Sonne of God himselfe having alwayes before enjoyed the sweet communion with his Father, and now feeling an estrangement, that he might be a curse for us, complained in all his torments of nothing else; but <hi>My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> It is with the <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 46</note> godly in this case, as with vapours drawne up by the Sunne, which (when the extracting force of the Sunne leaves them) fall downe againe to the earth from whence they are drawn. So when the soule, raised up and upheld by the beames of his countenance, is left of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23925:22"/>
God, it presently begins to sinke. We see when the body of the Sun is partly hid from us (for totally it cannot in an Eclipse by the body of the Moone) that there is a drouping in the whole frame of nature: so it is in the soule, when there is any thing that comes between Gods gracious countenance and it.</p>
               <p>Besides, if we looke downe to infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour causes, the soule is oft cast down <note place="margin">2.

For being a cursed spirit, cast and tumbled downe himself from heaven, where hee is never to come againe, is hereupon full of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, carying a hell about himselfe, whereupon all that he labours for, is to cast downe and disquiet others, that they may bee (as much as he can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure) in the same cursed condition with himselfe. He was not ashamed to set upon Christ himselfe with this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pration of casting downe, and thinke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>By his envy and subtlety, wee were <note place="margin">The devill envies our happinesse first, and last.</note> driven out of Paradice at the first, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23925:22"/>
now hee envies us the Paradice of a good conscience: for that is our Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice untill wee come to heaven; into which no serpent shall ever creepe to tempt us. When Satan seeth a man strongly and comfortably walke with God, he cannot endure that a creature of meaner ranke by creation then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, should enjoy such happinesse. Herein, like (some peevish men which are his instruments) men too contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and bred up therein (as a Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the fire,) who when they know the cause to be naught, and their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries to have the better title; yet (out of malice) they will follow them with suits and vexations, though they be not able to disable their opposites title: If their malice have not a vent in hurting some way, they will burst for anger.</p>
               <p>It is just so with the devill, when he seeth men will to heaven, and that they have good title to it, then he followes them with all dejecting and uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table tentations that he can: it is his continuall trade and course to seek his rest in our disquiet, he is by beaten pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise

               <p>Againe, what Satan cannot doe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe by immediate suggestions, that <note place="margin">3. Satans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, who are al for casting dovvne.</note> he labours to work by his instruments, who are all for casting down of those who stand in their light, as those in the Psalme who cry, <hi>downe with him, downe with him, even to the ground;</hi> a character and stamp of which mens dispositions, we have in the verse before this text, <hi>Mine enemies</hi> (saith <hi>David) reproach me.</hi> As sweet and as compassionate a man as hee was, to <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>put on sackcleth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psa. 35. 13.</note> for them, yet he had enemies, and such <hi>enemies,</hi> as did not suffer their malice only to boile and concoct in their own breasts, but out of the abundance of their hearts, they reproached him in words. There is nothing the nature of man is more impatient of, then of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches; for there is no man so meane, but thinkes himselfe worthy of some regard, and a reproachfull scorn shews an utter disrespect, which issues from the very superfluity of malice.</p>
               <p>Neither went they behind his back,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23925:23"/>
but were so impudent to say <hi>it to his face:</hi> a malicious heart and a slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tongue goe together, and though shame might have suppressed the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of such words, yet their inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent cariage spake as much <hi>in Davids</hi>

                  <hi>heart:</hi> We may see by the language of mens cariage what their heart saith, and what their tongue would vent, if they dared.</p>
               <p>And this their malice <hi>was unwearied,</hi> for they said <hi>daily</hi> unto him, as if it had beene fed with a continuall spring: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice is an unsatiable monster, it will mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister words, as rage ministers weapons. But what was that they said so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully? and said daily? <hi>Where is</hi>

Where we see that the scope of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and wicked men is to shake the godlies Faith and confidence in their God. As Satan laboured to divide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Christ and his Father. <hi>If thou</hi>

They had some colour of this, for God at this time had vailed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from <hi>David,</hi> as hee does oft from his best children for the better discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the malice of wicked men: And <note place="margin">This was preached in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Church.</note> doth not Satan tippe the tongues of the enemies of Religion now, to insult over the Church now lying a bleeding? <hi>What becomes of their Reformation, of their Gospell?</hi> Nay, rather whats become of your eyes, we may say unto them? For God is nearest to his children when hee seemes furthest off. <hi>In the mount of the Lord it shall be seene,</hi> God is <note place="margin">Gen. 22. 14.</note> with them and in them, though the wicked be not aware of it; it is all one, as if one should say betwixt the space of the new and old Moone, where is now the Moone? when as it is never nearer the Sun then at that time.</p>

               <p>But how was <hi>David</hi> affected with these reproaches? their words were as swords, <hi>as with a sword in my bones, &amp;c.</hi> they spake daggers to him, they cut <note place="margin">Vers. 10</note> him to the quicke when they toucht him in his God, as if he had neglected his servants, when as the devill himself regards those who serve his turn; touch a true godly man in his Religion, and you touch his life and his best freehold, he lives more in his God then in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; so that we may see here, there is a murther of the tongue, a wounding tongue as well as a healing tongue: men think themselves freed from mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">A murther of the tongue.</note> if they kill none, or if they shed no blood, whereas they cut others to the heart with bitter words. It is good
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23925:25"/>
to extend the Commandement to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake the conscience the more, and breed humility, when men see there is a murdering of the tongue. Wee see <hi>David</hi> therefore upon this reproach to be presently so moved, as to fall out with himselfe for it, <hi>Why art thou so cast down and disquieted ô my soule?</hi> This bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taunt ran so much in his minde, that he expresseth it twice in this Psalme; He was sensible that they struck at God, through his sides; what they spake in scorne and lightly, hee tooke heavily. And indeed, when religion suffers, if there be any heavenly fire in the heart, it will rather break out, then not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it selfe at all. We see by daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that there is a speciall force in words uttered from a subtle head, a false heart, and a smooth tongue, to weaken the hearts of professors, by bringing an evill report upon the strict profession of religion: as the <hi>cunning</hi> and false <hi>spies</hi> did upon <hi>the good land,</hi> as if it were not onely in vaine, but dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous <note place="margin">1 Iudg. 24.</note> to appeare for Christ in evill times.

by it selfe reflecting upon it selfe the light of faith discovering both it selfe, and other things, or by the cause of it, or by the effect, or by all; Faith is oft more knowne to us in the fruit of it, then in it selfe, as in plants the fruits are more apparant then the sappe and roote. But the most setled knowledge is from the cause, as when I know I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, because in hearing Gods graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promises opened and offered unto me, the spirit of God caryeth my soule to cleave to them as mine owne porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 13.</note> Yet the most familiar way of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our estates is from the effects to gather the cause, the cause being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes more remote and spirituall, the effects more obvious and visible. All the vigour and beauty in nature which we see, comes from a secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from the heavens which we see not; In a cleare morning we may see the beames of the Sun shining upon the top of hils and houses before wee can see the Sun it selfe.</p>
               <p>Things in the working of them, doe issue from the cause, by whose force

they had their being; but our knowing of things ariseth from the effect, where the cause endeth; wee know God must love us before wee can love him, and yet we oft <hi>first</hi> know that <hi>we love him;</hi> the love of God is the cause why wee <note place="margin">1 Iohn 4. 19.</note> love our brother, and yet we know we love <hi>our brother whom we see</hi> more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>then God whom we doe not see.</hi>

               <p>It is a spirituall peevishnesse that keepes men in a perplexed condition, that they neglect these helps to judge of their estates by, whereas God takes liberty to help us sometime to a disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of our estate by the effects, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the cause, &amp;c.

neglect the cleansing of their natures; and ordering of their lives: yet in time of temptation, they will finde it more troublesome then they thinke. For a conscience guilty of many neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects and of allowing it selfe in any sin to lay claime to Gods mercy, is to doe as we see mountebanks sometimes do, who wound their flesh to try conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon their owne bodies how sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne the salve is; yet oftentimes they come to feele the smart of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, by long and desperate wounds.

And though (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) with much wrastling with God, they may get assurance of the pardon of their sins, yet their conscience will bee still trembling (like as <hi>Davids</hi> though <hi>Nathan</hi> had pronounced unto <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> him the forgivenesse of his sin) till God at length speakes further peace, even as the water of the sea (after a storme) is not presently still, but moves and trembles a good while after the storm

A Christian life is full of duties, and the peace of it is not maintained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much fruitfulnesse and looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us: debt is a disquieting thing to an honest minde, and <hi>duty is debt.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <note place="margin">Rom. 13 8</note> the Apostle layeth the charge, <hi>that we should owe nothing to any man, but love.</hi>

that hath alwayes its religion, and its way to choose. Uncertaine men are alwayes unquiet men, and giving too much way to passion maketh men in particular consultations unsetled. This is the reason why in particular cases when the matter concernes our selves, we cannot judge so clearely as in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall truths, because Satan raiseth a mist between us and the matter in question.

Whence, wee see 1. that casting downe breeds disquieting: Because it <note place="margin">Obser. 1.</note> springs from pride, which is a turbulent Passion, when as men cannot stoope to <note place="margin">Reason.</note> that condition which God would have them in; this proceeds from discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and that from pride. As we see, a vapour inclosed in a cloude cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a terrible noise of thunder, whilst it is pent up there, and seeketh a vent; So all the noise within proceeds from a discontented swelling vapour. It is aire inclosed in the bowels of the earth which shakes it, which all the foure windes cannot doe.</p>
               <p>No creature under heaven so low cast downe as Satan, none more lifted up in pride, none so full of discord; the impurest spirits are the most disquiet and stormy spirits, troublesome to themselves and others; for when the soule leaves GOD once, and lookes downewards, what is there to stay it from disquiet; remoove the needle from the pole starre, and it is alwaies stirring and trembling, never quiet till it be right againe. So displace the soule

waies of God, bringing an ill report upon religion, causing men to charge it falsly for an unco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable way, whenas men never feele what true comfort meaneth, till they give up themselves to God. And it dampes likewise the spirits of those that walk the same way with us, when as wee should (as good travellers) cheere up one another both by word and example. In such a case, the wheeles of the soule are taken off, or else, (as it were) want oyle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the soule passeth on very heavily and no good action comes off from it as it should, which breeds not onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortablenesse, but unsettlednesse in good courses. For a man will never go on comfortably and constantly in that which he heavily undertakes. Thats the reason why uncheerefull spirits sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hold out as they should. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> knew this well, and therefore he willeth that there should be <hi>quietnesse and peace betwixt husband and wife, that their prayers be not hindred;</hi> Insinuating <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.</note> that their prayers are hindered by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily breaches. For by that meanes,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:23925:41"/>
those two (that should be one flesh and spirit) are divided, and so made two, and when they should minde duty, their minde is taken up with wrongs done by the one to the other.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more required for the performing of holy duties then u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting of spirits, and therefore God would not have the sacrifice brought to the altar, before reconciliation with <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 24.</note> our brother. He esteemes peace so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he will have his owne service stay for it. We see when <hi>Moses</hi> came to <note place="margin">Exodus 9.</note> deliver the <hi>Israelites out of bondage,</hi> their minde was so taken up with their griefe, that there was no body within to give <hi>Moses</hi> an answere, their soules went altogether after their ill usage.</p>
               <p>Therefore we should all endeavour <note place="margin">Vse.</note> and labour for a calmed spirit, that we may the better serve God in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, and praising of him; and serve one another in love, that we may be fitted to doe and receive good: that wee may make our passage to heaven more easie and cheerefull, without drooping and hanging the wing. So
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:23925:41"/>
much as wee are quiet and cheerefull upon good grounds, so much we live, and are as it were in heaven. So much as we yeeld to discouragement, we lose so much of our life and happinesse, cheerefulnesse being (as it were) that life of our lives, and the spirit of our spirits by which they are more inlarged to receive happinesse and to expresse it.</p>

               <p>BUt to come to some helpes.</p>
               <p>First, in that hee expostulates with himselfe, wee may observe, that, <hi>One way to raise a dejected soule is, to cite it before it selfe, and as it were to reason</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Obser. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>the case.</hi> God hath set up a court in mans heart, wherein, the conscience hath the office, both of <hi>Informer, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, witnesse,</hi> and <hi>judge;</hi> And if matters <note place="margin">The court of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in man.</note> were well caryed within our selves, this prejudging would be a prevention of future judging. It is a great mercy
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:23925:42"/>
of God, that the credit and comfort of man are so provided for, that hee may take up matters in himselfe, and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent publike disgrace. But if there be not a faire dispatch and transaction in this inferiour court within us, there will bee a review in a higher court. Therefore by slubbering over our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <note place="margin">Iudgement must passe first or last without or within up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</note> we put God and our selves to more trouble then needs. For a judgement must passe first, or last, either within us or without us, upon all unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble distempers. We must not onely be ready to give an account of our <hi>faith,</hi> upon what Grounds we beleeve, but of all our <hi>actions,</hi> upon what grounds wee doe what wee doe, and of <hi>our Passions,</hi> upon what ground we are passionate, as in a well governed state, uprore and sedition is never stirred, but account must be given. Now in a mutiny the presence and speech of a venerable man, composeth the mindes of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered multitude, so likewise in a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny of the spirit, the authority that God hath put into reason (as a beame of himselfe) commands silence, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:23925:42"/>
puts all in order againe.</p>
               <p>And there is good reason for it, for man is an understanding creature, and <note place="margin">Reason</note> hath a rule given him to live by, and therefore is to be countable of every <hi>thought, word, action, passion.</hi> Therefore the first way to quiet the soule, is, to <note place="margin">Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers fall downe, when they are arrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> aske a reason of the tumult raised, and then many of our distempers for shame will not appeare, because (though they rage in silent darknesse) yet they can say nothing for themselves, being sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned before strength of judgement and reason. Which is the reason why passionate men are loath that any court should be kept within them; but labour to stop judgement all they can. If men would but give themselves leave to <note place="margin">Want of considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, raises and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines our distempers</note> consider better of it, they would never yeeld to such unreasonable motions of the soule: If they could but gaine so much of their unruly passions, as to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the matter within themselves, to heare what their consciences can tell them in secret, there would not be such offensive breakings out. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if we be ashamed to heare others

Fiftly, there is yet a further degree of conflict betwixt the sanctified pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the soule, and the flesh, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">5.</note> as it is seated in the baser parts, but even in the best faculties of the soule, and as it mingles it self with every gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious performance; (as in <hi>David)</hi> There is not onely a conflict betwixt sin and conscience, inlightned by a <hi>common worke</hi> of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> but betweene the commanding powers of the soule <hi>san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,</hi> and it selfe <hi>unsanctified,</hi> between reasons of the <hi>flesh</hi> and reasons of the <hi>spirit,</hi> betweene <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>distrust,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the true light of knowledge, and false light.

                  <p>Difference between good men and others in conflicts with sinne.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt how doth it appeare that this combate in <hi>David</hi> was a <hi>spirituall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Quest.</note> combate?</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Answ.</hi> First, A naturall conscience is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for sins against the light of <hi>nature</hi> onely, but <hi>David</hi> for inward and secret corruptions, as discouragement and disquietnesse arising from faint trusting in God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Davids</hi> conflict was not onely with the sensuall lower part of his soule,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:23925:58"/>
which is carried to ease and quiet, and love of present things, but hee was troubled with a mutiny in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, betweene <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>distrust;</hi> and therefore hee was forced to rouze up his soule so oft to <hi>trust</hi> in <hi>God;</hi> which shews that carnall reason did solicite him to discontent, and had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny colourable reasons for it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a man indued with <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2.</note> grace, is rather a patient then an agent in conflicts; the <hi>light</hi> troubles him against his will, as discovering and reproving him, and hindring his sinfull contentments; his heart is more bya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed another way if the <hi>light</hi> would let him; but a godly man labours to helpe the <hi>light,</hi> and to worke his heart to an opposition against sinne; he is an agent as well as a patient. As <hi>David</hi> here doth not suffer disquieting, but is <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted</hi> with himselfe for being so. A godly man is an <hi>agent</hi> in opposing his corruption, and a <hi>patient</hi> in induring of it: whereas a naturall man is a secret <hi>agent</hi> in and for his corruptions, and a <hi>patient</hi> in regard of any helpe against
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:23925:58"/>
them; A good man suffers evill and doth good, a naturall man suffers good and doth evill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A conscience guided by <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                  <hi>common</hi> light, withstands distempers most by outward meanes, but <hi>David</hi> here fetcheth helpe from the Spirit of <hi>God</hi> in him, and from trust in <hi>God.</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture works from within, so doth the new nature; <hi>David</hi> is not onely some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>disquieted,</hi> and something trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for being disquieted, but sets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe throughly against his distempers; hee complaines, and expostulates, hee censures, and chargeth his soule. The other, if hee doth any thing at all, yet it is faintly; he seeks out his corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a coward doth his enemie, loth to finde him, and more loth to encounter with him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>David</hi> withstands sinne <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                  <hi>constantlie</hi> and gets ground. Wee see here, he gives not over at the first, but presseth againe and againe. Nature works constantly, so doth the new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The conflict in the other is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing forced, as taking part with the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:23925:59"/>
worser side in himselfe, good things have a weak, or rather no party in him, bad things a strong; and therefore hee soone gives over in this holy quarrell.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>David</hi> is not discouraged by his foiles, but sets himselfe afresh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">5.</note> his corruptions, with confidence to bring them under. Whereas he that hath but a <hi>common</hi> work of the Spirit, after some foiles, lets his enemy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile more and more, and so despaires of victory, and thinks it better to fit still, then to rise and take a new fall; by which meanes his later end is worse then his beginning, for <hi>beginning in the Spirit, he ends in the flesh.</hi> A godly man, although upon some foile, he may for a time bee discouraged, yet by holy indignation against sinne, he renues his force, and sets afresh upon his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and gathers more strength by his falls, and groweth into more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with his owne <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>Satans</hi> malice, and Gods strange waies in bringing light out of darknesse.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, An ordinary Christian may <note place="margin">6.</note> be disquieted for being disquieted, as
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:23925:59"/>
                  <hi>David</hi> was, but then it is onely as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet hath vexation in it; but <hi>David</hi> here striveth against the unquietnesse of his spirit, not onely as it brought vexation with it, but as it hindred com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with his God.</p>
               <p>In sinne there is not onely a <hi>guilt</hi> binding over the soule to Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and thereupon filling the soule with inward feares and terrors; but in <note place="margin">Evils of sinne.</note> sinne likewise there is, 1. a contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">1.</note> to <hi>Gods</hi> holy nature; and, 2. a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety <note place="margin">2.</note> to the Divine nature and image stamped upon our selves; 3. a <note place="margin">3.</note> weakning and disabling of the soule from good; and, 4. a hindring of our former communion with GOD, sinne <note place="margin">4.</note> being in its nature a leaving of God the fountaine of all strength and comfort, and cleaving to the creature; hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the soule having tasted the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of GOD before, is now grieved, and this grief is not onely for the guilt and trouble that sinne drawes after it, but from an inward Antipathy and contrariety betwixt the sanctified soule and sinne. It hates sinne as sinne, as the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:23925:60"/>
onely bane and poyson of renewed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the onely thing that breedes strangenesse betwixt God &amp; the soule. And this hatred, is not so much from discourse and strength of reason, as from nature it selfe rising presently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst its enemie; The <hi>Lambe</hi> present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shuns the <hi>Wolfe</hi> from a contrariety; Antipathies wait not for any strong reason, but are exercised upon the first presence of a contrary object.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, hereupon ariseth the last difference; that because the soule ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note place="margin">7</note> sinne as sinne, therefore it oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it universally and eternally, in all the powers of the soule, and in all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons inward and outward issuing from those powers, <hi>David regarded no ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in his heart, but hated every evil</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 66. 18</note> 
                  <hi>way.</hi> The desires of his soule were, <hi>that it might be so directed, that he might keep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>of God cannot sinne,</hi> that is so farre forth as he is <hi>borne of God;</hi> his <hi>new</hi> nature will not suffer him, he cannot lie, he cannot deceive, he cannot be earthly minded, hee cannot but love and delight in the persons &amp; things that are good. There is not onely a light in the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but a new life in the will, and all other faculties of a godly man; what good his knowledge discovereth, that his will makes choice of, and his heart loveth; What ill his understanding dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers, that his will hateth and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staines from. But in a man not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converted, the will and affections are bent otherwise, he loves not the good he doth, nor hates the evill hee doth not.</p>
               <p>Therefore let us make a narrow search into our soules upon what <note place="margin">Vse.</note> grounds wee oppose sinne, and fight <hi>Gods</hi> battells. A common Christian is not cast downe, because hee is disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Gods service, or for his inward failings, that he cannot serve God with that liberty &amp; freedome he desires, &amp;c: But a godly man is troubled for his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:23925:61"/>
because they hinder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable intercourse betwixt God and his soule, and that spirituall composed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and Sabbath of spirit which hee enjoyed before, and desires to enjoy againe. Hee is troubled that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his soule are troubled so, that the image of Christ shines not in him as it did before. It grieves him to finde an abatement in affection, in love to God, a distraction or coldnesse in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming duties, any doubting of Gods favour, any discouragement from du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp;c. A godly mans comforts and grievances are hid from the world; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall men are strangers to them. Let this be a rule of discerning our estates, how wee stand affected to the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of our hearts; If wee finde them troublesome, it is a ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto us that our <hi>Spirits</hi> are ruled by a <hi>higher spirit;</hi> and that there is a principle of that life in us, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not brooke the most secret corruption, but rather casts it out by a holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, as strength of nature doth poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which seekes its destruction. And
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:23925:61"/>
let us bee in love with that worke of grace in us, which makes us out of love with the least stirrings that hinder our best condition.</p>

                  <p>The spirit of man is like unto moist elements, as ayre and water, which have no bounds of their owne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them in, but those of the vessell that keepes them: water is spilt and lost without something to hold it; so it is with the spirit of man, unlesse it be bounded with the Spirit of God.

yet we may looke too much, and too long upon it, for the soule hath a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eye, one to looke to sinne, another to looke up to Gods mercy in Christ. Having two objects to looke on, wee may sinne in looking too much on the one, with neglect of the other.</p>

                  <p>Griefe is ill when it taketh off the soule from minding that it should, and so indisposeth us to the duties of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> callings. Christ upon the Crosse was grieved to the utmost, yet it did not take away his care for his mother; so the <hi>good theefe</hi> in the middest of his pangs laboured to gaine his fellow, and <note place="margin">Luk. 23. 42</note> to save his owne soule, and to glorifie Christ. If this be so in griefe of body
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:23925:63"/>
which taketh away the free use of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and exercise of grace more then any other griefe, then much more in griefe from more remote causes, for in extremity of body the sicknesse may be such, as all that wee can performe to God is a quiet submission, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to bee carried unto Christ by the prayers of others; we should so minde our griefe as not to forget Gods mercy, or our owne duty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when wee forget the <note place="margin">2</note> grounds of comfort, &amp; suffer our minde to runne onely upon the present grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, it is a sinne to dwell on sinne and turmoile our thoughts about it, when we are called to thankfulnesse. A Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian in good discretion forbids a dish at sometimes to prevent the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some disease, which another time hee gives way unto. So wee may and ought to abstaine from too much feeding our thoughts upon our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in case of discouragement, which at other times is very necessary. It should be our wisedome in such cases to change the object, and labour to take
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:23925:64"/>
off our minds, and give them to that which calls more for them; Griefe oft presseth unseasonably upon us, when there is cause of joy, and when we are called to joy; as <hi>Ioab</hi> justly found fault with <hi>David</hi> for grieving too much, when GOD had given him the victory, and rid him and the State of a traiterous sonne. GOD hath made some dayes for joy, and joy is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per worke of those dayes. <hi>This is the</hi>

Joy is the constant temper which the soule should bee in, <hi>Rejoyce evermore,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Thes. 5. 16.</note> (saith the Apostle.) If a sinke bee stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, we stir it not more, but goe into a sweeter roome.

Thirdly, Griefe is too much, when it inclines the soule to any inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <note place="margin">3.</note> courses: (for if it bee not lookt to it is an ill counsellor) when either it hurts the health of our bodies, or drawes the soule (for to ease it selfe) to some unlawfull liberty. When grief keeps such a noise in the soule, that it will not heare what the messengers of God, or the still voice of the Spirit saith, as in combustions, loud cries are scarce heard: so in such cases the soule will neither heare it selfe, nor others. The fruit of this overmuch trouble of spirit, is increase of trouble.</p>

The way to still the soule, as it is under our corrupt selfe, is not to parlee with it, and divide government for peace sake, as if wee should gratifie the flesh in something, to redeeme li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the spirit in other things; for we shall finde the flesh will be too en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croching.

not with subtilty and discourse, so much, as with peremptory violence si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence it and vexe it: An enemy that parlees will yeeld at length. Grace is nothing else but that blessed power, whereby as spirituall, wee gaine upon our selves as carnall. Holy <hi>love</hi> is that which wee gaine of selfe-love; and so <hi>joy,</hi> and <hi>delight, &amp;c.</hi> Grace labours to winne ground of the old man, untill at length it be all in all; Indeed wee are never our selves perfectly, till we have wholly put off our selves. Nothing should bee at a greater distance to us then our selves. This is the reason why carnall men that have nothing above themselves but their <hi>corrupt selfe,</hi> sinke in great troubles, having nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to uphold them, whereas a good man is wiser then <hi>himselfe,</hi> holier then himselfe, stronger then himselfe, there is something in him more then a man. There be evills that the spirit of man alone out of the goodnesse of nature cannot beare, but the spirit of man as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted with an higher spirit, will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and carry him through. It is a good
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:23925:72"/>
trial of a mans condition to know what he esteemes to be <hi>himselfe.</hi> A godly man counts the inner man, the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied part, to be himselfe, whereby hee stands in relation to Christ and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life. Another man esteemes his contentment in the world, the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his carnall desires, the respect hee findes from men by reason of his parts, or something without him, that he is master of, this he counts <hi>himselfe,</hi> and by this hee values himselfe, and to this he makes his best thoughts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devours serviceable; And of crosses in these things he is most sensible, and so sensible, that he thinks himself undone if hee seeth not a present issue out of them.</p>
               <p>That which most troubles a good man in all troubles, is <hi>himselfe,</hi> so farre as he is unsubdued; he is more disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>himselfe,</hi> than with all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles out of <hi>himselfe;</hi> when hee hath gotten the better once of <hi>himselfe,</hi> whatsoever falls from without, is light; where the spirit is enlarged, it cares not much for outward bondage; where
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:23925:72"/>
the spirit is lightsome, it cares not much for outward darkenesse; where the spirit is setled, it cares not much for outward changes; where the spirit is one with it selfe, it can beare out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward breaches; where the spirit is sound, it can beare outward sicknesse. Nothing can bee very ill with us, when all is well within. This is the comfort of a holy man, that though hee bee troubled with himselfe, yet by reason of the spirit in him which is his <hi>better selfe,</hi> hee workes out by degrees, what ever is contrary. As Spring-water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cleere of it selfe, workes it selfe cleane, though it be troubled by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing cast in; as the Sea will endure no poysonfull thing, but casts it upon the shore. But a carnall man is like a Spring corrupted, that cannot worke it selfe cleare, because it is wholly tainted; his eye and light is darknesse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wonder if hee seeth nothing. Sinne lieth upon his understanding, and hinders the knowledge of it selfe; it lies close upon the will, and hinders the striving against it selfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:23925:73"/>
True <hi>selfe</hi> that is worth the owning, is when a man is taken into a higher condition and made one with Christ, and esteemes neither of himselfe nor others, as happy for any thing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the flesh. 1. Hee is under the law and government of the Spirit, and so farre as he is himselfe, works accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that principle: 2. He labours more and more to be transformed into the likenesse of Christ, in whom hee esteemeth that hee hath his best being. 3. He esteemes of all things that befall him, to bee good or ill, as they further or hinder his best condition. If all bee well for that, hee counts himselfe well, whatsoever else befals him.</p>
               <p>Another man when hee doth any thing that is good, acts not his owne part; but a godly man when hee doth good, is in his proper element; what another man doth for by ends and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that <hi>hee</hi> doth from a new nature; which if there were no Law to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, yet would moove him to that which is pleasing to Christ. If hee bee drawen aside by passion or temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:23925:73"/>
                  <hi>that</hi> hee judgeth not to bee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but taketh a holy revenge on himselfe for it, as being redeemed and taken out from himselfe; hee thinkes himselfe no <hi>debtor,</hi> nor to owe any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to his corrupt selfe. That which he plots and projects and works for is, that Christ may rule every where, and especially in himselfe, for he is not his owne but Christs, and therefore desires to bee more and more emptied of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that Christ might bee <hi>all in all</hi> in him.</p>
               <p>Thus we see, what great use there is of dealing with our selves, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter composing and setling of our souls. Which though it bee a course without glory and ostentation in the world, as causing a man to retire inwardly into his owne breast, having no other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse but God and himselfe; and though it bee likewise irksome to the flesh, as calling the soule home to it selfe, being desirous naturally to wander abroad, and be a stranger at home: Yet it is a course both good in it selfe, and makes the soule good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:23925:74"/>

By this the <hi>tree</hi> is made good, and the <hi>fruit</hi> cannot but be answerable; by this the soule it selfe is set in tune, whence there is a pleasant harmony in our whole conversation. Without this, wee may doe that which is outwardly good to others, but wee can never bee good our selves.

of what is done at home in our owne hearts? that we should live knowne to others, and yet die unknowne to our selves? that we should be able to give account of any thing better then of our selves to our selves?

               <p>And therefore let us sift our actions, and our passions, and see what is <hi>flesh</hi> in them, and what is <hi>spirit,</hi> and so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the <hi>precious</hi> from the <hi>vile.</hi> It is good likewise to consider what sinne we were guilty of before, which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved GOD to give us up to excesse in any passion, and wherein we have grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Spirit; Passion will bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>When the soule is invred to this dealing with it selfe, it will learne the skill to command, and passions will be soone commanded, as being invred to be examined and checked; As wee see doggs, and such like domesticall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that will not regard a stranger, yet will be quieted in brawles present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the voice of their <hi>Master,</hi> to which they are accustomed.

So soone as grace en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into the heart, it frameth the heart to be in some measure publique: and thinks it hath not its end, in the bare enjoying of any thing, untill it can improve what it hath for a further end. Thus to seeke our selves, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our selves, and thus to deny our selves, is truely to seeke our selves. It is no selfe-seeking, when wee care for no more then that, without which we cannot comfortably serve God.

It is further a cleare evidence of a spirit subdued, when wee will disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">7.</note> the truth of our affection towards God and his people, though with cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of others. <hi>David</hi> was content to endure the censure of neglecting the state and Majesty of a King, out of joy for setling the Arke. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> could <note place="margin">Neh. 2. 3.</note> not dissemble his griefe for the ruines of the Church, though in the Kings presence: It is a comfortable signe of the wasting of selfe-love, when wee can be at a point what becomes of our selves, so it goe well with the cause of God and the Church.</p>
               <p>Now the way to prevaile still more over our selves, (as when we are to do or suffer any thing, or withstand any person in a good cause, &amp;c.) is, not to thinke that we are to deale with men, <note place="margin">How to get the mastery of our selves.</note> yea, or with Devils so much as with our selves.

The more we see and grieve for <hi>pride,</hi> which is as immediate issue of our corrupted nature, the lesse it is, because wee <hi>see</hi> it by a contrary grace; the more <hi>sight</hi> the more hatred, the more <hi>hatred</hi> of sinne the more love of grace, and the more <hi>love</hi> the more life, which the more lively it is, the more it is sensible of the contrary: upon every discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and conflict corruption loses some ground, and grace gaines upon it.</p>

laid up safe in Christ, who (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing) passe their few dayes here in an uncomfortable, wearisome, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary <hi>sadnesse of spirit,</hi> being kept in ignorance of their happy condition by Sathans <hi>jugling</hi> and their own mistakes, and so come to heaven before they are aware.

                  <p>As the distemper of the <hi>fancie</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing <note place="margin">Laesa phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasia.</note> the act of reason, oftentimes breeds madnesse in regard of civill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation; So it breeds likewise <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi> madnesse, carrying men to those things, which if they were in their right wits they would utterly abhorre; therefore wee cannot have too much care upon what wee fixe our thoughts; And what a glorious discovery is there of the excellencies of <hi>Religion</hi> that would even ravish an <hi>Angell,</hi> which may raise up, exercise, &amp; fill our hearts?
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:23925:125"/>
We see our <hi>fancie</hi> hath so great a force in naturall conceptions, that it oft sets a <hi>marke</hi> and <hi>impression</hi> upon that which is <hi>conceived</hi> in the <hi>wombe.</hi> So likewise strong and <hi>holy</hi> conceits of things (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a divine vertue accompanying of them,) transforme the soule, and breed spirituall impressions answerable to our spirituall apprehensions. It would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent many <hi>crosses,</hi> if we would conceive of things as they are; When <hi>trouble</hi> of minde, or <hi>sicknesse</hi> of body, and <hi>death</hi> it selfe commeth, what will remaine of all that <hi>greatnesse</hi> which filled our <hi>fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> before? <hi>then</hi> we can <hi>judge</hi> soberly, and <hi>speake</hi> gravely of things. The best way of happinesse, is not to <hi>multiply</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours or riches, &amp;c. but to <hi>cure</hi> our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of things, and then we cannot be very much cast downe with any thing befalls us here.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when any thing is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to our soules, which wee see is ready to worke upon us; wee should aske of our selves, upon what ground wee entertaine such a conceit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we shall have the same judgement
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:23925:126"/>
after we have yeelded to it as now wee have? and whether wee will have the same judgement of it in <hi>sicknesse</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> and at the day of <hi>reckoning</hi> as we have for the present? That which is of it selfe evill, is <hi>alwayes</hi> so at one time as well as another; if the time will come, when wee shall thinke those things to be vaine, which <hi>now</hi> we are so eagerly set upon, as if there were some great good in them; Why should wee not thinke so of them <hi>now,</hi> when as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of our <hi>judgement</hi> may doe us good, rather then to be led on with a <hi>pleasing</hi> error untill that time, wherein the sight of our error will fill our hearts with horror and shame, without hope of ever changing our condition.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore is a speciall use of these Soliloquies, to awake the <hi>soule,</hi> and to stirre up <hi>reason</hi> cast asleepe by Sathans <hi>charmes,</hi> that so scattering the <hi>clouds</hi> through which things seeme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then they are, wee may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne and judge of things according to their true and constant nature; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of thy soule, Shall I alwayes bee

Is my judge of my minde? Will not a time come when all things shall appeare as they are? Is this according to the rule, &amp;c?</p>

then it must be drawne to a head, from a <hi>confused</hi> griefe to some more <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> sinne, that so wee may strike the right veine; but if wee finde the spirit much cast downe for particular sinnes, then comfort is presently to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; But if the griefe be not fully <note place="margin">3.</note> ripe, <hi>then,</hi> as we use to help <hi>nature</hi> in its offers to purge, <hi>by Physick,</hi> till the sick matter be carried away; so when <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> moved by the <hi>spirit,</hi> begins to ease it selfe by <hi>confession,</hi> it is good to help forward the worke of it, till wee finde the heart low enough for comfort to be laid upon.

                  <p>In case of stifnesse and standing out, it is fit the <hi>Man of God</hi> should take some <hi>authority</hi> upon him, and lay a <hi>charge</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the soules of men in the name of Christ, to give way to the truth of Christ, and to forbeare putting off that mercy which is so kindly offered, when we judge it to be their portion; which course will be succesfull in hearts <hi>awed</hi> with a reverend feare of <hi>grieving Gods spirit.</hi> Sometimes men must bee dealt roundly withall, as <hi>David</hi> here deales with his owne soule, that so whilest we aske a reason of their dejection, they may plainly see they have no reason to be so cast downe; for oftentimes <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances</hi> are irrationall, rising from <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes;</hi> and <hi>counsell,</hi> bringing into the soule a <hi>fresh light,</hi> dissolves those grosse

               </argument>
               <p>BUt to come neerer to the unfolding of this <hi>trusting</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> useth here as a remedy against all distempers. Howsoever confidence and trust bee an <hi>affection</hi> of nature, yet by the <hi>spirits</hi> sanctifying and carrying it to the <hi>right object,</hi> it becomes a <hi>grace</hi> of wonderfull use. In the things of <hi>this life</hi> usually hee that <hi>hopes most</hi> is the most unwise man; he being <hi>most decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> that hopes most, because he trusts in that which is <hi>uncertaine,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deceitfull hope is counted but the dreame of a waking man. But in <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> it is farre otherwise, here, hope is the maine supporting grace of the soule, springing from faith in the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> are often taken in the same sense, though a distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them hath somtimes its use: <hi>faith</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:23925:148"/>
lookes to the word <hi>promising,</hi> hope to the thing <hi>promised</hi> in the word, faith lookes to the <hi>authority</hi> of the <hi>promiser,</hi> hope (especially) to the <hi>goodnesse</hi> of the <hi>promise; faith</hi> looks upon things as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, <hi>hope</hi> as to come hereafter. God as the <hi>first truth</hi> is that which faith relyes on, but God as the <hi>chiefe good,</hi> is that which hope rests on, <hi>trust</hi> or <hi>confidence</hi> is nothing else, but the strength of <hi>hope;</hi> if the thing hoped for be <hi>deferred,</hi> then of necessity it ensorces <hi>waiting,</hi> and waiting is nothing else but hope and trust lengthened.</p>
               <p>Howsoever, there may be use of these and such like <hi>distinctions,</hi> yet usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they are taken promiscuously, especially in the old Testament. The nature and use of <hi>faith</hi> is set out by tearmes of <hi>staying, resting, leaning, rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our selves</hi> upon God, &amp;c. which come all to one, and therefore wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare any further curious distinction.</p>
               <p>Now seeing <hi>trusting in God,</hi> is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy <note place="margin">
                     <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Soule</hi> must be brought together by <hi>trust.</hi>
                  </note> against all distempers, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that wee should bring the <hi>object</hi> and the <hi>act</hi> (God and the Soule) toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:23925:148"/>
for effecting of which, it is good to know something concerning <hi>God,</hi> and something concerning <hi>trust.</hi> God is onely the fit <hi>object</hi> of trust, <hi>hee</hi> hath all the properties of that which should be trusted on; A man can bee in no condition wherein God is at a losse and cannot helpe him; if comforts be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>he</hi> can <hi>create</hi> comforts, not onely out of <hi>nothing,</hi> but out of discomforts; He made the <hi>Whale</hi> that swallowed up <note place="margin">Ionah 1. 17</note>

So it is in faith, if the foundation thereof be not <hi>firme,</hi> the soule cannot build it selfe <hi>strongly</hi> upon it; Faith hath a double <hi>principle</hi> to build on, either a principle of <hi>being,</hi> or a principle of <hi>knowing,</hi> the principle of <hi>being</hi> is <hi>God himselfe,</hi> the principle of <hi>knowing</hi> is <hi>Gods word,</hi> whereby God commeth forth <hi>(out of that hidden light which none can attaine unto)</hi> and discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his meaning towards us for our good.</p>
               <p>This then must 1. be supposed for a ground, <hi>that there is a God,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> God <note place="margin">1.</note>

And whilst he will not willingly doe Gods will, Gods will is done upon him against his will.</p>
               <p>The most casuall things fall under <hi>providence,</hi> yea (the most disordered thing in the world, (sinne) and (of sins the most horrible that ever the Sunne beheld) <hi>the crucifying of the Lord of life,</hi> was guided by a hand of <hi>providence</hi> to the greatest good.

               <p>For setling of our <hi>faith</hi> the more, God taketh liberty in using weake meanes to great purposes, and setteth aside more <hi>likely</hi> and <hi>able</hi> meanes, yea sometimes he altogether disableth the greatest meanes, and worketh often by no meanes at all. It is not from want of power in God, but from abundance &amp; multiplying of his goodnesse, that hee useth any means at all: there is nothing that he doth by meanes, but hee is able to doe without meanes.</p>
               <p>Nay, God often bringeth his will to passe by crossing the course and stream of meanes, to shew his own <hi>soveraignty,</hi> and to exercise our <hi>dependance;</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his very enemies, the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his owne will, and so, to bring about that which they oppose most.

God knowes how to take our enemies off, sometimes by changing, or stopping their wills, by offering considerations of some good or ill, danger or profit to them; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by taking away, and weakning all their strength, or else by opposing an equall or greater strength against it.

               <p>God is not onely the cause of things and actions, but the cause likewise of the cessation of them, why they fall not out at all. God is the cause why <note place="margin">Deus est prima causa cujuscun<expan>

from Gods withdrawing the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of his light and strength from them.

               <p>Nothing so <hi>high,</hi> that is above his providence; Nothing so <hi>low,</hi> that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it; Nothing so large, but is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by it; Nothing so confused, but God can order it; Nothing so <hi>bad,</hi> but he can draw good out of it.

               <p>It cannot but bring strong security to the soule, to know that in all variety of changes, and intercourse of good and bad events, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Our</hi> God, hath such a disposing hand.

               </p>
               <p>Gods wayes seeme oft to us full of contradictions, because his course is to bring things to passe by contrary meanes. There is a mystery not onely in Gods <hi>decree</hi> concerning mans eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal estate, but likewise in his <hi>providence,</hi> as why he should deale unequally with men, otherwise equall. His judgements are a great depth, which we cannot fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but they will swallow up our thoughts and understandings. God oft wraps himselfe in a cloude, and will not be seene till afterward. Where we cannot trace him, wee ought with S. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>admire</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> him. When we are in heaven, it will be one part of our happinesse, to see the harmony of those things, that seeme now confused unto us. All Gods dealings will appeare beautifull in their due seasons, though we for the present see not the contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity

and linking together of one thing with another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence likewise proceeds a holy resigning of our selves to God, <hi>who doth</hi>

                  <hi>all things according to the counsell of his owne will.</hi> His <hi>will</hi> is a wise will, it is <note place="margin">Voluntas Dei, necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas rei.</note> guided by <hi>counsell,</hi> a soveraigne prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling will.

               <p>Wee may desire and long after a change of our condition, when wee looke upon the <hi>greevance</hi> it selfe, but
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:23925:157"/>
yet rembember still that it be with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, when wee looke upon the <hi>will of God,</hi> as <hi>How long Lord, holy and</hi>

               <p n="3">3. The way patiently to <hi>suffer</hi> Gods will, is to inure our selves first to <hi>doe</hi> it. <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                  <hi>Passive</hi> obedience springs from <hi>active.</hi> He that endures any thing, will endure it quietly, when hee knowes it is the will of God, and considers that what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver befalls him, comes from his good pleasure.

parts under the same crosse, how qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly and calmely the one that establish eth his soule on Christ, will beare his afflictions, wheréas the other rageth as a <hi>foole,</hi> and is more beaten.</p>
               <p>Nothing should displease us, that pleaseth God; neither should any thing be pleasing to us, that displeaseth him. This conformity is the ground of com fort. Our owne will takes away God, <note place="margin">Propria vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas Deu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quantum in ipsa eximit.</note> as much as in it lyes. <hi>If we acknowledge God in all our wayes, he will direct our pathes, and leade us the way that we should</hi>

a <hi>providence,</hi> but first consider what is <hi>our</hi> part, and so farre as God prevents us with light, and affords us helpes and meanes, we must not be failing in our duty. Wee should neither out-runne, nor bee wanting to <hi>providence.</hi> But in perplexed cases, where the reasons on both sides seeme to bee equally ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, see whether part makes more for the maine end the <hi>glory of God,</hi> the <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi>

               <p n="3">3. When things are cleare, and God <note place="margin">3.</note> will is manifest, further <hi>deliberation</hi> is
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:23925:159"/>
dangerous, and for the most part ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a false heart, as we see in <hi>Balaam,</hi> who though he knew Gods minde, yet would bee still consulting, till God in judgement gave him up to what his <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous</hi> heart led him unto. A man is not fit to deliberate, till his heart be purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of false aymes, for else God will give him up to the darknesse of his owne spirit, and he will bee alwayes warping unfit for any byas. Where the aymes are good, there God delighteth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale his good pleasure. Such a soule is levell and suitable to any good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, that shall bee given; and prepared to entertaine it. In what measure any last is favoured, in that measure the soule is darkned. Even <hi>wise Solomon,</hi> whilest he gave way to his <hi>lust,</hi> had like to have lost his wisdome.</p>
               <p>We must looke to our place wherein God hath set us; if we be in subjection to others, <hi>their</hi> authority ought to sway with us. Neither is it the calling of those that are subjects, to enquire o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-curiously into the mysteries of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for <hi>that,</hi> both in peace and

war breeds much disturbance, and would trouble all designes.</p>
               <p>The lawes under which we live, are particular determinations of the law of God in some duties of the <hi>second table.</hi> For example; The Law of God sayes, <hi>Exact no more then what is thy due.</hi> But what in particular is thy due, and what <hi>another</hi> mans, the lawes of men deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and therefore ought to be a rule unto us so farre as they reach; though it be too narrow a rule to be good <hi>only</hi>

Where it dashes not against Gods law, what is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>law,</hi> is agreeable to <hi>conscience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The law of God in the due enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, to the least beginning and occasions is exceeding broad, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes of whatsoever stands with the light of reason, or the bonds of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, civility, &amp;c. and whatsoever is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these, is <hi>so farre</hi> against Gods law. So that higher rules be looked to
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:23925:160"/>
in the first place, there is nothing love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or praise-worthy among men, but ought to be seriously thought on.</p>
               <p>Nature of it selfe is wilde and unta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and impatient of the yoke; but as beasts that cannot endure the yoke at first, after they are enured a while unto it, beare it willingly, &amp; cary their work more easily by it: So the yoke of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, makes the life regular and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et.

               <p>

               <p>Though blindfold obedience, such as our <hi>Adversaries</hi> would have, be such <note place="margin">5.</note> as will never stand with sound peace of conscience, which alwayes lookes to have light to direct it; (for else a blinde conscience would breed blinde feares) yet in such doubtfull cases wherein we cannot winde out our selves, we ought to light our candles at others, whom we have cause to thinke by their <hi>place</hi> and <hi>parts</hi> should see further then wee. In matters of outward estate, wee will have men skilfull, of our counsell; and
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:23925:161"/>
Christians would finde more sound peace, if they would advise with their godly and learned Pastors and friends. Where there is not a direct word, there is place for the counsell of a prudent man. And it is a happinesse for them <note place="margin">Sententia boni viri.</note> whose <hi>businesse</hi> is much, and <hi>parts</hi> not large, to have the benefit of those that can give ayme, and see further then themselves. The meanest Christian understands his owne way, and knowes how to doe things with better advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to his soule, then a gracelesse though learned man; yet is still glad of further discovery. <hi>In counsell</hi> there is peace, <hi>the thoughts</hi> being thus <hi>establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When wee have advised and served Gods <hi>providence</hi> in the use of meanes, then if it fall out otherwise then wee looke for, wee may confidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that God would not have it so, otherwise to our griefe we may say, it was the fruit of our owne rashnesse.</p>
               <p>Where we have cause to thinke that wee have used better meanes in the search of grounds, and are more free
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:23925:161"/>
from partiall affections then others, there we may use our owne advise more safely. Otherwise what wee doe by consent from others, is more secure and lesse offensive, as being more coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced.</p>
               <p>In advice with others, it is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to be generally wise, but experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced and knowing in that wee aske, which is an honour to Gods gifts where we finde them in any kinde. When we set about things in <hi>passion,</hi> we work not as men or Christians, but in a bestiall manner. The more passion, the lesse discretion; because passion hinders the sight of what is to be done. It clouds the soule, and puts it on to action with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out advisement. Where passions are subdued, and the soule purged and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there is nothing to hinder the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of Gods spirit; the soule is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a cleane glasse to receive light from above. And that is the reason why <hi>mortified men</hi> are <hi>fittest</hi> to advise with in the particular cases incident to a Christian life.</p>
               <p>After all advise, extract what is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, <note place="margin">6.</note>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:23925:162"/>
and what our spirits do most bend unto: For in things that concerne our selves, God affords a light to discerne out of what is spoken, what best suteth us. And every man is to follow most what his owne <hi>conscience,</hi> (after infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) dictates unto him; because conscience is Gods deputy in us, and under God most to bee regarded, and whosoever sinnes against <hi>it,</hi> in his own construction sinnes against God. God vouchsafeth every Christian in some degree, the grace of <hi>spirituall prudence,</hi> whereby they are enabled to discerne what is fittest to be done in things that fall within their compasse.</p>
               <p>It is good to observe the particular becks of providence, how things joyne <note place="margin">7.</note> and meete together: fit occasions and suting of things are intimations of Gods will. <hi>Providence</hi> hath a language, which is well understood by <hi>those</hi> that have a familiar acquaintance with Gods dealing; they see a traine of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, leading one way more then to another.</p>
               <p>Take especiall heed of not grieving <note place="margin">8.</note>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:23925:162"/>
the Spirit, when he offers to bee our guide, by studying evasions, and wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the case were otherwise. This is to be Law-givers to our selves, thinking that we are wiser than God. The use of discretion is not to direct us about the end, whether wee should doe well or ill, (for a single heart alwayes aymes at good:) but when we resolve upon do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, and yet doubt of the manner how to performe it: discretion lookes not so much to what is lawfull, (for that is taken for granted,) but what is most expedient. A discreet man lookes not to what is <hi>best,</hi> so much as what is <hi>fittest,</hi> in such and such respects, by ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumstances, which if they sort not, doe vary the nature of the thing it selfe.</p>
               <p>And because it is not in <hi>man</hi> to know his owne wayes, we should looke up unto <hi>Christ,</hi> the great <hi>Councellour</hi> of his <hi>Church,</hi> to vouchsafe the spirit of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell and direction to us: that may <hi>make our way plaine before us,</hi> by suggesting unto us, <hi>this is the way, walke in it.</hi> Wee owe God this respect, to depend upon
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:23925:163"/>
him for direction in <hi>the particular</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of our lives, in regard that hee is our <hi>Soveraigne,</hi> and his will is the <hi>rule,</hi> and we are to be accountable to him, as our <hi>Iudge.</hi> It is God onely that can see through businesses, and all helps and lets that stand about,</p>
               <p>After we have rolled our selves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, wee should immediately take that course he enclines our hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, without further distracting feare. Otherwise it is a signe wee <hi>commit not our way unto him,</hi> when we do not quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>trust him,</hi> but remain stil as thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as if wee did not trust him. After <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>trust</hi> followes <hi>the peace of God,</hi> and a heart void of further dividing <hi>care.</hi> Wee should therefore presently question our hearts, for questioning his <hi>care,</hi> and not regard what <hi>feare</hi> will be ready to suggest, for that is apt to raise conclusions against our selves, out of selfe-conceited grounds, whereby wee usurpe upon GOD, and wrong our selves.</p>
               <p>It was a good resolution of the <hi>three young men</hi> in <hi>Daniel, We are not carefull</hi>

men would have beene in darknesse about their finall condition, and the way to please God and to pacifie and purge their consciences, had not the word of God set downe the <hi>spring</hi> and <hi>cause</hi> of all evill, together with the cure of it, and directed us how to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and to raise our selves above all the evill which wee meet withall betwixt us and happines, and to make us every way <hi>wise to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Hence it is that the <hi>Psalmist</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres the manifestation of God by his <hi>

                  <p>And thus wee returne to God by <hi>cleaving</hi> to him, from whom we fell by <hi>distrust,</hi> living under a <hi>new covenant</hi>

                  <p>The way then whereby <hi>faith</hi> quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the soule, is, by raising it <hi>above</hi> all discontentments and stormes here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and pitching it upon God, thereby uniting it to him, whence it drawes <hi>vertue</hi> to oppose and bring under what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever troubles its peace.

               <p>Of all men <hi>Solomon</hi> was the fittest to judge of this, because 1. hee had a large heart able to comprehend the variety of things, and 2.

               <p>It is a matter both to be wondred at and pittyed, that the soule having God in Christ set before it, alluring it unto him, that hee might raise it, inlarge it, and fill it, and so make it above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, should yet debase &amp; make it selfe narrower and weaker by lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to things meaner then it selfe.</p>
               <p>The Kingdome, Soveraignty, and large command of <hi>Man,</hi> continueth while he rests upon God, in whom hee raignes (in some sort) over all things under him; but so soone as he removes from God to any thing else, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes weake and narrow and slavish presently; for,</p>
               <p>The soule is as that which it relyes upon; if on <hi>vanity</hi> it selfe becomes vain; for that which contents the soule must

               <p>But see the <hi>insufficiency</hi> of all other things (out of God) to support the soul, in their severall degrees. <hi>First,</hi> All <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> things can make a man no happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <note place="margin">1.</note> then outward things can doe, they cannot reach beyond their proper spheare: but our <hi>greatest</hi> grievances are <hi>spirituall.</hi> And as for inward things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">2.</note>

               <p>And for any workes that proceed from grace, by <hi>trusting</hi> thereunto they <note place="margin">3.</note> prove like the <hi>reede</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which not only deceives us, but hurts us with the splinters: Good workes are <hi>good,</hi> but confidence in them is hurtfull; and there is more of our <hi>owne</hi> in them (for the most part) to humble us, then of Gods spirit to embolden us so farre as to trust in them. Alas they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from us, but weaknesse and defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore <hi>since the fall,</hi> GOD would have the object of our <hi>trust</hi> to be <hi>(out</hi> of our selves) <hi>in him;</hi> and to that purpose he useth all meanes to take us out of <hi>our selves,</hi> and from the <hi>creature,</hi> that <hi>he</hi> only might be <hi>our trust.</hi>

things that are spoken of <hi>trust</hi> are onely made good by God in Christ, who (as trusted) doth all for us.</p>
               <p>God hath prescribed <hi>trust,</hi> as the way to carry our soules to <hi>himselfe,</hi> in whom we should only rely, and not in our imperfect <hi>trust</hi> which hath its eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing; Neither will <hi>trust</hi> in God himselfe for the <hi>present</hi> suffice us for <hi>future</hi> strength and grace, as if <hi>tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting</hi> in God <hi>to day,</hi> would suffice to strengthen us for <hi>tomorrow;</hi> but wee must <hi>renew</hi> our trust for <hi>fresh</hi> supply, upon every fresh <hi>occasion.</hi> So that wee see God <hi>alone</hi> must be the <hi>object</hi> of our <hi>trust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is still left in mans nature a desire of <hi>pleasure profit,</hi> and of what ever the <hi>creature</hi> presents as <hi>good,</hi> but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of gracious good is altogether lost, the soule being wholy infected with a contrary taste.

                  <hi>promises</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> for the leading of a Christian life, for true faith desires <hi>hea ling</hi> mercy, as well as <hi>pardoning</hi> mercy, and then <hi>to Heaven</hi> and all things that may bring us thither.</p>
               <p>By all this wee see that it is not so easie a matter as the world takes it, to bring <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>soule</hi> together by <hi>trusting</hi> on him; It must be effected by the <hi>mighty power</hi> of God, <hi>raising up</hi> the <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 20.</note> soule to himselfe, to lay hold upon the glorious power, goodnesse, and other <hi>excellencies</hi> that are in <hi>him;</hi> God is not onely the <hi>object,</hi> but the working <hi>cause</hi> of our <hi>trust;</hi> for such is our pronenesse to live by <hi>sense,</hi> and naturall <hi>reason,</hi> and such is the strangenesse and height of <hi>divine</hi> things, such our inclination to a <hi>selfe sufficiency</hi> and contentment in the <hi>creature,</hi> and so hard a matter is it to take off the soule from <hi>false</hi> bottomes, by reason of our <hi>unacquaintance</hi> with God and his wayes; besides such guilt still remaines upon our soules for our rebellion and unkindnesse towards God: that it makes us afraid to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine serious thoughts of him; and so
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:23925:182"/>
great is the distance betwixt his <hi>infinite</hi> Majesty, (before whom the very <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> doe cover their faces) and <hi>us,</hi> by reason of the <hi>unspiritualnesse</hi> of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being opposite to his most <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> purity, that we cannot be brought to any <hi>familiarity</hi> with the Lord (so as to come into his holy presence with <hi>confidence</hi> to rely upon <hi>him,</hi> or any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to have communion with him,) till our hearts be sanctified and lifted up by <hi>divine vigour</hi> infused into them.</p>
               <p>Though there be some <hi>inclination</hi> by reason of the remainder of the image of God in us, to an outward <hi>morall</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the <hi>Law,</hi> yet alas, we have not onely <hi>no seeds</hi> of <hi>Evangelicall</hi> truths and of faith to beleeve them, but an utter <hi>contrariety</hi> in our <hi>natures</hi> (as corrupted) either to this, or any other good. When our conscience is once awaked; we me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate nothing but <hi>feares</hi> and <hi>terrors,</hi> and dare not so much as think of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry God, but rather how wee may es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape and fly from him. Therefore toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a deepe consideration of the grounds wee have of <hi>trusting</hi> God, it is
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:23925:182"/>
necessary wee should thinke of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition of our hearts unto it, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when there is greatest neede thereof, that so our hearts may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to put up that petition of the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> to God; <hi>Lord increase our faith, Lord helpe us against our unbeleeving hearts, &amp;c.</hi> By <hi>prayer</hi> and holy thoughts stirred up in the use of the meanes, we shall feele divine strength infused and conveyed into our soules to <hi>trust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The more care we ought to have to maintaine our trust in God, because (besides the hardnesse of it) it is a radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and fundamentall grace; it is as it were the <hi>mother root</hi> and great <hi>veyne</hi> whence the exercise of all graces have their beginning and strength. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of a plant though it <hi>appeares</hi> first <note place="margin">Defects in <hi>life</hi> rise fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> defects in <hi>trust.</hi>
                  </note> from the withering of the twigs and branches, yet it arises chiefly from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in the roote; So the decay of grace may appeare to the view first in our <hi>company, carryage,</hi> and <hi>speeches,</hi> &amp;c. but the primitive and originall ground of the same, is weaknesse of <hi>faith</hi> in the heart; therefore it should be our wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:23925:183"/>
(especially) to looke to the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>roote;</hi> we must 1. looke that our <hi>principles</hi> and <hi>foundation</hi> be good, and 2. build strongly upon them, and 3. <hi>repaire</hi> our building every day as conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall breaches shall be made upon us; either by <hi>corruptions</hi> and <hi>temptations</hi> from <hi>within</hi> or <hi>without;</hi> And wee shall finde that the maine breaches of our lives arise either fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>false</hi> principles, or doubts, or <hi>mindlesnesse</hi> of those that are <hi>true;</hi> All sin is a turning of the soul from God to some other seeming good, but this proceeds from a former turning of the soule from God by distrust. As faith is the first returne of the soule to God, so the first degree of departing from God is by <hi>infidelity,</hi> and from thence comes a departure by <hi>other sins,</hi> by which (as sinne is of a winding na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) our unbeliefe more increaseth, and so the rent and breach betwixt our <hi>soules</hi> and <hi>God</hi> is made greater still (which is that Sathan would have) till at length by departing further and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from him, wee come to have that peremptory sentence of <hi>everlasting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture</hi>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:23925:183"/>
pronounced against us; so that our departure from God <hi>now</hi> is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to separation <hi>for ever</hi> from him. Therefore it is Sathans maine care to come betweene <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Soule,</hi> that so unloosing us from God, wee might more easily be drawne to <hi>other things;</hi> and if he drawes us to other things, it <note place="margin">Sathans study is to unloose our hearts fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God.</note> is but onely to unloose our hearts from God the more; for hee well knowes whilest our soules cleave close to God, there is no prevailing against us by any created policy or power.</p>
               <p>It was the cursed policy of <hi>Balaam</hi> to advise <hi>Balak</hi> to <hi>draw</hi> the people from <hi>God</hi> (by <hi>fornication)</hi> that so GOD might be drawne from <hi>them:</hi> the sinne of their base <hi>affections</hi> crept into the very spirits of their <hi>minde,</hi> and drew them from God to Idolatry: Bodily <hi>adultery</hi> makes way for <hi>spirituall;</hi> An unbeleeving heart is an ill heart, and a treacherous heart, because it makes us to <hi>depart from God,</hi> the <hi>living</hi> God, &amp;c. <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 12.</note> Therefore wee should especially take heed of it as wee love our lives, yea our best life which ariseth from the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:23925:184"/>
union of our soules with God.</p>
               <p>None so opposed as a <hi>Christian,</hi> and in a Christian nothing so opposed as his <hi>faith,</hi> because it opposeth whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver opposes God, both <hi>within</hi> and <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> us: it captivates and brings under whatsoever rises up against GOD in the heart, and sets it selfe against whatsoever makes head against the soule.</p>
               <p>And because mistake is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and wee are prone to conceive that to <hi>trust in God</hi> is an easie matter, therefore it is needfull that we should have a right conceit of this <hi>trust</hi> what it is, and how it may be discerned, lest we trust to an untrusty <hi>trust,</hi> and to an unsteady stay.</p>
               <p>We may by what hath been said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note place="margin">What trust in God is.</note> partly discerne the <hi>nature</hi> of it, to be nothing else<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but an exercise of faith, whereby looking to God in Christ through the <hi>promises,</hi> wee take off our soules from all other supports, and lay them upon God for deliverance and upholding in all <hi>ill, present</hi> or <hi>future,</hi> felt or feared, and the obtaining of all
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:23925:184"/>
                  <hi>good,</hi> which GOD sees expedient for us.</p>
               <p>Now that we may discerne the <hi>truth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The tryall of <hi>trust.</hi>
                  </note> of our <hi>trust in God</hi> the better, wee must know that true trust, is <hi>willing</hi> to be <note place="margin">1. It <hi>can</hi> and is <hi>willing</hi> to endure tryall.</note> 
                  <hi>tryed</hi> and searched, and can say to God as <hi>David, Now Lord what wait I for, my hope is in thee;</hi> and as it is willing to come to tryall, so it is able to endure tryall, <note place="margin">Psal. 39. 7.</note> and to hold out in opposition, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in <hi>David;</hi> If faith hath a <hi>promise,</hi> it will rely and rest upon it, say flesh and bloud what it can to the contrary; true faith is as large as the <hi>promise,</hi> and will take Gods part against whatsoever opposes it.</p>
               <p>And as faith singles not out one part <note place="margin">2. It looks to all the promises.</note> of divine truth to beleeve and rejects another, so it relyes upon God for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good thing <hi>one</hi> as well as <hi>another;</hi> the ground whereof is this, The same love of God that intends us heaven, intends us a supply of all necessaries that may bring us thither.</p>
               <p>A child that beleeves his father will <note place="margin">Fides non eligit ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectum.</note> make him <hi>Heire,</hi> doubts not but he will provide him food and nourishment,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:23925:185"/>
and give him breeding sutable to his future condition; It is a vaine pretence to beleeve that God will give us hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and yet leave us to shift for our selves in the way.</p>
               <p>Where <hi>trust</hi> is rightly planted, it gives <hi>boldnesse</hi> to the soule in going to <note place="margin">3. It makes the soule bold,</note> God, for it is grounded upon the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Gods love first to us, and seeth a warrant from him for whatsoever it <note place="margin">1.</note> trusts him for; though the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves be never so great, yet they are no greater then God is willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow; againe, <hi>trust</hi> is bold because it is grounded upon the worthinesse of a <hi>Mediator</hi> who hath made way to Gods favour for us, and appeares now in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to maintain it towards us.</p>
               <p>Yet this boldnesse is with <hi>humility,</hi> which carryes the soule out of it selfe; <note place="margin">4. yet hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble.</note> and that <hi>boldnesse</hi> which the soule by trust hath with God, is from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; it hath nothing to alleadge from it selfe but its owne emptinesse and Gods fulnesse, its owne sinfulnesse and Gods mercy, its owne humble obedience, and Gods command; hence it is that the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:23925:185"/>
true beleevers heart is not lifted up, nor swells with <hi>selfe confidence;</hi> as trust comes <hi>in</hi> that goes <hi>out;</hi> trust is never planted and growes but in an humble and low soule; trust is a holy <hi>motion</hi> of the soule to God, and motion arises from want; those (and those only) seek out abroad that want succour at home; <note place="margin">Motus ex indigentia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Plants</hi> move not from place to place because they finde nourishment where they stand; but <hi>living</hi> creatures seeke abroad for their food, and for that end have a power of mooving from place to place; and this is the reason why <hi>trust</hi> is expressed by <hi>going</hi> to God.</p>
               <p>Hereupon <hi>trust</hi> is a <hi>dependant</hi> grace answerable to our dependant conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <note place="margin">5. Trust is dependant</note> it lookes upon all things it hath or desires to have, as comming from God and his free grace and power; it desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not onely <hi>wisdome,</hi> but to be wise in <hi>his</hi> wisdome, to see in <hi>his</hi> light, to be <hi>strong</hi> in <hi>his</hi> strength, the thing it selfe contents not this grace of <hi>trust,</hi> but Gods blessing and love in the thing, it cares not for any thing further then it can have it with Gods favour and good liking.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:23925:186"/>
Hence it is that <hi>trust</hi> is an obsequions and an observing grace, stirring up the <note place="margin">6. and obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quions.</note> soule to a desire of pleasing God in all things, and to a feare of displeasing him; Hee that pretends to trust the Lord in a course of offending, may trust to this that God will meet him in another way then he lookes for: Hee that is a tenant at <hi>curtesie</hi> will not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Lord; hence it is that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle inforceth that exhortation to <hi>work out our salvation with feare and trembling,</hi>

               <p>A Ship that lyes at Anchor may bee something tossed, but yet it stil remains so fastned, that it cannot bee caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by winde or weather; the soule af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it hath cast anchor upon God, may (as we see here in <hi>David)</hi> be disquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a while, but this unsetling tends to a deeper setling; the more we <hi>beleeve,</hi> the more we are <hi>established;</hi> faith is an esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing grace, <hi>by faith we stand,</hi> and stand <hi>fast,</hi> and are able to withstand whatsoever opposeth us.

stand against God, upon whose truth and power <hi>faith</hi> relyes? The devill feares not us, but <hi>him</hi> whom we flie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to for succour; It is the ground wee stand on secures us, not our selves.</p>
               <p>As it is our happinesse, so it must be our endeavour to bring the soule close to God, that nothing get between, for then the soule hath no sure footing. When we step from God, Sathan steps in by some temptation or other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently. It requires a great deale of <hi>self deniall</hi> to bring a soule either swelling with <hi>carnall confidence,</hi> or sinking by fear and <hi>distrust,</hi> to lye levell upon God, and cleave fast to him; Square will lie fast upon Square; but our hearts are so full of unevennesse, that God hath much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do to square our hearts fit for him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the soule hath no rest without this.</p>

have nothing in view, then indeed should God bee <hi>God</hi> unto us. In times of distresse, when hee shewes himselfe in the wayes of his mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then we should especially mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his name, which will move him to discover his excellencies the more, the more wee take notice of them.

               <p>TO begin with troubles of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which indeed are the spirit of troubles, as disabling that which should uphold a man in all his troubles. A spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit set in tune, and assisted by a higher spirit, will stand out against ordinary assaults, but when God, (the God of the spirits of all flesh) shall seeme contrary to our spirits, whence then shall wee finde reliefe?</p>
               <p>Here all is spirituall, God a <hi>spirit,</hi> the soule a <hi>spirit,</hi> the terrours <hi>spirituall,</hi> the devill who joynes with these a <hi>spirit;</hi> yea, that which the soule feares for the time to come, is <hi>spirituall,</hi> and not only spirituall, but <hi>eternall,</hi> unlesse it pleaseth God at length to break out of the thick cloud, wherewith hee covers himselfe, and shine upon the soule, as in his own time he will.</p>
               <p>In this estate, comforts themselves are uncomfortable to the soule; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

quarrels with every thing, the better things it heares of, the more it is vexed. Oh what is this to mee, what have I to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>In this condition God doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in his owne shape to the soul, but in the shape of an enemy; and when God seemes against us, who shall stand for us? Our blessed Saviour in his ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had the <hi>Angels</hi> to comfort him; but had he beene a meere man, and not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by the Godhead, it was not the comfort (no not) of Angels that could have upheld him, in the sense of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">Nihil est tentatio vel universi mundi &amp; totius infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni in unum conflata, ad eam qua Deus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarius ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini poni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. <hi>Luther</hi>
                  </note> withdrawing his countenance from him. Alas then what will become of us in such a case if we be not support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>a spirit of power,</hi> and the power of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>n almighty spirit?</p>
               <p>If all the temptations of the whole world, and hell it selfe were mustered
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:23925:191"/>
together, they were nothing to this, whereby the great God sets himselfe contrary to his poore creature. None can conceive so, but those that have felt it. If the hiding of his face will so trouble the soule, what will his frowne and angry look doe? Needs must the soule bee in a wofull plight, when as God seemes not onely to bee absent from it, but an enemy to it. When a man sees no comfort from above, and lookes inward and sees lesse, when hee lookes about him, and sees nothing but evidences of Gods displeasure; beneath him, and sees nothing but desperation, clouds without, and clouds within, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but clouds in his condition here, he had need of faith to breake through all, and see Sunne through the thickest cloud.</p>
               <p>Upon this, the distressed soule is in danger to be set upon by a <hi>temptation,</hi> called the temptation of <hi>blasphemy,</hi> that <note place="margin">Tentatio blasphemia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> is, to entertain bitter thoughts against God, and especially against the grace and goodnesse of God, wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to make himselfe most knowne
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:23925:191"/>
to his creature. In those that have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully resisted divine truths made knowne unto them, and after taste, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised them, a perswasion that God hath for saken them, set on strongly by Sathan, hath a worse effect, it stirs up a hellish hatred against God, carying them to a revengefull desire of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing whatsoever is Gods, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes openly (for then they should lose the advantage of doing hurt,) yet secretly and subtilly, and under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the contrary. To this degree of <hi>blasphemie</hi> Gods children never fall, yet they may feele the venome of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption stirring in their hearts, against God and his wayes which he takes with them; and this addes greatly to the depth of their affliction, when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they think with themselves what hellish stuffe they cary in their soules. This is not so much discerned in the temptation, but after the fit is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what remitted.</p>
               <p>In this kinde of desertion, seconded with this kinde of temptation, the way is to call home the soule, and to check
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:23925:192"/>
it, and charge it to trust in God, even though he shewes himselfe an enemy, for it is but a <hi>shewe,</hi> he doth but put on a maske with a purpose to reveale him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the more graciously afterward; his maner is to worke by contraries. In this condition God lets-in some few beames of light, whereby the soul casts a longing looke upon God, even when he seemes to forsake it; it will with <hi>Ionas</hi> in the belly of hell, looke back to <note place="margin">Ion. 2. 4.</note> the holy Temple of God, it will steale a looke unto Christ. Nothing more comfortable in this condition, then to flye to him, that by experience knew what this kinde of forsaking meant, for this very end that he might bee the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to succour us in the like distresse.</p>
               <p>Learne therefore to appeale from God to God, oppose his gracious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his sweet promises to such as <hi>are in darknesse, and see no light,</hi> inviting <note place="margin">Isay 50. 10</note> them to trust in him, though thereap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to the eye of sense and reason no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but darknesse: Here make use of that sweet Relation of God in Christ, becomming a Father to us: <hi>Doubtlesse</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But these holy persons were not troubled</hi>

               </p>
               <p>True it is, that sinne is not so sweet <note place="margin">Answ.</note> in the committing, as it is heavy and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>itter in the reckoning. When <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:23925:193"/>
had once offended God, <hi>Paradise</hi> it selfe was not Paradise to him. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God which was most comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able before, was now his greatest ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, had not God out of his free infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and preventing mercy come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and hell, by the promise of the blessed seed. This seed was <hi>made sin</hi> to satisfie for sinne; sinne <hi>passive</hi> in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21</note> to satisfie for sinne <hi>active</hi> in us.</p>
               <p>When God once charges sinne upon the soule, Alas who shall take it off? When the great God shall frowne, the smiles of the creature cannot refresh us. Sinne makes us afraid of that which should be our greatest comfort; it puts a sting into every other evill; upon the seazing of any evill, either of body, soule, or condition, the guilty soule is imbittered and enraged; for from that which it feeles, it fore-speakes to it selfe worse to come. It interprets all that befalls, as the messengers of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry God, sent in displeasure to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon it. This weakneth the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, wasteth the spirits, and blasteth <note place="margin">Psal. 38.</note> the beauty even of Gods dearest ones.
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:23925:193"/>
There is not the stoutest man breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but if God sets his conscience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, it will pull him downe, and lay him flat, and fill him with such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward terrors, as he shall be more afraid of himselfe, then of all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side. This were a dolefull case, if God had not provided in Christ a remedy for this great evill of evills, and if the holy Spirit were not above the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, able as well to pacifie it by the sense of Gods love in Christ, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince it of sinne, and the just desert thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But my sinnes are not the sinnes of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                  <hi>man, my spots are not as the spots of the rest of Gods children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conceive of Gods mercy as no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <note place="margin">Answ.</note> mercy, and Christs obedience as no ordinary obedience. There is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the very greatnesse of sin, that may encourage us to goe to God, for the greater our sinnes are, the greater the glory of his powerfull mercy in pardoning, and his powerfull grace in healing will appeare. The great God delights to shew his greatnesse in the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:23925:194"/>
greatest things; Even men glory, when they are put upon that, which may set forth their worth in any kinde. God <hi>delighteth</hi> in mercy, <hi>it pleaseth him</hi> (no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">Mic. 7. 18.</note> so well) as being his chiefe <hi>Name,</hi> which then we take in <hi>vaine,</hi> when we are not moved by it to come unto him.</p>
               <p>That which Sathan would use as an argument to drive us from God, wee should use as a strong plea with him. Lord the greater my sins are, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will be the glory of thy pardoning mercy. <hi>David</hi> after his hainous sinnes, cries not for <hi>mercy,</hi> but for <hi>abundance</hi> of mercy, <hi>according to the multitude of thy mercies, doe away nine offences:</hi> his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> is not only above his <hi>own</hi> works, but above ours too. If we could sin more then he could pardon, then wee might have some reason to despaire. Despaire is a high point of <hi>Atheisme,</hi> it takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way God and Christ both at once. <hi>Iudas</hi> in betraying our Saviour, was an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his death as <hi>man,</hi> but in despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he did what lay in him to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his life as <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When therefore <hi>Conscience</hi> joyning
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:23925:194"/>
with Sathan, sets out thy sinne in its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ours, labour thou by faith to set out <hi>God</hi> in his colours, infinite in mercy and loving kindnesse. Here lies the art of a Christian; It is divine Rhetorick thus to perswade and set downe the soule.

life. The Lord thinkes himself disparaged, when wee have no higher <note place="margin">Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy not to be limited.</note> thoughts of <hi>his mercy,</hi> then of our <hi>sins,</hi> when we bring God downe to our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, when <hi>as, the heavens are not so much higher then the earth, then his thoughts of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Isay 55. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>love and goodnesse, are above the thoughts of our unworthinesse.</hi> It is a kinde of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the Almighty, to limit his boundlesse mercy in Christ, within the narrow scantling of our apprehension; yet <hi>infidelity</hi> doth this, which should stirre up in us a loathing of <hi>it</hi> above all other sinnes. But this is Sathans fetch, when once he hath brought us into sins against the <hi>Law,</hi> then to bring us into sinnes of a higher nature, and deeper danger, even against the blessed <hi>Gospell,</hi> that so there may be no remedy, but that mercy it selfe might condemne us.</p>
               <p>All the aggravations, that conscience and Sathan helping it, are able to raise sinne unto, cannot rise to that degree of infinitenesse, that Gods mercy in Christ is of. If there be a <hi>spring</hi> of sin in us, there is a spring of mercy in him, and a fountaine opened daily to wash

                  <hi>of the flesh.</hi> If it be a devill of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, yet fasting and prayer will drive him out at length.</p>
               <p>Nothing keepes the soule more downe, then sinnes of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, because corruption of nature hath gotten such strength in them, as <hi>nature</hi>

               <p>Certaine it is, the condition is most lamentable, that yeelding unto sinne brings men unto. Men are carefull to prevent dangerous sicknesses of <hi>body,</hi> and the danger of law concerning their

If they doe not perish in their sins, yet their yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will bring them into such a dolefull condition, that they would give the whole world, if they were possessours of it, to have their spirits at freedome from this bondage and feare.</p>
               <p>To such as blesse themselves in an ill way upon hope of mercy, we dare not speake a word of comfort; because God doth not, but threatens his wrath, shall burne to hell against them. Yet <note place="margin">How to deale with such, as have lived long in sinne.</note> because while life continues there may be as a <hi>space,</hi> so a <hi>place,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, these must be dealt withall in such a maner, as they may be stayed and stopped in their dangerous courses, there must be a stop before a turne.</p>
               <p>And when their consciences are throughly awaked with sense of their danger, let them seriously consider whither sin, and Sathan by sin is cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, and lay to heart the justice of God, standing before them as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell

               <p>Yet to keep them from utter sinking, let them consider withall, the unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mercy of God, as not limited to any person, or any sin, so not to any time; there is no prescription of time can binde God, his mercy hath no certaine date that will expire, so as those that fly unto it, shall have no benefit. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible mercy will never be conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">Bonitas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victi non vincitur, &amp; infinita mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serecordia non finitur. <hi>Fulgent.</hi>

               <p>What kinde of people were those that followed Christ, were they not such as had lived long in their sinfull courses? He did not onely raise them that were newly dead, but <hi>Lazarus</hi> that had lyen <hi>foure dayes in the grave.</hi> They thought Christs power in raising the dead, had reached to a short time onely, but hee would let them know, that hee could as well raise those that had been <hi>long</hi> as lately dead. If Christ be the Physitian, it is no matter of how long continuance the disease be. He is good at all kinde of diseases, and will
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:23925:197"/>
not endure the reproach of disability to cure any. Some diseases are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of other Physitians, as being above their skill to helpe, but no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit more dangerous when we are to deale with Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The blessed Martyr <hi>Bilney</hi> was much offended when he heard an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Preacher enveighing against sin, saying thus. Behold, thou hast lyen rotten in thy owne lusts, by the space of sixty yeares, even as a beast in his owne dung, and wilt thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume in one year to goe forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heaven, and that in thine olde age, as much as thou wentest back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from heaven to hell in sixty yeares? Is not this a goodly argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (saith <hi>Bilney?)</hi> Is this preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of repentance in the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus? It is as if Christ had dyed in vaine for such a man, and that hee must make satisfaction for himselfe. If I had heard (saith he) such preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of repentance in times past, I had utterly despaired of mercy:</q> We must never thinke the doore of hope to bee

As there is nothing more injurious to Christ, so nothing more foolish and groundlesse then to <hi>distrust,</hi> it being the chiefe scope of God in his word to draw our trust to him in Christ, in whom is alwayes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a breast of mercy for humbled sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to flye unto.</p>
               <p>But thus farre the consideration of our long time spent in the devils ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice should prevaile with us, as to take more shame to our selves, so to resolve more strongly for God and his wayes, and to account it more then sufficient that wee have spent already, so much precious time to so ill purposes, and the lesse time we have, to make the more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Oh how doth it grieve those that have felt the gracious power of Christ in converting their soules, that ever they should spend the stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of their parts in the worke of his and their enemie. And might they live lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, it is their full purpose for ever to
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:23925:198"/>
renounce their former wayes. There is bred in them an eternall desire of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing God, as in the wicked there is an eternall desire of offending him, which eternity of desires God lookes to in both of them, and rewards them accordingly, though hee cuts off the thred of their lives.</p>
               <p>But God in wisdome will have the conversions of such as have gone on in a course of sinning (especially after light revealed) to be rare and difficult. Birthes in those that are ancienter, are with greater danger then in the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sort.

He oft holds such upon the rack of a troubled conscience, that they and others may feare to buy the pleasure of sinne at such a rate.

Christ groaned at the raising of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> which he did not at others, because that though to an Almighty

power all things are alike easie, yet hee will shew that there be degrees of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in the things themselves, and make it appeare to us that it is so. Therefore those that have enjoyed long the sweet of sinne, may expect the bitterest sorrow and repentance for sinne.</p>
               <p>Yet never give place to thoughts of <hi>despaire,</hi> as comming from him that would overturne the end of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, which layes open the riches of Gods mercy in Christ, which riches none set out more then those that have beene <hi>the greatest of sinners,</hi> as we see in <hi>Paul.</hi> We cannot exalt God more then by taking notice, and making use of that great designe of infinite wisdome in reconciling justice and mercy toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so as <hi>now</hi> he is not only mercifull, but <hi>just in pardoning sinnes.</hi> Our Saviour <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 26.</note> as he came towards the latter age of the world, when all things seemed despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, so hee comes to some men in the latter part of their dayes.

               </p>
               <p>In this case wee must goe to God, with whom all things are possible, to put forth his Almighty power, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the pardoning, but in subduing our iniquities. He that can make a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell</hi> goe through a <hi>needles eye,</hi> can make a high conceited man lowly, a rich man humble. Therefore never question his power, much lesse his willingnesse, when he is not onely ready to receive us when we returne, but perswades and intreates us to come in unto him, yea after <hi>back-sliding</hi> and false dealing with <note place="margin">Ier. 3. 2.</note> him, wherein he allowes no mercy to be shewed by man, yet he will take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to shew mercy himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But I have often relapsed and fallen into</hi>

               <p>If Christ will have us pardon our brother seaventy seaven times, can wee <note place="margin">Answ.</note> thinke that hee will enjoyne us more, then he will be ready to doe himselfe, when in case of shewing mercy hee would have us thinke his thoughts to be farre above ours. <hi>Adam</hi> lost all by
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:23925:199"/>
once sinning, but we are under a better covenant, a covenant of mercy, and are encouraged by the Sonne to goe to the Father every day for the sinnes of that day.</p>
               <p>Where the worke of grace is begun, sin loses strength by every new fall; for hence issues deeper humility, stronger hatred, fresh indignation against our selves, more experience of the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of our hearts, renewed resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions untill sin be brought under. That should not drive us from God, which God would have us make use of, to flye the rather to him, since there is a throne of grace set up in Jesus Christ, we may boldly make use of, and let us be ashamed to sinne, and not ashamed to glorifie Gods mercy in begging par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for sin. Nothing will make us more ashamed to sin, then thoughts of so free and large mercy. It will grieve an ingenuous spirit to offend so good a God. Ah that there should be such an heart in me, as to tire the patience of God, and damme up his goodnesse, as much as in me lyes; but this is our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:23925:200"/>
that the plea of mercy from a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken spirit to a gracious Father, will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hold good. When wee are at the lowest in this world, yet there are these three grounds of comfort still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining. 1. That wee are not yet in the place of the damned, whose estate is unalterable. 2. That whilest we live, there is time and space for recovering of our selves. 3. That there is grace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, if we will not shut our hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Looke upon examples, when the Prodigall in his forlorne condition was going to his Father, his <hi>Father</hi> stayed not for him, but <hi>meetes him</hi> in the way, <note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> he did not only goe, but <hi>ranne</hi> to meet him.

                  <p>Of sorow for sin, and hatred of sinne, when right and sufficient. Helps thereto.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AH, there's my misery. If I could bee <note place="margin">Object.</note> humbled for sinne, I might hope for mercy, but I never yet knew what a broken heart meant, this soule of mine was never as yet sensible of the griefe and smart of sinne, how then can I expect any comfort?</p>
               <p>It is one of Sathans policies, to hold <note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> us in a dead and barren condition, by following us with conceits, that wee have not sorowed in proportion to our offences. True it is, we should labour that our sorow might in some measure answer to the haynousnesse of our sins: but we must know <hi>sorrow</hi> is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">Sorow not required for it selfe: as sorow.</note> for it selfe in that degree as <hi>faith is;</hi> If we could trust in God without much sorow for our sins, then it would not be required, for God delights not in our sorow as sorow, God in mercy both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it and workes it, as thereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us capable vessels of mercy, fit to acknowledge, value, and walke worthy
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:23925:201"/>
of Christ; he requres it as it is a means to imbitter sin, and the delightfull pleasures thereof unto us, and by that meanes bring us to a right judgement of our selves, and the creature, with which sinne commits spirituall adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that so we may recover our taste before lost. And then, when with the Prodigall wee returne unto our selves (having lost our selves before) we are fit to judge of the basenesse of sin, and of the worth of mercy; and so upon grounds of right reason, bee willing to alter our condition, and embrace mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon any tearmes it shall please Christ to injoyne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we could grieve and cast <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test sorow can make no satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for sinne.</note> downe our selves beneath the earth, as low as the nethermost pit, yet this would be no satisfaction to God for sin; of it selfe, it is rather an enterance, and beginning of hell.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we must search what is the <note place="margin">Ans. 3.</note> cause of this want of griefe which wee complaine of; whether it be not a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret cleaving to the creature, and too much contentment in it, which oft stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:23925:202"/>
away the heart from God, and brings in such contentment, as is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to faile and deceive us, whereupon from discontentment, wee grieve, which griefe (being carnall) hinders griefe of a better kinde.</p>
               <p>Usually the causes of our want of <note place="margin">Causes of our want of griefe for sinne.</note> griefe for sin are these. First, a want of serious consideration, and dwelling long enough upon the cause of griefe, <note place="margin">1. Want of considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which springs either from an unsetled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Nature, or distractions from things without. Moveable dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are not long affected with any thing. One maine use of crosses, is to <note place="margin">Vse of crosses.</note> take off the soule from that it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously set upon, and to fixe our run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning spirits. For though griefe for cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses hinder spirituall griefe, yet worldly delights hinder more. That griefe is lesse distant from true griefe, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neerer to be turned into it.</p>
               <p>And put case wee could call off our <note place="margin">2. Want of a divine worke.</note> mindes from other things, and set them on griefe for our sinnes, yet it is onely Gods spirit that can worke our hearts to this griefe, and for this end,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:23925:202"/>
perhaps God holds us off from it, to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>each us, that he is the teacher of the heart to grieve. And thereupon it is our duty to waite, till hee reveale our selves so far to our selves, as to stir up this affection in us.</p>
               <p>Another cause may bee a kinde of doublenesse of heart, whereby wee <note place="margin">3. A kinde of doublenes of heart.</note> would bring two things together that cannot suite. We would grieve for sin so far as we thinke it an evidence of a good condition: but then, because it is an irksome taske, and because it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wrought without severing our heart from those sweet delights it is set upon: hence we are loath God should take that course to worke griefe, which crosseth our disposition. The soule must therefore by selfe-deniall be <note place="margin">Selfe-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note> brought to such a degree of <hi>sincerity</hi> and <hi>simplicity,</hi> as to be willing to give God leave to worke <hi>this sorow, not to bee</hi>

                  <hi>sorrowed for,</hi> by what way hee himselfe pleaseth. But here we must remember againe, that this <hi>selfe-deniall,</hi> is not of our selves, but of God, who onely can take us out of our selves, and if our

               <p>God giveth some larger spirits, and so their sorowes become larger. Some <note place="margin">4.</note> upon quicknesse of apprehension, and the ready passages betwixt the braine and the heart, are quickly moved: where the apprehension is deeper, and the passages slower, there sorow is long in working, and long in removing. The deepest waters have the stillest moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Iron takes fire more slowly then stubble, but then it holds it longer.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>God that searcheth and knows our hearts</hi> (better then our selves) <hi>knows</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5. Because God sees not griefe so fit for one dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition as another.</note> 
                  <hi>when and in what measure it is fit for to grieve:</hi> He sees it fitter for some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, to goe on in a constant griefe.

               <p>Some holy men have desired to see <note place="margin">Earnest desire of too much sorow for sin dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note> their sinne in the most ugly colours, and God hath heard them in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests.

For a conclusion then of this point, If wee grieve that we cannot grieve, and so far as it is sinne, make it our griefe: then put it amongst the rest of our sinnes, which we beg pardon of, and helpe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, and let it not hinder us from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christ, but drive us to him.

for <hi>reason</hi> being a beame of God, cannot strengthen any worke of darknesse. God having made man an understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creature, guides him by a way suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to such a condition, and that is the reason why God in mercy yeelds so far to us in his word, as to give us so many reasons of our affiance in him. What is encouragement and comfort, but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration to us of greater reasons to raise us up, then there are to cast us downe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Davids reasons</hi> (here) are drawne partly from some <hi>promise</hi> of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and partly from Gods <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>dealing</hi> with him, <hi>whom,</hi> as he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly found an <hi>healing,</hi> &amp; a <hi>saving God,</hi> so he expects to finde him still; and partly from the <hi>covenant of grace</hi> hee is <hi>my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chiefe of his reasons are fetched from God, what he is in <hi>himselfe,</hi> and what hee is and will be <hi>to his children,</hi> and what to <hi>him</hi> in particular; though godly men have <hi>reasons</hi> for their <hi>trst,</hi> yet those reasons be <hi>divine</hi> and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all as <hi>faith</hi> it selfe is: for as naturally as
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:23925:224"/>
beames come from the Sunne, and branches from the <hi>roote,</hi> even so by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <note place="margin">A godly mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are <hi>divine.</hi>
                  </note> discourse one truth issueth from another. And as the beames and the Sunne, as the roote and branches are all of one nature, so the grounds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable truths, and <hi>reasons</hi> taken from those grounds, are both of same divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and authority, though in time of <hi>temptation</hi> discourse is oft so troubled, that it cannot see how one truth riseth from another; this is one priviledge of <hi>heaven,</hi> that our knowledge there shall not be so much <hi>discoursive,</hi> proving one thing by another, as <hi>definitive,</hi> seeing things in their <hi>grounds</hi> with a more present view: the soule being then rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and enlarged to a present concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of things, and there being no flesh and blood in us, to raise objections that must be satisfied with <hi>reasoning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes in a clearer state of the soule, <hi>faith</hi> hath not so much use of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but upon neere and sweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and by reason of some likenesse betweene the soule that hath a divine nature stamped upon it,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:23925:225"/>
and God, it presently without any long discourse, runneth to God as it were by a supernaturall instinct, as by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall instinct a childe runneth to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any distresse. Yea, and from that common light of nature, which discovereth there is a God, even natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men in extremities will runne to God, and God as the Author of nature will sometimes heare them, as he doth the yong <hi>Ravens</hi> that cry unto him; but comfortably, and with assurance onely those have a familiar recourse unto him, that have a sanctified sutable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position unto God, as being well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him.</p>
               <p>Sometimes againe <hi>faith</hi> is put to it to use reasons to strengthen it selfe, and therefore the soule studieth arguments to help it selfe by, either from inward store laid up in the soule, or else it hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth, and yeelds to reasons sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by others; and there is no gracious heart, but hath a frame sutable and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to any holy and comfortable truth that shall be brought and enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon it; there is something in his
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:23925:225"/>
spirit that answers what ever comes from the spirit of God: though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it never heard of it before, yet it presently claimes kindred of it, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the same blessed Spring, the <hi>

               <p>The <hi>reasons</hi> here brought by <hi>David,</hi> are not so much arguments to convince his <hi>judgement,</hi> as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and inducements to encline his <hi>will</hi> to trust in God, for <hi>trusting</hi> being a holy relying upon God, carieth especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>will</hi> to him; now the <hi>will</hi> is led with the goodnesse of things, as the <hi>understanding</hi> is led with truth; the heart must be sweetned with conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of love and mercy in him whom we trust, as well as convinced of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to doe us good, the cords that draw the heart to trust, are the <hi>cords of love,</hi> and the cords of love are especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the love of him to us whom we love; and therefore the most prevailing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that carie the whole heart, are such as are drawne from the sweetnesse of
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:23925:226"/>
God, whereby the heart is opened and enlarged to expect all good, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but good from him.</p>
               <p>But we must remember that neither <hi>reasons</hi> from the truth and power of God, nor <hi>inducements</hi> or allurements from the goodnesse of God, will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prevaile with the soule, then it hath a fresh light and rellish brought into it by the spirit of God, to discerne of those reasons, and answer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[I will praise him.] David</hi> here minds praising of God more then his owne <hi>delivery,</hi> because he knew his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery was intended on Gods part, that he might be <hi>glorified;</hi> It is an argument of an excellent spirit, when all selfe-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects are drowned in the glory of God; and there is nothing lost therein, for our best being is in God; A Christian begins with loving God for himselfe; but he ends in loving himselfe in and for God, and so his end, and Gods end, and the end of all things else, concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and agree in one; We may ayme at our owne good, so wee bring our

               <p>It rejoyced <hi>David</hi> more, that hee should have a large heart to serve God, then that he should have enlargement of condition. Holy dispositions thinke not so much of the time to come, that it will bee sweet to them, as that it will further Gods praise. True grace raiseth the soule, above selfe-respects, and resteth not till it comes to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ts.</p>
               <p>God is glorified in making us happy, and wee (enjoying happinesse) must glorifie God. Although God conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend so low unto us, as not onely to allow us, but to enjoyne us to looke to

our owne freedome from misery, and enjoyment of happinesse, yet a soule throughly seasoned with <hi>grace,</hi> mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth higher, and is caried with pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects to advance Gods glory; yea som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times so farre, as to forget it owne happinesse, it respects it selfe for God, rather then God for it selfe. A heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly soule is never satisfied, untill it be as neere God as is attaineable. And the neerer a creature comes to God, the more it is emptied of it selfe, and all selfe-aymes. Our happinesse is more in <hi>him,</hi> then in our selves. <hi>Wee seeke our selves most, when we deny our selves most.</hi> And the more wee labour to advance God, the more we advance our owne condition in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[I will praise.] David</hi> thinkes of his owne <hi>duty</hi> in praising God, more then of <hi>Gods worke</hi> in delivering him: Let us thinke of what is our duty, and God will thinke of what shall bee for our comfort; we shall feelse God answering what we looke for from him, in doing what hee expects from us.

               <p>As <hi>David</hi> strengthens his trust in God, by reason fetcht from the future goodnesse of God apprehended by faith, so hee strengthens that reason with another reason fetcht from God, whom he apprehends here as <hi>the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his countenance.</hi> Wee need reason against reason, and reason upon reason, to steele and strengthen the soule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the on-set of contrary reasons.</p>

                  <hi>He is the salvation of my countenance,</hi> that is, He will so save as I shall see, and my enemies shall see it; and upon see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my <hi>countenance</hi> shall bee cheared and lifted up; Gods saving kindnesse shall be read in my countenance, so that all who looke on mee, shall say, God hath spoken peace to my soule, as well as brought peace to my condition.</p>
               <p>He saith not <hi>salvation,</hi> but <hi>salvations:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">That God is not onely sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but salvations to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> because as our life is subject to many miseries, in <hi>soule, body,</hi> and <hi>state,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and private, &amp;c. so God hath ma ny <hi>salvations:</hi> If we have a thousand troubles, he hath a thousand wayes of <note place="margin">Mille mali species, mille salutis erunt</note> help; as he hath more blessings then one, so hee hath more salvations then one. He saves our soules from sin, our bodies from danger, and our estates from trouble. <hi>He is the redeemer of his people,</hi> and not onely so, but with him is <hi>plenteous redemption</hi> of all persons, of <note place="margin">Psal. 130. 7</note> all parts both of body and soule, from all ill, both of sinne and misery, for all times, both now and hereafter. He is an everlasting salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> doth not say, God will save
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:23925:248"/>
me; but God is salvation it self, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but salvation. Our sinnes onely stop the current of his mercy, but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above all our sinnes, will soone scatter that cloud, remove that stop, and then we shall see and feele nothing but salvation from the Lord. <hi>All his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 25. 10</note> 
                  <hi>vayes are mercy and peace</hi> to a repentant soule that casts it selfe upon him.</p>
               <p>Christ himselfe is nothing else but salvation clothed in our <hi>flesh.</hi> So olde <note place="margin">Luke 2. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Simeon</hi> conceived of him, when he had him in <hi>his armes,</hi> and was willing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to yeeld up his spirit to God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving seen Christ the salvation of God: when we embrace Christ in the armes of our Faith, we embrace nothing but salvation. Hee makes up that sweet name given him by his Father, and brought from heaven by an Angell to <note place="margin">Luke 2. 14</note> the full: a name in the Faith of which, it is impossible for any beleeving soule to sinke.</p>
               <p>The devill in trouble presents God to us, as a revenging <hi>destroyer,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe presents him under a false vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; but the skill of <hi>faith</hi> is, to present
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:23925:249"/>
him as a Saviour clothed with salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wee should not so much looke <note place="margin">Thinke of God as a Saviour in trouble.</note> what destruction the devill and his threaten, as what salvation God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth. To God belongs <hi>the issues of death,</hi> and of all other troubles which <note place="margin">Psal. 68. 20.</note> are lesser deathes. Cannot he that hath vouchsafed an issue in Christ from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death, vouchsafe an issue from all temporall evills? If hee will raise our bodies, can he not raise our conditions? He that brought us into trouble, can easily make a way out of it when hee pleaseth. This should bee a ground of resolute and absolute obedience, even in our greatest extremities, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God will either deliver us (from death, or by death, and) at length out of death.</p>
               <p>So then, when we are in any danger, we see whither to goe for salvation, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">Whither to flye in our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</note> to him that is nothing else but <hi>sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> but then we must <hi>trust</hi> in him (as <hi>David</hi> doth) and conceive of him as <hi>salvation,</hi> that we may trust in him. If we will not trust in <hi>salvation,</hi> what will we trust in? and if <hi>salvation</hi> it self can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:23925:249"/>
save us, what can? out of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is nothing but destruction, which those that seeke it any where out of God, are sure to meet with. How pittifull then is their case, who goe to a destroyer for salvation? that seeke for help from hell?</p>
               <p>Here also we see to whom to return <note place="margin">Whom to returne Praise to in all our deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> praise in all our deliverances, even to the God of our salvation. The <hi>virgin Mary</hi> was stirred up to magnifie the Lord, but why? <hi>Her spirit rejoyced in God her Saviour.</hi> Whosoever is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument <note place="margin">Luke 1.</note> of any good, yet salvation is of the Lord; whatsoever brings it, hee sends it. Hence in their holy feasts for any deliverance, the cup they drank of, was called <hi>the Cup of salvation:</hi> and therefore <hi>David</hi> when he summons his thoughts, <hi>what to render unto God?</hi> hee <note place="margin">Ps. 116. 13.</note> resolves upon this, to take <hi>the Cup of salvation.</hi> But alwayes remember this, that when we thinke of God as <hi>salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> wee must thinke of him as hee is in Christ to his. For, so every thing in God is saving, even his most terrible attributes of <hi>justice</hi> and <hi>power:</hi> out of
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:23925:250"/>
Christ, the sweetest things in God are terrible. Salvation it selfe will not save out of Christ; who is the onely <hi>way</hi> of salvation, called the <hi>way,</hi> the <hi>truth,</hi>

light, so many lightsome spirits make the greater light of spirit: and so God receiveth the more praise, which makes him so much to delight in the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his children. Hence it is, that in any deliverance of Gods people, <hi>the righteous doe compasse them about, to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 142. 7</note> know <hi>what God hath done for their soules;</hi> and keep a spirituall Feast with them in partaking of their joy. And the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have cause to joy in the deliverance of other Christians, because they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in their afflictions, and it may be in their sinnes the cause of them, which made them somewhat ashamed. Whence it is, that <hi>Davids</hi> great desire was; that <hi>those who feared God might not</hi>

                  <hi>be ashamed because of him:</hi> insinuating that those who feare Gods name, are ashamed of the falls of Gods people. Now when God delivers them, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach is removed, and those that had part in their sorow, have part in their joy.</p>
               <p>Againe, God will have salvation so open, that it shall appeare in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance <note place="margin">3.</note> of his people, the more to

daunt and vexe the enemies. <hi>Cainish</hi> hypocrites hang downe their heads, when God lifts up the countenance of their brethren; when the countenance of Gods children cleares up, then their enemies hearts and looks are cloudy. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalems joy is Babylons sorow.</hi> It it with the Church &amp; her enemies as it is with a ballance, the scales whereof when one is up the other is downe. Whilst Gods people are under a cloud, carnall people insult over them, as if they were men deserted of God. Wherupon they hang down their heads, &amp; the rather, because they think that by reason of their sins, Christ &amp; his Religion will suffer with them. Hence <hi>Davids</hi> care was, that the <note place="margin">2 Sam. 1. 20.</note> miseries of Gods people <hi>should not be told in Gath.</hi> The chief reason why the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church gnash their teeth at the sight of Gods gracious dealing, is, that they take the rising of the Church, to bee a presage of their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. A lesson which <hi>Hamans</hi> wife had <note place="margin">Esth. 6. 13.</note> learned.</p>
               <p>This is a comfort to us in these times of <hi>Iacobs</hi> trouble and <hi>Zions</hi> sorrow: The
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:23925:252"/>

If there were not great dangers, where were the glory of Gods great deliverance? The Church at length will be as <hi>a Cup of trembling,</hi> and as <hi>a burthensome stone.</hi> The blood of <note place="margin">Zach. 12. 2</note> the Saints cry, their enemies violence cryes, the prayers of the Church cry for deliverance, and vengeance upon the enemies of the Church: and (as that <hi>importunate widow)</hi> will at length pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile.

If there were Armies of Prayers, as there are Armies of men, wee should see the streame of things turned another way. A few <hi>Moses<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="473" facs="tcp:23925:252"/>
God, he would lift up our countenance. But alas, wee either pray not, or crosse our owne prayers for want of love to the truth of God and his people.</p>
               <p>It is wee that keepe Antichrist and his faction alive, to plague the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull world. The strength he hath is not from his owne cause, but from our want of zeale; we hinder those <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Church begins at this time a little to lift up her head again: Now is the time to follow God with prayers, that hee would perfect his owne worke, and plead his owne cause; that he would be revenged not onely of ours, but his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: that he would wholly free his Church from that miserable bondage. These beginnings give our faith some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But it is to be feared, that
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:23925:253"/>
God hath not yet perfected his worke in <hi>Zion.</hi> The Church is not yet fully prepared for a full and glorious delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. If God had once his ends in the humiliation of the Church for sinnes past, with resolution of reformation for the time to come, then this age per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps might <hi>see the salvation of the Lord,</hi> which the generations to come shall be witnesse of: <hi>wee</hi> should see <hi>Zion in her perfect beauty.</hi> The generations of those that came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> saw and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the pleasant land which their proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors were shut out of: who by reason of their murmuring, and looking back to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and forgetfulnesse of the wonders which God had done for, and before them, perished in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse.</p>
               <p>There is little cause therefore of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying the present flourishing of the <note place="margin">Vse</note> enemies of the Church, and of joyning and colluding with them; for it will prove the wisest resolution to resolve to fall and rise with the Church of Christ, considering the enemies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves shall say, God hath done great

fellowship with him. For this end wee were created, and for this redeemed, and for effecting of this, the Word and Sacraments are sanctified to us, yea, and for this end God himselfe (out of the bowels of his compassion) vouchsafed to enter into a gracious covenant with us, founded upon Jesus Christ, and his satisfaction to divine justice; so that by Faith wee become one with him, and receive him, as offered of his Father to <hi>be all in all to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is, that CHRIST hath his name <hi>Immanuel, God with us.</hi> Not onely <note place="margin">Why <hi>Christ</hi> hath his name <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel.</hi>
                  </note> because hee is <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>man</hi> too, (both natures meeting in one person) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause being God in our nature, he hath undertooke this office to bring God and us together. The maine end of Christs comming and suffering, was to reconcile, and to gather together in one; and (as <hi>Peter</hi> expresseth it) <hi>to bring man againe to God. Immanuel</hi> is the bond <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 18</note> of this happy agreement, and appeares for ever in heaven to make it good. As the comfort hereof is great, so the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it is sure and everlasting, God
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:23925:255"/>
will be our God, <hi>so long</hi> as he is Christs God; and <hi>because</hi> hee is Christs God. <note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 10.</note> Thus the Father of the faithfull, and all other holy men before Christ, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended God to be their God in the <hi>Messias</hi> to come. Christ was the ground of their interest. Hee was <hi>yesterday</hi> to them as well as <hi>to day</hi> to us. Hence it is that God is called the <hi>portion</hi> of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">Heb. 13. Psa. 73. 26. Mal. 3. 25. Psal. 71.</note> and they his <hi>jewels:</hi> he their onely <hi>rock</hi> and <hi>strong Tower,</hi> and they his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ones.</p>
               <p>Well may we wonder that the great <note place="margin">Vse</note> God should stoope so low, to enter into such a covenant of grace and peace, founded upon such a Mediator, with such utter enemies, base creatures, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dust and ashes as we are. This is the wonderment of Angels, a torment of devils, and glory of our nature and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; and will be matter of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">That there must be on our part an appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of God, as he tenders himselfe to be our God.</note> and praising God unto us for all eternity.</p>
               <p>As God offereth himselfe to be ours in Christ (else durst we lay no claime to him) so there must be in us an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating grace of <hi>faith,</hi> to lay hold of
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:23925:256"/>
this offer. <hi>David</hi> saith here, <hi>My God.</hi> But by what spirit? by a spirit of <hi>faith,</hi> which looking to Gods offer, maketh it his owne whatsoever it layes hold of God offereth himselfe in covenant, and Faith catcheth hold thereon presently. With a gracious offer of God, there go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a gracious touch of his spirit to the soule, giving it sight and strength, whereby (being ayded by the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) it layeth hold on God shewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in love. God saith to the soule, <hi>I am thy salvation,</hi> and the soule saith againe, <hi>Thou art my God. Faith is nothing else, but a spirituall eccho, returning that voice bark againe, which God first speakes to the soule.</hi> For what acquaintance could the soule claime with so glorious a Majesty, if he should not first condescend so low, as to speake peace, and whisper secretly to the soule, that he is <hi>our</hi> loving God and Father, and <hi>wee</hi> his peculiar ones in Christ, that our sinnes are all pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his justice fully satisfied, and our persons freely accepted in his deere Sonne.</p>
               <p>But to come more particularly to
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:23925:256"/>
the words <hi>[My God]</hi> The words are pregnant; in the wombe of them, all that is graciously &amp; comfortably good is contained; they are the spring head of all particular blessings. All particular <hi>Relations</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> that it pleaseth God to take upon him, have their strength from hence, that God is <hi>our God.</hi> More cannot be said, and lesse will not serve the turne. Whatsoever else we have, if we have not God; it will prove but an <hi>empty Cisterne</hi> at last. He is our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per element, every thing desires to live in its owne element, fishes in the Sea, Birds in the ayre; in this they are best preserved.</p>
               <p>There is a greater strength in this <hi>[My God]</hi> then in any other Title, it is more then if he had said My <hi>King,</hi> or My <hi>Lord;</hi> these are words of soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and wisdome; but this implies not onely infinite power, soveraignty, and wisdome, but likewise infinite <hi>bounty</hi> and provident care; so that when wee are said to be <hi>Gods people,</hi> the meaning is, that wee are not onely such over whom God hath a power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:23925:257"/>
but such as towards whom hee shewes a <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>peculiar respect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the words is implied, 1. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and interest in God. 2. An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement <note place="margin">1.</note> of the same for the quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">2.</note> of the soule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> (here) layes a <hi>particular</hi> claim, <note place="margin">Particular faith ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and why.</note> by a particular <hi>faith</hi> unto God. The reason, is, 1. The vertue of <hi>faith</hi> is as to lay hold, so to appropriate to it self, <note place="margin">1.</note> and make <hi>its owne</hi> whatever it layes hold on, and it doth no more in this, then God gives it leave by his gracious promises to doe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As God offers, so <hi>faith</hi> receives, but God offers himselfe in <hi>particular</hi> to the <note place="margin">2.</note> beleeving soule by his spirit, therefore our faith must be particular. That which the Sacraments seale, is a <hi>peculiar</hi> interest in Christ; This is that which hath alwayes upheld the Saints of God, and that which is ever joyned with the life of Christ in us. <hi>The life that I live</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) is by the faith of the Sonne of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>God, who loved me, and gave himselfe for me.</hi> The spirit of faith is a spirit of application.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="483" facs="tcp:23925:257"/>
This is implyed in all the <hi>Articles</hi> of our faith; we beleeve God to be <hi>our</hi> father, and Christ to be <hi>borne for us,</hi> that he <hi>dyed</hi> for us, and <hi>rose againe</hi> for our good, and now sits at the right hand of God, making requests <hi>for us</hi> in particular.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is that which distinguishes the faith of a true Christian, from all <note place="margin">3.</note> hypocrites and cast-awayes whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.

               <p>Some think the Martyrs were too prodigall of their bloud, and that they might have beene better advised; but such are unacquainted with the force of the love of God kindled in the heart of his childe, which makes him set such a high price upon Christ and his truth, that he counts not <hi>his life dear unto him;</hi>

                  <p>And shall not wee bee bold to say so after Christ hath taught us, and put this claime into our mouthes? If once we let this hold goe, then Sathan hath us where he would, every little crosse then dejects us.

We shall never finde God to be our God more, then when for making of him to be so, we suffer any thing for his sake. Wee enjoy never more of him then then.</p>
                  <p>At the <hi>first</hi> we may seeke to him, as rich to supply our wants, as a Physitian to cure our soules and bodies, but here

wee must not rest till wee come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in him as our friend, and from thence rise to an admiration of him for his owne excellencies, that being so high in himselfe, out of his goodnesse would stoop low to us. And we should delight in the meditation of him, not onely as good to us, but as good in himselfe; because goodnesse of bounty springs from goodnesse of disposition, <hi>he doth good because he is good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A naturall man delights more in Gods gifts, then in his grace.

                  <p>In this conflicting state, every prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple labouring to maintaine it selfe, at length by helpe of the spirit, backing and strengthening his owne worke, <hi>grace</hi> gets the better, keeping nature within bounds, and suppressing corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this the soule (so farre as it is spirituall) doth by gathering it selfe to it selfe, and by reasoning the case so farre, till it concludes, and joynes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this issue, that the onely way to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:23925:299"/>
sound peace, is (when all other meanes faile) to <hi>trust in God.</hi> And thereupon he layes a charge upon his soule so to doe, is being a course groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the highest reason, even the unchangeable goodnesse of God, who out of the riches of his mercy, having chosen a people in this world, which should be to the glory of his mercy, will give them matter of setting forth his <hi>praise,</hi> in shewing some token of <hi>good</hi> upon them, as being those on whom he hath fixed his love, and to whom hee will appeare not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Saviour,</hi> but <hi>salvation</hi> it selfe. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but salvation;</hi> as the Sunne is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but light, so whatsoever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from him to them, tends to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther salvation. All his wayes towards them leade to that; which wayes of his, though for a time they are secret, and not easily found out, yet at length God will be wonderfull in them to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of his enemies themselves, who shall be forced to say, God hath done great things for them; and all from this ground, that God is <hi>our God</hi>
                     <pb n="568" facs="tcp:23925:300"/>
                     <hi>in covenant.</hi> Which words are a stearne that rule and guide the whole text.</p>
                  <p>For why should we not be <hi>disquieted</hi> when we are disquieted? Why should we not be <hi>cast downe</hi> when we are cast downe? Why should we <hi>trust</hi> in God as a Saviour? but that he is <hi>[our God,]</hi> making himselfe so to us in his choisest favours: doing that for us, which none else can doe, and which he doth to none else that are not his in a gracious maner. This blessed interest and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course betwixt Gods spirit and our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, is the hindge upon which all turns: without this, no comfort is comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; with this, no trouble can be very trouble some.</p>
                  <p>Without this assurance there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle comfort in Soliloquies; unlesse, when we speake to our selves, wee can speake to God as <hi>ours.</hi> For in desperate cases, our soule can say nothing to it selfe, to still it selfe, unlesse it be sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by God; Discouragements will appeare greater to the soule then any comfort, unlesse God comes in as ours.</p>
                  <p>See therefore <hi>Davids art,</hi> hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:23925:300"/>
of himselfe why hee was so cast downe? The cause was apparant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was troubles <hi>without,</hi> and terrours <hi>within,</hi> and none to comfort, Well, grant this saith the spirit of God <note place="margin">Soliloquie.</note> in him (as the worst must be granted) yet saith the Spirit, <hi>Trust in God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So I have.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why then, waite in trusting? <hi>Light is sowen for the righteous,</hi> it comes not upon the suddaine, we must not think to sowe and reape both at once. If trouble be lengthened, lengthen thy patience.</p>
                  <p>What good will come of this?</p>
                  <p>God will waite to doe thee that good, for which <hi>thou shalt praise him;</hi> he will deale so graciously with thee, as he will deserve thy praise, he will <hi>shew thee</hi> his <hi>salvation.</hi> And new favours will stirre thee up to sing new songs: every new recovery of our selves or friends, is as it were a new life, and ministers new matter of praise. And upon offering this <hi>sacrifice of praise,</hi> the heart is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enlarged to pray for fresh blessings. Wee are never fitter to <hi>pray,</hi> then after <hi>praise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="570" facs="tcp:23925:301"/>
                     <hi>But in the meane time I hang down my head, whilest mine enemies carie themselves highly, and my friends stand aloofe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God in his owne time (which is best for thee) will be <hi>the salvation of thy countenance;</hi> he will compasse thee about with songs of deliverance, and make it appeare at last, that he hath care of thee.</p>
                  <p>But why then doth God appeare as a stranger to me?</p>
                  <p>That thou shouldst follow after him with the stronger <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>prayer,</hi> hee withdrawes himself, that thou shouldst bee the more earnest in seeking after him. God speakes the sweetest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the heart in the <hi>wildernesse.</hi> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily thou art not yet low enough, nor purged enough. Thy affections are not throughly crucified to the world, and therefore it will not yet appeare that it is Gods good will to deliver thee. Wert thou a fit subject of mercy, God would bestow it on thee.</p>
                  <p>But what ground hast thou to build thy selfe so strongly upon God?</p>
                  <p>He hath offered, and made himselfe
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:23925:301"/>
to be <hi>[My God,]</hi> and so hath shewed himselfe in former times; And I have made him <hi>My God,</hi> by yeelding him his Soveraignty in my heart. Besides the present evidence of his blessed spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, clearing the same, and many pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar tokens of his love, which I daily doe enjoy; though sometimes the beams of his favour are eclipsed. Those that are <hi>Gods,</hi> besides their interest and right in him, have oft a sense of the same even in this life, as a fore-taste of that which is to come. To the seale of <hi>grace</hi> stamped upon their hearts, God super-adds a fresh seale of <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> by the presence and witnesse of his <hi>Spirit.</hi> And shewes likewise some outward token for good upon them, whereby he makes it appeare, that <hi>hee hath set a part him that is godly for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 4. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>as his owne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus we see that discussing of obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the consistory of the soule, settles the soule at last. <hi>Faith</hi> at length silencing all risings to the contrary. All motion tends to rest, and ends in it; God is the center and resting place of
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:23925:302"/>
the soule, and here <hi>David</hi> takes up his rest, and so let us. Then whatsoever times come, wee are sure of a hiding place and Sanctuary.</p>
