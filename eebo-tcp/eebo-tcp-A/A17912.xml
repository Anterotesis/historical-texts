         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We would thinke that man to be ſenceleſſe, who (taking his enimies counſel) would ſhutt all his doores &amp; windowes, in hope to get the more light into his houſe thereby. The devil dayly makes many thouſand worſe fooles in the world, in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to ſhutt cloſe their eyes against the ſaving light of the Goſpell, in exſpectation that their ſoules by this meanes ſhalbe filled with the more wiſedom and ſpiritual vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. It is not my meaning, that any one ſhould beleeve<note place="margin">Prov. 14. 15</note> things ſuddenly &amp; raſhly, but I would have him as Salomons counſell is, <hi>to looke wel to his going;</hi> and as we take gould by weight, Corne, Cloth, &amp;c. by meaſure, ſo to receive the doctrines of every man by due examination; And this is onely the thing which I doe request of thee (good reader) whoſoever thou art, be thou but pleaſed to put the <hi>Principles &amp; infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences</hi> here written, vpon <hi>their proof,</hi> &amp; to hold <hi>that only faſt,</hi> which (after good triall by the ſcriptures) <hi>thou findeſt to be good</hi> and it is ſufficient, and I have my deſire of thee to the full.</p>
            <p>One thing more I deſire others to take notice of, namely, That I judge not my ſelf bound ſo much, to justifie their <hi>Principles,</hi> as our <hi>Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> from them. Jf therefore any ſhall deny them to be true, my purpoſe is to give place to ſuch, whome it more nearly concerneth to write in the defence thereof.<note n="‡" place="margin">Yet we beleeve their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to be true, &amp; iſ there be no Nonc. that will defend them, we will.</note> But if any ſhall oppoſe vs in the <hi>Concluſions,</hi> I would have them (leaving all by matters) to follow the truth in love, without gall and bitterneſſe, that ſo things may come to a happy and ſpeedy iſſue.

the day of <hi>ordination</hi> is com, after an exhortation made, and the communion celebrated, the <hi>Epistle &amp; Goſpell</hi> read, and the <hi>Hymne veni creator</hi> ſung, or ſayd, the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon</hi> preſents to the <hi>B.</hi> all thoſe that are to take on the order of Prieſthood that day, with theſe words, <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Father in Christ, I preſent to you the perſons here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to be admitted to the order of Priesthood.</hi> Then after ſome demaunds and anſweres, of the <hi>B.</hi> and the other, who are to be admitted, he demaundeth of the people, who are preſent there, if they know any impediment, which may hinder any of theſe preſent to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to the order of Prieſthood, which is a manifcſt mockage. For it may be, that none there preſent either heard or ſaw any of them, or all of them before that day, &amp;c. Then after the oath of the <hi>Kengs ſupremacie</hi> is taken, there followes an exhortation again, with other demaunds and anſweres. After this the people, who are preſent, are deſired ſecretly to commend the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to God: For which cauſe they are all ſilent for a little ſpace.

Now as well may they imitate his breathing, as to vſurpe theſe words. Is any of their curats after the pronouncing of theſe words either the holyer or more apt to teach: And whereas he puts a Bible into their hands, he might rather put their ſervice booke: for either they are ignorant and cannot preach, or if they can, yet may not, till they procure by mony a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence<note place="margin">Alt. dam. 165.</note> from them.

                  <hi>I could produce many others of them, which affirm the ſame thing, but it needs not, ſeeing enough hereof hath beene allready ſpoken. Notwithſtanding it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be amiſſe to ſett downe the words of one more: becauſe the</hi> Author <hi>was a</hi> Nonconformiſt <hi>of note: gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally well beloved, and not undeſervedly: now thus he ſayth,</hi> What a miſerable pickle are our miniſters in, when they are vrged to give an account of their calling: to a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt indeed they can give a ſhifting anſwer, that they have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination from Biſhops, which Biſhops were ordained by other Biſhops, and they or their ordayners by Popiſh Biſhops, this in part may stop the mouth of a Papiſt: But let a Proteſtant, which doubteth of theſe matters, move the queſtion: &amp; what then will they ſay? if they fly to Popiſh Biſhops, as they are Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, then let them goe no longer maſked vnder the name of Proteſtants: If they alledge ſucceſsion by them from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, then to (ſay nothing of the appropriating of this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion vnto the Popes chaire, in whoſe name, and by whoſe authority our Engliſh Biſhops did all things in times past) then I ſay they muſt take a great time for the ſatisfying of a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17543:17"/>
poore man concerning this question, and for the justifying of their ſtation: For vntill that out of good records they can ſhew a perpetuall ſucceſſion from the Apoſtles vnto their Dioceſan, which ordained them, and vntill they can make the poore man, which doubteth perceive the truth and certainty of theſe records (which I wiſſe they will doe at leaſure) they<note place="margin">Preface Dioceſ.

If to the preſent Biſhops and Archbiſhops, alas! they are as farre to ſeeke as the other. <hi>The effect of his ſpeach is: that thoſe which receive their miniſterie from the Prelates (as all doe in the church of England) they can not any way juſtifie the ſame to be lawfull; For howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may ſay, this or that in the defence of it: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, it is all either falſhood or</hi> vanitie, <hi>which they ſay, and herein doe wholy deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and every one that beleeveth them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus much in generall be ſpoken concerning the ſecond point; namely, the differences manifeſted by the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> betweene a true <hi>miniſterie,</hi> and the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> as alſo their judgment of it, that it is <hi>Popiſh &amp; falſe,</hi> and the many reaſons, which they ſhew to prove the ſame. Now in this we and they doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo accord, and our difference ſtands onely in practice; For they thinke (as it ſeemes) that a people may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate lawfully in a <hi>falſe ministery:</hi> But our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice is otherwiſe, both which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take here to prove. 1 <hi>by ſcripture.</hi> 2 <hi>by reaſons.</hi> 3 <hi>by the teſtimony of the Learned:</hi> And ſo we come to the

                  <hi>Other Teſtimonies I could alleage, but it needs not; For the Nonconformiſts affirme as much:</hi> We may not <hi>(ſay they)</hi> adventure to goe vnto him for thoſe things, which he hath no commiſsion to deliver. <hi>Another ſayth, that whoſoever preacheth by an unlawfull calling:</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:17543:19"/>
ought not to be heard, although he ſpeaketh the truth, no more then the devill was to be ſuffered, although he profeſſed Chriſt. As the firmeneſſe of the ſeale, ſtandeth not in the print or forme it maketh: but ſpecially that it be ſett on by one that hath authority therevnto: So much more it is in the caſe of the Sacraments: for to receive the ſame in a falſe miniſtery, is to deny Gods miniſtery, and to give the glory of<note place="margin">Note.</note> it there, where he hath not given it: and to deprive our ſelves of this comfort; that our hearts may ſay: Gods ſolemne<note place="margin">Fenner Doct. upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sacra<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 127.</note> voyce ſpeaketh, his ſolemne hand offereth and giveth, which is here the lively ſtay of our fayth.</p>
               <p>By this it appeareth, that the daunger is marvelous great, to communicate in a falſe miniſtery, a man would pull a ſore puniſhment upon his head, if he ſhould have a hand to putt by a Princes lawfull officer (whether <hi>Iudge, Mayor, Bayliefe,</hi> &amp;c.) and ſett up a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> in the roome thereof, and come to him for juſtice. He that receives in a falſe miniſtery <hi>denies Gods miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> ſayth the former Author; And ſo puts a traitor in his place, and takes the holy things from the handes of a traitor, which is a fearfull tranſgreſſion, and ſurely will procure extreame wrath, without true and ſound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. From all that hath beene before ſpoken, we may here frame this Argument.</p>
               <p>None may heare or joyn in ſpirituall communion with that miniſtery, which hath not a true vocation and calling: by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, approbation, and ordination of that faithfull people, where he is to administer. But the preſent miniſtery of the eccleſiasticall aſſemblies of England hath not a true voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and calling, by election, approbation, and ordination of a
<pb facs="tcp:17543:20"/>
faithfull people, where they adminiſter. Therefore none may hear or joyne in ſpirituall communion, with the preſent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie of the Eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies of England.</p>
               <p>Which of the propoſitions the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> will deny I know not: but ſure I am, they are both <hi>Theirs:</hi> Howbeit (it may be) they doe not ſo well weigh their owne principles, as they ſhould; And hence it is, that their practice is not ſtrictly anſwereable to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and therefore doe give juſt occaſion (I ſpeake it with greife) unto the <hi>Prelates</hi> and their <hi>Paraſites,</hi> to inſinuate againſt them, hypocriticall ends, in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo greivouſly the <hi>miniſtery, worſhip &amp; government of the Engliſh Church,</hi> and yet to partake in the knowne evills and abuſes thereof. But for my part I am other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe minded then the <hi>Biſhops</hi> in this thing, and doe thinke, that they doe of conſcience condemne the ſtate of that Church: But doe not maturely conſider the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſive concluſions,</hi> which follow upon their <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</hi>

                  <hi>A dumb miniſterie beeing vnlawfull and falſe, is to be ſeperated from: their miniſters for the greateſt part are dumb miniſters: therefore it is lawfull to ſeperate from the greatest part of their miniſters.</hi> The propoſition is manifeſt and cleare, and I dare ſay they will not deny it: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides

the reaſons already given, it is confidently by them affirmed that a <hi>reading miniſtery cannot deliver the Lords holy ſeales vnto the people without great ſacrilege, nor the people, receive at the hands of ſuch without dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſinnes,</hi> and whoſoever liſteth to read the place, he<note place="margin">Exhor.

               <p>The aſſumption I prove alſo by their owne teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: For they ſay, that <hi>generally throughout the Land</hi>

               </p>

               <p>He that ſhould come to a deepe pitt or wel, wherein doe lye many people, almoſt periſhed, if he ſhould ſee there, ſome of them com forth from the reſt, would we not judge him an unmercifull and cruell man, if he ſhould rather ſeeke to caſt them in againe, then to help out the other behind in miſerie: Such as live under a

               <p>Secondly, for the work which theſe <hi>idle readers</hi> doe, we ſhall have a fit place herafter to ſpeak of it.

               </p>
               <p>Thus much for their <hi>dumb ministerie.</hi> It followes next, that we ſpeak of their <hi>parſons, vicars, pariſh preiſts, stipendaries, and chaplines.</hi> If you will know (ſay the Nonconformiſts) whence all theſe came, we can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily<note place="margin">Admo. p. 15, 16.</note> anſwere you, that <hi>they came from the Pope, as out of the Trojan horſes belly to the destruction of Gods Kingdom,</hi> It is certaine, that their names and office is wholy<note place="margin">Sol.

world know them. Theſe are clouds without raine, trees without fruit, painted ſepulchres, full of dead bones, fatted in all abundance of iniquity; Such as ſeeke not the Lord Ieſus, but their owne bellies.</p>
               <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

               <p>
                  <hi>Here is enough ſpoken for the condemnation of their calling, and for the juſtification of ſeperation from all communion therewith: From hence I might frame this argument,</hi> Whoſoever he be that dealeth with the holy thinges of God, and worketh vpon the conſciences of men, by vertue of an Antichriſtian power, office, and calling, him the people of God ought not to receive, or joyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves vnto.

               <p>The firſt part of this reaſon the Nonconformiſts do yeeld willingly unto, as it is to be ſeen in a <hi>Treatiſe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Mr. Fr.

                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:17543:28"/>
                  <hi>But to keepe them to their owne grounds, in the aſſumption: I will here lay downe another argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> If their parſons, vicars, pariſh Preiſts, ſtipendaries &amp;c.

               <p>It may be ſome will exſpect that I ſhould write ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their <hi>Lecturers:</hi> And the rather, becauſe they in the judgment of many, are thought to be the beſt <hi>miniſters,</hi> of their life and doctrine I ſay nothing: but as for their miniſterie ſurely it is <hi>new</hi> and ſtrange, as <hi>King Iames,</hi> was wont to ſay of it.

wholy to the Scriptures, &amp; I thinke never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard of till in theſe later broken and confuſed times.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is no marvaile, when the queſtion hath<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.</note> been propounded to ſome of them, as it was by the <hi>Phariſes,</hi> to <hi>Iohn, Who art thou?</hi> that they have not been able for their life to anſwere the point, neither could agree among themſelves, what <hi>kind of ministerie</hi> it is that they have taken up; and beeing hard preſſed for reſolution, they have ingeniouſly confeſſed, that unleſſe they be <hi>Evangelists,</hi> they could not ſee how their <hi>miniſtery</hi> doth accord with any <hi>ministerie</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> This I write upon my owne certaine knowledge, the perſons I thinke are yet liveing, whoſe names for ſome reaſon I forbeare to expreſſe.

               <p>I doe not thinke it ſtrange, that they ſhould thus ſpeake: For indeed, I know not what they can ſay better in defence of their ſtanding; <hi>Paſtors,</hi> I am ſure, they will not ſay they are. For firſt they doe not take any particular charge of a flock upon them. 2. They performe not the office thereof: For they agree with the people only, to preach, &amp; not to adminiſter, either the ſeales, or cenſures to them. 3. Their comming unto the people is in a ſtrange ſort: for they make a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant each with other, for ſome certaine yeares; and when that time is out, both parties are free, and ſo may leave one the other, and doe many times. But a true Paſtor may not doe ſo; For if he ſhould he were

He that is the <hi>parſon</hi> or <hi>vicar,</hi> is taken generally for the miniſter of the place; And truly howſoever their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be falſe and Antichriſtian (as the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> ſay) yet in many reſpects they doe better reſemble a true miniſter, then any Lecturer whatſoever; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not without juſt cauſe doe the <hi>Reformists</hi> utterly condemne this <hi>extraordinarie office of preachers,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme,<note place="margin">Neceſ. diſc. 74.</note> that they are neither <hi>Paſtors</hi> or <hi>Teachers,</hi> which the ſcripture alloweth off. And this may be eaſily proved.</p>
               <p>That miniſterie which is inſtituted and ſett vp beſides thoſe, which God hath appointed in his word, is vnlawfull and falſe: But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he miniſterie of the Lecturers in England is inſtituted and ſett vp beſide theſe, which God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his word. Therefore that ministerie is vnlawfull and falſe. <hi>The propoſition is plain and undeniable, and we have their owne words to confirme it; For thus they ſay:</hi> All the miniſtery is by the word of God, and not left to the will of men, to deviſe at their pleaſure, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by that which is noted of Iohn, where the Phariſees com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to him, after that he had denyed to be either Chriſt, or Eltas, or another Prophet, conclude if he be neither Christ, nor Elias, nor of the Prophets, why Baptiſeſt thou? which had been no good argument, if Iohn might have been of ſom other function then of thoſe which were ordinary in the church, and inſtituted of God, and therefore Iohn to eſtabliſh his ſingular and extraordinarie function, allegeth the word
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17543:31"/>
of God, whereby appeareth, that as it was not lawfull to bring-in any ſtrange Doctrine, ſo was it not lawfull to teach<note place="margin">Mind this ye Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</note> the true Doctrine, vnder the name of any other function then was inſtituted by God. Let the whole practice of the church vnder the Law be looked vpon, and it ſhall not be found, that any other eccleſiasticall miniſtery was appointed then thoſe officers of high Prieſt, &amp; Preiſts &amp; Levites, &amp;c. which were appointed by the Law of God, and if there were any rayſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily, the ſame had their calling confirmed from heaven, either by ſignes or miracles, or by plain and cleare te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the mouth of God, or by extraordinarie exciting &amp; movings of the ſpirit of God. So that it appeareth, that the miniſtery of the Goſpell, and the function thereof, ought to be from heaven and of God, and not invented by the braine of men: From heaven I ſay, and heavenly, becauſe although it<note place="margin">T.

               <p>Againe, to deviſe any other miniſtery then that which God hath appointed, is condemned by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond commaundement.</p>
               <p>The aſſumption is thus proved, firſt if their <hi>Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> have taken ordination from the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe by that power onely then is their office falſe by the reaſons before laid downe. Secondly if it be objected that they never received the <hi>Prelates orders,</hi> or have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented thereof; I anſwere, yet this proves not that they are therefore true miniſters: For as <hi>Iehu,</hi> though
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17543:31"/>
he did wel to ſuppreſſe, <hi>Ahabs idolatrie,</hi> yet in that he <hi>followed the wayes of Ieroboam,</hi> he himſelfe continued ſtill a groſſe idolater. Even ſo, howſoever ſom may privately report, that they ſtand miniſters by no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Biſhop: yet are they notwithſtanding, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull miniſters, ſeeing they were never elected cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, and ordained according to Gods word: If any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that they have their calling of the people. I anſwere the thing is ſurely otherwiſe, as ſhall be manifeſted preſently. But if this were granted, yet I deny that any Church vnder heaven, hath power from Chriſt to ordaine ſuch a kind of miniſterie, and therefore if any people ſhould doe it, ſeeing it is againſt the Scripture, it muſt needs follow that it is an <hi>vnlawfull ministery,</hi> &amp; ſo conſequently not to be communicated with, and that it is ſo I prove it thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That miniſtery is vnlawfull which none may lawfully give, but none may lawfully beſtow the miniſterie of a lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Demonſ. diſ, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Therefore that miniſterie is unlawfull.</hi> The propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is evident by their owne <hi>principles:</hi> The aſſumption cannot for ſhame be denyed if the nature of it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. For as we but even now ſayd, their <hi>Lecturers</hi> take no charge of a flock vpon them, they make cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the people but for a certaine time, the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar works of a miniſter is not by the people laid vpon them, neither exſpected of them: If any object that they preach the word; To this Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> gives an anſwere fully, that the preaching of the goſpell is not a worke peculiar to a miniſter: For ſuch as are private men and out of office, may and ought to preach

And for this we have the teſtimony of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

               <p>And ſo much <hi>D.

Burgeſſe, <hi>whereas the Nonconformiſts ſay the calling of their Biſhops, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the miniſters is Antichriſtian, that ſeparation muſt herevpon neceſſarily follow.</hi> How is this anſwered? not at al: if the proverbe be true: <hi>as good never a whit, as never the better.</hi> For <hi>D.

If therefore he would have anſwered the <hi>rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> charge indeed, he ſhould have proved that thoſe miniſters, whoſe <hi>calling doth eſſencially depend vpon the Biſhops calling:</hi> which have, I ſay, no other election nor ordination, but what they had from them, in a word, which doe adminiſter to the people only by that power and authority, may (notwithſtanding for for all this) warrantably by ſcripture be judged true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, &amp; be lawfully co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated with in their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, &amp; yet the <hi>Nonconformiſts grounds,</hi> publiſhed againſt them, all juſt, true &amp; good. This is the very point indeed: for ſuch miniſters we have onely left, and we know no other. If there be, let them be manifeſted to

us; tell us their names, their places; And if we finde by ſcripture their miniſterie to be lawfull, we will ſurely have communion with it, as occaſion ſerves. Till then, we purpoſe by Gods grace to live as we doe, and to practiſe that which the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> profeſſe to be the order, and way which the Lord commaunds all his ſervants to walke in.</p>

But it may be they would ſay ſome congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations doe not <hi>ordaine their miniſters;</hi> to this the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates might reply, that is then their fault; For they give liberty and power to all alike, and that is none at all; I am ſory they have laid ſuch a ſnare, whereby to undoe themſelves.

For if God be perfectly wiſe, then he knew best what worſhip would pleaſe himſelfe; and if he be perfectly good, then he would reveale vnto vs, what ever he knew fit for vs to practice: A gaine it is a great injurie offered to God, when we will let his deadly enimies have the ordering and<note place="margin">Note.</note> appointing of his ſervice rather then himſelfe.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17543:48"/>
The matters he vrged were but circumſtantiall, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and variable, and ſuch as the best Kings, having the Lords approbation, had changed before. They could ſay that the worſhip was the ſame in ſubstance, that they ſerved the ſame God who brought them out of Egypt, with the ſacrifices and obſervation of all the ſtatutes kept by all the fathers ſince the beginning of the world. That their Bullocks, which Preciſians called idols, were ſimilitudes repreſenting the onely ſacrifice of the Meſſiah, in whom they looked for ſalvation. Were there not Cherubines in the Tabernacle and Temple, and twelve Oxen or Buls of braſse appointed by the wiſest King? The Lord forbiddeth ſuch images onely as have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip done vnto them; like the Calſe in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, turning the glory of God into the ſimilitude of a bullock that eateth graſſe. But they could ſay, that they worſhipped not theſe Calves more then the images of the Cherubines. Are we ſo groſſe when we ſay, <hi>Behold our Gods,</hi> as to think that they brought vs out of Egypt? We ſpeake figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, as the Arke was called the <hi>King of Glorie,</hi> and <hi>the holy Lord God.</hi> Wee will rather give our lives, lands, libertie and all, then commit Idolatry for the pleaſure of any Prince; and doe abhorre the abuſe of Images, which is to bow down and ſerve them; albeit we be not of that mind but we may have them and worſhip God by them; becauſe we know no place of Scripture to the contrary. The place of worſhip is but a circumſtance; and to tie Gods preſence to any place, who is neere in all times and places to them that call upon him, is ſuperſtition. The Arke was not ever in one place but often removed. In <hi>Salomons</hi> own time there was two publick places of Gods worſhip, and <hi>Salomon</hi> ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17543:48"/>
in them both. Is not the whole land holy? The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to <hi>Salomon</hi> of a ſpeciall preſence at Ieruſalem, was tyed to the condition of keeping his Statutes and Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherein he hath failed. And therefore as his Throne is thrown down, which the Lord at the ſame time promiſed to eſtabliſh, ſo hath the place lost the priviledge of holineſſe. We may plead from Antiquity: for heere is <hi>Bethel,</hi> ſo famous for that glorious teſtimony of his preſence given to <hi>Iacob,</hi> from whom we this day have the name of Iſrael, <hi>Rehoboam</hi> is no wiſer then his father, he may fall into his Idolatry, and ſo Iſrael by reſorting to Ieruſalem may be ſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. All danger of Idolatry would be prevented, the poore people eaſed of their tedious journies, and both Prince and people ſaved from <hi>Rhehoboams</hi> conſpiracy. All this dinne and diviſion proceedeth of the humours of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious and avaritious Levits, ſeducing the ſimple people, making them to thinke that God cannot be ſerved but in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, after their faſhion in every circumſtance and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ceremony: and of the doting of ſome perſons of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt wit and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ox, delighting to goe abroad, to be talked of for zeale, and more pleaſed with any worſhip then that which they have at home. The obſervation of the Feaſt of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles vpon the <hi>15</hi> day of the <hi>8</hi> month, is but the change of a circumſtance of time. The day was made for man, and not man for the day. It was lawfull by Gods own warrant to keep the Paſseover on the <hi>14</hi> day of the ſecond month; he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not for the month ſo the day be kept. It is preſumption to alter things ſubſtantiall in matters of faith or doctrine: but ſuperſtition to stand vpon circumſtances and variable ceremonies. What can be done, the Lords worſhip cannot
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17543:49"/>
be neglected. If the Prieſts of Levi make it nice, will ſtill prove contentious, and lead a faction with them for ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> vpon warrant of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, before the diſtinction of <hi>Levi</hi> was made for orders ſake, others of other Tribes, as well qualified as themſelves, muſt be put in their places, and they put away as <hi>Abiathar</hi> was by <hi>Salomon,</hi> becauſe he had his hand with <hi>Adonijah.</hi> It may be when they ſee their places well filled, and the charity of profuſe people, which cannot last long, to decay, that their gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines will go away, and they returne to their right wits. The Prophet that came to the King when his hand dryed vp, might have beene a Witch comming with lying wonders, for he was ſlaine by a Lyon: and howſoever he threatned deſtruction, he condeſcended vpon no time, lest he ſhould have been convinced of a lye. <hi>Ahijah</hi> dealt not with the King in meekneſſe and ſincerity as became a Prophet; but by his bitterneſſe and paſſion declared that he was partially inclyned to <hi>Iudah. Abijah</hi> dyed not before his day. All things come a like to the godly and to the wicked, to him that ſacrificeth and him that ſacrificeth not. Or if his death was vntimous, it was rather for his ſecret intentious croſsing his fathers courſes, then for any good that was in him towards the God of Iſrael, as the Prophet would have it.</p>

This<note place="margin">Per.

from all which this argument may be framed: <hi>That worſhip, in which a man cannot poſſibly communicate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne, he is bound neceſſarily to ſeparate frrom: but that worſhip, in which theſe Idols are made and vſed (viz.) the ſurpluſſe, croſſe, and kneeling, a man cannot poſſibly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate without ſinne. Therefore from that worſhip, wherein theſe Idols</hi> (viz. the ſurpluſſe, croſſe, and knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) <hi>are made and vſed, a man is bound neceſſarily to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate:</hi> The <hi>Propoſition</hi> is certaine, and by D. <hi>Ames</hi> in<note place="margin">Lib. 4, cap. 24.</note> his <hi>Caſes of conſcience</hi> acknowledged. <hi>Although</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>we may joyne to that Church, in which many defects are to be tollerated, yet not to that in which we cannot but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily partake with ſinne.</hi> The Aſſumption is aſſented unto, by as Iudicious and Zealous <hi>Nonconf.</hi> as ever held<note place="margin">Park.

               <p>D. Ames <hi>anſwereth to this effect.</hi> The confounding of mere rites with formes of worſhip is not ours, but onely by the rej. his fiction. That every Church is to be vtterly condemned, and ſo to be ſeparated from, that hath any thing in it by participation Idolatrous, is made Sciſmaticall by a Sciſmaticall conceit of the Rej. &amp;c. His profeſſion of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration (this day before he ſtept) is nothing but a Rhethoricall flouriſh which he would twice recall, before he would ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, from thoſe that bow to the Altars, or even thoſe which worſhip an vbiquitarie body in the Lords ſupper, though theſe are more palpablie Idolatrous (in his conſcience) then the Ceremonies queſtioned are in ours.</p>

or elſe (and ſo I rather thinke) he thought it beſt to let it paſſe in ſilence.

               <p>
                  <hi>The author of the Preface to his booke, ſpeaketh much like thereabout this point, a little there is added, namelie, that</hi> Chriſt (our Teacher) and his Apoſiles did
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17543:69"/>
joyne in the Iewes worſhip, vnto which were added many ſuperſtitions, as vnlawfull as their Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. I may uſe his owne words, <hi>he doth not prove that which he concludeth;</hi> For howſoever many <hi>ſuperſtitious traditions</hi> were uſed by the Iewes, yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were brought in, and added to their ſacred worſhip, inſtituted of God, as any parts therof, is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and the contrary more probable. 2. To ſay, that <hi>Christ and his Apostles did joyne in that worſhip, to which many ſuperſtitions were added,</hi> is too preſumptioeſlie ſpoken; and I wiſh men, to be more ſober, and not ſo<note place="margin">Freſh ſuit. l. 2. 321.</note> bouldlie to affirme ſuch <hi>groundleſſe poſitions,</hi> to juſtifie a corrupt and halting practiſe. I know D. <hi>Ames</hi> hath the like ſaying, that <hi>Chriſt was preſent when the traditions of men were obſerved in Gods worſhip;</hi> But he delivers this onely upon his owne word, and therefore we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it accordingly. 3. He ſaith, theſe ſuperſtitions in the Iewes worſhip, were as unlawfull as their Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. What teſtimonie brings he for it? (as before) none at all. If ſuch arguments will paſſe, a man may ſoone have enough, to fill a cart with. But note here<note place="margin">Pag. 96.</note> how greatly they contradict one another: they ſaid even now, that their Ceremonies are ſuch <hi>idolls</hi> as a man cannot lawfullie joyne with that worſhip, where they are uſed, yet here they ſay, that they are not worſe then were the <hi>ſuperſtitions in the Iews worſhip, vnto which Christ and his Apoſtles joyned;</hi> Now which ſhall a man beleeve of them? not the later, for he gives no reaſon for what he ſpeakes, but the others doe. 4. If it ſhould be all granted him (howbeit he proves nothing)
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17543:69"/>
yet it will not follow, that a man may communicate in the <hi>miniſterie, worſhip, and Eccleſ. government</hi> of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, unleſſe he can prove, that that <hi>miniſterie, worſhip, &amp; Eccleſ. government,</hi> to which Chriſt and his Apoſtles joyned, was falſe, idolatrous, Antichriſtian, as the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conconformiſts</hi> doe affirme the other to be.</p>
               <p>Some thought that this point would have beene more effectually anſwered, ſpecially becauſe D. <hi>Burg.</hi> preſſed it home ſo cloſe upon them, and tooke ſuch a ſolemne proteſtation in it, as the like is not to be ſeene (I thinke) in the booke; But for my part I exſpected no better; For I ſaw the Rei. had them at the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and therefore <hi>D. Ames</hi> was conſtrained, either to condemne their owne cheife <hi>Principles,</hi> or to juſtifie <hi>ſeparation</hi> by them, or elſe to ſhift off the point, and ſay nothing, or (as the very truth is) nothing of it to the purpoſe,</p>
               <p>Before I end this chapter; I will anſwere briefly to ſome objections, which many are ready to make for their joyning in communion with this worſhip.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>1.</hi> Howſoever we doe beleeve that the ſame is (as the Nonconformiſts ſay) unlawfull and Antichriſtian, yet we think, we may yeeld our bodily preſence to it, ſo we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly loath the ſame, &amp; keepe our hearts to God onely.</p>
               <p>Anſw. It is certaine the <hi>Prophane brood</hi> of the <hi>curſed familists,</hi> doe hold that Religion ſtandeth not in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, &amp; therefore outwardly they will ſubmitt vnto any, be the ſame never ſo falſe and vile, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that it is not the body which can ſin but the ſoule onely, the name of them, I know is generally

odious, although their principles are loved and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed too well: But that no good man may fall into this ſnare: let it be conſidered. 1. The Lord hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 19. 20.</note> ſoule and body, and by Chriſt they are both redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: therefore it is neceſſarie that we ſhould honour<note place="margin">Rivetus in Hoſ. 4. ve. 15. and 17. p. 156. 158.

If a wife ſhould proſtrate her body to the vſe of another man, ſhall ſhe be excuſed towards her huſband, by ſaying, that ſhe reſerved him moſt deare in her heart? no ſurely: If this be no reaſonable excuſe much leſſe the other. 2. It ought to be alwayes our care, ſo to live as others thereby may have cauſe to glorifie God: but this cannot be, if our viſible converſation be ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous. 3.

            <p>It is certaine that Chriſt (our heavenly Prophet) hath ſet forth vnto vs in the new Teſtament <hi>the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie forme, and manner of ordering Churches.</hi> For this ſundrie reaſons are given; 1. otherwiſe the Church<note place="margin">Proteſt. from Scot. 18.</note> (which is his bodie) ſhould be left maymed, imperfect, and voyd of ſome ſpeciall furtherances, and helpes for her edification and perfection, but this cannot be. 2. We read that vnder the <hi>Law</hi> the Lord by <hi>Moyſes,</hi> ordained a certaine forme which was not altered, nor to be altered by any King or Preiſt whatſoever: yea from the begining of the world, even from <hi>Adam</hi> to<note place="margin">Def.

Now the aſſemblies of England were not gathered by any ſuch <hi>power,</hi> but in their firſt conſtitution wanted the ſame, and had this<note place="margin">Def. Pet. for Ref. p. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>falſe power,</hi> which is exerciſed at this day, as the <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists</hi> doe aknowledge. Our Arguments which we have uſed in this point, have been to this effect.</p>
               <p>Every true viſible Church hath a power immediately vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt to execute Church Government. But the publike congregations of England have not any ſuch power vnder Christ, to execute Church Government. Therefore they are not true viſible churches.</p>
               <p>What they will ſay to this, I know not: but hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they have, either beene ſilent, or anſwered to no purpoſe in the world: For it is uſually their manner, to tell us how the Churches in <hi>Corinth, Pergamus, Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira,</hi> &amp;c. neglected to execute diſcipline, as though there were no difference betweene omitting, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the ordinance, and the want wholy of it; yea and to have an <hi>Antichriſtian &amp; Diveliſh</hi> in the roome of it. Indeed herein they well reſemble children, which being not able to read the leſſon given them, doe ſkip over, and take another eaſie one: So theſe, leave altogether the point in hand, which is to prove by Gods word, that a true Church may want in it ſelfe immediate power under Chriſt, to execute Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Government, and may be ſubject to that which was brought-in by the <hi>Romiſh Beaſt:</hi> and talke of a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I thinke no man ever denyed. It is true, ſome have aſſayed to prove it, but after many thoughts,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:17543:85"/>
ſpent about it, we have had nothing but <hi>wind</hi> from them: namely <hi>of a city wiihout a wall: of a vinyard, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Orchard</hi> &amp;c. Wanting <hi>a hedge, fence, bounds</hi> &amp;c. And ſuch broken ſtuffe, not worthy of any anſwere: For where doe they read in Scripture, that this power, which Chriſt hath given to his Church, is compared to <hi>a wall, hedge,</hi> &amp;c. But rather may be better like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to the <hi>power of the body,</hi> which receives food, and<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note> whereby excrements are purged and avoyded, the want whereof were prodigious in nature, neither could the body poſſiblie ſubſiſt and live.</p>

               <p>He might with more credit and good conſcience, have granted the <hi>Major</hi> alſo, then ſought to refute it by frothy, empty, and impertinent words: for firſt he ſpeakes as a man moſt ignorant of the nature of

And it is certainly ſo, and if <hi>M. D.</hi> have any thing to object againſt it, let him ſpeake out, he knowes his liberty. 3. If <hi>M. D.</hi> will but hold vp his words againſt the light, he ſhall ſee they have not the face of an anſwere: for let his words be graunted: what is this <hi>to the neceſsity of diſcipline,</hi> vnleſſe he could prove, that the ſame is not ſo eſſentiall but a true Church may wholy want it, The which thing, neither he nor any man is able to prove, and therefore he only beggs baſelie the matter, but proves nothing; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the <hi>warme cloathes,</hi> whereof he ſpeaketh, he may even keepe them himſelf, to cover the nakedneſſe of his Argument.</p>

               <p>I doe not gather up theſe his arguments for any need we have of them, but to put him in minde of his <hi>owne take heed:</hi> For if he ſay one thing, and doe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, he may perhaps at laſt fall worſe then <hi>vpon the quick ſands of ſeparation,</hi> even into <hi>the bottomleſſe pitt of condemnation.</hi> And whereas I perceive he is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be compared to <hi>Barrow;</hi> for my part I am not willing that he ſhould, for <hi>Reverend Barrow</hi> was true to his grounds, and walked conſcionable in <hi>the holte order</hi> of the Goſpell: to which <hi>order</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

               <p>Our third inference is, <hi>If church government be a matter of Faith, neceſſarie to ſalvation, as is any outward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, and wholie wanting in the Aſſemblies of of England, then it is the dutie of all the faithfull there, (ſhaking off the Prelates yoake) to erect this power, and exerciſe the ſame among them.</hi> I doe not mean that any private perſon ſhould meddle with the affaires of the <hi>Realme,</hi> but that every one, in his owne perſon, doe place himſelf, about the <hi>throne of God,</hi> leaving the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the publike ſtate, to be reformed, by ſuch as have a lawfull calling thereto. It is certaine, this <hi>ordinance</hi> muſt be ſett up, retained, and practiſed, though Princes are utterlie againſt it: We muſt not tarie one houre, to exſpect a new grant from men, to doe our duties in the true worſhip of God, when as we have a ſufficient grant allreadie from heaven; for if we doe, we ſhall ſurely dye in our ſinnes, and our blood ſhall be upon our owne head.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17543:90"/>
of God, and workes of religion, never a whit the more lawfull, but onely the more free from bodily daunger, ſo neither can their diſalowance make unlawfull ſuch duties of religion, as the word of God approveth, nor can they give diſpenſation to any perſon, to forbeare the practiſe thereof.</p>

Touching the manner and order of this joyning unto <hi>true viſible Churches,</hi> the Nonconformiſts doe<note place="margin">Fall of B. pa. 30. Curr.

            <p>When a people are thus eſtabliſhed, in the faith and order of the Goſpell, their care then muſt be to walk unreproovablie. and as in the naturall body, everie ſeveral member is (as it were) the member of every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in ſerving to their good, as the eie doth ſee, the<note place="margin">Cartwr.

            <p>As in all the reſt, ſo in this point the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> and we, are of judgments alike, and it is our greate greife, that they will not joyne with us in practiſe alſo, and make themſelves members of ſuch <hi>true viſible churches,</hi> as here they have well deſcribed, for ſo ſhould Gods name be glorifyed, the Goſpell propagated, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, and Antichriſts Kingdome much weakened, and themſelves obtaine mercie in the great day of the Lord.

Thus the <hi>Propoſition</hi> beeing proved, and the aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion acknowledged to be true, the concluſion muſt needs ſtand firme (viz.) <hi>that the Churches of England are not true viſible churches, rightly gathered, and planted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture;</hi> and therefore by neceſſarie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence lawfully to be ſeparated from.</p>

               <p>That Church which hath not a Lawfull miniſtery, is not a true viſible Church: But the Church of England hath not a Lawfull ministerie; Ergo the church of England is not a true<note place="margin">Babel, not Beth. pag. 108, Challeng. chap. 1, p. 33, 34,</note> viſible church.</p>
               <p>The propoſition is affirmed of the <hi>Conformists,</hi> as <hi>Burton, Sutcliffe,</hi> &amp;c. The aſſumption is granted by the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> as we have in the firſt chapter largelie ſhewed.</p>
               <p>The true viſible church of Chriſt, is a ſociety of beleeving and Faithfull people, and a communion of Saints <hi>(ſo ſay the Conformiſts)</hi> but the church of England is not a ſociety of<note place="margin">Sntcl. cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng. p. 40, &amp; anſw. to the excep. p. 65</note> beleeving and Faithfull people, a communion of Saints <hi>(thus write the Nonconform. ſee p. 169.</hi> &amp;c.) Ergo, the church of Engl. is not a true viſible church.</p>
               <p>The true church is the Kings daughter, deſcribed in Pſal. 45. But the church of England is not the Kings daughter, ſo deſcribed: Therefore the church of England is not the true<note place="margin">Burton in anſw. to H. cholm. p. 100</note> church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Propoſition is laid downe by the Conformiſts, wherby they prove <hi>Rome</hi> a falſe Church. The aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                  <hi>within the dayly voyce and call of God.</hi> 3. The later part of his reaſon, is wholie againſt himſelfe; ſor whereas his wordes import, that the people <hi>generally of England</hi> are impenitent ſinners, and unbeleevers, it muſt follow neceſſarily, that they are alltogether uncapable of any <hi>Church estate,</hi> and ſo much we have formerly proved.<note place="margin">Pag, 176<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 177.</note> Were it not a ridiculous thing, to ſet up a houſe with wood and ſtones, and afterward to take Axes, Sawes, Hammers, and other tooles, to cutt, ſaw, and fitt them for the building: yet ſuch an unskilfull builder Mr. <hi>Dayr.</hi> ſheweth himſelfe in his whole booke. For hee will have idolaters, adulterers, theeves, conjurers, murderers, and any villain in the Land, to be placed in the <hi>Lords ſpirituall houſe,</hi> and afterward will have meanes uſed to prepare them for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Not to contend about the <hi>propoſition</hi> of his ſecond ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, howbeit it is verie faulty. I denie the aſſump. viz. that <hi>the people of England doe injoy, and outwardly ſubmit themſelves to the true worſhip of God:</hi> for the <hi>worſhip</hi> which they have, is affirmed of the Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts<note place="margin">See pag. 78. &amp;c.</note> to be antichriſtian and unlawfull: but let us heare his reaſon.</p>
               <p>If ſuch as both in their life, and at theire death ſerved God with the verie ſame worſhip we doe, have in that worſhip beene ſaved, then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the worſhip wee now have, true divine worſhip. But the first is true, therefore the ſecond.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> had found ſuch a reaſon in Mr. Iohnſons writing, he would ſurely have called him <hi>idle head, crackt braind, foole</hi> &amp;c. but I leave ſuch terms to men of his intemperate ſpirit, and doe thus anſwer.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:17543:109"/>
2. <hi>A Papiſt, Arminian, or Anabaptiſt</hi> may ſay as much and upon as good ground, and who dares denie but manie of their religion, have found mercie with the Lord, muſt it therefore follow that their worſhip is good? indeed <hi>Mr. Dayr, logick</hi> ſo concludeth it. 2, Men<note place="margin">Rom. 9, 33.</note> may ſerve God with an outward worſhip, not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his word, and yet be ſaved: for who knoweth how infinitely good hee is to his poore creature. 3. It is apparent this man had a very ill caſe in hand, that could not tell how to maintaine it, but by revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſecret and hid conſell of the Lord: for I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how he came to know who in their worſhip have beene ſaved: if he ſhould ſay in the judgement of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie he thinkes thus, then his argument muſt be of an another faſhion, namely, that he thinkes their worſhip is true: for otherwiſe it will want <hi>ſhape</hi> and <hi>proportion.</hi> 4. It hath beene the conſtant practice of the godly, to proove their <hi>poſitions</hi> by the ſcriptures, but it is likely he ſaw that there was no helpe for him there, and therefore onely makes uſe of this <hi>reaſonleſſe reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His third argument is <hi>fooliſh</hi> and <hi>carnall;</hi> and both parts of it falſe. For firſt it is incident to the beſt and pureſt Churches upon earth to erre and to bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and therefore their ſentences and approbations muſt be examined by Gods word. 2. If the <hi>reformed Churches</hi> doe juſtifie the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> therein they condemne greately their owne practice: for in theire <hi>constitution, miniſtery, worſhip,</hi> and <hi>governement</hi> they are as oppoſite<note place="margin">1. Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</note> as light and darkeneſſe one to the other: and ſo much the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> confeſſe. 3. Seeing the <hi>Prophets</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:17543:109"/>
                  <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> condemne their Church, their caſe is never a whit the better, though all men in the world ſpeake well of it. 4. The ſtricteſt profeſſors, do hold the Church of England as it is <hi>Nationall, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall,</hi> and <hi>Dioceſſan,</hi> falſe: howbeit they thinke ſome particular congregations in the Land to bee true. 5. With ſuch weapons as theſe doe the <hi>Papiſts</hi> fight: and where they can bring one, the others ten, to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for them, and their <hi>Romiſh ſuperſtitions.</hi> I meane<note place="margin">Bellarm. de notis Eccleſ.</note> 
                  <hi>antiquity, univerſality</hi> and ſuch like popular reaſons, whereby they ſeeke to uphold their curſed Kingdome. Laſtly, it is untruely affirmed, that <hi>all the Churches of God in the world doe acknowledge the people of England to be a true Church.</hi> For there are many which have both profeſſed and prooved the contrary.</p>
               <p>Now for his laſt argument, I deny alſo both parts of it: and affirme that neither the <hi>mother</hi> nor <hi>daughters</hi> are true Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the reaſon which he layeth downe is, as the reſt, <hi>ſillie,</hi> and moſt <hi>impertinent</hi> to proove the thing for which he brings it. The ſumme and effect of that which hee hath written in five or ſixe pages is this, that <hi>their worſhip and religion is true,</hi> becauſe in Q. Maries dayes, divers Martyrs profeſſed the ſame, and died in it.</p>
               <p>Anſw. 1. Here the thing in queſtion is brought for confirmation: the Martyrs allowed of their worſhip, be it ſo, what then, ſhould hee not yet have prooved the ſame to be lawfull? Yes doubtleſſe, if hee would have written either according to <hi>rule, reaſon,</hi> or <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> 2. If a <hi>Papiſt</hi> ſhould ſuffer death under <hi>Heathen</hi> or

                  <hi>Turkes,</hi> becauſe he would not denie <hi>Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I deſire the Reader to marke how abſurdly he ſpeaketh: the thing which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to proove, is, that their <hi>aſſemblies are true,</hi> for this he alleageth the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> now to what purpoſe I can not tell in the world: unleſſe he meant that there was ſuch vertue and efficacy in their ſufferings, as the whole Nation thereby was ſanctified, and made Churches. Laſtly, this reaſon is one and the ſame, with that which he brought to confirme the ſecond <hi>Syllogiſme,</hi> ſave that for the more authority of it, hee addeth the name of the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>In the concluſion he ſaith,</hi> Anſwer me this one argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſo I end. If Mr. Hooper Mr. Bradford with others knowing the corruptions then in the worſhip and miniſtery, being the ſame alſo with ours now, notwithſtanding this knowledge, and not ſeparating, were ſaved: then men at this day notwithstanding their knowledge of the corruptions and not ſeparating becauſe of them, may likewiſe be ſaved. <hi>But the firſt is true: therefore the ſecond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſ. His former reaſons were not more falſe and fooliſh, than this is wicked and profane, for firſt, wherefore ſerves it, but in truth to teach men to caſt off all care in ſeeking Gods glorie, by an even walking, and to doe ſo much of his will as is ſufficient to bring them to heaven, and no more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus he counſelleth people to be <hi>lovers of themſelves</hi> more than <hi>lovers of</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:17543:110"/>
                  <hi>God:</hi> yea to love God for themſelves, and to ſerve him for a reward onely; but let all perſons, in all places take heede, that they follow not this mans ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for if they reſolve to doe no more, but what they think will ſerve their turne to be ſaved, they will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſſe of that, and for their <hi>ſelf love</hi> ſuffer wrath and vengeance eternally. 2 Howſoever Iwill not <hi>judge another mans ſervant,</hi> yet it is more then he or anie mortall man that can infalliblie tell, whether Mr. <hi>Bradford, Mr. Hooper</hi> and others were abſolutely ſaved, and therefore hee reaſoneth ſtill moſt childiſhly, to prove his matter by things ſecret, and known to God onely. 3 When <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and others left the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> might not anie <hi>popiſh prieſt</hi> have ſaid as much to them. If Mr. W. Mr. C. <hi>with others knowing the corruptions then in worſhip</hi> &amp;c. Now I perceive if <hi>Mr. Dayr.</hi> had been in their place, he would not have ſeparated from that Synagogue of Satan, and to ſpeake the verie truth, he could not do it lawfully upon his own groundes. 4. That theſe men knew ſome corruptions to be in their <hi>worſhip &amp; miniſtrie,</hi> I grant it, but not in that kinde and degree, which the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> ſince have manifeſted, for if they had certainly known that theſe things were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull and antichriſtian, and their <hi>Church government</hi> taken wholly from the <hi>Pope:</hi> I beleeve they would not have joyned in ſpirituall communion therewith, &amp; therfore <hi>Mr. Dair.</hi> ſhamfully abuſeth the reader, to ſay <hi>the martyrs ſaw their corruptions, and they are the ſame which they have now:</hi> whereas he ſhould have proved,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:17543:111"/>
that they ſaw them according to the nature of them, and as his fellow brethren have ſince ſeene them, &amp; affirmed them to be, for unleſſe this can be ſhewed, they differ herein aſmuch from the martyrs, as if one ſinned ignorantly, aud another againſt his knowledge and conſcience. 5. The ſaintes are taught of God, not to be ſervants of men, but to <hi>live by their owne faith,</hi> &amp;<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>to preſſe forward toward the mark.</hi> and therefore hee ſheweth litle ſkill in the courſe of religion, to ſette downe this, or that mans practiſe for a rule to walke by, unleſſe he had profeſſed himſelfe to be a <hi>Familiſt</hi> or <hi>perfectist,</hi> and ſo would make the world beleeve, that none could erre which took ſuch for example whom he preſcribed to them. 6. I cannot tell for what end be propounded this argument, for imagin it ſhould be granted him, that the <hi>Martyrs</hi> knew the corruptions of their Church, &amp;c. and yet were ſaved: and ſo are many now in <hi>England,</hi> which underſtand the ſame: what would hee from hence conclude? I thinke there is no man on earth that knowes; if there be, they might doe well, at the next impreſſion of his booke, to ſet it in the <hi>margin,</hi> for to cover what they can, the mans empty, naked, and abſurd writing.</p>

friend of the <hi>Separatists,</hi> yet confeſſeth the whole, as it is here laid downe to be true and good. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, this man commeth boldly forth againſt us, as if he had been either aſleepe all his life time, or lived in ſome unknowne parts of the world, and ſo could not tell what any body had ſaid about this thing.</p>
               <p>And now for his reaſons, in which he is as confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as is the ſubject for which he pleadeth: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuch as I finde here and there, diſorderly written of him, I will reduce into ſome particular heads. The maine and chiefe argument, wherewith he fighteth againſt us, for ſaying, <hi>a true viſible Church is a company of people called and ſeparated from the world.</hi> is, becauſe <hi>hypocrites and reprobates may beein the Church.</hi> And to proove this, he is very large and tedious: for I dare ſay, more then halfe of his booke is ſpent about it; in alleaging for it, Scriptures, Examples and Reaſons: But a few words will ſerve for anſwer to it; in regard he talkes of a thing, which neither helpes him, nor diſadvantageth us, for the queſtion betweene them and us, hath ever beene, about the true and naturall members, whereof Gods Church is orderly gathered, and planted: and not about the decayed and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate eſtate thereof. But of this he ſaith nothing: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reaſoneth much to this purpoſe. <hi>If a mans body may have ſores, boyles, broken limmes, &amp;c. then is not the body whole and ſound in the definition. If in a garden, vineyard, or orchard, after the conſtitution, there grow weeds, thornes, and thiſtles: then cannot the ſame in the deſcription, be ſaid to bee planted at first of all good herbes, vines and trees. But</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:17543:112"/>
                  <hi>the first is true: therefore the ſecond.</hi> Now if ſuch <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie</hi> be to be laughed at, then truely much more is M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Dayr.</hi> Divinitie here to be pittyed: for he denieth our <hi>definition,</hi> to wit, that <hi>a true viſible Church</hi> in the firſt collection conſiſteth of <hi>a people called and ſeparated from the world:</hi> and why? becauſe forſooth afterwards ſome of them may fall into unlawfull and ſinfull courſes.</p>
               <p>If all our writings ſhould bee read over, yet will it not be found, that ever we have denied; but many <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites</hi> may be in the true Church, yea open and vile tranſgreſſours: but here lyeth the poynt, if any ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the ſame may be firſt gathered, of knowne lewd, and unconverted men, that indeed wee deny utterly, and can proove the contrary: or if they ſhall ſay, that obſtinate and incorrigible ſinners, may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">See page 176. 177.</note> be ſuffered therein, this alſo we affirme to be untrue, But if they ſay, that in a true viſible Church, there may be great evils committed, yea and a long time tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wee aſſent unto it. Howbeit it is certaine (as <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Ames</hi> ſaith) <hi>this forbearance is a grieveus ſinne before God.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Dayr.</hi> therefore had well underſtood, what our negative and affirmative poſitions are, hee might have ſpared moſt of his writing. For throughout his booke, he hath moſt falſely reported of us, by inſinuating as if we held all of the viſible <hi>Church</hi> to be ſaved, and that no wickedneſſe therein can be committed: now our words tend onely to ſhew, what a Church is, and how every member ought to walke: but if in ſome reſpects they bee not ſo, yet may the Congregation notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be true and good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:17543:113"/>
Mr. Dayr tells us verie often of the ſinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Iewiſh Church,</hi> ſo in <hi>Corinth, Pergamus,</hi> &amp;c. If he were alive, I would aſke him whether they did well herein; If he ſhould ſay yea, then were he a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer; if nay, then he gave us the whole cauſe, and ſo might caſt his booke into the fyre. For the thinge which we affirm, is, that every member of the church ought to be <hi>holy,</hi> not that they are allwayes ſo, but ſhould be ſo, and it is their great fault, they are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And here the reader may obſerve how greatly he hath miſtaken the matter: For whereas Mr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ainſw.</hi> and others, doe ſhew from the ſcriptures, what a true Church is, whereof gathered, how every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhould walke, &amp; how abuſes are to be reformed, &amp;c. He (either through ignorance, or mallice, or both) ſtill inferreth from their writings: that they held <hi>perfection of Churches,</hi> that there can be no <hi>Hypocrite</hi> or <hi>reprobate</hi> in the Church, &amp;c. Things groundleſly collected of him.</p>
               <p>Of the ſame nature are the reports, which many of them publiſh dayly in their <hi>Sermons and Bookes;</hi> namely that the main cauſe of our <hi>Separation</hi> is, becauſe wicked men are ſuffered in their church. But this is untrue, for howſoever (as I ſaid before) ſuch a tolleration can not be juſtified; yet this is not properly the reaſon, but becauſe their <hi>Pariſhes</hi> were at firſt conſtituted, as now they ſtand, of the <hi>members of Antichrist,</hi> to wit, the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Papiſts, and of all other kind of moſt notorious ſinners, as whorems. witches, atheiſts, ſwearers, uſurers, curſers, ſcoffers at religion, &amp;c.

Obſerve how the exception which he makes here againſt us, ſerves nothing to helpe his caſe; for if all the perſons which he names, were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the viſible Church, and ſay it was by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes, beſide the word, that mooved their hearts to obey the Lord therein; yet how can he proove, that theſe were <hi>outwardly wicked,</hi> and <hi>irreligious,</hi> knowne to be Idolaters, drunkards, ſorcerers, mockers, lyers, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, &amp;c.

                  <hi>Churches by the</hi> ſword, <hi>about this he begins with a tedious compariſon of one that hath</hi> children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants which be papiſts, and by threats will have them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God aright, thereupon they frequent the Church aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies and ſeeme outwardly to be religious, and are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted

of the viſible church, and yet theſe came not to be of the Church by the call of the word &amp;c. now may the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and father doe this, and may not the magiſtrate? &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Anſ. 1. Howſoever parents and maſters, are to uſe all good means, that thoſe which are under their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be religious &amp; holy, yet have they not anie more power to make them members of Gods Church (if they be not under the viſible covenant) then they have power to give them ſaving grace, &amp; ſanctification. 2. Whereas he ſaith, theſe come not to be of the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church,</hi> by the <hi>call of the word,</hi> that is untrue; For howſoever a perſon may come, to the place where a Church is; yet his comming ſimplie there, doth not immediately make him an actuall member of it, as he ſtill ignorantly intimates; For thoſe of his brethren, which were farre more judicious then himſelfe, doe<note place="margin">T. c. l. 1, Pag. 51.</note> teach otherwiſe: <hi>when men doe profitt in hearing, then are they to be joyned to the Church.</hi> But it ſeemes if <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then &amp; Turkes,</hi> would have but come to his <hi>ſervice</hi> and <hi>preaching,</hi> he would have acknowledged them to be part of his flock, albeit they manifeſted no repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance at all; If he ſhould ſay, no, then were he contrarie to his owne ſaying here. 3. This Similitude is againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; For firſt, the Magiſtrate did not commaund the Subjects, to goe unto Churches, formerly gathered, and there to be prepared by hearing. but forded them to be members; they beeing altogether and every way moſt unfitt. 2. The worſhip which they did, was not according to Gods word, but after the traditions and deviſes of men. 3. They neither outwardly ſeemed

Although in the courſe of his life, he made ſhew to be a great eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the <hi>Bb.</hi> and their <hi>traditions;</hi> yet now againſt us, he ſtandeth to maintaine the vileſt abominations in their Churches. 4. Such corruptions as the <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists</hi> generally have condemned, he baſely here ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth; and by the ſame carnall and corrupt reaſons, which the <hi>Prelates</hi> uſe to doe, ſo that his writing is not more againſt us, then againſt themſelves, and therefore it concerneth them as much as us, to ſet forth an anſwer unto it. 5.

When we know what thoſe <hi>acceſſarie parts</hi> bee, which <hi>true Paſtors, and teachers</hi> may have of their <hi>offices, callings, and adminiſtrations, not ordained by Chriſt,</hi> we will ſpeak more of that point, in the meane time, they may doe well, to conſider, that they want not the <hi>acceſſarie</hi> only, but indeed the <hi>ſubſtanciall and eſſenciall parts of true offices,</hi> &amp;c. &amp; this they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelvs doe not barely ſay, but ſoundly prove: &amp; to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fute this, Mr. <hi>Bradſh.</hi> hath nothing in all his writing, and therefore their owne arguments muſt needs ſtand in force, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they doe revoke them, and bring better to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether the <hi>Prelates</hi> be ordinarie, or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie miniſters, it is not material, and therefore the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is idle, and impertinent; For if their <hi>office and</hi>

            <p>In page 46. he ſayth, that <hi>the Prelates may well laugh at Mr. Iohnſons ſimplicity and ſillineſſe of wit, that thinkes to fright them with ſuch a bugbeare as this,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p n="3">3.

The truth is, his arguing is no better, then if <hi>Ieroboams Preiſts</hi> ſhould thus have pleaded: Thoſe Preiſts, that teach Iacob<note place="margin">Deu. 33, 10</note> Gods judgements, and Iſrael his Law, that put incenſe before the face of God, and burne incenſe upon his Altar, are true Preiſts; But theſe things doe we, therfore we are true Preiſts.

            <p n="4">4. Howſoever, he often undertakes, the defence of all their miniſters, yet here he leaves the blinde Preiſts in the ditch: And indeed this is the manner uſually of them, they are ſo ſhifting up &amp; downe, as a man knows not where there <hi>home</hi> is, nor when to find them there, for ſome time the <hi>whole Clergie</hi> is pleaded for: when they are beaten thence, then they fly to <hi>their beſt mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;</hi> when they cannot defend them any longer, then we have an howers talke of their <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>ſervices.</hi>

Thus as a man that ſitteth uneaſie, is ever ſtirring to &amp; fro, till he be out of his place, ſo doe they ſhift, and ſhift, till they be cleane out of their arguments &amp; matter: If they thinke, I ſpeake beyond my compaſſe, let them once pitch and inſiſt upon any one of theſe grounds, without ſtarting, joyne iſſue with us, and come to the particular, that ſo a directly named poſition, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a direct and ſpeciall reply.</p>

Firſt, he endureth the kneeler by his preſence, and maketh him thinke, that his kneeling is neither ſcandalous nor idolatrous. You ſay, your ſitting condemneth his kneeling. No ſuch matter. But in communicating with him, you approve it as indifferent, as when ye ſit in time of prayer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sermon, When another is kneeling, or standing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For ſhall you communicate With an idolater in the very

And howbeit, there may be ſome difference betwixt the Formalists, and the Papiſts, ariſing upon the diverſitie of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward opinions and conceits of Chriſts reall preſence in the Elements, yet if both their gestures be idolatrous in their<note place="margin">Auguſt. hom. de Paſtor.</note> owne kindes, the Lords Supper is made an idoll feast. <hi>Non ad diabolum pertinet quis iſto, vel illo modo erret, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes errantes vult quibuſlibet erroribus.</hi> It is nothing to the Devill, whether a man erre this way, or that way what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever way they erre, all that be in errour, he ſeeketh to be his.

               <hi>Howſoever. I will not contend much with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the</hi> Propoſition, <hi>which is lame to the ground; and a farre better might have beene framed breifly thus:</hi> To have ſuch an office, as Christ in his Testament hath given to his Church; a lawfull calling and enterance therevnto, and a lawfull administration thereof, according to the ſaid Teſtament, are all the eſſencial, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Aſſumption is falſe. 1. Their miniſters have not the <hi>gifts,</hi> whereof he ſpeaketh, and ſo we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted from their owne writings. 2.

Another reaſon, which he brings, to prove their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery Lawfull, is, becauſe <hi>they profeſſe the Pope to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt; renounce all Eccleſiaſtical homage to him, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine all the members of the Church of Rome to be Hereticks and Idolaters.</hi> &amp;c.
