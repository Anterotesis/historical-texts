            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:102693:3"/>
                     <hi>might have begot a boldness in some Men of as mean as my mean Abilities to have undertaken this. But indeed,</hi> my Lord, <hi>though I was ambitious enough of undertaking it; yet, as</hi> Sir Henry Wotton <hi>hath said in a Piece of his own Character,</hi> That he was condemn'd by Nature to a bashfulness in making Requests: <hi>so I find my self</hi> (pardon the Parallel) <hi>so like him in this, that if I had not had more Reasons then I have yet exprest, these alone had not been powerful enough to have created a Confidence in me to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it. Two of my unexprest Reasons are,</hi> (give me leave to tell them to Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and the World) <hi>that</hi> Sir Henry Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, <hi>whose many Merits made him an Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment even to Your Family, was yet so humble, as to acknowledge me to be his Friend; and died in a belief that I was so: since which time, I have made him the best return of my Gratitude for his Condescention, that I have</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>My other Reason of this boldness, is, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement</hi> (very like a command) <hi>from Your worthy Cousin, and my Friend,</hi> Mr. Charles Cotton, <hi>who hath assared me, that You are such a Lover of the Memory of Your Generous Unkle,</hi> Sir Henry Wotton, <hi>that if there were no other Reason then my endeavors to preserve it, yet, that that alone would secure this Dedication from being unacceptable.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> (whose Life I novv intend to vvrite) vvas born in the Year of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption 1568. in <hi>Bocton-hall,</hi> (commonly called <hi>Bocton,</hi> or <hi>Bougton</hi> - place, or Palace) in the Parish of <hi>Bocton Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herb,</hi> in the fruitful Country of <hi>Kent: Bocton-hall</hi> being an <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>goodly Structure,</hi> beautifying, and being beautified by the Parish Church of <hi>Bocton Malherb</hi> adjoyning unto it; and both seated vvithin a fair Park of the <hi>Wottons,</hi> on the Brovv of such a <hi>Hill,</hi> as gives the advantage of a large Prospect, and of equal <hi>pleasure</hi> to all Beholders.</p>
                  <p>But this House and Church are not remarkable for any thing so much, as for that the memorable Family of the <hi>Wottons</hi> have so long inhabited the one, and novv lie buried in the other, as appears by their many <hi>Monuments</hi> in that Church: the <hi>Wottons</hi> being a Family that hath brought forth divers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons eminent for Wisdom and Valour; vvhose Heroick Acts, and Noble Employments, both in
<pb facs="tcp:102693:7"/>
                     <hi>England</hi> and in Foreign parts, have adorned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and this Nation; which they have served abroad faithfully, in the discharge of their great trust, and prudently in their Negotiations with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Princes; and also served at home with much Honour and Justice, in their wise managing a great part of the Publick Affairs thereof, in the various times both of War and Peace.</p>
                  <p>But, lest I should be thought by any that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline either to deny or doubt this Truth, not to have observed <hi>moderation</hi> in the commendation of this Family: and also, for that I believe the <hi>merits</hi> and <hi>memory</hi> of such Persons ought to be thankfully recorded, I shall offer to the consideration of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reader, out of the testimony of their <hi>Pedegree,</hi> and our <hi>Chronicles,</hi> a part (and but a part) of that just Commendation which might be from thence enlarged, and shall then leave the indifferent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to judge, whether my error be an <hi>excess</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> of Commendations.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Robert Wotton</hi> of <hi>Bocton Malherb</hi> Knight, vvas born about the Year of Christ 1460: he living in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, vvas by him trusted to be Lieutenant of <hi>Guisnes,</hi> to be Knight Porter, and Comptroller of <hi>Callais,</hi> where he died, and lies honourably buried.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edward Wotton</hi> of <hi>Bocton Malherb</hi> Knight, (Son and Heir of the said Sir <hi>Robert)</hi> was born in the Year of Christ 1489, in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh: he was made Treasurer of <hi>Callais,</hi> and of the Privy Councel to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, who offered him to be Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of <hi>England;</hi> but (saith <note n="*" place="margin">In his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle.</note> 
                     <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linshed)</hi> out of a virtuous modesty he refused it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:102693:7"/>
                     <hi>Thomas Wotton</hi> of <hi>Bocton Malherb</hi> Esquire, Son and Heir of the said Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> (and the Father of our Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> that occasions this Relation) was born in the Year of Christ 1521: he was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man excellently educated, and studious in all the <hi>Liberal Arts,</hi> in the knowledge whereof, he attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto a great perfection; who, though he had (besides those abilities, a very Noble and plentiful Estate, and the ancient Interest of his <hi>Predecessors)</hi> many invitations from Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to change his Country Recreations and Retirement for a Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering him a Knight-hood, (she vvas then vvith him at his <hi>Boctonhall)</hi> and that to be but as an earnest of some more honourable and more profitable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment under Her; yet he humbly refused both, being <hi>a man of great modesty,</hi> of a most <hi>plain and single heart,</hi> of <hi>an ancient freedom, and integrity of mind.</hi> A commendation which Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion often to remember with great gladness, and thankfully to boast himself the Son of such a Father: From whom indeed he derived that noble ingenuity that was always practised by himself, and which he ever both commended and cherished in others. This <hi>Thomas</hi> was also remarkable for Hospitality, a great Lover, and much beloved of his Country; to which may justly be added, that he was a Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risher of <hi>Learning,</hi> as appears by that excellent An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary Mr. <hi>William Lambert,</hi> in his Perambulation of <hi>Kent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Thomas</hi> had four Sons, Sir <hi>Edward,</hi> Sir <hi>James,</hi> Sir <hi>John,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Edward</hi> was Knighted by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and made Comptroller of Her Majesties Houshold. He was (saith <hi>Cambden)</hi> a man remarkable for many and great Employments in the State, during Her
<pb facs="tcp:102693:8"/>
Reign, and sent several times <hi>Ambassador</hi> into Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations. After Her death, he was by King <hi>James</hi> made Comptroller of his Houshold, and called to be of His Privy Councel, and by him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to be <hi>Lord Wotton, Baron</hi> of <hi>Merley</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and made Lord Lieutenant of that County.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>James</hi> (the second Son) may be numbred among the Martial Men of his Age, who was in the 38 of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign (with <hi>Robert Earl</hi> of <hi>Sussex, Count Lodowick</hi> of <hi>Nassaw, Don Christophoro,</hi> Son of <hi>Antonio</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and divers other Gentlemen of Nobleness and Valour) Knighted in the Field near <hi>Cadiz</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> after they had gotten great Honour and Riches, besides a notable retaliation of Injuries by taking that Town.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>John,</hi> being a Gentleman excellently accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, both by Learning and Travel, was Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and by Her look'd upon with more then ordinary favour, and with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of preferment; but Death in his younger years put a period to his growing hopes.</p>
                  <p>Of Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> my following discourse shall give an account.</p>
                  <p>The descent of these fore-named <hi>Wottons</hi> were all in a direct Line; and most of them and their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the memory of those with whom we have conversed: But if I had looked so far back as to Sir <hi>Nicholas Wotton,</hi> (who lived in the Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second) or before him, upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others of great note in their several Ages, I might by some be thought tedious; and yet others may more justly think me negligent, if I omit to mention <hi>Nicholas Wotton,</hi> the fourth Son of Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> whom I first named.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Nicholas Wotton was Doctor of Law,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<pb facs="tcp:102693:8"/>
                     <hi>Dean</hi> both of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Canterbury:</hi> a man vvhom God did not only bless vvith a long life, but vvith great abilities of mind, and an inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to imploy them in the service of his Countrey, as is testified by his severall Imployments; <note n="*" place="margin">Cambden <hi>in his</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannia.</note> having been sent nine times <hi>Ambassador</hi> unto forraign Princes; and by his being a Privy-<hi>Councellor</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, to <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, to Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth;</hi> vvho also, after he had been during the Wars between <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> three several times (and not unsuccessfully) imployed in Committies for setling of peace betwixt this and those Kingdomes, died (saith learned <hi>Cambden) full of Commendations for Wisdome and Piety.</hi>—He vvas also by the Will of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, made one of his Executors, and chief <hi>Secretary</hi> of State to his Son, that plous Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth.—Concerning which <hi>Nicholas Wotton,</hi> I shall say but this little more; That he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused (being offered it by Queen <hi>Elizabeth)</hi> to be <note n="*" place="margin">Hollinshed.</note> 
                     <hi>Arch bishop</hi> of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> and that he died not rich, though he lived in that time of the dissolution of <hi>Abbeys.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>More might be added: but by this it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> vvas a Branch of such a kindred as left a Stock of Reputation to their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity; such Reputation, as might kindle a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous emulation in strangers, and preserve a noble ambition in those of his Name and Family, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Actions vvorthy of their Ancestors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And, that Sir</hi> Henry Wotton <hi>did so, might appear more perfectly then my Pen can express it, if of his many surviving friends, some one of higher parts and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>

                     <hi>had been pleased to have commended his to Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; But, since some years are now past, and they have all (I know not why) forborn to do it; my gratitude to the memory of my dead friend, and the renewed request of some</hi>

                  <p>This being premised, I proceed to tell the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the Father of Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> vvas twice married, first to <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Daughter of Sir <hi>John Rudstone</hi> Knight; after vvhose death, though his inclination vvas averse to all Contentions; yet, necessitated he vvas to several Suits in Law: in the prosecution vvhereof, (vvhich took up much of his time, and vvere the occasion of many Discontents) he vvas by divers of his friends ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly perswaded to a <hi>re-marriage;</hi> to vvhom he as often answered, That if ever he did put on a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to marry, <hi>he was seriously resolved to avoid three sorts of persons:</hi>

                  <p>By her (vvho vvas the Daughter of Sir <hi>William Finch</hi> of <hi>Eastwell</hi> in <hi>Kent)</hi> he had only <hi>Henry</hi> his youngest Son.—His Mother undertook to be Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toress unto him during much of his Childhood; for vvhose care and pains, he paid her each day vvith such visible signs of future perfection in Learning, as turned her imployment into a pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-trouble: vvhich she vvas content to continue, till his Father took him into his own particular care, and disposed of him to a Tutor in his own House at <hi>Bocton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, vvhen time and diligent instruction, had made him fit for a removal to an higher Form, (vvhich vvas very early) he vvas sent to <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-School:</hi> a place of strict Discipline and Order: that so, he might in his youth be moulded into a Method of living by Rule, vvhich his vvise Father knew to be the most necessary vvay, to make the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture part of his life, both happy to himself, and usefull for the discharge of all business, vvhether publick or private.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:102693:10"/>
And, that he might be confirmed in this <hi>regulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> he was at a fit age removed from that <hi>School,</hi> to be a Commoner of <hi>New-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford;</hi> both being founded by <hi>William Wickham</hi> Bishop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There he continued, till about the eighteenth year of his Age: and was then transplanted into <hi>Queens-Colledge;</hi> where within that year, he was by the chief of that Colledge, perswasively injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to write a Play for their private use: (it was the Tragedy of <hi>Tancredo)</hi> which was so interwoven with Sentences, and for the Method and exact per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonating those humours, passions, and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he proposed to represent, so perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the gravest of that society declared, he had in a sleight imployment, given an early, and a solid testimony of his future abilities. And, though there may be some sowr dispositions, which may think this not worth a <hi>memorial;</hi> yet, that wise Knight <hi>Baptista G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>But I pass to what will be thought more serious.</p>
                  <p>About the twentieth year of his Age, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Master of <hi>Arts;</hi> and at that time read in Latine three Lectures <hi>de Oculo:</hi> wherein, he having described the <hi>Form,</hi> the <hi>Motion,</hi> the curious <hi>compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> of the <hi>Eye:</hi> and, demonstrated, how of those very many, every <hi>humour</hi> and <hi>nerve</hi> performs its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Office, so as the God of Order hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without mixture or confusion; and all this, to the advantage of man, to whom the <hi>Eye</hi> is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, not only as the Bodies guide, but, whereas all other of his senses require time to inform the
<pb facs="tcp:102693:10"/>
Soul, this, in an instant apprehends and warns him of <hi>danger:</hi> teaching him in the very <hi>eyes</hi> of others to discover <hi>wit, folly, love,</hi> and <hi>hatred:</hi> After he had made these Observations he fell to dispute this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Question, <hi>Whether we see by the Emission of the Beams from within, or Reception of the Species from without?</hi> and, after that, and many other like learned disquisitions, he in the Conclusion of his <hi>Lectures,</hi> took a fair occasion to beautifie his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with a Commendation of the blessing and benefit of <hi>Seeing: By which, we do not only discover</hi> Natures Secrets: <hi>but, with a continued content (for the eye is never weary of seeing) behold the great</hi> Light <hi>of the</hi> World, <hi>and by it, discover the Fabrick of the</hi> Heavens, <hi>and both the Order and Motion of the</hi> Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial Orbs; <hi>nay, that if the</hi> eye <hi>look but downward, it may rejoyce to behold the bosome of the</hi> Earth, <hi>our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Mother,</hi> embroidered <hi>and</hi> adorned <hi>with number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and various</hi> Flowers, <hi>which man sees daily grow up to perfection, and then, silently moralize his own conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who in a short time (like those very</hi> Flowers) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes, withers, <hi>and quickly returns again to that</hi> Earth, <hi>from which both had their first being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These were so exactly debated, and so Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally heightned, as, among other admirers, caused that learned <hi>Italian, Albericus Gentilis</hi> (then Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor of the <hi>Civil Law</hi> in <hi>Oxford)</hi> to call him <hi>Henrice mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>celle;</hi> which dear expression of his, was also used by divers of Sir <hi>Henry</hi>'s dearest Friends, and by many other persons of Note, during his stay in the University.</p>
                  <p>But his stay there was not long; at least, not so long as his Friends once intended: for, the year after Sir <hi>Henry</hi> proceeded Master of Arts, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (whom Sir <hi>Henry</hi> did never mention without
<pb facs="tcp:102693:11"/>
this, or some like reverential expression; as, <hi>That good man my Father;</hi> or, <hi>My Father the best of men:)</hi> about that time, this good man changed this for a better life; leaving to Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> as to his other younger Sons, a Rent charge of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Mark a year, to be paid for ever, out of some one of his Mannors of a much greater value.</p>
                  <p>And here, though this good man be dead, yet I wish a Circumstance or two that concern him, may not be buried without a Relation; which I shall undertake to do, for that I suppose, they may so much concern the Reader to know, that I may promise my self a pardon for a short Digression.</p>
                  <p>IN the year of our Redemption, 1553. <hi>Nicholas Wotton</hi> Dean of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (whom I formerly mentioned) being then Ambassador in <hi>France,</hi> dream'd, that his Nephew, this <hi>Thomas Wotton,</hi> was inclined to be a party in such a project, as, if he were not suddenly prevented, would turn both to the loss of his life, and ruine of his <hi>Family.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doubtless, the good Dean did well know, that common Dreams are but a senseless paraphrase on our waking thoughts; or, of the business of the day past; or, are the result of our over engaged affections, when we betake our selves to rest; and knew that the observation of them, may turn to sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Superstitions; as they too often do: But, though he might know all this, and, might also believe that Prophesies are ceased; yet, doubtless he could not but consider, that all Dreams are not to be neglected or cast away without all considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and did therefore rather lay this Dream aside, then intend totally to lose it; and dreaming the same again the Night following, when it became a
<pb facs="tcp:102693:11"/>
double Dream, like that of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (of which double dreams, the learned have made many obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations) and considering that it had no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on his vvaking thoughts, much less on the desires of his heart, then, he did more seriously consider it; and, remembred that Almighty God vvas pleased in a Dream to reveal and to assure <note n="*" place="margin">St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s Confession.</note> 
                     <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica</hi> the Mother of St. <hi>Austin, that he, her Son for whom she wept so bitterly, and prayed so much should at last become a Christian:</hi> This I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the good Dean considered; and, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also, that Almighty God (though the causes of Dreams be often unknown) hath even in these latter times also, by a certain <hi>illumination</hi> of the Soul in sleep, discovered many things that humane vvisdome could not foresee: Upon these conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, he resolved to use so prudent a remedy by vvay of prevention, as might introduce no great inconvenience either to himself or to his Nephew. And to that end, he vvrote to the <hi>Queen</hi> ('twas Queen <hi>Mary)</hi> and besought her, <hi>That she would cause his Nephew</hi> Thomas Wotton, <hi>to be sent for out of</hi> Kent: <hi>and, that the Lords of her Council might interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate him in some such feigned Questions, as might give a colour for his Commitment into a favourable</hi> Prison; <hi>declaring, that he would acquaint her Majesty with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>'Twas done as the <hi>Dean</hi> desired: and in Prison I must leave Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> till I have told the Reader vvhat followed.</p>
                  <p>At this time a Marriage vvas concluded betwixt our <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> and <hi>Philip King</hi> of <hi>Spain:</hi> And though this vvas concluded vvith the advice, if not
<pb facs="tcp:102693:12"/>
by the perswasion of her Privy Council, as having many probabilities of advantage to this Nation: yet, divers persons of a contrary perswasion, did not only declare against it, but also raised Forces to oppose it; believing (as they said) it would be a means to bring <hi>England</hi> to be under a subjection to <hi>Spain,</hi> and make those of this Nation slaves to <hi>Strangers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And of this number Sir <hi>Thomas Wyat</hi> of <hi>Boxley-Abbey</hi> in <hi>Kent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> (betwixt whose Family, and the Family of the <hi>Wottons,</hi> there had been an ancient and entire friendship) was the principal Actor; who having perswaded many of the Nobility and Gentry (especially of <hi>Kent)</hi> to side with him, and he being defeated, and taken Prisoner, was legally arraigned and condemned, and lost his life: So did the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and divers others, especially many of the Gentry of <hi>Kent,</hi> who were there in several places executed as <hi>Wyat</hi>'s assistants.</p>
                  <p>And of this number, in all probability, had Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> been if he had not been confin'd: for, though he could not be ignorant that <hi>another mans Treason, makes it mine by concealing it;</hi> yet, he durst confess to his Uncle, when he returned into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and then came to visit him in Prison, <hi>that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ad more then an intimation of</hi> Wyat's <hi>intentions;</hi> and, thought he had not continued actually <hi>innocent,</hi> if his Uncle had not so happily dream'd him into a <hi>Prison;</hi> out of which place, when he was delivered by the same hand that caused his Commitment, they both considered the Dream more seriously; and then, both joyned in praising God for it; <hi rend="margQuotes">That God, who tyes himself to no Rules, either in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of evil, or in shewing of mercy to those, whom of good pleasure he hath chosen to love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:102693:12"/>
And this Dream was the more considerable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that God who in the dayes of old did use to speak to his people in visions, did seem to speak to many of this Family in dreams: of which I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so give the Reader one short particular of this <hi>Thomas Wotton,</hi> whose dreams did usually prove true, both in foretelling things to come, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering things past: And, the particular is this; <hi rend="margQuotes">This <hi>Thomas,</hi> a little before his death, dream'd that the <hi>University Treasury</hi> was robbed by <hi>Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and poor <hi>Scholars;</hi> and, that the number was five:</hi> And being that day to write to his Son <hi>Henry</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> he thought it worth so much pains, as by a Postscript in his Letter, to make a slight enquiry of it; the Letter (which was writ out of <hi>Kent,</hi> and dated three dayes before) came to his Sons hands the very morning after the night in which the Robbery was committed; and when the City and University were both in a perplext Enquest of the Thieves, then did Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> shew his Fathers Letter, and by it such <hi>light</hi> was given of this work of <hi>darkness,</hi> that the five guilty persons were presently discovered, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, without putting the <hi>University</hi> to so much trouble, as the casting of a <hi>Figure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it may yet be more considerable, that this <hi>Nicholas</hi> and <hi>Thomas Wotton</hi> should both (being men of holy lives, of even tempers, and much given to fasting and prayer) foresee and foretell the very dayes of their own death: <hi>Nicholas</hi> did so, being then Seventy years of age, and in perfect health. <hi>Thomas</hi> did the like in the sixty fifth year of his age; who being then in <hi>London</hi> (where he dyed.) and foreseeing his death there, gave direction in what manner his Body should be carried to <hi>Bocton;</hi> and,
<pb facs="tcp:102693:13"/>
though he thought his Uncle <hi>Nicholas</hi> worthy of that noble Monument which he built for him in the <hi>Cathedral Church</hi> of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> yet this humble man gave direction concerning himself, to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried privately, and especially without any pomp at his Funeral. This is some account of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which seemed to be beloved of God.</p>
                  <p>BUt it may now seem more then time that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> at <hi>Oxford;</hi> vvhere, after his optick Lecture, he vvas taken into such a bosome friendship vvith the Learned <hi>Albericus Gentilis</hi> (vvhom I formerly named) that if it had been possible, <hi>Gentilis</hi> vvould have breathed all his excellent knowledge, both of the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> into the breast of his dear <hi>Harry</hi> (for so <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilis</hi> used to call him:) and though he vvas not able to do that, yet there vvas in Sir <hi>Henry</hi> such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensity and connaturalness to the <hi>Italian</hi> Language, and those Studies vvhereof <hi>Gentilis</hi> vvas a great Master, that this friendship between them did dayly increase, and proved dayly advantagious to Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> for the improvement of him in several Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, during his stay in the University.</p>
                  <p>From vvhich place, before I shall invite the Reader to follovv him into a foreign Nation, though I must omit to mention divers Persons that vvere then in <hi>Oxford,</hi> of memorable note for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Friends to Sir <hi>Henry Wotton;</hi> yet I must not omit the mention of a love that vvas there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun betwixt him and Dr. <hi>Donne</hi> (sometimes Dean of St. <hi>Pauls)</hi> a man of vvhose abilities I shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to say any thing, because he vvho is of this <hi>Nation,</hi> and pretends to Learning or Ingenuity, and is ignorant of Dr. <hi>Donne,</hi> deserves not to knovv
<pb facs="tcp:102693:13"/>
him. The friendship of these two I must not omit to mention, being such a friendship as vvas gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously elemented: And as it vvas begun in their Youth, and in an University, and there maintained by correspondent Inclinations and Studies, so it lasted till Age and Death forced a Separation.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Oxford</hi> he stayed till about two years after his Fathers death; at vvhich time, he vvas about the two and twentieth year of his Age: and having to his great Wit added the ballast of Learning, and knowledge of the Arts, he then laid aside his Books, and betook himself to the useful Library of Travel, and a more general Conversation vvith Mankind; employing the remaining part of his Youth, his industry and fortune to adorn his mind, and to purchase the rich Treasure of Foreign knowledge; of vvhich, both for the secrets of Nature, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of many Nations, their several Laws and Languages, he vvas the possessor in a very large measure; as I shall faithfully make to appear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I take my Pen from the following Narration of his Life.</p>
                  <p>In his Travels, vvhich vvas almost nine years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his return into <hi>England,</hi> he stayed but one year in <hi>France,</hi> and most of that in <hi>Geneva;</hi> vvhere he became acquainted vvith <hi>Theodor Beza</hi> (then very aged) and vvith <hi>Isaac Causabon,</hi> in vvhose house (if I be rightly informed) Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> vvas lodged, and there contracted a most worthy friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship vvith that man of rare Learning and Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity.</p>
                  <p>Three of the remaining eight years vvere spent in <hi>Germany,</hi> the other five in <hi>Italy,</hi> (the Stage on vvhich God appointed he should act a great part of his life) where both in <hi>Rome, Venice</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> he
<pb facs="tcp:102693:14"/>
became acquainted vvith the most eminent men for Learning, and all manner of Arts; as <hi>Picture, Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, Chymistry, Architecture,</hi> and other manual Arts, even Arts of inferiour nature; of all which, he was a most dear Lover, and a most excellent Judge.</p>
                  <p>He returned out of <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>England</hi> about the thirtieth year of his age, being then noted by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, both for his person and comportment; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he vvas of a choice shape, tall of stature, and of a most perswasive behaviour; vvhich vvas so mixed vvith sweet Discourse, and Civilities, as gained him much love from all Persons vvith whom he entred into an acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>And vvhereas he vvas noted in his Youth to have a sharp Wit, and apt to jest; that, by Time, Travel, and Conversation, vvas so polish'd, and made so useful, that his company seemed to be one of the delights of mankind; insomuch as <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> (then one of the Darlings of Fortune, and in greatest favour vvith Queen <hi>Elizabeth)</hi> invited him first into a friendship, and after a knowledge of his great abilities, to be one of his Secretaries; the other being Mr. <hi>Henry Cuffe,</hi> sometimes of <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxford</hi> (and there also the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> in his Youth) Mr. <hi>Cuffe</hi> being then a man of no common note in the University for his Learning; nor after his remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val from that place, for the great abilities of his mind; nor indeed, for the <hi>fatalness</hi> of his end.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> being now taken into a service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able friendship with the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> did perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally attend his Counsels and Employments in two Voyages at Sea against the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and also in that (which was the Earls last) into <hi>Ireland;</hi> that Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age wherein he then did so much provoke the Queen
<pb facs="tcp:102693:14"/>
to anger, and worse at his return into <hi>England;</hi> upon whose immovable favour the Earl had built such sandy hopes, as incouraged him to those under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, which with the help of a contrary Faction suddenly caused his Commitment to the Tower.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> observing this, though he was not of that Faction (for the <hi>Earls</hi> Followers were also divided into their several interests) which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the <hi>Earl</hi> to those undertakings vvhich proved so fatal to him, and divers of his Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: yet, knowing <hi>Treason</hi> to be so compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive, as to take in even Circumstances, and out of them to make such positive Conclusions as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle States-men shall project, either for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge or safety; considering this, he thought prevention by absence out of <hi>England,</hi> a better security then to stay in it, and there plead his innocency in a <hi>Prison.</hi> Therefore did he, so soon as the Earl was apprehended, very quickly, and as privately glide through <hi>Kent</hi> to <hi>Dover,</hi> without so much as looking toward his native and beloved <hi>Bocton;</hi> and was by the help of favourable winds, and liberal payment of the Mariners, within six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hours after his departure from <hi>London,</hi> set upon the <hi>French</hi> shore; where he heard shortly after, that the <hi>Earl</hi> was Arraign'd, Condemned, and Beheaded; and that his Friend Mr. <hi>Cuffe</hi> was hang'd, and divers other Persons of Eminent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity executed.</p>
                  <p>The Times did not look so favourably upon Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> as to invite his return into <hi>England;</hi> having therefore procured of Sir <hi>Edward Wotton,</hi> his elder Brother, an assurance that his Annuity should be paid him in <hi>Italy,</hi> thither he went, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily renewing his intermitted friendship and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
<pb facs="tcp:102693:15"/>
and indeed, his great content in a new conversation with his old Acquaintance in that Nation; and more particularly in <hi>Florence,</hi> (which City is not more eminent for the Great Dukes Court, then for the great recourse of men of choicest note for Learning and Arts;) in which number he there met with his old Friend Signior <hi>Vietta,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Venice,</hi> and then taken to be <hi>Secretary</hi> to the Great Duke of <hi>Tuscany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After some stay in <hi>Florence,</hi> he went the fourth time to visit <hi>Rome,</hi> where in the <hi>English Colledge</hi> he had very many Friends (their humanity made them really so, though they knew him to be a dissenter from many of their Principles of Religion;) and having enjoyed their company, and satisfied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self concerning some Curiosities that did partly occasion his Journey thither, he returned back to <hi>Florence,</hi> where a most notable accident befel him; an accident that did not only find new employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his choice Abilities, but introduce him a knowledg and an interest with our King <hi>Iames,</hi> then King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> which I shall proceed to relate.</p>
                  <p>But first, I am to tell the Reader, That though Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (or she and her Council) were never willing to declare her <hi>Successor;</hi> yet <hi>Iames</hi> then King of the <hi>Scots,</hi> was confidently believed by most to be the man upon whom the sweet trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Kingly Government would be imposed; and the <hi>Queen</hi> declining very fast, both by age and visible infirmities, those that were of the <hi>Romish</hi> perswasion in point of Religion (even <hi>Rome</hi> it self, and those of this Nation) knowing that the death of the <hi>Queen,</hi> and the establishing of her <hi>Successor,</hi> were taken to be <hi>critical</hi> days for destroying or establishing the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion in this Nation,
<pb facs="tcp:102693:15"/>
did therefore improve all opportunities for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting a Protestant Prince to succeed Her. And as the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Excommunication of <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> had both by the judgement and practice of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suited Papist, exposed her to be warrantably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed; so (if we may believe an angry Adversary, a <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Watson</hi> in his Quodlibets.</note> 
                     <hi>secular Priest</hi> against a <hi>Iesuit)</hi> you may believe, that about that time there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny indeavours, first to excommunicate, and then to shorten the life of King <hi>Iames.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Immediately after Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi>'s return from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Florence,</hi> (which was about a year before the death of Queen <hi>Elizabeth) Ferdinand</hi> the Great Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> had intercepted certain Letters that discovered a design to take away the life of <hi>Iames</hi> the then King of <hi>Scots.</hi> The Duke abhorring the Fact, and resolving to indeavor a prevention of it, advised with his Secretary <hi>Vietta,</hi> by what means a caution might be best given to that King; and after consideration, it was resolved to be done by Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> whom <hi>Vietta</hi> first commended to the <hi>Duke;</hi> and the <hi>Duke</hi> had noted and approved of above all the <hi>English</hi> that frequented his Court.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry</hi> was gladly called by his Friend <hi>Vietta</hi> to the <hi>Duke,</hi> who after much profession of trust and friendship, acquainted him with the secret; and being well instructed, dispatched him into <hi>Scotland</hi> with Letters to the King, and with those Letters, such <hi>Italian</hi> Antidotes against poyson, as the <hi>Scots</hi> till then had been strangers to.</p>
                  <p>Having parted from the <hi>Duke,</hi> he took up the Name and Language of an <hi>Italian;</hi> and thinking it best to avoid the line of <hi>English</hi> intelligence and danger, he posted into <hi>Norway,</hi> and through that
<pb facs="tcp:102693:16"/>
Country towards <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he found the King at <hi>Sterling;</hi> being there, he used means by <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ard Lindsey,</hi> one of the Kings Bed Chamber, to procure him a speedy and private conference with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, assuring him, <hi>That the business which he was to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate, was of such consequence, as had caused the Great Duke of</hi> Tuscany <hi>to enjoyn him suddenly to leave his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country of</hi> Italy, <hi>to impart it to his King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This being by <hi>Bernard Lindsey</hi> made known to the King, the King after a little wonder, (mixt with jealousie) to hear of an <hi>Italian</hi> Ambassador, or Messenger, required his Name, (which was said to be <hi>Octavio Baldi)</hi> and appointed him to be heard privately at a fixed hour that Evening.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Octavio Baldi</hi> came to the Presence-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-door, he was requested to lay aside his long <hi>Rapier</hi> (which <hi>Italian-</hi>like he then wore) and being entred the Chamber, he found there with the King three or four <hi>Scotch</hi> Lords standing distant in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral corners of the Chamber: at the sight of whom he made a stand; which the King observing, <hi>bade him be bold, and deliver his Message; for he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake for the secresie of all that were present.</hi> Then did <hi>Octavio Baldi</hi> deliver his Letters and his Message to the King in <hi>Italian;</hi> which, when the King had graciously received, after a little pause, <hi>Octavio Baldi</hi> steps to the Table, and whispers to the King in his own Language, that he was an <hi>English</hi> man, beseeching Hini for a more private conference with His Majesty, and that he might be concealed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his stay in that Nation; which was promised, and really performed by the King during all his abode there, (which was about three Months) all which time was spent with much pleasantness to the King, and with as much to <hi>Octavio Baldi</hi> himself, as
<pb facs="tcp:102693:16"/>
that Countrey could afford; from which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted as true an <hi>Italian</hi> as he came thither.</p>
                  <p>To the <hi>Duke</hi> at <hi>Florence</hi> he return'd vvith a fair and gratefull account of his imployment, and vvithin some few Moneths after his return, there came certain News to <hi>Florence,</hi> that Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> vvas dead; and, <hi>Iames</hi> King of the <hi>Scots</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King of <hi>England.</hi> The Duke knowing tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and business to be the best Schools of vvisdom, and that Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> had been tutor'd in both, advis'd him to return presently to <hi>England,</hi> and there joy the King vvith his new and better Title, and vvait there upon Fortune for a better imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>When King <hi>Iames</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> he found, amongst other of the late Queens Officers, Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> vvho vvas after Lord <hi>Wotton,</hi> Comptroller of the House, of vvhom he demanded, <hi>If he knew one</hi> Henry Wotton, <hi>that had spent much time in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Travel?</hi> The Lord replied, he knew him vvell, and that he vvas his Brother; then the <hi>King</hi> asking vvhere he then vvas, vvas answered, at <hi>Venice,</hi> or <hi>Florence;</hi> but by late Letters from thence, he understood, he vvould suddenly be at <hi>Paris. Send for him,</hi> said the King, <hi>and when he shall come into</hi> England, <hi>bid him repair privately to me.</hi> The Lord <hi>Wotton</hi> after a little vvonder, asked the King, <hi>If he knew him?</hi> to vvhich the King answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>You must rest unsatisfied of that, till you bring the Gentleman to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not many Moneths after this Discourse, the Lord <hi>Wotton</hi> brought his Brother to attend the King, vvho took him in His Arms, <hi>and bade him welcome by the Name of</hi> Octavio Baldi, <hi>saying, he was the most honest, and therefore the best Dissembler that</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:102693:17"/>
                     <hi>ever he met with:</hi> And said, <hi>Seeing I know you neither want Learning, Travel, nor Experience, and that I have had so real a Testimony of your faithfulness and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to manage an Ambassage, I have sent for you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my purpose; which is, to make use of you in that kind hereafter:</hi> And indeed the King did so most of those two and twenty years of his Raign; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dismist <hi>Octavio Baldi</hi> from his present atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him, he restored him to his old Name of <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> by vvhich he then Knighted him.</p>
                  <p>Not long after this, the King having resolved, according to his Motto <hi>(Beati pacifici)</hi> to have a friendship vvith his Neighbour-Kingdoms of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and also for divers vveighty reasons, to enter into an Alliance vvith the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> and to that end to send Ambassadors to those several places, did propose the choice of these Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Sir <hi>Henry Wotton;</hi> vvho considering the smallness of his own Estate (vvhich he never took care to augment) and knowing the Courts of great Princes to be sumptuous, and necessarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensive, inclined most to that of <hi>Venice,</hi> as being a place of more retirement, and best suiting vvith his <hi>Genius,</hi> who did ever love to joyn with Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Study, and a tryal of natural Experiments; for both which fruitfull <hi>Italy,</hi> that <hi>Darling of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Cherisher of all Arts, is so justly fam'd in all parts of the Christian World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry</hi> having after some short time and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, resolved upon <hi>Venice,</hi> and a large al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance being appointed by the <hi>King</hi> for his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age thither, and a setled maintenance during his stay there, he left <hi>England,</hi> nobly accompanied through <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> by Gentlemen of the best Families and breeding that this Nation afforded;
<pb facs="tcp:102693:17"/>
they were too many to name, but these two, for following reasons may not be omitted; Sir <hi>Albertus Morton</hi> his Nephew, who went his Secretary; and <hi>William Bedel,</hi> a man of choice Learning, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Wisdom, who went his Chaplain. And, though his dear friend Dr. <hi>Donne</hi> (then a private Gentleman) was not one of that number that did personally accompany him in this Voyage, yet the reading of this following Letter sent by him to Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> the morning before he left <hi>England,</hi> may testifie he wanted not his friends best wishes to attend him.</p>

for that he delivered his Ambassage most elegantly in the <hi>Italian</hi> Language, and came also in such a Juncture of time, as his Masters friendship seem'd usefull for that Republick: the time of his coming thither was about the year 1604. <hi>Leonardo Donato</hi> being then Duke; a wise and resolv'd man, and to all purposes such (Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> would often say it) as the State of <hi>Venice</hi> could not then have want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; there having been formerly in the time of <hi>Pope Clement</hi> the eighth, some contests about the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Church-men, and the power of the Civil Magistrate; of which, for the information of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Readers, I shall say a little, because it may give light to some passages that follow.</p>
                  <p>About the year 1603. the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> made several Injunctions against Lay-persons gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Lands or Goods to the Church, without Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence from the Civil Magistrate; and in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, they exprest their reasons to be, <hi>For that when any Goods or Land once came into the hands of the Ecclesiasticks, it was not subject to alienation; by reason whereof, (the Lay-people being at their death charitable even to excess) the Clergy grew every day more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and, pretended an exemption from all</hi> publick ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and Taxes, and from all secular Judgement: <hi>so that the burden grew thereby too heavy to be born by the Laity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another occasion of difference was, That about this time complaints were justly made by the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> against two Clergy-men, the <hi>Abbot of Nerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi> and a <hi>Canon of Vicenza,</hi> for committing such sins, as I think not fit to name; nor are these men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned with an intent to fix a Scandal upon any Calling; (for holiness is not tyed to Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Orders, and <hi>Italy</hi> is observed to breed the most
<pb facs="tcp:102693:19"/>
vertuous, and most vicious men of any Nation) these two having been long complained of at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Name of the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> and no satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction being given to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> they seized the persons of this <hi>Abbot</hi> and <hi>Canon,</hi> and committed them to prison.</p>
                  <p>The justice, or injustice of such or the like pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then used by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> had formerly had some calm debates betwixt the former Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth, and that <hi>Republick:</hi> I say, calm, for he did not excommunicate them; considering (as I conceive) that in the late <hi>Council of Trent</hi> it was at last (after many Politique disturbances, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, and endeavours to preserve the Popes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent power) in order to a general reformation of those many Errors, which were in time crept into the Church, declar'd by that Counsel, <hi>That though</hi> Discipline, <hi>and especial</hi> Excommunication <hi>be one of the chief sinews of Church Government, and intended to keep men in obedience to it: for which end, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd to be very profitable; yet, it was also declar'd, and advised to be used with great sobriety and care: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause experience had informed them, that when it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced unadvisedly, or rashly, it became more contemn'd then fear'd.</hi> And, though this was the advice of that Council at the Conclusion of it, which was not many years before this quarrel with the <hi>Venetians:</hi> yet this prudent, patient Pope <hi>Clement</hi> dying, <hi>Pope Paul</hi> the fifth, who succeeded him, (though not immediately, yet in the same year) being a man of a much hotter temper, brought this difference with the <hi>Venetians</hi> to a much higher Contention: objecting those late acts of that State, to be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of his just power, and limited a time of twenty four dayes for their revocation; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb facs="tcp:102693:19"/>
if he were not obeyed, to proceed to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication of the <hi>Republick;</hi> who still offered to shew both reason and ancient custom to warrant their Actions. But this <hi>Pope,</hi> contrary to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors moderation, required absolute obedience without disputes.</p>
                  <p>Thus it continued for about a year; the Pope still threatning Excommunication, and the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> still answering him with fair speeches, and no complyance, till at last, the Popes zeal to the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick Sea,</hi> did make him to excommunicate the <hi>Duke,</hi> the whole <hi>Senate,</hi> and all their Dominions; and that done to shut up all their <hi>Churches;</hi> charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole Clergy to forbear all sacred Offices to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> till their Obedience should render them capable of <hi>Absolution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But this act of the Popes</hi> did but the more confirm the <hi>Venetians</hi> in their resolution not to obey him; <hi>And to that end, upon the hearing of the Popes Interdict, they presently</hi> published by sound <hi>of Trumpet, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to this effect:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That whosoever hath received from</hi> Rome <hi>any Copy of a Papal Interdict, publish'd there, as well against the Law of God, as against the Honour of this Nation, shall presently render it to the Councel of</hi> Ten, <hi>upon pain of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then was <hi>Duado</hi> their Ambassador call'd home from <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Inquisition</hi> presently suspended by Order of the State; and, the Flood-gates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus set open, any man that had a pleasant or scoffing wit might safely vent it against the <hi>Pope,</hi> either by free speaking, or by Libels in Print; and, both became very pleasant to the people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:102693:20"/>
Matters thus heightned, the State advised vvith Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> a Holy and Learned Frier (the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>History of the Council of Trent)</hi> vvhose advice vvas, <hi>Neither to provoke the Pope, nor lose their own Right:</hi> he declaring publickly in Print, in the name of the State, <hi>That the Pope was trusted to keep two Keys; one of</hi> Prudence, <hi>and the other of</hi> Power: <hi>And that if they were not both used together,</hi> Power <hi>alone is not effectual in an Excommunication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus these discontents and oppositions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, till a report was blown abroad, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> were all turned <hi>Protestants:</hi> which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by many, for that it was observ'd, the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Ambassadour was so often in conference with the <hi>Senate,</hi> and his Chaplain Mr. <hi>Bedel</hi> more often with Father <hi>Paul,</hi> whom the People did not take to be his Friend: And also, for that the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> was known to give Commission to <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Justiniano,</hi> then their Ambassadour in <hi>England,</hi> to make all these Proceedings known to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and to crave a Promise of his assistance, if need should require,: and in the mean time they required the <hi>King</hi>'s advice and judgement; which was the same that he gave to <hi>Pope Clement,</hi> at his first coming to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> (that Pope then moving him to an Union with the <hi>Roman Church)</hi> namely, <hi>To endeavour the calling of a free Council, for the settlement of Peace in Christendom: and, that he doubted not, but that the French King, and divers other Princes would joyn to assist in so good a work; and, in the mean time, the sin of this Breach, both with His, and the</hi> Venetians <hi>Dominions, must of necessity lie at the</hi> Pope'<hi>s door.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this contention (vvhich lasted almost two years) the <hi>Pope</hi> grew still higher, and the <hi>Venetians</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:102693:20"/>
more and more resolv'd and careless: still acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King <hi>James</hi> with their proceedings, which was done by the help of Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedel,</hi> and <hi>Padre Paulo,</hi> whom the <hi>Venetians</hi> did then call to be one of their Consulters of State, and with his Pen to defend their just Cause: which was by him so performed, that the <hi>Pope</hi> saw plainly, he had weakned his Power by exceeding it, and offered the <hi>Venetians</hi> Absolution upon very easie terms; which the <hi>Venetians</hi> still slighting, did at last obtain, by that which was scarce so much as a shew of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging it: For, they made an order, that in that day in which they were Absolv'd, there should be no Publick Rejoycing, nor any <hi>Bonfires</hi> that night; lest the Common People might judge, that they desired an Absolution, or were Absolved for committing a Fault.</p>
                  <p>These Contests were the occasion of <hi>Padre Paulo</hi>'s knowledge and interest with King <hi>James,</hi> for whose sake principally <hi>Padre Paulo</hi> compiled that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent History of the remarkable Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> 
                     <hi rend="margQuotes">which History was, as fast as it was written,  sent in several sheets in Letters by Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedel,</hi> and others, unto King <hi>James,</hi> and the</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and there first made publick, both in <hi>English</hi> and in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Language.</p>
                  <p>For eight years after Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi>'s going into <hi>Italy,</hi> he stood fair and highly valued in the Kings opinion, but at last became much clouded by an accident, which I shall proceed to relate.</p>
                  <p>At his first going Ambassadour into <hi>Italy,</hi> as he passed through <hi>Germany,</hi> he stayed some days at <hi>Augusta;</hi> where having been in his former Travels, well known by many of the best note for Learning
<pb facs="tcp:102693:21"/>
and Ingeniousness, (those that are esteemed the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> of that Nation) with whom he passing an evening in merriments, was requested by <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Flecamore</hi> to write some Sentence in his <hi>Albo;</hi> (a Book of white Paper, which for that purpose many of the <hi>German</hi> Gentry usually carry about them) and Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> consenting to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, took an occasion from some accidental dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the present Company, to write a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant definition of an Ambassadour, in these very words:
<q>Legatus est vir bonus peregrè missus ad mentiendum Reipublicae causâ.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> could have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent should have been thus Englished:
<q>An Embassadour is an honest man, sent to <hi>lie</hi> abroad for the good of his Country.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the word for <hi>lye</hi> (being the hinge upon which the Conceit was to turn) was not so exprest in Latine, as would admit (in the hands of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy especially) so fair a construction as Sir <hi>Henry</hi> thought in <hi>English.</hi> Yet as it was, it slept quietly among other Sentences in this <hi>Albo,</hi> almost <hi>eight years,</hi> till by accident it fell into the hands of <hi>Iasper Scioppius,</hi> a Romanist, a man of a restless spirit, and a malicious Pen: who with Books against King <hi>Iames,</hi> Prints this as a Principle of that Religion professed by the King, and his Ambassadour Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> then at <hi>Venice:</hi> and in <hi>Venice</hi> it was presently after written in several Glass-windows, and spitefully declared to be Sir <hi>Henry Wottons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:102693:21"/>
This coming to the knowledge of King <hi>Iames,</hi> he apprehended it to be such an oversight, such a vveakness, or vvorse, in Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> as caused the King to express much vvrath against him: and this caused Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> to write two Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, one to <hi>Velserus</hi> (one of the Chiefs of <hi>Augusta)</hi> in the universal Language, vvhich he caused to be Printed, and given, and scattered in the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable places both of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> as an Antidote against the venomous Books of <hi>Scioppius;</hi> and another Apology to King <hi>Iames:</hi> vvhich vvere both so ingenious, so clear, and so choicely Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, that his Majesty (vvho vvas a pure Judge of it) could not forbear, at the receit thereof, to declare publickly, <hi>That Sir</hi> Henry Wotton <hi>had commuted sufficiently for a greater offence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, as broken bones vvell set become stronger; so Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> did not only recover, but vvas much more confirmed in his Majesties esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and favour then formerly he had been.</p>
                  <p>And as that Man of great Wit and useful Fancy (his Friend Dr. <hi>Donne)</hi> gave in a Will of his (a <hi>Will of Conceits)</hi> his <hi>Reputation</hi> to his <hi>Friends,</hi> and his <hi>Industry</hi> to his <hi>Foes,</hi> because from thence he received both: so those Friends, that in this time of trial laboured to excuse this facetious freedom of Sir <hi>Henry Wottons,</hi> vvere to him more dear, and by him more highly valued; and those Acquaintance that urged this as an advantage against him, caused him by this error to grovv both more vvise, and (which is the best fruit error can bring forth) for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to become more industriously vvatchful over his Tongue and Pen.</p>
                  <p>I have told you a part of his Employment in <hi>Italy,</hi> vvhere notwithstanding the death of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorer,
<pb facs="tcp:102693:22"/>
the Duke <hi>Leonardo Donato,</hi> vvho had an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissembled affection for him, and the malicious Accusation of <hi>Scioppius;</hi> yet his interest (as though it had been an intail'd love) was still found to live and increase in all the succeeding Dukes, during his Employment to that State, vvhich vvas almost twenty years; all vvhich time he studied the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of those <hi>Dukes,</hi> and the other <hi>Consulters</hi> of <hi>State;</hi> vvell knowing, that he vvho negotiates a continued business, and neglects the study of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, usually fails in his proposed ends: But in this Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> did not fail; for by a fine sorting of fit Presents, curious and not costly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, always sweetned by various and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Discourse; vvith vvhich, and his choice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Stories, and his elegant Delivery of all these, even in their <hi>Italian</hi> Language, he first got, and still preserv'd such interest in the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> that it vvas observ'd (such vvas either his (merit, or his modesty) they never denied him any request.</p>
                  <p>But, all this shews but his abilities, and his fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for that Employment: 'Twill therefore be needful to tell the Reader, vvhat use he made of the Interest vvhich these procured him; and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed vvas, rather to oblige others then to enrich himself; he still endeavoring that the Reputation of the <hi>English</hi> might be maintained, both in the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, and in <hi>Italy;</hi> vvhere many Gentlemen vvhom Travel had invited into that Nation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him chearful Entertainments, advice for their behaviour, and by his interest shelter, or deliverance from those accidental storms of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity vvhich usually attend upon Travel.</p>
                  <p>And because these things may appear to the
<pb facs="tcp:102693:22"/>
Reader to be but Generals, I shall acquaint him vvith two particular Examples; one of his Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Disposition, and one of the Nobleness of his Mind; vvhich shall follow.</p>
                  <p>There had been many <hi>English</hi> Souldiers brought by Commanders of their own Country, to serve the <hi>Venetians</hi> for pay against the <hi>Turk:</hi> and those <hi>English,</hi> having by Irregularities, or Improvidence, brought themselves into several Gallies and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> became a Petitioner to that State for their Lives and Enlargement; and his Request vvas granted: so that those (vvhich vvere many hundreds, and there made the sad Examples of Humane Misery, by hard Imprisonment, and unpitied Poverty in a strange Nation) vvere by his means released, relieved, and in a comfortable Condition sent to thank God and him for their Lives and Liberty in their own Country.</p>
                  <p>And this I have observed as one testimony of the compassionate Nature of him, vvho vvas (during his stay in those parts) as a City of Refuge for the Distressed of this and other Nations.</p>
                  <p>And for that vvhich I offer as a Testimony of the Nobleness of his Mind; I shall make vvay to the Readers clearer understanding of it, by telling him, that beside several other Foreign Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> vvas sent thrice Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to the Republick of <hi>Venice;</hi> and at his last going thither, he vvas employed Ambassadour to several of the <hi>German</hi> Princes, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the Emperor <hi>Ferdinando</hi> the second; and that his Employment to him, and those Princes, vvas to incline them to equitable Conditions, for the Restauration of the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and her Descendents, to their Patrimonial Inheritance of the <hi>Palatinate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:102693:23"/>
This vvas by his eight Months constant endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors and attendance upon the <hi>Emperor,</hi> his Court and Councel, brought to a probability of a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful Conclusion vvithout blood-shed: but there vvas at that time two opposite Armies in the Field; and as they vvere Treating, there vvas a Battle fought; in the managery vvhereof, there vvas so many miserable Errors on the one side, (so Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> expresses it in a Dispatch to the King) and so advantagious Events to the Emperour, as put an end to all present Hopes of a successful Treaty: so that Sir <hi>Henry</hi> seeing the face of Peace altered by that Victory, prepared for a Removal from that Court; and at his departure from the <hi>Emperor,</hi> vvas so bold as to remember him, <hi>That the Events of every Battle move on the unseen Wheels of Fortune, which are this moment up, and down the next: and therefore humbly advised him to use his Victory so soberly, as still to put on thoughts of Peace.</hi> Which Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, though it seemed to be spoke vvith some Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, (his dear Mistress the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> being concerned in it) vvas yet taken in good part by the <hi>Emperor;</hi> vvho replied, <hi>That he would consider his Advice: And though he looked on the King his Master as an Abettor of his Enemy the</hi> Paulsgrave; <hi>yet for Sir</hi> Henry <hi>himself, his behaviour had been such during the manage of the Treaty, that he took him to be a Person of much Honour and Merit, and did therefore desire him to accept of that Jewel, as a testimony of his good opinion of him;</hi> vvhich vvas a Jewel of Diamonds of more value then a Thousand Pounds.</p>
                  <p>This Jewel vvas received vvith all outward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances and Terms of Honour by Sir <hi>Henry Wotton:</hi> but the next morning, at his departing from <hi>Vienna,</hi> he at his taking leave of the Countess
<pb facs="tcp:102693:23"/>
of <hi>Sabrina</hi> (an <hi>Italian</hi> Lady, in whose House the Emperor had appointed him to be lodg'd, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably entertained:) <hi>he acknowledged her Merits, and besought her to accept of that Jewel, as a testimony of his gratitude for her Civilities:</hi> presenting her with the same that was given him by the <hi>Emperor:</hi> which being suddenly discovered, and told to the <hi>Emperor,</hi> was by him taken for a high affront, and Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> told so by a Messenger. To which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>That though he received it with thankefulness, yet he found in himself an indisposition to be the better for any gift that came from an Enemy to his Royal Mistress the Queen of</hi> Bohemia; for so she was pleased he should always call her.</p>
                  <p>Many other of his Services to his Prince, and this Nation, might be insisted upon: as namely, his procurations of Priviledges and Courtesies with the <hi>German</hi> Princes, and the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> for the <hi>English</hi> Merchants; and vvhat he did by direction of <hi>King James</hi> vvith the <hi>Venetian</hi> State, concerning the Bishop of <hi>Spalato</hi>'s return to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But for the particulars of these, and many more that I meant to make known, I vvant a vievv of some Papers that might inform me, (his late Majesties <hi>Letter Office</hi> having now suffered a strange alienation) and indeed I want time too; for the Printers Press stays for what is written: so that I must haste to bring Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> in an instant from <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> leaving the Reader to make up what is defective in this place, by the small supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Inscription under his Arms, which he left at all those Houses where he rested, or lodged, when he return'd from his last Embassy into <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>To <hi>London</hi> he came the year before King <hi>James</hi> died; who having for the reward of his forreign service, promised him the reversion of an Office which was fit to be turned into present money, which he wanted, for a supply of his present ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, and also granted him the reversion of the <hi>Master of the Rolls</hi> place, if he out-lived charitable Sir <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> who then possessed it: and then, grown so old, that he was said to be kept alive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Natures Course, by the prayers of those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor which he daily relieved.</p>
                  <p>But, these were but in hope; and his condition required a present support: For in the beginning of these imployments he sold to his elder Brother the Lord <hi>Wotton,</hi> the Rent-charge left by his good Father, and (which is worse) was now at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn indebted to several persons, whom he was not able to satisfie, but by the Kings payment of his Arrears due for his forreign Imployments: He had brought into <hi>England</hi> many servants, of which some were <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Artists; this was
<pb facs="tcp:102693:24"/>
part of his condition, who had many times hardly sufficient to supply the occasions of the day: (For it may by no means be said of his providence, as himself said of Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi>'s wit, <hi>That it was the very measure of congruity)</hi> He being alwayes so careless of money, as though our Saviours words, <hi>Care not for to morrow,</hi> were to be literally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
                  <p>But it pleased the God of providence, that in this jucture of time, the Provosthip of His Maye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Colledge of <hi>Eaton</hi> became void by the death of Mr. <hi>Thomas Murray,</hi> for which there were (as the place deserv'd) many earnest and powerfull Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the <hi>King.</hi> And Sir <hi>Henry</hi> who had for many years (like <hi>Siciphas)</hi> rolled the restless stone of a State-imployment; knowing experimentally, that the great blessing of sweet content was not to be found in multitudes of men or business: and, that a <hi>Colledge</hi> was the fittest place to nourish <hi>holy thoughts,</hi> and to afford rest both to his body and mind, which his age (being now almost threescore years) seemed to require, did therefore use his own, and the interest of all his friends to procure that place. By which means, and quitting the King of his promised reversionary Offices, and a piece of honest policy (which I have not time to relate) he got a Grant of it from His Majesty.</p>
                  <p>And this was a fair satisfaction to his <hi>mind:</hi> but <hi>money</hi> was wanting to furnish him with those neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries which attend removes, and a settlement in such a place; and, to procure that, he wrote to his old friend Mr. <hi>Nicholas Pey,</hi> for his assistance; of which <hi>Nicholas Pey,</hi> I shall here say a little, for the clearing of some passages that I shall mention hereafter.</p>

He was in his youth a Clerk, or in some such way, a Servant to the Lord <hi>Wotton,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry</hi>'s Brother, and by him, when he was Comptroller of the Kings Houshold, was made a great Officer in His Majesties House. This, and other favours being conferred upon Mr. <hi>Pey (in whom there was a radieal honesty)</hi> were alwayes thankfully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by him, and his gratitude exprest by a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and unwearied serviceableness to that Family even till his death.

                  <p>This money, being part of his Arrears, was by his own, and the help of honest <hi>Nicholas Pey</hi>'s inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in Court, quickly procured him; and he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And (as Sir <hi>William Davenant</hi> has happily exprest the like of another person)

                  <p>Being thus setled according to the desires of his <hi>heart,</hi> his first <hi>study</hi> was the Statutes of the <hi>Colledge:</hi> by which, he conceiv'd himself bound to enter into <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> which he did; being made <hi>Deacon</hi> with all convenient speed; shortly after which time, as he came in his <hi>Surplice</hi> from the <hi>Church ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> an old Friend, a person of Quality, met him so attired, and joyed him of his new habit; to whom Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> replied, <hi>I thank</hi> God <hi>and the</hi> King, <hi>by whose goodness I now am in this condition; a condition, which that Emperor</hi> Charles <hi>the Fifth, seem'd to approve: who, after so many remarkable Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, when his glory was great in the eyes of all men, freely gave up his</hi> Crown, <hi>and the many cares that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it, to</hi> Philip <hi>his Son, making a holy retreat to a Cloysteral life, where he might by devout</hi> meditations <hi>consult with</hi> God, (which the rich or busie men sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome do) <hi>and have leisure both to examine the errors of his life past, and prepare for that great day, wherein all flesh must make an account of their actions: And after a kind of tempestuous life, I now have the like advantage from him,</hi> that makes the out goings of the morning to praise him; <hi>even from my</hi> God, <hi>whom I daily mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie for this particular mercy, of an exemption from busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, a quiet mind, and a liberal maintenance, even in this part of my life, when my</hi> age <hi>and</hi> infirmities <hi>seem to found me a ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And now to speak a little of the imployment of his <hi>time</hi> in the Colledge. After his customary pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb facs="tcp:102693:26"/>
Devotions, his use was to retire into his <hi>Study,</hi> and there to spend some hours in reading the Bible, and Authors in Divinity, closing up his meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with private prayer; this was, for the most part his imployment in the Forenoon: But, when he was once sate to Dinner, then nothing but chearfull thoughts possess'd his mind; and, those still increased by constant company at his Table, of such persons as brought thither additions both of Learning and Pleasure; but some part of most dayes was usually spent in <hi>Philosophical Conclusions,</hi> Nor did he forget his innate pleasure of <hi>Angling,</hi> which he would usually call, <hi>his idle time, not idly spent;</hi> saying often, he would rather live five <hi>May moneths,</hi> then <hi>forty Decembers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was a great lover of his Neighbours, and a bountifull entertainer of them very often at his Table, where his meat was choice, and his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course better.</p>
                  <p>He was a constant Cherisher of all those youths in that School, in whom he found either a constant diligence, or a <hi>Genius</hi> that prompted them to Learning; for whose encouragement, he was (beside many other things of necessity and beauty) at the charge of setting up in it two rowes of <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> on which he caused to be choicely drawn, the pictures of divers of the most famous <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Historians, Poets,</hi> and <hi>Orators;</hi> perswading them not to neglect <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> because <hi>Almighty God has left Mankind affections to be wrought upon:</hi> And he would often say. <hi rend="margQuotes">
                        <hi>That none despised Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but such dull souls as were not capable of it.</hi>
                     </hi> He would also often make choice of some Observations out of those <hi>Historians</hi> and <hi>Poets:</hi> and would never leave the School, without dropping some choice

                     <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin Apothegm</hi> or sentence, that might be worthy of a room in the memory of a growing Scholar.</p>
                  <p>He was pleased constantly to breed up one or more hopefull Youths, which he picked out of the <hi>School,</hi> and took into his own Domestick care, and to attend him at his Meals; out of whose <hi>Discourse</hi> and <hi>Behaviour,</hi> he gathered observations for the better compleating of his intended work of <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> of which, by his still striving to make the whole better, he lived to leave but part to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</p>
                  <p>He was a great Enemy to <hi>wrangling Disputes</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> concerning which, I shall say a little, both to testifie that, and to shew the readiness of his Wit.</p>
                  <p>Having at his being in <hi>Rome</hi> made acquaintance with a pleasant <hi>Priest,</hi> who invited him one Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hear their Vesper <hi>Musick</hi> at <hi>Church;</hi> the Priest seeing Sir <hi>Henry</hi> stand obscurely in a corner, sends to him by a Boy of the Quire this Question, writ in a small piece of Paper, <hi>Where was your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be found before</hi> Luther?

                  </p>
                  <p>The next Vesper, Sir <hi>Henry</hi> went purposely to the same Church, and sent one of the Quire-boyes with this Question, to his honest, pleasant friend, the Priest; <hi>Do you believe all those many Thousands of poor Christians were damn'd, that were Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, because the</hi> Pope, <hi>and the Duke of</hi> Venice, <hi>could not agree about their temporal power?</hi> Speak your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.

                  </p>
                  <p>These three Chaplains to these three Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, were all bred in one Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, all of one <note n="*" place="margin">Emanuel <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> in Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge.</note> Colledge, all Benefic'd in one Diocess, and all most dear and intire Friends: But in <hi>Spain</hi> Mr. <hi>Wadsworth</hi> met vvith temptations, or reasons, such as were so powerful, as to perswade him (who of the three, was formerly observ'd to be the most averse to that Religion that calls it self <hi>Catholick)</hi> to disclaim himself a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and declare himself for the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> discharging himself of his attendance on the Ambassador, and betaking himself to a Monasterial life; in which he lived very regularly, and so died.</p>
                  <p>When Dr. <hi>Hall</hi> (the late <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Norwich)</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> he wrote to Mr. <hi>Wadsworth,</hi> ('tis the first Epistle in his Printed Decads) to perswade his

return, or to shew the reason of his Apostasie: the Letter seemed to have in it many sweet expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of love; and yet there was in it some expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion that was so unpleasant to Mr. <hi>Wadsworth,</hi> that he chose rather to acquaint his old Friend Mr. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> with his motives; by which means there past betwixt Mr. <hi>Bedil</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wadsworth</hi> divers Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which be extant in Print, and did well deserve it; for in them there seems to be a controversie, not of Religion only, but who should answer each other with most love and meekness: which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the rather, because it too seldom falls out to be so in a Book-War.</p>
                  <p>There is yet a little more to be said of Mr. <hi>Bedel,</hi> for the greatest part of which, the Reader is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to this following Letter of Sir <hi>Henry Wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi> writ to our late King <hi>Charles</hi> the first.</p>

                           <hi>HAving been informed that certain persons have, by the good wishes of the</hi> Archbishop <hi>of</hi> Armagh, <hi>been directed hither, with a most humble Petition unto Your Majesty, that You will be pleased to make Mr.</hi> William Bedel <hi>(now resident upon a small Benefice in</hi> Suffolk) <hi>Governor of Your Colledge at</hi> Dublin, <hi>for the good of that Society; and my self being required to render unto Your Majesty some testimony of the said</hi> William Bedel, <hi>who was long my Chaplain at</hi> Venice, <hi>in the time of my first employment there; I am bound in all Conscience and Truth (so far as Your Majesty will vouchsafe to accept my poor judgement) to affirm of him, That I think hardly a fitter man for that Charge, could have been propounded unto Your Majesty in Your whole Kingdom, for singular Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Piety, Conformity to the Rites of the</hi> Church, <hi>and Zeal to advance the Cause of God; wherein his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels</hi>

                           <hi>For it may please Your Majesty to know, that this is the man whom</hi> Padre Paulo <hi>took I may say, into his very soul, with whom he did communicate the inwardest thoughts of his heart, from whom he professed to have received more knowledge in all</hi> Divinity, <hi>both Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical and Positive, than from any that he had ever pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised in his dayes; of which, all the passages were well known to the King Your Father, of most blessed memory. And so with Your Majesties good favour, I will end this needless Office; for the general Fame of his Learning, his Life, and Christian temper, and those Religious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours which himself hath dedicated to Your Majesty, do better describe him then I am able.</hi>

                  <p>TO this Letter, I shall add this; That he was (to the great joy of Sir <hi>Henry Wotton)</hi> made Governor of the said Colledge; and that <note n="*" place="margin">August, 1627.</note> after a fair discharge of his duty and trust there, he was thence removed to be <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Kilmore.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Sept. 3. 1629.</note> In both which places, his life was so holy, as seemed to equal the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christians; for as they, so he kept all the <hi>Ember-weeks,</hi> observed (besides his private devotions) the <hi>Canonical</hi> hours of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er very strictly, and so he did all the Feasts, and Fast dayes of his Mother, the Church of <hi>England;</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:102693:30"/>
to which I may add, that his Patience and Charity were both such, as shewed his affections were set upon <hi>things that are above;</hi> for indeed his whole life brought forth the <hi>fruits of the Spirit;</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him such a remarkable meekness, that as St. <hi>Paul</hi> advised his <hi>Timothy</hi> in the Election of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>That he have a good report of those that be without;</hi> so had he, <hi>for those that were without,</hi> even those that in point of Religion, whereof the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> perswasion (of which there were very many in his Diocess) did yet (such is the power of visible Piety) ever look upon him with respect and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and, testified it, by a concealing, and safe protecting him from death in the late horrid Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> when the fury of the wild <hi>Irish</hi> knew no distinction of persons; and yet, there, and then, he was protected and cherished by those of a contrary perswasion; and there, and then he dyed, not by violence or misusage, but by grief in a quiet Prison<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>More might be said of Mr. <hi>Bedel,</hi> who (I told the Reader) was Sir <hi>Henry Wottons</hi> first Chaplain; and much of his second Chaplain, <hi>Isaac Bargrave,</hi> Doctor in <hi>Divinity,</hi> and the late learned and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitable Dean of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> as also of the Meri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

already carried him too far from <hi>Eaton Colledge,</hi> and therefore I shall lead him back as gently, and as orderly as I may to that place, for a further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference concerning Sir <hi>Henry Wotton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> had propos'd to himself; before he entred into his Collegiate life, to write the life of <hi>Martin Luther;</hi> and in it, the History of the Reformation, as it was carried on in <hi>Germany:</hi> For the doing of which, he had many advantages by his several Embassies into those pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>This is some account both of his inclination, and the employment both of his time in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, where he seemed to have his <hi>Youth</hi> renewed

by a continual conversation with that Learned So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and a daily recourse of other Friend of choicest breeding and parts, by which, that great blessing of a chearfull heart vvas still maintained; he being alwayes free, even to the last of his day, from that peevishness which usually attends Age.</p>

                     <hi>true; that, at my now being in that School, and seeing that very place where I sate when I was a Boy, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned me to remember those very thoughts of my youth which then possessed me; sweet thoughts indeed, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised my growing years numerous pleasures, without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of cares; and those to be enjoyed, when time (which I therefore thought slow pac'd) had changed my</hi> youth <hi>into</hi> manhood: <hi>But, age and experience have taught me, that those were but empty hopes: For I have alwayes found it true, as my</hi> Saviour <hi>did foretell,</hi> Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the day is the evil thereof. <hi>Nevertheless, I saw there a succession of Boyes using the same recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and, questionless possessed with the same thoughts that then possessed me. Thus, one generation succeeds another, both in their</hi> lives, recreations, hopes, fears, and deaths.</p>
                  <p>After his return from <hi>Winchester</hi> to <hi>Eaton</hi> (vvhich vvas about five Moneths before his death) he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came much more retir'd, and contemplative; in vvhich time he vvas often visited by Mr. <hi>John Hales,</hi> (learned Mr. <hi>John Hales)</hi> then a Fellow of that Colledge, to vvhom upon an occasion he spake to this purpose—<hi>I have in my passage to my grave met with most of those Joys of which a discoursive soul is capable: and, being entertain'd with more inferior pleasures then the sons of men are usually made partakers of: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, in this voyage I have not alwayes floated on the calm Sea of Content; but, have often met with cross winds and storms, and, with many troubles of mind and temptations to evil. And yet, though I have been and am a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd about with humane frailties, Almighty God hath by his grace prevented me from making shipwrack of faith and a good Conscience; the thought of which is now the joy of my heart, and, I most humbly praise him for it; And, I humbly acknowledge that it was not my self but he that</hi>

                     <hi>hath kept me to this great age, and, let him take the glory of his great mercy.—And, my dear Friend, I now see that I draw near my harbour of death: that harbour, that will secure me from all the future storms and waves of this restless world; and, I praise God I am willing to leave it, and expect a better; that world,</hi> vvherein dwelleth Righteousness.—These, and the like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions vvere then utter'd by him at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Feavourish distemper, at vvhich time he vvas also troubled vvith an <hi>Asthma,</hi> or short spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; but after less then twenty fits, by the help of familiar Physick and a spare Diet, this Feaver abated, yet so as to leave him much vveaker then it found him: and, his <hi>Asthma</hi> seem'd also to be overcome in a good degree by his forbearing <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,</hi> vvhich, as many thoughtfull men do, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so had taken somewhat immoderately.—This vvas his then present condition; and, thus he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till about the end of <hi>October</hi> 1639. vvhich vvas about a moneth before his death, at vvhich time, he again fell into a <hi>Feaver,</hi> vvhich, though he seem'd to recover, yet these still left him so vveak, that they and those other common infirmities that accompany age, and vvere vvont to visit him like civil friends, and, after some short time to leave him; came now, both oftner and vvith more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and at last took up their constant habitation vvith him, still vveakning his Body and abating his chearfulness: of both vvhich he grew more sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and did the oftner retire into his Study, and there made many Papers that had pass'd his Pen both in the dayes of his youth, and in the busie part of his life, useless, by a fire made there to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.—These and several unusuall expressions to his Servants and Friends, seem'd to foretell that
<pb facs="tcp:102693:36"/>
the day of his death drew near: for vvhich, he seem'd to those many friends that observ'd him, to be vvell prepar'd, and to be both patient, and free from all fear, as several of his Letters vvrit on this his last sick bed may testifie: and thus he continued till about the beginning of <hi>December</hi> following, at vvhich time he vvas seiz'd more violently vvith a <hi>Quotidian Feaver,</hi> in the tenth fit of vvhich Feaver, his better part, that part of Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> vvhich could not die, put off mortality vvith as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and chearfulness as humane frailty is capable of; being then in great tranquillity of mind, and in perfect peace vvith God and man.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Have vvritten to you heretofore sometimes in private, but have a concern upon me now to do it also in publick, of vvhich (vvith your permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) I desire thus to inform you.</p>
                  <p>At the last <hi>Frankefurt Mart</hi> there vvas set to sale a certain Book of Bulk (vvhich often gives the value) not inconsiderable. And it bore this Inscription:
<q>
                        <hi>Jaspar Scioppius</hi> his <hi>Ecclesiasticus:</hi> opposed to the Authority of the most Serene Lord King <hi>James</hi>—vvherein as vvith Arguments for the most part new, and in a vvay hitherto by no man trac'd—And so on vvith the like modesty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Composer of this VVork, in his begging Scraps all about, I know not by vvhat means, seems to have lighted on a merry definition of an Ambassador, vvhich above eight years before pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by that vvay, I had chanced to set down at my Friend's Mr. <hi>Christopher Fleckamor,</hi> in his <hi>Album</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:102693:40"/>
Friends, after the <hi>German</hi> custome, <hi>(a white Paper-Book used by the</hi> Dutch <hi>for such kind of Mottos)</hi> which was worded thus:
<q>Legatus est vir bonus peregrè missus ad mentiendum Reipub. causâ. <hi>In English, being only this Jest;</hi> An Ambassador is an honest man sent to lye abroad for the Commonwealth.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Definition perhaps so Catholick, that it may comprehend even the Popes Legates; Now, what, I pray, think you doth this <hi>Scioppius</hi> hereupon? Throws open the Cabinet of familiarity, after so many years, revives an obsolete conceipt, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd from disturbance even by its Antiquity, and according to his civility adorns me with a most gentle construction, as if I had written it not only in good earnest, but even with ostentation. Nor satisfi'd with this, he endeavours to draw a blemish from my merriment, upon the untainted reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the best of Kings; as if Masters were oblig'd to answer for their Servants triflings. Lastly, To varnish over his perversness, he puts in a passage or two out of <hi>Esay</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> pleasantly, as nothing is secure from a prophane wit.</p>
                  <p>This I confess befell me in a wondrous age; for, who could have imagin'd so ill humour'd a creature likely to be born, whom such a little fancy upon the Licence of Ambassadors, (who act only in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks) should so grievously offend; whereas we daily see the severity it self of holy Writ, so foully adulterated by some that are Masters of equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, pious frauds, and mental reservations? And this not by the by, nor in jest, or in the <hi>Album</hi> of Friends, where idle things and truths us'd to be
<pb facs="tcp:102693:40"/>
set down vvith equal security, but on set purpose, and from the Pulpit, vvith priviledge and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Superiors? Yea but it is <hi>Scioppius</hi> that has rose up, and vvhat answer from me doth he expect? I remember indeed that being at <hi>Venice,</hi> my Family vvas struck vvith an <hi>Anathema</hi> in <hi>Baronius</hi> his <hi>Parae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis;</hi> I remember that then also some things of the like sort vvere cast at me by <hi>Gomitulus,</hi> a Jesuit of <hi>Perugia,</hi> and by <hi>Authony Possevin,</hi> vvhich, although they flow'd from galled spirits, yet however I bore in silence, for, these vvere men of no mean repute, at least at home, and, such eminency as they had, qualifi'd the injury. But vvhen a hungry Renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, a dirty Sharker about the <hi>Romish</hi> Court, only scribbles that he may dine, and a raw Pedant, not at all vers'd in more solid Learning, falls to treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Church-matters; vvhen the spawn of a Sexton, and an Ammunition Trull, <note n="*" place="margin">See what is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished of the Life and Parents of <hi>Scioppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> pag. 127.</note> rages vvith that ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverence against a King, vvhose eminent knowledge in things divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and constant even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Justice, vvould beget a veneration to any private person; vvhen a <hi>German</hi> quitting the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and honesty of his Countrey, breathes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing throughout his vvhole Book but the subversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Kings and Kingdomes; vvhen, finally, the same mouth vvhich had called the Society of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits, a company of Parricides; and now having begun to smell the <hi>Roman</hi> Kitchins, styles them the <hi>Praetorian Band of Gods Militia: Quis iniquae tam pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiens Urbis, quae istud Animal pabulatur, tàm ferreus &amp; teneat se?</hi> VVho can endure so base a City (that seeds the Beast) or is so insensible as to contain himself?</p>

                  <p>I <hi>Shall not need (like the most part of Writers) to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the</hi> Subject <hi>which I deliver; In that point I am at ease. For</hi> Architecture <hi>can want no commendation, where there are</hi> Noble-Men, <hi>or</hi> Noble Minds; <hi>I will therefore spend this</hi> Preface, <hi>rather about those from whom I have gathered my knowledge: For I am but a gatherer and disposer of other mens stuff, at my best value.</hi>

                     <hi>Our principal</hi> Master <hi>is</hi> Vitruvius, <hi>and so I shall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten call him; who had this</hi> felicity, <hi>that he wrote when the</hi> Roman Empire <hi>was neer the pitch: Or at least, when</hi> Augustus <hi>(who favoured his endeavours) had some meaning (if he were not mistaken) to bound the</hi> Monarchie: <hi>This, I</hi>

                     <hi>say, was his good hap; For in grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enlarging times,</hi> Arts <hi>are commonly drowned in</hi> Action: <hi>But on the other side, it was in truth an</hi> unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, <hi>to express himself so ill, especially writing (as he did) in a season of the ablest</hi> Pens; <hi>And his</hi> obscurity <hi>had this strange fortune, That though he were best practis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and best followed by his own</hi> Country-men; <hi>yet after the receiving and repolishing of good</hi> Literature <hi>(which the combustions and tumults of the</hi> middle-age <hi>had</hi> unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized) <hi>he was best, or at least, first understood by</hi> Strangers: <hi>For of all the</hi> Italians <hi>that took him in hand, those that were</hi> Grammarians <hi>seem to have wanted</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical <hi>knowledge; and the</hi> Mathematicians <hi>perhaps</hi>

                     <hi>wanted</hi> Grammar: <hi>till both were sufficiently conjoyned, in</hi> Leon-Batisti Alberti <hi>the</hi> Florentine, <hi>whom I repute the first learned</hi> Architect <hi>beyond the Alpes: But he stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died more indeed to make himself an</hi> Author, <hi>then to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate his</hi> Master: <hi>Therefore amongst his Commenters, I must (for my private conceit) yeeld the chief praise unto the</hi> French, <hi>in</hi> Philander; <hi>and to the high</hi> Germans <hi>in</hi> Gualterius Rivius: <hi>who, besides his Notes, hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise published the most elaborate</hi> Translation, <hi>that I think is extant in any Vulgar Speech of the World: though not without bewailing, now and then, some defect of</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial <hi>terms in his</hi> own; <hi>as I must likewise: For if the</hi> Saxon <hi>(our Mother-tongue) did complain; as justly, I doubt, in this point may the Daughter:</hi> Languages, <hi>for the most part, in terms of</hi> Art <hi>and</hi> Erudition, <hi>retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Original poverty, and rather growing rich and abundant in complemental Phrases and such froth. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers</hi> Modern <hi>men that have written out of meer pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, I shall give them their due upon occasion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And now, after this short Censure of others, I would fain satisfie an</hi> Objection <hi>or two, which seem to lye some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what heavily upon my selfe: It will be sayd, That I handle an</hi> Art, <hi>no way sutable either to my</hi> Imployments, <hi>or to my</hi> Fortune. <hi>And so I shall stand charged, both with</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion, <hi>and with</hi> Impertinency.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the first I answer, That though by the ever-acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged goodness of my most</hi> dear <hi>and</hi> gracious <hi>Soveraign, and by his long indulgent tolerations of my defects, I have born abroad some part of his</hi> civil <hi>service; yet when I came home, and was again resolved into mine own simplicity, I found it fitter for my</hi> Pen <hi>(at least in this first Publick adventure) to deal with these plain</hi> Compilements, <hi>and tractable</hi> Materials, <hi>then with the</hi> Laberynths <hi>and</hi> My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries <hi>of</hi> Courts <hi>and</hi> States: <hi>And less presumption for me, who have long contemplated a famous</hi> Republick, <hi>to</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>To the</hi> Second, <hi>I must shrink up my shoulders, as I have learn'd abroad, and confess indeed, that my fortune is very unable to</hi> exemplifie <hi>and</hi> actuate <hi>my</hi> Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>in this</hi> Art, <hi>which yet in truth, made me the rather even from my very disability, take encouragement to hope, that my present</hi> Labour <hi>would find the more favour in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, since it was undertaken for no mans</hi> sake <hi>less then mine</hi> own. <hi>And with that confidence, I fell into these thoughts; Of which, there were two wayes to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; The one</hi> Historical, <hi>by description of the principal</hi> Works, <hi>performed already in good part by</hi> Goirgio Vassari <hi>in the Lives of</hi> Architects. <hi>The other</hi> Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, <hi>by casting the rules and cautions of this</hi> Art <hi>into some comportable</hi> Method, <hi>whereof I have made choice, not onely as the shortest and most</hi> Elemental, <hi>but indeed as the soundest. For though in practical</hi> knowledges, <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very compleat</hi> Example <hi>may bear the credit of a</hi> Rule; <hi>yet per adventure</hi> Rules <hi>should precede, that we may by them be made fit to judge of</hi> Examples: <hi>Therefore to the</hi> purpose; <hi>for I will preface no longer.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>End</hi> is to build well.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Well-building</hi> hath three Conditions, <hi>Commodity, Firmness,</hi> and <hi>Delight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A common Division among the Deliverers of this <hi>Art,</hi> though I know not how, somewhat misplaced by <hi>Vitruvius</hi> himself, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. whom I shall be willinger to follow as a Master of <hi>Proportion,</hi> then of <hi>Method.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, For the attaining of these <hi>Intentions,</hi> we may consider the whole <hi>Subject</hi> under two general Heads:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:102693:47"/>
The <hi>Seat,</hi> and the <hi>Work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore first touching <hi>Situation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Precepts</hi> thereunto belonging, do either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the <hi>Total Posture</hi> (as I may term it) or the <hi>Placing</hi> of the <hi>Parts;</hi> whereof the first sort, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever usually set down by <hi>Architects</hi> as a piece of their <hi>Profession,</hi> yet are in truth borrowed from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Learnings:</hi> there being between <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> as well as between <hi>Men,</hi> a kind of good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, and communication of their <hi>Principles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For you shall finde some of them to be meerly <hi>Physical,</hi> touching the quality and temper of the <hi>Aire:</hi> which being a perpetual ambient and ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and the defects thereof incorrigible in single <hi>Habitations</hi> (which I most intend) doth in those respects require the more exquisite caution: That it be not too <hi>gross,</hi> nor too <hi>penetrative;</hi> Not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to any foggy noisomness, from <hi>Pens</hi> or <hi>Marshes</hi> neer adjoyning; nor to <hi>Mineral</hi> Exhalations from the Soil it self. Not indigested, for want of <hi>Sun:</hi> Not unexercised, for want of <hi>Wind:</hi> which were to live, as it were, in a <hi>Lake,</hi> or standing <hi>Pool</hi> of <hi>Aire,</hi> as <hi>Alberti</hi> the <hi>Florentine Architect</hi> doth inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously compare it.</p>
                  <p>Some do rather seem a little <hi>Astrological,</hi> as when they warn us from places of malign <hi>Influence,</hi> where <hi>Earth-quakes, Contagions, Prodigious births,</hi> or the like, are frequent without any evident cause, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Consideration is peredventure not altogether vain: Some are plainly <hi>Oeconomical,</hi> as that the <hi>Seat</hi> be well watered, and well fuelled; that it be not of too steep and incommodious <hi>Access,</hi> to the trouble both of <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Family;</hi> that it lye not too far from some <hi>Navigable River,</hi> or <hi>Arm</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> for more ease of <hi>provision,</hi> and such other <hi>Domestic</hi> notes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:102693:48"/>
Some again may be said to be <hi>Optical:</hi> Such I mean as concern the <hi>Properties</hi> of a well chosen <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,</hi> which I will call the <hi>Royalty of Sight.</hi> For as there is a <hi>Lordship,</hi> as it were, of the <hi>Fee,</hi> wherein the Master doth much joy when he walketh about the <hi>Line</hi> of his own <hi>Possessions:</hi> So there is a <hi>Lordship</hi> likewise of the <hi>Eye,</hi> which being a Ranging, and Imperious, and (I might say) an <hi>Usurping Sense,</hi> can indure no narrow <hi>Circumscription;</hi> but must be fed both with extent and variety. Yet on the other side, I find vast and indifinite views which drown all apprehension of the uttermost <hi>Objects,</hi> condemned by good Authors, as if thereby some part of the pleasure, whereof we speak, did perish. Lastly, I remember a private <hi>Caution;</hi> which I know not well how to sort, unless I should call it <hi>Political:</hi> By no means, to build too neer a great <hi>Neighbour;</hi> which were, in truth, to be as unfortunately seated on the Earth, as <hi>Mercury</hi> is in the Heavens, for the most part, ever in <hi>combustion</hi> or <hi>obscurity</hi> under brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beams then his own.</p>
                  <p>From these several <hi>Knowledges,</hi> as I have said, and perhaps from some other, do <hi>Architects</hi> derive their Doctrine about Election of <hi>Seats:</hi> wherein I have not been so severe as a <note n="*" place="margin">Ioannes Heurnius Instit. Medicin. lib. 7. cap. 2.</note> great Scholer of our time, who precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly restraineth a perfect <hi>Situation,</hi> at least for the maine point of health, <hi>Ad locum contra quem Sol radios suos fundit cum sub Ariete oritur:</hi> That is, in a word, he would have the first <hi>Salutation</hi> of the <hi>Spring.</hi> But such <hi>Notes</hi> as these, wheresoever we find them in grave or slight Authours, are to my conceit rather <hi>Wishes</hi> then <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi> and in that quality I will pass them over. Yet I must withal say, That in the <hi>seating</hi> of our selves
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102693:48"/>
(which is a kind of <hi>Marriage</hi> to a <hi>Place.) Builders</hi> should be as circumspect as <hi>Wooers,</hi> lest when all is done, that <hi>Doom</hi> befall us, which our Master doth lay upon <hi>Mytelene: A Town, in truth</hi> (saith he) <hi>finely built, but</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Opidum quidem aedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatum eleganter, sed imprudenter posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</note> 
                     <hi>foolishly planted.</hi> And so much touching that which I termed the <hi>Total Posture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next in Order is the placing of the <hi>Parts;</hi> About which (to leave as little as I may in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent labour, unto <hi>Fancie,</hi> which is wild and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar) I will propound a Rule of mine own Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, upon which I fell in this manner. I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that all <hi>Art</hi> was then in truest perfection, when it might be reduced to some natural <hi>Principle.</hi> For what are the most judicious <hi>Artisans,</hi> but the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miques</hi> of <hi>Nature?</hi> This led me to contemplate the Fabrick of our own bodies, wherein the <hi>High Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect</hi> of the World had displayed such skill, as did stupifie all humane Reason. There I found the <hi>Heart,</hi> as the Fountain of Life, placed about the Middle, for the more equal communication of the vital spirits. The <hi>Eyes</hi> seated aloft, that they might describe the greater Circle within their view. The <hi>Arms</hi> projected on each side, for ease of reaching. Briefly (not to lose our selves in this speculation) it plainly appeareth, as a <hi>Maxime</hi> drawn from the Divine Light, That the Place of every part is to be determined by the <hi>Use.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then from Natural <hi>Structure,</hi> to proceed to Artificial; and in the rudest things, to preserve some <hi>Image</hi> of the excellentest, Let all the principal Chambers of <hi>Delight,</hi> all <hi>Studies</hi> and <hi>Libraries,</hi> be toward the <hi>East:</hi> For the Morning is a Friend to the Muses. All Offices that require heat, as <hi>Kitchins,</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:102693:49"/>
                     <hi>Stillatories, Stoves,</hi> rooms for <hi>baking, brewing, wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or the like; would be <hi>Meridional.</hi> All that need a cool and fresh temper, as <hi>Cellers, Pantries, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, Granaries,</hi> to the <hi>North.</hi> To the same side likewise all that are appointed for gentle Motion, as <hi>Galleries,</hi> especially in warme Climes; or that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise require a steady and unvariable light, as <hi>Pinacothecia</hi> (saith <hi>Vitruvius)</hi> by which he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (if I might guess at his <hi>Greek,</hi> as we must do often even at his <hi>Latin)</hi> certain <hi>Repositories</hi> for works of Rarity in Picture or other Arts, by the <hi>Italians</hi> called <hi>Studioli;</hi> which at any other Quarter where the course of the <hi>Sun</hi> doth diversifie the <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi> would lose much of their grace. And by this Rule, having alwayes regard to the <hi>Use,</hi> any other Part may be fitly accommodated.</p>
                  <p>I must here not omit to note, That the Ancient <hi>Grecians,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> by their example; in their Buildings abroad, where the <hi>Seat</hi> was free, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Religiously situate the <hi>Front</hi> of their Houses towards the South: perhaps that the Masters <hi>Eye,</hi> when he came home, might not be dazled, or that being illustrated by the <hi>Sun,</hi> it might yield the more graceful Aspect, or some such reason. But from this the Modern <hi>Italians</hi> do vary. whereof I shall speak more in another place. Let thus much suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at the present for the <hi>Position</hi> of the several <hi>Members,</hi> wherein must be had, as our Authour doth often insinuate, and especially <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. a singular regard to the nature of the <hi>Region:</hi> Every Nation being tyed above all Rules whatsoever, to a discretion of providing against their own <hi>Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences:</hi> And therefore a good <hi>Parlour</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> would perchance make a good <hi>Cellar</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:102693:49"/>
There now followeth the second Branch of the general <hi>Section</hi> touching the <hi>Work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Work,</hi> I will first consider the principal parts, and afterwards the Accessory, or <hi>Ornaments;</hi> And in the Principal, first the Preparation of the <hi>Materials;</hi> and then the Disposition, which is the <hi>Form.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, concerning the <hi>Material</hi> Part; Although surely it cannot disgrace an <hi>Architect,</hi> which doth so well become a Philosopher, to look into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Wood:</hi> as that Firtrees, Cypresses, Cedars, and such other <hi>Aereal</hi> aspiring <hi>Plants,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a kind of natural rigour (which in a Man I would call Pride) inflexible downwards, are thereby fittest for <hi>Posts</hi> or <hi>Pillars,</hi> or such upright use: that on the other side, Oak, and the like true hearty Timber, being strong in all Positions, may be better trusted in cross and traverse Work; for <hi>Summers,</hi> or girding or binding <hi>Beams,</hi> as they term them. And so likewise to observe of <hi>Stone,</hi> that some are better within, and other to bear <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> Nay, to descend lower, even to examine <hi>Sand,</hi> and <hi>Lyme</hi> and <hi>Clay</hi> (of all which things <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius</hi> hath discoursed, without any daintiness; and the most of new Writers) I say, though the <hi>Speculative</hi> Part of such knowledge be <hi>liberal:</hi> yet to redeem this Profession, and my present pains from indignity; <hi>I</hi> must here remember, That to choose and sort the <hi>Materials</hi> for every part of the <hi>Fabrick,</hi> is a Duty more proper to a second <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendent</hi> over all the Under-Artisans, called (as I take it) by our Authour, <hi>Officinator lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. and in that place expresly distinguished from the <hi>Architect,</hi> whose glory doth more consist in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signment, and <hi>Idea</hi> of the whole <hi>Work;</hi> and his

truest ambition should be to make the <hi>Form,</hi> which is the nobler Part, as it were, triumph over the <hi>Matter:</hi> whereof I cannot but mention by the way, a forrein Patron; namely, the Church of <hi>Santa Giustana</hi> in <hi>Padoua:</hi> In truth, a sound piece of good Art, where the <hi>Materials</hi> being but ordinary Stone, without any garnishment of Sculpture. do yet ravish the beholder (and be knows not how) by a secret <hi>Harmony</hi> in the <hi>Proportions.</hi> And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is that end, at which in some degree we should aim even in the privatest works: whereunto though I make hast, yet let me first collect a few of the least trivial Cautions belonging to the <hi>Material</hi> Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>

                     <hi>Leon Batista Alberti</hi> is so curious, as to wish all the <hi>Timber</hi> cut out of the same <hi>Forrest,</hi> and all the <hi>Stone</hi> out of the same <hi>Quarry.</hi>

                     <hi>Philibert de 'l Orme</hi> the <hi>French Architect</hi> goes yet somewhat further, and would have the <hi>Lyme</hi> made of the very same <hi>Stone,</hi> which we intend to imploy in the <hi>Work;</hi> as, belike, imagining, that they will sympathize and joyn the better by a king of <hi>Original</hi> kindred. But such conceits as these, seem somewhat too fine among this <hi>Rubbage,</hi> though I do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them in sport. For surely, the like agreements of nature may have oftentimes a discreet applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Art. Alwayes it must be confessed, that to make <hi>Lyme</hi> without any great choice, of refuse stuffe, as we commonly do, is an <hi>English</hi> errour of no small moment in our Buildings. Whereas the <hi>Italians</hi> at this day, and much more the <hi>Ancients,</hi> did burn their firmest <hi>Stone,</hi> and even fragments of <hi>Marble,</hi> where it was copious, which in time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came almost <hi>Marble</hi> again, or at least of indissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble durity, as appeareth in the standing <hi>Theaters.</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:102693:50"/>
I must here not omit, while I am speaking of this part, a certain form of <hi>Brick</hi> described by <hi>D. Barbaro,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> in the largest Edition of his Commentary upon <hi>Vitruvius.</hi> The Figure triangular, every side a foot long, and some inch and a ½ thick, which he doth commend unto us for many good conditions: As that they are more commodious in the management, of less expence, of fairer show, adding much beauty and strength to the <hi>Mural An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles,</hi> where they fall gracefully into an indented <hi>Work:</hi> so as I should wonder that we have not taken them into use, being prpounded by a man of good authority in this knowledge; but that all Nations do start at <hi>Novelties,</hi> and are indeed marryed to their own <hi>Moulds.</hi> Into this place might aptly fall a doubt, which some have well moved; whether the ancient <hi>Italians</hi> did burn their <hi>Brick</hi> or no; which a passage or two in <hi>Vitruvius</hi> hath left Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous. Surely, where the <hi>Natural</hi> heat is strong enough to supply the <hi>Artificial,</hi> it were but a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious folly to multiply both <hi>Labour</hi> and <hi>Expence.</hi> And it is besides, very probable, that those <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials</hi> with a kindly and temperate heat wauld prove fairer, smoother, and less distorted, then with a violent: Onely they suffer two exceptions. First, that by such a gentle drying much time will be lost, which might otherwise be employed in compiling. Next, That they will want a certain sucking and soaking <hi>Thirstiness,</hi> or a fiery appetite to drink in the <hi>Lime,</hi> which must knit the <hi>Fabrick.</hi> But this question may be confined to the <hi>South,</hi> where there is more Sun and patience. I will therefore not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my course, with this incident scruple, but close that part which I have now in hand, about the <hi>Materials,</hi> with a principal caution: That sufficient
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102693:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Stuff</hi> and <hi>Money</hi> be ever ready before we begin: For when we build now a piece, and then another by fits, the <hi>Work</hi> dries and sinks unequally, whereby the Walls grow full of <hi>Chinks</hi> and <hi>Crevices;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such pawsings are well reproved by <hi>Palladio, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and by all other. And so having gleaned these few remembrances touching the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the <hi>Matter,</hi> I may now proceed to the <hi>Disposition</hi> thereof, which must form the <hi>Work.</hi> In the <hi>Form,</hi> as I did in the <hi>Seat,</hi> I will first consider the general <hi>Figuration,</hi> and then the several <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Figures</hi> are either simple or mixed. The simple be either <hi>Circular</hi> or <hi>Angular.</hi> And of circular either <hi>Compleat</hi> or <hi>Deficient,</hi> as <hi>Ovals;</hi> with which kinds I will be contented, though the Distribution might be more curious.</p>
                  <p>Now the exact <hi>Circle</hi> is in truth a Figure, which for our purpose hath many fit and eminent proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; as fitness for Commodity and Receipt, being the most capable, fitness for strength and duration, being the most united in his parts; fitness for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and delight, as imitating the Celestial <hi>Orbs,</hi> and the universal <hi>Form.</hi> And it seems besides, to have the approbation of <hi>nature,</hi> when she worketh by <hi>Instinct,</hi> which is her secret School: For Birds do build their Nests <hi>Spherically:</hi> But notwithstanding these Attributes, it is in truth a very unprofitable Figure in private <hi>Fabricks,</hi> as being of all other the most chargable, and much room lost in the bending of the <hi>Walls,</hi> when it comes to be divided, besides an ill distribution of light, except from the Center of the <hi>Roof.</hi> So as anciently it was not usual, save in their <hi>Temples</hi> and <hi>Amphi-Theaters,</hi> which needed no Compartitions. The <hi>Ovals</hi> and other imperfect
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102693:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
secular Forms, have the same exceptions, and less benefit of capacity: So as there remains to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in this general survey of <hi>Figures,</hi> the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi> and the <hi>Mixed</hi> of both, Touching the <hi>Angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> it may perchance sound somewhat strangely, but it is a true observation, that this <hi>Art</hi> doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther love many <hi>Angles,</hi> nor few. For first, the <hi>Triangle,</hi> which hath the fewest sides and corners, is of all other the most condemned, as being indeed both incapable and infirme (whereof the reason shall be afterwards rendred) and likewise unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvable into any other regular <hi>Form</hi> then it self in the inward <hi>Partitions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for Figures of five, six, seven, or more <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles:</hi> They are surely fitter for <hi>Militar Architecture</hi> (where the Bulworks may be layd out at the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and the sides serve for <hi>Curtains)</hi> then for civil use; though I am not ignorant of that famous Piece at <hi>Capralora,</hi> belonging to the House of <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese,</hi> cast by <hi>Baroccio</hi> into the form of a <hi>Pentagone,</hi> with a Circle inscribed, where the <hi>Architect</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniously wrestle with divers inconveniences in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposing of the <hi>Lights,</hi> and in saving the vacuities. But as designs of such nature do more aym at Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity then Commodity; so, for my part, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther admire them then commend them.</p>
                  <p>These things considered, we are both by the Precepts, and by the Practice of the best Builders; to resolve upon <hi>Rectangular Squares,</hi> as a mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween too few and too many Angles; and through the equal inclination of the sides (which make the right Angle) stronger then the <hi>Rhombe,</hi> or <hi>Losenge,</hi> or any other irregular <hi>Square.</hi> But whether the exact <hi>Quadrat,</hi> or the long <hi>Square</hi> be the better, I find not well determined, though in mine owne
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102693:52"/>
conceit, I must prefer the latter; provided that the <hi>Length</hi> do not exceed the <hi>Latitude</hi> above one third part, which would diminish the beauty of the <hi>Aspect,</hi> as shall appear when I come to speak of <hi>Symmetry</hi> and <hi>Proportion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of mixed Figures, partly <hi>Circular,</hi> and partly <hi>Angular,</hi> I shall need to say nothing; because ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving handled the simple already, the mixed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their composition, do participate of the same respects. Onely against these, there is a proper <hi>Objection,</hi> that they offend <hi>Uniformity:</hi> Whereof I am therefore oppertunely induced to say somewhat, as far as shall concern the outward <hi>Aspect,</hi> which is now in Discourse.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Architecture,</hi> there may seem to be two oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site affectations, <hi>Uniformity</hi> and <hi>Variety,</hi> which yet will very well suffer a good reconcilement, as we may see in the great Pattern of <hi>Nature,</hi> to which I must often resort: For surely, there can be no <hi>Structure</hi> more uniform then our <hi>Bodies</hi> in the whole <hi>Figuration:</hi> Each side agreeing with the other, both in the number, in the quality, and in the measure of the Parts: And yet some are round, as the <hi>Arms;</hi> some flat, as the <hi>Hands;</hi> some prominent, and some more retired: So as upon the matter we see that <hi>Diversity</hi> doth not destroy <hi>Uniformity,</hi> and that the Limbs of a noble <hi>Fabrick</hi> may be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondent enough, though they be various; Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded always, that we do not run into certain extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Inventions, whereof I shall speak more largely when I come to the parting and casting of the whole <hi>Work.</hi> We ought likewise to avoyd E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous heights of six or seven <hi>Stories,</hi> as well as irregular <hi>Forms;</hi> and the contrary fault of low distended <hi>Fronts,</hi> is as unseemly: Or again, when
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102693:52"/>
the <hi>Face</hi> of the Building is narrow, and the <hi>Flank</hi> deep: To all which extreames some particular Nations or Towns are subject, whose Names may be civilly spared: And so much for the general <hi>Figuration,</hi> or <hi>Aspect</hi> of the <hi>Work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now concerning the Parts in Severalty. All the parts of every <hi>Fabrick</hi> may be comprised under five Heads, which Division I receive from <hi>Batista Alberti,</hi> to do him right. And they be these:</p>

                  <p>About all which I purpose to gather the principal Cautions, and as I pass along, I will touch also the natural Reasons of <hi>Art,</hi> that my Discourse may be the less <hi>Mechanical.</hi>

                  <p>First then concerning the <hi>Foundation,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth the exactest care; For if that happen to dance, it will mar all the mirth in the House: Therefore that we may found our Habitation firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we must first examine the <hi>Bed</hi> of <hi>Earth</hi> (as I may term it,) upon which we will Build; and then the underfillings, or <hi>substruction,</hi> as the Ancients did call it: For the former, we have a general Precept in <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> twice precisely repeated by him, as a Point indeed of main consequence; first, <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 5.

                  <p>Some <hi>Italians</hi> do prescribe, that when they have chosen the <hi>Floor,</hi> or Plot, and laid out the Limits of the <hi>Work,</hi> we should first of all Dig <hi>Wells</hi> and <hi>Cisterns,</hi> and other Under-conducts and Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, for the <hi>Suillage</hi> of the House, whence may arise a double benefit: for both the nature of the <hi>Mould</hi> or <hi>Soil;</hi> would thereby be safely searched, and moreover those open vents will serve to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge such <hi>Vapours,</hi> as having otherwise no issue, might peradventure shake the Building. This is enough for the natural Grounding; which though it be not a Part of the solid <hi>Fabrick,</hi> yet here was the fittest place to handle it.</p>

For as <hi>Philippe de l'Orme</hi> observeth, the breaking or yielding of a stone in this part, but the breadth of the back of a knife, will make a <hi>Cleft</hi> of more then half a foot in the <hi>Fabrick</hi> aloft: So important are <hi>fundamental Errors.</hi> Among which notes I have said nothing of <hi>Pallification,</hi> or <hi>Pyling</hi> of the <hi>Ground-plot,</hi> commanded by <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> when we build upon a moist or marshy <hi>Soil,</hi> because that were an errour in the first choice.

                     <hi>Pillars,</hi> which we may likewise call <hi>Columnes</hi> (for the word among Artificers is almost naturalized) I could distinguish into <hi>Simple</hi> and <hi>Compounded.</hi> But (to tread the beaten and plainest way) there are five <hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>Pillars,</hi> according to their dignity and perfection, thus marshalled.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>The <hi>Tuscan.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>The <hi>Dorique.</hi>

                  </list>
                  <p>And the <hi>Compound Order,</hi> or as some call it, the <hi>Roman,</hi> others more generally the <hi>Italian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which five <hi>Orders;</hi> I will first consider their <hi>Communities,</hi> and then their <hi>Proprieties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Communities</hi> (as far as I observe) are Principally three. First, they are all <hi>Round;</hi> for though some conceive <hi>Columna Atticurges,</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Vitruvius, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. to have been a squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Pillar, yet we must pass it over at irregular, never received among these <hi>Orders,</hi> no more then certain other licentious inventions; of <hi>Wreathed,</hi> and <hi>Vined,</hi> and <hi>Figured Columnes,</hi> which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himself condemneth, being in his whole Book a professed enemy to <hi>Fancies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, they are all <hi>Diminished</hi> or <hi>Contracted</hi> insensibly, more or less, according to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their heights, from one third part of the whose <hi>Shaft</hi> upwards, which <hi>Philander</hi> doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe by his own precise measuring of the Ancient
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102693:55"/>
remainders, as the most gracefull <hi>Diminution.</hi> And here I must take leave to blame a practice grown (I know not how) in certain places too familiar, of making <hi>Pillars</hi> swell in the middle, as if they were sick of some <hi>Tympany,</hi> or <hi>Dropsie,</hi> without any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique Pattern or Rule, to my knowledge, and unseemely to the very judgement of sight. True it is, that in <hi>Vitruvius, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. we find these words, <hi>De adjectione, quae adjicitur in mediis Columnis, quae apud Grecos</hi>

                     <hi>appellatur, in extremo libro erit formatio ejus;</hi> which passage seemeth to have given some countenance to this errour. But of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise there made, as of divers other elsewhere, our Master hath failed us, either by slip of memory, or injury of time, and so we are left in the dark. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes sure I am, that besides the authority of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample which it wanteth; it is likewise contrary to the Original and Natural <hi>Type,</hi> in <hi>Trees,</hi> which at first was imitated in <hi>Pillars,</hi> as <hi>Vitruvius</hi> himself observeth, <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. For who ever saw any <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,</hi> or <hi>Pine</hi> (which are there alledged) small be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and above, and tumerous in the middle; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it were some diseased Plant, as Nature (though otherwise the comeliest <hi>Mistress)</hi> hath now and then her deformities and <hi>Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they have all their <hi>Under-settings,</hi> or <hi>Pedistals,</hi> in height a third part of the whole <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne,</hi> comprehending the <hi>Base</hi> and <hi>Capital;</hi> and their upper Adjuncts, as <hi>Architrave, Frize,</hi> and <hi>Cornice,</hi> a fourth part of the said Pillar; which rule, of singular use and facility, I find setled by <hi>Jacobo Baroccio;</hi> and hold him a more credible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, as a man that most intended this piece, then any that vary from him in those <hi>Dimensions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:102693:55"/>
These are their most considerable <hi>Communities</hi> and agreements.</p>
                  <p>Their <hi>Proprieties</hi> or <hi>Distinctions</hi> will best appear by some reasonable description of them altogether, with their <hi>Architraves, Frizes,</hi> and <hi>Cornices,</hi> as they are usually handled.</p>
                  <p>First therefore, the <hi>Tuscan</hi> is a plain, massie, rural Pillar, resembling some sturdy well-limb'd Labourer, homely clad, in which kind of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons <hi>Vitruvius</hi> himself seemeth to take pleasure, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. The length thereof shall be six <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters,</hi> of the grossest of the Pillar below. Of all proportions, in truth, the most natural; For our Author tells us, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. that the foot of a man is the sixth part of his body in ordinary measure, and <hi>Man</hi> himself according to the saying of <hi>Prota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> (which <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth somewhere vouchsafe to celebrate) is <gap reason="foreign">

And therefore we need not consider his rank among the rest. The distance or <hi>Interco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniation</hi> (which word Artificers do usually bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row) may be near four of his own <hi>Diameters,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Materials</hi> commonly layd over this Pillar, were rather of wood then stone; through the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness whereof the <hi>Architrave</hi> could not suffer, though thinly supported, nor the <hi>Columne</hi> it self, being so substantial. The <hi>Contraction</hi> alost shall be (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the most received practice) one fourth part of his thickness below. To conclude, for I intend only as much as shall serve for a due Distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not to delineate every petty member) the <hi>Tuscan</hi> is of all the rudest Pillar, and his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Character <hi>Simplicity.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:102693:56"/>
The <hi>Dorique Order</hi> is the gravest that hath been received into civil use, preserving, in comparison of those that follow, a more <hi>Masculine Aspect,</hi> and little trimmer then the <hi>Tuscan</hi> that went before, save a sober garnishment now and then of <hi>Lions heads</hi> in the <hi>Cornice,</hi> and of <hi>Tryglyphs</hi> and <hi>Metopes</hi> alwayes in the <hi>Frize.</hi> Sometimes likewise, but rarely, channeled, and a little slight Sculpture about the <hi>Hypotrachelion</hi> or <hi>Neck,</hi> under the <hi>Capital.</hi> The length, seven <hi>Diameters.</hi> His rank or degree, is the lowest by all <hi>Congruity,</hi> as being more massie then the other three, and consequently abler to support. The <hi>Intercolumniation,</hi> thrice as much as his thickness below. The <hi>Contraction</hi> aloft, one fifth of the same measure. To discern him, will be a piece rather of good <hi>Heraldry,</hi> then of <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture:</hi> For he is best known by his place when he is in company, and by the peculiar ornament of his <hi>Frize</hi> (before mentioned) when he is alone.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ionique Order</hi> doth represent a kind of Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine slenderness, yet saith <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> not like a light House-wife, but in a decent dressing, hath much of the <hi>Matron.</hi> The length eight <hi>Diameters.</hi> In degree as in substantialness, next above the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,</hi> sustaining the third, and adorning the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Story.

                     </gap> known by his trimmings, for the body of this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne</hi> is perpetually channelled, like a thick pleigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Gown. The <hi>Capital</hi> dressed on each side, not much unlike Womens Wires, in a spiral wreath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which they call the <hi>Ionian Voluta.</hi> The <hi>Cornice</hi> indented. The <hi>Frize</hi> swelling like a pillow: And therefore by <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> not unelegantly termed <hi>Pulvinata.</hi> These are his best <hi>Characters.</hi>

The <hi>Corinthian,</hi> is a <hi>Columne</hi> lasciviously decked like a Curtezan, and therein much participating (as all Inventions do) of the place where they were first born: <hi>Corinth</hi> having been (without controversie) one of the wantonest Towns in the world. This <hi>Order</hi> is of nine <hi>Diameters.</hi> His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, one Stage above the <hi>Ionique,</hi> and alwayes the highest of the simple <hi>Orders.</hi> The <hi>Intercolumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> two of his <hi>Dia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>The last is the Compounded <hi>Order:</hi> His <hi>name</hi> being a brief of his <hi>nature.</hi> For this Pillar is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in effect, but a <hi>medly,</hi> or an <hi>amasse</hi> of all the precedent <hi>Ornaments,</hi> making a new kind, by stealth; and though the most richly tricked, yet the poorest in this, that he is a borrower of all his Beauty. His length, (that he may have somewhat of his own) shall be of ten <hi>Diameters.</hi> His degree should, no doubt, be the highest, by reasons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yielded. But few <hi>Palaces,</hi> Ancient or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, exceed the third of the Civil <hi>Orders.</hi> The

                     <hi>Intercolumniation</hi> but a <hi>Diameter</hi> and an half, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes somewhat less then two. The Contraction of this Pillar must be one eighth Part less above then below. To know him will be easie by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mixture of his <hi>Ornaments,</hi> and Clothing.</p>
                  <p>And so much touching the five <hi>Orders</hi> of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes, which I will conclude with two or three not impertinent Cautions:</p>
                  <p>First, that where more of these <hi>Orders</hi> then one, shall be set in several <hi>Stories</hi> or <hi>Contignations,</hi> there must be an exquisite care to place the <hi>Columnes</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely one over another, that so the <hi>solid</hi> may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the <hi>solid,</hi> and the <hi>vacuities</hi> to the <hi>vacuities,</hi> as well for <hi>Beauty,</hi> as strength of the <hi>Fabrick:</hi> And by this Caution the Consequence is plain, that when we speak of the <hi>Intercolumniation</hi> or <hi>Distance</hi> which is due to each <hi>Order,</hi> we mean in a <hi>Dorique, Ionical, Corinthian Porch,</hi> or <hi>Cloister,</hi> or the like of one <hi>Contignation,</hi> and not in Storied buildings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Let the <hi>Columnes</hi> above be a fourth part less then those below, saith <hi>Vitruvius, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. A strange Precept in my opinion; and to strange, that peradventure it were more sutable, even to his own Principles, to make them rather a fourth part greater. For <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. where our Master handleth the <hi>Contractions</hi> of Pillars, we have an <hi>Optique</hi> Rule, that the higher they are, the less should be alwayes their diminution aloft, because the <hi>Eye</hi> it self doth naturally contract all <hi>Objects</hi> more or less, according to the <hi>Distance;</hi> which Consideration may, at first sight, seem to have been forgotten in the Caution we have now given; but <hi>Vitruvius</hi> (the best Interpreter of himself) hath in the same place of his fifth Book well acquitted his Memory by these words: <hi>Columna superiores quarta</hi>

And yet <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. he seemeth again to affect <hi>Subtilty,</hi> allowing Pillars the more they are chaneled, to be the more slender; because while our <hi>Eye</hi> (saith he) doth as it were distinctly measure the eniment and the hollowed parts, the Total Object appeareth the bigger, and so as much as those excavations do sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, is supplied by a <hi>Fallacy</hi> of the <hi>Sight:</hi> But here me thinks, our Master should likewise have rather considered the natural inconvenience; for though Pillars by cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>neling, be seemingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossed to our Sight, yet they are truly weakened in themselves; and therefore ought perchance in sound reason not to be the more slender, but the more corpulent, unless apparences preponder truths; but <hi>Contra Magistrum non est disputan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third Caution shall be, that all the <hi>projected</hi> or <hi>jutting</hi> parts (as they are termed) be very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, especially, the <hi>Cornices</hi> of the lower <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> for whilest some think to give them a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and royal Aspect by their largeness, they sometimes hinder both the Light within, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I shall speak more in due place) and likewise detract much from the view of the <hi>Front</hi> without, as well appeareth in one of the principal Fabricks at <hi>Venice,</hi> namely, the Palace of the Duke <hi>Grimani</hi> on the <hi>Canal Grande,</hi> which by this magnificent er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, is somewhat disgraced: I need now say no more concerning <hi>Columnes</hi> and their <hi>Adjuncts,</hi> about which Architects make such a noise in their Books,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102693:58"/>
as if the very terms of <hi>Architraves,</hi> and <hi>Frizes,</hi> and <hi>Cornices,</hi> and the like, were enough to gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a Master of this <hi>Art:</hi> yet let me before I pass to other matter, prevent a familiar Objection; It will perchance be said, that all this Doctrine touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the five <hi>Orders,</hi> were fitter for the <hi>Quarries</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> which yielded 127 <hi>Columnes</hi> of 60 <hi>Foot</hi> high to the <hi>Ephesian Temple;</hi> or for <hi>Numidia,</hi> where <hi>Marbles</hi> abound; then for the <hi>Spirits</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who must be contented with more ignoble <hi>Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als:</hi> To which I answer, That this need not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us: For I have often at <hi>Venice</hi> viewed with much pleasure, an <hi>Atrium Graecum</hi> (we may tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate it an <hi>Anti porch,</hi> after the Greek manner) raised by <hi>Andraea Palladio,</hi> upon eight <hi>Columnes</hi> of the <hi>compounded Order:</hi> The <hi>Bases</hi> of Stone, without <hi>Pedistals:</hi> The <hi>Shafts</hi> or Bodies of meer Brick, three Foot and an half thick in the <hi>Diameter</hi> below, and consequently thirty five Foot high, as himself hath described them in his second Book: Then which, mine Eye hath never yet beheld any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes more stately of Stone or Marble; For the Bricks having first been formed in a <hi>circular Moula,</hi> and then cut before their burning into four Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or more, the sides afterwards joyn so closely, and the points concenter so exactly, that the <hi>Pillars</hi> appear one <hi>entire Peece;</hi> which short description<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>After <hi>Pillars,</hi> the next in my distribution are <hi>Pilasters,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Vitruvius, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and scant any where else under the name of <hi>Parastates,</hi> as <hi>Philander</hi> conceiveth, which <hi>Grammatical</hi> point (though perchance not very clear) I am content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102693:58"/>
to examine no further. Alwayes, what we mean by the thing it self is plain enough in our own vulgar; Touching which, I will briefly collect the most considerable Notes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pylasters</hi> must not be too tall and slender, lest they resemble <hi>Pillars;</hi> nor too <hi>Dwarfish</hi> and gross, lest they imitate the <hi>Piles</hi> or <hi>Peers</hi> of Bridges; Smoothness doth not so naturally become them, as a Rustick <hi>Superficies;</hi> for they aim more at <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> then <hi>Elegancy.</hi> In private Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they ought not to be narrower then one Third, nor broader then two parts of the whole Vacuity between <hi>Pylaster</hi> and <hi>Pylaster;</hi> but to those that stand at the Corners, may be allowed a little more Latitude by discretion, for strength of the <hi>Angles:</hi> In <hi>Theaters</hi> and <hi>Amphi theaters,</hi> and such weighty Works, <hi>Palladio</hi> observeth them, to have been as broad as the half, and now and then as the whole <hi>Vacuity:</hi> He noteth likewise (and others consent with him) that their true <hi>Proportion</hi> should be an exact <hi>Square;</hi> But for lestening of expence, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging of room, they are commonly narrower in <hi>Flank,</hi> then in <hi>Front:</hi> Their principal <hi>Grace</hi> doth consist in half or whole <hi>Pillars</hi>' applied unto them; in which case it is well noted by Authors, that the Columnes may be allowed somewhat above their ordinary length, because they lean unto so good <hi>Supporters.</hi> And thus much shall suffice touching <hi>Pylasters,</hi> which is a cheap, and a strong, and a noble kind of <hi>Structure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now because they are oftner, both for Beauty, and Majesty, found <hi>arched,</hi> then otherwise; I am here orderly led to speak of <hi>Arches,</hi> and under the same head of <hi>Vaults:</hi> for an <hi>Arch</hi> is nothing indeed but a contracted <hi>Vault,</hi> and a <hi>Vault</hi> is but a dilated

                     <p>Thus having considered the precedent <hi>Apertions,</hi> or <hi>Overtures</hi> in severalty, according to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Requisites, I am now come to the casting and <hi>Contexture</hi> of the whole <hi>Work,</hi> comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the term of <hi>Compartition:</hi> Into which (being the mainest piece) I cannot enter without a few general Precautions, as I have done in other Parts.</p>
                     <p>First therefore, Let no man that intendeth to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102693:64"/>
build, settle his Fancy upon a draught of the <hi>Work</hi> in <hi>paper,</hi> how exactly soever measured, or neatly set off in <hi>perspective;</hi> And much less upon a bare <hi>Plant</hi> thereof, as they call the <hi>Sciographia</hi> or <hi>Ground lines;</hi> without a <hi>Model</hi> or <hi>Type</hi> of the whole <hi>Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi> and of every parcel and Partition in <hi>Past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board</hi> or <hi>Wood.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next, that the said Model be as plain as may be, without colours, or other beautifying, lest the pleasure of the <hi>Eye</hi> preoccupate the <hi>Judgement;</hi> which advice, omitted by the <hi>Italian Architécts,</hi> I find in <hi>Philippe de l'Orme;</hi> and therefore (though <hi>France</hi> be not the <hi>Theater</hi> of best buildings) it did merit some mention of his name.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, the bigger that this <hi>Type</hi> be, it is still the better, not that I will perswade a man to such an enormity, as that <hi>Model</hi> made by <hi>Antonio Labaco,</hi> of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> containing 22 foot in length, 16 in breadth, and 13 in heighth, and costing 4184 Crowns: The price, in truth, of a reasonable Chappel: Yet in a Fabrick of some 40 or 50 thousand pounds charge, I wish 30 pounds at least laid out before hand in an exact <hi>Model;</hi> for a little misery in the <hi>Premises,</hi> may easily breed some absurdity of greater charge, in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, after these premonishments I will come to the <hi>Compartition</hi> it self, By which, the Authors of this <hi>Art</hi> (as hath been touched before) do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, a <hi>gracefull,</hi> and <hi>usefull</hi> distribution, of the whole <hi>Ground-plot,</hi> both for rooms of <hi>Office,</hi> and of <hi>Reception</hi> or <hi>Entertainment,</hi> as far as the Capacity thereof, and the nature of the Countrey will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Which circumstances in the present subject, are all of main consideration, and might yield more
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102693:64"/>
discourse then an <hi>Elemental Rapsodie</hi> will permit. Therefore (to anatomize briefly this Definition) the <hi>Gracefulness</hi> (whereof we speak) will consist in double <hi>Analogy,</hi> or correspondency. First be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Parts</hi> and the <hi>whole,</hi> whereby a <hi>great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick</hi> should have <hi>great Partitions, great Lights, great Entrances, great Pillars</hi> or <hi>Pylasters:</hi> In summe, all the <hi>Members great.</hi> The next between the <hi>Parts</hi> themselves, not only, considering their <hi>breadths,</hi> and <hi>lengths,</hi> as before when we spake of <hi>Doors</hi> and <hi>Windows;</hi> but here likewise enters a third respect of <hi>Height,</hi> a point (I must confess) hardly reducea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to any general precept.</p>
                     <p>True it is, that the <hi>Ancients</hi> did determine the <hi>Longitude</hi> of all <hi>Rooms,</hi> which were longer then broad, by the double of their <hi>Latitude, Vitruvius lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. And the <hi>Heighth</hi> by the half of the breadth and length summed together. But when the Room was precisely square, they made the <hi>Height</hi> half as much more as the <hi>Latitude;</hi> which Dimensions the Modern <hi>Architects</hi> have taken leave to vary, upon discretion: Sometimes squaring the <hi>Latitude,</hi> and then making the <hi>Diagonial</hi> or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart Line, from <hi>Angle</hi> to <hi>Angle,</hi> of the said <hi>Square;</hi> the measure of the <hi>Heighth</hi> sometimes more, but seldome lower then the full breadth it self; which boldness of quitting the old <hi>Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> some attribute first to <hi>Michael Angele da Buona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roti,</hi> perchance upon the credit he had before got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in two other Arts.</p>
                     <p>The second Point is <hi>Usefulness,</hi> which will consist in a sufficient <hi>Number</hi> of Rooms, of all sorts, and in their apt <hi>Coherence,</hi> without <hi>distraction,</hi> without <hi>confusion;</hi> so as the beholder may not only call it <hi>Una Fabrica ben raccolta,</hi> as <hi>Italians</hi> use to speak of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102693:65"/>
well united Works; but likewise, that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <hi>airy</hi> and <hi>spiritous,</hi> and fit for the welcome of chearfull Guests; about which the principal Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty will be in contriving the <hi>Lights,</hi> and <hi>Stair-cases,</hi> whereof I will touch a note or two: For the first, I observe that the ancient <hi>Architects</hi> were at much ease. For both the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> (of whose private dwellings <hi>Vitruvius</hi> hath left us some description) had commonly two <hi>cloistered</hi> open <hi>Courts,</hi> one serving for the <hi>Womens</hi> side, and the other for the <hi>Men;</hi> who yet perchance now adays would take so much separation unkindly. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever by this means, the reception of <hi>Light</hi> into the Body of the building, was very prompt, both from without and from within: which we must now supply either by some open <hi>Form</hi> of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,</hi> or among gracefull refuges, by <hi>Tarrasing</hi> any <hi>Story</hi> which is in danger of darkness; or last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by <hi>perpendicular Lights</hi> from the <hi>Roof,</hi> of all other the most natural, as shall be shewed anon. For the second Difficulty, which is casting of the <hi>Stair-cases;</hi> That being in it self no hard point, but only as they are incumbrances of room for other use, (which lights were not) I am therefore aptly moved here to speak of them. And first of Offices.</p>
                     <p>I have marked a willingness in the <hi>Italian</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans, to distribute the <hi>Kitchin, Pantry, Bakehouse, washing Rooms:</hi> and even the <hi>Buttery</hi> likewise, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground, next above the <hi>Foundation,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times level with the plain, or <hi>Floor</hi> of the <hi>Cellar:</hi> raising the first Ascent into the house Fifteen Foot, or more, for that End; which besides the benefit of removing such annoies out of sight, and the gaining of so much more room above, doth also
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102693:65"/>
by elevation of the <hi>Front</hi> adde <hi>Majesty</hi> to the whole <hi>Aspect.</hi> And with such a disposition of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal <hi>Stair-case,</hi> which commonly doth deliver us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Plain</hi> of the second <hi>Story,</hi> there may be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders done with a little room, whereof I could alledge brave <hi>Examples</hi> abroad; and none more Artificial and Delicious, then a House built by <hi>Daniele Barbaro Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned among the memorable <hi>Commenters</hi> upon <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius.</hi> But the <hi>Definition</hi> (above determined) doth call us to some consideration of our own Countrey; where though all the other petty <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> (before rehearsed) may well enough be so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, yet by the natural <hi>Hospitality</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Buttery</hi> must be more visible, and we need per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance for our <hi>Raunges,</hi> a more spacious and lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <hi>Kitchin</hi> then the foresaid Compartition will bear; with a more competent nearness likewise to the <hi>Dining-Room,</hi> or else besides other Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, perhaps some of the Dishes may straggle by the way. Here let me note a common defect, that we have of a very usefull <hi>Room,</hi> called by the <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Il Tinello;</hi> and familiar, nay almost essential, in all their great <hi>Families.</hi> It is a place properly appointed to conserve the meat that is taken from the Table, till the <hi>Waiters</hi> eat, which with us by an old fashion, is more unseemly set by in the mean while.</p>
                     <p>Now touching the distribution of <hi>Lodging-</hi>Chambers; I must here take leave to reprove a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, which I know not how, hath prevailed through <hi>Italy,</hi> though without ancient examples, as far as I can perceive by <hi>Vitruvius.</hi> The thing I mean, is, that they so cast their <hi>partitions,</hi> as when all <hi>Doors</hi> are open, a man may see through the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102693:66"/>
vvhole <hi>House,</hi> vvhich doth necessarily put an into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable servitude upon all the <hi>Chambers</hi> save the <hi>Inmost,</hi> vvhere none can arrive but through the rest; or else the <hi>Walls</hi> must be extream thick for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret passages. And yet this also vvill not serve the turn, vvithout at least <hi>Three</hi> doors to every <hi>Room:</hi> A thing most insufferable in cold and vvindy Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and every vvhere no small vveakening to the vvhole <hi>Work:</hi> Therefore vvith us that vvant no cooling, I cannot commend the direct opposition of such <hi>Overtures,</hi> being indeed meerly grounded upon the fond ambition of displaying to a <hi>Stranger</hi> all our <hi>Furniture</hi> at one <hi>Sight,</hi> vvhich therefore is most maintained by them that mean to harbour but a few; vvhereby they make only advantage of the <hi>vanity,</hi> and seldome prove the <hi>Inconvenience.</hi> There is likevvise another defect (as absurdities are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome solitary) vvhich vvill necessarily follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such a servile disposing of inward Chambers; That they must be forced to make as many common great <hi>Rooms,</hi> as there shall be several <hi>Stories;</hi> vvhich (besides that they are usually dark, a point hardly avoided, running as they do, through the middle of the vvhole <hi>House)</hi> do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise devour so much Place, that thereby they vvant other <hi>Galleries,</hi> and Rooms of <hi>Retreat,</hi> vvhich I have often considered among them (I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess) vvith no small vvonder; for I observe no <hi>Nation</hi> in the World, by nature more <hi>private</hi> and <hi>reserved,</hi> then the <hi>Italian;</hi> and on the other side, in no <hi>Habitations</hi> less <hi>privacy;</hi> so there is a kind of Conflict between their <hi>Dwelling</hi> and their <hi>Being:</hi> It might here perchance be expected, that I should at least describe (which others have done in <hi>draughts</hi> and <hi>designs)</hi> divers <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Plants</hi> and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102693:66"/>
                        <hi>Partitions,</hi> and varieties of <hi>Inventions;</hi> But specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative <hi>Writers</hi> (as I am) are not bound to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise all particular Cases vvithin the Latitude of the <hi>Subject</hi> vvhich they handle; General Lights, and <hi>Directions,</hi> and pointings at some faults, is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. The rest must be committed to the sagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Architect,</hi> vvho vvill be often put to divers ingenious shifts, vvhen he is to vvrestle vvith scarcity of <hi>Ground.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Italians</hi> call it <hi>una stanza dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata,</hi> as when a Buttery is cast under a Stair-case, or the like.</note> As sometimes * to damm one Room (though of special use) for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and beauty of all the rest; Another vvhile, to make those fairest, vvhich are most in <hi>Sight,</hi> and to leave the other (like a cunning Painter) in shadow, <hi>cum multis aliis,</hi> vvhich it vvere infinite to pursue. I vvill therefore close this part touching <hi>Compartition,</hi> as chearfully as I can, vvith a short description of a <hi>Feasting</hi> or <hi>entertaining Room,</hi> after the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> manner, vvho seem (at least till the time of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius)</hi> from the ancient <hi>Hebrews</hi> and <hi>Phoenicians</hi> (vvhence all knowledge did flow) to have retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vvith other <hi>Sciences,</hi> in a high degree, also the <hi>Principles,</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of this magnificent <hi>Art.</hi> For as far as I may conjecture by our Masters Text, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.

                     <p>Let us conceive a <hi>Floor</hi> or <hi>Area</hi> of goodly length, (for example, at least of 120 Foot, with the <hi>breadth</hi> somewhat more then the half of the <hi>Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> vvhereof the reason shall be afterwards ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. About the two longest Sides and Head of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102693:67"/>
the said <hi>Room</hi> shall run an Order of <hi>Pillars,</hi> which <hi>Palladio</hi> doth suppose <hi>Corinthian,</hi> (as I see by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign) supplying that point out of <hi>Greece,</hi> because vve know no <hi>Order</hi> proper to <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The Fourth Side I will leave free for the <hi>Entrance:</hi> On the foresaid <hi>Pillars</hi> was laid an <hi>Architrave,</hi> vvhich <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius</hi> mentioneth alone: <hi>Palladio</hi> addes thereunto (and vvith reason) both <hi>Freez</hi> and <hi>Cornice,</hi> over vvhich vvent up a continued <hi>Wall,</hi> and therein half or three quarter <hi>Pillars</hi> answering directly to the Order below, but a fourth Part less; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these half Columnes above, the vvhole Room vvas vvindowed round about.</p>
                     <p>Now, from the lowest <hi>Pillars</hi> there vvas laid over a Contignation or Floor born upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Wall,</hi> and the <hi>Head</hi> of the Columns vvith <hi>Tarrace</hi> and <hi>Pavement, Sub dio</hi> (saith our Master;) and so indeed he might safely determine the matter in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> vvhere they fear no Clouds: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Palladio,</hi> (vvho leaveth this <hi>Tarrace</hi> uncover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the middle, and <hi>ballised</hi> about) did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance construe him rightly, though therein dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording from others: Alwayes vve must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand a sufficient breadth of Pavement left between the open part and the <hi>Windows,</hi> for some delight of Spectatours, that might look down into the <hi>Room:</hi> The <hi>Latitude</hi> I have supposed, contrary to some former Positions, a little more then the half of the length; because the Pillars standing at a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent distance from the outmost <hi>Wall,</hi> vvill, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terception of the <hi>Sight,</hi> somewhat in appearance diminish the breadth; In vvhich cases, (as I have touched once or twice before) <hi>Discretion</hi> may be more licentious then <hi>Art.</hi> This is the description of an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Room for <hi>Feasts</hi> and other <hi>Iollities.</hi>
                        <pb n="47" facs="tcp:102693:67"/>
About the <hi>Walls</hi> vvhereof vve must imagine entire <hi>Statues</hi> placed below, and illuminated by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending Light from the <hi>Tarrace,</hi> as likewise from the <hi>VVindows</hi> between the half Pillars above: So as this <hi>Room</hi> had abundant and advantageous <hi>Light;</hi> and besides other garnishing, must needs receive much <hi>State</hi> by the very height of the <hi>Roof,</hi> that lay over two Orders of <hi>Columns.</hi> And so having run through the four parts of my first general <hi>Division,</hi> namely, <hi>Foundations, VValls, Apertions,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partition,</hi> the <hi>House</hi> may now have leave to put on his <hi>Hat;</hi> having hitherto been uncovered it self, and consequently unfit to cover others. Which point, though it be the last of this Art in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet it is alwayes in <hi>Intention</hi> the first: For vvho vvould build but for <hi>Shelter?</hi> Therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining both the <hi>Place,</hi> and the dignity of a <hi>Final Cause,</hi> it hath been diligently handled by divers, but by none more learnedly then <hi>Bernardino Baldi</hi> Abbot of <hi>Guastalla</hi> (before cited upon other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) vvho doth fundamentally, and <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> demonstrate the firmest <hi>Knittings</hi> of the upper <hi>Timbers,</hi> vvhich make the <hi>Roof.</hi> But it hath been rather my <hi>Scope,</hi> in these <hi>Elements,</hi> to fetch the ground of all from <hi>Nature</hi> her self, vvhich indeed is the simplest mother of Art. Therefore I will now only deliver a few of the properest, and (as I may say) of the naturallest considerations that belong to this remaining <hi>Piece.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are two Extremities to be avoided in the <hi>Cover,</hi> or <hi>Roof:</hi> That it be not too <hi>heavy,</hi> nor too <hi>light.</hi> The first, vvill suffer a vulgar objection of pressing too much the under work. The other containeth a more secret inconvenience; for the <hi>Cover</hi> is not only a bare defence, but likewise a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:102693:68"/>
kind of <hi>Band</hi> or <hi>Ligature</hi> to the vvhole <hi>Fabrick,</hi> and therefore vvould require some reasonable vveight. But of the two extreams, a House <hi>Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heavy</hi> is the vvorst. Next, there must be a care of <hi>Equality,</hi> that the <hi>Edifice</hi> be not pressed on the one side more then on the other; and here <hi>Palladio</hi> doth vvish (like a cautelous Artizan) that the inward Walls might bear some good share in the burthen, and the outward be the less charged.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Italians</hi> are very precise in giving the <hi>Cover</hi> a gracefull <hi>pendence</hi> of <hi>sloapness,</hi> dividing the vvhole breadth into nine Parts; vvhereof two shall serve for the elevation of the highest <hi>Top</hi> or <hi>Ridge</hi> from the lowest. But in this Point the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the <hi>Region</hi> is considerable: For (as our <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius</hi> insinuateth) those <hi>Climes</hi> that fear the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and lying of much <hi>Snow,</hi> ought to provide more inclining <hi>Pentices:</hi> and <hi>Comeliness</hi> must yield to <hi>Necessity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These are the usefullest Cautions vvhich I find in <hi>Authors,</hi> touching the last <hi>Head</hi> of our Division, vvherewith I vvill conclude the first Part of my present <hi>Travel.</hi> The second remaineth, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ornaments</hi> vvithin, or vvithout the <hi>Fabrick:</hi> A Piece not so dry as the meer Contemplation of Proportions. And therefore I hope therein some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to refresh both the <hi>Reader,</hi> and my self.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Sculpture</hi> likewise, the two first are absolutely necessary; The third impertinent; For <hi>Solid</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures need no elevation, by force of <hi>Lights,</hi> or <hi>shadows;</hi> Therefore in the Room of this we may put (as hath been before touched) a kind of <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,</hi> by the <hi>Italians</hi> termed <hi>Morbidezza,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Chizel,</hi> I must confess, hath more glory then the <hi>Pensil;</hi> that being so hard an <hi>Instrument,</hi> and working upon so unpliant stuff, can yet leave <hi>Strokes</hi> of so gentle <hi>appearance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fourth, which is the expressing of <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (as far as it doth depend upon the <hi>Activity</hi> and <hi>Gesture</hi> of the <hi>Figure)</hi> is as proper to the <hi>Carver,</hi> as to the <hi>Painter;</hi> though <hi>Colours,</hi> no doubt, have therein the greatest power; whereupon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, did first grow with us the <hi>Fashion</hi> of <hi>colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> even <hi>Regal Statues,</hi> which I must take leave to call an <hi>English Barbarisme.</hi>

Now in these four <hi>Requisites</hi> already rehearsed, it is strange to note, that no <hi>Artizan,</hi> having ever been blamed for excess in any of the three last; only <hi>Truth</hi> (which should seem the most <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent)</hi> hath suffered some Objection; and all <hi>Ages</hi> have yielded, some one or two <hi>Artificers</hi> so prodigiously exquisite, that they have been reputed too <hi>Natural</hi> in their <hi>Draughts;</hi> which will well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by a famous passage in <hi>Quintillian,</hi> touching the <hi>Characters</hi> of the ancient <hi>Artizans,</hi> falling now so aptly into my memory, that I must needs tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate it, as in truth it may well deserve.</p>

And so
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102693:72"/>
much touching the choice of <hi>Picture,</hi> and <hi>Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> The next is, the <hi>application</hi> of both to the <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying</hi> of <hi>Fabricks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First therefore, touching <hi>Picture,</hi> there doth occurre a very pertinent doubt, which hath been passed over too slightly, not only by some <hi>Men,</hi> but by some <hi>Nations;</hi> namely, whether this <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> can well become the <hi>Outside</hi> of <hi>houses,</hi> wherein the <hi>Germans</hi> have made so little scruple, that their best <hi>Towns</hi> are the most painted, as <hi>Augusta</hi> and <hi>Norembergh.</hi> To determine this question in a word: It is true, that a <hi>Story</hi> well set out with a good <hi>Hand,</hi> will every where take a <hi>Judicious</hi> eye: But yet withal it is as true, that various colours on the <hi>Out-walls</hi> of Buildings have alwayes in them more Delight then Dignity: Therefore I would there admit no <hi>Paintings</hi> but in <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>VVhite,</hi> nor even in that kind any <hi>Figures</hi> (if the Room be capable) under Nine or Ten foot high, which will require no ordinary <hi>Artizan;</hi> because the faults are more visible then in small <hi>Designs.</hi> In unfigured <hi>paintings</hi> the noblest is the imitation of <hi>Marbles,</hi> and of <hi>Architecture</hi> it self, as <hi>Arches, Treezes, Columns,</hi> and the like.</p>
                  <p>Now for the <hi>Inside,</hi> here grows another doubt, wherein <hi>Grotesca</hi> (as the <hi>Italians)</hi> or <hi>Antique</hi> work (as we call it) should be received; against the express authority of <hi>Vitruvius</hi> himself, <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. where <hi>Pictura</hi> (saith he) <hi>fit ejus, quod est, seu po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test esse;</hi> excluding by this severe definition, all <hi>Figures</hi> composed of different <hi>Natures</hi> or <hi>Sexes;</hi> so as a <hi>Syrene</hi> or a <hi>Centaure</hi> had been intolerable in his eye: But in this we must take leave to depart from our Master; and the rather, because he spake out of his own Profession, allowing <hi>Painters</hi> (who
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102693:73"/>
have ever been as little limited as <hi>Poets)</hi> a less scope in their imaginations, even then the gravest <hi>Philosophers,</hi> who sometimes do serve themselves of <hi>Instances</hi> that have no <hi>Existence</hi> in <hi>Nature;</hi> as we see in <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Amphisboena,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s <hi>Hirco-Cervus.</hi> And (to settle this point) what was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more common and familiar among the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves, then the <hi>Picture</hi> and <hi>Statue</hi> of <hi>Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> even one of their Deities? which yet if we well consider, is but a piece of <hi>Grotesca;</hi> I am for these reasons unwilling to impoverish that Art, though I could wish such <hi>medly</hi> and <hi>motly</hi> Designs confined only to the <hi>Ornament</hi> of <hi>Freezes,</hi> and Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, their properest place. As for other Storied <hi>VVorks</hi> upon <hi>VValls,</hi> I doubt our <hi>Clime</hi> be too yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and moist for such <hi>Garnishment;</hi> therefore leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the Dwellers discretion according to the quality of his Seat, I will only adde a Caution or two about the disposing of <hi>Pictures</hi> within.</p>
                  <p>First, That no Room be furnished with too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; which, in truth, were a Surfet of <hi>Ornament,</hi> unless they be Galleries, or some peculiar <hi>Reposito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> for Rarities of Art.</p>
                  <p>Next, that the best Pieces be placed not where there are the <hi>least,</hi> but where there are the <hi>fewest lights:</hi> therefore not only Rooms windowed on both ends, which we call through-lighted; but with two or moe windows on the same side, are enemies to this <hi>Art:</hi> and sure it is, that no Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can be seen in full perfection, but (as all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is illuminated) by a <hi>single</hi> Light.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That in the <hi>placing</hi> there be some care also taken how the <hi>Painter</hi> did stand in the <hi>working,</hi> which an intelligent <hi>Eye</hi> will easily discover; and that <hi>posture</hi> is the most natural: so as <hi>Italian</hi> Pieces
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102693:73"/>
will appear best in a Room where the Windows are high, because they are commonly made to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending Light, which of all other doth set off mens Faces in their truest spirit.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, that they be as properly bestowed for their <hi>quality,</hi> as <hi>fitly</hi> for their <hi>grace:</hi> that is, <hi>chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> Paintings in <hi>Feasting</hi> and <hi>Banqueting</hi> Rooms; <hi>Graver Stories</hi> in <hi>Galleries; Land-skips</hi> and <hi>Boscage,</hi> and such <hi>wilde</hi> works, in open <hi>Tarraces,</hi> or in <hi>Summer-houses</hi> (as wee call them) and the like.</p>
                  <p>And thus much of <hi>Picture;</hi> which let me close with this Note; that though my former Discourse may serve perchance for some reasonable <hi>leading</hi> in the choice of such delights; yet let no man hope by such a <hi>speculative</hi> erudition, to discern the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterly</hi> and <hi>mysterious</hi> touches of <hi>Art,</hi> but an Artizan himself; to whom therefore we must leave the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> to censure the manner and handling, as he himself must likewise leave some points, perchance of no less value to others; as for example, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Story</hi> be rightly <hi>represented,</hi> the <hi>Figures</hi> in true <hi>action,</hi> the <hi>persons suted</hi> to their several quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the <hi>affections proper</hi> and <hi>strong,</hi> and such like Observations.</p>
                  <p>Now for <hi>Sculpture,</hi> I must likewise begin with a Controversie, as before (falling into this Place;) or let me rather call it a very meer <hi>Fancy,</hi> strangely taken by <hi>Palladio,</hi> who having noted in an old Arch or two at <hi>Verona,</hi> some part of the <hi>Materials</hi> already cut in fine <hi>Forms,</hi> and some <hi>unpolished,</hi> doth conclude (according to his <hi>Logick)</hi> upon this particular, that the Ancients did leave the outward <hi>Face</hi> of their <hi>Marbles</hi> or <hi>Free-stone</hi> without any <hi>Sculpture,</hi> till they were laid and cemented in the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102693:74"/>
Body of the Building; For which likewise he findeth a reason, as many do now and then very wittily, even before the thing it self be true, that the Materials being left <hi>rough,</hi> were more manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the <hi>Masons</hi> hand, then if they had been <hi>smooth;</hi> And that so the <hi>sides</hi> might be laid together the more exactly; Which Conceit, once taken, he seems to have further imprinted, by marking in certain Storied <hi>Sculptures</hi> of old time, how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely the Parts and Lines of the <hi>Figures</hi> that pass from one Stone to another, do meet; which he thinks could hardly fall out so right, forgetting while he speaks of <hi>ancient</hi> things, the ancient <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> unless they had been cut after the joyning of the <hi>Materials.</hi> But all these <hi>Inducements</hi> cannot countervail the sole <hi>Inconvenience</hi> of <hi>shaking</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynting</hi> the <hi>Commissures</hi> with so many Strokes of the <hi>Chizel,</hi> besides an <hi>Incommodious</hi> Working on <hi>Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds;</hi> especially having no testimony to confirm it, that I have yet seen, among the records of <hi>Art:</hi> Nay, it is indeed rather true, that they did <hi>square,</hi> and <hi>carve,</hi> and <hi>polish</hi> their <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Marble</hi> Works, even in the very <hi>Cave</hi> of the <hi>Quarry</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was hardened by open Air: But, to leave disputation, I will set down a few <hi>Positive</hi> notes for the placing of <hi>Sculpture;</hi> because the choosing hath been handled before.</p>
                  <p>That first of all, it be not too <hi>general</hi> and <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> which would make a <hi>House</hi> look like a <hi>Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net:</hi> and in this point, <hi>moral Philosophy,</hi> which tempereth <hi>Fancies,</hi> is the <hi>Superintendent</hi> of <hi>Art.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That especially, there be a due moderation of this <hi>Ornament</hi> in the first approach; where our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors do more commend, I mean about the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102693:74"/>
                     <hi>Entrance,</hi> a <hi>Dorique,</hi> then a <hi>Corinthian</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; So as if the great <hi>Door</hi> be <hi>Arched</hi> with some brave <hi>Head,</hi> cut in fine <hi>Stone</hi> or <hi>Marble</hi> for the <hi>Key</hi> of the <hi>Arch,</hi> and two <hi>Incumbent</hi> Figures gracefully leaning upon it towards one another, as if they meant to confer, I should think this a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Entertainment for the first Reception of any <hi>judicious</hi> Sight, which I could wish seconded with two great standing <hi>Statues</hi> on each side of a paved way that shall lead up into the <hi>Fabrick,</hi> so as the Beholder at the first entrance may pass his eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Nices,</hi> if they contain <hi>Figures</hi> of <hi>white</hi> Stone or <hi>Marble,</hi> be not coloured in their <hi>Concavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> too <hi>black,</hi> For though <hi>Contraria juxta so posita ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis illucescunt</hi> (by an old Rule;) yet it hath been subtilly, and indeed truly noted, that our <hi>Sight</hi> is not well contented with those sudden departments from one extream to another: Therefore let them have rather a <hi>Duskish</hi> Tincture, then an absolute <hi>black.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That <hi>fine</hi> and delicate <hi>Sculptures</hi> be helped with <hi>Nearness,</hi> and <hi>Gross</hi> with <hi>distance;</hi> which was well seen in the old controversie between <hi>Phidias</hi> and <hi>Alcmenes</hi> about the <hi>Statue</hi> of <hi>Venus:</hi> wherein the first did shew discretion, and save labour, because the <hi>Work</hi> was to be viewed at good <hi>Height,</hi> which did drown the sweet and diligent strokes of his <hi>Adversary:</hi> A famous emulation of two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>Artizans,</hi> celebrated even by the <hi>Greek</hi> Poets.</p>
                  <p>That in the placing of standing <hi>Figures</hi> aloft, we must set them in a <hi>Posture</hi> somewhat bowing forward; because (saith our Master, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. out of a better <hi>Art</hi> then his own) the <hi>visual beam</hi>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:102693:75"/>
of our Eye, extended to the <hi>Head</hi> of the said <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,</hi> being longer then to the <hi>Foot,</hi> must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily make that <hi>part</hi> appear <hi>farther;</hi> so as to reduce it to an erect or upright <hi>position,</hi> there must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a due advantage of <hi>stooping</hi> towards us; which <hi>Albert Durer</hi> hath exactly taught in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Geometry.</hi> Our <hi>Vitruvius</hi> calleth this affection in the <hi>Eye,</hi> a <hi>resupination</hi> of the <hi>Figure:</hi> For which word (being in truth his own, for ought I know) we are almost as much beholding to him, as for the Observation it self: And let thus much summarily suffice touching the choice and use of these adorning Arts. For to speak of garnishing the <hi>Fabrick</hi> with a <hi>Row</hi> of erected <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> about the <hi>Cornice</hi> of every <hi>Contignation</hi> or <hi>Story,</hi> were discourse more proper for <hi>Athens</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time of their true greatness, when (as <hi>Pliny</hi> recordeth of his own Age) there were near as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny carved <hi>Images,</hi> as living <hi>Men;</hi> like a noble contention, even in point of <hi>Fertility,</hi> between <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Nature;</hi> which passage doth not only ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue an infinite abundance, both of <hi>Artizans</hi> and <hi>Materials;</hi> but likewise of <hi>Magnificent</hi> and <hi>Majesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Desires in every common person of those times, more or less, according to their <hi>Fortunes.</hi> And true it is indeed, that the <hi>Marble Monuments</hi> and <hi>Memories</hi> of well-deserving Men, wherewith the very High-wayes were <hi>strewed</hi> on each side, was not a bare and transitory Entertainment of the <hi>Eye,</hi> or only a gentle deception of <hi>Time</hi> to the <hi>Traveller:</hi> But had also a secret and strong <hi>Influence,</hi> even into the advancement of the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> by continual representation of vertuous Examples; so as in that points, <hi>ART</hi> became a piece of <hi>State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, as I have before subordinated <hi>Picture</hi> and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102693:75"/>
                     <hi>Sculpture</hi> to <hi>Architecture,</hi> as their Mistress; so there are certain inferiour ARTS likewise subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to them; As under Picture, <hi>Mosaique;</hi> under Sculpture, <hi>Plastique:</hi> which two I only no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, as the fittest to garnish <hi>Fabricks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mosaique;</hi> is a kind of Painting in small <hi>Pebbles, Cockles</hi> and <hi>Shels</hi> of sundry colours; and of late dayes likewise with pieces of <hi>Glass</hi> figured at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; an <hi>Ornament,</hi> in truth, of much beauty, and long life; but of most use in <hi>pavements</hi> and <hi>floorings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plastique;</hi> is not only under <hi>Sculpture,</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very <hi>Sculpture</hi> it self: but with this difference; that the <hi>Plasterer</hi> doth make his Figures by <hi>Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the <hi>Carver</hi> by <hi>Substraction;</hi> whereupon <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> was wont to say somewhat pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That <hi>Sculpture</hi> was nothing but a <hi>purgation</hi> of <hi>superfluities.</hi> For take away from a piece of wood or stone all that is <hi>superfluous,</hi> and the remainder is the intended <hi>Figure.</hi> Of this <hi>plastick Art,</hi> the chief use with us is in the graceful <hi>fretting</hi> of Rooss: But the <hi>Italians</hi> apply it to the <hi>mantling</hi> of <hi>Chimneys</hi> with great Figures. A cheap piece of <hi>Magnificence,</hi> and as durable almost within doors, as harder <hi>Forms</hi> in the weather. And here, though it be a little excursion, I cannot pass unremembred again, their manner of disguising the shafts of <hi>Chimneys</hi> in various fashions, whereof the noblest is the <hi>Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midal:</hi> being in truth a piece of Polite and Civil discretion, to convert even the <hi>conduits</hi> of foot and smoak into <hi>Ornaments;</hi> whereof I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to spoken as far as may concern the Body of the Building.</p>
                  <p>Now these are <hi>Ornaments</hi> also without, as <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Fountains, Groves, Conservatories</hi> of rare

                  <p>First, I must note a certain contrariety betvveen <hi>building</hi> and <hi>gardening:</hi> For as <hi>Fabricks</hi> should be <hi>regular,</hi> so <hi>Gardens</hi> should be <hi>irregular,</hi> or at least cast into a very vvilde <hi>Regularity.</hi> To exemplifie my conceit, I have seen a <hi>Garden,</hi> for the manner perchance incomparable, into vvhich the first Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess vvas a high vvalk like a <hi>Tarrace,</hi> from vvhence might be taken a general view of the vvhole <hi>Plot</hi> below, but rather in a delightfull confusion, then vvith any plain distinction of the pieces. From this the <hi>Beholder</hi> descending many steps, vvas after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conveyed again by several <hi>mountings</hi> and <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> to various entertainments of his <hi>sent</hi> and <hi>sight:</hi> vvhich I shall not need to describe, for that vvere poetical, let me only note this, that every one of these diversities, vvas as if he had been <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically</hi> transported into a new <hi>Garden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though other <hi>Countreys</hi> have more benefit of Sun then vve, and thereby more properly tyed to contemplate this delight; yet have I seen in our <hi>own,</hi> a delicate and diligent <hi>curiosity,</hi> surely vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>parallel</hi> among forraign <hi>Nations:</hi> Namely, in the Garden of Sir <hi>Henry Fanshaw,</hi> at his Seat in <hi>Ware-Park;</hi> vvhere I vvell remember, he did so precisely examine the <hi>tinctures</hi> and <hi>seasons</hi> of his <hi>flowers,</hi> that in their <hi>settings,</hi> the <hi>inwardest</hi> of vvhich
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102693:76"/>
that were to come up at the same time, should be alwayes a little <hi>darker</hi> then the <hi>outmost,</hi> and so serve them for a kind of gentle <hi>shadow,</hi> like a piece, not of <hi>Nature,</hi> but of <hi>Art:</hi> which mention (incident to this place) I have willingly made of his <hi>Name,</hi> for the dear <hi>friendship</hi> that was long between us: though I must confess, with much wrong to his other <hi>vertues;</hi> which deserve a more solid <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> then among these vacant Observations. So much of <hi>Gardens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fountains</hi> are <hi>figured,</hi> or only plain <hi>Water'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works:</hi> Of either of which, I will describe a match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less pattern.</p>
                  <p>The first, done by the famous hand of <hi>Michael Angelo da Buonaroti,</hi> in the figure of a sturdy <hi>woman, washing</hi> and <hi>winding</hi> of linnen clothes; in which Act, she <hi>wrings</hi> out the water that made the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;</hi> which was a graceful and natural conceit in the Artificer, implying this rule; That all <hi>designs</hi> of this kind, should be <hi>proper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other doth merit some larger expression; There went a long, straight, mossie walk of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent breadth, green, and soft under foot, listed on both sides with an <hi>Aquaeduct</hi> of white stone, brest-high, which had a hollow <hi>Channel</hi> on the top, where ran a pretty trickling stream; on the <hi>edge</hi> whereof, were couched very thick all along, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain small <hi>pipes</hi> of lead, in little holes; so neatly, that they could not be well perceived, till by the turning of a cock, they did sprout over interchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geably from side to side, above mans height, in forms of <hi>Arches,</hi> without any interfection or meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloft, because the pipes were not exactly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site; so as the <hi>Beholder,</hi> besides that which was flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the <hi>Aquaeducts</hi> on both hands in his view, did

walk, as it were, under a continual <hi>Bower</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere</hi> of water, without any drop falling on him. An <hi>Invention</hi> for refreshment, surely far excelling all the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Delicacies, and <hi>Pneumaticks</hi> of <hi>Hero.</hi>

                     <hi>Groves,</hi> and artificial Devices under ground, are of great expence, and little dignity; which for my part, I could wish converted here into those <hi>Crypteria,</hi> whereof mention is made among the curious provisions of <hi>Ticho Brahe</hi> the <hi>Danish Ptolomy,</hi> as I may well call him: which were deep <hi>concaves</hi> in Gardens, where the <hi>Stars</hi> might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served even at <hi>noon.</hi> For (by the way) to think that the brightness of the Suns body above, doth drown our discerning of the lesser lights, is a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular errour; the sole impediment being that lustre, which by <hi>reflection,</hi> doth spread about us from the face of the Earth; so as the <hi>caves</hi> before touched, may well conduce, not to a delicious, but to a learned pleasure.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Aviaries</hi> of Wire, to keep Birds of all sorts, the <hi>Italians</hi> (though no wasteful Nation) do in some places bestow vast expence; including great scope of <hi>ground,</hi> variety of <hi>bushes, trees</hi> of good height, running <hi>waters,</hi> and sometime a <hi>Stove</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, to contemper the <hi>Air</hi> in Winter. So as those <hi>Chanteresses,</hi> unless they be such as perhaps delight as much in their wing, as in their voice, may live long among so good provisions, and room, before they know that they are <hi>prisoners;</hi> reducing often to my memory that conceit of the <hi>Roman Stoick,</hi> who in comparison of his own free <hi>contemplations,</hi> did think divers great and splendent fortunes of his time, little more then <hi>commodious captivities.</hi>

Concerning <hi>Ponds</hi> of pleasure near the habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I will refer my self to a grave <hi>Author</hi> of our own (though more illustrious by his other † work) namely, <hi>Sarisburiensis</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">De nugis Curial, &amp;c.</note>

                  <p>And here I will end the second part touching <hi>Ornaments,</hi> both <hi>within,</hi> and <hi>without</hi> the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, as almost all those which have delivered the <hi>Elements</hi> of <hi>Logick,</hi> do usually conclude with a Chapter touching <hi>Method:</hi> so I am here seized with a kind of critical spirit, and desirous to shut up these building <hi>Elements</hi> with some <hi>Methodical</hi> direction how to <hi>censure</hi> Fabricks already raised: for indeed, without some way to contract our <hi>Judgement,</hi> which among so many particulars, would be lost by diffusion. I should think it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most harder to be a good <hi>Censurer,</hi> then a good <hi>Architect:</hi> Because the <hi>working</hi> part may be helped with <hi>Deliberation,</hi> but the <hi>Judging</hi> must flow from an <hi>extemporal habit.</hi> Therefore (not to leave this last <hi>Piece</hi> without some <hi>Light)</hi> I could with him that cometh to examine any nobler <hi>Work,</hi> first of all to examine himself, whether perchance the <hi>sight</hi> of many brave things before (which remain like impressed forms) have not made him apt to think nothing <hi>good</hi> but that vvhich is the <hi>best;</hi> for this <hi>humour</hi> vvere too sowre. Next, before he come to settle any imaginable opinion, let him by all means seek to inform himself precisely, of the Age of the <hi>Work</hi> upon vvhich he must pass his <hi>Doom,</hi> And if he shall find the apparent <hi>Decayes</hi> to exceed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of <hi>Time;</hi> then let him conclude vvichout father inquisition, as an absolute Decree, that either the <hi>Materials</hi> vvere too <hi>slight,</hi> or the Seat is nought. Now, after these premisses, if the <hi>House</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:102693:78"/>
be found to beat his <hi>years</hi> vvell, (vvhich is alwayes a token of sound <hi>constitution)</hi> Then let him sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run backwards, (for the <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>censuring</hi> is contrary to the <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>composing)</hi> from the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments</hi> (vvhich first allure the <hi>Eye)</hi> to the more essential <hi>Members,</hi> till at last he be able to form this <hi>Conclusion,</hi> that the <hi>Work</hi> is <hi>Commodious, Firm,</hi> and <hi>Delightfull;</hi> vvhich (as I said in the beginning) are the three capital <hi>Conditions</hi> required in good <hi>Buildings,</hi> by all <hi>Authors,</hi> both Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern. And this is, as I may term it, the most <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entifical</hi> vvay of <hi>Censuring.</hi> There are two other vvhich I must not forget: The first in <hi>Georgio Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sari,</hi> before his laborious <hi>Work</hi> of the lives of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitects,</hi> vvhich is to pass a running examination over the vvhole <hi>Edifice,</hi> according to the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a <hi>well shapen Man.</hi> As vvhether the <hi>Walls</hi> stand upright upon clean footing and <hi>Foundation;</hi> vvhether the <hi>Fabrick</hi> be of a beautiful <hi>Stature;</hi> vvhether for the <hi>breadth</hi> it appear vvell <hi>burnished;</hi> vvhether the principal <hi>Entrance</hi> be on the middle Line of the <hi>Front</hi> or <hi>Face,</hi> like our <hi>Mouths;</hi> vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Windows,</hi> as our <hi>Eyes,</hi> be set in equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and distance on both sides; vvhether the <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> like the <hi>Veins</hi> in our Bodies, be usefully distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, and so forth. For this <hi>Allegorical</hi> review may be driven as far as any <hi>Wit</hi> vvill, that is at leasure.</p>

For if any shall think <hi>Education</hi> (because it is conversant about Children) to be but a private and domestick duty; He vvill run some danger, in my opinion, to have been ignorantly bred himself. Certain it is, that anciently the best composed Estates did commit this care more to the Magistrate then to the Parent. And certain likewise, That the best Authors have
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102693:83"/>
chosen rather to handle it in their Politicks, then in their Oeconomicks. As both Writers and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers vvell knowing vvhat a stream and influence i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So great indeed, and so diffusive, that albeit good Laws have been reputed alwayes the Nerves or Ligaments of humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Yet are they (be it spoken vvith the peace of those grave Professors) no vvay comparable in their effects to the rules of good Nurture: For it is in civil, as it is in natural Plantations, vvhere young tender trees (though subject to the injuries of Air, and in danger even of their own Flexibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) vvould yet little vvant any after-underprop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings and shoarings, if they vvere at first vvell fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the root.</p>
                  <p>Now my present labour vvill (as I foresee) consist of these pieces.</p>
                  <p>First, there must proceed a vvay how to discern the Natural Capacities and inclinations of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Next must ensue the culture and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the Mind.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the moulding of behaviour, and decent forms.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the tempering of affections.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the quickning and exciting of Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and practical Judgement.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, And the last in Order, but the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal in Value, being that vvhich must knit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solidate all the rest, is the timely instilling of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious Principles and seeds of Religion.</p>
                  <p>These six branches vvill, as I conceive, embrace the vvhole business: through vvhich I shall run in as many several Chapters or Sections: But before I lanch from the shoars, let me resolve a main
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102693:83"/>
question vvhich may be cast in my vvay; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be indeed such an infallible efficacy, as I suppose, in the care of Nurture and first Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; For if that supposal should fail us, all our Anchorage vvere loose, and vve should but vvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a vvilde Sea.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plutarch,</hi> I remember to the same purpose, in the first of his Tractates, vvhich place this subject vvell deserved, endeavoureth by sundry similitudes, vvhere in that man had a prompt and luxurious fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to shew us the force of Education; All vvhich, in sooth, might have been vvell forborn, had he but known vvhat our own Countrey-men have of late time disclosed among their Magnetical Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. There they tell us, that a rod or bar of iron having stood long in a window, or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, being thence taken, and by the help of a cork or the like thing, being ballanced in water, or in any other liquid substance where it may have a free mobility, will bewray a kind of unquietude and discontentment till it attain the former positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now it is pretty to note, how in this Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Theorem</hi> is involved a Moral conclusion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect moment to the point we have in hand.</p>
                  <p>For if such an unpliant and stubborn mineral as Iron is above any other, will acquire by meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance a secret appetite, and (as I may term it) an habitual inclination to the site it held before. Then how much more may we hope, through the very same means, <hi>(Education</hi> being nothing else but a constant plight and <hi>Inurement)</hi> to induce by custome good habits into a reasonable creature? And so having a little smooth'd my passage, I may now go on to the <hi>Chapters.</hi>

Now this peradventure at the first view, may seem in Children a very slight and obvious enquiry; That age being so open and so free, and yet void of all Art to disguise or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble either their appetites, or their defects: Notwithstanding, we see it every day, and every where subject to much error; Partly by a very

                     </gap>nteressed persons, are yet, I know not how, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly inclined to a favourable conceit of little ones: so cheap a thing it is to bestow nothing but Hope. There is likewise on the other side, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten failing by an Undervaluation; for in divers Children their ingenerate and seminal powers (as I may term them) lie deep, and are of slow disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; no otherwise then in certain Vegetables, which are long before they shoot up and appear, and yet afterwards both of good and great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease; which may serve to excite care, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent despair in Parents: for if their Child be not such a speedy spreader and brancher, like the Vine, yet perchance he may prove <hi>proles tarde crescentis Olivae;</hi> and yield, though with a little longer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, as useful, and more sober fruit then the other. And, I must confess, I take some delight in these kind of comparisons; remembring well what I have often heard my truly Noble, and most dear Nephew, Sir <hi>Edmund Bacon,</hi> say, out of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite Contemplations, and Philosophical Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: That Nature surely (if she be well studied) is the best <hi>Moralist,</hi> and hath much good Counsel hidden in her bosome.</p>
                  <p>Now here then will lie the whole business, to set down before-hand certain Signatures of Hopeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or <hi>Characters,</hi> (as I will rather call them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that Word hath gotten already some enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment among us) whereby may be timely descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what the Child will prove in probability. These
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102693:85"/>
                     <hi>Characters</hi> must necessarily be either impressed in the outward person, like stamps of Nature, or must otherwise be taken from some emergent act of his mind; wherein of the former sort.</p>
                  <p>The first is that which first incurreth into sight; namely, the Child's colour or complexion, (as we vulgarily term it) and thence perchance some judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the predominant humour.</p>
                  <p>The next is the structure, and conformation of the limbs.</p>
                  <p>And the third is a certain spirituous resultance from the other two, which makes the countenance.</p>
                  <p>The second kind of these <hi>Characters</hi> (which are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mental then personal) be of such variety (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause minds are more active then bodies) that I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, for the plainest delivery, to resolve all my ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings touching both kinds, iuto a <hi>Rapsody</hi> of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Observations: For I dare not give them the Authoritative Title of <hi>Aphorisms;</hi> which yet, when I shall have mustered them, if their own strength be considered rather in troop then singly, as they say, by Pole, may perchance make a reasonable Mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>THere are in the course of humane life, from our Cradles upward, certain Periods, or Degrees of change, commonly (as the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents have noted) every seven years, whereof the two first <hi>Septynaries,</hi> and half of the third, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, I will call the Obsequious age, apt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe all manner of impressions: which time of the suppleness of Obedience is to be plied by Parents,

                     <p>There is no Complexion, or Composition in Children, either priviledged from bad proof, or prejudiced from good. Always I except prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Forms, and meer natural Impotencies, which are unmanageable <hi>In toto Genere,</hi> and no more to be cultivated then the sands of <hi>Arabia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>More ordinary Imperfections and Distortions of the Body in Figure, are so far from excluding all hope, that we usually see them attended with some notable Compensation one way or other, whereof our own time hath produced with us no slight Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in a great Minister of State, and many other.</p>
                     <p>I am yet willing to grant, that generally in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the best outward <hi>shapes</hi> are also the likeliest to be consociated with good inward <hi>faculties:</hi> for this Conclusion hath somewhat from the <hi>Divine Light:</hi> since God himself made this great <hi>World</hi> (whereof <hi>Man</hi> is the little <hi>Model)</hi> of such Harmonious Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all the parts, to be the Receptacle of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest Creature.</p>

                     <p>In the outvvard frame and fabrick of the Body, vvhich is the next object after Complexion.

                     <p>The Head in a Child I vvish great and round, vvhich is the capablest Figure, and the freest from all restraint and compreshon of the parts: For since in the Section of Bodies, vve find Man, of all sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures, to have the fullest Brain to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and that it vvas so provided by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme

Wisdom, for the lodging of the intellective Faculties: It must needs be a silent Character of Hope, vvhen, in the <hi>Oeconomical</hi> Providence of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (as I may term it) there is good store of room<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and receipt vvhere those povvers are stovved: As commonly vve may think Husbanding men to foresee their ovvn Plenty, vvho prepare before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand large Barns and Garnaries. Yet <hi>Thucidides</hi> (anciently one of the excellentest Wits in the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edst part of the World) seems (if <hi>Marcellinus</hi> in his life have vvell described him) to have been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhat Taper-headed, as many of the <hi>Genouesers</hi> are at this day in common Observation, vvho yet be a People of singular Sagacity: yea, I call not imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently to mind, that one of my time in <hi>Venice,</hi> had Wit enough to become the Civil Head of that grave <hi>Republick,</hi> vvho yet for the littleness of his own natural Head, vvas sirnamed <hi>Il Donato Testo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina.</hi> But the Obtrusion of such particular Instances as these, are unsufficient to disauthorize a Note grounded upon the final intention of Nature.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Eye</hi> in Children (vvhich commonly let them rovvl at pleasure) is of curious observation, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in point of discovery: For it loveth, or hateth, before vve can discern the heart; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth, or denieth, before the tongue; it resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or runeth avvay before the feet: nay, vve shall often mark in it a dulness, or apprehensiveness, even before the understanding.

                        </gap> some credit</p>
                     <p>We have another, somewhat of the same mould
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102693:87"/>
from <hi>Quintilian,</hi> (whom I have ever thought, since any use of my poor judgement, both the elegantest and soundest of all the <hi>Roman Pens)</hi> That a Child will have <hi>Tantum ingenii, quantum memoriae:</hi> This, I must confess, will bear a stronger Consequence of Hope; for Memory is not only considerable as it is in it self a good Retention, but likewise as it is an infallible Argument of good Attention; a point of no small value in that Age, which a fair Orange, or a red Apple will divert.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another in the same Writer, and in the same place, where he handleth this very <hi>Theam.</hi> How to descry Capacities: That Parents should mark, whether their Children be naturally apt to imitate; wherewith certainly all fine fancies are caught, and some little less then ravished. And we have a Tradition of <hi>Quintilian</hi> himself, that when he saw any well-expressed Image of grief, either in <hi>Picture,</hi> or <hi>Sculpture,</hi> he would usually weep: For, being a Teacher of Oratory in School, he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps affected with a passionate Piece of <hi>Art,</hi> as with a kind of <hi>mute Eloquence.</hi> True it is indeed, which a great Master hath long before taught <note place="margin">Aristotle in Rhetoricis.</note> us, That Man is of all Creatures the most Mimical, as a kind of near adjunct to Reason: Arguing necessarily in those that can do it well, vvhether it be in <hi>Gestures,</hi> in <hi>Styles,</hi> in <hi>Speech,</hi> in <hi>Fashion,</hi> in <hi>Accents,</hi> or hovvsoever, no shallovv Impression of Similitudes and Differences; about vvhich, in effect, is conversant the vvhole Wisdom of the World.</p>
                     <p>Besides these, I vvould vvish Parents to mark heedfully the vvitty Excuses of their Children, especially at Suddains and Surprizals; but rather to mark then pamper them, for that vvere other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102693:88"/>
to cherish untruth: vvhereof I shall speak more in the <hi>Final Section.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again are to be observed not only his ovvn craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and pertinent Evasions, but likevvise with what kind of Jests, or pleasant Accidents he is most taken in others; vvhich vvill discover the very degree of his apprehension, and even reach as far as to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring of the vvhole Nations, vvhether they be flat and dull, or of quick capacity: For surely, vve have argument enough at this day to conclude, the Ancient <hi>Grecians</hi> an Ingenious People; of vvhom the Vulgar sort, such as vvere haunters of <hi>Theaters,</hi> took pleasure in the Conceits of <hi>Aristophanes;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving my judgement to other place upon the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Obscenities of that and other Authors, vvell arguing among Christians, vvhen all is said, that the Devil is one of the vvittiest.</p>
                     <p>Again, it shall be sit to note, hovv prettily the Child himself doth manage his pretty pastimes: This may vvell become an ordinary Parent, to vvhich so great an Emperor as <hi>Augustus</hi> descended in the highest of his State, and gravest of his Age, vvho collected (as <hi>Suetonius</hi> tells us) out of all the knovvn World, especially from the <hi>Syrians</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> (where, by the way, we may note, who were then reputed the sharpest Nations) little Boys of the rarest Festivity, to play before him at their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Sports. And indeed there is much to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, worthy of a sadder judgement in the Wiliness of that Age.</p>
                     <p>Again, I would have noted in Children, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Articulate Answers, but likewise certain smiles and frowns upon incident Occasions; which though they be dumb and light passions, will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover much of that inward power which moveth
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102693:88"/>
them; especially when withal they lighten or cloud the whole face in a moment.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, let not his very Dreams be neglected; for, without question, there is a great <hi>Analogy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those Apprehensions which he hath taken by day into his Fancy, and his nocturnal Impressions; particularly in that Age, which is not yet troubled with the fumes and cares of the World; so as the Soul hath a freer and more defecated Operation: And this is enough for the disclosing of a good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity in the popular way which I have followed, because the Subject is general.</p>
                     <p>Now for the second Part of this Chapter, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inclinations: for after we know how far a Child is capable, the next will be to know unto what course he is naturally most inclined. There must go before a main research, whether the Child that I am to manage, be of a good nature or no; as the same term is vulgarly taken, for an ingenious and tractable disposition: which being a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Point, and the first root of all virtuous Actions, and though round about in every Mothers mouth, yet a thing which will need very nice and narrow Observation: I have spent some diligence in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting certain private Notes, which may direct this Inquiry.</p>
                     <p>First, therefore, when I mark in Children much solitude and silence, I like it not, nor any thing born before his time, as this must needs be in that sociable and exposed Age, as they are for the most part. When either alone, or in company, they sit still without doing of any thing, I like it worse; for surely all dispositions to Idleness, or Vacancy, even before they grow habits, are dangerous: and there is commonly but a little distance in time between doing of nothing, and doing of ill.</p>

                     <p>ARchimedes <hi>the great Engineer (who in defending</hi> Syracusa <hi>against</hi> Marcellus, <hi>shewed wonderful Experiments of his extraordinary skil,) was bold to say,</hi> That he would remove the world out of his place, if he had elsewhere to set his foot. <hi>And truly I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve so far, that otherwise he could not do it: I am sure, so much is evident in the Architecture of Fortunes; in the raising of which the best Art or endeavour is able to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if it have not where to lay the first stone; for it is possible with the like Skil to raise a frame when we have matter; but not to create something out of nothing: the first being the ordinary effect of industry, this only of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power. Indeed, many from very mean beginnings have aspired to very eminent place, and we usually ascribe it to their own worth, which no doubt in some is great; yet as in Religion we are bound to believe, so in truth the best of them will confess, that the first advantage was reached out meerly by a Divine hand, which also no doubt, did alwayes assist their after endeavours. Some have the felicity to be born heirs to good Estates, others to be made so beyond their hopes. Marriage (besides the good which oftentimes it confers directly) collaterally sometimes helps to Offices, sometimes to Benefices, sometimes to Dignities. Many rise by relation and dependance, it being a happy step to some, to have fallen on a fortunate Master, to some on a foolish, to some (few) on a good. There are divers other means, of which, as of these, I am not so fit to speak, but truly considered, they are all out of our own power, which he that presumeth most, cannot promise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and he that expects least, sometimes attains.</hi>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102693:96"/>
suppressed in great part the former Customes and Laws, and introduced new Behaviours and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits; which under shew of Civility, were in effect but Rudiments of Subjection. Lastly, he was near the Imposing, and (as I may term it) the Naturallizing here of his own <hi>Language:</hi> At least, he both made it and left it Currant in all Courts of <hi>Plea;</hi> whereof is yet remaining no small Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.</p>
                     <p>Besides his Atchievements by Force, I note a great Secret of State silently wrapped in his high Tenures of Knight Service. For, those drawing as well Marriage as Wardship, gave him both pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and occasion to Conjugate at pleasure the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and the <hi>Saxon</hi> Houses, which by degrees might prove a second Conquest of Affections, harder then the first.</p>

And for any Right or merit in the Cause, no difference but this: That either the One must keep a Kingdome ill got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or the Other get it as ill.</p>
                     <p>What were the main Errors, and what principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave the Day, so long after, is hard to affirm. Well we may conclude, that on either side the Fight was constant and fierce: and surely undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable without the death, at least, of one of the Chiefs.

to the Head-City; when Terror would have swept the ground before him: but Casting about (for so the most have delivered) more like a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress then a pursuit, as if one single Battel had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him leave to play with his Fortune, may seem strange, according to the Maximes of War at this Day: But, let all Discourse cease.

                     </p>
                     <p>In his farther Proceedings I note him sometimes most helped, and another while most hindred by the Clergy, then of mighty perswasion with the Temporal Lords and People: which taught him afterwards a Lesson when he was fast in the Throne, how to Rivet his own Greatness, by Changing the Natives into <hi>Normans,</hi> or other Aliens of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per choice, in the Highest Ecclesiastical Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</p>
                     <p>Then was <hi>Stigand</hi> the Metropolitan, in a Synod formally and fairly Deposed, being too stiff for the times: Which was indeed the wringing Point, though other Objections made more noise.</p>
                     <p>He was Crowned on <hi>Christmas</hi> Day, in the year of our Saviour 1066. At which Time he would fain have Compounded a Civil Title of, I know not what, Alliance or Adoption, or rather Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor: As if Hereditary Kingdomes did pass like New-years gifts: The truth is, He vvas the Heir of his Sword. Yet from those Pretences howsoever, there sprang this good, That he vvas thereby in a sort engaged to cast his Government into a middle or mixed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it vvere between a lawful Successor, and an invader; though generally, (as all new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires do savour much of their beginnings) it had
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102693:97"/>
more of the Violent then of the Legal.</p>
                     <p>One of the first Things in his Intent, but in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect one of the last, was the perfecting of that which we call the <hi>Winchester</hi> Book: being a more particular inquisition then had been before, of every Hide of Land within the precincts of his Conquest, and how they were holden: whence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth we may account a full Re-settlement of Lordship and propriety through the Realm. <hi>Quere</hi> (for I find it obscure) whether Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the most part, had not remained all the while before, in a kind of Martial Disposure, or perchance little better.</p>
                     <p>We have at this day more knowledge of whom he doubted, then of whom he trusted, (which I believe were very few) Certainly, his Reign must needs be full of strong apprehensions, and his nature was prone enough to entertain them, as may well appear by the event, in two Personages of all other the likeliest to sit fast about him; namely, <hi>Fitz Aubert, alias Fitz Osbern,</hi> (for he is diversly termed) and <hi>Odo,</hi> one of his own bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the same womb. These two had each of them contributed towards his Enterprize about forty ships a piece, and were the first foundation of his Fortunes, both in Strength, and in Example. But what became of them? Marry, after they had been dignified here with Earldomes, the one of <hi>Hereford,</hi> the other of <hi>Kent; Fitz Osbern</hi> (as some report) was executed under him: Or (as the most) was discarded into a Forraign Service, for a pretty shadow of Exilement. And <hi>Odo</hi> his Brother was a Prisoner even at the time of his own death: So heavy with some high minds is an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weight of Obligation: Or otherwise, great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102693:98"/>
do perchance grow intolerable Presumers Or lastly, Those that help to Raise, stand ever in some hazard to be thought likewise the fittest to Depress. I have been sometimes tempted to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how among these Jealousies of State and Court, <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> could subsist, being then the Apparent and Indubitate Heir of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Line. But he had tryed and found him a Prince of limber vertues: So as though he might per adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have some Place in his Caution, yet he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned Him beneath his Fear.</p>
                     <p>He was contemporal with three Popes, <hi>Victor,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> the second of that Name, and <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand, alias, Gregory</hi> the Seventh. <hi>Victor</hi> took the first hold of him, by Ratifying his Nuptial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract within the Degrees forbidden (which is none of the least Arts in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hierarchy, for the Chaining of Princes and their Issue to a perpetual Dependance.) <hi>Alexander</hi> drave it somewhat fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by lending his Banner to this Invasion: As they have been alwayes frank of their Blessings to Countenance any Great action: and then (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it should prosper) to Tissue upon it some Pretence or other. As, here first of all came in a Challenge of Homage, forsooth, by Promise: which though the Conqueror ever eagerly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowed; Yet, I know not how, by the cunning Incroachments of <hi>Hildebrand</hi> (that famous Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) who succeeded, He did abase and avale the Soveraignty into more Servitude towards that See, (as our Authors charge his Time) then had been since the name of a State or a Church among us.</p>

Contexture: His Limbs rather sturdy then dainty: Sublime and almost Tumorous in His Looks and Gestures: yea, even in His Oaths; for they say, He used to swear <hi>By the Resurrection of the Son of God.</hi> By nature far from Profusion, and yet a greater Sparer then a Saver; For though he had such means to accumulate, yet His Forts, Castles, and Towers which he built, and his Garrisons which he maintained, and his Feastings (wherein he was only Sumptuous) could not but soak His Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. Besides, the multiplicity of Rewards which hang upon such Acquests; And likewise cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain secret waste Pipes of <hi>Espials</hi> through the Realm, no less chargeable, then Necessary for new Beginners. But above all, I must note the Popes Legats and Dreyners, which began here to be frequent in His Time; and are no where cheap.</p>
                     <p>One strange and excellent Fame doth follow Him: That the Land had never been before so free from Robberies and Depredations, as through His Reign; scarce Credible in such a Broken and Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Time, if it were not so constanly delivered. But, it should seem, That to ingratiate himself with the vulgar (with whom there is nothing more popular then Security) He made it a Master-piece of his Regiment. And perchance Action had pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well evacuated the idle people; which are the stock of Rapine.</p>
                     <p>His Wife, the Lady <hi>Magdalena,</hi> brought him four Sons, and six Daughters; And (besides her natural Fertility) we may almost account her pregnant of a Conquest: For, her Father Earl <hi>Baldwin</hi> of <hi>Flanders</hi> had then the <hi>French</hi> King in Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telage: So as (no doubt) by her Mediation he
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102693:99"/>
drew a great Concurrence from that Kingdome, and the adjacent Provinces. For these Reasons He loved Her well: And I find his life little tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with extravagant Lust; for, his pleasures were more of the Field, then of the Chamber. Yet, he had one Illegitimate Child (to keep it in fashion) namely, <hi>Pruerel,</hi> Lord of <hi>Nottingham</hi> and <hi>Derby.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He left the Succession to his second Son, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he bare his Name (though that perhaps might have been some Motive:) nor because he thought him the best timbred to support it: But <hi>Robert</hi> his eldest, having openly Rebelled against him; and having (as they write) at a casual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter given him his Life (which was too great a Gift to be either forgotten or acknowledged) he had reason to prefer the more obsequious Child. And I think, we shall need to seek no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Henry</hi> his third Son, albeit he was born after his Father was a King; and the two former were but the Issue of a Duke of <hi>Normandy;</hi> so as by some ancient Examples (if Examples could car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Diadems) he might, and perchance did expect the Crown; yet, He left Him (by our best Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations) but a bare Legacy of five thousand pounds. Note the sober measure of that Age, when it was a Kings younger Sons Portion, which is now scant an Aldermans: So much is either Wealth increased, or Moderation decayed.</p>
                     <p>But let me Conclude my Notes upon the Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Champion. He died not in his Acquisitive, but in his Native Soil: Nature her self as it vvere claiming a final Interest in his body, vvhen For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had done vvith Him. But one thing fell out
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102693:99"/>
to disquiet his Obsequies, That the Place vvhere he should be laid, vvas put in Suit, as having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in the Time of his Power been vvrested from the true Owner; vvhich a vvhile suspended his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment, and became a Declamatory Theam among the Religious Men of that Age; That so Great A Conquerour of Forraign Lands should at length vvant Earth at Home to cover Him.</p>
                     <p>But it vvas the last of his vvorldly Felicities, that for the better Establishment of His Heir, he survived his own Victory twenty Years, eight Moneths, and sixteen dayes. For, <hi>Tempus conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit omnia.</hi>

Which sacred customes Emulation in some sort, having transported me, and dispell'd
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102693:115"/>
the chilness from my brest, which the weight of age hath introduced, I shall with flagrant confidence betake my self to celebrate this Day, whereon your Majesty doth restore your Self to us, and us unto our selves. So far indeed am I from being discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the weakness of my own elocution, that I am even ready to esteem my self thereby the abler. For, what need is here of dressings Rhetorical? Wherefore over sollicitously ballance the weight of words? Susfice it this day simply to rejoyce. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity is a plain and impolite thing, the less trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the more chearful; and Eloquence while it adorneth, corrupteth our gladness. Nor is it my fear, that this shall seem a flatterers act, (as it were) ambitiously prostrate at Fortunes feet, which in truth were unworthy of that ingenuous modesty, derived from my <hi>Parents,</hi> unbefitting that blessed Rest of mind I drew from liberal Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Yet doth one solitude at the very entrance, I confess, surround me, lest (namely) even with true <hi>praises</hi> I offend that modesty, wherewith Your Majesty useth so sweetly to season your other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: for whereas you are most stout in all things else, that requires Validity of Body, or Constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Mind, I only doubt, lest you should beat this dayes Applauses and Elogies, by so much the more tenderly, by how much they are the more justly due.</p>
                  <p>We read that <hi>Germanicus</hi> (and yet how great a Personage!) not long before the <hi>battel</hi> against the <hi>Chatti;</hi> did under the disguise of a beasts skin, (that he might not be observed) by night, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach his souldiers tents, to catch up by dark what they conceived of him. <hi>So do those commonly with most tenderness admit their own commendations, who most deserve them.</hi>

                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:102693:115"/>
Whence I sufficiently foresee the necessity of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring my access to your <hi>Sacred Ears,</hi> not by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments drawn from the slight Magazines of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, but by others of a soberer sort. I shall therefore affirm it most equitable, that neither the gallant, nor the baser lives of Princes be pressed down in ignoble silence. But that both good and bad be transmitted equally to the knowledge of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, in a like freedome of writing, as living: and with no less reverence of Truth, then of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty. Those, least vertuous examples failing, Vertues themselves by degrees decay: These, that evading the power of Laws, yet may be bridled through some awe of Record. This to you, I may dare to speak (my most Gracious Master) and even that I may dare, I owe to your self alone, who now have so lived 33 years, and so reigned near to nine, That you dread not truth.</p>
                  <p>Most famous was of old, and will live for ever, that answer of <hi>Virginius Rufus,</hi> to <hi>Cluvius: You know, Virginius</hi> (saith he) <hi>what credit is due to Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story: wherefore if you read any thing in my books, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then you would have it, pardon me.</hi> To whom <hi>Virginius, Thou canst not</hi> (Cluvius) <hi>be ignorant of this, That therefore I did what I have done, that it might be free for you to write what you pleased.</hi> This was indeed the confidence of a gallant, but yet of a private man.</p>
                  <p>How much more eminent may the joy be of this day, for a King returned, of whose Life and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals we may speak both openly and safely. Yea, let me adde this with confidence, that if Nature her self (the first Architectress) had (to use an expression of <hi>Vitruvius) windowed</hi> your brest: if your Majesty should admit the eyes of all men,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102693:116"/>
not only within the privatest parts of your Bed-Chamber, but even into the inwardest closets of your heart: no other thing at all would there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, save the splendor of your Goodness, and an undistemper'd serenity of your Vertues. What said I? if you would admit? As if those whom the Supreme Power hath set on high, and in the light, could be hid from our eyes? or cover, as it were by a drawn cloud, the wayes of their Lives and Government? Herein, no doubt, Obscurity and Solitude it self, is more vailed then Majesty. Thinks that <hi>Abissine</hi> Emperor (whom men report to appear to publick view but once a year) that therefore it is less known what he doth in secret? Know we not at this day, that <hi>Domitian</hi> even in his closest Cabinet, wherein each day he shut up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, did nothing but stick flyes with a pointed Bodkin? Lay <hi>Tiberius</hi> hid in his recess to the Islands of <hi>Caprea,</hi> when among so many wounds and tortures of his conscience (which as so many furies tormented him) many tokens of a distracted mind did daily break forth? Surely no.</p>
                  <p>Your Majesty hath taught the Princes of your own, and future times, the only and most whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some way of self-concealing, in that you indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour nothing to be concealed. There are certain creatures of ingrateful aspect, as <hi>Bats</hi> and <hi>Owls,</hi> condemn'd by nature to hate the light. I know al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that some in power have also held it among the secrets of State, and as a great mystery of craft, to be served at a distance: as if reverence did only dwell in Dens, and Caves; not in the light. Whence then these Subtilties of Government? In a word, and freely; they walked in crooked paths, because they knew not (the shortest way)
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102693:116"/>
to be good. But, your Majesty doth not shun the eyes and access of your Subjects, delight not in covert; nor withdraw your self from your own people: you do not catch at false veneration with a rigid and clouded countenance; yea, sometime you vouchsafe to descend even to some familiarity without offence to your dignity: for thus you rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with your self in the clearness of your own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some; <hi>If it were not above our power to lye concealed, yet were it below our goodness to desire it:</hi> then which nothing surely can be in effect more popular; for good Kings all good men openly revere, and even the worst do it silently: Whilest Vertues beauty, not unlike some brightest Rayes, strikes into the most unwilling eyes. Wherefore as of late, I took in hand <hi>Tranquillus Suetonius,</hi> (who hath laid open the very bowels of the <hi>Cesars)</hi> to beguile in the time of your absence with some literate diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the tedious length of those dayes, and fell by chance upon that passage, so lively describing the wailings of <hi>Augustus,</hi> after the <hi>Varian</hi> defect, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten crying out, <hi>Render me, Quintilius Varus, my Legions;</hi> my desires of Your Majesty instantly fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out, and my wishes gowed for your Return: for it seemeth then much juster for <hi>England</hi> to have solicited her SISTER with these panting suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, then <hi>Augustus</hi> the Ghost of <hi>Quintilius, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store to me, Scotland my Sister, our King; Restore the best of men, whom none but the wicked love not; none but the ignorant praise not: Restore both the Director and Rule it self of Morality, whereby we may become not the gladder only, but the better too, while at hand we may contemplate (a thing most rare) One in highest Place, not inaulging to himself the least excess.</hi> Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, such you are (O best of Kings;) suffer I
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:102693:117"/>
humbly pray, if rather by Prayers then Arguments you choose to be inclined, That the nine Nations of different Language (for I reckon them no few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) over which you gently reign, may glory in your being such: and may each declare it, not in their native Dialects alone (which would not give sufficient compass to our joyes) but however, in this also more publick Tongue; That even for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners may know your <hi>Britany,</hi> which formerly bestowed upon the Christian World their first and most renowed Emperor, is not become so barren yet as not to afford, even at this day, a Type of the highest-famed King.</p>
                  <p>Having now thus (I hope) somewhat smooth'd the way to your patience, in hearing: good it will be henceforth out of the whole state of your Life and Carriage thus far, summarily to pick up some particulars, as those do who make their choice of Flowers. For I please my self more in the choice, then in the plenty of my Matter. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I am not ignorant neither, that in this kind of speaking, the diligence, or ambition of the Ancients was so profuse, that perhaps <hi>Timeus</hi> said not unwittily, That <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Macedonian</hi> sooner subdued all <hi>Asia,</hi> then <hi>Isocrates</hi> did write his <hi>Panegyrick.</hi> Certainly, there seems then to have been too great an indulgence to Art, while the Wits of Orators were wanton in that fertile age of Eloquence: but it becometh me (mindful both of my simplicity and age) to touch rather the heads of your praises, then to prosecute them all; that even the succinctness of my speech, may as it were, resemble the passage of my fleeting years. In the first place is offered the eminent Nobleness of your Extraction: whereby in a long Order of antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102693:117"/>
Kings, your lustre is above them all, your Father himself not excepted. This in brief I will deduce more clearly: Your Great Great-Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, (whether more valiant, or fortunate, I know not) being almost at once an Exile, and a Conqueror, united by the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> the white Rose, and the red, the Armories of two very powerful Families, which being in division, had so many years pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their own Countrey with bloud and deadly Fewds. The more blessed Colligation of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, then that of the Roses, we owe to the Happiness of your Father, who even for that alone were to be remembred ever with highest venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But, in you singly (most Imperial <hi>Charles)</hi> is the conflux of the glory of all Nations, in all Ages, which since the <hi>Romans</hi> have possessed <hi>Brita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> either by right, or by Arms; in you, I say, alone: whom the <hi>Cambrians</hi> first, the <hi>English-Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Scots, Normans,</hi> and finally the <hi>Danes</hi> do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with us, to be the branch of that Stock that hith erto hath worn the Crown. In this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance (if the meanness of the comparison be not rejected) not unlike to <hi>Europes</hi> famous <hi>Ister,</hi> which rolling along through vast Countreys, is ennobled with the waters of so many famous streams. One not obscure among our Authors, hath written, that our Ancestors would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the <hi>Norman</hi> Rule in <hi>England</hi> for legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate (which had so weak a beginning) until <hi>Maud</hi> marrying with <hi>Henry</hi> the First, had brought into the world a child of the bloud of the ancient <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings: she was Sister to <hi>David,</hi> Nephew twice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved off King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> your Progenitor.</p>
                  <p>How much is there now a nobler cause for our
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102693:118"/>
imbracing your Majesty with open arms, who are descended unto us from so plentiful a Race of Kings, since the access of the most ancient <hi>Cambri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Bloud to the rest of your Nobility, by Queen <hi>ANNE</hi> your Mother, a Lady of a great and masculine Mind? And how much the more truly may we now repeat, that which in the former Age <hi>Buchana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </hi> (a Poet, next the Ancients, of most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py invention) sang to your Grand-mother, I wish with happier fate!
<q>
                        <l>From numberless Progenitors you hold</l>
                        <l>Transmitted Scepters, which they sway'd of old.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all these hitherto you scarcely account your own. I pass then to such as are your own peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, which conferre no less of lustre, then they admit.</p>
                  <p>Three particulars we observe (O best of Kings,) which Appellation I now again willingly, (and shall often use) in your Beginnings, of no small importance to your succeeding Progress; as for the most part the first favour of Principles, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in the after-growths.</p>
                  <p>First, That you were not born to the supream hope of Soveraignty, so as flattery (though an evil swift and watchful) which attends the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of Potent Heirs, more gently pressed on your tender years. And the whiles your native good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness drank in with a draught more uncompounded the generous liquor of Integrity; for no doubt, how the earliest dispositions of private persons (much more of Princes) be at first formed, and as it were instilled, that I may so speak, is of highest importance to the Commonwealth; whereof they
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102693:118"/>
are to become afterwards not only the Props, but also the Precedents.</p>
                  <p>Next, That you succeeded a Brother of no small Natural Endowments, which begat thence-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in your Parents a more industrious and closer sedulity (for it surpasseth care) for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of their only Son: Nay, your own spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits daily grew the more intent, when now the weight of so vast an expectation was lodged on your self alone. Then were advanced to you such who faithfully instructed in learning that youth of yours, as yet unapt for business. Then such were sent for, who as your strength increased, dressed you in the exercises of the Horse; which I call to mind with how graceful a dexterity you managed: until afterwards at a solemn Tilting, I became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain whether you strook into the beholders more Joy or Apprehension.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, It comes to mind, that for some time, while Nature was as it were in strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, you were somewhat weak of limbs, and far below that vigour, which now with gladness we admire: which I may judge to have befallen by the secret Councel of Providence, thereby at that time to render more intense the care of furnishing your mind, as became the Heir, then secretly designed of a King; whom Malignants themselves deny not to have been the wisest of all Princes from many Ages past. From your first Essaies I shall hasten to your stronger times, not unmindful of my promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed business.</p>
                  <p>After your forraign Travels, obnoxious to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hazards, you came unto the Crown, whence it appeared, how much your self then dared to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, when the while at home each one was
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102693:119"/>
trembling for your sake. But the favour of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven brought you back safely to us; not so much as coloured with out-landish Dye; not unlike ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ulysses,</hi> who accounted it sufficient (even by <hi>Homers</hi> witness) <hi>To have known the Morals of Men and Cities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When you had assum'd the Crown, before all other things, there was resplendent in you a Religious mind: the Support of Kingdomes: the Joy of good men. The Chappel Royal was never more in order. The number of eminent Divines daily increased. Sermons in no age more frequented; In none more learned; And the example of the Prince more effectual then the Sermons. No execrations rashly proceeded from your mouth. Your ears abhorring, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any wanton, but even the least sordid word: which perchance under <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th, while toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Loves did raign, passed for Courtly eloquence; Neither stopped this piety within the Walls of Court, but was diffused also through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>The Church Revenues were not touched; Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples here and there new founded; D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>apidations repaired; And, (which Posterity will chiefly speak of) the Riches of your Kingdome, excited by your most religious exhortation, for restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church consecrated to the Apostle of the Nations, (out of question the amplest and equally ancient of the Christian world) which had sustained the injuries of time. Where your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties care was greatly conspicuous in demolishing those private dwellings which disgraced the aspect of so goodly a Fabrick: And not less in imposing the management of that whole business upon that
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102693:119"/>
most vigilant Prelate, who for his singular fidelity and judgement, hath lately merited far higher place.</p>
                  <p>Now (next to God) how tender was your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to your People? When the Sickness raged, by your Command recourse was had to publick Fastings. When we were pressed with greater fear then evil of Famine, the Horders of Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were constrained to open their Garners, and the prices of grain abated. Among these most pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cares, I cannot omit one peculiar Elogy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to your own providence, whereof I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the Original a little higher.</p>
                  <p>There were hatched abroad some years agone, or perhaps raked up out of Antiquity, certain Controversies about high points of the Creed, which having likewise flown over to us, (as flames of Wit are easily diffused) lest hereabout also both Pulpits and Pens might run to heat and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick disturbance: Your Majesty with most lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble temper by Proclamation suppressed on both sides all manner of debates. Others may think what pleaseth them; In my opinion (if I may have pardon for the phrase) <hi>The Itch of disputing, will prove the Scab of Churches.</hi> I shall relate what I have chanced more then once to observe. Two (namely) arguing about some subject so eagerly, till either of them transported by heat of contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from one thing to another, they both at length had lost first their Charity, and then also the Truth. Whither would restless subtilty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, if it were not bounded: there is of captious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness no end: but seasonable provision was made against it.</p>
                  <p>To these praises of Piety, I will adde a very
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102693:120"/>
great evidence of Gratitude: and almost a greater of Constancy, towards <hi>George Villiers</hi> Duke o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Buckingham:</hi> him, when amidst the dangers of the <hi>Spanish</hi> journey, he had been the nearest of your attendants, your Majesty afterwards, as in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, bore safely with you at home, through all the rocks of either Fortune, till an unforeseen day was his conclusion.</p>
                  <p>We observed also no ordinary beams of your Favour to be cast upon another of your trusty Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates in the same Journey, a Person of approved Judgement, Neither do I recount these only among the arguments of an heart mindful of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Offices (which indeed is Kingly) but likewise of singular obsequiousness towards your Father, even when deceased; to whom the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> had been for many years a Favourite: as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> Your Majesty had reputed your self as much the Heir of his Affections, as you were of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; An Example rare among the Memorials of all Ages. This Duke was indeed amiable in many respects, which seldome are concurrent. Each limb of his body almost very exactly composed: yet doubtful it was, whether his shape, or grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness excelled: undubitably of an undaunted spirit; equally intent upon his cares, whether imposed, or assumed: There was present with him in the midst of so many distractions an incredible temper and equability. I will not deny his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of glory, which generous minds do ever latest part from; but, above all, the most pleasing was, That he had no austerity of behaviour, nothing outwardly tumerous: but was obvious, affable, and almost to all men free and open: as if in so high a felicity, he had scarce been sensible of his
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102693:120"/>
happiness: for which alone he may seem to have deserved a more gentle end.</p>
                  <p>Hence forward there began to be powerful, and so daily holds on in your Majesties most important cares, a person unquestionably of an habitual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate life, and sober counsel: and the oftner try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the more acceptable; not sway'd to vanity, born to a solid prudence, whom to name might be injurious: for he that is described ingenuously, may be known without a name.</p>
                  <p>But the highest Empire over your affections, is deservedly challenged alone by the most worthy Consort of your Royal Bed, Her self likewise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a long descent of Kings. But suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient it is to know she is THE DAUGHTER OF <hi>HENRY</hi> THE GREAT, AND THE SISTER OF <hi>LEWIS</hi> THE JUST; Whom, for dearest pledges already of either Sex; for the comeliness of chastest graces, and (which chiefly blesseth the nuptial bed) For congruity of dispositions, Your Majesty so religiously and so particularly doth love, that justly you appear to have passed from the Title of the best Patron to that of the best Husband.</p>
                  <p>To Chastity, you have added Temperance, her nearest Companion: which in miserable and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent men, who would not pass by with silence? but these in a King! in one so young! of such vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous age! and in such a promptness of satisfying all desires, I know not whether we should more commend or admire them. Now, after these Elogies (which in part beget affection, in part also astonishment) to doubt once of the justness of your times, were most unjust. Yet shall I not think amiss to repeat a little at large, a thing of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102693:121"/>
noble example, in a person of obscure condition. There fell out at <hi>London,</hi> I know not what tumult, for one rescued from the Serjeants hands, whom for debt they were leading to Prison. Amidst those confusions, one or other (as oft it chances) died of sudden hurts; whereupon one <hi>John Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> a man of a ready hand (who had fatally run into the broyl) was apprehended as guilty of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: He wanted not intercessors of great power about your Majesty; and there seemed an assured hope of obtaining his pardon (as the vulgar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved) because he had attended on the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> in his Chamber, and among the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his own condition, had been for some time very acceptable to his Lord, for his singular abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of body, and skil in wrestling, whereof the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance as then was fresh, which perchance had made the poor man the more audacious. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the intercessions of the living, nor the mans own well known valour, nor finally the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of such a Favourite but lately dead, whom he had served, could prevail with Your Majesty above Justice, but that (which is glorious to speak) he concluded his life at the Gallowes. Fresher is the remembrance of that Noblemans Death, a Baron of very ancient linage, who suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered publickly for a fact, unworthy of his Birth. But, if a witty Authors old observation may yet have place, <hi>that some examples are nobler, others greater,</hi> I should verily believe the Barons Nobler, but <hi>Stamfords</hi> Greater.</p>
                  <p>But whither doth this pleasant meditation tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport me, while I revolve these things? At Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law Your Majesty hath in the Courts of strict Justice, able Judges, which pronounce severely:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102693:121"/>
you have also a most learned Chancellour for right and equity (not inferiour to the ancient Pretors) who, for the peoples relief, qualifieth that severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; But these are in distinct Courts placed apart. And if one should ask by chance, Why not toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, since that might seem the more dispatching way? I will deliver my opinion: It was the Wish of our Ancestors (out of a most grave providence) that Justice and Lenity, which have their seat dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in the inferiour Magistrate, might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociated in the only brest of the Soveraign. And truly so it is; for your Majesty being composed as it were, according to the wishes of those our Fore-Fathers, hath so tempered these together, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the evil presume, nor the good repine. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I would be understood to have only spoken of the restraint of common vices, which swarm in all parts of the world; for of more hainous trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions among our selves (by Gods goodness) we have not a word, no not so much as a dream: we suffer under an excellent ignorance: we know not what a Rebel is; what a plotter against the Common-weal: nor what that is, which Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians call <hi>Treason:</hi> the names themselves are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated with the things: and (in truth) no marvel; for, what wretch (unless he were of all mortal men the most stupid and wicked, and as foolish as malicious) would violate the quiet of so just and pious a Moderator?</p>
                  <p>Now as you maintain your Justice, (which I may call the health of your Kingdome) in a most even ballance, that is neither too much strething, nor slackning the Reins; so neither do you omit what concerneth security; The like else would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal Empires that happens to our bodies, which sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist

dangerously, if nothing but meer health sustain them. Wherefore after a War with two mighty Kings together, with various event (as it chances in humane affairs) and quieted by new Consedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on either side; your principal care at home, was to repair the Maritime strength, as became the Defender of Insular Kingdomes. Hence was the Navy Royal yearly more increased and furnished; and more commodious Harbours chosen for the Ships, and of read<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Amidst these things, it were unhandsome to pass by with silence that which the prudent of the time have noted; namely, that Your Majesty is more frequent at the Councels of State (as we call them) then any of our former Kings, except happily we cast back our eyes upon <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, whom they say, even in his Child hood, to have been seldome absent.</p>

                  <p>But the most splendid of all your entertainments, is your love of excellent Artificers, and Works: wherewith in either Art both of Picture and Scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture you have so adorned your Palaces, that <hi>Italy</hi> (the greatest Mother of Elegant Arts) or at least (next the <hi>Grecians)</hi> the principal Nursery may seem by your magnificence to be translated into <hi>England.</hi>

The beginning of the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> I must attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute vvholly or in great part to my Lord of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester;</hi> but yet as an Introducer, or supporter, not as a Teacher: for as I go along, it vvill easily appear, that he neither lived nor died by his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. Alwayes certain it is, that he drew him first into the fatal Circle from a kind of resolved privateness at his house at <hi>Lampsie,</hi> in <hi>South-wales;</hi> vvhere, after the Academical life, he had taken such a taste of the Rural, as I have heard him say, (and not upon any flashes or fumes of Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or traverses of discontent, but in a serene and quiet mood) that he could vvell have bent his mind to a retired course. About which time, the said Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> bewrayed a meaning to plant him in the Queens favour; vvhich vvas diversly interpreted by such as thought that great Artizan of Court to do nothing by chance, nor much by affection. Some therefore vvere of opinion, that feeling more and more in himself the vveight of time, and being almost tyred (if there be a satiety in Power) vvith that assiduous attendance, and intensive circumspection vvhich a long indulgent fortune did require, he vvas grown not unwilling, for his own ease, to bestow handsomly upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some part of the pains, and perhaps of the envy.</p>
                  <p>Others conceived rather, that having before for the same ends brought in, or let in Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi> and having found him such an apprentice as knew vvell enough how to set up for himself, he now meant to allie him vvith this young Earl, vvho had yet taken no strong impressions. For though the said Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> vvas a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, vvhereof I now speak by occasion, much
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102693:127"/>
fallen from his former splendour in Court: yet he still continued in some lustre of a favoured man, like billowes that sink by degrees, even vvhen the vvind is down that first stirred them.</p>
                  <p>Thus runs the discourse of that time at pleasure. Yet I am not ignorant, that there vvas some good vvhile a very stiff aversation in my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> from applying himself to the Earl of <hi>Leicester,</hi> for vvhat secret conceit I know not; but howsoever, that humour vvas mollified by time; and by his Mother; and to the Court he came under his lee.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> had another kind of Germination; and surely had he been a Plant, he vvould have been reckoned among the <hi>Sponte nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes,</hi> for he sprung vvithout any help, by a kind of congenial composure (as vve may term it) to the likeness of our late Soveraign and Master of ever blessed memory; vvho taking him into his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, taught him more and more to please himself, and moulded him, (as it vvere) Platonically, to his own <hi>Idea;</hi> delighting first in the choice of the Materials, because he found him susceptible of good form; and afterward by degrees, as great Architects use to do, in the vvorkmanship of his Regal hand: nor staying here, after he had hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and polished him about ten years in the School of observance, (for so a Court is) and in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of tryal about himself, (for he vvas a King could peruse men as vvell as books) he made him the associate of his Heir apparent, together vvith the now Lord <hi>Cottington</hi> (as an adjunct of singular experience and trust) in forraign travels, and in a business of Love, and of no equal hazard (if the tenderness of our zeal did not then deceive us;)

enough (the vvorld must confess) to kindle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection even betwixt the distantest conditions; so as by the various and inward conversation abroad, (besides that before and after at home) vvith the most constant and best natured Prince, <hi>Bona si sua nôrint,</hi> as ever <hi>England</hi> enjoyed, this Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes now secondly seized of favour, as it vvere by descent (though the condition of that estate be commonly no more then a Tenancy at vvill, or at most for the life of the first Lord) and rarely transmitted: vvhich I have briefly set down, vvithout looking beyond the vail of the Temple, I mean, into the secret of high inclinations; since even Satyrical Poets, (vvho are otherwise of so licentious fancy) are in this point modest enough to confess their ignorance.

                  </p>
                  <p>And these vvere both their springings and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primings, as I may call them.</p>
                  <p>In the profluence or proceedings of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, I observe likewise not only much difference between them; but in the Earl, not a little from himself. First, all his hopes of advancement had like to be strangled almost in the very Cradle, by throwing himself into the <hi>Portugal</hi> Voyage vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Queens consent, or so much as her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; vvhereby he left his friends and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants near six moneths in desperate suspense vvhat vvould become of him. And to speak truth, not vvithout good reason: For first, they might vvell consider, That he vvas himself not vvell plumed in favour for such a flight: Besides, That now he vvanted a Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi> at home (for he vvas
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102693:128"/>
dead the year before) to smooth his absence, and to quench the practises at Court. But above all, it lay open to every mans discourse, that though the bare offence to his Soveraign and Mistriss vvas too great an adventure; yet much more, vvhen she might (as in this case) have fairly discharged her displeasure upon her Laws. Notwithstanding, a noble report coming home before him, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn all vvas clear, and this excursion vvas esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but a Sally of youth: Nay, he grew every day more and more in her gracious conceit: vvhether such intermissions as these do sometimes foment af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; or that, having committed a fault, he became the more obsequious and plyant to redeem it: Or that she yet had not received into her Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al brest any shadows of his popularity.</p>
                  <p>There vvas another time long after, vvhen Sir <hi>Fulke Grevill</hi> (late Lord <hi>Brook)</hi> a man in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance intrinsecal vvith him, or at the least admitted to his Melancholly hours, either belike espying some vveariness in the Queen, or perhaps (vvith little change of the vvord, though more in the danger) some vvariness towards him; and vvork<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the present matter (as he vvas dexterous and close) had almost super-induced into favour the Earl of <hi>Southampton;</hi> vvhich yet being timely discovered, my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> chose to evaporate his thoughts in a Sonnet (being his common vvay) to be sung before the Queen, (as it vvas) by one <hi>Hales,</hi> in vvhose voice she took some pleasure; vvhereof the complot, me thinks, had as much of the Hermit as of the poet.

                        <l>And if thou should'st by her be now forsaken,</l>

As if he had been casting one eye back at the least to his former retiredness. But all this likewise quickly vanished, and there vvas a good vvhile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fair vveather over-head. Yet still, I know not how, like a gathering of Clouds, till towards his latter time, vvhen his humours grew Tart, as being now in the Lees of favour, it brake forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to certain sudden recesses; sometimes from the Court to <hi>Wansteed,</hi> otherwhiles unto <hi>Greenwich,</hi> often to his own Chamber; Doors shut, Visits forbidden, and vvhich vvas vvorse, divers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations (between) even vvith the Queen her self, (all preambles of ruine;) vvherewith, though now and then he did vvring out of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty some petty contentments, (as a man vvould press sowr Grapes) yet in the mean time vvas forgotten the Counsel of a Wise, and then a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Friend, vvho told him, that such courses as those vvere like hot Waters, vvhich help at a pang, but if they be too often used, vvill spoil the stomack.</p>
                  <p>On the Dukes part, vve have no such abrupt strayns and precipees as these, but a fair fluent and uniform course under both Kings: And surely, as there vvas in his natural Constitution a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous equality, vvhereof I shall speak more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; so there vvas an image of it in his Fortune, running (if I may borrow an ancient comparison) as smoothly as a numerous Verse, till it met vvith certain Rubs in Parliament, vvhereof I am indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the very Subject vvhich I handle, to say somewhat, so far as shall concern the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their times.</p>
                  <p>When my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> stood in favour, the Parliaments vvere calm: Nay, I find it a true ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102693:129"/>
that there vvas no Impeachment of any Nobleman by the Commons from the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, until the eighteenth of King <hi>James,</hi> nor any intervenient precedent of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; not that something or other could be vvant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be said, vvhile men are men: For not to go higher, vve are taught easily so much by the very Ballads and Libels of the <hi>Leicestrian</hi> time.</p>
                  <p>But about the aforesaid Year, many young ones being chosen into the House of Commons, more then had been usual in great Councels, (vvho though of the vveakest vvings, yet are the highest Flyers) there arose a certain unfortunate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful Spirit in some places; not sowing, but picking at every stone in the Field, rather then tending to the general Harvest. And thus far the consideration of the Nature of the Time hath transported me, and the occasion of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                  <p>Now on the other side, I must vvith the like li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty observe two vveighty and vvatchful Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes (as I may call them) vvhich kept the Earl in extreme and continual Caution, like a Bow still bent; vvhereof the Dukes thoughts vvere abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely free.</p>
                  <p>First, he vvas to vvrastle vvith a Queens decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or rather vvith her very setting Age (as vve may term it,) vvhich, besides other respects, is commonly even of it self the more umbratious and apprehensive, as for the most part all Horizons are charged vvith certain Vapours towards their Evening.</p>
                  <p>The other vvas a matter of more Circumstance, standing thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All Princes, especially those vvhom God hath
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:102693:130"/>
not blessed vvith natural issue, are (by vvisdome of State) somewhat shye of their Successors; and to speak vvith doe Reverence, there may be reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably supposed in Queens Regnant, a little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of tenderness that vvay, more then in Kings. Now there vvere in Court two names of <hi>Power,</hi> and almost of <hi>Faction;</hi> the <hi>Essexian,</hi> and the <hi>Cecilian,</hi> vvith their adherents; both vvell enough enjoying the present, and yet both looking to the future, and therefore both holding corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency vvith some of the principal in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had received advertisements and instructions, either from them, or immediately from the King, as indubiate Heir of this Imperial Crown.</p>
                  <p>But lest they might detect one another; this vvas Mysteriously carried by several instruments and conducts, and on the <hi>Essexian</hi> side, in truth, vvith infinite hazard: for Sir <hi>Robert Cecil,</hi> vvho (as Secretary of State) did dispose the publick Addresses, had prompter and safer conveyance; vvhereupon I cannot but relate a memorable pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage on either part, as the story following shall declare.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had accommodated Master <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Bacon</hi> in partition of his House, and had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed him a noble entertainment: This vvas a Gentleman of impotent feet, but a nimble head, and through his hand ran all the intelligences vvith <hi>Scotland;</hi> vvho being of a provident nature (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Brother the Lord Viscount St. <hi>Albons)</hi> and vvell knowing the advantage of a dangerous Secret, vvould many times cunningly let fall some vvords, as if he could much amend his Fortunes under the <hi>Cecilians</hi> (to vvhom he vvas near of alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and in bloud also) and vvho had made (as
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102693:130"/>
he was not unwilling should be believed) some great proffers to win him away: which once or twice he pressed so far, and with such tokens and signs of apparent discontent to my Lord <hi>Henry Howard,</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> (who was of the party, and stood himself inmuch Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage with the Queen) that he flyes presently to my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> (with whom he was commonly <hi>primae admissionis,</hi> by his bed side in the morning) and tells him, that unless that Gentleman were presently satisfied with some round summe, all would be vented.</p>
                  <p>This took the Earl at that time ill provided (as indeed oftentimes his Coffers were low) whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he was fain suddenly to give him <hi>Essex-</hi>House; which the good old Lady <hi>Walsingham</hi> did afterwards dis-ingage out of her own store with 2500 pound; and before, he had distilled 1500 pound at another time by the same skil. So as we may rate this one Secret, as it was finely carried, at 4000 pounds in present money, besides at the least 1000 pound of annual pension to a private and bed-rid Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: What would he have gotten if he could have gone about his own business?</p>
                  <p>There was another accident of the same nature on the <hi>Cecilian</hi> side, much more pleasant, but less chargeable, for it cost nothing but wit. The Queen having for a good while not heard any thing from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and being thirsty of news, it fell out that her Majesty going to take the air towards the Heath (the Court being then at <hi>Greenwich)</hi> and Master Secretary <hi>Cecill</hi> then attending her, a Post came crossing by, and blew his Horn, The Queen out of curiosity asked him from whence the Dispatch came, and being answered, From <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:102693:131"/>
she stops the Coach, and calleth for the Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et. The Secretary, though he knew there were i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> it some Letters from his Correspondents, which to discover, were as so many Serpents; yet made more shew of diligence, then of doubt to obey; and asks some that stood by (forsooth in great hast) for a knife to cut up the Packet (for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he might perhaps have awaked a little appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension;) but in the mean time approaching with the Packet in his hand, at a pretty distance from the Queen, he telleth her, it looked and smelt ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favouredly, coming out of a filthy budget, and that it should be fit first to open and air it, because he knew she was a verse from ill sents. And so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dismissed home, he got leasure by this seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble shift, to sever what he would not have seen.</p>
                  <p>These two accidents, precisely true, and known to few, I have reported as not altogether extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant from my purpose, to shew how the Earl stood in certain perplexities, wherewith the Dukes dayes were not distracted. And this hath been the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical part (as it were) touching the difference between them in the rising and flowing of their fortunes.</p>
                  <p>I will now consider their several indowments both of <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Mind,</hi> and then a little of their <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Ends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earl was a pretty deal the taller, and much the stronger, and of the abler body: But the Duke had the neater limbs and freer delivery; he was also the uprighter, and of the more comely motions; for the Earl did bend a little in the neck, though rather forwards, then downwards: and he was so far from being a good Dancer, that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102693:131"/>
he was no graceful goer. If we touch particulars, the Duke exceeded in the daintiness of his leg and foot, and the Earl in the incomparable fairness and fine shape of his hands; which (though it be but feminine praise) he took from his Father: For the general Air, the Earl had the closer and more reserved Countenance, being by nature some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more cogitative, and (which was strange) never more then at meals, when others are least: Insomuch, as he was wont to make his observation of himself, that to solve any knotty business which cumbred his mind, his ablest hours were when he had checked his first appetite with two or three morsels, after which he sate usually for a good while silent: yet he would play well and willingly at some games of greatest attention, which shewed that when he listed, he could licence his thoughts.</p>
                  <p>The Duke on the other side, even in the midst of so many diversions, had continually a very pleasant and vacant face (as I may well call it) proceeding no doubt from a singular assurance in his temper. And yet I must here give him a rarer Elogy, which the malignest eye cannot deny him, That certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, never man in his place and power, did enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain greatness more familiarly, nor whose looks were less tainted with his felicity; wherein I insist the rather, because this in my judgement was one of his greatest vertues and victories of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, in the attiring and ornament of their bodies, the Duke had a fine and unaffected politeness, and upon occasion costly, as in his Legations.</p>
                  <p>The Earl, as he grew more and more attentive
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102693:132"/>
to business and matters, so less and less curious of cloathing: Insomuch, as I do remember, those about him had a conceit, that possibly sometimes when he went up to the Queen, he might scant know what he had on; for this was his manner: His Chamber being commonly stived with Friends or Suiters of one kind or other, when he was up, he gave his legs, arms, and brest to his ordinary ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to button and dress him, with little heed, his head and face to his Barber, his eyes to his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ears to Petitioners, and many times all at once; then the Gentleman of his Robes throwing a cloak over his shoulders, he would make a step into his Closet, and after a short prayer, he was gone: only in his Baths, he was somewhat deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. For point of diet and luxury, they were both very inordinate in their appetites, especially the Earl, who was by nature of so indifferent a taste, that I must tell a rare thing of him (though it be but a homely note) that he would stop in the midst of any physical Potion, and after he had lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his lips, he would drink off the rest; but I am weary of such slight Animadversions.</p>
                  <p>To come therefore to the inward furniture of their Minds, I will thus much declare.</p>
                  <p>The Earl was of good Erudition, having been placed at study in <hi>Cambridge</hi> very young by the Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> his Guardian, with affectionate and deliberate care, under the oversight of Doctor <hi>Whitgift,</hi> then Master of <hi>Trinity Colledge,</hi> and after Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> A man (by the way) surely of most Reverend and Sacred memory, and (as I may well say) even of the Primitive temper; when the Church by lowliness of spirit, did flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in high examples: which I have inserted as a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102693:132"/>
due recordation of his vertues, having been much obliged to him for many favours in my younger time.</p>
                  <p>About sixteen years of his age, (for thither he came at twelve) he took the formality of Master of Arts, and kept his publick Acts. And here I must not smother what I have received by constant Information, That his own Father died with a very cold conceit of him; some say, through the affection to his second son <hi>Walter Devereux,</hi> who was indeed a diamond of the time, and both of an hardy and delicate temper and mixture: But it seems, this Earl, like certain vegetables, did bud and open slowly; Nature sometimes delighting to play an afrer-game as well as Fortune, which had both their turns and tides in course.</p>
                  <p>The Duke was Illiterate, yet had learned at Court, first to sift and question well, and to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his own defects, by the drawing or flowing unto him of the best Instruments of experience and knowledge, from whom he had a sweet and attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive manner, to suck what might be for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or his own proper use; so as the less he was favoured by the Muses, he was the more by the Graces.</p>
                  <p>To consider them in their pure Naturals, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Earls Intellectual faculties to have been his stronger part, and in the Duke his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical.</p>
                  <p>Yet all know, that he likewise at the first was much under the expectation of his after-proof; such a Solar influence there is in the Soveraign aspect. For their Abilities of discourse or pen, the Earl was a very acute and sound speaker when he would intend it; and for his writings, they are
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102693:133"/>
beyond example, especially in his familiar Letters and things of delight at Court, when he would admit his serious habits, as may be yet seen in his Impresses and Inventions of entertainment, and above all in his darling piece of love, and self love; his Stile was an elegant perspicuity, rich of phrase, but seldome any bold Metaphors; and so far from Tumour, that it rather wanted a little Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>The Dukes delivery of his mind, I conceive not to be so sharp, as solid and grave; not so solid and deep, as pertinent, and apposite to the times and occasions.</p>
                  <p>The Earl I account the more liberal, and the Duke the more magnificent; for I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> in all his life time did build or adorn any house, the Queen perchance spending his time, and himself his means; or otherwise inclining to popular wayes; for we know the people are apter to applaud house-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, then house-raisers. They were both great cherishers of Scholars and Divines; but it seems the Earl had obtained of himself one singular point, that he could depart his affection between two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams: for though he bare alwayes a kind of filial reverence towards Dr. <hi>Whitgift,</hi> both before and after he was Archbishop; yet on the other side, he did not a little love and tender Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> though I think truly, with large distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Persons and the Causes, however he was taxed with other ends in respecting that party.</p>
                  <p>They were both fair-spoken Gentlemen, not prone and eager to detract openly from any man; and in this the Earl hath been most falsly blemished
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:102693:133"/>
in our vulgar Story: only against one man he had forsworn all patience, namely <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and would call him <hi>(per Excellentiam)</hi> the Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant (as if it had been an Embleme of his name) even to the Queen her self, though of no small in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuation with her; and one Lady likewise (that I may civilly spare to nominate, for her sex sake) whom he used to term the Spider of the Court: yet generally in the sensitive part of their Natures, the Earl was the worst Philosopher, being a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter, and a weak Dissembler of the least disgrace: And herein likewise, as in the rest, no good Pupil to my Lord of <hi>Leicester,</hi> who was wont to put all his passions in his pocket.</p>
                  <p>In the growth of their Fortunes, the Duke was a little the swifter, and much the greater; for from a younger Brothers mean estate, he rose to the highest degree whereof a Subject was capable, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Title or Trust. Therein I must confess, much more consortable to <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> under <hi>Henry the Eight,</hi> who was equal to him in both.</p>
                  <p>For matter of Donative and addition of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, I do not believe that the Duke did much exceed him, all considered, under both Kings.</p>
                  <p>For that which the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had received from her Majesty, besides the Fees of his Offices, and the disposition of great Summes of money in her Armies, was (about the time of his Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when faults use to be aggravated with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent benefits) valued at three hundred thousand pounds sterling in pure gift for his only use, by the Earl of <hi>Dorset,</hi> then Lord Treasurer; who was a wise man, and a strict Computist, and not well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards him. And yet it is worthy of note
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:102693:134"/>
in the Margent of both Times, that the one was prosecuted with silence, and the other with mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure; So undoing a measure is popular judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</p>
                  <p>I cannot here omit between them a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in establishing of both their Fortunes and Fames.</p>
                  <p>For the first: the Duke had a care to introduce into near place at the Court divers of his confident Servants, and into high places very sound and grave Personages. Whereas, except a Pensioner or two, we can scant name any one man advanced of the Earls breeding, but Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been his Secretary; who yet came never fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (though married into a noble House) then to the Clerk of the Councel, and Register of the Parliament: not that the Earl meant to stand alone like a Substantive (for he was not so ill a Grammarian in Court;) but the Truth is in this point, the <hi>Cecilians</hi> kept him back, as very well <hi rend="margQuotes">knowing that upon every little absence or disassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity, he should be subject to take cold at his back.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the other, in the managing of their Fames, I note between them a direct contrary wisdome; For the Earl proceeded by way of Apology, which he wrote and dispersed with his own hands at large, though till his going to <hi>Ireland</hi> they were but aiery objections. But of the Duke this I know, that one a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ing offered for his ease to do him that kind of Service; He refused it with a pretty kind of thankful scorn, saying, that he would trust his own good intentions which God knew, and leave to him the pardoning of his Errours; and that he saw no fruit of Apologies, but the multiplying of

discourse; which surely was a well setled Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime. And for my own particular (though I am not obnoxious to his memory, in the expression of <hi>Tacitus, Neque injuria, neque beneficio,</hi> saving that he shewed me an ordinary good Countenance: And if I were, yet I would distinguish between Gratitude and Truth) I must bear him this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that in a Commission laid upon me by So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Command, to examine a Lady about a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain filthy accusation, grounded upon nothing but a few single names taken up by a Foot-man in a kennel, and straight baptized, [A list of such as the Duke had appointed to be poysoned at home, himself being then in <hi>Spain:]</hi> I found it to be the most malicious and frantick surmize, and the most contrary to his nature, that I think had ever been brewed from the beginning of the World, how so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever countenanced by a Libellous Pamphlet of a fugitive Physician even in Print; and yet of this would not the Duke suffer any answer to be made on his behalf, so constant he was to his own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
                  <p>In their Military Services, the Characters of the Earls imployments were these, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His forwardest, was that of <hi>Portugal,</hi> before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The saddest, that of <hi>Roan,</hi> where he lost his brave Brother.</p>
                  <p>His fortunatest piece I esteem the taking of <hi>Cadiz Malez,</hi> and no less modest; for there he wrote with his own hands a censure of his Omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>His jealousest imployment was to the relief of <hi>Calais,</hi> besieged by the Cardinal Arch-duke: about
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102693:135"/>
which, there passed then between the Queen and the <hi>French</hi> King much Art.</p>
                  <p>His Voyage to the <hi>Azores</hi> was the best, for the discovery of the <hi>Spanish</hi> weakness, and otherwise almost a saving Voyage.</p>
                  <p>His blackest was that to <hi>Ireland,</hi> ordained to be the Sepulchre of his Father, and the Gulph of his own Fortunes.</p>
                  <p>But the first, in 88, at <hi>Tilbury Camp,</hi> was in my judgement, the very poyson of all that followed; for there whilest the Queen stood in some doubt of a <hi>Spanish invasion</hi> (though it proved but a Morrice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon our Waves) she made him in Field Commander of the Cavalry (as he was before in Court,) and much graced him openly in view of the Souldiers and people, even above my Lord of <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>icester:</hi> the truth is, from thenceforth he fed too fast.</p>
                  <p>The Dukes imployment abroad in this nature, was only in the Action of the <hi>Isle of Reez,</hi> of which I must note somewhat for the honour of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and of His Majesties times, and of them that perished and survived, and to redeem it generally from mis-understanding. Therefore after enquiry amongst the wisest and most indifferent men, of that Action, I dare pronounce, that all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances pondered, A tumultuary landing on our part, with about 1000 in the whole; On theirs, ready to receive us, some 200 Horse, with near 2000 Foot, and watching their best time of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, none of their Foot discovered by us before, nor so much as suspected, and only some of their Horse descryed stragling, but not in any bulk or body; their Cavalry not a Troop of <hi>Biscoigners,</hi> mounted in hast, but the greater part Gentlemen
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:102693:135"/>
of Family, and of pickt Resolution, and such as charged home both in Front and on both Flanks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very sea; about sixscore of their 200 Horse strewed upon the Sand, and none of them but one killed with a great shot; and after this, their Foot likewise coming on to charge, till not liking the business, they fell to flinging of stones, and so walked away.</p>
                  <p>I say, these things considered and laid together, we have great reason to repute it a great impression upon an unknown place, and a noble argument, that upon occasion, we have not lost our Ancient vigour. Only I could wish that the Duke, who then in the animating of the Souldiers shewed them very eminent assurance of his valour, had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards remembred that rule of <hi>Apelles, Manum de Tabula.</hi> But he was greedy of honour, and hot upon the publick ends, and too confident in the prosperity of beginnings, as somewhere <hi>Polybius, that great Critique</hi> of war, observeth of young Leaders, whom fortune hath not before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>In this their Military care and dispensation of reward and punishment, there was very few remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable occasions under the Duke, saving his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual vigilancy and voluntary hazard of his person, and kindnesses to the Souldiers, both from his own table and purse; for there could be few disorders within an Island where the Troops had no scope to disband, and the inferiour Commanders were still in sight.</p>
                  <p>In the Earl we have two examples of his severity, the one in the Island Voyage, where he threw a Souldier with his own hand out of a Ship; the other in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he decimated certain
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:102693:136"/>
Troops that ran away, renewing a piece of the <hi>Roman</hi> Discipline.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, we have many of his Lenity, and one of his Facility, when he did connive at the bold Trespass of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> who before his own arrival at <hi>Fayall,</hi> had landed there against his precise Commandment; at which time he let fall a Noble word, being pressed by one, (whose name I need not remember) that at the least he would put him upon a Martial Court: That I would do (said he) if he were my friend.</p>
                  <p>And now I am drawing towards the last act, which was written in the Book of necessity.</p>
                  <p>At the Earls end I was abroad, but when I came home (though little was left for Writers to glean after Judges) yet, I spent some curiosity to search what it might be that could precipitate him into such a prodigious Catastrophe; and I must, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my professed freedome, deliver a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance or two of some weight in the truth of that story, which was neither discovered at his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment, nor after in any of his private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions.</p>
                  <p>There was amongst his nearest attendants, one <hi>Henry Cuffe,</hi> a man of secret ambitious ends of his own, and of proportionate Counsels smothered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the habit of a Scholar, and slubbered over with a certain rude and clownish fashion, that had the semblance of integrity.</p>
                  <p>This Person, not above five or six weeks before my Lords fatal irruption into the City, was by the Earls Special Command suddenly discharged from all further attendance, or access unto him, out of an inward displeasure then taken against his sharp
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102693:136"/>
and importune infusions, and out of a glimmering oversight, that he would prove the very Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ruine.</p>
                  <p>I must adde hereunto, that about the same time my Lord had received from the Countess of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> (a Lady powerful in the Court, and indeed a vertuous user of her power) the best advice that I think was ever given from either Sex; That when he was free from Restraint, he should closely take any out-lodging at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and sometimes when the Queen went abroad in a good humour, (whereof she would give him notice) he should come forth, and humble himself before Her in the Field.</p>
                  <p>This Counsel sunk much into him, and for some dayes he resolved it: but in the mean time, through the intercession of the Earl of <hi>Southampton,</hi> whom <hi>Cuffe</hi> had gained, he was restored to my Lords ear, and so working advantage upon his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces, and upon the vain foundation of vulgar breath, which hurts many good men, spun out the final destruction of his Master and himself, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of his Restorer, if his pardon had not been won by inches.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that the Earl in <hi>Westminster-hall</hi> did in general disclose the evil perswasions of this man; but the particulars which I have related of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and restitution, he buried in his own brest for some reasons apparent enough; indeed (as I conjecture) not to exasperate the Case of my Lord of <hi>Southampton,</hi> though he might therewith a little peradventure have mollified his own. The whole and true Report I had by infallible means from the person himself that both brought the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from the aforesaid excellent Lady, and carried
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102693:137"/>
the discharge to <hi>Cuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>,</hi> who in a private Chamber was strucken therewith into a swoun almost dead to the earth, as if he had fallen from some high Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: such Turrets of hope he had built in his own Fancy.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Dukes sudden period, how others have represented it unto their Fancies, I cannot determine: for my part, I must confess from my soul, that I never recall it to mind without a deep and double astonishment of my discourse and reason:</p>
                  <p>First of the very horror and atrocity of the Fact in a Christian Court, under so moderate a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but much more at the impudency of the pretence, whereby a desperate discontented Assassinate would after the perpetration have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nested a meer private revenge (as by precedent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances is evident enough) with I know not what publick respects, and would fain have given it a Parliamentary cover. Howsoever, thus these two great Peers were dis-robed of their Glory, the one by judgement, the other by violence, which was the small distinction.</p>
                  <p>Now after this short contemplation of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities (for much more might have been spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but that I was fitter for Rapsody then Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary) I am lastly desirous to take a summary view of their Conformities, which I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve will be found as many, though perchance heeded by few, as are extant in any of the ancient Parallel.</p>
                  <p>They both slept long in the arms of Fortune: They were both of ancient blood, and of Forraign extraction: They were both of straight and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stature, and of able and active bodies: They
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:102693:137"/>
were both industrious and assiduous, and attentive to their ends: They were both early Privy-Councellors, and imployed at home in the secretest and weightiest affairs in Court and State: They were both likewise Commanders abroad in Chief, as well by Sea, as by Land: both Masters of the Horse at home, both chosen Chancellours of the same University, namely, <hi>Cambridge:</hi> They were both indubitable strong, and high-minded men; yet of sweet and accostable Nature, almost equally delighting in the press and affluence of Dependants and Suiters, which are alwayes the Burres, and sometimes the Briers of Favourites. They were both married to very vertuous Ladies, and sole Heirs, and left issue of their Sex, and both their Wives converted to contrary Religions. They were both in themselves rare and excellent exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Temperance and Sobriety; but neither of them of Continency.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, after they had been both subject (as all Greatness and Splendor is) to certain obloquies of their actions; They both concluded their earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly felicity in unnatural ends, and with no great distance of time in the space either of life or favour.</p>
                  <p>And so having discharged this poor Exercise of my Pen according to my Knowledge and Reality, let us commit those two noble Peers to their Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rest, with their memorable abilities remaining in few, and their compassionate infirmities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all.</p>

                     <hi>For no question, he found advantage from the stock of his Fathers Reputation; the people looking on his quality with reverence (for I do not find that any young Nobleman had yet surprized their hopes, or drawn their eyes) and on his youth with pity; for they were nothing satisfied concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Fathers death, who had been advanced to honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dangers by the mediation of such as delighted not in his company; as it was the mysterious wisdome of those times to poyson with oyl,</hi> &amp; homines per honores ferire. <hi>And if there were not any such compassion in the Queen, yet surely she beheld him as the son of an excellent man, that died in her service, and had left a precious fame sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving.</hi>

                     <hi>and went General of the Horse in a great Army, though he was not full nineteen years of age, there being then no such Criticismes as interpreted the acceptance or pursuit even of the greatest dignity and command, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy against the State; but all men were glad to see him set himself so brave a task, by undertaking such an Imployment.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>From this first action he took a Charter of the peoples hearts, which was never cancell'd; but as if they had looked only on the boldness, not the success of his enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, he was sure to return with triumph, though the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age miscarried: for amongst all his forraign undertakings, if they be weighed in the peoples usual Scale, the Cost, though there was not above one or two prosperous returns, and as many that had sad and calamitous issues; yet he never suffered the least publick imputation or murmure; but was received with that joy, as if the Fleet or Army were sent out to bring him home, not any spoil or conquest, (to which he had wholly dedicated his faculties.)</hi>

                     <hi>Surely, I by no means imagine him built or furnished for a Courtier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For however the Arts and mysteries of a Court are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definable, yet as in the reformation and improvement of all Sciences, there are certain principles and maximes unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable and unquestionable, so there is a certain comparity, conformity, and complacency in the manners, and a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet subtilty in the composition, without which (as with those principles) no man in any Age or Court shall be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in the</hi> Aulical <hi>function.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now how ill the Earl was read in this Philosophy, his</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:102693:139"/>
                     <hi>servant</hi> Cuffe <hi>(whose observations were sharp enough, whatever Stoicismes raved in his nature) well discerned, when he said,</hi> Amorem &amp; odium semper in fronte gessit, nec celare novit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I shall not impute it to his want of</hi> will <hi>(though that would be but an ill argument, for his Courtship) nor of</hi> power, <hi>for he did many greater things; but only of</hi> skil <hi>to contrive conveniences of honours and preferments at Court, for such friends as might have been good out-works to have fortifi'd and secur'd his own condition, except all his dependants were of another complexion then could have lived in that Air.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And indeed, I do not find that the Earl much inclined to, or desired the reputation of a Courtier, besides the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of himself, and the Queens affection (which yet he endeavoured rather to master, then to win;) but he seemed, though he had such places of honour and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance as be the most significant badges of a Courtier, but</hi> in pace belli gerere negotium, <hi>and retired only from the War to prevent Peace.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Then if we visit his correspondencies abroad (which he rather maintained out of state, then contrived out of skil) we shall see they were alwayes with an eye upon actions, and his Intelligences had ever some hint of Tumult and Commotion; as if the King of</hi> Spain <hi>was loud or frantick at his devotions, as when he vowed at Mass, that he would be reveng'd of</hi> England, <hi>though he sold all those Candlesticks upon the Altar: This Information was given by the Earl. But it was observed then, that if there were ought intended against the Life or Person of the Queen, though it were in the Court of</hi> Spain, <hi>where the Earl had especially his Leigiers, the first notice came over by my Lord</hi> Cecil, <hi>for whom (indeed) it seemed as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary there should be treasons, as for the State that they should be prevented. Insomuch as it was then (how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly</hi>
                     <pb n="188" facs="tcp:102693:140"/>
                     <hi>soever) conceived, that though he created none, yet he fomented some conspiracies, that he might give fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent evidences of his loyalty, having no other advantage (as the Earl and others had in person) to justifie him in an ordinary estimation, but by eminent services.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And those he knew must be best relished, that concerned her own preservation; and therefore in the least vacations from Treasons, he was ever busie to set on foot some vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and tender Law (as there was scarce any Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without some such) that had a peculiar eye to the Queens safety. Which (however they are by such as cannot apprehend the danger of those times, looked upon without much reverence) could not but make singular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression in the Queens heart of his fidelity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Incumbrances that the Earl had to wrestle withal (for I shall only look over his life without particular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into his actions, which had all glorious ends, or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious intentions) were fewer then ever any great man ever met withal, and his advantages more in number, and in weight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>'Tis true, he was rivall'd by a strong and subtile facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which cared and consulted for his ruine, as a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they must build upon; and were intent to betray him abroad, and mis-interpret him at home: yet the danger was thus allay'd, that they were all his publique and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed enemies, and so known unto the Queen, that they durst never impertinently urge ought against him, since they were sure their malice was concluded, when the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their objection happily might not be considered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And indeed, that trick of countenancing and protecting factions (as that Queen almost her whole Reign did with singular and equal demonstration of grace look upon several persons of most distinct wishes one towards another) was not the least ground of much of her quiet and success. And she never doubted but that men that were never so opposite</hi>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:102693:140"/>
                     <hi>in their good will each to others, nor never so dishonest in their projectments for each others confusion, might yet be reconciled into their Allegiance towards her. Insomuch, that during her whole Reign, she never endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile any personal differences in the Court, though the unlawful emulations of persons of nearest trust about her, were even like to overthrow some of her chiefest designs. A Policy seldome entertained by Princes, especially if they have issues to survive them.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Among the advantages the Earl had (and he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that will distinguish him from any man that hath, or is likely to succeed him) I shall rank the nature and the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of that time in the first place.

                     <hi>'Twas an ingenuous un-inquisitive time, when all the passions and affections of the people were lapped up in such an innocent and humble obedience, that there was never the least contestations, nor capitulations with the Queen, nor (though she very frequently consulted with her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) any further reasons urged of her actions, then her own will.</hi>

                     <hi>When there were any grievances, they but reverently conveyed them to her notice, and left the time and order of the rest to her Princely discretion.

                     <hi>time the Queens remarkable Grace indeared the Earl to the regard of the people, which he quickly improved to a more tender estimation; neither was this affection of theirs ever an objection against him, till himself took too much notice of it; for the Queen had ever loved her people without the least scruple of jealousie, nor was ever offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if he was the darling of their eyes, till she suspected he inclined to be the darling of their hearts.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>In his Friendships he was so fortunate, that though he contracted with ancient enemies, and such as he had unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by some unkindness, as grievous as injurious, it is not known that ever he was betrayed in his trust, or had ever his secrets derived unhandsomly to any ears that they were not intended to: and this, if he had not planted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon such, whose zeal to his service was more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then their other abilities, would have preserved him from so prodigious a fate.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly, he had so strong an harbour in the Queens brest, that notwithstanding these dangerous indiscretions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting himself in his recreations and shooting-matches to the publique view of so many thousand Citizens, which usually flocked to see him, and made within the reach of his own ears large acclamations in his praise; notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his receiving into his troop of attendance, and under that shadow bringing into the Court, divers persons not liked by the Queen, and some that had been in prison for suspicion of Treason, as Captain</hi> Wainman; <hi>and then his glorious feather-triumph, when he caused two thousand Orange-tawny Feathers, in despight of Sir</hi> Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh, <hi>to be worn in the Tilt-yard, even before Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties own face (all which would have found regret in the stomacks of most Princes:) yet neither these, nor any whispers that were distill'd into the Queens ears (for ought appears) ever lessened him in her Highness's regard, till he committed such strange mistakes as ever have been</hi>

                     <hi>prosecuted with most exemplary punishments by the Lawes themselves: which (though in jealousie of Princes, they oft compound Treasons out of circumstances and possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities) yet are as tender of the reputation of great men as in any Commonwealth whatsoever.</hi>

                     <hi>If toward his period the Queen grew a less merciful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of his failings and successes; 'twas when she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he grew too familiar, and in love with his passions, and had a mind not to be satisfied but upon his conditions, and too insensible of his own errors. And (truly) that would not be unfitly applyed to him, that was once said of the terrible</hi> Mountford <hi>Earl of</hi> Leicester, <hi>in the reign of</hi> Henry <hi>the Third; (though nothing be more horrible to me then the petulancy of that wit, which for an unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some jest, would accuse him of a purpose to be King (for doubtless in his solemn purposes he was of a firm and unsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken allegiance) that he had a spirit too great for a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. For besides that he look'd from above, and with a displeasure that had a mixture of scorn more then anger up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such as courted not his protection, his talk was in an high and unusual dialect; he took much delight to discover an hatred (like a contempt) of the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>and would often mention his person as familiarly as</hi> Luther <hi>did our</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighth; and as</hi> Fox <hi>begins his Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Pope with the first lines of</hi> Tullies <hi>Oration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> Cataline, Quousque tandem, <hi>&amp;c. and so he would write in his ordinary Letters, and publish in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology,</hi> I will teach that proud King to know, <hi>&amp;c. Which sounded possibly not so acceptable to the Queen her self, who though she were perfect enough in her dislike to that King, thought that the greatest Subject ought not to approach the infirnities, or the mention of any King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some reverence. And the Earl in his zeal to the</hi> Hollanders <hi>(when the great design was to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate a Truce between</hi> Spain <hi>and them, and almost</hi>

                     <hi>the whole Councel-board inclin'd that way) would not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the violence of his opposition shew a dislike to the inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and tyranny of the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>but of the very Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Monarchy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then his carriage towards the Queen her self was very strange, and his usual converse upon too bold terms, which proceeded not from any distemper but his passions, (though natural choler be but an unruly excuse for roughness with Princes:) but 'twas a way of traffick (I know not upon what unlucky success) he had from the beginning fancied, and lasted even to his end. Insomuch, as upon his first restraint, (which was not many moneths before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion) he did somewhat neglect the Queens pardon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it came not accompanied with a new grant of his Lease of the farm of sweet Wines, which was then near expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; though she intimated to him, that she only deferred that Grace upon the Physicians Maximes:</hi> Corpora im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pura, quo magis pascas, laeseris.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly, If ever that uncouth speech fell from him to the Queen, which is delivered to us by one that was much conversant then in the secrets of the Court, That she was as crooked in her disposition, as in her carcass (when haply there was a little unevenness in her shoulders) all my wonder at his destruction is taken from me: and I must needs confess, I am nothing satisfied with that loose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which hath crept into our discourse, that shortly after his miserable end, (which indeed deserved compassion from all hearts) I know not upon what unseasonable delivery of a Ring or Iewel by some Lady of the Court, the Queen expressed much reluctancy for his death. I am sure no discovery, no expression, either to his Memory, Friends, or Dependants, can weigh down the indignity of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon at</hi> Pauls Cross, <hi>and set out by Command, or that Discourse that was so carefully commended abroad of his Treasons; which were two of the most pestilent Libels</hi>

                     <hi>against his Fame, that any Age hath seen published a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any Malefactour, and could not with that delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have been contrived, and justified by Authority, had not there been some sparks of indignation in the Queen that were unquenched even with his blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>'Tis time to call my self homewards to the view of those considerations, in which will clearly appear the in-quality of the Dukes condition, to what hath been said of the Earl: and it may be, I have been at my distance too bold an undertaker of these actions, which were performed so many years before my cradle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I shall not much insist on the Dukes Morning, being so different from that of the Earls, as would discountenance all purposes of bringing them into one circle; he had no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in his friendships, or pretence in his quality, but was his own Harbinger at Court. For though the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld may walk in as large a Field of his Pedegree, as shall concern any Subject, yet that being no in-let to his advancements, or occasion of his favour, I shall leave to such as shall have the preferment to write his Life. 'Tis true, that soon after his approach was found to be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that he was like enough to be entertained by Him that had most power to bid him welcome; he received pretty conveniences from the respects of some great men, which at most (being as much out of disaffection to others, as tenderness to him) yielded him rather assistance, then support; so that indeed he was (if ever any)</hi> Faber fortunae suae: <hi>and all such as will not be impudent stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the discerning spirit of that King who first cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, cannot but impute it to a certain innate wisdome and vertue that was in him, with which he surprized, and even fascinated all the faculties of his incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Master.

                     <hi>all such as either look'd out of judgement, or gazed out of curiosity, were quickly directed towards him, as a man in the delicacy and beauty of his colour, decency and grace of his motion, the most rarely accomplished they had ever beheld; whilest some that found inconveniences in his nearness, intended by some affront to discountenance his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminacy, till they perceived he had masked under it so terrible a courage as would safely protect all his sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And now he quickly shewed the most glorious Star that ever shined in any Court; insomuch that all Nations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted him with love and wonder, as fast as the King with Grace; and to his last he never lost any of his lustre.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His swiftness and nimbleness in rising, may be with less injury ascribed to a Vivacity, then any Ambition in his nature; since it is certain the Kings eagerness to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him, so surprized his youth, that he seemed only to submit his shoulders, without resistance to such burdens as his Highness would be pleased to lay on him; and rather to be held up by the violent inclination of the King, then to climb up by any Art or industry of his own: yet once seat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he would not affront that judgement that raised him, by an unseasonable diffidence of himself, but endeavoured with an understanding boldness to manage those imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which his modesty would never suffer him to court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>During the Reign of his first Master, I cannot but say, he enjoyed an indifferent calm in his Fortune and Favour; for though there were some boisterous interruptions by the clamour of the people, yet shortly again their affections were as violent (and almost as senseless) toward him, as ever their accusations were before or after; Insomuch as the Chief Rulers among them performed frequent visits to him, when he was somewhat diseased in his health, and out of a zealous care of him, would have begot in him some jealousie, that his Physicians and nearest Attendants</hi>

And here the Fortunes of our great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages met, when they were both the Favourites of the Princes, and Darlings of the people.

                  <p>
                     <hi>And now 'tis seasonable to say somewhat of the disposition and spirit of this time, since the Disparity of those we treat of, will be in that discerned, and the Earl be found by so much to have the advantage, that there will be little need of conferring the particulars of their lives. 'Twas a busie querulous frowardtime, so much degenerated from the purity of the former, that the people under pretences of Reformation, with some petulant discourses of Liberty (which their great Impostors scattered among them, like false glasses to multiply their fears) began</hi> Abditos Principis sensus, &amp; quid occultius parat exquirere: <hi>extended their enquiries even to the Chamber and private actions of the King himself, forgetting that truth of the Poet,</hi>—Nusquam Libertas gratior extat,—quam sub Rege pio: <hi>'Twas strange to see how men afflicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to find out calamities and mischiefs, whilest they borrowed the name of some great persons to scandalize the State they lived in: A general disorder throughout the whole body of the Commonwealth; nay the vital part pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, the Laws violated by the Judges, Religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned by the Prelates, Heresies crept into the Church and countenanced: and yet all this shall be quickly rectified without so much as being beholding to the King, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting with the Clergy.</hi>

                     <hi>There were two errours chiefly laid to his charge, and so eagerly urged, that in them he was almost concluded an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the King and Countrey; which certainly in the next Age will be conceived marvellous strange Objections: the</hi>

                     <hi>one being a strong Argument of his Worth, the other a piece of its Reward: the first was the plurality of Offices, though they were immediately conferred on him by the King, or else such as he was promoted to by his Majesties own allowance, to acquire to the which, there was no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition but his Majesty was a witness, if not a surety for the performance; and yet for the execution of them, never man studied more to apt himself, nor descended to meaner Arts to give general content. And here possibly it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned his Mirth to see his ambition prosecuted of some, who desired to ease him of this Guilt by undertaking his Trust.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The other was the preferment of his Kindred, upon whom his Majesty (delighting to give all gracious expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his affection to the Duke) would (to enliven any branch that grew from the same Stock) confer both Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Living. And this surely had so little significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of offence in the Dukes conscience, that he thought he should have sinned against the Law of Nature, and a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous disposition, that it would have been an eternal brand to his name and memory, if being so seized of this great Kings favour, he had no regard but to his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.</hi>

                     <hi>Now whether the importunate clamour upon these two faults (whereof he found no regret, but comfort in himself) made him so to esteem of the popular discretion, and honesty; or whether he esteemed it the same ignominy to have his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance exalted with blasphemy, as (for attending the Prince out of</hi> Spain) <hi>he was called our Redeemer; or to have his mis-fortunes mistaken into disloyalty, when his</hi>

                     <hi>And here again, he may be said to meet with the Earl, that they both died by the people, though by very different affections, which continued so preposterous, as Iustice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the One (for Iustice is the execution of the Law) was interpreted a Conspiracy; And Treason upon the Other, conceived Religion; And yet one had the Royal Sacrifice of his Soveraigns sorrow, which the other wanted.</hi>

And here the Earl had the day too: For his friends were Skreens between him and envy, and his own infirmities taken from him, and imposed on them; when the Duke was so far from that ease, or being discharged of the burthen that belonged to them, that he was traduced with all the mistakes of all his friends, kindred, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants; as if he were the mischievous Agent, they only improvident and surprized Instruments.</hi>

                     <hi>'Tis true, they were neither of them much skilled in that Paradox of charity,</hi> loving their enemies: <hi>and yet the Dukes easiness to reconcilement, and too soon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the circumstances of Grudges, betrayed him often to the injuries of such as had not the same spirit.</hi>

                     <hi>Concerning the parts and endowments of his Mind, if the consideration of Learning extend it self not further then drudgery in Books, the Dukes imployments forbids to suspect him for any great Scholar: but if a nimble and flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent expression, and delivery of his Mind (and his discourse was of all Subjects) in a natural and proper dialect be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, he was well letter'd: but if he had that Eloquence of Nature or Art, I am sure he wanted that other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, (which the best Iudge attributed to the Earl as an Eloquence that passed the other two) the pity and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his hearers; insomuch that his words and speeches were never entertained with that candour or common cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Interpretation, as civilly belongs to all Delinquents: witness that speech in the fulness of his joy, he let fall to his Majesty in the behalf of his people, which was immediately perverted and carpt at, as an aggravation of his other ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary and fantastick offences.</hi>

                     <hi>In his Liberalities and rewards of those he fancied, he was so chearfully magnificent, and so much at the mercy of his Dependants, that if they proved improvident or immodest in their Suits, the inconveniency and mischief was surely his; insomuch as he seemed wholly possest from himself, and to be only great for their use; and he had then so happy a bravery in deriving of his Favours, and conferred them with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noble circumstances, as the manner was as obliging as the matter, and mens understandings oft-times as much puzled as their gratitude.</hi>

                     <hi>If the Earl sided him here, his bounty fell upon more unthrifty men; for there are many Families owe their large possessions only to the openness of the Dukes hand, though much be lost too in the ingratitudes of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers.</hi>

                     <hi>But that which shined with most lustre in him, and which indeed flowed in his nature much above its proportion in other men, was an admirable affability and gentleness to all men. And this was the pomp and glory of all his Titles; Insomuch as though his Memory were a place so taken up with high thoughts, and unlikely to have any room for matters of so small importance; he was ever known to entertain his young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er acquaintance with that familiarity, as if they had been stairs by which he ascended to his greatness.</hi>

                     <hi>He had besides such a tenderness and compassion in his nature, that such as think the Laws dead if they are not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely executed, censured him for being too merciful; but his charity was grounded upon a wiser Maxime of St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>And now, me thinks, to believe a man drest in all these real ornaments of Honour, could be an Enemy to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, to his Countrey, is as ingenuous as to believe a man of a solemn friendlyness to ten thousand men, and of a resolved hatred to mankind.</hi>

                     <hi>Of all imputations, that was the most unskilful, which accused him of a purpose and design to enrich himself. Certainly that was never in his vows; and possibly the Auditors of his Revenues do not find his Estate so much increased from the time of his first Master, though he enjoyed a glorious Harvest of almost four years, which if it had been brought in to his own use, could not but have made an envious addition.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Determine to write the Life and the End, the Nature and the Fortunes of <hi>GEORGE VILLIERS,</hi> late Duke of <hi>Buckingham:</hi> (esteeming him worthy to be Registred among the great examples of Time and Fortune:) which yet I have not undertaken out of any wanton plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in mine own Pen; nor truly, without often pondering with my self before-hand what Censures I might incur. For I would not be ignorant by long observation, both abroad and at home; That every where all greatness of power and Favour is circumvested with much prejudice. And that it is not easie for Writers to research with due distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (as they ought) in the actions of eminent
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:102693:150"/>
Personages, both how much may have been ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished by the envy of others, and what was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by their own felicity; unless, after the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of their Splendour, which must needs dazle their beholders, and perhaps oftentimes themselves, we could as in some Scenes of the fabulous Age, excite them again, and confer a while with their naked Ghosts. However, for my part, I have no servile or ignoble end in my present labour, which may on either side restrain or embase the freedome of my poor judgement. I will therefore steer as evenly as I can, and deduce him from his Cradle through the deep and lubrick waves of State and Court, till he was swallowed in the Gulf of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
                  <p>I find him born in the year of our Saviour 1592. on the 20th. of <hi>August,</hi> at <hi>Brookeby</hi> in <hi>Leicestershire,</hi> where his Ancestors had chiefly continued about the space of 400 years, rather without obscurity, then with any great lustre, after they had long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been seated in <hi>Kinalton</hi> in the Country of <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham.</hi> He was the third Son of <hi>George Villiers</hi> Knight, and <hi>Mary</hi> late Countess of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and Daughter to <hi>Anthony Beaumont</hi> of <hi>Coleorton,</hi> Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, names on either side well known of Ancient extraction. And yet I remember there was one, who in a wilde Pamphlet which he published, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides other pityful Malignities, would scant allow him to be a Gentleman. He was nurtured where he had been born, in his first Rudiments, till the years of ten; and from thence sent to <hi>Billisden-</hi>School in the same County, where he was taught the principles of Musick, and other slight Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, till the thirteenth of his age; at which time his Father died. Then his beautiful and provident
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:102693:150"/>
Mother, (for those Attributes will not be denyed her) took him home to her house at <hi>Goodby,</hi> where she had him in especial care; so as he was first, (as we may say) a Domestick Favourite: But finding him (as it should seem) by nature little studious and contemplative, she chose rather to endue him with conversative Qualities and Ornaments of youth, as Dancing, Fencing, and the like; Not without aim then, perchance, (though far off) at a Courtiers life: To which lessons, he had such a dexterous proclivity, as his Teachers were fain to restrain his forwardness; to the end that his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who were under the same training, might hold pace with him. About the age of eighteen, he travelled into <hi>France,</hi> where he improved himself well in the Language, for one that had so little Grammatical foundation; but more in the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of that Nobility, for the space of three years, and yet came home in his natural plight, without affected sorms (the ordinary disease of Travellers.) After his return, he passed again one whole year (as before) at <hi>Goodby,</hi> under the Wing and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of his Mother: And then was forward to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Suiter at <hi>London</hi> to Sir <hi>Roger Ashton</hi>'s Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a Gentleman of the Bed-chamber to King <hi>James,</hi> and Master of the Robes. About which times, he falls into intrinsecal society with Sir <hi>John Greham,</hi> then one of the Gentlemen of his Majesties Privy-Chamber: who, I know not upon what Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries he spyed in his face, disswaded him from Marriage, and gave him rather encouragement to wooe Fortune in Court. Which advice sank well into his fancy; for within some while, the King had taken by certain Glances, (whereof the first was at <hi>Apthorpe,</hi> in a Progress) such liking of his
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:102693:151"/>
person, that he resolved to make him a Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, and to mould him, as it were, Platonically to his own <hi>Idea.</hi> Neither was his Majesty content only to be the Architect of his fortune, without putting his Gracious hand likewise to some part of the work it self. Insomuch as it pleased him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, and to avale his goodness, even to the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of his foresaid friend Sir <hi>Iohn Greham</hi> secret directions, how, and by what degrees he should bring him into favour. But this was quickly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by him, who was then as yet in some pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Kings heart. For there is nothing more vigilant, nothing more jealous then a Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, especially towards the wayning time and suspect of saciety. So as many Arts were used to discuss the beginnings of new affection, (which lye out of my Road, being a part of another mans Story.) All which notwithstanding, (for I omit things intervenient) there is conveyed to Mr. <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers</hi> an intimation of the Kings pleasure to wait, and to be sworn his servant; And shortly after, his Cup-bearer at large; And the Summer following he was admitted in Ordinary. After which time Favours came thick upon him, (liker main Show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, then sprinkling Drops or Dews) for the next St. <hi>Georges-</hi>day he was Knighted, and made Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Kings Bed Chamber; and the very same day had an annual Pension given him, for his better support, of one thousand pounds out of the Court of Wards. At <hi>New-years-tide</hi> following, the King chose him Master of the Horse. After this he was installed of the most Noble Order. And in the next <hi>August</hi> he created him Baron of <hi>Whaddon,</hi> and Viscount <hi>Villiers.</hi> In <hi>January</hi> of the same year, he was advanced Earl of <hi>Buckingham,</hi>
                     <pb n="211" facs="tcp:102693:151"/>
and sworn here of his Majesties Privy-Counsel; as if a Favourite vvere not so before. The <hi>March</hi> ensuing, he attended the King into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and vvas likewise sworn a Counsellor in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; vvhere (as I have been instructed by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate men) he did carry himself vvith singular sweetness and temper; vvhich I held very credible, for it behoved him, being new in favour, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding one of their own, to study a moderate style among those generous Spirits. About <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>years-tide</hi> after his return from thence (for those beginnings of years vvere very propitious unto him, as if Kings did chuse remarkable dayes to inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their Favours, that they may appear acts as vvell of the Times, as of the Will) he vvas Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Marquess of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and made Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>England,</hi> Chief Justice in <hi>Eyre</hi> of all the Parks and Forrests on the South-side of <hi>Trent,</hi> Master of the Kings-Bench Office, (none of the unprofitable pieces) Head-Steward of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and Constable of <hi>Windsor-</hi>Castle.</p>
                  <p>Here I must breath a vvhile to satisfie some that perhaps might otherwise vvonder at such an Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of Benefits, like a kind of Embroidering or listing of one Favour upon another. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the hearts of great Princes, if they be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as it vvere in abstract, vvithout the necessity of States, and Circumstances of time, being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their natural extent, moreover, once opened and dilated vvith affection, can take no full and proportionate pleasure in the exercise of any nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Bounty. And albeit at first they give only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on choice and love of the person, yet vvithin a vvhile themselves likewise begin to love their gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, and to foment their deeds, no less then Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:102693:152"/>
do their Children. But let us go on.</p>
                  <p>For these Offices and Dignities already rehears<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and these of the like nature vvhich I shall after set down in their place, vvere (as I am ready to say) but the facings or fringes of his Greatness, in comparison of that trust vvhich his most Gracious Master did cast upon him in the one and twentieth year of his Reign, vvhen he made him the chief Concomitant of his Heir apparent, and only Son, our dear Soveraign, now being, in a journey of much Adventure, and vvhich (to shew the strength of his privacy) had been before not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vvith any other of his Majesties most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served Counsellors at home, being carried vvith great closeness, liker a business of Love then State; as it vvas in the first intendment. Now, because the vvhole Kingdome stood in a zealous trepidation of the absence of such a Prince; I have been the more desirous to research vvith some diligence, the several passages of the said Journey, and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Accidents of any moment in their vvay. They began their motion in the year 1623, on Tuesday the 18th. of <hi>February,</hi> from the Marquess his house of late purchase, at <hi>Newhall</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out vvith disguised Beards, and vvith borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Names of <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Iohn Smith.</hi> And then at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended vvith none, but Sir <hi>Richard Greham,</hi> Master of the Horse to the Marquess, and of inward trust about him. When they passed the River against <hi>Gravesend,</hi> for lack of silver, they vvere fain to give the Ferry-man a piece of two and twenty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, vvhich struck the poor fellow into such a melting tenderness, that so good Gentlemen should be going (for so he suspected) about some quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel beyond Sea, as he could not forbear to acquaint
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:102693:152"/>
the Officers of the Town vvith vvhat had befallen him, vvho sent presently Post for their stay at <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> through vvhich they vvere passed before any intelligence could arrive. On the brow of the Hill beyond that City, they vvere somewhat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed by espying the <hi>French</hi> Embassador, vvith the Kings Coach and other attending him, vvhich made them baulk the beaten Road, and teach Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hackneys to leap Hedges. At <hi>Canterbury,</hi> vvhither some voice (as it should seem) vvas run on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Mayor of the Town came himself to seize on them, as they vvere taking fresh Horses, in a blunt manner, alledging first a Warrant to stop them from the Councel, next from Sir <hi>Lewis Lewk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> Master of the Ceremonies, and lastly from Sir <hi>Henry Manwaring,</hi> then Lieutenant of <hi>Dover-</hi>Castle. At all vvhich confused fiction, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess had no leasure to laugh, but thought best to dismask his Beard, and so told him, that he vvas going covertly vvith such slight company, to take a secret view (being: Admiral) of the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Majesties Fleet, vvhich vvas then in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration on the Narrow Seas: This, vvith much ado, did somewhat handsomely heal the disguise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. On the vvay afterwards, the Baggage Post-Boy, vvho had been at Court, got (I know not how) a glimmering vvho they vvere; but his mouth vvas easily shut. To <hi>Dover,</hi> through bad Horses, and those pretty impediments, they came not before six at night; vvhere they found Sir <hi>Francis Cottington,</hi> then Secretary to the Prince, now Baron of <hi>Hanworth,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Endymion Porter,</hi> vvho had been sent before to provide a Vessel for their Transportation. The foresaid Knight vvas conjoyn'd, for the nearness of his place, on the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:102693:153"/>
Princes affairs; and for his long Residence in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> vvhere he had gotten singular credit even vvith that cautious Nation, by the temper of his Carriage. Mr. <hi>Porter</hi> vvas taken in, not only as a Bed-chamber servant of Confidence to his Highness, but likewise as a necessary and useful Instrument, for his natural skil in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Tongue. And these five vvere at the first the vvhole <hi>Parada</hi> of this Journey. The next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the night vvas tempestuous, on the 19th. of the foresaid Moneth, taking ship at <hi>Dover</hi> about six of the Clock, they landed the same day at <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>yn</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> near two hours after Noon; reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Monstruell</hi> that night (like men of dispatch;) and <hi>Paris</hi> the second day after, being Friday the one and twentieth. But some three Posts before, they had met vvith two <hi>German</hi> Gentlemen that came newly from <hi>England,</hi> vvhere they had seen at <hi>New-market</hi> the Prince and the Marquess taking Coach together vvith the King, and retaining such a strong impression of them both, that they now bewrayed some knowledge of their persons; but vvere out-faced by Sir <hi>Richard Greham,</hi> vvho vvould needs perswade them they vvere mistaken. Which in truth is no very hard matter, for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry strangeness of the thing it self; and almost the impossibility to conceive so great a Prince and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite so suddenly Metamorphosed into Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, vvith no greater train, vvas enough to make any man living unbelieve his five senses. And this, I suppose, next the assurance of their own vvell resolved Carriage against a new accident, to have been their best Anchor in all such Incounters. At <hi>Paris</hi> the Prince spent one vvhole day to give his mind some contentment in viewing of a famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:102693:153"/>
and Court, vvhich vvas a Neighbour to his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Estates. But for the better vailing of their Visages, his Highness and the Marquess bought each of them a Perriwig, somewhat to over-shadow their fore heads. Of the King they got a sight af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dinner in a Gallery, vvhere he vvas solacing himself vvith familiar pleasures. And of the Queen-Mother as she vvas at her own Table; in neither place descryed, no not by <hi>Monsieur Cadinet,</hi> vvho saw them in both, and had been lately Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour in <hi>England.</hi> Towards Evening, by a meer chance, in appearance, though under-lined vvith a Providence, they had a full sight of the Queen <hi>Infanta,</hi> and of the Princess <hi>Henrietta Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> vvith other great Ladies, at the practise of a Masquing Dance, vvhich vvas then in preparation; having over-heard two Gentlemen vvho vvere ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding towards that sight, after vvhom they pressed, and vvere let in by the Duke <hi>De Mont Bason,</hi> the Queens Lord Chamberlain, out of humanity to strangers, vvhen divers of the <hi>French</hi> vvent by Note here, even vvith the point of a Diamond, by vvhat oblique steps, and inimaginable prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, the high Disposer of Princes Affections doth sometimes contrive the secrets of his vvill. For by this casual curiosity, it fell out, that vvhen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Marriage came in motion between our Soveraign Lord, and the aforesaid most Amiable Princess; it must needs be (howsoever unknown) no small spur to the Treaty, that she hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been altogether a stranger to his Eye.</p>
                  <p>From the next day, vvhen they departed at three of the Clock in the morning from <hi>Paris,</hi> the 23. of <hi>February,</hi> vvere spent six dayes to <hi>Bayon,</hi> the last Town of <hi>France,</hi> having before at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi>

bought them five riding-Coats, all of one colour and fashion, in a kind of Noble simplicity: Where Sir <hi>Francis Cottington</hi> was imployed in a fair manner to keep them from being entertained by the Duke <hi>De Espernon,</hi> telling him they were Gentlemen of mean degree, and formed yet to little Courtship; who perchance might otherwise (being himself no superficial man in the practices of the World) have pierced somewhat deeper then their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.</p>
                  <p>They were now entred into the deep time of Lent, and could get no flesh in their Innes. Whereupon fell out a pleasant passage (if I may insert it by the way among more serious:) There was near <hi>Bayon,</hi> an Herd of Goats with their young ones, upon which sight, the said Sir <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Greham</hi> tells the Marquess, he would snap one of the Kids, and make some shift to carry him close to their lodging. Which the Prince over-hearing, Why <hi>Richard,</hi> sayes he, do you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>st gave the Goat Herd good contentment, and then while the Marquess and his servant (being both on foot) were chasing the Kid about the stack, the Prince from Horse back killed him in the Head with a <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Pistol. Set this Fear for a Journal Parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, which yet may shew how his Highness even in such slight and sportful damage had a Noble sense of just dealing.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Bayon,</hi> the Count <hi>De Gramont,</hi> Governour of that jealous Key, took an exquisite notice of their persons and behaviour, and opened himself to some of his train, That he thought them to be Gentlemen of much more worth then their habits
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:102693:154"/>
bewrayed; yet he let them courteously pass. And four dayes after they arrived at <hi>Madrid,</hi> being <hi>Wednesday</hi> the fifth of <hi>March.</hi> Thus have I briefly run over transcursions, as if my Pen had been post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them. Which done, I shall not need to relate the affluence of young Nobles and others from hence into <hi>Spain,</hi> after the voice of our Prince his being there had been quickly noised, and at length believed; neither will I stay to consider the Arts of <hi>Rome,</hi> where now all Engines were whetted (though by the Divine blessing very vainly) when they had gotten a Prince of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> upon Catholick ground, as they use to call it.</p>
                  <p>This, and the whole matter of Negotiation there, the open entertainments, the secret work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Apprehensions on both sides, the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on neither; And in summe, all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and respect of Religion and State intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in that commixture, will better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Royal History, or a Councel-Table, then a single Life. Yet I cannot omit some things which intervened at the meeting of two <hi>Pleiades,</hi> me thinks not unlike that which Astrologers call a Conjunction of Planets, of no very benign Aspect the one to the other; I mean, the Marquess of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the <hi>Conde d'Olivares.</hi> They had some sharper, and some milder differences, which might easily happen in such an intervene of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees both vehement on the parts which they swayed. But the most remarkable was upon a supposition of the <hi>Condes,</hi> (as fancies are cheap) that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess had intimated unto her some hopes of the Prince his Conversion; which coming into debate, the Marquess so roundly disavowed this guilded dream, as <hi>Olivares</hi> alledged he had given him <hi>La-Mentida,</hi>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:102693:155"/>
and thereupon forms: a Complement to the Prince himself; which <hi>Buckingham</hi> denying, and yet <hi>Olivares</hi> persisting in the said Complement, the Marquess, though now in strange hands, yet seeing both his Honour and the Truth at stake, was not tender likewise to engage his life, but replyed with some heat, that the <hi>Condes</hi> asseveration would force him to do that which he had not done before; for now he held himself tyed in terms of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to maintain the contrary to his affirmative in any sort whatsoever. This was the highest and the harshest point that occurred between them; which that it went so far, was not the Dukes fault; nor his fault neither, (as it should seem) that it went no further.</p>
                  <p>There was another memorable passage one day of gentler quality, and yet eager enough. The <hi>Conde d' Olivares</hi> tells the Marquess of a certain flying noise, that the Prince did plot to be secretly gone: To which the Marquess gave a well temper'd an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that though Love had made his Highness steal out of his own Countrey, yet Fear would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make him run out of <hi>Spain</hi> in other manner then should become a Prince of his Royal and generous Vertues.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Spain</hi> they stayed near eight entire moneths, during all which times, who but <hi>Buckingham</hi> lay at home under millions of maledictions? Which yet, at the Prince his safe arrival in the <hi>West,</hi> did die, and vanish here and there into praises and Elogies, according to the contrary motions of popular waves. And now to summe up the fruit of the Journey, discourses ran thus among the clearest Observers. It was said, that the Prince himself, without any imaginable stain of his Religion, had
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:102693:155"/>
by the sight of Forraign Courts, and observations of the different Natures of people, and Rules of Government, much excited and awaked his spirits, and corroborated his judgement. And as for the Marquess, there was note taken of two great addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which he had gained: First, he was returned with encrease of Title, having there been made Duke, by Patent sent him, which was the highest degree whereof an <hi>English</hi> Subject could be capable. But the other was far greater, though closer; for by so long and so private; and so various consoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with a Prince of such excellent nature, he had now gotten as it were two lives in his own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and Greatness; whereas otherwise the estate of a Favourite is at the best but a Tenant at will, and rarely transmitted. But concerning the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Commission, which in publick conceit was the main scope of the Journey, that was left in great suspence, and after some time utterly laid aside; which threw the Duke amongst free Wits (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have a rank Soil) under divers Censures. The most part were apt to believe, that he had brought down some deep distaste from <hi>Spain,</hi> which exasperated his Councels; Neither was there wanting some other, that thought him not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther void of a little Ambition, to shew his power either to knit or dissolve. Howsoever, the whole Scene of affairs was changed from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>France;</hi> there now lay the prospective. Which alteration being generally liked, and all alterations of State being ever attributed to the powerfullest under Princes (as the manner is where the eminency of one obscureth the rest;) the Duke became sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and strangely Gracious among the multitude, and was even in Parliament highly exalted; so as
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:102693:156"/>
he did seem for a time to have overcome that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Incompatibility, which in the experience of all Ages hath been noted between the Vulgar and the Soveraign Favour. But this was no more then a meer bubble or blast, and like an Ephemeral fit of applause, as estsoon will appear in the sequel and train of his life. I had almost forgotten, that after his return from <hi>Spain,</hi> he was made Lord Warden of the Cinque-Ports, (which is as it were a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Admiralty) and Steward likewise of the Mannour of <hi>Hampton-</hi>Court; Dignities and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces still growing of trust or profit: And the King now giving not only out of a beneficent dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, but a very habitual and confirmed cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome.</p>
                  <p>One year, six moneths, two dayes after the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reception of the Prince his Son from <hi>Spain,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> of immortal memory (among all the lovers and admirers of Divine and Humane Sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) accomplished at <hi>Theobalds</hi> his own dayes on Earth. Under whom the Duke had run a long Course of calm and smooth prosperity: I mean long, for the ordinary life of favour; and the more notable, because it had been without any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Eclipse or Wave in himself, amidst divers va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations in others.</p>
                  <p>The most important and pressing care of a new and Vigorous King, was his Marriage, for medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate establishment of the Royal Line. Wherein the Duke having had an especial hand, he was sent to conduce hither the most Lovely and Vertuous Princess <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> youngest Daughter to the Great <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> of whom his Majesty (as hath been said) had an ambulatory view in his Travels, (like a stolen taste of something that
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:102693:156"/>
provoketh appetite.) He was accompanied with none of our Peers but the Earl of <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> now Lord Chamberlain, a Noble Gentleman, of trusty, free, and open nature; and truly no unsuitable Associate, for that he himself likewise, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of King <hi>James,</hi> had run his Circle in the wheeling vicissitude of Favour.</p>
                  <p>And here I must crave leave in such of high qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or other of particular note, as shall fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my pen, (whereof this is the first) not to let them pass without their due Character, being part of my professed ingenuity.</p>
                  <p>Now this Ambassy, though it had a private shew, being charged with more formality then matter, (for all the essential Conditions were before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded) could howsoever want no Ornaments, or bravery to adorn it. Among which, I am near thinking it worthy of a little remembrance, that the Duke, one solemn day, Gorgeously clad in a suit all over-spread with Diamonds, and having lost one of them of good value, perchance as he might be dancing, after his manner, with lofty motion, it was strangely recovered again the next morning in a Court full of Pages: Such a diligent attendant was Fortune every where, both abroad and at home.</p>
                  <p>After this fair discharge, all Civil Honours having showred on him before, there now fell out great occasions to draw forth his spirits into acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a breach first with <hi>Spain,</hi> and not longafter with <hi>France</hi> it self, notwithstanding so streight an affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, so lately treated with the one, and actually accomplished with the other. As if indeed (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that pleasant Maxime of State) Kingdoms were never married. This must of necessity involve
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:102693:157"/>
the Duke in business enough to have over-set a lesser Vessel, being the next Commander under the Crown, of Ports and Ships.</p>
                  <p>But he was noted willingly to embrace those O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures of publick employment. For at the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> his Youth and want of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in Maritime service, had somewhat been shrewdly touched, even before the sluces and flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of popular liberty were yet set open. So as to wipe out that objection, he did now mainly attend his charge, by his Majesties untroubled and serene Commands, even in a tempestuous time. Now the men fell a rubbing of Armour, which a great while had layn oyled: The Magazines of Munition are viewed: The Officers of Remains called to account: frequent Councels of War, as many private confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences with expert Sea-men, a Fleet in preparation for some attempt upon <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke himself personally imployed to the States General; and with him joyned in full Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> a Peer both of singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar grace and solidity, and of all sweet and service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able virtue for publick use.</p>
                  <p>These two Nobles, after a dangerous passage from <hi>Harwich,</hi> wherein three of their Ships were foundred, arrived the fifth day at the <hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi> Here they were to enter a treaty, both with the States themselves, and with the Ministers of divers allied and confederate Princes, about a common diversion, for the recovery of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> where the King's only Sisters Dowry had been ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished by the <hi>German Eagle,</hi> mixed with <hi>Spanish</hi> Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: A Princess resplendent in darkness, and whose virtues were born within the chance, but without the power of Fortune.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:102693:157"/>
Here it were injurious to over-slip a Noble act in the Duke during this Imployment, which I must, for my part, celebrate above all his Expences: There was a Collection of certain rare Manuscripts, exquisitely written in Arabick, and sought in the most remote parts by the diligence of <hi>Erpenius,</hi> the most excellent Linguist: These had been left to the Widow of the said <hi>Erpenius,</hi> and were upon sale to the <hi>Iesuits</hi> at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> liquorish Chapmen of such Ware. Whereof the Duke, getting knowledge by his worthy and learned Secretary Doctor <hi>Mason,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terverted the bargain, and gave the poor Widow for them five hundred pounds, a sum above their weight in silver, and a mixed act both of bounty and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the more laudable, being out of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Element. These were they, which after his death were as Nobly presented, as they had been bought, to the University of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> by the Dutchess Dowager, as soon as she understood, by the aforesaid Doctor <hi>Mason,</hi> her Husband's inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who had a purpose likewise (as I am well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed) to raise in the said University (whereof he was Chancellor) a fair Case for such Monuments, and to furnish it with other choice Collections from all parts, of his own charge: perchance in some emulation of that famous Treasury of knowledge at <hi>Oxford,</hi> without parallel in the Christian World. But let me resume the file of my Relation, which this Object of Books (best agreeable to my course of life) hath a little interrupted.</p>
                  <p>The aforesaid Negotiation, though prosecuted with heat and probable appearance of great effects, took up a Month before the Duke's return from his excentricity, (for so I account Favorites abroad) and then at home he met no good news of the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:102693:158"/>
                     <hi>Cadiz</hi> attempt. In the preparation thereof, though he had spent much solicitude <hi>ex officio,</hi> yet it prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally failed (as was thought) by late setting out, and by some contrariety of Weather at Sea; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the particular design took vent before hand, a point hardly avoidable in actions of noise, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where the great <hi>Indian</hi> Key to all Cabinets is working.</p>
                  <p>Not long after this, the King pondering in his Wisdom the weight of his Forreign Affairs, found it fit to call a Parliament at <hi>Westminster:</hi> this was that Assembly, where there appeared a sudden and marvellous conversion in the Duke's Case, from the most exalted, (as he had been both in another Parliament, and in common Voice before) to the most depressed now; as if his condition had been capable of no Mediocrities. And it could not but trouble him the more, by happening when he was so freshly returned out of the <hi>Low-Country Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> out of a meritorious employment, in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conceit and hope. Which being the single example that our Annals have yielded, from the time of <hi>William de la Pool,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> under <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, of such a concurrence of two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, withinso short time, by most of the same Commenders and Disprovers, (like the natural breath of man, that can both heat and cool) would require no sleight memorial of the particular Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of so great a change, but that the whole Case was dispersed by the Knights of Shires, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses of Towns, through all the Veins of the Land, and may be taken by any, at pleasure, out of the Parliament Registers. Besides that, I observe it not usual among the best patterns, to stuff the report of particular lives with matter of publick
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:102693:158"/>
record, but rather to dive (as I shall endeavour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I wipe my Pen) into secret and proper afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; howsoever, somewhat I must note in this strange <hi>Phainomenon.</hi> It began from a travelled Doctor of Physick, of bold spirit, and of able Elocution; who being returned one of the Burgesses (which was not ordinary in any of his Coat) fell by a Metaphorical Allusion) translated from his own Faculty, to propound the Duke's as a main cause of divers infirmities in the State, or near that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; being sure enough of Seconds, after the first On-set, in the Lower House. As for any close in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that they had before hand with some in the Higher, (though that likewise was said) I want ground to affirm, or believe it more then a general conceit; which perhaps might run of the working of envy amongst those that were nearest the object, which we see so familiar, both in natural and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral causes. The Duke's Answers to his Appeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in number thirteen, I find very diligently and civilly couched: and though his heart was big, yet they all savour of an humble spirit, one way, equitable consideration, which could not but pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess every vulgar conceit, and somewhat allay the whole matter, that in the bolting and sifting of near fourteen years of such power and favour, all that came out, could not be expected to be pure and white, and fine Meal, but must needs have withal among it a certain mixture of <hi>Padar</hi> and <hi>Bran,</hi> in this lower age of humane fragility. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever this Tempest did only shake, and not rent his Sails. For his Majesty considering that almost all his Appeachments were without the compass of his own Reign; and moreover, That nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged against him, had, or could be proved by
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:102693:159"/>
Oath, according to the Constitution of the House of Commons; which the Duke himself did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in the Preface of his Answers. And lastly, having had such experience of his fidelity, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance abroad, where he was chief in trust, and in the participations of all hazards, found himself engaged in honour, and in the sense of his own natural goodness, to support him at home from any further inquietude, and too dear buy his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est testimonies of divers important imputations, whereof the truth is best known to his Majesty while he was Prince.</p>
                  <p>The Summer following this Parliament (after an Embarque of our Trading Ships in the River of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and other points of Sovereign affront) there did succeed the action of <hi>Rheez,</hi> wherein the Duke was personally imployed on either Element, both as Admiral and General, with hope in that service to recover the publick good will, which he saw by his own example might quickly be won and lost. This action, as I hear, hath been delivered by a Noble Gentleman of much learning, and active spirits, himself the fitter to do it right, which in truth it greatly wanted, having found more honourable censure, even from some of the <hi>French</hi> Writers, then it had generally amongst our selves at home.</p>
                  <p>Now, because the said work is not yet flowing into the light, I will but sweep the way with a few notes, and these only touching the Duke's own deportment in that Island, the proper subject of my quill; for in the general survey of this action, there was matter of glory and grief so equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed on both sides, as if Fortune had meant we should quickly be Friends again. Wherein let their
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:102693:159"/>
names that were bravely lost, be rather memorized in the full table of time; for my part, I love no ambitious pains in an eloquent description of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series. The Duke's carriage was surely Noble throughout: to the Gentlemen of fair respect, boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful to the Souldier, according to any special value which he spied in any, tender and careful of those that were hurt, of unquestionable Courage in himself, and rather fearful of Fame, then Danger: In his countenance, which is the part that all eyes interpret, no open alteration, even after the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours which he expected did fail him; but the less he shewed without, the more it wrought intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, according to the nature of suppressed passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For certain it is, that to his often mentioned Secretary, Doctor <hi>Mason,</hi> whom he laid in Pallet near him, for natural Ventilation of his thoughts, he would, in the absence of all other ears and eyes, break out into bitter and passionate Eruptions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing, That never his Dispatches to divers Princes, nor the great business of a Fleet, of an Army, of a Siege, of a Treaty, of War, of Peace, both on foot together, and all of them in his head at a time, did not so much break his repose, as a conceit, That some at home, under his Majesty, of whom he had well deserved, were now content to forget him; but whom he meant, I know not, and am loth to rove at conjectures.</p>
                  <p>Of their two Forts, he could not take the one, nor would he take the other; but in the general Town he maintained a seisure and possession of the whole three full months, and eighteen days; and at the first descent on shore, he was not immured within a wooden Vessel, but he did countenance the landing in his long Boat. Where succeeded
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:102693:160"/>
such a defeat of near two hundred Horse (and these not (by his ghess) mounted in haste, but the most part Gentlemen of Family, and great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution) seconded with two thousand Foot, as all circumstances well ballanced on either side, may surely endure a comparison with any of the bravest Impressions in ancient time. In the issue of the whole business, he seems charged in opinion with a kind of improvident conscience, having brought of that with him to Camp, perchance, too much from a Court, where Fortune had never deceived him: Besides, we must consider him yet but rude in the profession of Arms, though greedy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and zealous in the Cause.</p>
                  <p>At his return to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> a strange accident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell him, perchance not so worthy of memory for it self, as for that it seemeth to have been a kind of prelude to his final period.</p>
                  <p>The now Lord <hi>Goring,</hi> a Gentleman of true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and of vigilant affections for his Friend, sends to the Duke, in all expedition, an express Messenger, with advisement to assure his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, by declining the ordinary Road to <hi>London,</hi> for that he had credible Intelligence of a plot against his life, to be put in execution upon him in his said journey towards the Court. The Duke meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Messenger on the way, read the Letter, and smothering it in his pocket, without the least ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable apprehension, rides forwards; His company being about that time not above seven or eight in number, and those no otherwise provided for their defence, then with ordinary swords. After this, the Duke had advanced three miles before he met with an old Woman, near a Town in the Road, who demanded, Whether the Duke were in the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:102693:160"/>
company? and bewraying some especial occasion to be brought to him, was lead to his Horse-side; where she told him, that in the very next Town where he was to pass, she had heard some despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men vow his death: And thereupon would have directed him about by a surer way. This old Womans casual access, joyn'd with that deliberate advertisement which he had before from his Noble Friend, moved him to participate both the tenour of the said Letter, and all the circumstances, with his Company; who were joyntly upon consent, that the Woman had advised him well. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all which importunity, he resolved not to wave his way upon this reason, perhaps more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous then provident, that if, as he said, he should but once, by such a diversion, make his Enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he were afraid of danger, he should never live without. Hereupon his young Nephew, Lord Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Fielding,</hi> being then in his Company, out of a Noble spirit, besought him, that he would at least honour him with his Coat, and blew Ribbon thorow the Town, pleading that his Uncle's life, whereon lay the property of his whole Family, was of all things under Heaven the most precious unto him; and undertaking so to gesture and muffle up himself in his hood, as the Duke's manner was to ride in cold weather, that none should discern him from him; and so he should be at the more liberty for his own defence. At which sweet Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, the Duke caught him in his arms, and kissed him; yet would not, as he said, accept of such an offer in that case from a Nephew, whose life he tendred as much as himself; and so liberally rewarded the poor Creature for her good will. After some short directions to his Company, how
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:102693:161"/>
they should carry themselves, he rode on without perturbation of his mind. He was no sooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Town, but a scambling Souldier clapt hold of his bridle, which he thought was in a begging, or (perchance somewhat worse) in a drunken fashion; yet a Gentleman of his train that rode a pretty distance behind him, conceiving by the premisses it might be a beginning of some mischievous intent, spurred up his Horse, and with a violent rush severed him from the Duke, who with the rest went on quickly through the Town: neither, for ought I can hear, was there any further enquiry into that practice, the Duke peradventure thinking it wisdome not to resent dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentments too deep.</p>
                  <p>At his return to the Court he found no change in Faces, but smothered murmurings for the loss of so many gallant Gentlemen; against which his friends did oppose in their discourses the chance of War, together with a gentle expectation for want of supply in time.</p>
                  <p>After the complaints in Parliament, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate issue at <hi>Rheez,</hi> the Dukes fame did still remain more and more in obloquy among the mass of people, whose judgements are only reconciled with good successes: so as he saw plainly that he must abroad again to rectifie by his best endeavour under the publick Service, his own reputation. Whereupon new preparatives were in hand, and partly reparatives of the former beaten at Sea. And in the mean while, he was not unmindfull in his civil course, to cast an eye upon the wayes, to win unto him such as have been of principal credit in the Lower House of Parliament, applying leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, or subducting from that part where he knew
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:102693:161"/>
the humors were sharpest: amidst which thoughts, he was surprized with a fatal stroke, written in the black Book of necessity.</p>
                  <p>There was a younger Brother of mean fortunes, born in the County of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> by name <hi>Iohn Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> by nature of a deep melancholy, silent and gloomy constitution, but bred in the active way of a Souldier: and thereby raised to the place of Lieutenant, to a Foot-Company, in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sir <hi>Iames Ramsey.</hi> This was the man that closely within himself had conceived the Dukes death. But what may have been the immediate or greatest motive of that fellonious conception, is even yet in the Clouds.</p>
                  <p>It was said at first, that he had been stung with a denial of his Captains place, who died in <hi>England;</hi> whereof thus much indeed is true, that the Duke, before he would invest him in the said place, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing first (as his manner was) with his Colonel; he found him to interpose for one <hi>Powel,</hi> his own Lieutenant, a Gentleman of extraordinary valour, and according to Military custome, the place was good, that the Lieutenant of the Colonels Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany might well pretend to the next vacant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainship under the same Regiment. Which <hi>Felton</hi> acknowledged to be in it self very usual and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, besides the special merit of the person. So as the aforesaid conceit of some rancour harboured upon this denial had no true ground. There was another imagination, that between a Knight of the same County (whom the Duke had lately taken into some good degree of favour) and the said <hi>Felton,</hi> there had been ancient quarrels not yet well healed, which might perhaps lye festring in his brest, and by a certain inflammation produce this
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:102693:162"/>
effect. But that carries small probability, that <hi>Felton</hi> would so deface his own act, as to make the Duke no more then an oblique sacrifice to the fumes of his private revenge upon a third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the truth is, that either to honest a deed after it was done, or to slumber his conscience in the doing, he studied other incentives, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not three hours before his execution, to Sir <hi>Richard Gresham,</hi> two only inducements thereof. The first, as he made it in order, was a certain li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellous Book written by one <hi>Egglestone</hi> a <hi>Scottish</hi> Physician, which made the Duke one of the foulest Monsters upon the earth; and indeed, unworthy not only of life in a Christian Court, and under so vertuous a King; but of any room within the bounds of all humanity, if his prodigious predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>d the least semblance of truth. The second, was, the Remonstrance it self of the Lower House of Parliament, against him, which perchance he thought the fairest cover, so he put in the second place. Whatsoever were the true motive, which I think none can determine but the Prince of darkness it self; he did thus prosecute the effect.</p>
                  <p>In a by-Cutlers Shop on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> he bought a ten penny Knife (so cheap was the instrument of this great attempt) and the sheath thereof he sew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the lining of his Pocket, that he might at any moment draw forth the Blade alone with one hand, for he had maimed the other. This done, he made shift, partly, as it is said, on Horse-back, and partly on foot, to get to <hi>Portsmouth;</hi> for he was indigent and low in money, which perhaps might have a little edged his desperation. At <hi>Portsmouth</hi>
                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:102693:162"/>
on Saturday, being the 23. of <hi>August</hi> of that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant year, he pressed without any suspicion in such a time of so many pretenders to Imployment, into an inward Chamber, where the Duke was at break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast (the last of his repasts in this world) accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with men of quality and action, with <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de Soubes,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Fryer.</hi> And there a little before the Dukes rising from the Table, he went and stood expecting till he should pass through a kind of Lobby between that Room and the next, where were divers attending him. Towards which passage, as I conceive, somewhat darker then the Chamber which he voided, while the Duke came with Sir <hi>Thomas Fryer</hi> close at his ear, in the very moment as the said Knight withdrew himself from the Duke, this Assasinate gave him with a back blow a deep wound into his left side, leaving the Knife in his body. Which the Duke himself pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, on a sudden effusion of spirits, he sunk down under the Table in the next Room, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately expired.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is, that some good while before, Sir <hi>Clement Throckmorton,</hi> a Gentleman then living, of grave judgement, had in a private conference ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised him to wear a Privy-Coat, whose Counsel the Duke received very kindly; but gave him this answer, That against any popular fury, a Shirt of Mayl would be but a silly defence; and as for any single mans assault, he took himself to be in no danger. So dark is Destiny.</p>
                  <p>One thing in this enormous accident, is, I must confess, to me beyond all wonder, as I received it from a Gentleman of judicious and diligent obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and one whom the Duke well favoure That within the space of not many minutes after<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

fall of the body, and removal thereof into the first Room, there was not a living creature in either of the Chambers, no more then if it had lien in the Sands of <hi>Aethiopia;</hi> whereas commonly, in such cases, you shall note every where a great and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den conflux of people unto the place, to hearken, and to see. But it should seem the very horrour of the fact had stupified all curiosity, and so dispersed the multitude, that it is thought even the murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er himself might have escaped (for who gave the blow, none could affirm) if he had not lingred about the House below, not by any confused ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of conscience, as hath been seen in like exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but by very pride in his own deed, as if in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect there were little difference between being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by a vertuous fame, or an illustrious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy.</p>
                  <p>Thus died this great Peer, in the 36 year of his age compleat, and three dayes over, in a time of great recourse unto him, and dependance upon him, the House, and Town full of Servants and Suiters, his Dutchess in an upper Room, scarce yet out of her Bed; and the Court at that time not above six or nine miles from him, which had been the Stage of his Greatness.</p>
                  <p>I have spent some enquiry whether he had any ominous presagement before his end. Wherein though both ancient and modern Stories have been infected with much vanity; yet oftentimes things fall out of that kind which may bear a sober con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, whereof I will glean two or three in the Dukes Case.</p>
                  <p>Being to take his leave of my Lords Grace of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> whom he knew well planted in the Kings unchangeable affection by
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:102693:163"/>
his own great abilities; after courtesies of course had passed between them: My Lord, sayes the Duke, I know your Lordship hath very worthily good accesses unto the King our Soveraign, let me pray you to put his Majesty in mind to be good, as I no wayes distrust, to my poor Wife and Children. At which words, or at his countenance in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, or at both, my Lord Bishop being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what troubled, took the freedome to ask him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had never any secret abodement in his mind. No (replyed the Duke) but I think some adventure may kill me as well as another man.</p>
                  <p>The very day before he was slain, feeling some indisposition of body, the King was pleased to give him the honour of a visit, and found him in his Bed; where, and after much serious and private discourse, the Duke at his Majesties departing, embraced him in a very unusual and passionate manner, and in like sort his friend the Earl of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as if his soul had divined he should see them no more: which infusions towards fatal ends, had been observed by some Authors of no light Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                  <p>On the very day of his death, the Countess of <hi>Denbigh</hi> received a Letter from him; whereunto all the while she was writing her answer, she bedewed the Paper with her tears; And after a most bitter passion (whereof she could yield no reason, but that her dearest Brother was to be gone) she fell down in a swound. Her said Letter ended thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will pray for your happy return, which I look at with a great cloud over my head, too heavy for my poor heart to bear without torment; but I hope the great God of Heaven will bless you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:102693:164"/>
The day following, the Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> her devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted friend, who was thought the fittest preparer of her mind to receive such a doleful accident, came to visit her; but hearing she was at rest, he attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till she should awake of her self, which she did with the affrightment of a dream, <hi>Her Brother seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pass thorow a field with her in her Coach; where hearing a sudden shout of the people, and asking the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, it was answered to have been for joy that the Duke of</hi> Buckingham <hi>was sick.</hi> Which natural impression she scarce had related unto her Gentlewoman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Bishop was entred into her Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber for a chosen Messenger of the Dukes death.</p>
                  <p>This is all that I dare present of that nature to any of judgement, not unwillingly omitting cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain prognostick Anagrams, and such strains of fancy.</p>
                  <p>He took to Wife, eight years and two moneths before his death, the Lady <hi>Katherine Manners,</hi> Heir general to the Noble House of <hi>Rutland;</hi> who besides a solid addition to his Estate, brought him three Sons and a Daughter, called the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> his first born; his eldest Son died at Nurse, before his Journey at <hi>Rheez;</hi> and his third, the Lord <hi>Francis,</hi> was born after his Fathers death; so as neither his first nor his last were participant of any sense of his misfortunes or felicities: His second Son, now Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> was born to chear him after his return from that unlucky Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
                  <p>For these sweet pledges, and no less for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable vertues of her Person and Mind, he loved her dearly, and well expressed his love in an act and time of no simulation towards his end, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathing
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:102693:164"/>
her all his Mansion-houses during her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life, and a power to dispose of his whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Estate, together with a fourth part of his Lands in joynture: He left his elder Brother of the same womb a Viscount, and his younger an Earl; Sir <hi>Edward Villiers,</hi> his half Brother on the Fathers side, he either preferred or removed (call it how you will) from his step-mothers eye to the Presidentship, where he lived in singular estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for his justice and hospitality; and died with as much grief of the whole Province, as ever any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour did (before his religious Lady of sweet and Noble disposition) adding much to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The eldest of the Brethren, and Heir of the Name, was made a Baronet, but abstained from Court, enjoying perhaps the greater Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of self-fruition.</p>
                  <p>He left his Mother a Countess by Patent, in her own person, which was a new leading example, grown before somewhat rare, since the dayes of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> His Sister of <hi>Denbigh</hi> (that right character of a good Lady) he most humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the Queen; who after a discharge of some <hi>French</hi> in her Court that were to return, took her into three several places of honour and trust.</p>
                  <p>In short, not to insist upon every particular Branch of those private preferments, he left all his female kindred, of the entire or half blood, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending of the Name of <hi>Villiers</hi> or <hi>Beaumont,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any near degree, either matched with Peers of the Realm actually, or hopefully with Earls Sons and Heirs; or at least with Knights, or Doctors of Divinity, and of plentifull condition: He did not much strengthen his own subsistence in Court,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:102693:165"/>
but stood there on his own feet, for the truth is, the most of his Allies rather leaned upon him, then shoared him up.</p>
                  <p>His familiar servants, either about his person in ordinary attendance, or about his affairs of State, as his Secretaries; or of Office, as his Steward; or of Law, as that worthy Knight whom he long used to solicite his Causes; He lest all both in good Fortune, and, which is more, in good Fame.</p>

and conference of Counsels and Plots toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then of any rupture, or disunion at hand: So short-sighted is that which we call humane Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and so easily can the Supream Mover de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude our Imaginations.

                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore, having undertaken for some enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of my private time, to compile out of the best of Ancient Memories, that mighty <hi>Action</hi> which anon under these two <hi>Chiefs</hi> involved almost the whole World, then known, I impute it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, to take first a short view how they stood before hand in <hi>Parallel</hi> together.</p>
                     <p>They were both, in general, esteemed of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons too strong for their own, or the common Quiet: That the one could not endure a Superior, nor the other an Equal; we are told both in Prose and in Verse, by ingenious Authors: But whether they agreed to leave us a draught of the greatness, or of the weakness of their Minds, I dare not affirm; some seeming Magnanimities being indeed (if you found them well) at the bottom, very Impotencies. Certainly, in sober conceit, howsoever they stood
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:102693:167"/>
towards other, they were impatient of all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison or approach between themselves; and of their former nearness, no fruit remaining but this, That the more inwardly they had then studied and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood each other, they now loved the less. For point of invading the Soveraignty, such narrow Humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists as could look through them, thought <hi>Pompey</hi> of the two, rather the closer, then the better. For <hi>Caesar</hi>'s was not a smothered, but a flagrant Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, kindling first by Nature, and blown by Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity; in the course whereof one might observe a kind of Circular Motion: for as his vast Desires had exhausted him with unmeasureable gifts above private Condition; so again, when he was grown (as he would often sport with himself in earnest) a great deal worth less then nothing: He fell next to resolve (by an usual Coincidence of extreams) that he could not subsist, unless he were Master of all. In their practical ways <hi>Pompey</hi> had one very ignoble custom, to insert, or (as I may term it) to inoculate himself into other mens merits and praises: So he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined <hi>Lucullus</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>Metellus</hi> in <hi>Spain:</hi> the first a wise and magnificent, the other a good plain Souldier-like Gentleman. But on the other side, all that went for good or bad in <hi>Caesar,</hi> was clearly his own; having so little need to borrow from any other virtues, or vices, that he left it a Doubt among the best Wits of his time, whether of which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had most, in the two proper Dowries of that Age, <hi>Eloquence</hi> or <hi>Arms.</hi>

                  <p>I stand obliged in grateful memory, to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhat of a Prince long since at rest; namely, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando</hi> Grand Duke of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> vvhich vvas the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Hetruria,</hi> vvhose Palace of <hi>Piti</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> vvhen I came often to review, and still me thought vvith fresh admiration; being incomparably (as

far as I can yet speak by experience, or report) for solid <hi>Architecture,</hi> the most magnificent and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Pile vvithin the Christian World. It pleased him, by means of the Cavalier <hi>Vieta,</hi> his principal Secretary of Estate, to take some notice of my Person, though no intruder by Nature, and (God knows) of little ability.</p>
                  <p>The said Duke <hi>Ferdinando</hi> vvas reputed a vvise and vvary Prince; and it vvas a Solid vvisdom, rather then a Formal. He had been long a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, and at two or three Conclaves (as they call them) or Elections of Popes: so as he came to the Dukedom well seasoned before with practice, and vvell broken to Affairs: and vvith such an impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his first Tincture (as falleth out naturally in all things else) that he always maintained a great interest in the <hi>Roman</hi> Court; as indeed vvas neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for a near and jealous Confiner. He vvas in his Civil Regiment of a fine composition, between Frugality and Magnificence: A great cherisher of Manual Arts, especially such as tended to splendor and ornament; as <hi>Picture, Sculpture,</hi> cutting of Chrystals, Ambers, and all of the softer Gems, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying of Marbles, limning of Birds, Beasts, and Vegetables; Imbossing, and the like. In all which he drew to him from all parts the most exquisite Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers with a setled Pension, and placed them in several compartments of his Palace, vvhere he vvould come oftentimes to see them vvork for his own delight: and so he did furnish his Cabinets vvith Rarities at an easie rate, being, in truth, one of the greatest <hi>Oee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

After the death of the Duke <hi>Francesco</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it vvas a vvhile somewhat an Ambiguous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberative, vvhether he should divest the Cardinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or rule vvith a double Greatness, Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Civil: But the hope of Posterity over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balanced the scale; and so he took to Wife the Daughter of <hi>Loraign,</hi> as it vvere to interest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self novv in the Borders of <hi>France:</hi> whereas his Name before had spread it self in the Body. He vvas by nature more reserved then popular, and had virtues fitter to beget estimation then love; yet he vvould duly in his Coach take almost every day a revievv of the City, and receive Petitions vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly. Besides, I have been shewed a strange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of State, namely, an outward hole, like a Trunk, in a Wall of one of his Galleries, the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom vvhereof vvas under lock and key, into vvhich any one might let forth any secret intelligence, and convey it closely to the ears of the Prince: enough to disquiet all the days of his life. He vvas served by able Instruments of State, and diligently attended in Court; but rather by choice then num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and vvith more neatness then noise. He had a close and intrinsecal Favourite, by Birth a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, being born in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> but by his favour made Archbishop of <hi>Pisa,</hi> a notable Screen between him and his Subjects; upon vvhom the Duke vvould handsomely bestovv all manner of complaint; and he as vvillingly bear it. He vvas unquestionably the powerfullest of all the <hi>Italian</hi> Dukes: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing centred in the very Navel of <hi>italy,</hi> thereby the furthest from Invasion on all sides, and the most participant of the common Interest; vvhich, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, among other causes, hath much preserved that State in busie times: yet surely, a little over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:102693:169"/>
or over-looked by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> vvho holdeth in actual possession <hi>Pont Hercule, Telemene,</hi> and <hi>Piombino,</hi> vvhich vve may perchance not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call the Fetters of <hi>Hetruria.</hi> Of stature he vvas somewhat above the mean, a gross body, not apt to motion, and as quiet a Countenance. His Moneys vvere the purest and least corrupted vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Italian</hi> bounds: and his Markets the best or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered for prices of comestible Ware; vvhere, in all his Towns, a man might have sent out a Child for any flesh, or fish, at a rated price every Morning. To vvhich temper more septentrional unlimber Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have not yet bent themselves. On the other side, there vvas nothing brought into <hi>Florence</hi> from the Field, to the least sale, but by a long insensible servitude paid somewhat. This vvas the Civil and Natural habit of that Prince: and more might be said, if I vvere not pounded vvithin an <hi>Epistle.</hi> This Duke, vvhile I vvas a private Traveller in <hi>Florence,</hi> and vvent sometime by chance (sure I am, vvithout any design) to his Court, vvas pleased, out of some gracious conceit vvhich he took of my fidelity, (for nothing else could move it) to imploy me into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> vvith a Casket of <hi>Antidotes,</hi> or <hi>Preservatives,</hi> (vvherein he did excel all the Princes of the World) and vvith a Dispatch of high and secret Importance, vvhich he had intercepted touching some practice upon the Succession to this Crown; so as I am much obliged to his Memory (though it vvas a painful journey) for that Honour, and other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Beneficences; and especially because I came thereby first into the notice of the King your Father, of ever blessed memory, vvhen your Majesty was but a blooming Rose, vvhich afterwards drevv on my imployment to the Republick of <hi>Venice.</hi>

                     <p>I Owe your Lordship, even by promise, some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my foreign Travels: and the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations which I have taken touching this City and Republick, are these;</p>
                     <p>The general position of the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> I find much celebrated, even by the learnedest of the <note n="*" place="margin">Averhoes.</note> 
                        <hi>Arabians,</hi> as being seated in the very middle point between the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial and the Northern Pole, at 45. degrees pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:102693:171"/>
or next hand, of latitude: yet their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are for the most part sharper then ours, though about 6. degrees less of elevation; perchance by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity tothe chilly tops of the <hi>Alps,</hi> for Winds as well as Waters are tainted in their passage; and the consequence which men make in common discourse, from the Degree of the place to the Temper, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very deceiveable, without a due regard to other circumstances.</p>
                     <p>The Circuit thereof, through divers Creeks, is not well determinable; but as Astronomers use to measure the Stars, vve may account it a City of the first Magnitude; as <hi>London, Paris, Gaunt, Millain, Lisbon, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hovv they came to be founded in the midst of the Waters, I could never meet with any clear Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial. The best and most of their Authors ascribe their first beginnings rather to chance or necessity, then counsel; which yet in my opinion will amount to no more then a pretty conjecture intenebrated by Antiquity: for thus they deliver it; They say, that among the Tumults of the middle Age, vvhen Nations vvent about swarming like Bees; <hi>Atylas,</hi> that great Captain of the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> and scourge of the World (as he vvas styled) lying long vvith a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Army at the Siege of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> it struck a mighty affrightment and confusion into all the nearer parts; vvhereupon, the best sort of the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering People, out of divers Towns, agreed either suddenly, or by little and little (as fear vvill some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times collect, as vvell as distract) to convey them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their substance into the uttermost bosome of the <hi>Adriatick Gulf,</hi> and there possessed certain desolate Islets, by Tradition, about seventy in number, vvhich afterwards (necessity being the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:102693:172"/>
Mother of Art) were tacked together with Bridges, and so the City took a rude form, vvhich grevv ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized vvith time, and became a great example vvhat the smallest things vvell fomented may prove.</p>
                     <p>They glory in this their begining two ways: First, that surely their <hi>Progonitors</hi> vvere not of the meanest and basest quality; (for such having little to lose, had as little cause to remove.) Next, that they vvere timely instructed vvith Temperance and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury (the Nurses of Moderation.) And true it is, that as all things savour of their first Principles, so doth the said <hi>Republick</hi> (as I shall afterwards shew) even at this day: for the Rule vvill hold as vvell in Civil as in Natural Causes.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N <hi>Friday,</hi> being the 16 of <hi>March,</hi> in this year 1618. about an hour before Sun-setting, <hi>Giovanni Bem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi> the 91 Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> ended his dayes in the 75 year of his Age: His disease was a Feaver occasioned by some obstruction in his reins that stopped the course of his water:
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:102693:173"/>
Whether the Physicians did hasten his end, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from him more blood then his years could spare, is now too late a question. His name is one of the Ancientest among them. His Father was a Gentleman, almost of the lowest poverty, till he matched with a wealthy Citizens Daughter, who afterwards proved the Heir of her Father, leaving issue male this Duke <hi>Giovanni</hi> and <hi>Philippo</hi> his Brother: <hi>Philippo</hi> (who only was married, being not the Custome of <hi>Venice</hi> for more Brothers then one to take Wife) died some few moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Duke, in greater reputation then degree: For their Laws do suppress the Brothers of their Dukes. The Duke himself did arise by Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at Sea; His first Action of note was in the Battel of <hi>Lepanto;</hi> where besides some wounds that he received for his own share, the success of that great day, in such trepidation of the State, made every man meritorious. He was lastly (to omit his middle steps) while the. Republick stood under Excommunication by this Pope (the King of <hi>Spain</hi> likewise then arming) made General of their Maritime Forces. This is the solemnest Title they can confer under the Princedome, being indeed a kind of Dictatorship: to which they have no Charge equivalent on the Land, having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (as it seems) in honour of their Situation, to give the Prerogative of trust to that Element: To the Princedome he was chosen, being none of the Competitors then in voice. Who unable to make themselves, and unwilling to make their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents, (as he fashion is) agreed in a Third: He held the Place two years, three moneths, and twelve dayes with general good liking: though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, his praises were rather Moral then Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:102693:174"/>
as more consisting in goodness of disposition, then any other eminent Ability. For he was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eloquent, profound, nor learned, only no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in his splendour and oeconomical magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, beyond ordinary example, and perchance in another nature beyond Permission: For these Popularities among them, are somewhat hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. To Ambassadours he gave small satisfaction, save with his eyes, which were very gracious and kind. In his Countenance otherwise, there was an invincible weakness, alwayes blushing while he spake, and glad when he had done. Whereby his Answers were the more scant and meager. But this did imitate Wisdome: For a Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> that opens himself much, will be chidden. To conclude, he was in his civil course a good Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, and in his natural, a good man. They that are willing to censure him further, think his whole composition fitter for the quality of the State, then the times. Now being thus passed away, the first publick Care was to order his Funeral; till when, the Custome doth not suffer that a new can be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen. This was done the Thursday following with all due solemnity; and in the mean time was made five Correctors and three Inquisitors. The Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors are to consider what Laws be fit to be added or amended touching the future Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or in the form or the Dukes Oath, which they gently call his <note n="*" place="margin">La Promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That immediately after the choice of any new Duke, in the next Grand Councel, shall be openly rehearsed all former Decrees against Defrauders of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Chests. This they call in their Dialect</hi> Intac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camento di Casse, <hi>as unpardonable here as Treason.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other two merit no Memory, being only about little encrease of Provision for the Dukes Attendants, and some Enlargement of time for the Correctors Office, which heretofore did determine as soon as the Election began.</p>
                  <p>These new Orders thus made, and approved by the Grand Councel (from whence all Authority floweth) they proceeded on <hi>Friday</hi> morning to the Election.</p>
                  <p>About which time were discovered four Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors, <hi>Antonio Priuli, Gieconimo Giustiniano, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stino Nani,</hi> and <hi>Niccolo-Donato.</hi> The three first all <hi>Procuratori di St. Marco;</hi> Who are in number Nine, in degree the second Personages of the State, and commonly the Seminary of their Princes; though not of necessity, as well appeareth by the fourth Concurrent, who was yet no more then a Senator of the <hi>Wide Sleeve;</hi> a Vesture of eminent Gravity and Place in their Councels. Of these <hi>Priuli</hi> and <hi>Giustiniano</hi> having before been chosen Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Business of the <hi>Uscocchi,</hi> were by a new Warning and Penalty in the Senate on <hi>Friday</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (the Prince then languishing) commanded to be gone. But this did not prejudice their Hopes. For I have noted one singular property in the Composition of this State, That no mans for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:102693:175"/>
without other Demerits, are hindred by their Absence.</p>
                  <p>Now it shall be fit to set down, with what Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and with what Oppositions, they entred the List.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Priuli</hi> had passed through all the principal Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the State in the Civil way; And had lastly in the Military been <hi>Generalissimo</hi> (till sickness sent him home) in the <hi>Austrian</hi> Action. His own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily numerous; His Alliance strong; Himself a man of moderate nature, of pleasant and popular Conversation, rather free then sowr and reserved; of good extemporal judgement and discourse, for the satisfying of publick Ministers, which is the Dukes proper part. Lastly, Threescore and ten years old (for that must not be forgotten among his helps.) But he suffered two Objections, though both rather within his Fortune, then his Nature. The one, that he was the Father of a Cardinal, which might distract his Affection between the State and the Church. The other, that he was poor, and somewhat behind-hand. Of which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection on the other side, his Favourers made up part of his merit, as having indebted himself in the publick Service.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Giustiniano</hi> was a Gentleman, that had likewise passed through the best places at home, of excellent Gravity and Judgement, and of most unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Integrity; not violent, not avaricious, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly beloved of the people; to whose satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a time of this nature, it was perhaps meet to yield somewhat. He was besides, one year elder then <hi>Priuli;</hi> but his old age did not help him so much as he was hindred by the Antiquity of his Name For the Princedome having been for the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:102693:175"/>
two last Successions in the old Families, it was likely, the new would now strive to bring it back again among their own Blood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nani</hi> had carried himself meritoriously in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Imployments, particularly against the Pope, in the time of the Interdict; which held up his Credit among the good Patriots. And having been near the Supream Place at the last Election, he re-entred now with the more hope. Besides, being by nature stiff and sensitive, his cunning friends did mould that to his advantage; the time seeming to need such a man. But two wilde ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours did much oppress him, The one with the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort, that he had purchased by close gifts cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the poor Gentlemens Favours: The other with the people, that he had of late been Author of some hard Decrees; his age besides was but 63 years, and his complexion duràble.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Donato</hi> (sirnamed <hi>Testolina,</hi> for the littleness of his head) had been long time conversant in the gravest Consultations, was reputed one of the wealthiest Gentlemen of the whole City, of good natural capacity, and above the rest adorned with Erudition. Besides, he had the Commendation of fourscore years, and of a weak body. But it was thought somewhat presumptuous, that he should contend with persons of higher Rank: whereupon some conceived his end, only to gain a friend by his voices, and to make himself Procurator in the room of him that should be Prince.</p>
                  <p>With these hopes, and with these objections, they entred the Field, after they had laboured their friends one whole Week, namely, from the <hi>Friday</hi> night of the Dukes death, to the <hi>Friday</hi> morning following, and perhaps a good while before:
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:102693:176"/>
within which time, at the place of their <hi>Broglio</hi> (as they term it) where the Concurrents sue for voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Nani</hi> the youngest of the four, was noted by some vacant searching wits, to tread softly, to walk stoopingly, and to raise himself from Bench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es where he sate with laborious and painful gesture, as Arguments of no lasting man. Such a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting thing sometimes is Ambition. To come now to the Election.</p>
                  <p>The Election of the Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> is one of the most intricate and curious Forms in the World; consisting of ten several precedent Ballotations. Whereupon occurreth a pretty Question, What need there was of such a deal of solicitude in choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a Prince of such limited Authority? And it is the stranger, for having been long in use, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Forms being commonly the most simple. To which doubt, this Answer may serve the turn, that it was (as the tradition runneth) a Monks Invention of the <hi>Benedictin</hi> Order. And in truth, the whole mysterious frame therein, doth much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Cloyster. For first, a Boy must be snatched up below, and this Child must draw the Balls, and not themselves, as in all other Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: then is it strangely intermingled, half with Chance, and half with Choice. So as Fortune, as well as Judgement or Affection hath her part in it, and perhaps the greater. One point (as now and then happeneth, even in the mòst curious webs of this nature) seemeth somewhat unequal. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the 41 (who are the last immediate Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Duke) must be all of several Families, and of them twenty five at least concur to his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. For hereby the old names (which are but twenty four) cannot make a Duke without
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:102693:176"/>
help from some one of the new. And that is not easily gotten, through emulation between them, as strong perhaps as any publick respect. So as the two last Dukes, <hi>Memo</hi> and <hi>Bembo;</hi> both of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Blood, may upon the whole matter be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Irregularitives of Fortune, who hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise her <hi>Anomola.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to set down the Variations of Chance in every step of these Scrutinies, were tedious. Sure it is, that at the enclosing of the 41. (for those must be shut up like our Jurors of Inquest, but that they are better fed) <hi>Donato</hi> had fifteen sure Balls, <hi>Nani</hi> twelve, <hi>Giustiniano</hi> ten, and <hi>Priuli</hi> but four. So as no one of them had voices enough to exclude the other three from making a Duke: for to this Privative Power are required seventeen Balls at least. Nor any two of them, except <hi>Donato</hi> and <hi>Nani</hi> had reciprocally an inclusive Power to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance each other by joyning: for though <hi>Donato</hi> might have made <hi>Giustiniano,</hi> yet he could not be made by him, because their united strength was but precisely twenty five, which number indeed would have served the turn, but that one of them on <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s part (himself being of the number) must be abated. For contrary to the form of Election in the Empire, no man here can bestow his Ball upon his own person. So as upon the matter doth arise a kind of Riddle, That <hi>Donato</hi> was the weaker by his presence.</p>
                  <p>Thus they stood in their several Strengths when they were shut up with a Guard about the Palace: where during this Election, all Inferiour Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals cease, only the Colledge of the Preconsultors (as they term it) is daily open for the hearing of Ambassadors; the Senate likewise, and the High
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:102693:177"/>
Councel of Ten in their ordinary vigour. They remained close twelve full dayes: In which time divers false voices were vented. But none of the Competitors arriving to a sufficient number of Balls, they fell (as the fashion is) to ballote some others that did not concur. Among whom, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was so memorable as the Ballotation of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo Vini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ro;</hi> who having in the late Fight at Sea, with the <hi>Neopolitane</hi> Fleet preserved his honour, when the rest were nearer shame, had now eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Balls for the supream place of his Countrey, though otherwise as yet, of but small rank himself. At last these 41 Electors tired with trials, <hi>Nani</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to make himself, not inclining to <hi>Giustiniano,</hi> as being of an old House, with <hi>Priuli</hi> privately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stated, and generally, wishing him best, that was unlikeliest to live long; On <hi>Thursday</hi> morning, being the fifth of <hi>April,</hi> declared unto his friends, that he would joyn with <hi>Donato:</hi> which the rest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, they owed (though not to him, yet) to themselves more good will, then not to favour that which they could not hinder. And so <hi>Niccolo Donato</hi> was made Duke, with thirty nine Balls, his own exempted (as I have said) by Law, and some one of the rest shrinking, I know not how, <hi>per Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priccio</hi> perhaps, rather then despight. This is the sixth man under the Degree of a Procurator, that hath been made Duke since the foundation of the City; which makes <hi>Nani</hi> the more odious among his own Colleagues, for advancing an inferiour Order; which perchance hereafter upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample may grow more familiar. He was published with slight Applause, and with more approbation (as it seems) of the Stars, then of men. For it is vulgarly reported from his own mouth, and here
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:102693:177"/>
strongly believed, That an Astrologer some years since in <hi>Padoua,</hi> having cast his Nativity, told him he should die in <hi>Carcere nobili,</hi> which they now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to so restrained a Princedome, helping it with Conceipt; as commonly those kind of Predictions do need.</p>

                     <p>ON <hi>Tuesday</hi> the eighth of <hi>May Niccolo Donato</hi> died, about two hours of the night, as near as the moment could be known, which his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews and Servants did conceal, and is never ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily published by the State. His disease was an <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> wherewith being surprized after a gentle fit or two of an Ague, he had no leisure, or no mind to alter a former Will, made while he was but a Senator, so miserably, as if he had meant to be frugal even after his death: For therein he left but twenty five Ducats to all his Servants, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly twenty to the Nuns of Sta. <hi>Chiara</hi> at <hi>Murano,</hi> where he disposed his Body to be laid. The short time of his Princedome (having been but a moneth and two dayes) did yield little matter of observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. One thing was notable, that entring with small applause of the common men, he suddenly got their favours upon a false conceit. For a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree

having passed in his Predecessors time about the reformation of Bakers (who made scant loaves) and being conceived to be his deed, the <hi>Plebeyity</hi> (whose supream Object is Bread) cryed in all corners, <hi>Viva Donato.</hi> In his nature there was a strange Conjunction of two things rarely seen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Love of learning,</hi> and <hi>Love of money.</hi> And this is all that can be said of him.</p>
                     <p>Now being gone, the following Election was likely to be short, the same Concurrence appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as before, and the affections having been so newly sounded and prepared. Therefore (not to extend discourse) the Dukes Funeral Rites being performed the <hi>Monday</hi> after his death, the <hi>Thursday</hi> morning following, <hi>Antonio Priuli</hi> was made Duke, with all Balls. For <hi>Giustiniano</hi> having but eight voices among the last One and fourty Electors, and <hi>Nani</hi> (by strange, and almost prodigious for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune) none, the foresaid eight friends of <hi>Giustini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano,</hi> unprofitable for him whom they loved best, did immediately concur with <hi>Priuli</hi>'s thirty three voices. And so a solemn Ambassage is preparing out of the body of the Senate to determine his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission in <hi>Friuli,</hi> and to recall him to the supream honour of his Countrey.

                  <p>O ye Ornaments of the Sky, who when all the World is silent, obey your Maker in the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Order of your Motions! Can Man behold his own duty in a fairer Volume? why then stand I gazing here, and do not rather go my self to hasten my Servants, that I may execute his Will? But
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:102693:179"/>
stay: His Will? Why? Is his Will contrary to the example of his own Justice? Did he not heavily punish <hi>Cain,</hi> even at the beginning of the first World, for killing but a Brother? and can I stay my Child, and imbrue my hands in mine own Bowels, without offence of his Immortal Majesty? Yes; why not? The Act of <hi>Cain,</hi> was the Act of his own sinful malice; but I have received an immediate Command from God himself. A Command? Why? Is his Command against his Law? shall the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Truth be served with Contradictions? Did not the same God, streight after the universal Deluge, (as our Fathers have told us) denounce this Judgement; That <hi>whoso sheddeth mans blood, his blood shall be shed?</hi> How then can I herein obey my God, but I must withal disobey Him?</p>
                  <p>O my weak Soul, what poor Arguments doest thou search to cover thine own rebellious Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons! Is there any Warrant higher then his Will? or any better Interpreter of his Will then himself? If the Princes of the Earth (who are but mortal Types of his invisible Glory) can alter their Edicts at pleasure; shall not the Lord of the whole (whom Angels and Men adore) have leave to dispence with his own Prohibitions? Yes surely: But then how shall the Blessing that my good God hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined upon my Seed, and even upon this very Child, be accomplished, if I destroy the Root? O Lord, was not thy Divine goodness pleased, in the depth of thy Mercy, to accept my Belief for Righteousness? and shall I now frustrate thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises with my Obedience? But what! am I fallen again into a new Reluctation? Have I before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested with thy Justice? and shall I now dispute thy Power? Didst thou not create the Light before the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:102693:180"/>
Sun? and the effect before the cause? and shall I bind thee to the Passions of a natural Agent? Didst thou not make this All of Nothing, even by thy Word (which was thy Wisdom?) and foment all that thou hast made by thy Spirit (which is thy Love?) and shall I doubt but thou canst raise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Nations out of the very Ashes of my poor <hi>Isaac?</hi> Nay, did I not even at first receive him in a manner from a dead Womb? and art not thou still the same Almighty and ever living God, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Father, full of all tenderness and compassion, that seest from Heaven whereof we are made? Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my Discourses, and forget my Delays; I am now going to perform thy good Pleasure. And yet there is remaining one humble Suit; which refuse not (O my God) though it proceed from the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of thine unworthy Creature: Take my Child, and all that is mine; I have resigned him with my whole Heart unto thy Will. He is already thine, and mine no longer; and I glory that he shall die upon thy holy Altar. But yet I fear withal, that these my shaking hands, and fainting Limbs, vvill be seized vvith horror; be not therefore (Dear Lord) displeased, if I use my Servants in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. How now, my Soul! doest thou shrink in the last Act of thy Loyalty? Can I yet vvalk up and down about vile and ordinary Functions, and vvhen my God is to be served, do my Joynts and Members fail me? Have I humbled my desires to his Will, and shall I deny him the choice of his own Instrument? Or if his indulgent Mercy would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, shall I suffer another to anticipate the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of my Obedience?

and yet even in that likewise, I should have conduced to the variety of thy glorious Wisdom; but hast vouchsafed to endue us vvith the form of Man, and to breath into our first Parent that spark of thy Divine Light vvhich vve call Reason, to comprehend and acknowledge therewith thy high and indisputable Soveraignty over all Nature; Thou then (Eternal maker and Mover, whose Will is the first of Causes, and whose Glory is the last of Ends) direct my Feet to the Place which thou hast appointed; strengthen there these poor Hands to accomplish thy Pleasure, and let Heaven and Earth obey thee.</p>

what shall I first, what shall I most admire? All is depth, all is wonder and amazement.

Or shall I pass from this Miracle of Knowledg to <hi>Thy</hi> Miracles os <hi>Charity,</hi> in healing the Blind, the Lame, the Deaf, the Dumb? Or shall I more insist upon the Acts of <hi>Thy Power,</hi> in checking the <hi>Winds,</hi> in walking on the <hi>Waves,</hi> in raising the <hi>Dead,</hi> in ejecting the impure <hi>Spirits?</hi> Or shall I remain stupified (as all the Learnedest part of the World was, which lay grovelling in the Contemplation of Inferiour Causes) that at <hi>Thy</hi> Coming, all their false <hi>Oracles</hi> and <hi>Delusions</hi> were strucken mute, and nothing to be heard at <hi>Delphos,</hi> or <hi>Hammon?</hi> Or shall I contemplate, that at <hi>Thy Passion</hi> all <hi>Nature</hi> did suffer, the <hi>Earth</hi> did shake, and the <hi>Heavens</hi> were darkened? Or lastly, after <hi>Thou</hi> hadst triumphed over <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> (whose Keys are in thine hand) shall I glorifie <hi>Thy Assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi> into the Highest <hi>Heavens?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes, <hi>Lord,</hi> all this, and much more there is then the whole World can contain, if it were written: Yet one thing remains, even after <hi>Thy glorious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,</hi> for the comfort of our <hi>Souls,</hi> above all the <hi>Miracles</hi> of <hi>Thy Goodness,</hi> and of <hi>Thy Power,</hi> That <hi>Thou</hi> hast dispensed <hi>Thy saving Doctrine</hi> unto curious Men, not only by Eloquent <hi>Sophists,</hi> and Subtil <hi>School-men,</hi> (such as have since distracted and torn thy <hi>Church</hi> in pieces;) but by the simpliest and silliest <hi>Instruments:</hi> so as it must needs be <hi>Thy Divine Truth,</hi> since it was impressed by no <hi>Humane Means.</hi> For, give me leave again, my <hi>dear Lord,</hi> to demand, in

                     <p>My Lord my Brother is returned a day sooner then he thought, out of <hi>Kent,</hi> for that the King

(who is now at <hi>Hampton-Court)</hi> hath appointed all his Counsellors, and all the Judges, to meet Him here to morrow about matters of the Mint, as it is voiced, perhaps to cover some greater Subject, and yet Money is a great one.</p>
                     <p>On Saturday the King goeth to <hi>Windsor,</hi> there to honour with his presence both his Sons and his Favourites at their Instalments.</p>
                     <p>On Sunday last the new <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambassador had his first Audience at <hi>Greenwich:</hi> at which time the old took his leave, and received from the King three Honours, An addition of the <hi>English</hi> Lion to his Coat-Armour, Knight-hood, and the Sword with the Furniture from the Kings side, wherewith he had Knighted him: which last, being more then was done to any of his Predecessors, and done to him who had deserved less then any, is enough to prove, that wise Kings know how to do graces, and hide affections: so mystical things are Courts.</p>
                     <p>Now, to lead you a little abroad; for I have no more to say within our own visible Horizon: We have advice out of <hi>Germany,</hi> that they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from the Emperour his consent to make <hi>Matthias</hi> King of the <hi>Romans:</hi> so as having first spoiled him of obedience and reverence; next, of his estates and titles; they have now reduced him to so low a case, that he is no longer Patron of his own voice. Howsoever, this violent cure is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to settle the Motions of <hi>Germany;</hi> out of which Countrey, when they are quiet at home, they may perhaps send us some suiters hither. This is all (Sir) that I can write at the present; which is your advantage; for if there had been more, you had been further troubled: And so with many

                     <p>ONe Reason of my writing now unto you, is because it seemeth a great while unto me since I did so. Another, to give you many thanks (which upon the casting up of my reckonings, I find I have not yet done) for that Gelding wherewith you so much honoured me: which, in truth, either for goodness or beauty runneth for one of the very best about this place; And I have had a great deal of love made unto me for him by no small ones. After this, I must plainly tell you, that I mean to perswade you, I am sorry I cannot say, to invite you, (for my Mind would bear that word better then my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune) to bestow your self, and your whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon us this <hi>Shrovetide,</hi> if it be but for three dayes at the conjunction of the <hi>Thames</hi> and the <hi>Rhene,</hi> as our ravished Spirits begin to call it.

                     <p>Now let me therefore, with this hobling Pen, again and again pray you to resolve upon your coming, if not with all the fair Train, yet your self and my Lady, and my Nephew and his Wife, or at the least of leasts, the Masculine.</p>
                     <p>We begin to lay off our mourning habits, and the Court will shortly, I think, be as merry as if it were not sick. The King will be here to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: The <hi>Friday</hi> following he goeth to <hi>Windsor,</hi> with the <hi>Count Palatine,</hi> about the Ceremony of his Instalment.

                     <p>I Beseech your Majesty to pardon me a little short repetition, how I have spent my time since my departure from your Royal sight, because I glory in your goodness.</p>
                     <p>I have been imployed by your favour in four se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Treaties differing in the Matter, in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, and in the Affections.</p>
                     <p>The first was for the sequestration of <hi>Juliers,</hi> wherein I was joyned with the <hi>French.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second for the provisional possession of the two Pretendents: wherein (contrary to the complaint of the Gospel) the Labourers were more then the Harvest.</p>
                     <p>The third was for a defensive League between the united Provinces and the united Princes: Who though they be separate Bodies of State, do now by your onely Mediation, make one Body of Strength.</p>
                     <p>The fourth was for the composing of some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between your own and this People; in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Commerce; which hath exceeded the other Three, both in length and in difficulty, for two Reasons as I conceive it:</p>
                     <p>First, Through the sensibleness of the Subject, which is private Utility: next, because it had a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret commixture of publick respects, and those of no light consequence: For surely, it importeth more to let the King of <hi>Spain</hi> dispense alone the Commodities of the East, then for either of us to want them.</p>

                        <pb n="281" facs="tcp:102693:186"/>
Now of the three former Treaties, I have given your Majesty an accompt in divers Dispatches, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my poor apprehensions. As for this last, they that have eased my weakness in the conduct thereof (I mean my good Associates, by whose light and leadings I have walked) will ease me like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, by your gracious leave, in the Relation. By them it may please your Majesty to understand in what fair terms we have left it; somewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling to my fancy those Women of <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> who (they say) are never brought to bed in the place where they conceive, but bring forth their children in a better Air: And so I hope that our travels and unformed conceptions will take life in your own Kingdome, which will be more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to their Birth. For our parts, I dare affirm of these your Commissioners, that now return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the comfort of your gracious Aspect, That they have discharged their Duties and their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with all faithfull care of your Majesties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. I am confident likewise that they will give me their honest Testimony: And we are bound joyntly to profess unto your Majesty (from whom we receive our estimation) the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects and kindnesses that have been here done us, as your Vassals.</p>

                     <p>I Will be bold, by this opportunity, to give His Majesty, through your Lordships hands, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a Command which I had from him at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> about sounding how the <hi>Venetian</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador stood satisfied with the late determination touching his predecessor <hi>Donato.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I did visit the said Ambassador immediately at my return from the King, and saluted him, as by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Commandment; interjecting some words of mine own gladness, that he had received content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this tender point, which would signalize his beginnings. This I said, because in truth I had found him always before the more passionate in it, by some reflection upon himself. His answer (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter due thanks for His Majesties gracious remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him from abroad) was, that for his own part, he was <hi>Contentissimo,</hi> and had represented things home in the best manner. He hoped like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it would be well tasted there also, though with some doubt, because the State, out of their own devotion towards His Majesty, might form a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of expecting more.</p>
                     <p>I replied, that the King upon the matter (if we consider disgrace) had done more then themselves: for he was but once banished at <hi>Venice,</hi> and twice here; <hi>viz.</hi> once from the verge of the Court, and secondly from <hi>London;</hi> which was as much as could be done with preservation of rational immunities,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:102693:187"/>
and more then would have been done at the suit of of any other Ambassador here resident; or perhaps of any of their own hereafter, if the like Case shall occur. For (as I told him) it was the Kings express will, that his particular respect to the Republick, and to him in this business, should not be drawn into Examples. With this point he was not a little pleased, for his own glory; and said, that indeed Master Secretary <hi>Nanton</hi> had told him so. This was the sum of what passed between us, omitting imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies. Let me end, (my dear Lord) as I am bound, in all the use either of my pen, or of my voice, with an humble and hearty acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my great obligations towards your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which will make me resolve, and in good faith unhappy, till I can some way shew my self,</p>

                     <p>FRom this place I determined to make my first Dispatch unto Your Majesty, hoping in such Cities and Courts vvhereunto I had address on the vvay, to take up somewhat that should be
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:102693:188"/>
considerable, and till then unwilling to entertain Your solicitous Mind vvith immaterial things.</p>
                     <p>I have hitherto been vvith five several Princes and Communities, the Duke of <hi>Loraign,</hi> the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> the Town of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Ulme,</hi> in the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as I have set them down; among whom I spent in all twelve days, and the rest of the time in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessant journeys, vvhereof I shall now render Your Majesty a full account in the substance, retrenching impertinencies.</p>
                     <p>Unto the Duke of <hi>Loraign,</hi> I had no credential address from Your Royal hand; and yet to pass silently (like a stream through his Land) by a Prince of so near conjunction in blood with You, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed in the scope of my errand, as a member of the Empire, had been some incongruity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore excusing (as I might justly) the want of Letters, vvith my purpose to have taken another way, till I heard that the <hi>French</hi> King had cleared the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Loraign,</hi> by drawing such Forces as lay hovering there, with some hazard of Passengers, over the River of <hi>Marne</hi> towards <hi>Normandy:</hi> I say, after this excuse, I told him, I knevv Your Majesty vvould be singularly pleased to understand by me of his health; and that I had, <hi>in transitu,</hi> conferred vvith him Your Christian ends, vvherein You could not but expect at his hands a concurrence both of Counsel and Affection. This I said, to dravv ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy from him as much as I could, being a Prince cumbred (as I found him) vvith the <hi>German</hi> troubles on the one side, and the <hi>French</hi> on the other; and therefore bound to study the passages of both: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially having a State, vvhich perhaps is harder for him to keep neutral then himself. In the rest of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:102693:188"/>
my discourse, I possessed him vvith two main heads of mine Instructions: First, vvith Your Majesties innocency in the <hi>Bohemian</hi> business at the beginning; next, vvith Your impartiality therein, even to this hour: both vvhich did render You in this cause, the fittest Mediator of the World. And so I shut up all vvith this, That God had given Your Majesty two eminent blessings; the one, Peace at home, the other (vvhich vvas surely the greater, and the rarer) a Soul desirous of the like abroad; vvhich You found Your self tied in the Conscience of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian King to prosecute by all possible means: and therefore, though You had before in the beginning of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Motions, sent Your good meaning by a solemn Ambassage to the Emperor, in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a dear and zealous Servant of great Quality, even before any other King had entred into it, vvhich, through the crudity of the matter, as then, took not the vvished effect: yet novv hoping that time it self, and the experience of vexation, had mollified the affections, and better digested the difficulties, You had not refused by several Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassages to both sides, and to all the intervenient Princes and States, to attempt again this high and Christian Work. Thus much, though in effect ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from Your Majesties own directions, I have here once rehearsed, to save the repetition thereof in my following Audiences at other places.</p>
                     <p>The Dukes answer was more tender, then free, lamenting much the present condition of things, commending as much Your Majesties good mind, proclaiming his own, remitting the vvhole to those great and vvise Kings that had it in hand, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding (vvith a voice, me thought, lower then before, as if he had doubted to be overheard, though
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:102693:189"/>
in his private Chamber) that the Princes of the Union vvould tell me vvhat his affections vvere in the Cause: For vvhich I gave him thanks, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending in all events to his continual memory, that Your Majesties Daughter, my gracious Lady, and her Descendents vvere of the Bloud of <hi>Loraign:</hi> Yea, said he, and the <hi>Elector</hi> likewise. This vvas all that passed from him of any moment. After vvhich, he brought me to <hi>Monsieur de Vaudemont,</hi> vvhose principal business (as I hear) at the present, is to vvork the Dukes assent, and the Popes dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, for a Marriage between his own Son and his Brothers Daughter; a thing much affected by that People, and no doubt fomented by <hi>France,</hi> to keep so important a Province from Strangers. In the mean vvhile <hi>de Vaudemont</hi>'s Son, for improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his merit and fame, is bestowed in the Command of those Troops vvhich vvere suffered to pass the Rheine at <hi>Brysack</hi> on <hi>Whitson-Monday</hi> last. Before I leave <hi>Loraign,</hi> I cannot but adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise Your Majesty that at <hi>Faltsbourg,</hi> a Town in the confines of that Province towards <hi>Elsatia</hi> (inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited and built by many good men of the Religion) the Ministers came unto me, bewailing the case of the Inhabitants, vvho for some thirty years had possessed that place quietly, till of late by insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Jesuits at <hi>Nancy,</hi> the Duke had given them vvarning to be gone vvithin the term of two years, vvhereof some good part vvas expired. Their request unto me vvas, that by Your Majesties gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Mediation, they might be received into a place vvithin the <hi>Palatine</hi> Jurisdiction, near their present seat, which they offered to enlarge, and fortifie at their own charge, upon the grant of reasonable immunities: vvhich I have assumed to
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:102693:189"/>
treat by Letter vvith Your Majesties Son-in-lavv; needing no other commission from Your Majesty in things of this nature, then Your own goodness.</p>
                     <p>The Arch-Duke <hi>Leopald,</hi> I vvas forced to seek three days journey from his ordinary seat; where, being at his private sports of the field, and no fit things about him, he desired me to turn back half <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> days journey to <hi>Mulzham,</hi> the notorious nest of <hi>Jesuits:</hi> commanding the Governors of his Towns, in the mean time, to use me vvith all due respects; among vvhom he made choice of an <hi>Italian,</hi> by name <hi>Ascanio Albertine,</hi> (a man of singular confidence vvith him, and surely of very fair conditions) to sound me, though in a merry fashion, and half laughing, (as there was good cause) how I would taste it, if he should receive me in the <hi>Jesuits</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: for at <hi>Mulzham</hi> those were his Hosts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing destitute of other habitation. I answered him, as merrily as it was propounded, that I knew the <hi>Jesuits</hi> had every where the best rooms, more splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent then true, fitter to lodge Princes then Monks; and that their habitations were always better then themselves. Moreover, that for mine own part, though I was not much afraid of their infection; and that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did not refuse to be carried in a Ship, which was consecrated to false Gods; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause on our side they were generally, and (no doubt) justly reputed the true causes of all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Christian World, I doubted it would be a scandalous Reception; and that besides, those Artificers vvould go near to make appear on my part, a kind of silent approbation of their Order and course. This was my answer, which being faithfully transported by the <hi>Italian,</hi> the Arch-Duke made choice of another mean house in the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:102693:190"/>
Town, vvhere he received me truly in a noble sweet fashion: to whom having presented Your Majesties Letters, and Love, he disposed himself with sharp attention to hear me. To him, besides that which I had said to the Duke of <hi>Loraign,</hi> I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded two things:</p>
                     <p>The first, that not only Your Majesty was clear of all fore-knowledge, or counsel, in the business of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> but likewise Your Son-in-law himself of any precedent practice therein, till it was laid upon him, as You knew by his own high affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and most infallible testimonies.</p>
                     <p>The second, that though Your Majesty to this hour did continue as equal betwixt both parties, as the <hi>Equinoctial</hi> between the <hi>Poles,</hi> yet about the time of my departure You were much moved, and the whole Land likewise, with a voice, I know not how spread abroad, that there were great preparations to invade the Nether <hi>Palatinate;</hi> which if it did fall out, Your Majesty should have just reason to think Your Moderation unthankfully requited; the said <hi>Palatinate</hi> being the Patrimonial Lands of Your own Descendents, and no way connexed with the <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> Business. Whereupon I perswaded him fairly, in Your Majesties Name, being a Personage of such authority in the present actions, to keep them from any such precipitious and impertinent rupture as might preclude all Mediation of Accord: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Your Majesty had now, which was a second Argument of Your equity, sent several Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to the Fountains, for Your better informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the merit of the Cause, by Your own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, I besought him to illuminate me, who was the weakest of Your Creatures, as far as he should think fit, and to assist me with his best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:102693:190"/>
towards this good end, whereunto, besides the dear Commandment of the King my Master, I would confer mine own plain and honest zeal.</p>
                     <p>His answer, to all the points, which he had very orderly laid up, was this: Of Your Majesties own clearness he professed much assurance; of Your Son-in-law as much doubt, charging him both with close practice with the <hi>Bohemians</hi> at the time of the Emperors Election at <hi>Francfort,</hi> and more foully with a new practice, either by himself or by others, to introduce the <hi>Turk</hi> into <hi>Hungary.</hi> Of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign upon the Lower <hi>Palatinate,</hi> he utterly disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed all knowledge on his part; yet would not deny, but the Marquess <hi>Spinola</hi> might perchance have some such aim; and if things went on, as they do, men would no doubt assail their enemies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they should find them. In such ambiguous clouds as these, he wrapped this point. Of the Emperors inclination to an agreement, he bade me be very assured; but never vvithout restitution of the usurped Kingdom, vvhich vvas not a loss of easie concoction, especially being taken from him by the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> his Subject, as he often called him; and once added, that he thought he vvould not deny it himself. Of the merit of the cause, he said he had sent divers records and papers to the Emperor, vvhere I should find them.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, he acknowledged himself much bound unto Your Majesty for the honour You had done him, to take such knowledge of his Person, and was contented to bestow some thanks upon me for mine honest inclination, which he would present, before my arrival, at <hi>Vienna.</hi> I had almost omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a point touched by him, that he had knowledge of some <hi>English</hi> Levies coming toward the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate:</hi>
                        <pb n="290" facs="tcp:102693:191"/>
About which I cleared him, with confessing that Your Majesties People, and some of Your principal Nobility, had taken Alarm upon a voice of an Invasion there, and meant voluntarily to sacrifice themselves in that action; but vvithout any concurrence of Your Majesty thereunto, either by money or command. To which he replied, that in truth so he had heard, and made no question of Your Royal Integrity. In the afternoon of this day, he took me abroad with him in his Coach, to shew me some of his nearer Towns and Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; and there descended into many familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and amongst other, to shew us how to make Frogs leap at their own skins: a strange purchase, me thought, at a time when Kingdoms are in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: But it may be it was an Art to cover his weightier Meditations.</p>
                     <p>Amongst other discourse, there was some men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Your Majesties Treaty with <hi>Spain,</hi> in point of Alliance; which I told him, was a concluded business: for that warrant I had from Your own Royal mouth in Your Gallery at <hi>Theobalds,</hi> having let fall none of Your syllables. Whereupon he said, That he did not despair upon so good an occasion, to salute Your Majesty in Your own Court. The morning following, he sent unto me <hi>Seignior Asca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> with express desire, that since Your Majesties intentions were so clear, I would as frankly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him, whether in mine Instructions I had any particular form of accord to project unto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror: which himself likewise at my second Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence did somewhat importunely press, excusing his curiosity with a good meaning, to prepare the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, in as good manner as he could, to accept it. My answer was, that Your Majesty thought it first
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:102693:191"/>
necessary on both sides to dispose the affections, and then by reciprocal Intelligence between Your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, from <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Prague,</hi> to collect some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Agreement; for otherwise, if we should find both Parties fixed in extream resolutions, it were a folly to spend any further the Honour of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. Here again he told me, that I should find the Emperor peswasible enough, if his Reputation may be saved: and for his own part, he thought that the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> being the Inferior, might yield without prejudice of his. To terms of this height he revolved, and of the same complexion are his Letters to Your Majesty, that I send herewith, of which I must needs say, that in some part, <hi>Olent Patrem Henricum,</hi> so they call a <hi>Jesuit</hi> of inward credit with him. Always true it is, that they were couched in the Colledge, for his Secretaries were absent, as the <hi>Italian</hi> told me, at his ordinary place of residence. At my leave-taking, he spake with much reverence of Your Majesty, with much praise of Your Christian mind, and with much thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Honour You had done him. He is a Prince of good stature, of fair complexion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to fulness: His face, the very best, as they tell me of the House of <hi>Austria;</hi> and better indeed then his fashion. No curiosity in his clothing, no affectation in his discourse; extream affable, both to strangers, and among his own: Patient of labour, and delighting in motion. In sum, little of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, save the Bishoprick and a long Coat; with which short character of his Person, I have taken the boldness to end, being (as I conceive it) the duty of Servants to represent unto their Masters the Images of those (with whom they treat) and as well their natural as artificial Impressions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="292" facs="tcp:102693:192"/>
Of <hi>Strasburg</hi> and <hi>Ulm,</hi> I may speak conjunctively, being of one nature; both free, and both jealous of their freedom, which makes them fortifie apace. Towards me likewise they joyned in one point of good respect, namely, in not suffering me to come to their Senate-house, but in treating with me where I was lodged by the deputed Persons, out of the reverence (as they professed) due to Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, who had done them so much honour with Your Letters, and with communication of Your ends by Your humble Servant. They both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended Your Majesties Christian intensions, and professed themselves hitherto in the same Neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but because it were uncivil for them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute their Counsels, where such Kings did em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their Wisdom and Authority, they would only contribute their Prayers, with the like temperate conceits as these, appearing likewise in their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which I send by this Bearer.</p>
                     <p>Into the Duke of <hi>Wirtenberg</hi>'s Court I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived very nobly, and kindly feasted at his Table, with the Princess, and other great Ladies, and most part of the day lead by himself, to view his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, Buildings, and other Delights.</p>
                     <p>The material points collected here, I must divide partly into my discourse with himself, and partly into such knowledge as he commanded <hi>Monsieur Buvinckhousen</hi> to give me, which cometh in a Paper apart, being very material.</p>
                     <p>In his own Speech, he made great profession to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Your Majesty, wherein no Prince of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire should exceed him; and as much toward the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> as he ever called Your Son-in-law: of whose clearness from all precedent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, when I fell to speak, he told me, that in that
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:102693:192"/>
point he would ease me; for himself visiting the Elector, a little after he was chosen, he found him extreamly perplexed, even to effusion of tears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two considerations, That if he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the offer, the World would falsely conceive it to have sprung from his Ambition; if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused it, that People was likely to fall into despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Counsels, vvith danger of calling more then Christian help. In the rest of his discourse, I was glad to hear him often vow, that he vvould defend the <hi>Palatinate</hi> with all his power, being tied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto not only by the Bond of Confederacy, but likewise by Reason of State, not to suffer a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to neighbor him.</p>
                     <p>I have now ended for the present Your Majesties trouble. There remain of my Commission, the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the Emperor. The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> I shall find actually in arms about <hi>Lintz,</hi> in the upper <hi>Austria,</hi> and the Emperor at <hi>Vienna:</hi> from both places I will make several Dispatches unto Your Majesty, and afterwards weekly, or more frequently, as the occasion shall rise. Let this in the mean time end in my humble thanks to Almighty God for the repose of Your own Estates, and in my hearty Prayers for the preservation of Your dear and sacred Person.</p>

                     <p>OF my purpose to depart from <hi>Vienna,</hi> and to leave the Emperour to the Counsels of his own Fortune, I gave his Majesty know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by my servant <hi>James Vary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="294" facs="tcp:102693:193"/>
I will now make you a summary accompt of what hath happened here, which is to be done both out of Duty to your Place, and out of Obligation to your Friendship.</p>
                     <p>The Count <hi>Tampier</hi> had some twelve dayes since taken from the <hi>Hungarians</hi> by surprisal in the Field, thirteen Cornets of Horse, and one Ensign of Foot, which here with much ostentation were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up and down, and laid on Sunday was seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night under the Emperours feet, as he came from the Chappel.</p>
                     <p>Some note, that the vanity of this triumph was greater then the merit; for the <hi>Hungarians</hi> by their ordinary discipline, abound in Cornets, bearing one almost for every twenty Horse, so as Flags are good cheap amongst them, and but slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guarded: Howsoever the matter be made more or less, according to the wits on both sides, this was <hi>brave gaudium,</hi> and it self indeed some cause of the following disaster; For the Count <hi>Tampier,</hi> being by nature an enterprising man, was now also inflamed by accident; which made him immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceive the surprisal of <hi>Presburg,</hi> while the Prince of <hi>Transilvania</hi> was retired to the siege of <hi>Guns,</hi> some six or seven Leagues distant. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in truth, if it had prospered, of notorious utility.</p>
                     <p>First by the very reputation of the Place, being the Capital Town of <hi>Hungaria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next, the access to <hi>Comar</hi> and <hi>Rab,</hi> (which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces only the Emperour retaineth in that Kingdome of any considerable value) had been freed by water, which now in a manner are blocked up.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the incursions into these Provinces, and ignominious depredations had been cut off.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="295" facs="tcp:102693:193"/>
And lastly, the Crown of <hi>Hungaria</hi> had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, which the Emperour <hi>Matthias</hi> did tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport to the Castle of <hi>Presburg,</hi> after the deposition of <hi>Rodolph</hi> his Brother, who alwayes kept it in the Castle of <hi>Prague;</hi> which men account one of the subtil things of that retired Emperour, as I hear by discourse. So as upon these considerations, the enterprise was more commendable in the design, then it will appear in the execution; being thus carried.</p>
                     <p>From hence to <hi>Presburg</hi> is in this moneth of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> an easie nights journey by water. Thither on Thursday night of the last week, <hi>Tampier</hi> himself, accompanied with some four or five Colonels, and other remarkable men of this Court, resolves to bring down in 25 Boats, about 3000 Foot, or such a matter; having given order, and space enough before, for certain Horse, partly <hi>Dutch,</hi> and partly <hi>Polonians,</hi> to be there, and to attend his coming about two hours before Friday morning. And to shadow this purpose, himself on Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in the afternoon, with affected noise goes up the River the contrary vvay, though no reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble imaginations could conceive vvhither; for the lower <hi>Austria</hi> vvas then all reduced. By vvhich Artificial delay, and by some natural stops in the shallows of the vvater, vvhen they fell silently down again, it vvas three or four hours of clear day before he arrived at <hi>Presburg</hi> the next morning: Where his meaning vvas, first to destroy the Bridge built upon Boats, and thereby to keep <hi>Bethlehem Gabor,</hi> (as then on the <hi>Austrian</hi> side) not only from succouring the Town, but from all possibility of repassing the <hi>Danuby</hi> nearer then <hi>Buda.</hi> Next, to apply the <hi>Petard</hi> to one of the Gates of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:102693:194"/>
the <hi>Cittadel.</hi> Some say, he had likewise inward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, that at his approach, the Wicket of the Castle should be opened unto him by one <hi>Palfy</hi> an <hi>Hungarian</hi> Gentleman; vvhich conceit, though perchance raised at first to animate the Souldier, yet hath gotten much credit, by seeing the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise against all discourse continued by day-light. Be that point how it vvill, his fatal hour vvas come: for approaching a Skonce that lyes by the Castle-gate, and turning about to cry for his men to come on, he vvas shot in the lowest part of his Skull nearest his Neck, after vvhich he spake no syllable, as <hi>Don Carolo d' Austria</hi> (second base Son to <hi>Rodolph</hi> the Emperour, and himself at that time saved by the goodness of his Armour) doth testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. After vvhich, some two or three Souldiers attempting to bring away his Body, and those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shot, the rest gave it over, and the vvhole Troops transported themselves to the other side, leaving the Boats behind them, as if they had meant to contribute new provision for the mending of the Bridge, vvhereof they had only broken one little piece.</p>
                     <p>This vvas the end of the Count <hi>Tampier;</hi> By his Fathers side a <hi>Norman,</hi> by his Mothers a <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne,</hi> a servant twenty two years to the House of <hi>Austria.</hi> Himself Captain of a thousand Horse: but Commander divers times in chief, especially before the coming of the Count <hi>Bucquoy,</hi> from vvhom he vvas severed to these nearer Services, being of incompatible natures: a valiant, and plotting Souldier; In Encounters more fortunate then Sieges; Gracious to his own, and terrible to the <hi>Hungarians.</hi> To the present Emperour most dear, though perchance, as much for Civil, as
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:102693:194"/>
Military Merit: for this vvas the very man that first seized upon the Cardinal <hi>Clesel,</hi> vvhen he vvas put into a Coach, and transported hence to <hi>Tirol:</hi> So as now vve may expect some Pamphlet the next Mart from <hi>Ingolstat,</hi> or <hi>Colen;</hi> That no man can end vvell, vvho hath laid violent hands upon any of those <hi>Roman Purpurati.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this point, I must adde two remarkable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances; The first, that <hi>Tampier,</hi> among other Papers found in his Pockets, is said to have had a Memorial of certain Conditions, vvhereon it should be fit to insist in his Parley vvith the Town, as having already swallowed the Castle. The other, that his Head having been cut off by a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and sold for five Dollars to another, vvho meant to have the merit of presenting it to the Prince, the Presenter vvas rewarded vvith a stroke of a Sable, for insulting over the dead Carkass of a Gentleman of Honour.</p>

                     <p>I Have your Lordships Letters dated the 20th. of <hi>October,</hi> and I have withal by the care of my Cousin Mr. <hi>Thomas Meawtis,</hi> and by your own special favour, three Copies of that Work, wherewith your Lordship hath done a great and ever-living benefit to all the children of Nature; and to Nature her self, in her uttermost extent and latitude: who never before had so noble nor so true an Interpreter, or (as I am readier to style your Lordship) never so inward a Secretary of her Cabinet: But of your said Work (which came but this Week to my hands) I shall find occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to speak more hereafter; having yet read only the first Book thereof, and a few Aphorismes of the second. For it is not a Banquet, that men may su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficially taste, and put up the rest in their Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets;
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:102693:195"/>
but in truth, a solid feast, which requireth due mastication. Therefore when I have once my self perused the whole, I determine to have it read piece by piece at certain hours in my domestick Colledge, as an ancient Author: For I have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus much by it already, that we are extreamly mistaken in the computation of Antiquity, by searching it backwards, because indeed <hi rend="margQuotes">the first times were the youngest; especially in points of natural discovery and experience.</hi> For though I grant, that <hi>Adam</hi> knew the natures of all Beasts, and <hi>Solomon</hi> of all Plants, not only more then any, but more then all since their time; Yet that was by divine infusion, and therefore they did not need any such <hi>Organum</hi> as your Lordship hath now deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the world; nor we neither, if they had left us the memories of their wisdom.</p>
                     <p>But I am gone further then I meant in speaking of this excellent Labour, while the delight yet I feel, and even the pride that I take in a certain Congeniality (as I may term it) with your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships studies, will scant let me cease: And indeed I owe your Lordship even by promise (which you are pleased to remember, thereby doubly binding me) some trouble this way; I mean, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of <hi>Philosophical</hi> Experiments, which surely, of all other, is the most ingenuous Traffick: Therefore, for a beginning, let me tell your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship a pretty thing which I saw coming down the <hi>Danuby,</hi> though more remarkable for the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then for the Theory. I lay a night at <hi>Lintz,</hi> the Metropolis of the higher <hi>Austria;</hi> but then in very low estate, having been newly taken by the Duke of <hi>Bavaria:</hi> who, <hi>blandiente fortunà,</hi> was gone on to the late effects: There I found <hi>Keplar,</hi>
                        <pb n="300" facs="tcp:102693:196"/>
a man famous in the Sciences, as your Lordship knows, to whom I purpose to convey from hence one of your Books, that he may see we have some of our own that can honour our King, as well as he hath done with his <hi>Harmanica.</hi> In this mans stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy I was much taken with the draught of a Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skip on a piece of paper, me thoughts masterly done: whereof enquiring the Author, he bewrayed with a smile, it was himself; adding, he had done it, <hi>Non tanquam Pictor, sed tanquam Methemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</hi> This set me on fire: At last he told me how. He hath a little black Tent, (of what stuff is not much importing) which he can suddenly set up where he will in a Field, and it is convertible (like a Wind-mill) to all quarters at pleasure, capable of not much more then one man, as I conceive, and perhaps at no great ease; exactly close and dark, save at one hole, about an inch and a half in the <hi>Diameter,</hi> to which he applies a long perspective Trunk, with the convex-glass fitted to the said hole, and the concave taken out at the other end, which extendeth to about the middle of this erected Tent, through which the visible radiations of all the objects without, are intromitted, falling upon a paper, which is accommodated to receive them, and so he traceth them with his pen in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral appearance, turning his little Tent round by degrees, till he hath designed the whole Aspect of the Field. This I have described to your Lordship, because I think there might be good use made of it for Chorography: for otherwise, to make Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skips by it were illiberal; though surely no Painter can do them so precisely. Now from these artificial and natural curiosities, let me a little direct your Lordship to the contemplation of <hi>Fortune.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

Here, by a sleight Battel full of miserable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours (if I had leisure to set them down) all is reduced, or near the point. <hi rend="margQuotes">In the Provinces there is nothing but of fluctuation and submission, the ordinary consequences of Victory;</hi> wherein the triumphs of the Field do not so much vex my soul, as the triumphs of the Pulpit: For what noise will now the Jesuite disseminate more in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then <hi>victrix causa Deo placuit;</hi> which yet was but the Gospel of a Poet: No, my Lord, when I revolve what great things <hi>Zisca</hi> did in the first troubles of his Countrey, that were grounded upon conscience, I am tempted to believe the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinguishing eye hath been more displeased with some humane affections in this business, then with the business it self.</p>
                     <p>I am now preparing my departing toward my other imployment, for in my first Instructions I had a power to go hence, when this controversie should be decided, either by Treaty, or by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; whereof now the worser means have perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the better.</p>
                     <p>Here I leave the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors upon the Stage, as I found them; being willing <hi>(quod solum superest)</hi> to deal between the Emperour and <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem Gabor,</hi> with whom I have nothing to do as he is now singled.</p>
                     <p>Betwixt this and <hi>Italy</hi> I purpose to collect the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morablest Observations that I have taken of this great Affair, and to present a Copy thereof unto your Lordships indulgent, not to your severe judgement.</p>
                     <p>The present I cannot end (though I have too much usurped upon your precious time) without the return of my humble thanks unto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,

both for your love to my dearest Nephew, and for your gracious remembrances of mine own poor Name) I thought it even a particular duty to my self, to acquaint your Lordships Secretary, my ancient and worthy Friend, with the Story of mine own evils, that your Lordship may know my silence to have been, as I may well term it, a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome of my infirmity.</p>

                     <p>HAving not long written unto you, whose Friendship towards me hath given you a great interest in me; I send you a Report of a late Transaction, even for a little entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:102693:199"/>
lest you should think me to live without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</p>
                     <p>For that the Case of the late Cavalier <hi>Antonio Foscarini</hi> hath been diversly mis-reported, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not the least, even by those that were his Judges, to cover their own disgrace, I have thought a little curiosity not ill spent in research of the whole Proceeding, that his Majesty (to whom he was so well known) may have a more due infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this rare and unfortunate example. There is among the partitions of this Government a very awfull Magistracy under Title of <hi>Inquisitori di Stato;</hi> to which are commonly deputed three Gentlemen of the gravest and severest natures, who receive all secret Delations in matter of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice against the Republick, and then refer the same, as they shall judge the consequence thereof, to the Decemviral Councel, being the supreamest Tribunal in criminal Enquiries; of which Body they are usually themselves.</p>
                     <p>To these Inquisitors, about the beginning of <hi>April</hi> last, came two Fellows of mean condition, born about the <hi>Lago di Garda,</hi> but Inhabitants in <hi>Venice,</hi> by name <hi>Girolamo</hi> and <hi>Domenico Vani;</hi> as some say, Uncle and Nephew: certainly near of kindred, which in this report is a weighty circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; for thereby they were the likelier to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire, and consequently their united testimonies of the less validity. These Persons capitulate with the Inquisitors of that time (whose names may be civilly spared) about a reward (vvhich is usual) for the discovery of some Gentlemen, vvhich at undue times, and in disguised Forms, did haunt the Houses of Forraign Ministers, and in particular, of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Agent: vvho being the most obnoxious to
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:102693:200"/>
Publick jealousie, these Accusers vvere likeliest upon that Subject to gain a favourable hearing. In the head of their secret List, they nominate <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio Foscarini,</hi> then an actual Senator, and thereby upon pain of death restrained from all conference in this ombragious State vvith publick Instruments, unless by special permission. To verifie their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, besides their own testimonies, they alledge one <hi>Giovan Battista,</hi> vvho served the foresaid <hi>Spanish</hi> Agent, and had, as they said, acquainted them with the accesses of such and such Gentlemen unto him. But first they vvished, or so the Inquisitors thought fit, to proceed against <hi>Foscarini,</hi> upon this double attestation, vvithout examining the foresaid <hi>Giovan Battista;</hi> because that vvould stir some noise, and then perhaps those other, vvhom they meant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, might take fear and escape: Hereupon <hi>Fos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carini,</hi> coming from the next Senate at night down the Palace, vvas by order of the Inquisitors sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly muffled, and so put in close Prison, and after usual examinations, his own single denial being not receivable against two agreeing Informers, he vvas by sentence at the Councel of <hi>Ten,</hi> some fifteen days after his retention, strangled in Prison, and on the 21. of the foresaid <hi>April,</hi> vvas hanged by one leg on a Gallows in the publick <hi>Piazza,</hi> from break of day till Sun-set, vvith all imaginable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of infamy: his very face having been bruised by dragging on the ground, though some did conster that for a kind of favour, that he might be the less known.</p>
                     <p>After this the same Artificers pursue their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, novv animated vvith success; and next they name <hi>Marco Miani.</hi> But one of the Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, either by nature more advised then the rest,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:102693:200"/>
or intenerated vvith that vvhich vvas already done, vvould by no means proceed any farther, vvithout a pre-examination of the foresaid <hi>Giovan Battista:</hi> vvhich novv might the more conveniently, and the more silently be taken, because he had left the house of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Agent, and was married in the Town to a Gold-smiths Daughter. To make short, they dravv this man to a secret account; vvhere he doth not only disavovv the having ever seen any Gentleman in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Agents house, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise all such interest as the Accusers did pretend to have in his acquaintance, having never spoken vvith any of them, but only three vvords by chance with the elder, namely <hi>Girolamo,</hi> upon the <hi>Piazza di S<hi rend="sup">t.</hi> Stephano.</hi> Hereupon the Inquisitors confronted him vvith the Accusers; they confess vvithout any torture their malicious Plot, and had sentence to be hanged, as vvas afterwards done. But now the voice running of this detection, the Nephews of the executed <hi>Cavalier,</hi> namely <hi>Nicolo</hi> and <hi>Girolamo Foscarini,</hi> make haste to present a Petition (in all opinion most equitable) to the Decemviral Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, That the false Accusers of the abovesaid <hi>Marco Miani,</hi> might be re-examined likewise about their Uncle. The Counsel of <hi>Ten,</hi> upon this Petition, did assemble early in the morning, which had not been done in long time before; and there they put to voices, Whether the Nephews should be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?</p>
                     <p>In the first <hi>Ballotation,</hi> the <hi>Balls</hi> were equal: in the second, there was one <hi>Ball</hi> more (as they say) in the negative <hi>Box:</hi> Either because the false Witnesses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now condemned men, were disabled by course of Law to give any farther testimony, or for that the Councel of <hi>Ten</hi> thought it wisdom to smother an
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:102693:201"/>
irrevocable error. The Petition being denied, no possible way remained for the Nephews to clear the defamation of their Uncle (which in the rigour of this Government, had been likewise a stop to their own Fortunes) but by means of the Confessor, to whom the <hi>Delinquents</hi> should disburthen their souls before their death; and by him, at impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the said Nephews, the matter was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed: Whereupon did ensue a solemn Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Councel of <hi>Ten,</hi> touching the innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the foresaid <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>thonio Foscarini,</hi> eight months and twenty five days after his death. Whether in this case there were any mixture of private passion, or that perhaps some light humours, to which the Party was subject, together with the taint of his former Imprisonment, might precipitate the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of the Judges, I dare not dispute: But surely in 312. years that the Decemviral Tribunal hath stood, there was never cast upon it a greater blemish; which being so high a Piece, and on the reputation of whose grave and indubitable proceedings the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of manners hath most depended, is likely to breed no good consequence upon the whole. Since the foresaid Declaration, the Nephews have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved the body of their Uncle from a place where condemned Persons are of custom interred, to the Monument of their <hi>Ancestors</hi> in another Temple, and would have given it a solemn Burial: But having been kept (though rather by disswasion then prohibition) from increasing thereby the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Scandal, they now determine to repair his fame with an Epitaph, the last of miserable reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. It is said, that at the removing of his body, his heart was found whole: which kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits are easily entertained in this Country, and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:102693:201"/>
scant any notable case without some superstitious adjunct. It is said likewise, that by Testament he did appoint a great sum for him that should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his innocency: which receiving from cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Authors, I was willing not to omit; because it argueth, that notwithstanding some outward lightness, he was composed of generous Elements. Certain it is, that he left divers Legacies to the best Patriots, as now appeareth not artificially. But here I may breed a question, with which I will end this report: How a man in his case could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of his Fortune? I must answer, That in the composition of this State Confiscations are rare, be the Crime never so high, unless in case of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the publick Money; which the Delinquent is commonly condemned to repair, not so much in the quality of a Traitor, as of a Debtor. Whereof searching the reason, I find this to be the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate; That if in a Dominion meerly managed by their own Gentry, they should punish them as much in their means, as in their persons, it would in conclusion prove a punishment, not of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, but of the general: For it is a rule here, that the poorest Families are the loosest.</p>

                     <p>THese poor lines will be presented unto your Lordship by my Nephew (one of your obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Servants) and withal some description, as I have prayed him, of my long infirmities, which have cast me behind in many private, and often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:102693:202"/>
even my publick duties; with which yet I do rather seek to excuse some other defects of service, then my silence towards your Lordship. For to importune your Lordship seldome with my Pen is a choice in me, and not a disease, having resolved to live, at what distance soever from your sight, like one who had well studied before I came hither, how secure they are whom you once vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe any part of your love.</p>
                     <p>And indeed, I am well confirmed therein by your own gracious lines: for thereby I see that your Lordship had me in your meditation, when I scant remembred my self. In answer of which Letter, after some respite from mine own evils, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted my said Nephew to re-deliver my fortune into your Noble hands, and to assure your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that as it should be chearfully spent at your command, if it were present and actual, (from whose meditation I have derived it) so much more am I bound to yield up unto your Lordship an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute disposition of my hopes: But if it shall please you therein to grant me any part of mine own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, then I would rather wish some other satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction then exchange of office; yet even in this point likewise I shall depend on your will, which your Lordship may indeed challenge from me, not only by an humble gratitude, and reverence due to your most worthy Person; but even by that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural charity and discretion which I owe my self: for what do I more therein, then only remit to your own arbitrement the valuation of your own goodness? I have likewise committed to my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Nephew some Memorials touching your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships familear service (as I may term it) in matter of art and delight. But though I have laid these
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:102693:202"/>
offices upon another, yet I joy with mine own Pen to give your Lordship an account of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, worthier of your love, then I was of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to receive him from you. We are now, after his well-spent travels in the Towns of purer Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, married again till a second divorce; for which I shall be sorry, whensoever it shall happen. For in truth (my good Lord) his conversation is both delightful and fruitful; and I dare pronounce, that he will return to his Friends as well fraught with the best Observations, as any that hath ever sifted this Country; which indeed doth need sift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for there is both Flower and Bran in it. He hath divided his abode between <hi>Siena</hi> and <hi>Rome:</hi> the rest of his time was for the most part spent in motion. I think his purpose be to take the <hi>French</hi> Tongue in his way homewards, but I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with him to make <hi>Bruxels</hi> his seat, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Languages are familiar there; vvhereof the one vvill be after <hi>Italian</hi> a sport unto him, so as he may make the other a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: And for that the said Town is now the Scene of an important Treaty, which I fear will last till he come thither; but far be from me all ominous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. I will end with chearful thoughts and wishes; beseeching the Almighty God to preserve your Lordship in health, and to cure the Publick diseases. And so I ever remain</p>

                     <p>TO give your Lordship occasion to exercise your noble Nature, is withal one of the best exercises of mine own duty; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I am confident to pass a very charitable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through your Lordships hands and mediation to his Majesty.</p>
                     <p>There hath long lain in the Prison of Inquisition, a constant worthy Gentleman, <hi>viz.</hi> Master <hi>Mole:</hi> in whom his Majesty hath not only a right as his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but likewise a particular interest in the Cause of his first imprisonment: For having communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Majesties immortal work, touching the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance due unto Soveraign Princes, with a <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine</hi> of his familiar acquaintance, this man took such impression at some passages, as troubling his Conscience, he took occasion at the next shrift, to confer certain doubts with his Confessor; who out of malicious curiosity, enquiring all circumstances, gave afterwards notice thereof to <hi>Rome,</hi> whither the said <hi>Mole</hi> was gone with my Lord <hi>Ross;</hi> who in this story is not without blame: but I will not disquiet his Grave,</p>
                     <p>Now having lately heard that his Majesty, at the suit of I know not what Ambassadors, (but the <hi>Florentine</hi> amongst them is voiced for one) was pleased to yield some releasment to certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained Persons of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith; I have taken a conceit upon it, that in exchange of his Clemency therein, the great Duke would be easily moved, by the Kings gracious request, to interceed with the Pope for Master <hi>Mole</hi>'s delivery: To which
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:102693:203"/>
purpose, if it shall please his Majesty to grant his Royal Letters, I will see the business duely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued. And so needing no arguments to commend this proposition to his Majesties goodness, but his goodness it self, I leave it (as I began) in your Noble hand. Now touching your Lordships fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar service, (as I may term it) I have sent the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of your bargain, upon the best provided, and best manned Ship that hath been here in long time, called the <hi>Phoenix.</hi> And indeed the cause of their long stay, hath been for some such Vessel as I might trust. About which, since I wrote last to your Lordship, I resolved to fall back to my first choice: so as now the one Piece is the work of <hi>Titian,</hi> wherein the least Figure <hi>(viz.</hi> the Child in the Virgins lap playing with a Bird) is alone worth the price of your expence for all four, being so round, that I know not whether I shall call it a Piece of <hi>Sculpture,</hi> or <hi>Picture:</hi> and so lively, that a man would be tempted to doubt, whether Nature or Art had made it. The other is of <hi>Palma,</hi> and this I call the <hi>speaking Piece,</hi> as your Lordship will say it may well be termed; for except the Damsel brought to <hi>David,</hi> whom a silent modesty did best become, all the other Figures are in discourse and action. They come both distended in their Frames: for I durst not hazard them in Rowls, the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est being 25 years old, and therefore no longer supple and pliant. With them I have been bold to send a Dish of Grapes to your Noble Sister, the Countess of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> presenting them first to your Lordships view, that you may be pleased to pass your censure, whether <hi>Italians</hi> can make Fruits as well as <hi>Flemings,</hi> which is the common glory of their Pensils. By this Gentleman, I have sent the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:102693:204"/>
choicest <hi>Molon</hi> seeds of all kinds, which his Majesty doth expect, as I had Order both from my Lord of <hi>Holderness,</hi> and from Mr. <hi>Secretary Calvert.</hi> And although in my Letter to his Majesty (which I hope by your Lordships favour, himself shall have the honour to deliver, together with the said Seeds) I have done him right in his due Attributes; yet let me say of him farther, as <hi>Architects</hi> use to speak of a well chosen foundation, that your Lordship may boldly build what Fortune you please upon him, for surely, he will bear it vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously. I have committed to him for the last place, a private Memorial touching my self, wherein I shall humbly beg your Lordships intercession upon a necessary Motive.

                     <p>IN a late Letter from your Lordship by my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, I have, besides your own Favours, the Honour of Imployment from the King, in a piece of his Delight: which doth so consort with the opportunity of my Charge here, that it hath given me acquaintance with some excellent <hi>Florists,</hi> (as they are styled;) and likewise with mine own disposition, who have ever thought the greatest pleasure to consist in the simplest Ornaments and Elegancies of Nature; as nothing could fall upon me more happily. Therefore your Lordship shall see how I will endeavour to satisfie this Command. I had before Order by Mr. Secretary <hi>Calvert,</hi> to send his Majesty some of the best <hi>Melon-</hi>seeds of all kinds; which I have done some Weeks since, by other occasion of an express Messenger; and sent withall a very particular Instruction in the Culture of that Plant. By the present Bearer I do direct unto your Lordship, through the hands either of my Nephew, or Mr. <hi>Nicholas Pey</hi> (as either of them shall be readiest at <hi>London)</hi> for some begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in this kind of Service, the Stem of a double Yellow Rose, of no ordinary nature; For it flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereth every moneth (unless change of the Clime do change the property) from <hi>May,</hi> till almost <hi>Christmas.</hi> There hath gone such care in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Conveyance, as, if at the receiving, it be presently put into the earth, I hope it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper.

                     <p>Now for mine own Obligations unto your Lordship, (whereof I have from some Friends at home very abundant knowledge) What shall I say? It was in truth (my Lord) an argument of your noble Nature, to take my fortune into your Care, who never yet made it any great part of mine own business. I am a poor Student in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which hath redeemed me not only from the envying of others, but even from much solicitude about my self. It is true, that my most Gracious Master hath put me into civil practice, and now after long Service, I grow into a little danger of wishing I were worth somewhat: But in this likewise I do quiet my thoughts: For I see by your Lordships so free, and so undeserved estimation of me, that like the Criple, who had lain long in the Pool of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesda,</hi> I shall find some body that will throw me into the water when i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>My going to <hi>Oxford</hi> was not meerly for shift of air, otherwise I should approve your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel to prefer <hi>Boughton</hi> before any other part what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; that air best agreeing with me, and being a kind of resolving me into my own beginnings; for there was I born.</p>
                     <p>But I have a little ambitious vanity stirring in me, to Print a thing of my Composition there: which would else in <hi>London</hi> run through too much noise before hand, by reason of the Licences that must be gotten, and an eternal trick in those <hi>City-Stationers,</hi> to rumour what they have under Press.</p>

From <hi>Oxford</hi> I vvas rapt by my Nephevv, Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Bacon,</hi> to <hi>Redgrave,</hi> and by himself, and by my sweet Niece detained ever since: (so I say,) for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, there is in their conversations, and in the freedom of their entertainment, a kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful violence.</p>

                     <p>AS I gave Your Majesty fore-knowledge of my intention to enter into the Church, and had Your Gracious Approvement therein, so I hold it a second duty to Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and satisfaction to my self, to inform you likewise by mine own hand, both how far I have proceeded, and upon what Motives; that it may appear unto your Majesty (as I hope it will) an act of conscience, and of reason; and not of gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness and ambition. Your Majesty will be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pleased to know, that I have lately taken the degree of Deacon; and so far am I from aiming at any high flight, out of my former Sphear, that there I intend to rest. Perhaps I want not some perswaders, that measuring me by their affections, or by Your Majesties goodness, and not by mine own defects or ends, would make me think, that yet before I die, I might become a great Prelate. And I need no perswasion to tell me, that if I would undertake the Pastoral Function, I could peradventure by casualty, out of the Patronages belonging to Your Royal Colledge, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther troubling of Your Majesty, cast some good Benefice upon my self, whereof we have one, if it were vacant, that is worth more then my Provost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.

But shall I sit and do nothing in the Porch of Gods House, whereinto I am entred? God himself forbid, who was the Supream Mover. What Service then do I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to the Church? or what contentment to mine own mind? First, for the point of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I can now hold my place Canonically, which I held before but dispensatively, and withall I can exercise an Archidiaconal Authority annexed thereunto, though of small extent, and no benefit, yet sometimes of pious and necessary use. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort my self also with this Christian hope, That Gentlemen and Knights Sons, who are trained up with us in a Seminary of Church-men, (which was the will of the holy Founder) will by my example, (without vanity be it spoken) not be ashamed, after the sight of Courtly Weeds, to put on a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice. Lastly, I consider, that this resolution which I have taken, is not unsutable even to my civil imployments abroad, of which for the most part Religion was the Subject; nor to my observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have been spent that way in discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Roman</hi> Arts and Practices, whereof I hope to yield the World some account, though rather by my Pen, then by my Voice. For though I must humbly confess, that both my Conceptions and Expressions be weak, yet I do more trust my deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration then my memory: or if Your Majesty will give me leave to paint my self in higher terms, I think, I shall be bolder against the judgements,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:102693:210"/>
then against the faces of men. This I conceive to be a piece of mine own Character; so as my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Study must be my Theater rather then a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit; and my Books my Auditors, as they are all my Treasure. Howsoever, if I can produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else for the use of Church and State, yet it shall be comfort enough to the little remnant of my life, to compose some Hymnes unto his endless glory, who hath called me, (for which his Name be ever blessed) though late to his Service, yet early to the knowledge of his truth, and sense of his mercy.

                     <p>Good Sir, let us know some true passages of the plight of the Court. I have laid about for some constant intelligence from forraign parts, being strangely relapsed into that humour in my old age. Shall I tell you why? In good faith, for no other use that I mean to make of news, but only that when God shall call me to a better, I may know in what state I leave this World.</p>

                     <p>I Most humbly present (though by some infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties a little too late) a strange <hi>New-years Gift</hi> unto your Lordship, which I will presume to term the cheapest of all that you have received, and yet of the richest materials. In short, it is only an Image of your Self, drawn by memory from such discourse as I have taken up here and there of your Lordship, among the most intelligent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malignant men; which to pourtrait before you I thought no servile office, but ingenuous and real: and I could wish that it had come at the Day, that so your Lordship might have begun the <hi>New Year,</hi> somewhat like <hi>Plato</hi>'s definition of <hi>Felicity,</hi> with the contemplation of your own <hi>Idea.</hi>

They say, That in your forraign <hi>Employments</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der King <hi>James,</hi> your Lordship won the Opinion of a very able and searching Judgement, having been the first discoverer of the Intentions against the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> which were then in brewing, and masked with much Art. And that Sir <hi>Edward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> got the start of you both in Title and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at home, because the late Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> wanted then for his own Ends a Martial Secretary. They say, That under our present Soveraign, you were chosen to the highest charge at the lowest of the State, when some instrument was requisite of undubitable integrity and provident moderation; which <hi>Attributes</hi> I have heard none deny you. They discourse thus of your Actions since, that though great <hi>Exhaustions</hi> cannot be cured with sudden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, no more in a Kingdom then in a Natural Body, yet your Lordship hath well allayd those blu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering clamors wherewith at your beginnings your House was in a manner dayly besieged. They note, that there have been many <hi>changes,</hi> but that none hath brought to the <hi>Place</hi> a judgement so cultivated and illuminated with various <hi>Erudition</hi> as your Lordship, since the Lord <hi>Burghley</hi> under Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> whom they make your Parallel in the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Knowledge.</p>
                     <p>They observe in your Lordship divers remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able combinations of <hi>Vertues</hi> and <hi>Abilities,</hi> rarely sociable. In the <hi>Character</hi> of your <hi>Aspect,</hi> a <hi>mixture</hi> of <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Modesty.</hi> In the Faculties of your <hi>Mind,</hi> quick <hi>Apprehension</hi> and <hi>Solidity</hi> together. In the style of your <hi>Port</hi> and <hi>Train,</hi> as much <hi>Dignity,</hi> and as great <hi>Dependency</hi> as was ever in any of your <hi>Place,</hi> and with little noise or outward fume. That your <hi>Table</hi> is very abundant, free and noble, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:102693:213"/>
Luxury. That you are by nature no <hi>Flatterer,</hi> and yet of greatest power in <hi>Court.</hi> That you love <hi>Magnificence</hi> and <hi>Frugality</hi> both together. That you entertain your <hi>Guests</hi> and <hi>Visiters</hi> with noble cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, but void of complement. Lastly, that you maintain a due regard to your <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> and yet are an <hi>Enemy</hi> to frothy <hi>Formalities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, in the discharge of your <hi>Function,</hi> they speak of two things that have done you much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: namely, That you have had always a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care to the supply of the <hi>Navy:</hi> And likewise a more worthy and tender respect towards the <hi>Kings</hi> only <hi>Sister,</hi> for her continual support from hence, then she hath found before. They observe your greatness as firmly established as ever was any in the Love (and which is more) in the estimation of a <hi>King,</hi> who hath so signalized his own Constancy: Besides your addition of <hi>Strength</hi> (or at least of <hi>Lustre)</hi> by the Noblest <hi>Alliances</hi> of the Land.</p>
                     <p>Among these Notes, it is no wonder if some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, That between a good willingness in your affections to satisfie All, and an impossibility in the matter, and yet an importunity in the Persons, there doth now and then, I know not how, arise a little impatience, which must needs fall upon your Lordship, unless you had been cut out of a Rock of <hi>Diamonds,</hi> especially having been before so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant with liberal Studies, and with the freedom of your own Mind.</p>
                     <p>Now after this short <hi>Collection</hi> touching your most honoured Person, I beseech you give me leave to add likewise a little what Men say of the <hi>Writer.</hi> They say, I want not your gracious good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me according to the degree of my poor Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and Travels, but that I am wanting to my
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:102693:214"/>
self: And in good faith (my Lord) in saying so, they say truly; for I am condemned, I know not how, by nature, to a kind of unfortunate bashful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in mine own business, and it is now too late to put me in a new Furnace. Therefore it must be your Lordships proper work, and not only your Noble, but even your Charitable goodness that must in some blessed hour remember me. God give your Lordship many healthful and joyful years, and the blessing of that Text; <hi>Beatus qui attendit ad attenuatum.</hi> And so I remain with an humble and willing Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>THat was wont to be my style unto Your <hi>Majesty,</hi> which You see I have not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. For though I have a great while for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to trouble You with any of my poor lines; yet the memory of Your sweet and Royal Vertues, is the last thing that will die in me. In these months of my silence, I have been busie (if any work of my brains may be termed a business) about certain compositions of mine own, partly imposed, and partly voluntary: whereof some would fain be strugling into the light; but I do check their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness, because I am afraid they will be born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their time: in the mean while, I have gotten a subject worthy to exercise my pen unto Your
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:102693:214"/>
Majesty, which is the <hi>choice</hi> of the New Lord Treasurer; upon which <note place="margin">Mar. 6. 1635.</note> place Your Majesty hath alwayes some dependance in Your Domestick Affairs. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Your Majesty hath never personally seen him, therefore I will take the boldness to paint him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore You; though I must speak, as yet, more out of the universal opinion, then from my own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: for Your Majesty knows my nature, I am always one of the last intruders. Now the best and the shortest draught that I can make of him, vvill be this; There is in him no tumour, no sowre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, no distraction of thoughts, but a quiet mind, a patient care, free access, mild and moderate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers.</p>
                     <p>To this I must add a solid judgement, a sober plainness, and a most indubitable character of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in his very face: so as there needs not much study to think him both a good man, and a wise man. And accordingly is his Family composed; more order then noise, and his nearest Instruments carefully chosen, for he wanted no offers: But above all, there is a blessed note upon him, that his Majesty hath committed his Moneys, where he may trust his Conscience. Upon the whole matter, it is no marvel that the Charge lay a full year under Commission.</p>
                     <p>For the King himself (as we hear) did openly profess, that he had spent the most of that time, not in deliberating whom he might choose, but in woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him whom he had chosen, to undertake it: For it is a hard matter indeed (if so good a King had not been the Orator) to draw a man out of the settled repose of a learned Life, into such an ocean of publick Solicitude, able to swallow an ordinary
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:102693:215"/>
Spirit. But God, who hath raised him to it, hath made him fit for it.</p>
                     <p>This is all that I was in travel to advertise Your Majesty upon the present occasion; my next will be touching the two sweet Princes, Your Sons, whose Fame I have only hitherto enjoyed in the common Voice; having by some weakness in my Legs, and other symptomes of Age, and by mine own retired Studies, been confined to privacy: But I hope to make known unto Them, how much I reverence my Royal Mistress, their Mother, and the Images of her Goodness, at the solemn Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the next Moneth in <hi>Oxford:</hi> For an Academy will be the best Court for my humour.

I have further considered with my self, that the said place is not incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with that which I now hold by Your Majesties intercession with Your ever blessed Father, as it may please You to remember, though You forget nothing so easily as Your own bounties: which place here never before subsisting in the Memory of man, without some Addition, I have now near fourteen years sustained in that integrity as I found it, and with as good Scholars sent annually to Your Royal Colledge at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> of my particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

                     <p>IT was a special favour, when you lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon me here the first taste of your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, though no longer then to make me know that I wanted more time to value it, and to enjoy it rightly; and in truth, if I could then have imagined your farther stay in these parts, which I understood afterward by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> I would have been bold, in our vulgar Phrase, to mend my draught, (for you left me with an extream thirst,) and to have begged your conversation again joyntly with your said Learned Friend, at a poor meal or two, that we might have banded together some good Authors of the ancient time: Among which, I observed you to have been familiar.</p>
                     <p>Since your going, you have charged me with new Obligations, both for a very kind Letter from you, dated the 6th. of this Moneth, and for a dainty piece of entertainment that came therewith.

The subject of my Dispatch is as high as ever befel any forraign Minister; wherein, though mine own Conscience

Pardon me, Sir, a Question by the vvay, Have you no Child of your own, or at least of some of your Friends, vvhom you could vvish trained in this course?

                     <p>During my late Imployment, Sir <hi>E. P.</hi> then Master of the Rolls died. By his death Sir <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> claimed not only the Succession of that place, but the gift of all the Clerkships of the Chancery, that should fall void in his own time.</p>
                     <p>Of these Clerkships: Your Majesty had formerly granted two Reversions: The one to the late Lord <hi>Bruce;</hi> for which Mr. <hi>Bond,</hi> Secretary to my Lord Chancellour, had contracted with him. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to me. The said <hi>Bond</hi> got his Grant through the favour of his Master, to be confirmed by Sir <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> before his entrance into the Rolls: but through my absence in Your Majesties Service, and want of pressing it in the due season, my Grant remained unconfirmed, though Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty was pleased to write Your Gracious Letter in my behalf. Which maketh me much bewail mine own case, that my deserts were so poor, as Your Royal Mediation was of less value for me, then my Lord Chancellours for his Servant. The premisses considered, my humble Suit unto Your Majesty is this: That Sir <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> may be drawn by Your Supream Authority, to confirm unto me my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the second Clerkship, whereof I have a Patent under Your Great Seal. Wherein I have

<pb n="354" facs="tcp:102693:223"/>
so friendly, and so noble compassion, I had received a most irrecoverable ruine and shame, beyond all example, and my case would have been very strange; for I should have been undone by the Kings goodness, upon assurance whereof (though almost forgotten) I had increased my Train. Now Sir, this acknowledgement of your singular Love, I was never more fit to pay you then at the present, being intenerated in all my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward feelings and affections by new sickness, which with loss of much blood, even no less then twenty ounces within these fourteen dayes, hath brought me low. In which time (if God had called me from the Travels of this earth) I had left you, out of my narrow fortune, some poor remembrance of my thankfulness: which I have now (finding my self by Gods pleasure in a good way of recovery) transmitted to my above-said Friend Mr. <hi>Pey.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I end, I must not forget to ease your Honour of such thanks as in your Letters you have been pleased to bestow on me, in respect of your Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Mr. <hi>B.</hi> because his being with me, I do very rightly reckon among my bands to your self: for in good faith, his integrity and discretion doth sustain my House; besides his fellowship in certain Studies, wherein we aim at no small things, even perchance at a new <hi>Systeme</hi> of the World; at least, since we cannot in the Practical and Moral, I would we could mend it in the Speculative Part. But lest these private Contemplations (on which I am fallen) transport me too far, I will conclude as I began, with humble thanks for all your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; and with commending your Honoured Person to the Author of all Blessing; remaining ever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

You are pleased in your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to except my inconveniences, as if in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of your Nature (notwithstanding your desire) you would yet allow me here a liberty of mine own Judgement, or Affection. No, my Good Lord, That priviledge comes too late, even for your self to give me, when I once understand your mind. For let me assure your Lordship, that I have such a conscience, and real feeling of my deep Obligations towards your Noble Person, as no value nor respect under Heaven can purchase my voice from him, on whom you have bestowed it. It is true, that the King himself, and no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then three or four dayes before the date of your Letters (so nimble are the times) did write for another; but we shall satisfie his Majesty with a pre-election, and yours shall have my first nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; which, howsoever, will fall timely enough for him within the year.

There is born a small welcome to the King from <hi>Scotland</hi> (whom I have not yet seen since his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn) I know not how, out of a little indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They have sent us over from <hi>Leiden,</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> from <hi>Polonia,</hi> &amp;c. a tempest of <hi>Panegyricks,</hi> and <hi>Laudatives</hi> of their Princes; whereupon I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated with my self; What? Have we not as good a <hi>Theam</hi> and <hi>Theater</hi> as they? Or do we want Sense, or Zeal to express our Happiness? This stirred my very Bowels, and within a while my Pen, such as it is. I confess the Subject is so high, as I fear may condemn my Obscurity to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken it; but withall so true, as I hope vvill not mis-become mine ingenuity. Howsoever, I sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to your judgement: and if in charity you shall be pleased to like any thing in it, I humbly beseech you that you would be pleased to take some occasion of speaking favourably of it to the King himself; for though I aim at nothing by it, save the very doing of it, yet I should be glad to have it impressed by better judgements then my own; And so I most humbly rest,</p>

                     <p>I Had sooner given you an account of your two last kind Letters, even for mine own sake, upon whom otherwise you should have had just cause to bestow no more of your excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence; But that I have had this my servant (and I can assure you as much yours) every day upon his wings towards you a pretty while.</p>
                     <p>To abbreviate Complement, which never agreed with my Nature. In a few plain words, both my self, and all about me are yours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sir,</hi> I was glad by your last, to see in the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> Ruptures a Thread of Hope yet left. It is like an Instrument wholly out of tune, but yet not all the strings broken or cut; especially if it be true, which is here voiced with us, that my Lord —

a popular Orator, is sent thither to smooth the way towards a pacifical Treaty, between certain of the Kings Deputation, and others of the Covenant.</p>
                     <p>This Bearer will tell you what we hear of certain rumorous Surmises at <hi>N.</hi> and the Neighbouring Towns, God (who is himself the true Center of Rest) make us all quiet, and have you in his Love.</p>

                        <l>And feavers of desire, and pangs of love, which toyes remove.</l>
                        <l>Why, was she born to please, or I to trust, words writ in dust?</l>
                        <l>Suffering her Eyes to govern my despair, my pain for air;</l>
                        <l>And fruit of time rewarded with untruth, the food of youth.</l>

Untrue she was: yet, I believ'd her eyes (instructed spies)</l>
                        <l>Till I was taught, that Love was but a School to breed a fool.</l>
                        <l>Or sought she more by triumphs of denial, to make a trial</l>
                        <l>How far her smiles commanded my weakness? yield and confess,</l>
                        <l>Excuse no more thy folly; but for Cure, blush and endure</l>
                        <l>As well thy shame, as passions that were vain: and think, 'tis gain</l>
                        <l>To know, that Love lodg'd in a Womans brest, Is but a guest.</l>

                     <p>I Must now acknowledge it true which our Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators tell us, that there be indeed certain va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations of the Compass: for I think there was never point of a needle better touched then you have touched me, having ever since I parted from you, been looking towards you, and yet still by something or another, I am put out of my course.

                     <p>This is the first part of what I meant to say. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which I would fain tell you, That I send this Foot man expresly unto you to redeem some part of my fault, for not answering your late kind Letter by the Messenger that brought it: But the

truth is, I had some special occasion to send to <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> and therefore I will set no more upon your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, then his steps from thence to <hi>Redgrave,</hi> where perhaps you now are. See what a real Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier I am, and whether I be likely to prosper. Well, howsoever, let me entertain you a little by this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, with some of our discourses. The King departed yesterday from hence towards you; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as yet, notwithstanding much voice, and some wagering on the other side, determined nothing of the vacant places: Whereupon the Court is now divided into two opinions; the one; that all is reserved for the greater honour of the marriage; the other, that nothing will be done till a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or (to speak more precisely) till after a Parliament; which latter conceit, though it be spread without either Author or ground, yet as many things else of no more validity, it hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten faith enough on a sudden. I will leave this to the judicial Astrologers of the Court, and tell you a tale about a subject somewhat nearer my ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> last at night, and no longer, some sixteen Apprentices (of what sort you shall guess by the rest of the Story) having secretly learnt a new Play without Book., intituled, <hi>The Hog hath lost his Pearl;</hi> took up the <hi>White-Fryers</hi> for their Theatre: and having invited thither (as it should seem) rather their Mistresses then their Masters; who were all to enter <hi>per buletini</hi> for a note of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction from ordinary Comedians. Towards the end of the Play, the Sheriffs (who by chance had heard of it) came in (as they say) and carried some six or seven of them to perform the last Act at <hi>Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel;</hi> the rest are fled.

how sharp-witted the City is, for they will needs have Sir <hi>Iohn Swinerton</hi> the Lord <hi>Maior</hi> be meant by the <hi>Hog,</hi> and the late Lord Treasurer by the <hi>Pearl.</hi> And now let me bid you good night, from my Chamber in <hi>King-street</hi> this <hi>Tuesday,</hi> at Eleven of the night.</p>

                     <p>TO divert you from thinking on my faults, I will entertain you with some News out of a Letter which I have here received from <hi>Venice,</hi> of much consequence divers wayes.</p>
                     <p>The Bishop of <hi>Bamberge,</hi> a Practical <hi>Almain</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late (of which kind there be enough of that Coat, though not in that Countrey) was treating in <hi>Rome</hi> a League against the Protestant Princes of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> with whom His Majesty (you know) was first by Articles, and is now by alliance more nearly confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate: His Commission he had from the Emperour, <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>tto parole tacite</hi> as they call it. Now, while this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was there moulding, a <hi>Chiaus</hi> arrives at the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Court, with a Letter from the <hi>Turk,</hi>
                        <pb n="404" facs="tcp:102693:248"/>
importing a denuntiation of VVar, grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a heap of complaints easily found out between Princes that do not intend to agree. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the <hi>Turk</hi> is departed in Person from <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> into <hi>Hungary</hi> with great Forces (as my Friend writeth) on a morning <hi>quando nevicava a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> (by which appeareth the sharpness of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour) having made a leavy before his going of 5000 youths out of the <hi>Seragli;</hi> a thing never seen before. He hath left behind him <hi>Nasuf Bassa</hi> as President of his affairs, who told the <hi>Batolo</hi> of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> there resident, that his Master was but gone to hunt: and seemeth to have held the same language with the other Ambassadors: whether out of meet wantonness of conceit, or as esteeming a war with Christians, but a sport in respect of that which he had newly concluded with the <hi>Persian,</hi> I know not: howsoever, this is likely to quash the Bishops busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and I fear it will fall heavy upon <hi>Germany:</hi> which first in it self was never more dis-united; and besides, the Emperour in small good will with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>se that should help him. It will likewise in my conjecture hasten the departure of the Count <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> or at least (if it so please him) it may well serve his turn for that purpose.</p>
                     <p>This is all that I have for your entertainment: To morrow morning I depart hence towards <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> whence I determine to write by every Carrier to you, till I bring my self.</p>
                     <p>In your last, you mentioned a certain Courtier that seemeth to have spoken somewhat harshly of me; I have a guess at the man: and though for him to speak of such as I am, in any kind whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was a favour; yet I wonder how I am fallen out of his estimation, for it is not long since he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered

me a fair Match within his own Tribe, and much addition to her Fortune out of his private bounty. When we meet, all the world to nothing we shall laugh; and in truth, Sir, this world is worthy of nothing else. In the mean time, and ever, our sweet Saviour keep us in his love.</p>

                     <p>I Returned from <hi>Cambridge</hi> to <hi>London</hi> some two hours after the King. The next day was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with twenty Tilters, wherein there entred four fraternities: the Earls, <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gommery;</hi> my Lord <hi>Walden, Thomas</hi> and <hi>Henry Hawards;</hi> the two <hi>Riches,</hi> and the two <hi>Alexanders,</hi> as they are called (though falsly, like many things else in a Court.) The rest were <hi>Lenox, Arundel, Rutland, Dorset, Chandowes, North, Hey, Dingwel, Clifford,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Sommerset,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington.</hi> The day fell out wet to the disgrace of many fine Plumes. Some Caparisons seen before, adventured to appear again on the Stage with a little disguisement, even on the back of one of the most curious: So frugal are the times, or so indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. The two <hi>Riches</hi> only made a Speech to the King: the rest were contented with bare Imprese: wherof some were so dark, that their meaning is not
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:102693:249"/>
yet understood; unless perchance that were their meaning, not to be understood. The two best, to my fancy, were those of the two Earls Brothers: The first a small exceeding white Pearl, and the word, <hi>Solo candore valeo.</hi> The other a Sun casting a glance on the side of a Pillar, and the Beams re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting, with this Motto, <hi>Splendonte refulget.</hi> In which devices there seemed an agreement; the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother, to allude to his own nature, and the younger to his fortune. The day was signalized with no extraordinary accident, save only between Sir <hi>Thomas Haward,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Sommerset,</hi> who with a counter-buff had almost set himself out of the Saddle, and made the others Horse sink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him; but they both came fairly off without any further disgrace. Of the merits of the rest I will say nothing, my Pen being very unfit to speak of Launces.</p>
                     <p>To this solemnity, of the publick Ambassadors, only the Arch-duke was invited, for the healing of the distaste he had taken for the preference of the <hi>Venetian</hi> at the marriage. But I doubt the Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster be too narrow for the sore; which he seemed not much discontented that men should note in his whole countenance that day. Towards the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a challenge passed between <hi>Archie</hi> and a famous Knight, called Sir <hi>Thomas Parsons;</hi> the one a fool by election, and the other by necessity: which was accordingly performed some two or three dayes after, at Tilt, Tornie, and on foot both compleatly armed, and solemnly brought in before their Majesties, and almost as many other meaner eyes as were at the former. Which bred much sport for the present, and afterwards upon cooler consideration much censure and discourse, as the manner is.</p>

The Commissioners that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her, have the titles of Ambassadors, to give them precedency before Sir <hi>Ralph Winwood</hi> at the <hi>Hague;</hi> and likewise in any encounters with <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maign</hi> Princes. Sir <hi>Edward Cecil</hi> goeth as Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, to keep up that Office in the name; though it be otherwise perhaps from a General, rather a fall then an ascent. Before this journey there is a conceit, that the Duke of <hi>Lenox</hi> will be naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed a Peer of our Parliament, and my Lord of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> be created Earl of <hi>Devonshire.</hi> The forraign matter is little increased since my last unto you from <hi>Cambridge.</hi> The <hi>Savoy</hi> Ambassador not yet arrived. The <hi>Turks</hi> designs hitherto unknown, and marching slowly according to the nature of huge Armies: In which suspence the <hi>Venctians</hi> have augmented their guard in the Gulf: enough to confirm unto the world, that States must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, even with ridiculous fears.

                     <p>THe last week, by reason of my being in <hi>Kent,</hi> was a week of silence; and this I think will appear unto you a week of wonder.</p>
                     <p>The Court was full of discourse and expectation, that the King being now disincumbred of the care of his Daughter, would towards this Feast of St. <hi>George</hi> fill up either all or some at least of those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that had lien vacant so long, and had been in this time of their emptiness a subject of notorious opposition between our great Viscount and the House of <hi>Suffolk.</hi> Thus I say ran the opinion: When yesterday about six of the Clock at evening, Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> was from the Council-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber conveyed by a Clerk of the Council, and two of the Guard to the Tower; and there by War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant consigned to the Lieutenant as close Prisoner: Which both by the suddenness, like a stroke of Thunder, and more by the quality and relation of the person, breeding in the Beholders (whereof by chance I was one) very much amazement; and being likely in some proportion to breed the like in
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:102693:250"/>
the Hearers, I will adventure for the satisfying of your thoughts about it, to set down the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running and leading Causes of this accident, as far, as in so short a time I have been able to wade in so deep a water. It is conceived that the King hath a good while been much distasted with the said Gentleman, even in his own nature, for too stiff a carriage of his fortune; besides that scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous offence of the Queen at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> which was never but a palliated cure. Upon which conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, His Majesty resolving to sever him from my Lord of <hi>Rochester,</hi> and to do it not disgraceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or violently, but in some honourable fashion; He commanded not long since the Arch-Bishop by way of familiar discourse, to propound unto him the Ambassage of <hi>France,</hi> or of the Arch-Dukes Court; whereof the one was shortly to be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the other at the present vacant: In which proposition it seemeth, though shadowed under the Arch-Bishops good will, that the King was also contented some little light should be given him of His Majesties inclination unto it, grounded upon his merit. At this the Fish did not bite; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the King took a rounder way, commanding my Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> to propound joyntly the same unto him (which the Arch-Bishop had before moved) as immediately from the King, and to sweeten it the more, he had (as I hear) an offer made him of assurance before his going off the place, of Treasurer of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which he expecteth after the death of the Lord <hi>Stanhop;</hi> whom belike the King would have drawn to some reasonable composition. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all which Motives and impulsives, Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> refused to be sent abroad, with such
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:102693:251"/>
terms, as vvere by the Council interpreted preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of contempt, in a Case vvhere the King had opened His vvill; vvhich refusal of his, I should for my part esteem an eternal disgrace to our occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, if vvithall I did not consider how hard it is to pull one from the bosome of a Favourite. Thus you see the point upon vvhich one hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted standing in the second degree of power in the Court, and conceiving (as himself told me but two hours before) never better then at that present of his own fortunes and ends. Now in this vvhole matter, there is one main and principal doubt, vvhich doth travel all understandings; that is, <hi>Whether this were done without the participation of my Lord of</hi> Rochester: A point necessarily infol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding two different consequences; for if it vvere done vvithout his knowledge, vve must expect of himself either a decadence or a ruine; if not, vve must then expect a reparation by some other great publick satisfaction, vvhere of the vvorld may take as much notice. These clouds a few dayes vvill clear: In the mean vvhile I dare pronounce of Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury,</hi> that he shall return no more to this Stage, <hi rend="margQuotes">unless Courts be governed every year by a new Philosophy, for our old Principles vvill not bear it.</hi>

                     <p>Of his case whose love drew him into it, I can yet make no judgement: The humour seemeth to be sharp, and there is wisdom enough in those that have the handling of the Patient to manage the matter, so that at length his banishment from the Court may be granted as a point of grace.

Yesterday his Father petitioned the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:102693:253"/>
King (as he came from the Chappel) that his Son might have a Physician, and a Servant allowed him, as being much damaged in his health by close im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment: vvhich for my part I believe, for the diseases of Fortune have a kind of transfusion into the body, and strong vvorking spirits vvanting their usual objects, revert upon themselves; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the nature of the mind being ever in motion, must either do or suffer.</p>
                     <p>I take pleasure (speaking to a Philosopher) to reduce (as near as I can) the irregularities of Court <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>o constant principles. Novv to return to the matter: The King hath granted the Physician, but denied the Servant: by vvhich you may guess at the issue; for vvhen graces are managed so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly by a King, otherwise of so gracious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it doth in my opinion very clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the asperity of the offence.

                     <p>The <hi>Savoy</hi> Ambassador seemeth in his second Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to have discharged all his Commission; or otherwise he vvanteth authority to proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to a general overture, till the arrival of the Cavalier <hi>Battista Gabaleoni,</hi> vvho is hourly expected, and is here to remain as Resident for the said Duke.</p>
                     <p>With him likewise come certain other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Title, vvho should from the beginning have dignified the Ambassadors Train: but the cause of this stragling, vvas a sudden attempt, vvhich the Duke immediately after the Ambassadors departure (vvho appointed those Gentlemen to follovv him) made upon the Marquisat of <hi>Monferato,</hi> vvhere he surprized three Towns vvith the Petarde: the first time (as one writeth from <hi>Venice)</hi> that ever that pestilent invention had been put in practice beyond the Alps.</p>

to the foresaid vvhole Marquisat; and clearly to all the moveables left by the late Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> her Father, vvho died intestat.

                     <p>J do as unwillingly put my Pen to tell you, as I am sure you will be to hear, vvhat hath befallen my Nephew <hi>Albertus</hi> this week. He was going on <hi>Friday</hi> last towards evening in a Coach alone, whose driver alighting (I know not upon what occasion) hard by <hi>Charing-Cross,</hi> the Horses (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing young) took some affrightment, and running away so furiously, that one of them tore all his belly open upon the corner of a Beer Cart; my Nephew (who in this mean while adventured to leap out) seemeth to have hung on one of the pins of the Boot, from whence strugling to get loose, he brake the waste-band of his Hose behind, and so fell with the greater violence on the ground, hurting only the hindermost part of his head, by what possibility we cannot conceive, unless the motion of the Coach did turn him round in the fall. The force of the concussion took from him
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:102693:256"/>
for some hour or thereabouts, the use of his voice and sense, which are now well restored; only, there yet remaineth in his left arm a kind of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical stupefaction, and his right eye-lid is all black with some knock that he took in the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Coach; which peradventure may have been the motive to make him leap out. But these external evils do not so much trouble us, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pungent and pulsatory ach withing the skull, somewhat lower then the place of his hurt; which hath continued more or less since his fall, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding twice letting blood, and some nights of good rest, and shaving of his head for the better transpiration; which we doubt the more, because it cometh <hi>sine ratione,</hi> his hurt being only in the fles<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>y part, and very sleight, without fracture of the skull, without inflammation, without any Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and all the principal faculties, as memory, discourse, imagination untainted. The King hath in this time much consolated us both with sending unto him, and with expressing publickly a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous feeling of his case: but we must fetch our true comforts from him, who is Lord of the whole; and so I leave it.</p>
                     <p>Since my last unto you, I am sure you hear how Sir <hi>Robert Mansfield</hi> hath been twice or thrice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented before the Lords, and committed to the <hi>Marshalsie;</hi> partly for having consulted with Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi> the Lawyer about the validity of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission drawn for a re-search into the Office of the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> whereof himself is an Accomptant; and partly for denying to reveal the name of the said Lawyer his Friend, who before had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Fleet</hi> for another case much of the same nature. The point toucheth a limb of the
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:102693:256"/>
Kings Prerogative, and immediate Authority. Sir <hi>Robert Mansfield</hi>'s Answers (by report) had as much of the Philosopher, or of the Hermite, as of the Souldier, or Courtier; professing openly his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle care of this World, or of his own Fortunes in it: and divers other phrases of that complexion. Sir <hi>Thomas Overbury</hi> is still where he was, and as he was, without any alteration: The Viscount <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> yet no way sinking in the point of favour; which are two strange consistents.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>R. Drury</hi> runneth at the Ring, corbeteth his Horse before the Kings window, haunteth my Lord of <hi>Rochesters</hi> Chamber, even when himself is not there; and in secret divideth his observances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the House of <hi>Suffolk:</hi> And all this (they say) to be Embassador at <hi>Bruxels.</hi> So as <hi>super uta materia,</hi> I see appetites are not all of a kind: Some go to the Tower for the avoiding of that which another doth languish to obtain. I will end with my Paper, and by the next Carrier either tell you precisely when I shall see you, or prevent the telling of it. And so our sweet Saviour bless you and my dear Niece.</p>

                     <p>IN my last I told you, that the Ambassador of <hi>Savoy</hi> was to meet the Queen at <hi>Windsor,</hi> which pains she hath spared him by her own coming yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where I think she will settle her self a day or two before she admit him. Now, seeing the time of the Commencement at <hi>Cambridge</hi> so near as it is, and being able to determine of this Ambassadors departure within that space, I have resolved to take those Philosophical exercises in my way to you, hoping in the mean time to see <hi>Albertus</hi> admitted by Oath to a Clarkship of the Council, or at least to the next vacancy, for he is now strong enough again to swear.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Robert Mansfield,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whitlock</hi> were on Saturday last called to a very honourable hearing in the Queens Presence Chamber at <hi>Whitehall</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords of the Council, with intervention of my Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> the Lord chief Baron of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, and Master of the Rolls, the Lord chief Justice being kept at home with some infirmity. There the Attorny and Sollicitor first undertook Mr. <hi>Whitlock,</hi> and the Recorder (as the Kings Sergeant) Sir <hi>Robert Mansfield;</hi> charging the one as a Counsellor, the other as a questioner in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Kings Prerogative and Soveraignty, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occasion of a Commission intended for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>search into the administration of the Admiralty:
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:102693:258"/>
against vvhich the said Sir <hi>Robert Mansfield</hi> (being himself so principal an Officer therein) had sought some provision of advice, and, This vvas the summe of the charge; vvhich vvas diversly amplified. <hi rend="margQuotes">
                           <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> in his answer, spake more confusedly, then vvas expected from a Lawyer, and the Knight more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately, then vvas expected from a Souldier.</hi> There vvas likewise some difference noted, not only in the manner, but in the substance between them: For <hi>Whitlock</hi> ended his speech vvith an absolute confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own offence, and vvith a promise of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying himself hereafter in defence of the Kings prerogative. Sir <hi>Robert Mansfield</hi> on the other side, laboured to distinguish between the errour of his acts, and the integrity of his zeal and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King his Master: protesting he should hold it the greatest glory under Heaven to die at his feet, and that no man living should go before him, if there vvere occasion to advance his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; vvith some other such Martial strains, vvhich became him vvell. The conclusion of his speech had somewhat of the Courtier, beseeching the Lords, if the restraint he had endured vvere not in their judgements a sufficient punishment of his errour, that then they vvould continue it as long as it should please them, and add unto it any other affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of pain or shame vvhatsoever; provided that afterwards he might be restored again into his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties favour, and their good opinions. To tell you vvhat they all severally said that day, vvere to rob from the liberty of our discourse vvhen vve shall meet. In this they generally agreed, both Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors and Judges, to represent the humiliation of both the Prisoners unto the King in lieu of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and to intercede for his gracious pardon
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:102693:258"/>
Which vvas done; and accordingly the next day they vvere enlarged upon a submission under vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. This is the end of that business, at vvhich vvere present as many as the room could contain, and men of the best quality; vvhom the King vvas desirous to satisfie, not only about the point in hand, but in some other things that vvere occasionally awaked; vvhich I likewise reserve to our private freedom.</p>
                     <p>The Kings Officers are returned from my Lady <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> vvhom they left at <hi>Goltzheime</hi> the last of <hi>May,</hi> vvhere His Majesties expence did cease.

                     <p>WHereas I vvrote unto you, that I vvould be at <hi>Cambridge</hi> as on Saturday next; I am now cast off again till the Kings return to <hi>London,</hi> vvhich vvill be about the middle of the vveek fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. The delay grows from a desire of seeing <hi>Albertus</hi> his business setled before vve come unto you, vvhere vve mean to forget all the vvorld be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. Of this vve shall bring you the account.</p>
                     <p>Now, to let matters of State sleep, I vvill enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you at the present vvith vvhat hath happened this vveek at the Banks side. The Kings Players had a new Play, called <hi>All is true,</hi> representing some principal pieces of the Raign of <hi>Henry</hi> 8.
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:102693:260"/>
which was set forth with many extraordinary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of Pomp and Majesty, even to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Stage; the Knights of the Order, with their Georges and Garter, the Guards with their embroidered Coats, and the like: sufficient in truth within a while to make greatness very famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, if not ridiculous. Now, King <hi>Henry</hi> making a Masque at the Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi>'s House, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Canons being shot off at his entry, some of the Paper, or other stuff wherewith one of them was stopped, did light on the Thatch, where being thought at first but an idle smoak, and their eyes more attentive to the show, it kindled inwardly, and ran round like a train, consuming within less then an hour the whole House to the very grounds.</p>
                     <p>This was the fatal period of that vertuous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brique; wherein yet nothing did perish, but Wood and Straw, and a few forsaken Cloaks; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one man had his Breeches set on fire, that would perhaps have broyled him, if he had not by the benefit of a provident wit put it out with bottle Ale. The rest when we meet: till when, I protest every minute is the siege of <hi>Troy.</hi> Gods dear bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings till then and ever be with you.</p>

                     <p>AN express Messenger will ease us both of the trouble of a cypher: but I was in pain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I should send another, or be that Messenger my self, being now as near you as <hi>Royston,</hi> and scant able to obtain pardon of mine own severity for not passing farther; yet this may be said for me, that the present occasion required little noise; and besides, I am newly ingaged into some business, whereof I will give you a particular account, when I shall first have discharged that part which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to your self.</p>
                     <p>My Lord, my Brother, having been acquainted with the matter inclosed in your last to me, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched the very next day Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> down to <hi>Bough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> for such writings as had passed at your mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; which having consulted with his Lawyers, he found those things to stand in several natures, according to the annexed Schedule.</p>
                     <p>For the point of your coming up, he referreth that to your own heart; and I have only charge from him to tell you, that without any such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion as this, which seemeth to imply your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:102693:261"/>
respect of his Daughter, your own Person and conversation shall be ever most welcome and dear unto him.</p>
                     <p>As for my Lady, through whose knowledge, and myself, through whose hands you have passed this point of confidence, if you could behold us, and compare us with my Lord, you should see, though no difference in the reality, yet some in the fashion. For to him you must allow the sober forms of his age and place; but we on the other side are mad with gladness, at the hope we have now taken by this occasion of enjoying both you and my Niece this Winter at <hi>London;</hi> and we are contented to profess it as profusely as it is possible for a better Pen to set it down: Nay, for my part (who in this case have somewhat single) I flatter my self yet farther, that the Term (whereof not much now remaineth) will accelerate your coming; vvhich if you resolve, I pray then let me only by this Bearer know it, that I may provide you some fit Lodgings at a good distance from <hi>White-Hall,</hi> for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of blessed liberty, and avoidance of the comber of kindness; vvhich in troth (as vve have privately discoursed) is no small one. Novv touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my self.</p>
                     <p>It may please you, Sir, to understand, That the King, vvhen he vvas last at <hi>Hampton,</hi> called me to him, and there acquainted me vvith a general pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that he had to put me again into some use. Since vvhich time, the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador (and very lately) having at an Audience of good length besought His Majesty (I knovv not vvhether volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, or set on by some of our own) to disincum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber himself of frequent accesses by the choice of some confident Servant, to vvhom the said Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:102693:262"/>
might address himself in such occurrences as did not require the Kings immediate ear. It pleased him to nominate me for that charge, vvith more gracious commendation then it can beseem me to repeat, though I vvrite to a Friend in vvhose breast I dare depose even my vanities. But lest you should mistake, as some others have been apt to do here, in the present constitution of the Court (vvhich is very ombragious) the Kings end in this application of me, I must tell you, that it is only for the better preparing of my insufficiency and vveakness for the succeeding of Sir <hi>Thomas Edmunds</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> towards which His Majesty hath thought meet first to indue me vvith some knowledge of the <hi>French</hi> businesses, vvhich are <hi>in motu.</hi> And I think my going thither vvill be about <hi>Easter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you see (Sir) both my next remove, and the exercise of my thoughts till then; vvherewith there is joyned this comfort, besides the redemption from expence and debt at home (vvhich are the Gulfs that vvould swallovv me) that His Majesty hath promised to do something for me before I go.</p>
                     <p>I should novv, according to the promise of my last, tell you many things, vvherewith my Pen is swoln; but I vvill beg leave to defer them till the next opportunity after my coming to <hi>London:</hi> And they shall all give place novv to this one question; Whether there be any thing in this intended jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, that you vvill command?

                     <p>IT is both morally and naturally true, that I have never been in perfect health and chearfulness since we parted; but I have entertained my mind, when my body would give me leave, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the strangest thing that ever I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, commonly called in our Language (as I take it) <hi>a Parliament:</hi> which hath produced nothing but inexplicable Riddles, in the place of Laws. For first, <hi rend="margQuotes">it is aborted before it was born, and nullified after it had a being;</hi> insomuch as the Count <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi> (whose Naturalization was the only thing that passed in both Houses) is now again an Alien. And whereas all other Parliaments have had some one eminent quality that hath created a denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; some being called in our Records <hi>mad</hi> Parliaments, some <hi>merciless,</hi> and the like: This I think from two properties almost insociable or sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom meeting, may be termed <hi rend="margQuotes">the Parliament of greatest diligence, and of least resolution that ever was, or ever will be;</hi> For our Committies were as well attended commonly, as full Houses in former Sessions, and yet we did nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the forenoon nor after; whereof I can yield you no reason but this one, that <hi rend="margQuotes">our diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions were more then our main purposes;</hi> and some of so sensible nature, as took up all our reason, and all our passion, in the pursuit of them. Now, Sir, what hath followed since the dissolution of this Civil Body, let me rather tell you, then lead you back into any particularities of that which is passed.</p>
                     <p>It pleased His Majesty the very next morning to call to examination, before the Lords of His
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:102693:263"/>
Council, divers Members of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, for some Speeches better becoming a Senate of <hi>Venice,</hi> where the Treaters are perpetual Princes, then <hi rend="margQuotes">where those that speak so irreverently, are so soon to return</hi> (which they should remember) to the natural capacity of Subjects. Of these Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minants, four are committed close Prisoners to the Tower: 1. Sir <hi>Walter Chute:</hi> 2. <hi>John Hoskins:</hi> 3. One <hi>Wentworth</hi> a Lawyer: And 4. Mr. <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Nevil,</hi> second Son to my Lord of <hi>Abergaveny.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first made great shift to come thither: For having taken in our House some disgrace in the matter of the Undertakers (of whom he would fain have been thought one) <hi rend="margQuotes">to get the opinion of a bold man, after he had lost that of a wise;</hi> he fell one morning into a declamation against the times, <hi rend="margQuotes">so insipid, and so unseasonable, as if he had been put but out of his place for it of <hi>Carver,</hi>
                        </hi> (into which one of my Lord <hi>Admirals</hi> Nephews is sworn) I should not much have pitied him, though he be my Country-man. The second is in for more wit, <hi rend="margQuotes">and for licentiousness baptized freedom:</hi> For I have noted in our House, that <hi rend="margQuotes">a false or faint Patriot did cover himself with the shadow of equal moderation; and on the other side, irreverent discourse was called honest liberty</hi>: so as upon the whole matter, <hi rend="margQuotes">No excesses want precious names.</hi> You shall have it in <hi>Pliny</hi>'s language, which I like better then mine own translation; <hi>Nullis vitiis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunt pretiosa nomina.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third is a silly and simple creature, God himself knows: and though his Father was by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> at the time of a Parliament like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise put into the place where the Son now is; yet hath he rather inherited his fortune, then his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:102693:263"/>
His fault was, the application of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Texts in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> to the matter of impositions; and saying, that the <hi>French</hi> King was kill'd like a Calf, with such like poor stuff: against which the <hi>French</hi> Ambassador (having gotten know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it) hath formed a complaint, <hi rend="margQuotes">with some danger of his wisdom.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The last is a young Gentleman, fresh from the School, who having gathered together divers <hi>Latine</hi> Sentences against Kings, <hi rend="margQuotes">bound them up in a long Speech,</hi> and interlarded them with certain <hi>Cicero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> exclamations; as, <hi>O Tempora, O Mores.</hi>—Thus I have a little run over these accidents unto you, enough only to break out of that silence which I will not call a symptome of my sickness, but a sickness it self. Howsoever, I will keep it from being hectical; and hereafter give you a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of mine own observations. This vveek I have seen from a most dear Niece a Letter, that hath much comforted one Uncle, and a Postscript the other. Long may that hand move, which is so full of kindness. As for my particular, Take heed of such invitations, <hi rend="margQuotes">if you either love or pity your selves</hi>: For I think there was never Needle toucht with a Loadstone that did more incline to the North, then I do to <hi>Redgrave.</hi> In the mean time, we are all here well; and so our Lord Jesus preserve you there.</p>

                     <p>THe Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> having after a lingring Feaver, spent more spirits then a younger body could well have born, by the incision of a wennish tumour grown on his thigh, yesternight between eleven and twelve of the Clock departed out of this world: where, as he had proved much variety and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitude of fortune in the course of his life, so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure he hath prevented another change there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the opportunity of his end: For there vvent a general voice through the Court on Sunday last, upon the commitment of Doctor <hi>Sharp,</hi> and Sir <hi>Charles Cornwallis</hi> to the Tower, that he vvas some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhat implicated in that business; vvhereof I vvill give you a little account at the present, as far as I have been hitherto able to penetrate. <hi>John Hoskins</hi> (of vvhose imprisonment I vvrote unto you by the last Carrier) having at a re-examination been que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, vvhether he vvell understood the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of that <hi>Sicilian vesper,</hi> vvhereunto he had made some desperate allusion in the House of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, made answer (and I think very truly) that he had no more then a general information there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, being but little conversant in those Histories that lay out of the vvay of his profession: vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:102693:264"/>
being pressed to discover vvhence he then had received this information, since it lay not vvithin his own reading; he confessed to have had it from Doctor <hi>Sharp,</hi> vvho had infused these things into him, and had solicited him to impress them in the Parliament: And further, that <hi>Hoskins</hi> hereupon demanding vvhat protection he might hope for, if afterwards he vvere called into question; the said Doctor should nominate unto him, besides others, (vvhose names I vvill spare) that Earl vvho hath novv made an end of all his reckonings: assuring him of his assistance by the means of Sir <hi>Charles Cornwallis,</hi> vvith vvhom the Doctor vvas conjoyned in this practice. Thus came Sir <hi>Charles</hi> into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery: vvho being afterward confronted vvith the Doctor himself, though he could not (as they say) justifie his own Person, yet did he clear my Lord of <hi>Northampton</hi> from any manner of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing vvith him therein upon his Salvation: vvhich yet is not enough (as I perceive among the People) to sweep the dust from his Grave. Thus you see (Sir) the natural end of a great Man, and the accidental ruine of others, vvhich I had rather you should see in a Letter, then as I did on <hi>Sunday</hi> at <hi>Greenwich:</hi> vvhere it grieved my soul to behold a grave and learned Divine, and a Gentleman of good hopes and merits, carried away in the face of the vvhole Court, vvith most dejected counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and such a greediness at all vvindows to gaze at unfortunate spectacles.</p>
                     <p>The Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi> hath made three of his Servants his Executors, with a very vast power, as I hear; and for Overseers of his Will, my L. of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> my L. of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and my L. <hi>William Haward:</hi> To the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> he left all his Land (which will
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:102693:265"/>
amount to some 3000 <hi>l.</hi> of yearly revenue) besides three or four hundred to Mr. <hi>Henry Haward,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had before assured him at the time of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; but neither of them to enjoy a penny there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as yet this eight year: all which time he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the fruits of his estate shall be collected and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed in legacies and pious uses according to his will, which hath not yet been seen: but thus much as I have told you was understood before his expiration. To my Lord of <hi>Suffolk</hi> he hath left his House, but hath disposed of all the moveables and furniture from him: And it is conceived, that he died in some distastfull impression, which he had taken against him upon the voices that ran of my Lord of <hi>Suffolk</hi>'s likelihood to be Lord Treasurer; which place will now assuredly fall upon him; and the world doth contemplate my Lord of <hi>Rochester</hi> for Lord Privy Seal, and Lord Warden of the five Ports. As for the Lord Chamberlainship, it is somewhat more questionable between my Lord of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Knowls.</hi> A few dayes will determine these ambitions. In the mean time, I commit you, who have better objects, to the contemplation of them, and to the mercy of our loving God in all your wayes.</p>

                     <p>The Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> is still beheld as a Lord Treasurer, and that conjecture hath never fainted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>nce the very first rising of it. But it is thought, that the dignity of Privy Seal shall lye vacant as it did in the <hi>Cecilian</hi> times, and that the execution thereof with the title of Lord Chamberlain, shall be laid on my Lord of <hi>Sommerset;</hi> for if my Lord of <hi>Suffolk</hi> should remove from the Kings Privacy to a place of much distraction and cumber, without leaving a friend in his room, he might peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture take cold at his back: which is a dangerous thing in a Court, as <hi>Ruygomezde silva</hi> was wont to say, that great <hi>Artisan</hi> of Humours. Of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Five Ports,</hi> I dare yet pronounce nothing.
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:102693:266"/>
My Lord, my Brother, will none of it (as I heard him seriously say) though it were offered him, for reasons which he reserveth in his own brest: yet the late <hi>Northampton</hi> did either so much esteem it, or thought himself to receive so much estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from it, as he hath willed his Body to be laid in the Castle of <hi>Dover.</hi>

                     <p>I Have received from <hi>London</hi> the favourable lines wherewith you honoured me then near your departure; which you have somewhat allayed, with the promise of your return at the beginning of the next <hi>Term,</hi> which consorteth well with a change of my purpose to Christmas in <hi>Kent,</hi> born in me as I was reading your Letter: For what should I do there in such hast after the Nuptials, when I shall come so as well in Lent? Much ado there hath been towards the point of conclusion; like that Aphorism of <hi>Hyppocrates: Nox ante Chris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <hi>Iack Dinely</hi> is not yet arrived, but we expect him daily as Messenger from the Queen his Mistress, of her late happy delivery, after a foul report that had been maliciously thrown abroad of her miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage by a fall. The Doctor likewise as yet hath given me no answer; but I will quicken him, and put life I hope into the business.</p>

Among other discourse he shewed me a little excrescence that he hath beginning upon the uttermost ball of his eyes, a filmy matter, like the rudiment of a Pin and Web as they call it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon fell into my memory a secret that Mr. <hi>Bohan</hi> had told me his Mother knew: How to take away that evil in growth, and perchance much more in the infancy, with a Medicine applyed only to the Wrists. And I have heard your self likewise speak of a rare thing for that part. I beseech you (Sir) be pleased with all possible speed to entreat that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt from Mr. <hi>Bohan,</hi> to whom we shall both be much beholden for it. And Sir <hi>Gervase Clifton</hi> is already so possessed, that he both sayes and thinks, that nothing will cure him better then that which any way shall come through your hand unto him. No peace as yet with either of the Kings: The more wished I think with <hi>France,</hi> the likelier per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance with <hi>Spain.</hi> No Offices disposed in Court.

                     <p>You seem to have left the Town somewhat Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically, not to be near the noise of a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy morning on <hi>Munday</hi> last; at vvhich time the Parliament assembling again (vvhich you knovv had been silenced till that day) vvas then re-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed

by the Kings especial Command till <hi>Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> next: Whereupon the Lower-House fell into such heat (one passion begetting another) that the Speaker (vvho as discharged by the Royal Power, did refuse to read a kind of Remonstrance vvhich Sir <hi>Iohn Eliott</hi> had provisionally set down in Paper) vvas forced into the Chair. It is strange to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lubricity of popular favour: For he that before during this vvhole Session (if so vve may call it) and the former, vvas so highly commended, and even in this very act by some of the soundest and soberest of the House; yet vvith the general Body is so stript of all his credit in a moment, that I have hardly seen in any Chymical vvork such a precipitation. What hath insued, vvill be better told you by this good Captain. Some think the Parliament doth yet hang upon a thread, and may be stitched again together: But, that is an airy conceit in my opinion; yet the peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the preparations of <hi>France</hi> against us, are voyced so strongly, that I verily believe vve shall have a nevv summons.</p>

                     <p>I Know that between us there needs little comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for which I am for my part so unproper and so unmoulded, that I often neglect even civil duties; as well appeared by my coming from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> without taking leave of you: but yet I cannot be wanting unto your self, nor to the least of your name in any real service, for that were too much violence to my nature; therefore before my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Westminster,</hi> I wrote such Letters to the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> about your Spiritous <hi>Frank</hi> (as I hope, together with the good offices of the bearer thereof) will place him with the Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> when he hath taken the Buss.

But <hi>Iack Dinelies</hi> long stay at <hi>London</hi> for his dispatch, and at <hi>Gravesend</hi> for a wind, hath lost us time. We hear that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> upon the peazing of his affairs in <hi>Italy</hi> (where a palm of ground importeth him more then a Province a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad) was resolved to make the Marquess <hi>Spinola</hi> Governor of <hi>Milan,</hi> and that the Count <hi>Henry Vanden Berge</hi> should command the Armies in chief under the Infanta.

                        <hi>Bella plusquam Civilia,</hi> for you know he is near of blood to the Prince of <hi>Orenge,</hi> though he hath some a little nearer; for he hath one or two by his own Sister, as I remember they told me in his Town of <hi>Maestrick.</hi> The other employment of the Marquess, is a Counsel, plainly taken rather from necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then reason.

                     <p>I have my head towards <hi>Kent,</hi> vvith a hope to see you first there, and afterwards at our Election: which will be the third of <hi>August.</hi> And so vvith my humble and hearty remembrance to that best of Men, and noblest of Ladies, I rest</p>

                     <p>THe very truth is, your love hath prevented me: for I meant by <hi>Giovanni</hi> to give you some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what hath passed since our divorcement. When I had slept half an hour after you were gone from <hi>Darford,</hi> I found my self <hi>fresco come una rosa:</hi> but I awaked in a strange dream, that had seldom before befaln me in an Inn; finding nothing to be paid, not so much as for mine own Horses: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the reason was plain of the paleness of my water which you observed; for  <hi rend="margQuotes">none of the tincture of my gold was gone into the reckoning of the drink,</hi> as you had handled the matter.</p>
                     <p>At the top of <hi>Shooters-hill</hi> my Foot-man staid, as if he had been watching the Beacon rather then for me; and told me there were good provisions made at Sir <hi>Adam Newtons</hi> for you and me, <hi rend="margQuotes">with kind expectation of us both.</hi> But my self being desirous to reach <hi>Eton</hi> that night, as I did, (for my horses I see travel best upon another mans purse) I blanched the house, and sent thither by <hi>Giovanni</hi> a
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:102693:271"/>
fair excuse. True it is, we are much of a humour: <hi>Cento Bue</hi> will hardly draw us in a journey to any strange place.</p>
                     <p>At that time likewise <hi>Will</hi> brought me a Letter from Mr. <hi>Griffith,</hi> which had been expresly sent to <hi>Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And I have intimated beforehand to your <hi>Jack Dinely,</hi> your purpose to pass over the spiritous <hi>Frank</hi> as soon as you can trick him. We are now towards the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stival of our Election; wherein annually I make a <hi rend="margQuotes">shift to lose four or five Friends, and yet do my self no good;</hi> so as they are angry with me on the one side, and they laugh at me on the other.</p>
                     <p>I apprehend this year a great poverty of Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with us: for I came too late to exchange your Warrant; and my Lady <hi>Throckmortons</hi> will not serve my turn.</p>
                     <p>Since my coming, Mr. <hi>Turvil,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> practical man, of good erudition, hath passed a day or two with me, from vvhom I hear a shrewd point: That the oath of peace (which should have been taken between the two neighbouring Kings upon the same day) is put off for a moneth: I believe the stop be in <hi>France,</hi> to gain time to disturb our Treaty with <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Pim</hi> (a man whose ears are open) told me likewise yesterday a strange thing, that the Queen of <hi>Bohemia</hi> hath newly, being hunting, been chased away her self with some affrightment from <hi>Rhenen</hi> by certain Troops of the enemy that have passed the <hi>Isel.</hi>

                     <p>I Am sorry that your Cast of <hi>Bucknames</hi> cannot be served at this Election: for to choose one of them (and that must have been in a low place) had been discomfortable, they will flie best at ease to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Yet I have thought of a way the next year, in all event not to fail; which is, to divide them between <hi>Westminster</hi> and <hi>Eton.</hi> Their Election pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth ours some three weeks; and truly upon my late observation there, I must needs say, that School mouldeth good Scholers, and of certainer preferment to either of the Universities (for some go to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and some to <hi>Cambridge)</hi> then this; out of which the issue is always hard, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance not always<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> easie. Glad I am to hear by your Letter, that you have gotten so good a School-master, that they may be well mued in the mean while. Betwixt this and the next turn, I shall lay you down an infallible course for them. And this must content their good Father at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
                     <p>If your Masons Brother (who was here on <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day)</hi> had staid till the next morning, there was some practicable hope to have sped the Boy this year to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> but some unfortunate haste, and despair of so many places as fell open, carried him away.</p>
                     <p>If you had not intimated your own coming to <hi>London,</hi> you might perchance have been troubled vvith me in the Country: But I vvill novv lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish for the hour you promise this place of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you here; vvhere your Venison (vvhich vve enjoy by exchange from Master <hi>Vice-Chamberlain</hi>

                     <p>Now, Sir, After I had received and read your Letter, I took some dayes to deliberate vvhat I should do, and to let my judgement settle again vvhich vvas distracted vvith so kind a surprisal: should I use a feathered quill to vvrite unto you? or fly my self to <hi>Redgrave?</hi> for you had given me vvings.

                     </opener>
                     <p>BY beginning first with Philosophy, I will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Method of my nature, preferring it before the speculations of State.</p>
                     <p>Take any Vegetable whatsoever, (none excepted in the effect, though some difference in the degree) express the juyce; put that in any vessel of Wood or Stone, with a narrow neck and mouth, not closed at the top, but covered with any thing, so as it may work out above: Set it afterwards in some cold hole in a Cellar, let it stand there some three weeks, or a moneth, till by fermentation it have both purged it self upwards, and by sediment down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Then decant from it the clear juyce, and put that in a Limbeck <hi>in Balneo Maris,</hi> or <hi>in Balneo Roris.</hi> The first that riseth will be <hi>Aqua ardens,</hi>
                        <pb n="455" facs="tcp:102693:274"/>
useful perchance according to the quality of the Plant; as of Wormwood for the Stomach, of Succory, or any of those <hi>Incubae,</hi> for the Liver: And on the sides of the Limbeck will hang a Salt; this is the extracting of Salt without calcination; which otherwise certainly must needs consume all the active powers of any Vegetable, and leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a palastick and passive vertue.</p>
                     <p>For the point of preserving that Salt afterwards from resolution by Air into Water, I hold it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, notwithstanding the proper examples that you alledge; which yet must of necessity yield to it. For as your excellent Uncle says, and says well, in not the least of his works (though born after him) of his Experiments; <hi>Air is predatory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have forgotten (for <hi>memoria primò senescit)</hi> whether I told you in my last a pretty late expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment in <hi>Arthritical</hi> pains: it is cheap enough. Take a rosted Turnip (for if you boyl it, it will open the pores, and draw too much) apply that in a Poultice to the part affected, with change once in an hour or two, as you find it dried by the heat of the flesh, and it will in little time allay the pain.</p>
                     <p>Thus much in our private way, wherein I dare swear, if our Medicines were as strong as our wishes, they would work extreamly.</p>
                     <p>Now, for the Publick, where peradventure now and then there are distempers as well as in natural bodies.</p>
                     <p>The Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> vvas on <hi>Saturday</hi> last (the day after your Posts departure) very solemnly restored at Council - Table (the King present) from a kind of Eclipse, wherein he had stood since the <hi>Thursday</hi> fortnight before: All considered, the
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:102693:275"/>
obscuration vvas long, and bred both various and doubtfull discourse; but it ended vvell. All the cause yet known, vvas a verbal challenge sent from him by Mr. <hi>Henry Germain</hi> in this form to the now Lord <hi>Weston,</hi> newly returned from his forraign imployments, That since he had already given the King an account of his Embassage, he did now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from him an account of a Letter of his, vvhich he had opened in <hi>Paris,</hi> and he did expect it at such a time, even in the <hi>Spring garden</hi> (close under his Fathers Window, vvith his Sword by his side.</p>
                     <p>It is said (I go no farther in such tender points) that my Lord <hi>Weston</hi> sent him by Mr. <hi>Henry Percy</hi> (between vvhom and the said Lord <hi>Weston</hi> had in the late journey (as it seems) been contracted, such friendship as overcame the memory that he vvas Cousin-German to my Lord of <hi>Holland)</hi> a very fair and discreet answer: That if he could chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge him for any injury done him before, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Embassage, he vvould meet him as a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, vvith his Sword by his side vvhere he should appoint. But for any thing that had been done in the time of his Embassage, he had already given the King an account thereof, and thought himself not accountable to any other. This published on <hi>Thursday</hi> vvas fortnight, the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> vvas confined to his Chamber in Court, and the next day morning to his House at <hi>Kensington,</hi> vvhere he remained vvithout any further circumstance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint or displeasure <hi>Saturday</hi> and <hi>Sunday:</hi> on vvhich dayes being much visited, it vvas thought fit on <hi>Munday</hi> to appoint Mr. <hi>Dickenson</hi> one of the Clerks of the Council, to be his Guardian thus far, that none vvithout his presence should accost him. This made the vulgar judgements run high, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:102693:275"/>
indeed run low, That he vvas a lost and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded man, judging as of Patients in Feavers, by the exasperation of the fits. But the Queen, vvho vvas a little obliquely interested in this business; for in my Lord of <hi>Holland</hi>'s Letter, vvhich vvas opened, she had one that vvas not opened, nor so much (as they say) as superscribed; and both the Queen's and my Lord of <hi>Holland</hi>'s vvere inclosed in one from Mr. <hi>Walter Mountague</hi> (vvhereof I shall tell you more hereafter.) The Queen I say, stood nobly by him, and as it seems pressed her own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front. It is too intricately involved for me so much as to guess at any particulars. I hear gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally discoursed, that the opened dispatch vvas on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in favour (if it might be obtained) of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de Chateau Neuf,</hi> and the <hi>Chevalier de Jarr;</hi> (vvho had both been here) but vvritten vvith caution (and surely not vvithout the Kings know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) to be delivered, if there vvere hope of any good effect; and perchance not vvithout Order from His Majesty to my Lord <hi>Weston</hi> afterwards, to stop the said Letters, upon advertisement that both <hi>Chateau Neuf,</hi> and <hi>de Jarr</hi> vvere already in the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stille.</hi> But this I leave at large, as not knowing the depth of the business.</p>
                     <p>Upon <hi>Munday</hi> vvas seven-night fell out another quarrel, nobly carried (branching from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) between my Lord <hi>Fielding</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goring,</hi> Son and Heir to the Lord of that Name. They had been the night before at Supper, I know not vvhere, together; vvhere Mr. <hi>Goring</hi> spake some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in diminution of my Lord <hi>Weston,</hi> vvhich my Lord <hi>Fielding</hi> told him, it could not become him to suffer, lying by the side of his Sister. Thereupon, these hot hearts appoint a meeting next day morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:102693:276"/>
themselves alone, each upon his Horse. They pass by <hi>Hide-Park,</hi> as a place vvhere they might be parted too soon, and turn into a Lane by <hi>Knights-bridge;</hi> vvhere having tyed up their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses at a Hedge or Gate, they got over into a Close; there stripped into their Shirts, vvith single Rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they fell to an eager Duel, till they vvere se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Host and his servants of the Inne of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> vvho by meer chance had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken some notice of them. In this noble encounter; vvhere in blood vvas spent, though (by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence) not much on either side, there passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them a very memorable interchange of a piece of courtesie, if that vvord may have room in this place: Sayes my Lord <hi>Fielding,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goring,</hi> If you leave me here, let me advise you not to go back by <hi>Piccadillia-hall,</hi> lest if mischance befall me, and be suddenly noised (as it falleth out in these occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons now between us) you might receive some harm by some of my friends that lodge thereabouts.</p>
                     <p>My Lord (replyes <hi>Goring)</hi> I have no vvay but one to answer this courtesie: I have here by chance in my Pocket a Warrant to pass the Ports out of <hi>England,</hi> vvithout a Name (gotten, I suppose, upon some other occasion before,) If you leave me here, take it for your use, and put in your own Name. This is a passage much commended between them, as proceeding both from sweetness and stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of spirit, vvhich are very compatible. On the solemn day of <hi>Saturday</hi> last, both this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and the Original, between the Earl of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and the Lord <hi>Weston,</hi> vvere fairly reconciled and forgiven by the King, vvith shaking of hands; and such Symbols of agreement: And likewise Sir <hi>Maurice Dromand,</hi> vvho had before upon an uncivil
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:102693:276"/>
ture on his part, between him and my Lord of <hi>Carlile,</hi> been committed to the Tower, was then delivered at the same time: and so it all ended, as a merry Fellow said, in a <hi>Maurice.</hi> But whether these be perfect cures, or but skinnings over and Palliations of Court, will appear hereafter: Nay, some say very quickly; for my Lord <hi>Westons</hi> Lady, being since brought to bed of a Daughter, men stand in a kind of suspence, whether the Queen will be the Godmother after so crude a reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which by the Kings inestimable goodness, I think may pass in this forgiving week.</p>
                     <p>For foreign matter, there is so little and so doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as it were a misery to trouble you with it. The States confuted Treaty is put to the stock; and the Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> (by account) gone to the Field two days since, having broken the business (as they say) by three demands: the resignment of <hi>Breda</hi> and <hi>Guelder,</hi> the dismantling of <hi>Rheinberge,</hi> and the equality of free exercise of Religion on either side. The States are strong in Arms, weak in Money, owing above six hundred thousand pounds <hi>sterling</hi> in bare Interest, besides the Capital. The Enemy hath neither Money, nor Men, nor Agreement. <hi>Arena sine calce;</hi> yet I hear (and <hi>ex bonis Codicibus)</hi> that the States are absolutely resolved to besiege no Town this year, unless it be some such place as may haply fall gently into their lap. They will range with divided Troops.</p>
                     <p>I will have a care in my Letters to the Kings only Sister (for that is now her published style, even in Sermons) so to commend your <hi>Frank</hi> unto her, (whom she was wont to call, when he went first over, her little Pig) that he may speedily have a Captains place.</p>

The beginning they say was upon very sleight occasion: but because a young Lady is an ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in the story, I will pass it over.

I received the Communion in St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> on <hi>Sunday</hi> last (being <hi>Easter-day)</hi> in the same Pew with your <hi>Hester</hi> and her Mother; your <hi>Hester</hi> either becomes a little tincture of the Green sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness well, or that becomes her well: well she looks, I am sure, and in my fancy draws towards the countenance of her Sister <hi>Stanhop</hi> more and more, but stealingly. My Niece <hi>Margaret</hi> is come home from her <hi>Artisan</hi> in <hi>Southwark,</hi> with some pretty amendment. The manner of his cure in those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections is somewhat strange; he useth no bindings, but oyls and stroakings; of which I take him to be (in all my reading) both the Instrument and the Author. My Niece <hi>Ann</hi> will prove one of the handsomest Creatures of the World; being much grown, and having rectified a little squint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or oblique look which she had in one of her eyes, so far as the remainder will turn to a beauty. Her Mother hath of late been much troubled (and I think as much in her fancy, which is the greater cure, as in her body) with a pain in her right side, which changeth place, and therefore is sure but a <hi>flatuous infirmity:</hi> yet it hasteneth her removing to better Air.</p>
                     <p>From my Lady, my Sister at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> we hear nothing; I believe she is in travail with her own thoughts, about desacing the inscription of the Tomb, as far as <hi>Catholica</hi> and <hi>Catholica</hi> amount unto. And I could wish, as she took your advice in the invention and word upon the Marble, she had done so in the rest: but in that you were no apt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor.</p>
                     <p>Now for foreign matters. We have fair tydings from <hi>Germany,</hi> that the Princes hold fast together, and things go well: and I am of opinion, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

when those parts have learnt as well as the lower Provinces, to spend a Summer upon the siege of a Town, the War will nestle there as well as below. For they abound in strong places; and War it self is a great refiner of spirits in little time.</p>
                     <p>The States are in the Field earlier then hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and in all judgement it importeth no less, then the countenancing and covering of a general revolt of the <hi>geheerten Provinces,</hi> as they call them: of that more in my next.

                     <p>THis other day at the Cock-pit in <hi>Shoe-lane</hi> (where my self am <hi>rara avis)</hi> your Nephew Mr. <hi>Robert Bacon</hi> came very kindely to me, with whom I was glad to refresh my acquaintance, though I had rather it had been in the Theater of <hi>Redgrave.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I asked him of his Brother, your <hi>Frank;</hi> and he told me he had been so hindered by winds, as he thought he was not yet gotten over: At which I was sorry, for he hath lost the honour of taking
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:102693:279"/>
                        <hi>Rheinberge:</hi> He may come yet timely enough to see <hi>Guelders</hi> yielded, and after that to have his share in <hi>Iuliers,</hi> which they write from the Camp, will be the next piece; and so the States will be Masters of all the tract that lies between the <hi>Maese</hi> and the <hi>Rhene,</hi> and backed with one of the fattest Provinces of Christendom. Besides, we hear they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their former footing in <hi>Brasil,</hi> and beaten the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet. It is hard to say, into what these prosperities will run out: for surely, if they can establish a right correspondency with the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Armies of <hi>Germany,</hi> and either both hold out, or neither agree without the other; even this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer will breed notable effects, and among other I hope, the restitution of the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> where, as much as the <hi>Swede</hi> had taken, is offered for 16000. Dollers; whereof the half is paid already by the Duke of <hi>Simmern,</hi> Administrator to the young <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi> in his minority, and the other moyety is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from hence. One thing I must not omit to tell you, that the said young Prince was at the siege of <hi>Rheinberge</hi> to initiate him in action. The young Cardinal <hi>Infante</hi> is come you know to <hi>Milan,</hi> and they say vvill there reside as Governour till he can recover <hi>Casale</hi> and <hi>Pignerolo,</hi> and purge <hi>Italy</hi> of the <hi>French:</hi> so as I believe he vvill come to <hi>Bruxels</hi> (for thither he finally tends) in the <hi>Spanish</hi> pace. Having thus a little skimmed over our foreign news, give me leave novv to entertain you vvith some novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Art. I send you herewith two printed Caps, a triangular Salt-celler, and the top of an Amber-Ring. The Caps is a pretty fresh invention of a very easie rate; for they vvill run shortly at some six pence apiece: and they say the sale is monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized by a Woman at <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> which may come
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:102693:279"/>
to some pretty perfection in the ornament of Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Valances of Beds, or in some fine histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Table-cloth for a Banquet, or the like. In the invention of the Salt-celler you have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest your self; for I remember (Sir) you shewed me a vvhole furniture of Marble Salt-cellers for a Table of your bespeaking: But there is one that hath only gone beyond you in the cheapness of the Material; for this vvhich you novv receive is but of Seacole, and it is strange to see vvhat a polish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so base a stuff doth take, like the ennobling of a Clown. To the broken Ring there belongs a little more discourse. I bought for a trifle in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard-street</hi> long since, because it had a Fly intombed in the sealing part; vvhich if it had been precisely in the middle, vvould have shewed like the sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Signet it self. Novv a vvhile since by a fall from a Table to the ground, it brake, though in a boarded room: vvhereupon there fell a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit into my mind, that the Ring vvas Artificial Amber, and not Natural; as indeed my Servant <hi>Giovanni</hi> and I have since plainly discovered. Novv I cannot chuse but smile vvhen I think hovv much more the first Seller of it might have had from me for the fashood (if he vvould have said so) then for the truth: For surely many rare things may be made of this composition, and intire insectiles of any greatness, and in any posture be inclosed therein; vvhich I am sure vvill inflame you, as it hath set me on fire already to find the vvay hovv to clarifie the Pasta, vvhich seems to be of Rosin, and perchance some dust of true Amber. And thus you see vvhat easie vvayes I take to please my self, vvhile I am conversing vvith you. Let me add to these, a strange thing to be seen in <hi>London</hi> for a
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:102693:280"/>
couple of pence, vvhich I knovv not vvhether I should call a piece of Art, or Nature: It is an <hi>English man</hi> like some Swabber of a Ship come from the <hi>Indies,</hi> vvhere he hath learned to eat Fire as familiarly as ever I savv any eat Cakes, even whole glowing Brands, vvhich he vvill crash vvith his teeth, and swallovv. I believe he hath been hard famished in the <hi>Terra de Fuego,</hi> on the South of the <hi>Magellan strait.</hi>

                     <p>Sir, I have heard (I knovv not by vvhom) that you had a purpose to be here this <hi>Whitsontide;</hi> but imagining that at least Mr. <hi>Chitock</hi> may meet you by the vvay, I have ventured the trouble of these lines unto you. For mine own estate, I must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you, (because vvhether vvell or ill, I am yours) that of late I have been much troubled vvith certain splenetick vapours, mounting to the top of my Stomach vvhen it is empty: For vvhich I am in a course of gentle Physick at the present, remembring that of <hi>Galen.

vvhen I cannot flie thither to have my vvonted part of that conversation, vvherein all that knovv him enjoy such infinite contentment? Thus much did suddenly break loose from the heart that doth truly honour you. And novv (Sir) let me tell you both hovv it hath gone vvith me, and hovv I stand at the present. There is a triple health: health of Body, of Mind, and of Fortune; you shall have a short account of all three.</p>
                     <p>For the first; it is novv almost an vvhole Cycle of the Sun, since after certain fits of a Quotidian Feaver, I vvas assailed by that Splenetick Passion, vvhich a Countrey good Fellovv that had been a piece of a Grammarian meant, vvhen he said he vvas sick of the <hi>Flatus,</hi> and the other hard word; for <hi>Hypocondriacus</hi> stuck in his Teeth: It is the very <hi>Proteus</hi> of all Maladies; shifting into sundry shapes, almost every night a nevv, and yet still the same; neither can I hope, that it will end in a solar Period, being such a Saturnine Humour; but though the Core and Root of it be remaining, yet the Symptomes (I thank my God) are vvell allayed: And in general, I have found it of more contumacy then malignity; only since the late cold vveather, there is complicated vvith it a more Asthmatical straitness of respiration then heretofore: yet those about me say, I bear it vvell, as perchance custome hath taught me; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing novv familiarized and domesticated evils: In the Tragedians expression, <hi>Iam mansueta Mala.</hi> And thus much of the habit of my Body. On the other side, my Mind is in a right Philosophical Estate of health; that is, at an equal distance both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="468" facs="tcp:102693:281"/>
yet I have some imployment or my thoughts to keep them from mouldring, as you shall know before I close this Letter. But first, touching the third kind of health. My condition or fortune was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver better, then in this good Lord Treasurers time: the very reverse of his proud Predecessor, that made a scorn of my poverty, and a sport of my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty; leaving me in bad case; and the world so, as though we now know by what Arts he lived, yet are we ignorant to this hour by what Religion he died, save only that it could not be good, which was not worthy the professing. This free passage let me commit to your noble brest, remembring that in confidence of the receiver, I have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed a late Counsel of mine own which I gave to a young friend, who asking me casually of what he should make him a sute, as he was passing this way towards <hi>London;</hi> I told him that in my opinion, he could not buy a cheaper nor a more lasting stuff there then <hi>silence.</hi> For I loved him well, and was afraid of a little freedome that I spied in him. And now, Sir, I must needs conclude (or I shall burst) with letting you know, that I have divers things in wilde sheets that think and struggle to get out of several kinds, some long promised, and some of a newer conception: but a poor exercise of my Pen (wherewith I shall only honour my self by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication thereof unto your own person) is that which shall lead the way by mine and your good leave, intending (if God yield me his favour) to Print it before it be long in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and to send you thence, or bring you a Copy to our <hi>Redgrave.</hi> What the subject is you must not know before hand: for I fear it will want all other grace, if it lose vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity. And so the Lord of all abundant joy keep

The rest of his stay, was only that I might collect among my poor memorials and experiments some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conducible to the recovery of your health, wherein I reckon my self as much interessed as in any one thing of this world. I will not say unto you, <hi>Courage,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> use to speak: for you have enough of that within your self: Nor, <hi>Be merry,</hi> in our <hi>English</hi> phrase (for you can impart enough of that even to others in the incomparable delight of your conversation) But let me give you two comforts, though needless to the serenity of your spirits. The first, That I hope your infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will not hold you long, because it comes (as I may speak, according to the barbarous Translators of <hi>Avicenna) In complexionato suo:</hi> that is in the very season of the revolution of melancholick humours, for <hi>Omnis Morbus contra complexionatum Patientis vel Temporis, est periculosus aut longus.</hi> The other, That it hath not succeeded any precedent caustick disease, because those Quartans are of all the most obstinate which arise out of the Incineration of a former Ague. The rest I have committed to the

And first, I send you your immortal Uncles Confession of his Faith, which I did promise you at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> solidly and excellently couched, as whatsoever else had the happiness to fall under his Meditation and Pen.
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:102693:283"/>
Next; you receive a Letter freshly written me from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> with mention (God bless us) of a Jesuite of your name: who seems (as all that comes from any of you is piercing) to have sent over lately some pretty insinuative Book in matter of Theological Controversie, perchance better dressed then any before, and with more relish com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the vulgar taste, but I believe it will be the same to the stomack: for well they may change their form, but it is long since we have heard their substance over and over, still the same <hi>ad fastidium usque.</hi> I shall languish to know how he toucheth upon your Name and stirp. The Name of my friend who writ me the said Letter, I have defaced for the censure of some other things therein, which I should be sorry to adventure at large: but you shall know him from me hereafter; and believe it, he will be worth your knowing.</p>
                     <p>I cannot forbear to tell you a thing (I know not whether I should call it news, because it is nearer you then to us) but strange in truth, written me from the said University at the same time by the Provost of Kings Colledge there; between whom and me doth pass much familiar correspondency. It is of a weekly Lecture there performed hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore by the Person of Mr. <hi>Christopher Goad,</hi> and lately deposed with severe commandment (as it should seem) from above, whereupon the Women especially by way of revenge for that restraint do flock to St. <hi>Maries</hi> in such troops, and so early, that the Masters of Art have no room to sit; so as the Vice-Chancellor and Heads of Houses were in deliberation to repress their shoaling thither. Methinks, it is a good thing, when zeal in a land grows so thick and so warm. But soft, if I lanch
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:102693:283"/>
any farther, I may perchance run (which yet were a great mistake) into the name of a Puritan. For that very Lecturer which is now deposed, did live heretofore with me at my Table upon especial choice: being in truth a man of sweet conversation, and of sober solidity.</p>
                     <p>Now, for other things, <hi>Nicolas Oudard</hi> brought me the <hi>Friday</hi> after his departure from you the glad tidings of your Agues discharge, as you then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it would be at the twentieth Access, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (as you seem to have told him) to a common observation with you there: so as in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> I see you count Quartan fits, as you do your Sheep, by the score. I could heartily wish you would take for some time after it <hi>Alternis Diebus,</hi> my prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Lignum Sanctum,</hi> with addition likewise of the roots of <hi>China, Enula Campana,</hi> and a sprig of <hi>Tamarisque,</hi> all in the decoction of Barley-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and quickned with a little sprinkling of a Lemmon: a rare Receipt to corroborate the Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera, and to keep the Stomack in <hi>Tono.</hi> My said <hi>Nicolas</hi> tells me likewise, that you began to chirp upon being in <hi>London</hi> the next Term. I should be glad with your favour to know that point precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for having a purpose (by Gods dear blessing) to visit you at <hi>Redgrave</hi> (which will be the best Cordial I took in long time) I would shape my course circularly, either from <hi>Suffolk</hi> to <hi>Kent,</hi> or from <hi>Kent</hi> to <hi>Suffolk,</hi> as I shall hear of your moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards the beginning of next Lent. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties of Court and State, all mens minds at the present with us seem magnetical, looking towards the North. Order is come down this day to the Justices of this Shire, about a general muster at <hi>Alisbury</hi> the next week, and for especial watch at

the Beacons; so as any burning of a bush by chance near one of them, would set the whole Province in an alarm; but notwithstanding these good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, we hope well of the issue; and the rather, for that a pretty strong conceit runneth, that the Deanary of <hi>Durham</hi> is reserved for Doctor <hi>Belkan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel,</hi> as a reward of his travels to and fro in this great business. While we are uniting our ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious breaches, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> abroad treat hard this Winter about a peace, as one writeth, (and I believe very truly) without consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of any other Prince or State but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. If this be so, and take effect in that manner, then is <hi>Charles de Loraine Exutus Lepidus</hi> stript to his shirt, the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> left at large, and the <hi>Swede</hi> must stand upon his own feet. But <hi>Brevibus Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis summa vertuntur:</hi> all depends upon the taking, or not taking of <hi>Brisach,</hi> the <hi>Helena</hi> of <hi>Germany:</hi> and though a Town indeed of great strength and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, yet a poor price for so much blood as hath been lost about it. While I am talking of War, let me tell you what I hear, that your Sir <hi>Jacob Ashley</hi> is grown a great man at Court in private intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements to the King, together with the Earl <hi>Marshal:</hi> our good Sovereign will feel a sufficient man quickly. The States lie still and close oppressed with the adversities of the last year; and with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, then the late ruine of forty well laden Ships by the <hi>Texel,</hi> wherein with deploration of the whole Province were lost one thousand Mariners.</p>
                     <p>Touching the subject whereof I sent you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count by <hi>Nicolas,</hi> I have heard nothing since to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease my hope, and much less my faith. You shall have more the next week. Till when and ever our sweet Jesus have you in his love.</p>

                     <p>Let me therefore by this opportunity entertain you with some of our newest things; but briefly, for I dare not trust my brains too much.</p>
                     <p>First, for the affairs of <hi>Scotland: Est bene non potuit dicere, dixit, Erit.</hi> The wisest Physitians of State are of opinion that the <hi>Crisis</hi> is good; and I hope your Sir <hi>Iacob Ashley,</hi> and my Sir <hi>Thomas Morton,</hi> will have a fine employment upon the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; Honour by the choice of their persons, money by their journal pay, little pains, and no danger. Our Court mourneth this whole Festival with sad frugality for the untimely death of the young Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> our Queens Nephew, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened they say by the Cardinal his Uncle, who would first have illegitimated him, and that not taking effect by the supportment of <hi>Spain,</hi> he fell to other Roman Arts; so as the said Cardinal to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline this black report, is gone a wandring; and as it is thought, will visit bare-foot the Holy Land. In the mean time, methinks I see him with a crew of <hi>Banditi</hi> and <hi>Bravi</hi> in his company, and his own Conscience a continual Hangman about him. The Queen Mother stirreth little between Majesty and Age: She hath published a short <hi>Manifesto,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reasons of her recess from <hi>Bruxels,</hi> wherein is one very notable conceit: <hi>That she had long born silently the affronts done her by the Prince, Cardinals, Counsellors, and under-Officers, upon no other reason, then the very shame to have received them.</hi> Of himself she speaketh with good respect, but I know not how the Character of Humility (which she giveth him)

There is newly sworn her Servant, a lovely Daughter of Sir <hi>Richard Harisons,</hi> our Neighbour in <hi>Barkshire,</hi> to answer <hi>Madamoiselle Darci</hi> on her Mothers side. The Count <hi>Palatine</hi> since his late defeat, is gotten in disguised habit to <hi>Hamborough,</hi> and as they say, hath been there visited by the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> amidst that cold Assembly of Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors: But in his passage between the said Town and <hi>Bremen,</hi> was like to have been taken by an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush of Free-booters, who no doubt would have made sale of him. Certain it is, that his Brother Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> sought very nobly before he yielded; whereof such notice was taken, even by the Count of <hi>Hatfield</hi> himself, that he hath ever since been kept by him in a strong place, rounded, day and night with a guard of naked Swords; yet in the Tablets of one that had leave to visit him, the Prince made a shift to comfort the Queen his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a line or two to this sence: <hi>That whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever became of himself, he would never change his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, nor his Party.</hi> We hear my Lord <hi>Craven</hi> hath made his composition under 20000. <hi>l.</hi> As for <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> I believe his own head must ransome him, or his heels. The Popes Treaty at <hi>Colen</hi> goes <hi>Il passe del Gambaro,</hi> rather backward then forward. And all deliberatives of State seem to depend much upon the event of <hi>Brisach,</hi> which I use to call the <hi>German Helena,</hi> long woed, but for ought I hear yet, an Imperial Virgin.

                     <p>MY humble suit unto your Lordship is this: It is His Majesties usual Grace, to yield His forraign Servants the comfort of His Gracious sight once in three years, as this Republick doth likewise recall their Ministers, vvhich Term by my Privy Seal vvill end on the first of <hi>February</hi> next.</p>
                     <p>I do therefore humbly beg, that by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships intercession, I may have leave to return home for a moneth or six vveeks, concurring two ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occasions.</p>
                     <p>The one, for the pursuit of a business depending on a Patent long since granted to Sir <hi>Edward Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mock</hi> and me, vvhereunto I am summoned by His Majesties Attorney, as vvill appear unto your Lordship by the Copy of the said Attorneys Letter, (coming herewith) vvritten to my Brother Sir <hi>Iames Wotton,</hi> my Feoffee in trust; vvherein my presence is necessary, by reason of some differences between the said Sir <hi>Edward Dymock</hi> and me. And this is a Case vvherein vve are to maintain His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Title, as hath been endeavoured, vvith our own moneys hitherto unfruitfully spent.</p>
                     <p>The other, for the re-ordering of my Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, vvhich have been much incommodated by the failing of <hi>Seignor Burlamachie</hi>'s credit here, (though it stand vvell in other places) by a trick that vvas played him.</p>

                     <p>I Came to <hi>Munichen,</hi> the Court of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> in the evening before the Feast of <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> and in my company, the Duke <hi>Ioachimus Ernestus</hi> of <hi>Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Here vve thought only to have stolen a sight, in some private vvindow, of the Procession the next day, vvhere vve vvere told the Princes and vvhole
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:102693:290"/>
Court vvould be: But in the morning vve vvere prevented by the Duke <hi>Maximilian,</hi> vvho having gotten knowledge of our qualities, sent a Baron of his Bed-Chamber vvith Coaches to conduct us to the Court; vvhich gracious surprisal vve could not civilly resist. At the Court vve vvere placed, by the Dukes own appointment, in a Gallery; where when we saw a more solemn and sober Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, then I had beheld even at <hi>Rome,</hi> under the Popes eyes; as perhaps, all superstition is loosest at the fountain. In this Procession, a little after the Duke and his Brother <hi>Albertus,</hi> went two young Sons of one of them, that were thrown out of the window at <hi>Prage,</hi> who since then have been fostered in <hi>Bavaria:</hi> And from hence we took our first judgement of the affections of that Court. I cannot omit, that at this Solemnity were two <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites;</hi> who otherwise in <hi>Italy</hi> do studiously decline the familiarity of such publick appearances, for preservation of respect: At which when I did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press some wonder, I was told between jest and earnest, that indeed the greater Fathers were more reserved of their presence; but these were only like Ushers over the Seminary Boyes, to keep them in awe at this Shew.</p>
                     <p>This done, the Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi> and my self were led and lodged in several Quarters of the Palace: and before Dinner, the Duke <hi>Maximilian</hi> (though tyred with walking) sent singly for me, and passed with me more then an hour in private and free dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: Falling into it, with as serious protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as mine ears ever heard, that though he was bred in the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith, yet no Prince living did more honour and reverence the great vertues, and eminent wisdome of the King my Master, to whom
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:102693:291"/>
he had the honour to be allied, both by marriage, and by his own descent; and therefore should have thought it a disgrace for him, to let me go that way, without offering me, after I had passed the <hi>Alpes,</hi> a little commodity of repose in that poor House, as he was pleased to term it; being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise one of the most capable, magnificent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Fabricks of Christendome; and all of his own device and erection in five years. He told me besides, how sensible he was of the honour which the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> had done him with a personal surprisal; and how ashamed, that the times had not yet permitted him to revenge that favour, which he had vowed to do with the first opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And the rather, that he might invite Your Majesties most vertuous Daughter (who hath filled these Countreys with her excellent fame) to come and take possession in <hi>Bavaria</hi> of her Woods and Fields, and to kill all there that had either wings or feet. This was the Complemental part of his Speech. In the rest, he bewailed the present ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of unquietness in the Empire: He la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented likewise the situation of his own State, which made it hard for him to preserve himself neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral, though he had studied it. He spake of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando</hi>'s person, kindly; of his fortune, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> with a cool temper; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther censuring the form of their proceeding, then the cause: of himself, with singular moderation, and without the least discovery of any ambitious affections, though we found his Courtiers warm enough in their hopes.</p>
                     <p>After Dinner, he sent for the Duke of <hi>Holstein:</hi> And then came himself with his whole train to visit me on that side where I was placed, (an honour
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:102693:291"/>
done seldome before<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>, as I heard, to any Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor) where he spent with me about half an hour, with new affirmations of his reverent respect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Your Majesty: As likewise, the morning following; when with much ado, we got leave to be gone. Which noble language he afterwards (as not contented with a verbal profession) did prosecute in a Letter that I received from him on the way, which I reserve to be shewn Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.</p>
                     <p>This was my entertainment in the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Court, by a Prince (I am bound to say) every way good, but in that wherein he should be best: of noble manner in his hospitality; of sharp con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, of great erudition; and both orderly and lovingly served. Which Circumstances I have thought it my part to set down the more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that, I am certainly informed of much jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie both taken and expressed by the Pope, at the Count <hi>Palatine</hi>'s reception in that Court; and more, for a Book written by his Chancellor, and published by the Dukes direct Command, (prefixed in the front thereof) in defence of <hi>Ludovicus,</hi> the <hi>Bavarian</hi> excommunicated Emperor: Which things considered, make his kindness to Your Majesties Servant, and professions towards Your Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, more notable. Now to proceed:</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Augusta</hi> I took language, that the Princes and States of the Union had deferred their Assembly ten dayes: which gave me opportunity to find them together at <hi>Heilbrun,</hi> whom I should have missed at their own homes. And for due respect, I gave the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> notice of my intent to be there, by a Gentleman expresly sent. Of what I did in <hi>Augusta</hi> for Your Majesties service, I bring
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:102693:292"/>
with me the Accompt. Being arrived at <hi>Heilbrun,</hi> the day after the first sitting of the Princes, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired immediately to the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, not only of the Union; but likewise of me; (for so I told him was Your Majesties. Will:) who after he had spoken with his Associates, did order the form of my proceeding in this manner: With himself, I was to treat <hi>in Individuo,</hi> both for respect of privacy, being Your Majesties Son-in-Law, and of Dignity, being then <hi>Provisor</hi> of the Empire, as his right style is, and not <hi>Vicar.</hi> To the four Princes, I went joyntly; they agreeing upon a room where they would assemble, and sending for me their Coaches and Courtiers; namely, the Marquess of <hi>Anspach,</hi> (who hath the precedency, as an Electoral branch) the Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> the Marquess of <hi>Baden,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Christianus</hi> of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> respondent for his own House: The Landgrave <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Hassia</hi> was not there, but voiced to be sick. The Marquess of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> was out of the Empire in <hi>Prussia,</hi> and his Son in the Low Provinces. The Representants of the three United Cities, <hi>Nurenburg, Strasburg,</hi> and <hi>Ulm,</hi> (which direct the meaner Towns) were to come all joyntly (as they did) to my Lodging. The Count <hi>Palatine</hi> met me at the Stair-head; and did render me the visitation, where I lay, in person: The Princes came all joyntly down into the very Street, to take me from my Coach; and in like manner brought me down again unto it; and did afterwards visit me all together: The Marquess of <hi>Anspach</hi> then presenting unto me their Answer in writing, with all due commemoration of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to Your Majesty. The Representants of the Cities did present their Answer verbally at my
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:102693:292"/>
Lodging by the <hi>Syndic</hi> of <hi>Strasburg,</hi> with no less zeal and devotion then the Princes had done. And this was the formal part, full of all just respect that could be expressed in that place. Now touching the real part: When I had conferred with the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> your Majesties scope in the main business, I found him in truth for himself exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward; but for the other Princes and Towns he objected two difficulties: The one was, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent distractions of <hi>Germany,</hi> which made the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position somewhat unseasonable. The other vvas, the differences between our Church and those of the <hi>Augustine</hi> Confession; vvhich though but few, yet perchance might a little hinder their concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with us in this excellent work: especially the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Princes, being likely to do nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out counsel of their Ministers, and they being the passionatest Men amongst them. These two obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions considered, it was thought fit by the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> (into whose hands I had delivered my self) after deliberation vvith his own Counsellors, that I should at this time only dispose the other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Representants of Cities, in your Majesties Name, towards a concurrence, with apt lenitives and probabilities; and that I should endeavor, by your Majesties Christian perswasion, to remove all asperity that might impeach it, leaving a more particular prosecution thereof till the noise of the Empire were settled: in which mean while, many things might be further thought on to advance this purpose, and be conferred afterwards by Letters.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon I framed my Speech to the Princes in the manner following.</p>
                     <p>I told them, that I brought thither two sorts of Commissions, The one from the Duke and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:102693:293"/>
of <hi>Venice, sub fide tacita,</hi> which I presented in writing, containing a profession of much good will from that State towards them, and a clear incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to a streighter correspondence with them: In contemplation of whom, the Republick had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved not to permit the transport of any succours cross their Gulf into <hi>Austria,</hi> for the further troubling of <hi>Germany.</hi> This vvas the substance of that I brought under silent confidence, without any other credit then mine own honesty might bear; vvhich had been delivered unto me by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Senate, whom I acquainted thus far, that I vvould take home-wards the vvay of <hi>Germany.</hi> Wherein I craved from the Princes and the rest some taste of their inclinations, that these fair offers might be farther prosecuted by your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties mediation, vvhom I knevv much to desire the further strengthning of this Body with good A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
                     <p>My other Commission vvas (as I said) from mine own Royal Master, from vvhom I brought Letters of his confidence unto them; after presentation vvhereof, and all other due premises, I told them,</p>
                     <p>That your Majesty having long and deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered the corruptions that have grown in your own Kingdoms, and in the States of your Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates and Friends, by the secret practices of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits,</hi> did finally observe but one only cause of this creeping mischief, and but one onely remedy; vvhich you had thought meet to communicate with them by an express though a covered Legation, under the colour of my return homewards. The cause of the said evils vvas, that vve had left the Pope at too much ease in his own Provinces; the remedy would be, to cut him out so much work
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:102693:293"/>
at home, as should force him to gather his thoughts about himself, and in conclusion to revoke his Emissaries for the maintaining of <hi>Italy.</hi> To do this, there vvere but four means:</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. By the advantage of Arms in time of Action.</item>
                        <item>2. By open Preaching.</item>
                        <item>3. By dispersion of Books.</item>
                        <item>4. By secret Semination.</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>For the first, it vvas true, that the late necessity of calling <hi>French<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> (among vvhom there vvere many of our Religion) into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch, Flemish,</hi> and <hi>English</hi> into <hi>Friuli,</hi> had done some good by freedom of conversation, all Inquisition ceasing at such times: But this violent vvay must be left to further occasion.</p>
                     <p>For the second, although there had been for one vvhole Lent publick preaching against the <hi>Roman</hi> doctrine in <hi>Venice;</hi> yet that Liberty and the Popes Excommunication did cease together, and must so abide till nevv opportunity.</p>
                     <p>For the third, I acquainted them hovv greedy the <hi>Italians</hi> vvere of our Treatises in matter of Controversie, and of divers ways that had been used both to excite, and to satisfie that curiosity, both by the vvorks of the Arch bishop of <hi>Spalato,</hi> since his retirement into your Majesties protection; and of a Discourse that vvas ready to come abroad, vvherein should be discovered by a great intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent man, even of their own breeding, all the Practices of the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> out of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Registers and secret Papers; vvherein your Majesty had a hand, for the benefit of the Christian World.</p>
                     <p>For the fourth and last vvay, of secret Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vvherein vve had been hitherto vvholly defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:102693:294"/>
and asleep: This I said vvas the particular scope of my present charge.</p>
                     <p>In this your Majesty did exhort them by all fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent perswasion to joyn vvith you their counsels and cares, their diligence and powers, according to such vvays as should be hereafter propounded either by your Majesty to them, or conceived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves. Whereunto your Majesty had been stirred, first by the zeal of Gods glory; next, by a Religious shame and indignation, to see Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition more active then the Truth: Thirdly, by the instance of divers well-affected Persons, both vvithin the Body of <hi>Italy,</hi> and in the Confines thereof. And lastly, by the opportunity vvhich the present time it self did yield unto it: vvhich I did particularly remonstrate unto them; but being matter of secrecy, I vvill keep it in my pen till I arrive vvith your Majesty.</p>
                     <p>After vvhich, I concluded vvith your Majesties most loving and Christian perswasions unto them (vvhich they could not refuse, coming from such a Friend) to lay aside our own small differences, to suppress the heat of passionate Divines by Civil Authority, and to joyn together against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Adversary of our Churches and States.</p>
                     <p>And because the free passage into <hi>Italy</hi> vvas a point much importing the present purpose, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in other respects very considerable, your Majesty did intreat them to spend their earnest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession by a common Letter to the Cantons of <hi>Zurick</hi> and <hi>Bern,</hi> That they vvould endeavor by all means possible (as being incomparably the fittest Mediators) to re-establish the League between the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the <hi>Grisons;</hi> to vvhich both parties vvere vvell inclining, but there vvanted a third
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:102693:294"/>
to break the business, and to remove the scruple of who shall begin, which had hitherto hindred the effect.</p>
                     <p>This was my poor exposition of Your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: whereof I thought it my duty to render Your Majesty this preambulatory Accompt, for Your ease at mine arrival, and for mine own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge: bringing with me, the Letters and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers of the Princes, as I hope, to Your Majesties full contentment.</p>
                     <p>I will conclude with my most humble thanks unto Your Royal Goodness, for this Imployment above all other: And with my prayers to God, that the weakness of the Instrument, may not prejudice the excellent intention of the Master and Director.</p>

<pb n="499" facs="tcp:102693:296"/>
During vvhich time of my stay, the Emperour sent me, some Provisions, and vvithal the young Baron of <hi>Harach</hi> to conduct me hither, and here continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to assist me, for procurement of my Audiences, or any other conveniences, being a Gentleman of the Emperours Bed-chamber, twice heretofore em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in foreign Ambassages, Son-in-lavv to the Count <hi>Eckemberg,</hi> the Emperors Favorite, and Son to the next of his Counsellors in grace and credit; though the young Baron of <hi>Mersberg,</hi> Captain of his Guard, vvas sent to the <hi>French,</hi> yet I perceive in the choice of this other Gentleman, an equality of respect towards your Majesty vvas used.</p>
                     <p>An hour after my arrival here, he sent to bid me vvelcome the Count of <hi>Mecaw,</hi> heretofore Lord Chamberlaine to the Emperour <hi>Matthias,</hi> and a Counsellor to this, <hi>in tertiis quartisve.</hi> I am placed near to the Court, in the House of the Baron <hi>de Gabriana,</hi> vvith rich furniture and good attendance, and hitherto at the Emperors charge, vvhich vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a vvhile must cease, of vvhich I have given the Reason in my Letter to Mr. Secretary <hi>Nanton.</hi> In the mean time I must profess unto your Majesty, that no circumstance of due regard to the Honour of your Name hath been here omitted, but all done vvith unexpected freedom; in so much as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me at my Table, are sent and admitted Gentlemen of both Religions, and of the best de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, vvhich in the meaner Courts of <hi>Germany</hi> I have noted to pass vvith more restraint. Thus much concerning my Reception, vvhich is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal part.</p>
                     <p>Novv before I pass unto the material, it is a piece of curiosity to tell unto your Majesty, vvhat discords I here finde amongst the publick Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:102693:297"/>
vvhich seem somewhat considerable: The <hi>French</hi> Ambassadours have been here about seven vveeks, and to this hour are unvisited by the <hi>Spanish</hi> (though close adjoyning them) upon a meagre punctuality; for thus it standeth, The <hi>French</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived on the <hi>Munday</hi> at night; the <hi>Spaniard</hi> sent immediately to vvelcome them his Secretary, <hi>ex forma.</hi> They have Audience the next morning fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: that passed, the Count <hi>Ognate</hi> demands leave to visit them in the afternoon; they desire to be excused, being a day of ordinary dispatch. The excuse is accepted; but because they did not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards, vvithout a second demand, send him vvord that they vvould be at leisure, <hi>incrassatus est sanguis,</hi> on the <hi>Spanish</hi> side. A much deeper and incurable case is fallen out betwixt the <hi>French</hi> and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Ambassador of <hi>Parma,</hi> vvho, after the <hi>French</hi> sent first unto him, as they say, (though he affirms it vvas the <hi>Spaniard)</hi> did yet visit the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> before them belike, according to the method of his devotion, and proximity to his Master, or of Authority in this Court: howsoever, hereupon the Duke of <hi>Angolesme</hi> assigned the same Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour a day to visit him, and vvhen he came <hi>alla buona,</hi> he shut his Gates upon him: Which is here generally the worse interpreted, because he is a Bishop, seeming an affront to both his qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In such a touchy time as this, I had almost had my share; to whom, after the three <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors had sent their three Secretaries (for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the <hi>Spaniard)</hi> as far as <hi>Cloyster Newburg,</hi> vvhere I made my stop: they vvere likewise the first here that sent to visit me, but came all three together, and vvith them Monsieur <hi>de Beaugie</hi> the Ordinary Agent: Whereupon fell a little dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:102693:297"/>
between us, Whether visits of respect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Representants of equality, being received <hi>in specie,</hi> should be paid <hi>in individuo?</hi> vvhich seemed unto me no good complemental <hi>Logick:</hi> but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards, first, that their Commissions vvere the same; then, that the Emperor had sent to their several Lodgings; and the Popes <hi>Nuncio,</hi> though visited in gross, had visited them apart, I made an end of this scruple: yet not before a promise, that if your Majesty should send more Ambassadors hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they vvill proceed <hi>a la pareille</hi> vvith them: having gained thus much by this small debate, that perchance they think me not over-punctual, nor altogether supine. I have likewise received and rendered to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador all due forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and from all other Ambassadors and Agents, except the Popes, and the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s, vvhose habits make us incommiscible. Of the rest I need not speak at all; of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> I vvill presume to speak my opinion, as far as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the main. I find the <hi>French</hi> surely of good intention towards a peace here, but not hasty ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to believe in truth that the Crowns of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia</hi> or <hi>Bohemia</hi> vvere Hereditary. Here, at their first coming, they had more credit (as I receive from a good hand) then they seem to have novv; vvhich is thought to proceed from the <hi>Spanish</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, vvho in this Court is not only the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Counsellor, but hath in truth a <hi>Dictatoriam potestatem,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> find; the reason being not very obscure: for vvhen I put in the <hi>major,</hi> that the Emperors resolutions depend upon necessities; and in the <hi>minor,</hi> that his necessities depend upon <hi>Spain,</hi> I think I may spare the conclusion. Thus stand the publick Ministers here, and thus they
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:102693:298"/>
stand one vvith another; vvhich I thought fit to set down, because it hath some influence into the general business.</p>
                     <p>Novv to proceed to the scope of my employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in matter of substance. I had Audience of the Emperor (as the <hi>French)</hi> the second day after my arrival, vvhere vvhat I said, vvill best appear to your Majesty out of the Memorial, vvhich I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards [sent] unto him, at his own requisition, here following vvord for vvord, as I have translated it out of the <hi>Italian,</hi> in vvhich language the Emperor treateth most vvillingly.</p>

                  <div type="letter">
                     <head>The Proposition of <hi>Henry Wotton</hi> Knight, Ambassador Extraordinary from his Majesty of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> delivered in the Name of his Sovereign-Lord the King with all real intention to his Sacred Imperial Majesty, the 23 of <hi>August, stylo vet.</hi> did contain four points.</head>
                     <p>FIrst, That his Imperial Majesty would be pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make known his inclination towards a sincere Treaty upon the present Motions.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That it will please him by one or two, or more, to inform the said Ambassador of all the fundamental Arguments in the merit of the Cause, which shall be most faithfully represented by him to the King his Master.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Either his Imperial Majesty vvill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, or agree to enter into Treaty: In the first case, It vvere vain for Representants of Princes of good intentions, to spend further the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Masters. In the second, His Majesty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> doth think it most convenient, that both the Parties, together with their Confederates,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:102693:298"/>
be contented to condescend to a cessation of Arms for some competent time; lest vvhile their Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilements vvere in Treaty, their passions be more exasperated then before.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That for the furthering of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement, His Imperial Majesty would be pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to free the passages of Curriers from <hi>Vienna</hi> to <hi>Prague;</hi> vvhich shall be procured likewise on the other side.</p>
                     <p>Besides these substantial points, the said Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador did touch three Considerations about the Person of His Soveraign Lord the King, which did render Him with His Imperial Majesty of indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble credit, although interessed by so strait Bonds in the contrary side.</p>
                     <p>First, His Majesties clearness in the beginning of these Motions:</p>
                     <p>Secondly, His Neutrality in the progress thereof:</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, His Equity in the present.</p>
                     <p>Touching the first point, the Ambassador decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in His Majesties Name, with high and holy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations, that He had had in Election of His Son-in-Law to the Crown of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> no partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Counsel, or fore-knowledge. VVhich His Majesty did not only affirm for Himself; but as indubitably in the Person of His Son-in Law, that he had no way fore-practised that Election.</p>
                     <p>For the second point, of Neutrality, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador said, that His Majesty had not yet given the Title of <hi>King</hi> to His Son-in-Law, or of <hi>Queen</hi> to His Daughter, in any Letter either publick or private; nor had permitted the same Title, in any Sermons, within His Kingdomes.</p>
                     <p>As for the third point, of Equity, the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:102693:299"/>
shewed most evidently, the great moderation and aequanimity of the King his Master, in not having setled any firm judgement touching the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Cause, upon information from that side vvherein His Majesty is most interessed, vvithout first requiring farther knowledge from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror himself by an express Minister.</p>
                     <p>This vvas the Memorial of my Proposition.</p>
                     <p>Four days after, the Emperor sends me vvord, that his Answer vvas ready; giving me my choice, vvhether I vvould receive it from himself, or else from the Baron of <hi>Eckemberg</hi> his Principal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor; and, vvhether verbally, or in vvriting, or both. In this gracious option, I took hold of the vvriting, because <hi>scripta manent:</hi> and vvished I might have it from the Baron, vvithout the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors farther trouble, till from it might rise some nevv occasion. To the Baron I vvas called two days after; vvhom I found infirmer of his feet then of his head; for in truth he is a Gentleman of strong conceit, and fair delivery, though (as most of the Court are) tainted vvith the <hi>Iesuit.</hi> From him I received (besides complements, and many thanks, for the honour that your Majesty had done his Master; and vehement protestation of intire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in your Christian intentions at the present, and of your former clearness) the Paper that cometh herewith, indorsed, <hi>Contenta Resolutionis Caesareae data Nobilissimo Legato serenissimi Regis Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae Brittanniae.</hi> In delivery whereof, the Baron seeming much to insist upon the persons [to] whom the Emperour had formerly been content to commit the business: as first, to the four Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, whereof the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> himself was one; then to the whole Electoral Colledge, even after
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:102693:299"/>
sufficient offence to distast him from the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> who would have hindred his Election at <hi>Francfort;</hi> I say, by these recapitulations perchance silently inferring, that the <hi>German</hi> Princes were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perest Intervenients: I was moved to tell him, that I knew, Your Majesty in this case was more ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the good, then of the glory; and if Your worthier Servants at <hi>Prague,</hi> and I here, co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating with the <hi>French,</hi> could prepare the matter, is it were <hi>in Chylo,</hi> for a fuller concoction hereafter by more hands, we should think our selves very happy: With which reply he seemed extreamly pleased.</p>
                     <p>To the third point, about a Cessation, he spake somewhat more gloriously, then we here see cause; that things were now too far run on, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours preparations being made, and his friends in motion: wherein he gave a touch (though more, I think, then he could then say) upon <hi>Saxony:</hi> he added likewise, that no doubt the Count <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> was as forward with his powers, and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, naming <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> and perchance, said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>e, by his means the <hi>Turk</hi> I replied (as I had done before to the Emperour himself) that the event of Arms was uncertain; and pittyfull to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, what desperation might breed: But in the mean time, I had heard wise men of opinion, that the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> had done the Emperour no d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure in accepting the Crown of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> laid upon him by those, which peradventure, might otherwise have placed it on a worse neighbour to these Provinces. To which truth the Emperour (when I said it) nor himself replied any thing: and upon my conscience, so they think.</p>
                     <p>To the last, about freeing the Passage, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:102693:300"/>
me too largely, as if I had meant the re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of a Current Post, which round about this place is every where broken: but he hath granted his safe Conduct, upon occasion, as far as he is able; though <hi>ea conditione,</hi> as Your Majesty sees in his written Answer, <hi>ut non alias, quam dicti Domini Legati literas deferant.</hi> The only point of jealousie that I have met with since my coming.</p>
                     <p>To the second, which I make the last, because I have most to say upon it, he told me, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour would send to my Lodging some Persons of dignity, and knowledge, to inform me in that Cause. As he did, the day after: namely, the Baron <hi>Pople,</hi> Great Chancellour of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Baron of <hi>Straulendorf,</hi> Chief President of the Auli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Counsel, <hi>Der Here Mostitz, Consiliarius Aulicus;</hi> the first a <hi>Bohemian,</hi> the other two <hi>Germans:</hi> of whose persons I shall afterwards inform Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty. But to proceed: The Errand, delivered by the Great Chancellour, consisted for the most part of things I knew were often published already, which I shall the less care for to repeat, because Your Majesty received lately the substance thereof, under the title of,—<hi>ex Constitutionibus. &amp; Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiis,</hi> &amp;c. consigned to me by the said Deputies; and likewise the same again more clearly set down and more fully expressed by a new Author, as yet unknown, a Book the Emperour himself sent me, the day after this Conference, to be conveyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Your Majesty. Two things they urged with much vehemency: [First,] certain Letters, both from the <hi>Bohemian</hi> [Directors.] and which is more, from all the States of <hi>Hungary,</hi> with pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Seals; wherein they call this Emperour <hi>[King]</hi> fifteen moneths after they had chosen
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:102693:300"/>
him, and yet the Chancellor having spoken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in all that time, they afterwards pretended that the Election was null. They shewed likewise an Original Letter from the Count <hi>Palatine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, dated at <hi>Hidelberg April</hi> 23. 1619. <hi>tempore Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariatus,</hi> to the now Emperor, as King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> both in the Subscription, and the Superscription. The second urged point was, that neither the <hi>Sile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> nor the <hi>Moravians,</hi> which concurred in the Election of the Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> had any power to do it at that time, but that it was approved at their return home, <hi>ex post facto.</hi> Lastly, all objections made against <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> in point of Regiment, or Intrusion during the life of the Emperor <hi>Matthias,</hi> they are contented, for ought I see, to bestow upon <hi>Matthias</hi> himself.</p>
                     <p>This is the substance of a long Conference, beautifully interlarded with divers praises of the Emperors good nature; which I think truly are due unto him, if he be considered in his own capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: but these Orators could give it no credit, being, as I hear, the greatest inflamers of all this business, and principally the principallest of them; a man saved at the time of the <hi>defenestration, dum regnabat rosa,</hi> only by being here.</p>
                     <p>This is a faithful Relation of all that hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to passed between the Emperor, or his Servants, and me in this place; wherein your Majesty sees, that I have obtained two things: First, a freedom to propound, and next a freedom to send: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors, and my self, have this very day accorded to send joyntly to <hi>Prague,</hi> for there we must begin, even in point of civility. This is but an exploratory, and pretentative pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose between us; about the form whereof, and the
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:102693:301"/>
matter, we shall consult to morrow: and your Majesty immediately upon the return of our Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers from thence, and some feeling of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror here, shall have knowledge of all by another express Currier.</p>

That He would have you give thanks to His Imperial Majesty, for the good respect shewed to His Majesty in your Person, being His Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor; which we conceive, by your Lordships Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to have been every way equal at least, if not beyond those demonstrations that have been afforded the <hi>French;</hi> of which we have received other informations out of <hi>France,</hi> that they have no more then answered their expectations.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That your Lordship can do no better Service to Christ, and to his Majesty, then to open any fair way to a Treaty. <hi>Macte, ergo, &amp; quam nactus es spartam exorna.</hi> You have begun well, wherein you have already <hi>facti plusquam dimidium:</hi> know your own understanding and judgment to be such, and your zeal to the Publick, and to our Great Masters Service, that you will need neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:102693:301"/>
nor further directions for the main, then those you carried along with you:</p>
                     <p>That you are to deal effectually with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, not to proceed too hastily to the publishing of the <hi>Banne,</hi> seeing that would be to deliver over the Patrimony of His Majesties Children unto Strangers; which were an unkinde requital of His Majesties Princely, sincere, and moderate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and proceedings toward him; and must of necessity interest and imbarque His Majesty in the defence of His Childrens inheritance; which His Majesty hopes the Emperor will take into his advised and serious consideration.</p>
                     <p>This is all I have to recommend unto you for the present, as from His Majesty: for my self, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise it my self from you, that you are resolved I am and will remain</p>

                     <p>I Do address the present unto your Lordships, or in your absence to Sir <hi>Francis Nethersole,</hi> by this Gentleman Mr. <hi>Walter Waller,</hi> coming in company of Monsieur <hi>de Sigonie,</hi> whom the <hi>French</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, Duke <hi>d'Angolesme,</hi> Monsieur <hi>de Bethunes,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Preaux,</hi> do conjoyn with me in this Dispatch; the scope whereof I cannot well set down, without first telling what doth lead it. I have been here almost a fortnight, well received
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:102693:302"/>
with all imaginable circumstances due to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Gracious Master. My proposition to the Emperor did consist of these four points:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That it would please him to make known his inclination towards a sincere Treaty upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Motions.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That he would be likewise pleased to instruct me by one, or two, or more Persons, of choice and knowledge, in all the fundamental Arguments touching the merit of the Cause; promising to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present them faithfully to the King my Master.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To condescend to a cessation of Arms for some competent time, least while the Reconcilement is in Treaty, the passions be more and more exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That for the furtherance of these good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Emperor will be pleased to grant Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports for Curriers from <hi>Vienna</hi> towards <hi>Prague,</hi> upon all occasions where his Armies lie.</p>
                     <p>Of these, he hath yielded to the first and last; namely a freedom to treat (whereof I made some doubt) and a freedom to send; whereupon the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadours and my self have joyntly formed this present Dispatch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to this end, that the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> may likewise by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, or by his Majesties Agent there, be drawn as far as we have disposed the Emperor in the first and last points of my Proposition; for to this hour the Prince <hi>Christian</hi> of <hi>Anhalt</hi> (though the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors before my coming had written and expresly sent unto him) hath given no Answer, by which conjecture may be made, whether the foresaid Elector will treat or no, or whether the <hi>Bohemians</hi> will suffer it. Now because if I should end here, so much only as I have hitherto said,
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:102693:302"/>
would scantly import the price of the carriage, we have thought fit (I speak still plurally in the names of the <hi>French</hi> and my self) to acquaint your Lordships, and Sir <hi>Francis Nethersole,</hi> with some ways that have been conceived for the effecting of our Masters good intentions about the Publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                     <p>It hath been first thought very expedient, that both parties were drawn to remit these great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences to a Diet at <hi>Regensburg</hi> of <hi>German</hi> Princes, with intervention of foreign Ambassadors.</p>
                     <p>Next, some have gone so far (and this both the <hi>French</hi> and my self profess to have taken up on the way, even amongst the Friends of the Elector) as to project a form of Agreement upon some such Articles as these that follow.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> be contented to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish the title and possession of the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Emperor <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> according to the first Election of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and by virtue thereof shall enjoy the entire profits and title of the said Crown, during his natural life.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That after the decease of the said Emperor, it shall be free for the <hi>Bohemians</hi> to chuse what King they will, and much more to admit him whom they have designed, namely the <hi>Palatine</hi> Heir apparent.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That for assuring the immunities of that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and future freedom in the exercise of both Religions, the Emperor be contented to commit the Regiment of the said Kingdom to the Naturals thereof.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That of Persons on each side banished, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spiritual or Civil, nothing be said till a full agreement about the rest. Concerning these things
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:102693:303"/>
(I mean as well the Diet as the project) the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadours and my self do joyntly pray your Lordships, or in your absence Sir <hi>Francis Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sole,</hi> by your wisdoms to sound the inclinations of that place where you are, that accordingly we may here, upon your Answer, likewise feel the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror (with whom it were ill manners to begin.) Not fixing our conceits upon this which hath now been represented, but leaving it as a Bears whelp, which may be licked into a better form; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining here both willing and desirous to receive either this better polished, or some new conception from your Lordships, that we may drive to the wished end: Of all which an account hath been given from hence to our Sovereign Master, that his high and Christian wisdom may approve, or alter what it shall please him. And so commending to Almighty God, the God of Peace and Love, your Lordships and the Publick health, I humbly rest,</p>

<pb n="513" facs="tcp:102693:303"/>
delaies we met with at <hi>Dresden,</hi> having made our arrival so late here, that he had not only given overture to the business, but gained such an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, as the present constitution of the state of affairs, and affections of parties would admit: for which we refer you to his Relation to whose en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors the honour is due. You will easily believe, that we would give all the force we could to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond this great good work, so piously intended by our gracious Master, so requisite for Christendom, and so needful to draw our Masters dear Son-in-law, and his blessed Lady, out of the extream diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties they are in, and, in this work, to be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with your wisdom and dexterity. Here you will find ready affections to Peace, to treat, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ways and conveniencies to Treaty, if a cessation of Arms may be accorded: but the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty lies to find the <hi>medium.</hi> The Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the Appurtinances, are the very que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; and they tell you here, that the granting of a disposition thereof, is to overthrow their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, Immunities, and Rights: So to leave the possession of the Kingdom, and to keep it, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>No.</hi> Yet our earnest longing being to see a good end of our gracious Masters blessed designs, we cannot but think of ways to keep on foot the contentment of Traffick with you, and communicate them, though but raw indigested conceptions of our own, to be produced further, if your judgement and hope warrant them. This granted, that both Parties have affection to Treat, doth warrant the freedom of access to the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Whereupon we propound as followeth: That whereas His Majesties Son-in-law (for ought we can find) is resolute to hold both the Title and
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:102693:304"/>
Possession of this Kingdom, it may be advised, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Emperor may be drawn to content himself with the Title, and such a compensation by a yearly proportion of Money, as competerit and equal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators shall judge to be fit. Hereto may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the quitting of <hi>Austria</hi> on the one part, and restitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> on the other. As for banished Men on both sides, and particular Rights, both Civil and Criminal, the same Arbitrators may deal therein according to equity. Having besides Sir <hi>Francis Nethersale</hi>'s faithful endeavors, sounded with our best lines, and we cannot say found the depth, but a kind of scantling, vve offer you to measure, vvhether this heat of War and Confusion may by such a Chanel be drawn to a peaceable Haven; the perfect good steering of vvhich, vve present to your great practice in affairs of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to the good guidance vvhereof, vve offer all our powers and endeavors, vvhile they may be of use; but if vve find no other ground of hope here then vve have hitherto, vve are resolved to dravv towards home; and in that case, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship finding occasion, may continue your addresses to Sir <hi>Francis Nethersole,</hi> of vvhose careful cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence you may rest assured.

                        <note place="margin">27. Styl. nov.</note> Italian.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. THe said Ambassadour began with thanks in the King his Masters Name, for the good Reception he had found here, in all points of due respect to the honour of his Majesty whom he served.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. After this, he said, that as his Majesty had to this hour conserved himself purely neutral in the Business of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> so he would remain hereafter, till more liquid information then he had yet seen from either side, touching the merit of the cause; and would proceed with all real intention in the Christian Office of a Mediatour, without entring into those of a Judge, and much less of a Party.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That although his said Majesty was resolved to suspend his judgement, forasmuch as might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the differences between the Emperour and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians;</hi> yet he found himself tyed both by nature and by reason, not to leave the Patrimonial inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of his own descendents, that is, neither the inferiour nor superiour <hi>Palatinate</hi> in the hands of any alien Usurper: the said Patrimony being a thing seperate from the rest of the present Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, and so understood in the Treaty of <hi>Ulm</hi> by the common consent of the Lieutenants of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the League.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That as his Majesty of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> would be unwillingly perswaded, without the Emperours.
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:102693:305"/>
own affirmation, that the Marquess <hi>Spinola</hi> was by his Order entred hostility into the lower <hi>Palatinate;</hi> so much less could he believe, that his said Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Majesty would lend any Authority <hi>ex post facto</hi> to so injust an intrusion, by way of proscription, or otherwise; with which the moderate proceeding of his Majesty in the whole progress of this Cause, from the very first motions, should be ill recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, The Ambassadour besought his Imperial Majesty, according to the declaration of his Will already passed, to condescend actually to a sincere Treaty upon the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Business, to which the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadours and himself had already joyntly disposed the other part.</p>

                     <p>ALthough I had from Your Majesty a power in my Instructions to depart hence to my other Imployment, as soon as this Controversie should be decided, either by Treaty or by Fortune; yet I have stayed here a moneth and an half after the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, that I might view the final resolutions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I shall now render Your Majesty an accompt: Which I am bound to begin with my humblest thanks for Your benign approbation of my poor endeavours, as I have understood from both Your Secretaries; wherein I see that Your Majesty is still pleased by the excellency of Your Nature, and
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:102693:309"/>
by the indulgency of your judgement, to accept honest zeal for discretion in your own Creature. Serving therefore so good and so gracious a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, I will proceed chearfully to the discharge of the rest, as the affairs stand.</p>
                     <p>By my last to Mr. Secretary <hi>Nanton,</hi> your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty understood the cause of Monsieur <hi>de Preaux</hi> his going into <hi>Hungary:</hi> And by this you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the fruit of his journey: There arriving after news of the defeat before <hi>Prague,</hi> He found much alteration in their faces, and much altercation in their Councels; about vvhich he vvas once publickly admitted; vvhere he undestood passion enough, being the common language of Nature, but nothing else: for they spake in their own Tongue. At last this vvas the Conclusion, That a Gentleman should be immediately dispatched to the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> (supposed at <hi>Preslaw</hi> in <hi>Silesia)</hi> to understand vvhether he vvould joyn vvith the <hi>Hungarians</hi> in a Treaty vvith the Emperor: and in case of either delay or denial, to make a solemn protestation, that they vvould provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: Of the event vvhereof the Prince of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silvania</hi> undertook by the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this Month, <hi>aut circiters</hi> to give knowledge hither.

vvith <hi>Bethelem Gabor</hi> and the <hi>Hungarians</hi> I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do in single consideration (as your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Servant) till vve shall hear vvhether the Elector your Son-in-lavv, and that Kingdom, vvill treat vvith the Emperor conjunctively or no.</p>
                     <p>Before the going of <hi>de Preaux,</hi> I had one access to the Emperor, and two other vvhile he vvas away.</p>
                     <p>The first after consultation here vvith the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors, about the Answer vvhich we had (vvith no small loss of time and advantage) so late received from <hi>Bohemia,</hi> addressed unto me by Sir <hi>Francis Nethersale</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> as it came to him from the Camp.</p>
                     <p>The other two, touching your Majesties decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of your self in the <hi>Palatine</hi> cause, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession against the Emperors <hi>Bann,</hi> as they call it: about vvhich I shall need to trouble your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty no further then vvith the perusal of such Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Notes as I have added both to the foresaid <hi>French</hi> Paper, and to the Emperors two Answers in <hi>Latine,</hi> vvhich come herewith, and contain all that may concern your latter directions in two Letters from Master Secretary <hi>Nanton.</hi> Yet I must not omit, that between the second and third of these Audiences, I vvas visited by the Baron of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenberg</hi> (the Emperors inwardest Counsellor and Favorite) vvho spent an hour or two at my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, vvith much protestation of his Masters respect towards your Majesty; of his grief that things were gone on to such expence of blood; of his vvishes that your Son-in-lavv had rather taken your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties counsel then the Duke of <hi>Bovillons;</hi> of his forgiving nature; of his desire to recover only his own, and to redeem this Imperial House from open scorn: Lastly, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> also had
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:102693:310"/>
vvritten hither, hovv glad he vvould be that your Majesty might have all possible satisfaction. This vvas after the Emperor had been informed of his success at <hi>Prague;</hi> vvhereunto there vvas, as to all other fair discourse of this kind, but one only reply on my part; That your Majesty might justly promise your self very good respect here, and good offices from <hi>Spain,</hi> by the merit of your own moderation in the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Cause, and by your Christian endeavors for the common quiet vvith such perseverance. I must not forget likewise to inform your Majesty, that my self visiting here the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador (as I have usually done after my Audiences vvith the Emperor) and falling (as I thought might vvell become me) into vvonder at <hi>Spinola</hi>'s intrusions, enough to inflame all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom, vvhich your Majesty (measuring other Princes by the equity of your own heart) had no reason to expect. He asked me, after a little deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, <hi>Whether the Marquess of</hi> Buckingham <hi>were not a Gentleman of Honour?</hi> I need not profess how glad. I vvas of such occasion to do your Majesties Dearest Servant, and mine own most Noble Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, all the right that my voice could utter; but in truth, on the other side, extreamly surprized vvith so impertinent a question to my discourse, till he eased me vvith the sight of a Paper out of his Cabinet. It vvas the Copy of a Letter vvritten by my Lord Marquess, in your Majesties Name, to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassador residing vvith you; vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your Majesty did thus far justifie the <hi>Spanish</hi> proceedings, <hi>As never to have made any promise that they would not assail the</hi> Palatinate. Whereupon this Ambassador inferred, that the said Letter vvritten by so Noble a Personage, and in your Majesties
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:102693:310"/>
Name, vvas a high discharge for <hi>Spain</hi> in the point of real dealing. I replied, That indeed I had never heard of any direct promises, or denial made about that matter; but that your Majesties Servants em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed therein (whereof I vvas one my self to the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopoldus)</hi> did rather complain of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers obseure and ambiguous, and very different from our plain <hi>English</hi> style. This vvas all that passed between the Conde <hi>d'Ogniate</hi> and me, into vvhich I have a little digressed. Novv then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect hovv vve stand here in point of Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The Prince of <hi>Transilvania</hi> hath prefixed the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of this Month, or thereabout, (as I said before) for his Term; within which he will signifie in what manner he intendeth to Treat, according to the Answer out of <hi>Silesia.</hi> The Emperor on the other side, did take the term of forty days for the declaring of his mind fully to me and the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors, which expire, by our computation, on the 27. of this said Month; intending in the mean time to preconsult with his Friends, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as we perceive) with his Fortunes: And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, <hi>Not to Treat of any Province, or part, as then reduced to his obedience.</hi> So as plainly enough he chose that respite to contemplate the intervenient changes: For at first he was more tractable; he spake of no Friends whose advices were before to be asked; he demanded no term to think farther on the matter; he added no restriction: all these are the suggestions of his prosperity. And so we stand in point of business.</p>
                     <p>In the state of the Provinces I can deliver no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but fluctuation and submission, the ordinary consequences of Victory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="528" facs="tcp:102693:311"/>
The first were the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> who forgetting both Oaths and Contracts, yielded up the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Patent of their Combination to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> as the Emperors Commissary.</p>
                     <p>The next were the <hi>Moravians;</hi> who after the Count <hi>Bucquoy</hi> had taken <hi>Trigla,</hi> one of their wealthiest, and summoned <hi>Zuam,</hi> the chiefest of their Towns, resolved in a full Assembly of their States, to submit themselves by Deputies, who are hourly expected here.</p>
                     <p>The other Appendants to the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Crown are likely to follow the <hi>Moravian</hi> example, being incomparably (as hath well appeared) the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute piece of the whole knot, and that which gave vigour to the rest, <hi>dum Troja stabat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What the <hi>Hungarians</hi> shall determine of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, I will set down in a Postscript; for which I have long suspended the dispatch of this Bearer.</p>
                     <p>I cannot conclude without representing unto your Majesty, in all event, two humble remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, vvhereof your higher wisdom may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance make some use.</p>
                     <p>The first is, That I conceive the <hi>French</hi> King bound to joyn with your Majesty in the <hi>Palatine</hi> Cause: I do not mean only by reason of state and jealousie of this spreading House, <hi>cujus gliscit po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia,</hi> as I may modestly say, nor by Ancient ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation and gratitude to the said Electoral Line, or to your own Kingdoms in the needful days of hi, Father, but by a fresher band, even by the Treaty of <hi>Ulm,</hi> where his Embassadors did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene: For they tell me, that by virtue thereof, neither <hi>directè nec indirectè,</hi> any of the Provinces belonging to the League, or to the Union, could be molested by either side. Which the Electors of
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:102693:311"/>
                        <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Colen</hi> have broken by permission of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola;</hi> nay, divers ways, by subministration of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to his Army. And I hear, that to save themselves, they have procured Patents from the Emperor, that as his Commissaries, they may do some things which they could not do or permit as Leaguers. Always sure I am, that the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> did three or four days withstand the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating of the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors in the foresaid Treaty, which the other side did as vehemently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; for no other imaginable reason, within my penetration, then only to engage <hi>France</hi> in the maintenance thereof. This I have touched, not that I doubt of your accommodating of those things civily without Arms, or that your Majesty shall need (if extremity require the sharpest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies) any help to vindicate your own Descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents from violence; but because <hi>en tout cas</hi> the conjunction of <hi>France</hi> would be some ease to the Princes of the Union, whereof your Majesty is the head.</p>
                     <p>The other point that I am bold to offer unto your Majesties consideration, is, That the King of <hi>Spain</hi> himself is bound by his own protestation to revoke <hi>Spinola:</hi> For therein he declareth, that his meaning was not by assisting the Emperour, <hi>Cuiquam Mortalium per injuriam vim inferre, aut in aliena cupiditatem suam extendere:</hi> which protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Emperor received from his own Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor in the <hi>Spanish</hi> Court, and by his Secretary here did communicate the same with me, to be sent unto your Majesty, as I did in my first Dispatch; and have now again sent another Copy, least the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer should be strayed. And so with my humble
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:102693:312"/>
Prayers to the eternal God for your blessed health and joy, I ever rest,</p>

                        <p>The expected Advertisement is now come from the Prince of <hi>Transilvania</hi> to this effect. He great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complaineth of the faintness and defection of his Confederates in general: And in particular, first, that an Ambassage which he addressed since the Battel to the <hi>Moravians,</hi> with animating per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, took no place. Next, that the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> (to whom he expresly sent into <hi>Silesia Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes Krauss,</hi> Secretary of the Kingdom of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia)</hi> hath not vouchsafed him any clear or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Answer to the Subject of his Errand, which I have before set down. Nay farther, that the Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Hollock,</hi> came joyntly together unto the said <hi>Iohannes Krauss</hi> in <hi>Preslaw,</hi> and there among other discourse told him, <hi>That the remainder of this affair was not to be handled by the</hi> French <hi>Ambassadors, nor by me here;</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> take very sensibly, especially their offer and intercession having before by the said Prince of <hi>Anhalt</hi> been unaccepted, and a Letter which they wrote unto him, to this hour unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered; though sent by Monsieur <hi>de Ste Catherine,</hi> no suspected person, but one who had been so long resident in the <hi>Palatiae</hi> Court. Upon which premises, they have seriously desired me to testifie unto your Majesty (as in truth I am bound) their
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:102693:312"/>
willingness to have mediated in this cause, and their continual frank and faithful conferences with me about the common end. On the other side, I have desired them to represent things fairly to the King their Master, and not upon any private distaste to abandon the common interest, which so many Princes have in the subsistence of the <hi>Palatine.</hi> Since this Advertisement from <hi>Bethelem Gabor</hi> and his <hi>Hungarians</hi> (who are resolved to Treat singly, and have sent hither to propound it) we have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten knowledge, that such a Letter is come to the Emperor from the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> touching the <hi>Palatine</hi> Elector, as makes us conceive he will use his mediation rather then ours: So as I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring towards <hi>Venice</hi> in this hard season, where (as your Majesties Servant) I have the honour to be much expected and desired, as I hear by their Resident in this place; especially the Republick standing in no small perplexity and sollicitude at the present divers ways. There I shall attend your Majesties farther directions, and leave the <hi>French</hi> (as I found them) upon this Stage, till they get leave to depart, for which they have dispatched home an express Currier, intending in the mean time to deal between the Emperour and <hi>Bethelem Gabor.</hi>

                     <p>Be it known unto all and every one, that seeing as well within the Sacred Empire of <hi>Germany,</hi> as in divers Kingdoms and Neighbouring Estates, Troubles and Tumults, and Alterations have been on foot, and long continued, whereas not the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks only, but the Electors, Princes, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate States of the Religion, have taken oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to Arm themselves, which indeed hath been the cause of great differences and misprisions, if these preparations of Arms, and levy of Souldiers should proceed further on both sides, to offend and destroy one another: Therefore that such despight may be removed, and good friendship between both Parties in the Empire established, We have made a firm and constant Agreement, by means likewise of the <hi>French</hi> Ambassadors, which were at that time in the Imperial City of <hi>Ulm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And first of all, We <hi>Maximilian</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> as General of the Catholick League, by virtue of our Authority; and We <hi>Ioachim Ernest</hi> Marquess of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> as Lieutenant General of the Union, by virtue of our Authority, in the presence and approbation also of other Princes, States, Alliants, Deputies with full Power and Authority, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and vow for our Selves of each Party, Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, Electors, Princes, and States, by all the real Words of Truth and Fidelity, in the best and most stable form that may or ought hold, or stand firm by all the Rules of Right, That none Electors, Princes, Alliants, States, of either Party, in what manner soever, or under whatsoever pretence, neither by themselves nor any other, shall with
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:102693:313"/>
Arms pertaining to either Party, offend or cut off the Treaty of Peace, nor discommodate, pillage, spoil, attaint, or trouble one another, nor any thing to them belonging, as Electoralities, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, Subjects, Towns, Villages, Revenues Ecclesiastical or Civil: But that as well the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks with the Gospellers, as they again with the Catholicks, be and remain in true and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Peace, Concord, and Charity, every of them secure in their own Proprieties, without fear of Trouble or Assault. And to the end that this Promise and Confidence (being otherwise required and enjoyned between Princes and Neighbouring Estates, by Constitutions of the Empire) may faithfully be continued, it is provided, That the two Armies here near encamped, with all possible speed remove out of the places where they were pitched, without any detriment to either Party, and that they lodge not together in one place.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is concluded, That if perchance any Elector, Prince, Confederate, State, of either Party, or indeed either of them in gross, should require upon necessity a Passage, by virtue of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Empire, for the Defence and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of them and their Subjects, having first peaceably given sufficient Caution, neither of them ought to deny it: Provided the same requisition be seasonably made, not upon rash and precipitate Advice, when the Army be upon the Frontiers, or indeed within the Territories of them, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint or discommodity of the Subject.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Forasmuch as We <hi>Maximilian</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and other Electors, Princes, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Estates and Alliants, have excluded from this present Treaty the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> with the Incorporated Provinces, and other States He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:102693:314"/>
of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended within the Treaty, only the Electorals, and Countries belonging to Electors, Princes, and States Confederates of either Party, under which also is contained the Electoral <hi>Palatinate,</hi> with all Inheritances thereunto belonging, scituate within the Empire; They ought not to be expended fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, seeing at this present we persist not in these differences, that having nothing common with the rest, but we will keep good Correspondence with them without any suspition: Which likewise We <hi>Ioachim Ernest</hi> Marquess of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> do agree to the Resolution of the Electors, Princes, and States Catholick, touching the Kingdom of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> and the United Provinces, with other Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances appertaining to the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> for Us, our Alliants, Electors, Princes and States; and We will no less on our side, that the said Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> with the United Provinces and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries Hereditary to the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> be not comprised in this Treaty, understanding as well this Declaration to be for the Electoralities, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, and Estates scituate and being within the Empire.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Whereas during this Treaty, divers times mention hath been made of the Griefs of the Empire not yet decided, the decision of the same is remitted to some more convenient time, seeing this was too short, and the Grievances touched not only those of either Party, but in general all, both Catholick and Evangelical States of the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, concerning which, for this present, there is no sufficient Power or Authority to determine.</p>
                     <p>And seeing both of either Party pretend losses and damages done and received by either side, and
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:102693:314"/>
particularly at the Village of <hi>Sandthaim,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, it shall be shortly treated of reasonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution for the same.

                     <p>The deputed Cardinals of the Congregation or Committee in <hi>Rome</hi> touching his Majesties Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Treaty vvith <hi>Spain, having resolved negatively, even after six</hi> Assemblies; <hi>the Cardinal</hi> Ludovisio <hi>and the</hi> Spanish <hi>Ambassador</hi> vvent joyntly to the <hi>Pope,</hi> to pray him, <hi>that by no means the negative resolution might be divulged as yet, but suppressed</hi> for a time; because some turns vvere to be done by the concealment thereof.

observing that the foresaid <hi>Congregation had voted,</hi> and that their censures vvere concealed; comes to <hi>the Cardinal</hi> Ludovisio, <hi>the</hi> Popes <hi>Nephew,</hi> before-named, and extracts from him the vvhole matter, vvith the means and reason of the suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.

Be it how it vvill; as to his Majesty doth belong the Soveraignty of judgement; so to his poor honest Creatures abroad, the liberty of rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a frank discharge of our zeal and duties.

Neither did I need any new immediate Command from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, to serve in the Cause of his own descendents, especially after your Letters of the 19th, of <hi>January,</hi> by Order vvhereof I had before in his Royal Name made a general exploration here of their good vvill towards us, and now by the present imployment of the foresaid <hi>Calandrini,</hi> as also upon Letters from the Elector to this Duke, (vvhereof the delivery and pursuit vvas recommended to me) I found apt occasion to descend <hi>à Thesi ad Hypothesin;</hi> vvhich vvith vvhat discretion it hath been handled, I dare not say; but sure I am, vvith as much zeal and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as the capacity of my heart could hold; vvhereof the accompt is now due, as followeth:</p>
                     <p>Two full Audiences I had upon this Subject at mine own demand, and a third at their calling as long as both the former. In my first (to make it appear more serious then an ordinary duty) I told them I vvould do that vvhich I had never done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For vvhereas vve commonly leave the refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of our Propositions to a Secretary of the State, vvho stands alwayes by the Ambassador, and is the transporter both of our Arguments and of our affections to the Senate: The Tribunal vvhere vve speak being not diffinitive (vvhich is no small dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage)
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:102693:316"/>
I now promised to ease his memory my self vvith an extract of vvhat I had said, vvhich vvas accordingly sent him the next morning, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining two principal heads:</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The merit of the Cause;</item>
                        <item>2. The community of the Interest;</item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Both as clear as the Sun. For touching the first, the question now vvas only <hi>de recuperatione proprii,</hi> violently invaded: In the course of vvhich action, it did appear by pregnant inferences, lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, together vvith those intercepted Letters vvhich Frier <hi>Hiacintho,</hi> an out-cast from this Town, did carry in his Wallet, that the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had practised the Electorate of <hi>Rhine</hi> before the true Elector vvas called to the Crown of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> vvhich I thought the fitter to be touched; for that I knew the Duke had newly received a Copy of the said divulged Letters from his Agent at the <hi>Hague,</hi> and it vvas a point of great impression.</p>
                     <p>Now their Interest vvas as plain as the Case it self: For if such violences shadowed vvith Imperial Authorities, should likewise be countenanced and comforted vvith success, vvhat could hinder, vvithin a vvhile, the same Torrent to overflow <hi>Italy,</hi> and especially this Dominion, <hi>circondato da affetti poco sicuri d'ogni intorno,</hi> as I told them I might vvell say, even vvith modesty. These premisses being laid, I inferred, that his Majesty, upon a Cause so just, and a common Interest so clear, vvas most confident in the vvisdome of this grave Senate, that having spent vvith palpable benefit in their last Motions of fresh memory <hi>qualche bona sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> (indeed about two millions of Duckats) to maintain a diversion so near at hand as <hi>il Piede delli Monti,</hi> they vvould find it more reasonable to
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:102693:316"/>
foment the like further off; all diversions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions (both Politick and Natural) being so much the more effectual, by how much the more remote. Lastly, that though his Majesty in exchange of that open, frank, and voluntary Declaration, which he made of himself heretofore in time of their Troubles, might now expect the like again from them <hi>ex aequo;</hi> and that no Prince living knevv better what the declared Authority of a Dominion so eminent, vvould import to the sum of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness. Yet not to press his Friend too far, his Majesty vvould be contented vvith a silent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution without noise, under any form that should best please them, and in such proportion as should be conformable to their Love; whereby they should oblige his Royal Person and Progeny, not to be wanting unto them in any of their own just Occurrents. This was the substance of my first Audience, and of my Memorial sent to the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. At my second, after I had pressed the same Inducements more effectually, and informed them that the Elector was now gone in Person to add vigor to his Subjects, so as their help could never come in a better season: I fell to tell the Duke, that though it could not become my simplicity to prescribe any form to so wise a Prince, yet I would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>rave leave to insinuate thus much that they might under the Name of the States (with whom their Confederacy was already known) pass their good will towards his Majesty and his Son-in-law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further imaginable noise, by adding what they should please moreover to that Contribution (whereunto they are tied by League) of 50000 <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins,</hi> or 5000 <hi>l. sterling per mensem,</hi> for which surcrew (whatsoever it should be) the States would be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:102693:317"/>
to the Elector. Nay farther, I told him, albeit now by long service, and by the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of my zeal towards them, I might presume to merit some part of their confidence; yet I would therein dispence even with mine own ambition, and undertake as much likewise for Signior <hi>Calan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drini,</hi> leaving it free unto them to exercise their friendship through the hands of Signior <hi>Surriano,</hi> their own Minister at the <hi>Hague,</hi> without acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us here with their determination, for the more silent carriage thereof: yet withal, I was not tender to re-intimate unto them, that both the King my Master did merit a Noble and open Proceeding; and on the other side, this Republick was by Gods blessing so powerful, as they should not need to smother their Resolutions in so just a Cause. In conclusion I told him, that I did languish for the Senates answer; for well I knew that they are much guided, like the wisdom of a Merchant, by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, which makes them so prone to defer, still hearkening how things fall or rise, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly shaping their Counsels. Between these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences Signior <hi>Calandrini</hi> did likewise twice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceed in name of the States, whose perswasion (as their Instrument) he spent apart from mine, though otherwise our agreement was well enough known.</p>
                     <p>On <hi>Wednesday</hi> last, some five or six days after my second Audience, I was called to college, and the Senates Answer read unto me very loud and treatably, as the Duke willed the Secretary; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of yet I required a second reading, for Copies are not usually granted; which I must note for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disadvantage of moment in negotiating with this State, because they may appeal from our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories.
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:102693:317"/>
In this Answer were repeated, with some new beautifying, the three points wherein they did pretend to have prevented his Majesties for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer imploration of their concurrence, when he wrote his own Letters in behalf of his Son-in-law. The three points were these:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Their Contribution to the States, by which they maintain in those Provinces 4000 men.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Their Entertainment and Pensioning of the Count <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> with intent to fix him where he is, who else might have been drawn away by other offers.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Their Promise to joyn with the <hi>French</hi> King and <hi>Savoy</hi> in the <hi>Rhetian</hi> business.</p>
                     <p>All which three, they call Points of Common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest with his Majesty, and of Common Benefit to the Elector by way of Diversion; and two of them Actual Ingagements of this Republick. Now to these in the foresaid Answer, they added a fourth, for a little stronger excuse at the present; namely, a fresh and sharp Insurrection amongst the <hi>Grisons,</hi> where the Patriots of the <hi>Dieci dritture,</hi> seemed to have overmatched the Party of the Arch-duke <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poldo</hi> with such considerable success, that the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>on of <hi>Surick</hi> (who are nearest the truth) are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in some motion to help them; so as this State expecteth also to be called to that Feast, and well inclined thereunto. This was all the new garnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I could observe in their Answer. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end whereof I was much surprized with their telling me, in plain terms, that his Majesty was well satisfied with those former Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their good will in the Common Cause, represented unto him by their Ambassador <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>do,</hi> as he had written hither. To which Point, though
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:102693:318"/>
the last of theirs, I replied first, That indeed his Majesty (whose excellent heart doth believe always the best of his Friends) had no reason to mislike their former Answer: And so far I had co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with their own Instrument, as to represent it <hi>con buon' sapore;</hi> but yet no further then the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would bear, which was but a generality of good will, and no direct satisfaction. And whereas now they did desire me likewise to reiterate to the King my Master, their great sensibility of the Common Interest; I told them ingeniously <hi>con un' stringer di spalle,</hi> that I knew not well how to do it, till they gave me more subject: For Philosophy (whose naked Principles I had more studied then Art of Language) had taught me, even in one of her most Fundamental Maxims, that <hi>ex nihilo nihil fit.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Duke fell very seriously to dilate upon the Senates Answer, and left me indeed with some occasion of contentment: For he told me, I might mark by the said Answer, a Resolution in the Senate not to neglect a Cause wherein they held themselves so interessed, and (as had been said before) already actually ingaged, though the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Grisons,</hi> and the new noise from thence did at the present distract them. Of this I took presently hold; replying, That I would receive this Speech as a Commentary upon the Senates An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; and represent unto his Majesty, that when the principal reason of their excuse should cease, namely, these fresh stirrings so near them, which seemed to require their abetment, then they would give us more particular satisfaction. For which (to rivet it the better) I gave thanks, and told him, I would hearken after the issue of this <hi>Rhetian</hi> noise, and accordingly put him in mind again of our own
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:102693:318"/>
necessities: to which he gave me <hi>un gratioso accena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mènto,</hi> and so fell to tell me, with extream gladness, their news of the late defeat given by <hi>Mansfelt</hi> to the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Troops.</p>
                     <p>Now to collect the fruit of my poor endeavors, thus we stand; If action shall grow on this side, we shall surely receive more benefit by that diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, then we should by contribution: For the Arch-duke <hi>Leopoldo</hi> would by chance be drawn from <hi>Alsatia</hi> to think of <hi>Tirol;</hi> and the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> and <hi>Milan</hi> Levies, which should supply <hi>Germany,</hi> will be spent here. If <hi>Italy</hi> be quiet, then <hi>(dicam audax verbum)</hi> this State must necessarily help us, that it may be so stil; for I shall not need to make them sensible of the vicissitude of humane, troubles, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here or there, which is their common Text: But all dependeth upon his Majesties urging of his own merits, which was my highest Argument, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with that Obligation which he will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as his own gracious Letters import.</p>
                     <p>This account I send with some diligence, that it may prevent the new <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambassadors first Audience, or at least the leave-taking of the old; into whom it may please his Majesty to infuse his good thoughts, and to take notice of these Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which I had here in the way of his Service. And so the Lord of Heaven bless Him and His.</p>

<pb n="546" facs="tcp:102693:320"/>
22. of the said Moneth, at His Majesties Colledge of <hi>Eton,</hi> that I should examine the Lord of <hi>Olde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare</hi>'s Daughter, now resident in the Town of <hi>Windsor,</hi> in the circumstances of a business which His Majesty had committed to my trust; <hi>vid.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a certain Roll of Names mentioned in a late malicious diffamatory Pamphlet, which one <hi>George Eglisham</hi> had scattered in Print; pretending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that it was a Roll of divers great Personages which were to be poysoned by the now Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and among those Great ones, the said <hi>George Eglisham</hi> himself for one; which said Roll (as the said <hi>Eglisham</hi> affirmeth) the foresaid Daughter of the Lord <hi>Oldebare</hi> had brought to the late Lord Marquess of <hi>Hamilton</hi> her Cousin, who was one of the inrolled to be poysoned; grounding this defamation upon the testimony of that Roll, brought by the said Gentlewoman to the foresaid Marquess: I say, According to His Majesties Command herein, I <note place="margin">When I had first enquired out her Lodging.</note> repaired, the next day after the receit thereof, to the said Lord of <hi>Oldebare</hi>'s Daughter, by Name <hi>Anne Lion,</hi> (though not nominated by the foresaid <hi>Eglisham,</hi> but under her Fathers Title) at her Lodging in <hi>Windsor,</hi> where I found her accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with her younger Sister, and a Gentlewoman of her attendance, who were all three in the Room while I spake with her, and I brought in with me Mr. <hi>Michael Branthwait,</hi> heretofore His Majesties Agent in <hi>Venice,</hi> as a Gentleman of approved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and sincerity. At my access unto her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I was a stranger, and the business somewhat harsh and umbrageous, I laboured to take from her all manner of shadow touching her self; which in
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:102693:320"/>
truth I found very needless: For after I had shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her my Commission, and the places in <hi>Eglisham</hi>'s Book wherein she was traduced for a Witness of this foul defamation, she was so far from disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing or reserving any circumstance, that she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all my inquisitiveness in some Questions which I had prepared, making a clear, a free, and a noble report of all that had passed, which she did dictate unto me, as I wrote in her Window, in her own words, without any inforcement or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, as followeth:</p>
                     <p>At His Majesties being in <hi>Spain,</hi> a Carr-man of one <hi>Smith</hi> a Woodmonger in <hi>Westminster,</hi> found a Paper, as he said, and gave it to my Mothers Foot-man to read, whose Name was <hi>Thomas Allet,</hi> who brought it immediately to me; it was half a sheet of Paper laid double by the length, and in it was written in a scribled hand, the Names of a number (above a dozen) of the Privy Counsel: some words had been written more, which were scraped out. The Names were not writ in order as they were of quality. In it, next to the Marquess of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> was writ, Dr. <hi>Eglisham</hi> to imbalm him. No mention of poysoning, or any such thing, but very Names. I not knowing what it might import more, the Marquess of <hi>Hamilton</hi> not being at that instant in <hi>Whitehall,</hi> I sent for <hi>Iames Steward</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and desired him to shew his Lord that Paper, wherein was his Name. He said he would not present it himself, but would give it to <hi>Alexander Heatley,</hi> his Secretary: So he took the Paper from me; and within a day or two after he brought it back to me, and said, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary thought it not necessary to trouble his Lord with all, for as he did conceive, some that
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:102693:321"/>
had a Cause to be heard before the Privy Counsel, or in the Star Chamber, had written these Names to help his own memory, to reckon who would be with him or against him. Immediately then I sent the said <hi>Allet</hi> to <hi>David Strachen,</hi> Servant to the Marquess of <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and bade him give that to his Lord from me immediately; which he said he did, and that his Lord read it, and put it in his Pocket.</p>
                     <p>These are the very express and formal words, which this noble Gentlewoman, with a very frank and ingenious spirit, as I am bound to testifie of her, did dictate to me, in the presence of the above-named: Whereby may appear to any reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature, what a silly piece of malice this was, when Mr. <hi>Alexander Heatley,</hi> a Gentleman of sober judgement, to whom the Roll was first sent, though that be concealed by <hi>Eglisham,</hi> did think it too frivolous to be so much as once shewed to his Master, howsoever named therein. At this first Conference, as I was ready to depart, my Lord of <hi>Oldebare</hi>'s Daughter desired of me a view of the Book, out of which I had read her some passages, wherein her Name was traduced; which could in no equity be denied. So I left it with her till the next day, praying that I might then have her full judgement of it: When repairing again unto her, she told me as freely as the rest, in the hearing of the same company as before, except her Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that <hi>Eglisham</hi> had gone upon very slight grounds in so great a matter.</p>

                     <p>I Send unto your Grace by this Bearer, Mr. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Branthwait,</hi> the Examination of the Lord of <hi>Oldebare</hi>'s Daughter, touching the Roll of Names said to be found in <hi>Westminster,</hi> of Great Personages which were to be poysoned here, while you were in <hi>Spain:</hi> In the delivery whereof, I have been carefull, as an Examiner, and Relater, to set down nothing but her bare and free report; which is the Historical part: The Critical now remaineth; for after the examination of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, there is a liberty of judgement.</p>
                     <p>I have seen many defamatory and libellous things of this nature, abroad and at home; though for the most part alwayes without truth, yet often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times contrived with some credibility: But this appeareth, in the whole contexture, utterly void of both, even though we had never known your Grace; nay, I will say more, though we had known you to be as bad, and as black, as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would paint you. For first, the main ground upon which he would raise this defamation, is the foresaid Roll of Names, found, forsooth, not in a Cabinet, but in a dirty Street. Now, when we come to hunt it home, the authentical Instruments that should give it credit, are a Carrman, and a Footman; till at last it came to Mr. <hi>Alexander Heatley:</hi> a Gentleman indeed (as I have conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him) of sound abilities. Then what does he with it? Marry, He thought it so frivolous, that albeit it had passed to him through the hands of a noble Gentlewoman of his own Countrey, yet he
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:102693:322"/>
vvould not once trouble the late Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> his Master so much as vvith a sight of it, though his said Master vvas one of the inrolled.

                     <p>Much more might be said upon the matter: but I value, not only your Graces, but mine own time at a greater price: Yet I have committed a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance or two to this Bearer; for vvhose sincerity I am bound to answer, because I did choose him for a Witness in the Examination. One scruple only I had in point of formality, Whether I should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress this accompt or no to the Counsel. Table, vvhence I received the Commission. But consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it came unto me, though by Order from thence, yet under the Kings trust; I have directed it to your hands, vvhom it most concerneth.</p>

                     </head>
                     <opener>
                        <salute>Most Resplendent Queen, even is the darkness of Fortune,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I Most humbly salute Your Majesty again, after the longest silence that I have ever held with You, since I first took into my heart an image of Your excellent Vertues. My thoughts indeed have from the exercise of outward duties been confined within my self, and deeply wounded with mine own private griefs and losles; which I was afraid, if I had written sooner to Your Majesty, before time had dryed them up, would have freshly bled again. And with what shall I now entertain Your sweet Spirits? It becomes not my weakness, to speak of deep and weighty Counsels, nor my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateness, of great Personages: Yet because I know Your Majesty cannot but expect, I should say somewhat of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> whom all contemplate, I will begin there; and end in such comforts as I can suggest to Your present Estate: which shall be ever the Subject both of my Letters and of my prayers. But before I deliver my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:102693:323"/>
of the said Duke, I must use a little Preface. I am two wayes tyed unto him: First, for his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular love to my never forgotten <hi>Albertus;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in likewise concurring with Your Majesties inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable affection. Next, for mine own particular, I hold by his mediation this poor place, as indeed, for the benefit, I may well call it, though not for the contentment: But if it were worth Millions, or Worlds, I protest unto Your Majesty (to whom I owe the bottome of my heart) I would not speak otherwise of him, then I conceive. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, setting aside both fears of Parliament, and hopes of Court, I will spend my opinion, which is all my freehold.</p>
                     <p>And truly (my most gracious and Royal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress) I cannot weigh his Case without much wonder: being one of the strangest (all consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) that I ever yet took into my fancy. Not, that the Commons assembled should sift and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now the actions even of the highest of the Nobility: Not, that an obscure Physician then among them (ambitious of some glory out of his own professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) should dare to give the first onset on so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a Personage: Not, that such a popular pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit once begun by one, and seconded by a few other, should quickly kindle a greater Party. These are in their nature no marvels, nor Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Neither can I greatly muse, that in a young Gentleman, during thirteen years of such prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and power, the heighth of his place exposing him to much observation and curiosity; the Lower House l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>kewise opening the way to all kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, (as they did;) and examining nothing upon Oath, (as they never do;) there should be matter enough gleaned to make up thirteen Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:102693:323"/>
and none of heinous degree: For after such boltings to the quick, even among men of far meaner managements, I think there would be found every where some Bran. Therefore I can pass all this over with easie belief. But there is a consideration or two, which do much confound my judgement. First, for the matter it self: That this very Noble man, who at the Parliament of 1623. was so universally applauded and celebrated in every corner, as a great Instrument of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, (in so much as for my part, I conceived him then to be that which few or none had been before in all ages, No less Favorite, I mean, to the People, then to the King) should now be persued with these dislikes, when for the most part the very same Objectors were in the foresaid Parliament, and the very same Objections (except one or two) might as well then have been alledged: This is, I must confess to my understanding a Labyrinth. Again, When (from the matter turning to the Person) I view the fairness and equality of his temper and carriage, I can in truth descry in his own nature, no original excitement of such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staste, which commonly ariseth, not so much from high fortune, as from high looks. For I most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniously avow unto your Majesty, that among all the Favorites which mine eyes have beheld in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Courts, and times, I never saw before a strong heart, and eminent condition, so clearly void of all pride and swelling arrogancy, either in his face or in his fashion.</p>
                     <p>These are partly the Reasons that make me vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, hovv such offence should grovv like a mush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome in a night. But there is one thing above all other that hath strucken deepest into my mind,
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:102693:324"/>
and made me see, hovv the greatest men have this unfortunate adjunct in their felicity, to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obnoxious to the foulest and falsest reports; vvhereof in the person of this very Duke himself, I shall lay a monstrous example before your Majesty, out of mine own particular knowledge and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
                     <p>It pleased my Sovereign novv being, to direct unto me hither a Commission to examine my Lord of <hi>Oldebares</hi> Daughter, by name Mistress <hi>Anne Lion</hi> (I think sometimes not unknown unto your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty) then resident at <hi>Windsor,</hi> about an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Pamphlet published and printed towards the time of the last Parliament, in divers Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, by one Doctor <hi>Eglisham,</hi> a <hi>Scottish</hi> Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, vvho therein chargeth the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> vvith such trifles as these: The death of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>Hamilton,</hi> his near Friend and Ally; the death of our late King, of ever blessed memory, his most dear Master; the intended deaths of divers Counsellors of Estate, his Associates: painting, in effect, a nature far beyond that of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, vvhen he vvas Duke of <hi>Glocester.</hi> And for a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness hereof he traduceth the foresaid Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or rather as the main ground of his vvhole Book: vvhich occasioned her examination, at the Dukes pursuit against himself; whereof I send your Majesty a Copy herewith, as I took it from her own free delivery; vvherein you shall see a bare Note of a few Counsellors Names, found at first, not in the Dukes Cabinet, but in the very kennel of <hi>King-street</hi> by a Car-man, Servant to a Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger: Secondly, by him brought to a Foot-man; by which honourable degrees it came to the Gentlewoman all dirty. And at last, it is turned
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:102693:324"/>
by this Doctor into Bill of Personages to be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, out of a very charitable interpretation then reigning in him. I am doubtful, what passion it will most stir in your Majesty, when you read the Circumstances; whether meer laughter at such a ridiculous slander, or a noble indignation at so desperate impudency. And so not to stay any longer upon this Cobweb, I will end with such comforts as I propound to my self in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your present being.</p>
                     <p>The first shall be a general impression which we have taken of his Majesties Nature: And it is this, That he is not only (to consider him absolutely in his own composition) of singular virtue and piety, and resolution in good; but likewise (to consider him relatively) he is an excellent Husband, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Friend. I call Favorites the Friends of Kings, as your Majesty (who is so well versed in the best of Books) knows I may do with very good warrant: For was not <hi>Hushai</hi> the <hi>Archite</hi> so styled to <hi>David,</hi> and after him <hi>Zahud</hi> to <hi>Solomon?</hi> Nay, had not the Highest of all Examples, in the time of his Humane lowness, both among the living a Beloved that lay on his bosome, and another also whom he calls his Friend, even when he called him from the dead? Thus much I could not abstain to let fall from my pen, by the way, against all mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers at any singularity of affection, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound both in States and Families. But of these three Relations, I will now only contemplate that which respecteth your Majesty; which indeed is as clear and visible as the rest: For surely all the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that our most Gracious Sovereign hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto assembled, and all the Actions that he hath undertaken abroad, either of himself or by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations,
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:102693:325"/>
and his private Counsels at home, have principally levelled at your support and restore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as the Deliberations likewise that went before, in the latter time of your most blessed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So as your Majesty, in the justness of your Cause, and in the sweetness of your Nature, doth stand firmly invested in both the titles of as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved a Sister as you were a Daughter. And I am confident, that our living and loving God, who did accept the zeal of your Royal Brother, and bless his own and the publick devotions at home, with almost a miraculous conversion of the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which raged, into health, and of the sterility which was feared, into plenty; will likewise find his own good time to favour our pursuits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
                     <p>Your Majesties second comfort, is the universal love of all good Minds. To which I may justly add, a particular zeal in him who is nearest his Majesty, to foment his best desires towards you; which he hath expressed sundry times within my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>The last and inwardest consolation that I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present unto your Majesty, is your self, your own soul, your own vertues, your own Christian constancy and magnanimity: Whereby your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty hath exalted the glory of your sex, conquered your affections, and trampled upon your adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. To conclude, you have shewed the World, that though you were born within the chance, yet without the power of fortune.</p>
                     <p>And so having sought to redeem so long a silence, I tear. with too long a trouble; I will promise your Majesty to commit no more of the former
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:102693:325"/>
fault, and humbly beg your pardon for the other: ever and ever remaining,</p>

                     <p>THe Queens last Letter (wherewith her Majesty did too much honour me) coming when my voices of any value were no more in mine own power, was nearer a torment then a surprizal. It shall teach me to reserve my self, as wiser men do, for such supervenient temptations, I must confess, above all strength, if the least possibility had been lest. It is true, I could have given him a latter place: but in that, I should have disgraced the suiter, and disrespected the Commander. I have therefore rather chosen to put him in the Vanguard the next year, being the Son of a Souldier, then now in the Rear. And this is the summe of my humble answer to her Majesty, though in other terms.</p>
                     <p>Your <hi>Anthony</hi> (who is my Guest every <hi>Saturday</hi> night) is well grown in stature, and more in knowledge. I verily believe he will prove both a wise and learned man, and certainly good. We have passed over <hi>quocun<expan>

Wherein, according to my usual fashion, I have lost four or five friends, and yet I thank God, not gotten the value of one <hi>Harrington:</hi> So as they are angry at me on the one side, and they laugh at me on the other. If my most gracious Mistress will in her goodness be pleased to drown her displeasure till the next turn, I shall chearfully in the mean time, bear the weight of mine own simplicity.</p>
                     <p>I have gotten, with much adoe, some of the <hi>Psalms</hi> translated by my late most blessed Master, for the young Prince of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> (which is one of your memorials that have slept too long by me) and I have ransacked mine own poor Papers for some entertainment for the Queen: which shall be sent together. Though it be now a misery to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visit the fancies of my youth, which my judgement tells me, are all too green, and my glass tells me, that my self am gray. Till my next, let me trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you no farther. The love of God be with us, and we are well.</p>

Therefore, I do not only joy, but glory (though still with humble acknowledgement and feeling what my self am) that You have been pleased (as I understand from my Lord of <hi>Dorchester)</hi> to apply my Pen to so noble an end: being confident, that the very care, not to disgrace Your Majesties good pleasure, and indulgent choice of me, will invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate my weakness. But before I enter into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of others actions and fortunes (which require a free spirit) I must present at Your Royal feet, and even claim from Your natural equity and goodness, such compensation, (as it shall please You) in that which followeth.</p>
                     <p>I served the King Your Father of most blessed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, from the time he sent for me, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Raign, out of <hi>France,</hi> (retaining then some gracious remembrance of my service with him in <hi>Scotland)</hi> twenty years, that is, almost now a third part of my life, in ordinary and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary imployments abroad. I had many comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Letters of his contentment, or at least, of his gracious toleration of my poor endeavours: And I had under his own Royal hand, two hopes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version. The first, a moiety of a six Clerks place in <hi>Chancery.</hi> The next, of the Office of the <hi>Rolls</hi> it self. The first of these, I was forced to yield to Sir <hi>William Beecher,</hi> upon the late Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s former engagement unto him by promise,
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:102693:328"/>
even after Your Majesty had been pleased to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for me, with Your said ever blessed Father. And that was as much in value, as my Provostship were worth at a Market. The other of the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Rolls, I surrendred to the said Duke in the Gallery at <hi>Wallingford-</hi>House, upon his own very instant motion (the said Duke then intending it, upon the now Attorney, Sir <hi>Robert Heath)</hi> though with serious promise, upon his honour, that he would procure me some equivalent recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, before any other should be setled in the place.</p>
                     <p>The truth of my humble claim, and of his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere intentions towards me, I present herewith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Your Majesty, in a Letter all under his own hand.</p>
                     <p>I could likewise remember unto Your Majesty, the losses I have sustained abroad, by taking up moneys, for my urgent use, at more then twenty in the hundred; by casualty of fire, to the damage of near four hundred pounds in my particular; by the raising of moneys in <hi>Germany,</hi> whereby my small allowance (when I was sent to the Emperors Court) fell short five hundred pounds, as <hi>Seignor Burlamachi</hi> too well knoweth; and other wayes.</p>
                     <p>Now for all this (that I may not press Your Majesty with immoderate desires) I most humbly beg from Your Royal equity, and I may say, from Your very compassion, but two things: First, That Your Majesty will be pleased, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposing of the <hi>Rolls</hi> (to which I was assigned) to reserve for me some small proportion, towards the discharge of such debts as I contracted in publick service, yet remaining upon interest. Next, That You will be likewise pleased to promise me,
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:102693:329"/>
the next good Deanry, that shall be vacant by death or remove: whereof I also had a promise from Your blessed Father then at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and am now more capable thereof in my present condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And thus shall Your Majesty restore me, both to the freedom of my thoughts, and of my life; otherwise so intricated, that I know not how to unfold it. And so with my continual prayers to the Almighty, for his dearest and largest blessings upon Your Royal Person, I ever rest,</p>

The Parliament is, since your going, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by the King, upon such reason, as in good faith, all sober minds must approve, even while they wish it otherwise. Never was there such a morning, as that which occasioned the dissolution, since <hi>Phacton</hi> did guide his Fathers Chariot.</p>
                     <p>We are now cheared with some forraign news: but I am still sorry, that we must fetch our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from abroad, and from the discords of <hi>Italy,</hi>

instead of the harmony of <hi>England.</hi> Our Lords sit often, and vvere never more close: insomuch as it is as hard to get any thing out of the Counsel-Chamber, as out of the Exchequer.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> is suddenly sent Extraordinary Ambassador to the <hi>Hague;</hi> vvith the more vvonder, because Sir <hi>Robert Carr</hi> is yet there, <hi>omni par negotio.</hi> The others having been Cofferer, breeds some conjecture that the business is pecuniary. Nothing is yet done about the <hi>Rolls,</hi> and those other places in sequence: And my Lord of <hi>Bristow</hi>'s re entry into the Court (vvho the last vveek carried the Sword before the King) filleth us vvith new dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, as if he should be restored to the Vice-Chamberlainship, vvhich yet lyeth amortized in your Noble Friend.</p>
                     <p>Mine own businesses stand as they did: And the best is, they are rather stationary then retrograde.

                     <p>WE have newly concluded our Anniversary business, which hath been the most distracted Election that I verily believe had ever before been seen, since this Nurse first gave Milk, through no less then four recommendatory, and one mandatory Letter from the King himself; besides intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and messengers from divers great Personages for Boys both in and out, enough to make us think our selves shortly Electors of the Empire, if it hold on.

This Letter Mr. <hi>Avery</hi> carried to <hi>Croydon</hi> with paternal Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Hast, and brought us back an Answer to this substance; That though his Grace should be heartily willing in respect of the Fathers relation to her Majesty of <hi>Bohemia</hi> (as I had represented him) to do any thing for the Child: yet being a binding Precedent against Custome he could not suddenly determine the Point, being at that time without Civil Lawyers, by whose advice his Court was guided: And therefore if we would defer our Election till <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> he would then orderly decide it. But we being by other Statutes bound not to prolong our Election an hour after such a time as was already near spent, and to tell you <hi>in Sinu,</hi> being loth to leave our selves so long upon Interpretation, we gave it over. I understand since a circumstance that must needs trouble Mr. <hi>Avery</hi> more then the Business it self: That it failed by his fault, and not the Boyes. For after our Usher (the Childs Tutor) had instructed him, That by no means he should confess his forraign Birth, his Father, whom the Boy had not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his Tutors Instruction, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Statutes, bade his Son answer, when he should be asked the last Question, That he was born <hi>in Comitatu Hollandiae;</hi> and so the Child trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Father more then his Tutor, fell through the Basket.</p>
                     <p>With this Story I have entertained you at large, because, besides my zeal towards any thing that our Royal Mistress can wish to be done, I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
