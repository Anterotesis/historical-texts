            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing collected theſe briefe notes (Right Honourable, Right Worſhipfull, and my moſt reſpected) concerning the Succeſſe of Times (in moſt of the Kingdoms tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the World) euen from the Creation, to this inſtant yeare 1611. and modelled them all in this ſlender Volume, that ſuch as fauour Reuerend Antiquity, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue both pleaſure &amp; profit thereby: I thought
<pb facs="tcp:13283:3"/>
it part of my duty (in regard of ſome fauour and reſpect lately by mee receiued) to preſent your Honor and Worſhips there-with, as a token of my gratitude, and as a promiſe of my vttermoſt imployment, in theſe, or any other endeuours, whereto my meanneſſe in ability by you ſhall be commaunded. I know right well, and ſuch as know me, haue heard me daily confeſſe it, that I (of infinite others) was the moſt vnmeeteſt to vndergoe ſuch a ſerious buſineſſe, which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if not the beſt able, yet thoſe that therein are much better ſeene then my ſelfe. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, importunitie of Friendes, that greeue to ſee no willing hand put to the plough, or at leaſt ſuch (euen like my ſelfe) more forward then wiſe; their perſwaſions, I ſay, and ſome regard had of the times neceſſity, euery man beeing borne for the good of his Country; hath (vnder your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable and Worſhipfull fauour) made me thus aduenturous.</p>
            <p>Concerning the helpes I haue had in this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious trauaile, the Authors themſelues, who haue beſt written, and diſcourſed of thoſe ſeueral Kingdoms and Nations; euen them, &amp; no other haue I herein followed, borrowing beſide ſome ſuch matters from them, as (to my knowledge) haue not in any of our Chronicles heeretofore bin remembred, or at the leaſt, not plainly reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
<pb facs="tcp:13283:3"/>
In our home affaires, eſpecially the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this famous Cittie, I haue (with others) deliuered my opinion therin, yet ſwaruing from ſome, who haue beene thought ouer-ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, ſometime ſtraining at a Gnat, yet very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwallowing a Camell. The Dignitie that your Honor holdeth, of Lord Maior of this Cittie, and thoſe graue Senators, the Alder-men your Brethren, I haue aymed at the Original &amp; Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie thereof; ſome Authors tearming them <hi>Domeſmen, Eldermen,</hi> or <hi>Iudges</hi> of the Kinges Court. But that the name of Alderman decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth both verie Reuerend Originall, and great Antiquitie; I find recorded, that in the time of King <hi>Eadgar,</hi> one <hi>Ailwin,</hi> a man of the bloud Royall, and, for the ſpeciall great authority and fauour hee had with the King (being Sir-named <hi>Healf-Koning,</hi> that is, <hi>Half-King</hi>) was Alderman of all England, who founded that famous Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie in the Iſle of <hi>Ely.</hi> Our learned and worthy Antiquary M. <hi>Camden,</hi> hath obſerued the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph engrauen on his Tombe, containing theſe wordes: <hi>Hic requieſcit Ailwinus incliti Regis Ead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gari Cognatus, totius Angliae Aldermannus, et huius ſacri Coenobij miraculoſus fundator. Heere resteth Ailwin, Cozin to the Noble King Eadgar, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of al England, and of this holie Abbey the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Founder.</hi> Whereby appeareth, that the
<pb facs="tcp:13283:4"/>
Title of Alderman, in thoſe ancient, reuerend, and reſpectiue times, was an addition of honor and high repute, as diſtinguiſhing them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued that grace, to be men of greater, grauer, and more ſollide iudgment, in matters appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Weale-publique, then others, vnca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſuch eſpeciall dignity. Of ſuch worthy Fathers hath this famous Cittie beene plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully furniſhed from time to time, as in our Chronicle may more at large appeare, and to you thoſe graue Senators and worthily ſtyled Aldermen (out of intire and dutifull affection) haue I conſecrated the liuing memorie of theſe my poore labours: wiſhing to you all vnfeig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, that as heauen hath beſtowed this earthly honor vpon you, ſo (hereafter) it may crowne you with neuer dying happineſſe.</p>

Theſe Brethren (by ſolemne profeſſion) were bound to ſerue Pilgrims, and poore

people in the Hoſpitall of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> at Ieruſalem, and to ſecure (by their man-hood) their paſſages thither, they charitably buried the dead, were continually in praier, mortifyed themſelues with Watchings and Faſtinges, were courteous and kinde to the poore, whom they called their Maiſters, and fed them with white Bread, when themſelues did eate browne. They grew to be loued and liked of all ſortes, and, through the liberal bounty of good Princes and priuate perſons (admiring their piety and proweſſe) they roſe from this low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, to ſo high an eſtate and great riches, that about An. 1240. they had within Chriſtendome nineteene thouſand Lordſhips or Mannors, as the Knights <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers</hi> had nine thouſand, the Reuennewes and Rentes wherof in England, fell afterward alſo to theſe knights <hi>Hoſpitallers</hi> of S. <hi>Iohn Baptist.</hi> And this eſtate of theirs (growne to ſo great an height) made way for them likewiſe to as great honors.

Beeing <hi>Tailors</hi> of the Linnen-Armory, and brethren of Saint <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> (as moſt Companies, in thoſe times, had a Saintes appellation) they grew to be great in Kinges fauours, who thought it no indignity to themſelues, to be ſtiled in the Brother-hood of S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and from theyr Guildes firſt Creation by King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, with authority to hold a feaſt yearely at Midſommer, and to make choyce of a Gouernor or Mayſter (according to the order of a Great Maiſter, among the Knights <hi>Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitallers,</hi> of Saint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt of Hieruſalem</hi>) and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, to aſſiſt and ayde him in that weighty charge: they proceeded on ſtill (by the enſuing Kings) in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther additions of gracious regard, till King <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſeauenth confirmed their Charter, naming them <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-Taylors,</hi> of the Brother-hood of Saint <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi> to continue ſtill the memorie of their Originall.

            <p>Sir <hi>William Fitz William</hi> the elder, being a Merchant Taylor, and Seruaunt ſometime to Cardinall <hi>Wolſey,</hi> was choſen Alderman of Bread-ſtreet-Ward in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, in Anno. 1506. And going afterward to dwell at <hi>Mylton</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire</hi>; in the fal of the Cardinall his former Maiſter, he gaue him kinde entertainement there at his houſe in the Countrey. For which deede, being called before the King, and demaunded how he durſt entertaine ſo great an enemy to the State: his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere was, that he had not contemptuouſly or wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done it, but onely becauſe he had been his Maiſter, and partly the meanes of his greateſt Fortunes. The
<pb facs="tcp:13283:6"/>
King was ſo well pleaſed with his anſwer, that, ſaying, himſelfe had too few ſuch Seruaunts; immediatly hee knighted him, and afterward made him a priuy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celler.

            <p>Sir <hi>Thomas White,</hi> Lord Maior of this honourable Citty, and a worthy Brother likewiſe of that Society, beeing a louer of Learning, and an earneſt furtherer thereof; firſt purchaſed the Hall in <hi>Oxenford,</hi> called <hi>Glocester-Hall,</hi> for Students and Schollers to receiue there the benefit of learning. But his priuate thoughts very often ſolliciting him, that he ſhould (in time) meet with a place where two Elmes grewe, and that there his further forward purpoſe ſhould take effect: At length he found out the place, where (at his owne coſt and expences) hee founded the famous Colledge in <hi>Oxenford,</hi> called Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> Colledge, &amp; where thoſe two Elmes (as I haue heard) are yet ſtanding, endowing it with ſuch liberall Guifts, Lands, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uennewes, as would require too much time here to be remembred.

Twelue poore Inhabitants of that Citty, were to haue in free Almes twenty foure poundes, each man forty ſhillings yearely, on the eleauenth day of March. Four young men were alſo to haue fortie poundes yearely, ten pound each man, and for nine yeares ſpace, vpon ſufficient ſecurity giuen; And their turnes thus ſerued, then foure other young men to haue the like ſumme, and like limitation, and ſo from nine yeares, to nine yeares, for euer. Afterward it was ordred to two poore men of the ſame Citty, and laſtly to one; in which nature (according to the ſeuerall limitations) it doth yet, and doubtleſſe ſhall for euer continue.

He pacified the difference which <hi>Luitprand</hi> k. of the <hi>Lombards</hi> had with king <hi>Aribert,</hi> and made friendſhip with them both: As well by his authority, as by armes. He brought the rebellious <hi>Aequilius</hi> vnder obedience, encreaſed the Citties cuſtomes and reuennewes, and dyed, hauing bin Duke xx. yeares, vi. months, and viij. daies.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Marcello Tegaliano,</hi> of the ſame place of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> was elected his ſucceſſour, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon voyce of the people. Hee was deuoute,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:13283:147"/>
modeſt and affable, but much leſſe diligent in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning, then his predeceſſor. The Patriarchat of <hi>Grada</hi> was tranſ-ferred into <hi>Aquileia</hi> in hys time, by <hi>Luitprand,</hi> and there he had great wars about the diſſentions of the Byſhops, whereinto he would not interpoſe himſelfe, but died, hauing bin Duke nine yeares, and xxi. dayes.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Orſo Hipato,</hi> a Noble-man of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> woon himſelfe great Reputation by his famous déedes. <hi>Paulo</hi> the <hi>Exarcho</hi> had recourſe to him, the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army being broken, and ſiedge laid to <hi>Rauenna</hi> by <hi>Luitprand.</hi> He regained <hi>Rauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> made the Kings Nephew his priſoner, ſlewe the Duke of <hi>Vicenza,</hi> and reſeated the <hi>Exarcho</hi> in his due rights.

            <p n="5">5 <hi>Galla de Malamocco,</hi> a wicked and ſeditious man, yet ſhewing himſelfe as Protector of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace, he was eſtabliſhed in the place of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odato.</hi> But his wickedneſſe being knowne, and

that (being but a ſubiect) he would néedes make himſelfe abſolute Lord, hauing before ſlaine his chiefe Maiſter <hi>Theodato</hi>: the people pluckt out his eies, and tooke from him the dignity, which he had a yeare vſurped.</p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>Dominico Monegario,</hi> of <hi>Malamocco,</hi> was ſeated in the ſted of <hi>Galla.</hi> Somewhat to bridle his Dukes authority, the people ioined two year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Tribunes with him. But he, being a man au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious and arrogant, ſought to tiranize ouer the people: whereat they growing into fury, pluckt out his eies, the 8. yeare of his Principality.</p>
            <p n="7">7 <hi>Mauritio Galbaio,</hi> a Noble <hi>Heraclean,</hi> for his Iuſtice, wiſedome, and wealth, was choſen to this dignity.

And it is worth note, that of theſe thrée brethren, <hi>Beato</hi> is onely placed in the rank of Dukes in the Counſell chamber of <hi>Venice,</hi> where as <hi>Obelerio</hi> incited <hi>Pepin</hi> king of <hi>Italy,</hi> to make war on the <hi>Venetians:</hi> and <hi>Beato</hi> maintained the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth raigning 5. years.</p>

            <p n="13">13 <hi>Giouanni Participatio</hi> remained in the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie, &amp; inlarged the Church of <hi>S.

            <p n="13">13 <hi>Pietro Tradonico</hi> of <hi>Pola,</hi> hauing carryed himſelfe to the peoples contentment in the wars againſt <hi>Pepin,</hi> was elected duke.

            <p n="16">16 <hi>Pietro Candiano,</hi> was elected after the voluntarie diſmiſſion of his Predeceſſour.

            </p>
            <p n="17">17 <hi>Pietro Tribuno,</hi> Sonne of <hi>Dominico,</hi> was elected Duke.

            <p n="25">25 <hi>Tribuno Memo,</hi> was very rich, but no man of State.
