         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:165002:4"/>
of providence (being nothing but an <hi>entrance</hi> into the

ſhall I at <hi>preſent</hi> add any thing thereabout, but onely
my <hi>deſire</hi> that it may be eyed as the <hi>granted Baſis</hi> of the

of the making out thoſe <hi>thoughts,</hi> which were the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
<hi>conception,</hi> and like <hi>Jonah's Gourd,</hi> the <hi>child of a
night or two</hi> (which with prayer for a <hi>rooting</hi> in the
hearts of them to whom they were delivered, had certainly
<hi>withered,</hi> in their owne <hi>Leaves,</hi> had they not received
<hi>warmth</hi> and <hi>moyſture</hi> from your <hi>commands</hi> in general,
and the particular <hi>deſires</hi> of many of you, to give them a
<hi>life</hi> of a few dayes longer) I am encouraged to the <hi>annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of a few lines, as a free-will offering to attend the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Product of obedience.</p>
            <p>Now this ſhall not be to the <hi>Oppoſition</hi> which you doe
and ſhall yet further meet withall, but as to the <hi>Cauſes,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
or pretended, which are held forth as the <hi>bottom</hi> of that
contradiction wherwith on every ſide you are encompaſſed.</p>
            <p>The things in reference whereunto, your <hi>proceedence</hi>
is laden with ſuch <hi>criminations,</hi> as theſe ſad dayes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
have found to be <hi>Comets</hi> portending no leſſe
then <hi>blood,</hi> are firſt <hi>Civill,</hi> then <hi>Religious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> as their being beyond the bounds of my
<hi>Calling,</hi> gives them <hi>Sanctuary</hi> from being called forth
to my <hi>conſideration,</hi> ſo neither have I the leaſt thoughts
with <hi>Abſolom</hi> of a more orderly carrying of of <hi>Affaires,</hi>
might my <hi>deſires</hi> have any influence into their diſpoſall.
<hi>Waiting</hi> at the throne of Grace, that <hi>thoſe</hi> whom God
hath <hi>intruſted</hi> with, and <hi>enabled</hi> for the Tranſaction of
theſe things, may be <hi>directed</hi> and <hi>ſupported</hi> in their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
is the utmoſt of my undertaking herein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:165002:5"/>
For the other, or <hi>Religious things,</hi> the generall intereſt I have in
them as a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> being improved by the ſuper-added Title of a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of the Goſpel</hi> (though unworthy the one Name, and the other)
gives me not onely ſuch <hi>boldneſſe</hi> as accreweth from enjoyed <hi>Favour,</hi>
but alſo ſuch a <hi>Right</hi> as will ſupport mee to <hi>plead</hi> concerning them,
before the moſt <hi>Impartiall Judicature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this I ſhall <hi>doe</hi> (as I ſaid before) meerly in reference to thoſe
<hi>criminations,</hi> which are layd by <hi>conjecturall preſumptions</hi> on your
Honourable Aſſembly, and made a <hi>cauſe</hi> of much of that <hi>oppoſition</hi>
and <hi>contradiction</hi> you meet withall. Now in particular, it is the
<hi>Toleration of all Religions</hi> or invented wayes of worſhip, wherein
your <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> are confidently <hi>Antidated</hi> in many places of the
Nation, the <hi>thing it ſelfe</hi> withall, being held out, as the moſt <hi>enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
apprehenſion,</hi> and <hi>deſperate</hi> indeavour for the deſtruction of
<hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Godlineſſe</hi> that ever entred the <hi>thoughts</hi> of men, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the one and the other. The conteſt hereabout, being <hi>adhuc ſub
Judice,</hi> and there being no doubt, but that the whole <hi>matter,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<hi>phraſed</hi> as above, hath (like other things) ſinfull and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<hi>Extreames.</hi> I deemed it not amiſſe, to endeavour the powring
a <hi>little cold water</hi> upon the <hi>common flames,</hi> which are <hi>kindled</hi> in
the breaſts of men about this thing. And who knowes, whether the
words of a weake <hi>Nothing,</hi> may not by the power of the <hi>Fountaine
of Beings,</hi> give ſome <hi>light</hi> into the determination and <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi>
of a thing of ſo great concernment and conſequence, as this is

            <head>A Sermon Preached to the Honourable
Houſe of Commons, Jan. 31. 1648.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JEREMIAH 15. Ver. 19, 20.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>—Let them returne to thee, but returne not thou
unto them.</p>
                  <p>And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brazen
wall, and they ſhall fight againſt thee, but they ſhall
not prevaile againſt thee: for I am with thee to ſave
thee, and to deliver thee, ſaith the Lord.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE words of my <hi>Text</hi> having a full
dependance upon, and flowing out
from, the maine ſubject matter of the
whole <hi>Chapter;</hi> I muſt of neceſſity
take a view thereof, and hold out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you the minde of God contained
therein, before I enter upon the part
thereof chiefly intended: And this I
ſhall doe with very briefe Obſervations, that I may not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
my ſelfe, from a full <hi>opening and applycation</hi> of the
words of my <hi>Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>this</hi> the rather are my thoughts led unto, becauſe the
whole Tranſaction of things between the Lord and a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornely
ſinfull Nation, exceedingly accommodated to the
carrying on of the controverſie, he is now pleading with
that wherein wee live, is ſet out (as wee ſay) to the <hi>life</hi>
therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of the whole Chapter, there be theſe five parts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The denuntiation of fearefull waſting, deſtroying, judgements
againſt <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> v. 3. <hi>and ſo on to the</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:165002:6"/>
2. The procuring deſerving cauſe of theſe overwhelming cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
<hi>verſ. 4. and</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>3. The inevitableneſſe of thoſe judgements, and the inexorable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Lord, as to the accompliſhment of all the evill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>The ſtate and condition of the Prophet,</hi> with the frame
and deportment of his ſpirit, under thoſe bitter diſpenſations
of providence, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. and 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>5. The Anſwer and appearance of God unto him upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
out of his complaint, <hi>verſ. 11, 12, 13, 14. and</hi> 19, 20,
21.</p>
            <p>My <hi>Text</hi> lyeth in the laſt part, but yet with ſuch depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on the former, as inforceth to a conſideration of
them.</p>
            <p>1. There is the denuntiation of fearfull waſting deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Judgements</hi> to ſinfull <hi>Jeruſalem, verſ.</hi> 2. and ſo onwards,
with ſome interpoſed ejaculations, concerning her inevitable
ruine, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here's</hi> death, ſword, famine, captivity, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. baniſhment, <hi>v.</hi>
4. unpittied deſolation, <hi>v.</hi> 5. redoubled deſtruction, bereaving, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
ſpoyling, <hi>&amp;c. v.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
            <p>That univerſall devaſtation of the whole people, which
came upon them in the <hi>Babiloniſh</hi> Captivity, is the thing here
intended; The meanes of its accompliſhment by particuler
Plagues and Judgements, in their ſeverall kinds (for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dread and terrour) being at large annumerate: The
<hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> of God alſo being made hereby to ſhine more
cleare, in the <hi>diſperſion</hi> of that people; doing, not onely for
the maine, what before he had threatned, but in particular,
executing the Judgements recorded; <hi>Luke</hi> 26. 14. &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi>
28. 15. &amp;c. <hi>Fulfilling hereby what he had deviſed, accompliſhing
the word he had commanded in the dayes of old,</hi> Lam. 2. 17.</p>
            <p>That which hence I ſhall obſerve is onely from the <hi>variety</hi>
of theſe particulars, which are held out as the meanes of the
intended Deſolation.</p>
            <p>Gods treaſures of wrath againſt a ſinfull people,<note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> have ſundry and
various iſſues for the accompliſhment of the appointed end.</p>
            <p>When God <hi>walkes contrary</hi> to a people, it is not alwayes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:165002:6"/>
in <hi>one path, he hath ſeven wayes to doe it, and will doe it ſeven
times, Levit.</hi> 26. 24. He ſtrikes not alwayes with one weapon,
nor in one place. As there is with him <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>manifold
and various Grace, 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 10. Love and compaſſion making
out it ſelfe in choice variety, ſuited to our manifold indigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
So there is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Rom. 2. 5. Stored, treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
wrath,</hi> ſuiting it ſelfe in its flowings out, to the <hi>provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of ſtubborne ſinners.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Embleme</hi> of Gods wrath againſt man, was a <hi>fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Sword turning it ſelfe every way, Gen. 3. laſt:</hi> Not onely in
one, or two, but in <hi>all</hi> their paths, he meeteth them with his
<hi>flaming Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a wilde beaſt in a Net,<note place="margin">Iſa. 51. 20.</note> 
               <hi>ſo are ſinners under inexorable
judgements; the more they ſtrive, the more they are enwrapt,
and entangled. They ſhuffle themſelves from under one cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and fall into another;</hi> As if a man did flee from a Lyon,
and a Beare mett him; or went into the houſe and leaned his hand
upon the wall, and a Serpent bit him, Amos 5. 19. <hi>Oh remove
this one</hi> Plague,<note place="margin">Exod. 10. 17.</note> 
               <hi>ſaith</hi> Pharoah; <hi>if hee can eſcape from under
this preſſure, he thinkes he ſhall be free: but,</hi> When he fled from
the Lyon, ſtill the Beare met him, and when he went into the houſe,
the Serpent bit him.</p>
            <p>And as the flaming Sword turnes every way, ſo God can
put it into every thing: To thoſe that cry, <hi>Give me a King,</hi>
God can <hi>give him in his anger;</hi> and from thoſe, that cry, <hi>take
him away,</hi> hee can take him away in his wrath, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.
10, 11.</p>
            <p>Oh, that this might <hi>ſeale up inſtruction</hi> to our owne ſoules;
What <hi>variety</hi> of calamities have we beene exerciſed withall,
for ſundry yeares? What <hi>Pharoah-like</hi> ſpirits have we had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them? Oh that we were delivered this once, and then all
were well! How doe we ſpend all our thoughts to extricate
our ſelves from our preſent preſſures? If this hedge, this pit
were paſſed, wee ſhould have ſmooth ground to walke
in! not conſidering that God can fill our ſafeſt pathes with
Snares and Serpents: <hi>Give</hi> us peace, <hi>give</hi> us wealth, <hi>give</hi> us,
as we were, with our owne, in quietneſſe. Poore creatures!
ſuppoſe all theſe deſires were in ſincerity, and not as with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:165002:7"/>
the moſt they are, faire colours of ſoule and bloody deſignes;
yet if Peace were, and Wealth were, and former things were,
and God were not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what would it availe you? Cannot he
<hi>Poyſon</hi> your Peace, and <hi>Canker</hi> your Wealth? And <hi>When you
were eſcaped out of the field from the Lyon and the Beare, appoint
a Serpent to bite you, leaning upon the wals of your owne houſe?</hi> In
vaine doe you ſeek to ſtop the ſtreames, while the Fountaines
are open; turne your ſelves whither you will, bring your
ſelves into what condition you can, nothing but peace and
reconciliation with the God of all theſe judgements, can give
you reſt in the day of Viſitation: You ſee what Variety of
Plagues are in his hand: Changing of condition will doe no
more to the avoiding of them, then a Sick mans turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
from one ſide of the bed to another; during his turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
he forgets his paine by ſtriving to move, being laid down
againe, he findes his condition the ſame as before; this is the
<hi>firſt thing,</hi> we are under various judgements, from which by
our ſelves there is no deliverance.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing here expreſt,<note place="margin">2.</note> is the procuring cauſe of
theſe various Judgements ſet downe, <hi>v.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>—becauſe of Manaſſeh ſonne of Hezekiah King of Judah,
for that which he did in Jeruſalem.</p>
            <p>The ſinnes of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> filled the <hi>Epha</hi> of <hi>Judahs</hi> wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,<note place="margin">Zach. 5. 7.</note>
and cauſed the <hi>Talent</hi> of Lead to be laid on the mouth
thereof. Oftentimes in the relation of his ſtory, doth the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt</hi> emphatically expreſſe this; that, <hi>For his ſinne Judah
ſhould ſurely be deſtroyed, 2 Kings</hi> 21. 11. Yea when they had a
little reviving under <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and the bowels of the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to worke in compaſſion towards them; yet as it were,
remembring the provocation of this <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> he recals his
thoughts of mercy,<note place="margin">Eſt quaedam aemulatio di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinae rei, &amp; humanae, <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tul. Ap.</hi>
               </note> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. 26, 27. The diſpoſing of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and humane things, is oftentimes very opoſite. God
himſelfe proceeds with them in a diverſe diſpenſation: In the
ſpirituall body the <hi>members</hi> offend and the <hi>head</hi> is puniſhed:
<hi>The iniquity of us all did meet on him, Iſa.</hi> 53. In the civill po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick
body, the <hi>head</hi> offends and the <hi>members</hi> rue it; <hi>Manaſſeh</hi>
ſins, and <hi>Judah</hi> muſt goe Captive.</p>
            <p>Three things preſent themſelves for the Vindication of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:165002:7"/>
equity of Gods righteous judgments, in the recompencing the
ſins of the King upon the people.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Concurrence and Influence</hi> of the Peoples power into
their Rule and Government: They that ſet him up, may juſtly
be called to anſwer for his miſcarriage. The Lord himſelfe
had before made the ſole bottom of that <hi>Politicall Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
to be their owne wills. <hi>If thou wilt have a King after the
manner of the Nation,</hi> Deut. 17. 14. 1 Sam. 8. 7. though for
particulars, himſelfe (according to his ſupreame ſoveraignty)
placed in <hi>many,</hi> by peculiar exemption, otherwiſe his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
was ſerved by their plenary conſent, or by ſuch diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of things as you have related, 1 <hi>Kings 16. 21, 22. Then
were the people of Iſrael divided into two parts, halfe of the people
followed Tibni the ſonne of Ginath to make him King, and halfe
followed Omri: but the people that followed Omri prevailed againſt
the people that followed Tibni; ſo Tibni dyed, and Omri reigned.</hi>
Now they, who place men in authority to be <hi>Gods Vicegerents</hi>
doe undertake to God for their deportment in that authority,
and therefore may juſtly beare the ſad effects of their ſinfull
miſcarriages.</p>
            <p>2 Becauſe for feare <hi>of</hi> Manaſſe's <hi>cruelty,</hi> or to flatter him
in his tyranny for their owne advantage, the greateſt part of
the people had <hi>apoſtatized</hi> from the wayes and worſhip of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi>
to comply with him in his ſinne. As at another time
<hi>they willingly walked after the Commandement,</hi> Hoſ. 5. 11. And
this is plainly expreſt, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 9. Manaſſeh <hi>ſeduced the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to doe more evil then the Nations.</hi> When Kings turne ſeducers,
they ſeldome want good ſtore of followers: Now <hi>if the blinde
leade the blinde, both will,</hi> and both juſtly may <hi>fall into the
ditch.</hi> When Kings command unrighteous things, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſuite them with willing complyance, none doubts, but the
deſtruction of them both is juſt and righteous. See <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. of
this Chapter.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe the people by vertue of their retained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
did not reſtraine him in his provoking wayes. So
<hi>Zwinglius, Artic. 42. Qui non vetat, cum poteſt, jubet:</hi> When
<hi>Saul</hi> would have put <hi>Jonathan</hi> to death, the people would not
ſuffer him ſo to doe, but delivered <hi>Jonathan</hi> that he dyed not,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:165002:8"/>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. When <hi>David</hi> purpoſed the reducing of the Arke,
his ſpeech to the people was; <hi>If it pleaſe you, let us ſend abroad
to our brethren every where, that they may aſſemble themſelves to us,
and all the Congregation ſaid that they would doe ſo, because the
thing was right in their eyes,</hi> 2 Chron. 13. 2. So they bargaine
with <hi>Rehoboam</hi> about their <hi>ſubjection,</hi> upon condition of a
moderate <hi>Rule, 1 Kings</hi> 12. By vertue of which power alſo
they delivered <hi>Jeremiah</hi> from the Prophets and Prieſts that
would have put him to death, <hi>Ier.</hi> 26. 16. And on this ground
might juſtly feed on the fruit of their own neglected duty. See
<hi>Bilſon</hi> of Obed. <hi>part 3. page</hi> 271.</p>
            <p>Be it thus, or otherwiſe, by what way ſoever the people
had their <hi>Intereſt</hi> therein; certaine it is, that for the ſinnes of
<hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> one way or other, made their owne, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed:
And therefore theſe things being written for our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
it cannot but be of great concernment to us, to know
what were thoſe ſinnes which wrapt up the people of God in
irrevocable deſtruction: Now theſe the holy Ghoſt fully
manifeſteth in the ſtory of the life and reign of this <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi>
and they may all be reduced unto 2. chiefe heads.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Falſe worſhip or ſuperſtition:</hi> He built high places, made
Altars for <hi>Baal,</hi> and a Grove as did <hi>Ahab,</hi> 2 Kings 25. 2.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Cruelty:</hi> Hee ſhedde innocent blood very much, till hee had
filled Jeruſalem with blood from one end of it to another, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>Whether this <hi>cruelty</hi> be to be aſcribed to his <hi>Tyranny</hi> in civill
affaires, and ſo the blood ſhed, is called <hi>innocent,</hi> becauſe
not of Malefactors, or to his <hi>perſecution,</hi> in ſubordination to
his <hi>falſe worſhip</hi> inſtituted as before (as the Pope and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
have devoured whole Nations <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia</hi>)
is not apparent:<note place="margin">See the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix at the end of this Sermon.</note> but this is from hence and other places moſt
evident; That <hi>ſuperſtition and perſecution, will-worſhip and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
are inſeparable concomitants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſets up his great Image, and the next news
you heare, <hi>the Saints are in the furnace,</hi> Dan. 3. 20. You ſeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome
ſee a fabricke of <hi>humane invented worſhip,</hi> but either the
foundation or top-ſtone is laid in the blood of Gods people.
<hi>The wiſdome</hi> (Religion, or way of worſhip) <hi>that is from above,
is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſie to be entreated, full of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:165002:8"/>
mercy and good fruits, without partiality, without hypocriſie,</hi>
James 3. 17. when the other is <hi>earthly, ſenſuall, devilliſh, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
along envying, ſtrife, contention, and every evill worke,</hi>
verſ. 16. Perſecution and blood is the genuine product of all
invented worſhip. I might from hence name, and purſue other
<hi>Obſervations,</hi> but I ſhall only name one, and proceed.</p>
            <p>When falſe worſhip with injuſtice by cruelty have poſſeſſed the
Governours of a Nation,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> and wrapt in the conſent of the greateſt
part of the people; who have been acquainted with the mind of God,
that People and Nation without unpreſidented mercy is obnoxious to
remedileſſe ruine.</p>
            <p>Thoſe two are the <hi>Bell</hi> and <hi>Dragon,</hi> that what by their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctings,
what by their deſervings, have ſwallowed that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
of blood which hath flowed from the veines of millions
of millions ſlaine upon the face of the earth. Give mee the
number of <hi>the witneſſes of Jeſus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 6. 9, 10.</note> whoſe ſoules under the Altar
cry for revenge againſt their falſe worſhipping murtherers,
and the Tale of them, whoſe lives have been ſacrificed to the
inſatiable <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> of blood-thirſty Potentates,
with the iſſues of Gods juſt vengeance on the ſons of men, for
complyance in theſe two things, and you will have gathered
in the whole <hi>Harveſt of blood,</hi> leaving but a few ſtragling glea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
upon other occaſions. And if theſe things have
been ſound in <hi>England,</hi> and the preſent adminiſtration with
ſincere humiliation, doe not runne croſſe to <hi>vnravell this cloſe
woven webb</hi> of deſtruction, all thoughts of recovery will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be too late. And thus far, ſinne and providence drive on a
parallel.</p>
            <p>3. The inevitableneſſe of the deſolation threatned, and the
inexorableneſſe of God in the execution of it, <hi>v.</hi> 1. is the third
thing conſiderable: <hi>Though</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Samuel <hi>ſtood before mee,
yet my minde could not be toward this people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Should I inſiſt upon this, it would draw me out unto Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
evidences, of a Nations <hi>travelling in ſinne,</hi> beyond the
line of Gods patience, and ſo not to be exempted from ruine:
but inſtead thereof I ſhall make it a part of my daily ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that they may be to our <hi>enemies,</hi> if <hi>Gods</hi> enemies, and
the interpretation of them to thoſe that hate us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:165002:9"/>
In briefe, the words containe an impoſſible <hi>ſuppoſition,</hi> and
yet a <hi>Negation</hi> of the thing for whoſe ſake it is ſuppoſed: <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
and <hi>Samuel</hi> were men, who in the dayes of their fleſh offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up ſtrong ſupplications, and averted many imminent
judgements from a ſinfull people; As if the Lord ſhould ſay,
All that I can doe in ſuch a caſe as this, I would grant at the
interceſſion of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> or others interceding in
their ſpirit and zeale; but now the ſtate of things is come to
that paſſe, the time of Treaty being expired, the black flagge
hung out, and the <hi>decrree having brought forth,</hi> Zeph. 2. 2.
that upon their utmoſt intreaty it cannot, it ſhall not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is a time when ſin growes ripe for ruine;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
               <hi>For three tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
and for foure the Lord will not turne away the iniquity of a
people,</hi> Amos 1. 9. When the <hi>ſinne of the Amorites</hi> hath <hi>filled</hi>
the cup of vengeance, they muſt drinke it, <hi>Gen. 15. 16. Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
under ſeverall Adminiſtrations of civill Government,
hath fallen <hi>twice:</hi> yea <hi>thrice</hi> into Nation-deſtroying ſinnes;
Providence hath once more given it another bottome; If you
ſhould ſtumble (which the Lord avere) at the ſame blocke of
impiety and cruelty, there is not another ſifting to be made
to reſerve any graines from the ground; I doubt not but our
three tranſgreſſions and foure will end in totall deſolation,
the Lord be your guide, poor <hi>England</hi> lyeth at ſtake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The greateſt difficulty that lyeth in bringing of totall deſtruction

            <p>Now this returne may be conſidered two wayes.</p>

               <item>2. In reference to his deportment: I have neither borrowed nor
lent on uſury yet they curſe me.</item>

            <p>From the First, Obſerve:</p>

            <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> had brought the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
by that wonderfull and unparallel'd deliverance, being
forced to appeare with the Lord for the deſtruction of <hi>Corah</hi>

againſt him and Aaron, laying murther and ſedition to their

workes doe not ſuite with the <hi>luſts, prejudices,</hi> and <hi>intereſts</hi> of

            <p>2. You have the Prophets deportment, and the frame of

            <p>

               <hi>Gods choiſeſt

How weary was <hi>David</hi> when he cryed out in ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>O that I had wings like a Dove, for then would I flie away
and be at reſt, Pſal.</hi> 55. 6. Long had he waited for a deſired
<hi>iſſue</hi> of his perplexed ſtate, and had perhaps often times been
fruſtrated of his <hi>hope</hi> of drawing to a period of his miſeries,
and now finding one <hi>diſappointment</hi> to follow on the neck of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:165002:10"/>
another, he is weary and cries, What nothing, but this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and confuſion ſtill? <hi>Oh that I had wings like a Dove,</hi> a
Ship to ſaile to a forraigne Nation (or the like) there to be
at peace. In the like ſtrait another time, ſee what a miſerable
concluſion he draws, of all his being exerciſed under the hand
of God, <hi>Pſal. 73. 13. Verily I have clenſed my heart in VAINE,
and wiſhed my hands in innocency;</hi> And againe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 11.
He ſaith in the perturbation of his mind, <hi>All men are lyars:</hi>
That all the promiſes, all the encouragements, which in his

            <p>It is not with <hi>them,</hi> as it was with that <hi>wicked King of Iſrael,</hi>
who being diſappointed of peace and del<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ctation;</hi> therefore he quite throweth off the
Lord and his protection. Not unlike many among our ſelves,
whoſe deſires and expectations being not ſatisfied in the <hi>cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of our diſtractions, according to the way, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
had framed for the Lord to walke in, are ready to caſt
off his <hi>cauſe,</hi> his protection to comply with the enemies of
his Name, <hi>Si Deus homini non placuerit, Deus non erit:</hi> But it
may be obſerved, that deliverance came not to that people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<hi>Jehoram</hi> was weary of waiting, and then inſtantly God
gives it in; when God hath tyred the <hi>patience</hi> of corrupted
men, he will ſpeak <hi>peace</hi> to them, that wait for him.</p>
            <p>Thus is it not with the Saints of God, onely being <hi>perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
in their ſpirits, <hi>darke</hi> in their apprehenſions, and <hi>fainting</hi>
in their ſtrength, they breake out oft times into paſſionate
complaints (as <hi>Jeremy</hi> for a Cottage in the Wilderneſſe) but
yet for the maine holding firme to the Lord: and the reaſons
of this quailing are:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The weakneſſe of Faith, when the methods of God's proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are unfath mable to our apprehenſions;</hi> while men ſee the
paths wherein the Lord walketh, they can follow him through
ſome difficulties; but when that is hid from them, though
Providence ſo ſhut up all other wayes, that it is impoſſible
God ſhould be in them, yet if they cannot diſcerne (<hi>ſo proud
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:165002:11"/>
are they</hi>) how he goeth in that wherein he is, they are ready
to faint and give over. God is pleaſed ſometime to make
darkneſſe his pavilion and his ſecret place, <hi>A fire devoures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and it is very tempeſtuous round about him, Pſal.</hi> 50. 3.
When once God is attended with fire, darkneſſe, and tempeſt,
becauſe we cannot ſo eaſily ſee him, we are ready to leave him:
Now this the Lord uſually doth in the execution of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>Thy righteouſneſſe is like the great Mountaines, thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are a great deep, Pſal.</hi> 36. 6. His <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is like a great <hi>Mountaine,</hi> that is eaſie to be ſeen, a man
cannot overlooke it, unleſſe he wilfully ſhut his eyes; <hi>But his
Judgements are like the great Deepe;</hi> Who can look into the
bottome of the <hi>Sea,</hi> or know what is done in the depths there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
Gods works in their <hi>accompliſhment</hi> are oftentimes ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited
to the reaſons and apprehenſions of men, that very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
who have been ſtrong in deſires, and great in expectation
of them, upon their bringing forth to light, have quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
and oppoſed them as none of his, becauſe diſtant from
what they had framed to themſelves: It is evident from the
Goſpel, that the people of the <hi>Jewes</hi> were full of expectation
and longing for the great work of the comming of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias,</hi>
juſt at the ſeaſon wherein he came, yet being come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
not <hi>accommodated</hi> to their <hi>prae imaginations,</hi> they reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, <hi>as having neither forme nor comelineſſe in him to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
Iſa.</hi> 53. 2. And the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> telleth many, <hi>Who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
the day of the Lord, that, that day ſhould be darkneſſe to them
and not light, Amos</hi> 5. 18, 20. So in every Generation many
deſirers of the accompliſhment of Gods work, are ſhaken off
from any ſhare therein, by finding it unſuited to their reaſons
and expectations.</p>
            <p>Now when the Lord is pleaſed thus to <hi>walke in darkneſſe,</hi>
many being not able to <hi>trace</hi> him in his diſpenſations, are
ready to lye downe and ſink under the burden: <hi>David</hi> ſeemes
to profeſſe, that he had nothing at ſuch a time to uphold him
but this, that God muſt be there, or no where; <hi>I had ſaid</hi>
(ſaith he) <hi>that it was in vaine to walke as I doe, but that I
ſhould have condemned the generation of thy Children, Pſal.</hi> 73. 15.
And truely God never leaves us without to much <hi>light,</hi> but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:165002:11"/>
that we may ſee clearly <hi>where he is not,</hi> and ſo by recounting
particulars we may be rolled <hi>where he is,</hi> though his goings
there be not ſo clear. Aske if God be in the Counſels of men,
who ſeek themſelves, and in the ways of thoſe who make it
their deſigne to ruine the Generation of the juſt. If you finde
him there, ſeek no further; if not, let that give you <hi>light,</hi> to
diſcerne, <hi>where hee makes his abode, that you turne not aſide to
the flocks of Others.</hi>

Princes in <hi>Germany</hi> againſt <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>fift, Luther</hi> himſelfe
for a ſeaſon was bewildred, and knew not what to doe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till

Chriſt askes, <hi>If when becomes, hee ſhall finde faith on the earth,
Luke</hi> 18. 8. It is his comming with the <hi>ſpirit of judgement and

Now what Faith ſhall he want, which will not be found in
that day? Not the Faith of <hi>adherence</hi> to himſelfe for ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
life and juſtification, but of <hi>actuall cloſing</hi> with him in the
things he then doth; that ſhall be rare, many ſhall be ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and faint in that day.</p>
            <p>And thus by the ſeverall Heads of this Chapter, have I
led you through the very ſtate and condition of this Nation
at this Time.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Variety of judgements</hi> are threatned to us, and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on us, as in the firſt part. Secondly, of theſe, <hi>Falſew or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
Superſtition, Tyranny, and Cruelty</hi> lye in the bottome, as
their procuring cauſes, which is the ſecond. Thirdly, Theſe
<hi>if renewed under your hand,</hi> will certainely bring inevitable

ruine upon the whole Nation, which is the third. Fourthly,
<hi>All which, make many precious Hearts, what for want of light,
what for want of Faith, to faile, and cry out,</hi> for the wings of a
Dove, which is the fourth. I come in the fift place to Gods
direction to you for the future, in this ſtate and condition,
which being ſpread in diverſe Verſes as the Lord gives it to the
Prophet, I ſhall meddle with no more of it, then is contained
in the words, which at our entrance I read unto you.</p>
            <p>Let them returne, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words obſerve foure things,</p>
            <p>1. Gods <hi>direction</hi> to the Prophet, and in him, to all, that
doe his worke in ſuch a ſeaſon, as this deſcribe<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: <hi>Let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to thee, returne not thou to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Their aſſiſtance and ſupportment in purſuance of that
direction:</hi> I will make thee, to this people, a brazen fenced wall.</p>
            <p>3. The oppoſition, with its ſucceſſe and iſſue, which in
that way, they ſhould meet withall: <hi>They ſhall fight againſt
thee, and ſhall not prevaile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Their Conſolation and ſucceſſe from the preſence of the
Lord: <hi>For I am with thee to deliver thee, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. There is Gods direction,</p>
            <p>Many difficulties in this troubleſome ſeaſon, was the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
intricated withall: The <hi>people</hi> would not be <hi>prevailed</hi>
with, to come up to the mind of God, they continuing in
their <hi>ſtubbornneſſe,</hi> the Lord would not be <hi>prevailed</hi> with, to
avert the threatned Deſolation; what now ſhall he doe? To
ſtand out againſt the <hi>bnlke of the people</hi> ſuits not his earthly
Intereſt; to couple with them, anſwers not the diſcharge of
his Office; to wait upon them any longer, is fruitleſſe; to
give up himſelfe to their ways comfortleſſe: Hence his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
hence his moanings. Better lye downe and ſink under
the burden, then always to ſwim againſt the ſtreame of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformable
multitude: In this ſtrait, the Lord comes in with
his direction, <hi>Let them returne unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. Keep thy ſtation,
performe thy duty, comply not with the <hi>Children of Backſly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</hi>
But what ever be the <hi>eſſue,</hi> if there be any <hi>cloſing</hi> wrought,
let it be, by working them off from their wayes of Folly. <hi>All
condeſcention</hi> on thy part, where the worke of God is to be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:165002:12"/>
done is in oppoſition to him; If they <hi>Return,</hi> embrace them
freely; if not, doe thy <hi>duty conſtantly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which is ſpoken immediately to the Prophet, I ſhall
hold out to All, Acting in the name and Authority of God, in
this generall Propoſition.</p>
            <p>Plauſible complyances of men in Authority,<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> with thoſe, againſt
whom they are employed, are Treacherous contrivances againſt the
God of Heaven, by whom they are employed.</p>
            <p>If God be ſo provoked, that he curſeth him, <hi>who doth his
worke negligently,</hi> what is he by them that do it Treacherouſly?
when he gives a <hi>ſword</hi> into the hands of men, and they thruſt
it into his owne <hi>Bowels,</hi> his Glory and Honour, thoſe things
ſo deare to him? He that is intruſted with it, and dares not
doe <hi>Juſtice</hi> on every one, that dares doe <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> is affraid of
the creature, but makes very bold with the Creator.</p>
            <p>Prov. 25. 2. <hi>It is the glory of God to conceale a thing, but it is
the glory of a King to finde out a matter:</hi> That which God aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be <hi>glorious</hi> in, to manifeſt his <hi>Attributes</hi> by, is <hi>the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing
and covering our Iniquities</hi> in Chriſt; but if the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi>
will have glory, if he will not bring upon himſelfe
<hi>Diſhonour</hi> by diſhonouring of God, he is to ſearch and finde
out the <hi>Tranſgreſſions,</hi> with whoſe Cognizance he is entruſted,
and to give unto them condigne Retribution. If the Lord
curſe them, <hi>who come not forth to his helpe againſt the mighty,</hi>
Judg. 5. 23. What is their due, who being called forth by
him, doe yet <hi>helpe the mighty againſt him?</hi> For a man to take
part with the <hi>Kingdomes Enemies</hi> is no ſmall crime; but for a
<hi>Commisſion-Officer</hi> to runne from them by whom he is <hi>Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionated,</hi>
to take part with the Adverſary, is death without
mercy: yet have not ſome in our dayes arrived at that ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
<hi>Impudence,</hi> that when as private perſons they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
againſt the <hi>Enemies</hi> of the Nation, and by that means
got themſelves into <hi>Authority,</hi> they have made uſe of that
<hi>Authority</hi> to comply with, and uphold thoſe, by an <hi>Oppoſition</hi>
to whom, they got into their Authority? which is no leſſe then
an <hi>Atheiſticall</hi> attempt to perſonate the Almighty, unto ſuch
Iniquities as without his Appearance, they dare not owne:
But <hi>he that juſtifieth the wicked, and condemneth the Juſt, are both
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:165002:13"/>
an Abhomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 17. 15. and not only to the
Lord, but to good men alſo; <hi>He that ſaith to the wicked, thou
art Righteous, him ſhall the people curſe, Nations ſhall abhor him,</hi>
Prov. 24. 24.</p>
            <p>I ſpeake only as to the Generall (for mee let all particulers
find mercy) with <hi>a ſad Remembrance</hi> of the late workings of
things amongſt us, with thoſe vile ſordid <hi>compliances</hi> which
grew upon the ſpirits of <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> with thoſe,
whoſe Garments were died with the blood of Gods Saints
and precious ones (as formerly they were called, for now
theſe Names are become termes of reproach) and would this
<hi>complying</hi> went alone, but Pretences and Accuſations muſt be
found out againſt ſuch as fellow with them, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to call <hi>darkeneſſe light,</hi> they will ere long call <hi>light darkneſs:</hi>
by which meanes, our eyes have ſeen, men of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
laying down the <hi>weapons</hi> werewith at firſt they fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Oppoſers, and taking up <hi>them,</hi> which were uſed againſt
themſelves, as hath happened more then once, to <hi>Pen-men</hi>
both in our own, and our neighbour Nation. Now this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting
from principles of Religion and Righteouſneſſe, to a
complyance with any ſinfull way or perſon, is a Treacherous
Oppoſition to the God of Heaven; for,</p>
            <p>1. It cannot be done but by preferring the <hi>creature</hi> before
the <hi>Creator,</hi> eſpecially in thoſe things which are the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
cauſes of Deviation.</p>
            <p>Two principall cauſes I have obſerved of this crooked wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
            <p>1. Feare.</p>
            <p>2. That Deſire of periſhing things, which hath a mixture
of <hi>Covetouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>Ambition.</hi> The firſt maketh men <hi>wary,</hi>
what they doe againſt men, the other maketh them <hi>weary</hi> of
doing any thing for God, as whereby their ſordid ends are
not like to be accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>1. Feare: when once Magiſtrates begin to liſten after <hi>quid
ſequitur's,</hi> and ſo to with-draw from <hi>doing good,</hi> for <hi>Feare</hi> of
ſuffering <hi>evill,</hi> paths of wickedneſs are quickly returned unto,
and the authority of God deſpiſed. <hi>Let this man goe, and take
heed of Caeſar,</hi> John 19. 12. did more prevaile on <hi>Pilat's</hi> trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:165002:13"/>
heart, then all the other clamours of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> yea,
was not the whole <hi>Sanedrim</hi> ſwayed to deſperate villany, <hi>for
feare the Romans ſhould come and take away their Kingdome?</hi>
John 11. 48. When men begin once to diſtruſt that God will
leave them in the bryars, to wreſtle it out themſelves (for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe
lyeth at the bottome of carnall feare) they quickely
turne themſelves to <hi>contrivances</hi> of their owne, for their owne
<hi>ſafety,</hi> their owne <hi>proſperity,</hi> which commonly is by <hi>obliging</hi>
thoſe unto them by <hi>compliances,</hi> in an oppoſition to whom
they might <hi>oblige</hi> the Almighty to their aſſiſtance: ſurely they
conclude hee wants either <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> to ſupport them in
his employment.</p>
            <p>If a <hi>Prince</hi> ſhould ſend an Embaſſadour to a <hi>Forreigne</hi> State
to treat about Peace, or to denounce War; who, when hee
comes there, diſtruſting his Maſters <hi>Power</hi> to make good his
undertaking, ſhould <hi>comply</hi> and winde up his <hi>Intereſt</hi> with
them to whom he was ſent, ſuffering his Soveraign<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> errant to
fall to the ground, would hee not be eſteemed as arrant a
Traitor as ever lived? And yet though this be <hi>clipt coine</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, it is put upon the Lord every day as currant.</p>
            <p>From this principle of carnall feare and unbeliefe, <hi>trembling
for a man that ſhall dye, and the Son of man that ſhall be as graſſe,
forgetting the Lord our maker,</hi> Iſa. 51. 12. are all thoſe <hi>prudential
follies,</hi> which exerciſe the mindes of moſt men in authority,
making them, eſpecially in times of difficulties, to regulate
and ſquare all their proceedings, by what ſuites their owne
ſafety and particular intereſts, counſelling, adviſing, working
for themſelves, quite forgetting by whom they are entruſted,
and whoſe buſineſſe they ſhould doe.</p>
            <p>2. A deſire of periſhing things tempered with covetouſneſs
and ambition: Hence was the ſparing of the fat Cattell, and
of <hi>Agag</hi> by <hi>Saul,</hi> 1. Sam. 15. When thoſe two <hi>qualifications</hi>
cloſe on any, they are diametrally oppoſed to that frame
which of God is required in them, <hi>viz. That they ſhould be men
fearing God, and hating covetouſneſſe:</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> will goe far, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only a contrivance for ſafety; but if this <hi>latter</hi> take hold of
any, being a conſultation to <hi>exalt</hi> themſelves, it quickly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth
them beyond all bounds whatſoever. The Lord grant,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:165002:14"/>
that hereafter there may be no ſuch complaints in the <hi>Nation,</hi>
or may be cauſeleſſe, as have been heretofore, <hi>viz.</hi> That wee
have powred out our <hi>prayers,</hi> jeoparded our <hi>lives,</hi> waſted our
<hi>eſtates,</hi> ſpent our <hi>blood,</hi> to ſerve the <hi>luſts</hi> and compaſſe the deſigns
of ambitious ungodly men.</p>
            <p>The many wayes whereby theſe things intrench upon the
ſpirits of men, to byaſſe them from the paths of the Lord, I
ſhall not inſiſt upon, it is enough that I have touched upon the
obvious cauſes of deviation, and manifeſted them to be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries
againſt the God of all Authority.</p>
            <p>Be exhorted to beware of <hi>Relapſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

inducements, and to be conſtant to the way of <hi>Righteouſneſſe,</hi>
and <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his I ſhall hold out unto you in two particulars.</p>
            <p>1. Labour to recover others, even all that were ever diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inguiſhed
and called by the name of the Lord, from their late
fearfull <hi>Returning</hi> to ſinfull <hi>Complyances</hi> with the Enemies of
God and the Nation: I ſpeak not of mens <hi>Perſons,</hi> but of their
<hi>wayes;</hi> For 3. yeares this people have been eminently <hi>ſicke</hi> of
the folly of <hi>Back<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſliding,</hi> and without ſome <hi>ſpeciall Cordiall</hi>
are like to periſh in it, as farre as I know.</p>
            <p>Looke upon the <hi>eſtate</hi> of this People as they were differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
ſeven yeares agoe, ſo for ſome continuance, and as they
are <hi>now,</hi> and you ſhall find in how many things we have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned</hi>
to others, and not one inſtance to be given of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to us; that this may be clear take ſome partciulars.</p>
            <p>1. In <hi>Words and Expreſſions,</hi> thoſe are <hi>index animi;</hi> turne
them over and you may find what is in the whole Heart. <hi>Out
of the Aboundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> Now is not
that <hi>Language,</hi> are not thoſe very <hi>Expresſions,</hi> which filled
the mouths of the common Adverſaries onely, grown alſo
terms of <hi>Reproach</hi> upon the Tongues of men, that ſuffered
ſometimes under them, and counted it their honour ſo to do?
Hence that common <hi>Exprobation,</hi> A Parliament of <hi>Saints,</hi> an
Army of <hi>Saints,</hi> and ſuch like D<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">

               </hi> Ah! had it not been more for <hi>the Honour</hi> of God,
that we had kept our ſtation, untill others had come to us, ſo
to have exalted the name and profeſſion of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> then
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:165002:14"/>
that we ſhould ſo return to them, as to joyne with them in
making the paths of Chriſt a Reproach? <hi>Had it not beene bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for us with Judah to continue Ruling with God, &amp; to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
with the Saints,</hi> Hoſ. 11. 12. <hi>then to ſtand in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the mockers, and to ſit in the ſeate of the ſcornefull?</hi> What
ſhall we ſay when the Saints of God <hi>are as ſignes and wonders to
be ſpoken againſt in Iſrael?</hi> Iſa. 8. 18. Oh that men would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
how they have <hi>left</hi> their firſt <hi>ſtation;</hi> when them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
uſe thoſe <hi>Reproaches</hi> unto others, which for the ſame
cauſe themſelves formerly bare with comfort! It is bitterneſſe
to conſider how the Goſpel is ſcandalized by this wofull <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi>
of Miniſters and People, by caſting <hi>Scripturall Expresſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
by way of ſcorn, on thoſe, with whom they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in the like kind Companions of Contempt. Surely in
this we are <hi>Returned</hi> to them, and not they to us.</p>
            <p>2. In Actions and thoſe,</p>
            <p>1. Of <hi>Religion,</hi> not only in <hi>Opinion,</hi> but <hi>Practiſe</hi> alſo, are we
here under a vile <hi>Returne.</hi> We are become the <hi>Lyons,</hi> and the
very ſame thoughts entertained by us, againſt others, as were
exerciſed towards our ſelves. Are not others as unworthy to
live upon their native ſoile in <hi>our judgements,</hi> as we our ſelves
in <hi>the judgements</hi> of them formerly over us? Are not <hi>groanes</hi>
for <hi>liberty,</hi> by the warmth of favour, in a few yeares hatched
into <hi>Attempts</hi> for <hi>Tyranny?</hi> and for <hi>Practiſe,</hi> what hold hath
former ſuperſtition in obſerving <hi>dayes</hi> and <hi>times,</hi> laid hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>the many of the People</hi> again, witneſs the late ſolemn ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
and many things of the like nature.</p>
            <p>2. For <hi>Civill things,</hi> the cloſing of ſo many, formerly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
engaged, with the adverſe party in the late <hi>Rebellion,</hi>
with the luke warm deportment of others at the ſame time, is
a ſufficient demonſtration of it; And may not the Lord juſtly
complain of all this, <hi>what iniquity have you ſeene in mee, or my
wayes, that you are gone farre from me, and walked after vanity,
and are become vaine,</hi> Jer. 2. 4. <hi>Why have you changed your glory
for that which doth not profit,</hi> verſ. 11. <hi>Have I beene a dry heath,
or a barren wilderneſſe to you?</hi> Oh that men ſhould find no more
ſweetneſs in following the <hi>Lambe</hi> under wonderfull protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but that they ſhould thus turne aſide into every Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:165002:15"/>
What <hi>Indignity</hi> is this to the wayes of God? I could
give you many <hi>Reaſons</hi> of it; but I have done, what I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
a little hinted, that wee are a <hi>Returning People,</hi> that ſo
you might be exhorted to help for a Recovery: and how ſhall
that be?</p>
            <p>2. By your owne <hi>keeping cloſe</hi> to the Paths of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
if you <hi>Returne</hi> not, others will look about again: This
Breach, this evill is of you, within your own walls, was
the fountaine of our <hi>Backeſliding.</hi> Would you be the <hi>Repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Breaches, the Reſtorers of Paths</hi> for men to walke in, doe
theſe two things.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Turne</hi> not to the wayes of ſuch, as the Lord hath blaſted
under your eyes, and theſe may be referred to 3. heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Oppresſion.</item>
               <item>2. Selfe-ſeeking.</item>
               <item>3. Contrivances for perſecution.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Oppresſion,</hi> how deteſtable a crime it is in the eyes of
the Almighty, what effects it hath upon men, <hi>making wiſe
men madde,</hi> Eccl. 7. 7. How frequently it cloſeth in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous
Ruine of the Oppreſſours themſelves, are things
known to all. Whether it hath not been exerciſed in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
both in <hi>Generall</hi> by unneceſſary Impoſitions, and in
<hi>Particular</hi> by unwarrantable preſſures, let the mournfull <hi>cryes</hi>
of all ſorts of People teſtifie. Should you now <hi>Return</hi> to ſuch
wayes as theſe, would not the Anger of the Lord ſmoake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
you? Make it I bſeech you your <hi>Deſigne</hi> to relieve the
whole, by all meanes poſſible, and to relieve Particulars, yea
even of the <hi>adverſe Party</hi> where too much overborn. Oh let it
be conſidered <hi>by you,</hi> that it be not conſidered <hi>upon you.</hi> I know
the things you are neceſſitated to, are not to be ſupported by
the aire. It is only what is <hi>unneceſſary</hi> as to you, or <hi>inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
as to othes, that requires your ſpeedy Reforming; that
ſo it may be ſaid of you as of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> Chap. 5. 14, 15. And
for <hi>Particulars</hi> (pray pardon my folly and boldneſs) I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſire a Committee of your Honourable Houſe might ſit
once a week, to relieve poor men that have been oppreſſed by
men, ſometimes enjoying Parliamentary Authority.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Selfe-ſeeking,</hi> when men can be content to lay a <hi>Nation
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:165002:15"/>
low,</hi> that they may <hi>ſet up</hi> themſelves upon the heapes and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines
thereof. Have not ſome ſought to advance themſelves
under that power, which with the lives and blood of the
People they have oppoſed? Seeming to be <hi>troubled</hi> at former
things, not becauſe they were <hi>done,</hi> but becauſe they were not
<hi>done by them.</hi> But <hi>innocent blood</hi> will be found a Tottering
foundation for men to build their Honours, Greatneſſe, and
Preferments upon. O <hi>returne</hi> not in this unto any. If men
<hi>ſerve themſelves</hi> of the Nation, they muſt expect that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will <hi>ſerve it ſelfe</hi> upon them. The beſt ſecurity you can
poſſibly have that the <hi>People</hi> will performe their duty in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
is the witneſſe of your own conſciences, that you have
diſcharged <hi>your duty</hi> towards them, in ſeeking <hi>their good, by
your owne trouble,</hi> and not <hi>your owne advantages</hi> in their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
I doubt not but that in this, your practice makes the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
a commendation, otherwiſe the word ſpoken, will
certainly witneſſe againſt you.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Contrivances for perſecution,</hi> how were the hearts of all
men hardned like the nether Mill-ſtone, and their thoughts
did grinde blood and revenge againſt their Brethren! What
colours, what pretences had men invented to prepare a way
for the <hi>Rolling of their garments in the teares:</hi> yea blood of
Chriſtians. The Lord ſo keep your ſpirits from a compliance
herein, that with all the Bowe be not too much bent on the
other ſide, which is not impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Be there a Backſliding upon your ſpirit to theſe, or ſuch
like things as theſe, the Lord will walke contrary to you,
and <hi>were you as the Signet upon his hand,</hi> he would pluck you
off.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Returne not to the open enemies of our peace:</hi> I could here
inlarge my ſelfe to ſupport your ſpirits in the work men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<hi>Job</hi> 29. 14, 15. but I muſt on to the following parts
of my Text, and paſſe from the <hi>Direction</hi> given, to the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,</hi>
and Aſſiſtance promiſed. <hi>I will make thee to this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
a brazen and a fenced Wall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An implyed <hi>Objection,</hi> which the Prophet might put in,
upon his charge to keep ſo cloſe to the rule of righteouſneſſe,
is here removed. If I muſt thus abide by it, to execute what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:165002:16"/>
the Lord cals me out unto, not ſhrinking, nor ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the greateſt undertakings, what will become of me in
the iſſue? Will it not be deſtructive to ſtand out againſt a
confirmed People? No, ſaith the Lord, it ſhall not be: <hi>I will
make thee, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>God will certainly give in prevailing ſtrength,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obſ.</note> 
               <hi>and unconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
defence unto Perſons conſtantly diſcharging the duties of
Righteouſneſſe, eſpecially when undertaken in times of difficulty
and oppoſition. I will make thee,</hi> &amp;c. The like engagement to
this you have, made to <hi>Ezekiel, Chap.</hi> 3, 8, 9. Neither was it
ſo to the <hi>Prophets</hi> alone, but to <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> alſo when <hi>Joſhua</hi>
undertook the Regency of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in a difficult time, he takes
of his feare and <hi>Diffidence</hi> with this very incouragement, <hi>Joſh.</hi>
1. 5. He ſaith he will make them a <hi>Wall,</hi> the beſt defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
oppoſition, and that not a weake <hi>tottering Wall,</hi> that
might eaſily be caſt downe, but a <hi>brazen wall,</hi> that muſt
needs be impregnable: What Engines can poſſibly prevaile
againſt a Wall of <hi>Braſſe?</hi> And to make it more ſecure, this
<hi>brazen wall</hi> ſhall be <hi>fenced</hi> with all manner of fortifications,
and ammunition; ſo that the verieſt Coward in the World,
being behind ſuch a <hi>wall,</hi> may without dread or terrour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
himſelfe to that, which he findeth to doe. God will ſo
<hi>ſecure</hi> the Inſtruments of his glory againſt a <hi>Backeſlyding peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
in holding up the wayes of his Truth and Righteouſneſſe,
that all <hi>Attempts</hi> againſt them ſhall be vaine, and the moſt ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
ſpirit may be ſecure, Provided he goe not out of the
Lords way; for if they be found beyond the <hi>Line,</hi> the <hi>brazen
wall,</hi> they may eaſily be ſurprized. And indeed, who but a
<hi>Foole</hi> would run from the ſhelter of a <hi>brazen wall,</hi> to hide
himſelfe in a <hi>little ſtubble?</hi> And yet ſo doe all who runne to
their owne wiſedome, from the moſt hazardous engagement
that any of the wayes of God can poſſibly lead them unto. It
is a ſure word, and for ever to be reſted upon, which the Lord
gives in to <hi>Aſa, 2 Chron. 15. 2. The Lord is with you, while yee
be with him:</hi> An <hi>unbiaſed Magiſtracy,</hi> ſhall never want Gods
continued preſence: Very <hi>Jeroboam</hi> himſelfe receives a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
upon condition of cloſe walking with God in righteous
adminiſtrations, of having <hi>an houſe built him like the houſe of

David, 1 Kings</hi> 11. 38. What a wall was God to <hi>Moſes</hi> in
that great undertaking of being inſtrumentall for the delivery
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from a bondage and ſlavery of foure hundred yeares
continuance: <hi>Pharoah</hi> was againſt him whom he had depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of his <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and dominion over the People: and
what a provocation the <hi>depriving of Soveraignty</hi> is unto Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates,
needs no demonſtration: To the <hi>corruption</hi> of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which inclines to <hi>Heights</hi> and exaltations, in imitation
of the fountaine whence is flowes; they have alſo the <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of ſtate and condition, which hath alwayes enclined to
Abſoluteneſſe and Tyranny: All <hi>Egypt</hi> was againſt him, as
being by him viſibly deſtroyed, waſted, ſpoyled, robbed, and
at length ſmitten in <hi>the Apple of the eye,</hi> by the loſſe of their
firſt borne; and if this be not enough, that the <hi>King</hi> and
People, whom he oppoſed were his enemies, the very People,
for whoſe ſakes he ſet himſele to oppoſe the others, they alſo
riſe up againſt him, yea ſeek to deſtroy him; one time they
<hi>appeale to God for Juſtice againſt him, Exod. 5. 21. The Lord
looke upon you and judge.</hi> They appeale to the righteous God
to witneſſe, that he had not fulfilled what he promiſed them,
to wit, Liberty, Safety, and freedome from oppreſſion, but
that rather by his meanes their Burdens were encreaſed: And
in this they were ſo confident (like ſome amongſt us) that
they <hi>appealed</hi> unto God for the equity of their complaints.
Afterward being reduced to a <hi>ſtrait,</hi> ſuch as they could not
ſee how poſſibly they ſhould be <hi>extricated</hi> from, without utter
<hi>ruine</hi> (like our preſent condition in the apprehenſion of ſome)
they cry out upon him for the whole deſigne of bringing them
into the Wilderneſſe, and affirme poſitively, that though they
had periſhed in their former ſlavery, it had been better for
them, then to have followed him in this new and dangerous
engagement,<note place="margin">Calv. in Num. Cap. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Ex.</hi> 14. 11, 12, 13. That <hi>Generation</hi> being (as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
obſerves) ſo inured to <hi>bondage,</hi> that they were altogether
unfit to beare with the <hi>workings</hi> and pangs of their <hi>approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Liberty.</hi> Afterwards, doe they want drink? <hi>Moſes</hi> is the
cauſe; did they want meate? this <hi>Moſes</hi> would ſtarve them,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 24. and 16. 7. He could not let them alone by the
Fleſh-pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> for this they are ready to ſtone him,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:165002:17"/>
               <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 3. At this day, have we too much <hi>Raine,</hi> or too
ſhort a <hi>Harveſt,</hi> it is laid on the ſhoulders of the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
It was no otherwiſe of old. At length this People
came to that height, as being frightened by the oppoſition,
they heard of, and framed to themſelves in that place whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Moſes</hi> would carry them, that they preſently enter into
a <hi>conſpiracy</hi> and <hi>revolt,</hi> conſulting to caſt off his Government,
and choſe new Commanders, and with a violent hand to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi>
to their former condition, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 4. an <hi>attempt</hi> as
frequent at fruitleſſe among our ſelves. When this would not
doe, at length upon the occaſion of taking off <hi>Corah</hi> and his
company, they aſſemble themſelves together, and lay (not
impriſonment but) <hi>murder</hi> to his charge, and <hi>that of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Lord, Numb.</hi> 16. 41. Now what was the iſſue of all
thoſe oppoſitions? What effect had they? How did the
power of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> the Revenge of <hi>Egipt,</hi> the backſliding of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> prevaile? Why God made this one <hi>Moſes</hi> a <hi>fenced bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
wall</hi> to them All, he was never in the leaſt meaſure prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
againſt; ſo long as he was with God, God was with him,
no matter who was againſt him.</p>
            <p>One thing onely would I commend to your conſiderations,
<hi>viz.</hi> That this <hi>Moſes,</hi> thus preſerved, thus delivered, thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,

            <p>1. Becauſe of his owne <hi>Engagement,</hi> and that is two fold,
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Of</hi> Truth and Fidelity.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Of</hi> Honour and Glory.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. His Truth and Veracity is ingaged in it. <hi>Thoſe that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him he will honour, 1 Sam.</hi> 2. 30. If men honour him
with <hi>Obedience,</hi> he will honour them with <hi>preſervation: He will
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:165002:17"/>
be with them while they are with him, 2 Chron.</hi> 15. 2. While
they are with him <hi>in conſtancy of duty,</hi> he will be with them to
keep them in ſafety, <hi>He will never leave them nor forſake them,
Joſh. 1. 5. No weapon that is framed againſt them ſhall proſper,
Iſa.</hi> 54. 17. Now God is never <hi>as the waters that faile</hi> to any
that upon his ingagements waite for him; he will not ſhame
the faces of them that put their truſt in him. Why ſhould <hi>our
unbeleeving ſpirits charge that upon the God of Truth, which wee
dare not impute to a man that is a worme, a lyar?</hi> Will a man
faile in his ingagement unto him, who upon that ingagement
undertakes a difficult imployment for his ſake? The truth is,
it is either want of ſincerity in our working, or want of
faith in dependance, that makes us at any time come
ſhort of the utmoſt tittle, that is in any of the Lords en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements.</p>
            <p>1. We want <hi>ſincerity,</hi> and doe the Lords work, but with our
owne <hi>aimes</hi> and ends, like <hi>Jehu;</hi> no wonder, if we be left to
our ſelves for <hi>our wages</hi> and defence.</p>
            <p>2. We want <hi>Faith</hi> alſo in the Lords worke, turne to our
owne <hi>counſels</hi> for ſupportment; no marvell, if we come ſhort
of aſſiſtance; <hi>If we will not beleeve we ſhall not be eſtabliſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Looke to <hi>ſinceritie</hi> in working, and <hi>faith</hi> in dependance,
Gods truth and fidelity will carry him out to give you incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable
ſupportment: Deflexion from theſe, will be your
deſtruction: You that are working on a new <hi>Bottome,</hi> worke
alſo on new <hi>principles,</hi> put not <hi>new Wine</hi> into <hi>old Bottles,</hi> new
deſignes into old Hearts.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is engaged in point of <hi>Honour,</hi> if they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry
in his way, <hi>What will he doe for his great name?</hi> Yea ſo
tender is the Lord herein of his Glory, that when he hath
been exceedingly provoked to remove men out of his preſence
yet becauſe they have been called by his <hi>Name,</hi> and have vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
held forth a following after <hi>him,</hi> he would not ſuffer
them to be trodden downe, left the enemy ſhould exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and ſay, <hi>Where is now their God?</hi> They ſhall not take
from him the <hi>honour</hi> of former Deliverances and protections:
In ſuch a Nation as this, if the Lord now upon manifold
provocations ſhould give up <hi>Parliament, People, Army</hi> to cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:165002:18"/>
and ruine, would not the <hi>Glory</hi> of former counſels, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,
deliverances, be utterly loſt? would not men ſay it was
not the Lord, <hi>but chance that happened to them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. For our <hi>Encouragement,</hi> the wayes of GOD are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
attended with ſo many <hi>difficulties,</hi> ſo much Oppoſition,
that they muſt be imbraced meerly becauſe his; no other <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
in the World can ſuit them to us. I meane for ſuch as
keep them immixed from their owne carnall and corrupt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts:
Now becauſe the Lord will not take off the <hi>hardſhip</hi>
and difficulty of them, leaſt he ſhould not have the <hi>Honour</hi> of
carrying on his work, againſt tumultuating oppoſition, hee
ſecures poore weaklings of comfortable <hi>aſſiſtance,</hi> and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>ſucceſſe,</hi> leſt his worke ſhould be wholy neglected. It is
true, the Lord as our ſoveraigne Maſter may juſtly require a
cloſe labouring in all his wayes, without the leaſt ſweetning
endearments put upon them, onely as they are his whoſe we
are, who hath a <hi>dominion</hi> over us: But yet as a a <hi>tender Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
in which relation he delights to exerciſe his will towards
his owne in Chriſt, <hi>Hee pittieth our infirmities, knowing that
we are but duſt:</hi> and therefore to invite us into the <hi>darke,</hi> into
ways labourſome and toyleſome to fleſh and blood, he gives
us in this ſecurity, that we ſhall be as <hi>a fenced brazen wall</hi> to
the oppoſing ſons of men.</p>
            <p>To diſcover the <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> of all oppoſition to men
called forth of God to doe his worke,<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe. 1.</note> and walking in his
wayes; would you not thinke him <hi>mad,</hi> that ſhould ſtrike
with his fiſt, and run with his head againſt a <hi>fenced brazen wall</hi>
to caſt it downe? Is he like to have any ſucceſſe, but the <hi>bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering</hi>
of his fleſh, and the <hi>beating</hi> out of his braines? What
doe the <hi>waves</hi> obtaine by daſhing themſelves with noiſe and
dread againſt a <hi>rocke,</hi> but their owne beating to peeces? What
prevailes a <hi>man</hi> by ſhooting his arrows againſt the <hi>Skie,</hi> but a
<hi>returne</hi> upon his owne head? Nor is the moſt powerfull op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to the ways of God, like to meet with better ſucceſſe:
God looks no otherwiſe upon Oppoſers, then you would do
upon a man attempting to thruſt downe <hi>a fenced brazen wall</hi>
with his fingers. Therefore it is ſaid, that in their <hi>proudeſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,</hi>
ſtrongeſt <hi>aſſaults,</hi> deepeſt <hi>counſels,</hi> combinations, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:165002:18"/>
aſſociations, <hi>he laughs them to ſcorne,</hi> derides their folly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns
their fury, lets them ſweat in <hi>vaine,</hi> untill their day
become, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. How birthleſſe in our <hi>owne,</hi> as other <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>
have been their ſwelling conceptions? What then is
it that prevailes upon men to break through ſo many diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments
againſt the Lord, as they doe? Doubtleſſe that
of <hi>Iſa. 23. 9. Surely the Lord of Hoſts hath a purpoſe to ſtaine
the pride of all glory, to bring into contempt all the honourable of
the earth.</hi> God <hi>gives up men</hi> unto it, that he may leave no
earthly glory or honour without pollution or contempt:
And therefore hath <hi>Oppoſition</hi> in our dayes, been turned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo many hands, that God might leave no glory without
contempt: Yet with this difference, that if the Lord will
owne them, he will recover them from their oppoſition, as
hath happened of late to the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of <hi>one,</hi> and will happen
ere long to the Miniſtry of <hi>another</hi> Nation; when the Lord
hath a little ſtain'd the pride of their glory; they ſhall bee
brought home againe by the <hi>ſpirit of judgement and burning:</hi>
but if he owne them not, they ſhall periſh under the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And when it hath been <hi>wheeled</hi> about on all ſorts of men,
the <hi>End</hi> will be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be wiſe now therefore O yee Rulers,</hi>

Behold, here is a way to encompaſſe <hi>England</hi> with a <hi>brazen

leave to inſiſt a little on one <hi>particular,</hi> which I chooſe out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
many others: When God leades out his people to any
great things, <hi>the Angel of his preſence</hi> is ſtill among them:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:165002:19"/>
ſee at large <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 20, 21, 22. The Angel of the Covenant,

ſpeciall Caution if we would have his Aſſiſtance, <hi>that we ſhould
beware of him, and obey him, and provoke him not:</hi> Would you
then have Gods Aſſiſtance continued, take heed of <hi>provoking
the Angel of his preſence:</hi> provoke him not by ſlighting of his
wayes, provoke him not by contemning his Ordinances; if
you leave him to deale for himſelfe,<note place="margin">See the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix about Tolleration.</note> he will leave you to ſhift
for your ſelves: what though his followers are at ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
(the beſt <hi>knowing but in part</hi>) about the Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſome things in his Kingdome; the <hi>Envious</hi> one having

are captivated by <hi>Sathan,</hi> the Prince of Pride, to a contempt
of all his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> whoſe ſoules I hope the Lord will one

(it is no time to conteſt, or diſpute it) to beare witneſſe in the

to all the Inhabitants of the Earth: and herein I do not ſpeak

peace attends the upright in the wayes of God. You that are

and he will make you a fenced brazen wall.</p>
            <p>And ſo I come to the third thing, which I propoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
the Oppoſition, which men cleaving to the Lord in all
his ways ſhal find, with the iſſue and ſucceſs of it, <hi>They ſhal fight

            </p>
            <p>The words may be conſidered either as a <hi>Prediction</hi> depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on Gods praeſcience, of <hi>what will be,</hi> or a <hi>Commination</hi>
from his juſt Judgement, of <hi>what ſhall be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt ſence the Lord tells the Prophet, from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
apoſtacy, ſtubbornneſſe of that People <hi>what would
come to paſſe.</hi> In the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, what for their ſins and provocations,
by his juſt judgement <hi>ſhould come to paſſe.</hi> Time will not allow
me to handle the words in both Acceptations: wherefore I
ſhall take up the <hi>latter</hi> only, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a Commination of
<hi>what ſhall be</hi> for the further miſery of that wretched People,
they ſhall <hi>Judicially</hi> be given up to a fighting againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God oftentimes gives up a ſinfull People to a fruitleſſe contention,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obſ.</note>
               <hi>and fighting with their only ſupporters, and meanes of deliverance.</hi>
They ſhall, &amp;c. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had laboured with God for them,
and with them for God, that if poſſible peace being made
they might be delivered, and to conſummate their ſins, <hi>they
are given up to fight againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot now inſiſt upon particular inſtances, conſult the
<hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in all Ages, you ſhall find it continually
upon all occaſions verified. From the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> oppoſing <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
to the <hi>Ephraimites</hi> conteſt with <hi>Jephte,</hi> the rejecting of
<hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſo on to the <hi>Kings</hi> of the earth, giving their
power to the <hi>Beaſt</hi> to wage Warre with the <hi>Lamb,</hi> with the
<hi>Inhabitants</hi> of the World combining againſt the <hi>witneſſes</hi> of
Chriſt, is this Aſſertion held out. In following ſtory, no
ſooner did any Plague or Judgement breake out againſt the
<hi>Roman Empire,</hi> but inſtantly, <hi>Chriſtianos ad Leones,</hi> their
fury muſt be ſpent upon them, who were the onely ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of it from irrecoverable ruine. Now the Lord doth
this,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:165002:20"/>
1. To <hi>Seale</hi> up a ſinfull Peoples deſtruction. <hi>Elie's</hi> Sonnes
hearkened not, becauſe the Lord would ſlay them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
2. 25. When God intends <hi>Ruine</hi> to a people, they ſhall walk
in wayes, that tend thereunto: Now is their a readier way
for a man to have a <hi>houſe</hi> on his head, then by <hi>pulling</hi> away
the <hi>Pillars</hi> whereby it is ſupported? If by <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtanding in
the <hi>Gap,</hi> the fury of the Lord be turned away, certainely if
the people contend to remove him, their deſolation ſleepeth
not. When therefore the Lord intends <hi>to lay Cities waſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Inhabitant, and houſes without men, to make a Land utterly
deſolate,</hi> the way of its accompliſhment is by <hi>making the hearts
of the People fat,</hi> and their eares heavy, and ſhutting <hi>their
eyes that they ſhould not ſee,</hi> and attend to the meanes of their
recovery, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 10, 11. So <hi>gathering in his peace and mercies
from a provoking people, Jer.</hi> 16. 15.</p>
            <p>2. To manifeſt his owne <hi>power and ſoveraignty</hi> in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a ſmall handfull, oftimes a few ſingle perſons, a <hi>Moſes,</hi>
a <hi>Samuel,</hi> two <hi>Witneſſes</hi> againſt the oppoſing rage of a hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
multitude. If thoſe who undertake his worke and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in their ſeverall <hi>Generations,</hi> ſhould have withall, the
concurrent obedience and aſſiſtance of others, whoſe <hi>good</hi> is
intended, neither would his <hi>name</hi> be ſo ſeen, nor his <hi>wayes</hi> ſo
honoured, as now, when he beares them up againſt all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
Had not the <hi>people</hi> of this Land been given up (many
of them) to fight againſt the Deliverers of the Nation, and
were it not ſo with them even at this time, how <hi>darke</hi> would
have been the workings of <hi>Providence,</hi> which now by wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
through all oppoſition are ſo conſpicuous and cleare.
When then a People, or any part of a people, have made
themſelves <hi>unworthy</hi> of the good things intended to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
by the Inſtruments of righteouſneſſe and peace,
the Lord will <hi>blow</hi> upon their <hi>waves,</hi> that with rage and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
they ſhall daſh themſelves againſt <hi>them,</hi> whom he will
ſtrengthen with the <hi>munition of Rocks,</hi> not to be prevailed
againſt. So that <hi>Gods glory</hi> and their <hi>owne ruine,</hi> lye at the
bottome of this cloſe working of providence, in giving up a
<hi>ſinfull People</hi> to a <hi>fruitleſſe contending,</hi> with their owne Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
if ever they be delivered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:165002:20"/>
But is not a Peoples contending with the Inſtruments,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> by
whom God worketh amongſt them, and for them, a ſin and
provocation to the eyes of his glory? How then can the Lord
be ſaid to give them up unto it?</p>
            <p>Avoyding all <hi>Scholaſticall diſcourſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> as unſuited to the work

of their guilt, or colour for <hi>charge</hi> on the juſtice and
goodneſſe of God.</p>
            <p>1. Then to <hi>give up men</hi> unto a thing in it ſelfe ſinfull, is no
more, but ſo to diſpoſe and order things, that <hi>ſinners</hi> may
exerciſe and draw out their <hi>ſinfull principles,</hi> in ſuch a way.
This that the Lord doth, the Scripture is full of <hi>examples,</hi> and
hath Teſtimonies innumerable: That herein the <hi>Holy one of

can ſay unto him, what doeſt thou, Job 9. 12. Shall the thing

Rom. 9. 20. <hi>And hence two things will follow.</hi>

               <hi>and being in it ſelfe,</hi> for he workes as the Fountaine of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
<hi>This</hi> ſin hath not. So that though every <hi>action,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good or bad, receives its <hi>ſpecification</hi> from the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Providence, and to that, is their <hi>exiſtence</hi> in their

and Accidents.</p>
            <p>But now the <hi>Principle of operation</hi> in man, is <hi>Nature</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
and corrupted: I ſay <hi>Nature,</hi> not that he worketh <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,</hi>
being a <hi>free Agent,</hi> but that theſe faculties, <hi>will</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi>
which are the principles of Operation are in
<hi>nature</hi> corrupted, and from thence can nothing flow but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill:
<hi>An evill tree bringeth forth evill fruit: Men doe not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Figs from Thiſtles: A bitter fountaine ſends not forth ſweet
Waters: Who can bring a cleane thing out of an uncleane?</hi> If
the <hi>fountaine</hi> be poiſoned, can the <hi>ſtreames</hi> be wholeſome?
What can you expect of light and truth from a minde
poſſeſt with vanity and darkneſſe? What from a will
averted from the <hi>chiefeſt good,</hi> and fixt upon <hi>preſent appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?</hi>
What from an heart, the figment of whoſe imagination
is onely evill?</p>
            <p>2. Conſider the difference in the <hi>Rule of operation:</hi> Every
thing that workes hath a <hi>Rule</hi> worke by, this is called a
<hi>Law.</hi> In <hi>that thing</hi> which <hi>to man</hi> is ſinfull, God worketh as
it is a <hi>thing</hi> onely, Man as it is a <hi>ſinfull thing:</hi> And how ſo?
Why every ones ſin is his Aberration from his Rule of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
or working. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

not to collime aright at the end propoſed; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
is a moſt exact definition of it: <hi>Irregularity is its forme,</hi>
if it may be ſaid to have a Forme: a Privations forme, is
deformity. Looke then in any Action, wherein an <hi>Agent</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitates
from its <hi>Rule,</hi> that is ſin: Now what is Gods rule
in operation? <hi>His owne infinite wiſe will alone;</hi> he takes
neither Motive, riſe, nor occaſion for any internall acts, from
any thing without himſelfe; <hi>hee doth what ever hee pleaſeth,
Pſal. 115. 3. He worketh all things according to the counſell of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:165002:21"/>
his owne will, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 11. That is his owne <hi>Law</hi> of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and the <hi>Rule</hi> of righteouſneſſe unto others: working
then agreeably to his owne will, which he alwayes muſt doe,
he is <hi>free</hi> from the obliquity of any action. What now is the
<hi>Rule</hi> of the Sonnes of men? Why the revealed will of God;
<hi>Revealed things belong to us that we may doe them, Deut.</hi> 29. 29.
Gods <hi>revealed will</hi> is the rule of our walking; our working;
what ever <hi>ſuits</hi> not, anſwers not this, is <hi>Evill.</hi> Sinne is the
tranſgreſſion of the Law, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 4. Here then comes in the
<hi>deformity,</hi> the obliquity, the <hi>at axy</hi> of any thing, God workes
and man worketh; thoſe <hi>Agents,</hi> have ſeverall rules. God
workes according to his <hi>rule,</hi> hence the action is good, as an
Action: Man deviates from his <hi>rule,</hi> hence it is <hi>ſinfull</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of its qualifications and Adjuncts. Man writes <hi>faire</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
upon a wet paper, and they run all into one blot, not
the <hi>skill</hi> of the Scribe, but the <hi>defect</hi> in the Paper is the cauſe
of the deformity: he that makes a <hi>lame Horſe</hi> goe, is the cauſe
of his going, but the defect in his joynts, is the cauſe of his
going lame: The <hi>Sunne</hi> exhales a ſteame from the <hi>Dunghill,</hi>
the <hi>Sunne</hi> is the cauſe of the exhalation, but the <hi>Dunghill</hi> of
the unwholeſome ſavour. The firſt cauſe is the proper cauſe
of a <hi>things being,</hi> but the ſecond of its <hi>being Evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Conſider the <hi>ſeverall operations and actings of God and
Man:</hi> for inſtance in a rebellious peoples fighting againſt their
Helpers under him.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Acts</hi> of God herein may be referred to ſix heads.</p>
            <p>1. A continuance <hi>of the creatures being and life;</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pholding
him by the word of his power, Heb. 1. 3. <hi>When he might take
him off in a moment:</hi> Enduring them with much long ſuffering,
Rom. 9. 22. <hi>When he might cut him off as he did she oppoſers
of</hi> Elijah, with fire from heaven, 2 Kings 1. 12.</p>
            <p>2. A <hi>continuance of power of operation to them,</hi> when he
could <hi>make their hands to wither like Jeroboams,</hi> when they goe
about to ſtrike, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 4. Or their hearts, to dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
them like <hi>Nabals,</hi> when they intend to be Churliſh, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
25. 37. but he raiſeth them up, or <hi>makes them to ſtand,</hi> that
they may oppoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Laying before them a ſuitable object for the drawing forth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:165002:22"/>
their corruption unto oppoſition,</hi> giving them ſuch Helpers as
ſhall in many things croſſe their luſts, exaſperate them,
thereunto; as <hi>Elijab</hi> a man of fiery zeale, for a lukewarme
<hi>Ahab.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Withholding from them that effectuall grace,</hi> by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
that ſin might be avoided; a not actually keeping them
from that ſin by the might of his ſpirit and grace; that alone
is effectuall grace, which is actuall; <hi>he ſuffers them to walke in
their owne wayes:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this the Lord may doe,</p>
            <p>Firſt, in reſpect of them, <hi>Judicially,</hi> they deſerve to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken,
<hi>Ahab</hi> is left to fill up the meaſure of his iniquities, <hi>add
iniquity to iniquity, Pſal.</hi> 69. 27.</p>
            <p>Secondly, In reſpect of himſelfe, by way of <hi>Soveraignety,</hi>
doing what he will with his owne, <hi>hardening whom hee will,
Rom.</hi> 9. 15.</p>
            <p>5. He poſitively ſends upon their <hi>underſtandings</hi> that, which
the Scripture ſets out under the termes of <hi>blindneſſe, darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
folly, deluſion, ſlumber, a ſpirit of giddineſſe,</hi> and the like;
the places are too many to rehearſe. What <hi>ſecret actings</hi> in,
and upon the <hi>minds</hi> of men, what <hi>diſturbing</hi> of their adviſes,
what <hi>mingling</hi> of corrupt affections with falſe carnall reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
what givings up to the power of darkneſſe, in <hi>Satan</hi>
the Prince thereof, this <hi>judiciall act</hi> doth containe, I cannot
inſiſt upon: Let it ſuffice, God will not helpe them, to diſcern,
yea he will cauſe <hi>that they ſhall not</hi> diſcerne but hide from
their eyes the things that concerne their peace, and ſo give
them up to contend with their onely Helpers.</p>
            <p>6. Suitably, upon the <hi>will and affections</hi> he hath ſeverall
acts; obfirming the one, in corruption, and giving up the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to vileneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 24, 26. Untill the <hi>heart</hi> become
throughly hardened, and the <hi>conſcience</hi> ſeared: Not <hi>forcing</hi>
the one, but leaving it to follow the Judgement of practicall
reaſon, which being a <hi>blind,</hi> yea a <hi>blinded</hi> guide, whither can
it lead a <hi>blind</hi> Follower, but into the ditch? Not <hi>defiling</hi> the
<hi>other</hi> with infuſed <hi>ſenſuality,</hi> but provoking them to <hi>act</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to inbred, native corruption, and by ſuffering frequent
vile actings to confirme them in wayes of vileneſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:165002:22"/>
Take an inſtance of the whole; God gives Helpers and
Deliverers to a ſinfull people, becauſe of their provocations,
ſome or all of them ſhall not taſte of the Deliverance, by them
to be procured; wherefore though he ſuſtaines their <hi>lives</hi> in
being, whereby they might have opportunity to know his
minde, and their owne peace, yet he gives them a <hi>power</hi> to
contend with their <hi>Helpers,</hi> cauſing their helpers to act <hi>ſuch
things,</hi> as under conſideration of circumſtances, ſhall excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
provoke theſes ſinners: Being ſo <hi>exaſperated</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked,
the Lord who is free in all his diſpenſations, refuſeth
to make out to them that <hi>healing grace,</hi> whereby they might
be kept from a ſinfull oppoſition: Yea being juſtly <hi>provoked,</hi>
and reſolved that they ſhall not taſte of the plenty to come,
he makes them <hi>fooliſh and giddy</hi> in their reaſonings and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
blinds them in their <hi>underſtandings,</hi> that they ſhall not
be able to diſcerne <hi>plaine and evident things,</hi> tending to their
owne good, but in all their wayes, ſhall <hi>erre like a drunken
man in his vomit;</hi> whence that they may not be recovered,
becauſe he will deſtroy them, he gives in hardneſſe and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
upon their hearts and ſpirits, leaving them to <hi>ſuitable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi>
to contend for their owne ruine.</p>
            <p>Now what are the <hi>wayes and methods</hi> of ſinfull mans work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in ſuch an <hi>oppoſition,</hi> would be too long for me to declare;
what <hi>prejudices</hi> are erected, what <hi>luſts</hi> purſued, what cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<hi>Intereſts</hi> acted, and followed; how <hi>ſelfe</hi> is honoured,
what falſe <hi>pretences</hi> coyned, how <hi>God</hi> is ſleighted, if I ſhould
goe about to lay open, I muſt looke into the <hi>Hell</hi> of theſe
times, then which nothing can be more loathſome and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable:
Let it ſuffice, that ſinfull <hi>ſelfe,</hi> ſinfull <hi>luſts,</hi> ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<hi>prejudices,</hi> ſinfull <hi>blindneſſe,</hi> ſinfull <hi>carnall feares,</hi> ſinfull
<hi>corrupt intereſts,</hi> ſinfull <hi>fleſhly reaſonings,</hi> ſinfull <hi>paſſions,</hi> and vile
<hi>affections</hi> doe all concur in ſuch a work, are all woven up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in ſuch a Web.</p>
            <p>4. See the diſtance of their <hi>aimes,</hi> God's aime is onely the
manifeſtation of his owne Glory (then which nothing but
himſelfe is ſo infinitely good, nothing ſo righteous that it
ſhould be) and this by the way of goodneſſe and ſeverity,
<hi>Rom. 11. 22. Goodneſſe</hi> in faithfulneſſe and mercy, <hi>preſerving</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:165002:23"/>
his, who are oppoſed, whereby his Glory is exceedingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced:
<hi>Severity</hi> towards the Oppoſers, that by a <hi>ſinfull cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
oppoſition,</hi> they may fill up the meaſure of their iniquities,
and receive this at the hand of the Lord, that they <hi>lye down in
ſorrow,</hi> wherin alſo he is glorious.</p>
            <p>God forbid, that I ſhould ſpeak <hi>this,</hi> of all, that for any
time, or under any <hi>temptation</hi> may be carryed to an oppoſition
in any kind, or degree to the <hi>inſtruments</hi> of Gods glory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them: Many for a ſeaſon may doe it, and yet belong
to God, who ſhall be recovered in due time: It is onely
of men given up, <hi>forſaken,</hi> oppoſing all the <hi>Appearances</hi> of
God with his <hi>Saints</hi> and people in all his wayes, of whom I
ſpeak.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now what are the ends of this</hi> Generation of Fighters <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
this</hi> brazen wall, <hi>and how diſtant from thoſe of the
Lords?</hi> They conſult to caſt him downe from his excellency, whom
God will exalt, Pſal. 62. 4. They thinke not as the Lord, neither doth
their heart meane ſo, but it is in their heart to deſtroy and to cut off,
Iſa. 10. 7. <hi>To ſatisfie their owne corrupt luſts,</hi> ambition, ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
revenge, ſuperſtition, <hi>contempt of Gods people, becauſe
his,</hi> hatred <hi>of the yoak of the LORD,</hi> fleſhly Intereſts; <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for theſe and ſuch like</hi> Ends <hi>as theſe, is their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus though there be a <hi>concurrence</hi> of God and Man in the
ſame thing, yet conſidering the diſtance of their <hi>Principles,
Rules, Actings,</hi> and <hi>Ends;</hi> It is apparent that <hi>Man</hi> doth <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi>
what the <hi>Lord</hi> doth <hi>judicially;</hi> which being an anſwer

<hi>many,</hi> yea the <hi>moſt</hi> of the <hi>Generation,</hi> whoſe good they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
and among whom they live; Oppoſition and fighting
is like to be their <hi>Lot,</hi> and that not onely <hi>it will be ſo</hi> becauſe
of mens luſts, corruptions, prejudices, but alſo <hi>it ſhall be ſo</hi>
from Gods righteous Judgements againſt a ſtubborne people:
<hi>They</hi> harden their hearts <hi>that it may be ſo</hi> to compaſſe their
ends, and God heardens their hearts <hi>that it ſhall be ſo</hi> to bring
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:165002:23"/>
about his aimes: They <hi>will doe it</hi> to execute <hi>their revenge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
others,</hi> They <hi>ſhall doe it</hi> to execute <hi>Gods vengeance</hi> upon
themſelves. This may be for conſolation, that in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
there is nothing but the <hi>wrath of man</hi> againſt them,
whom they oppoſe (which God will reſtraine, or cauſe it
to turne to his praiſe) but there is the <hi>wrath of God</hi> againſt
themſelves, which who can beare? This then let all expect,
who engage their <hi>hearts</hi> to God, and follow the <hi>Lambe</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ever he goeth.</p>
            <p>Men walking in the <hi>ſyncerity of their hearts</hi> are very apt to
conceive that all <hi>Sheaves</hi> ſhould bow to theirs, that all men
ſhould cry <hi>Grace, Grace,</hi> to their proceedings: Why ſhould
any oppoſe? <hi>Quid meruere?</hi> Alas! the more <hi>upright</hi> they
are, the fitter for the Lord by them to breake a Gainſaying
people: Let men keep cloſe to thoſe wayes of God whereto
protection is annexed, and let not their hearts faile them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the people of the Land; the ſtorme of their fury will
be like the <hi>plague</hi> of Haile in <hi>Egipt,</hi> it ſmote onely the <hi>Cattel</hi>
that were in the field; thoſe, who upon the word of <hi>Moſes</hi>

wander in the <hi>field</hi> of their owne wayes, of ſelfe ſeeking,
oppreſſion, ambition, and the like, doubtleſſe the ſtorme
will carry them away; but for thoſe, who keep houſe, who
keep cloſe to the Lord, though it may have much noyſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and dread with it, it ſhall not come nigh them. And if
the Lord for cauſes beſt known, known onely to his infinite
wiſedome, ſhould take off any <hi>Joſiahs</hi> in the oppoſition, he
will certainly effect two things by it.</p>

            <p>I ſpeak of <hi>All</hi> them, and <hi>onely</hi> them who follow the Lord

God, then formerly: and I will certainely blot him out of

ſpake to any of his Saints or people to eſtabliſh a Toleration of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour:</hi>
And yet this is the firſt argument to oppoſe it, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the late Teſtimony of the Reverend and learned Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the Church of <hi>Scotland. Affirmative</hi> precepts muſt be
produced, for a <hi>non Toleration,</hi> that is the puniſhing of erring
perſons. For <hi>actings,</hi> of ſuch high concernment, men doe
generally deſire a better warrant then this, <hi>There is nothing in
the Word againſt them.</hi> Cleare <hi>light</hi> is needfull for men, who
walke in <hi>paths,</hi> which lead directly to houſes of <hi>Blood.</hi> God
hath not ſpoken of <hi>Non-Toleratin,</hi> is a certaine rule of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance.</hi>
But God hath not ſpoken of <hi>Toleration,</hi> is no rule of
<hi>acting</hi> in oppoſition thereunto. (What he hath ſpoken one
<hi>way</hi> or <hi>other,</hi> ſhall be afterwards conſidered.) <hi>Poſitive actings</hi>
muſt have <hi>poſitive precepts,</hi> and rules for them, as <hi>conſcience</hi> is
its owne guide. If then you will have <hi>perſons</hi> deviating in their
apprehenſions from the <hi>truth</hi> of the Goſpell, civilly <hi>puniſhed,</hi>
you muſt bring better <hi>warrant</hi> then this, that God hath not
ſpoken againſt it, or <hi>I ſhall not walke in your wayes, but refraine
my foot from your path.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That undoubtedly there are very many things under
the <hi>command</hi> of the Lord, ſo becomming our <hi>duty,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his <hi>promiſe,</hi> ſo made our <hi>priviledge,</hi> which yet if not <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,</hi>
or not <hi>enjoyed,</hi> are not of <hi>humane</hi> cognizance, as <hi>faith</hi>
it ſelfe. Yet becauſe the <hi>knowledge of the Truth</hi> is in that rank
of things, this alſo is urged as of weight, by the ſame <hi>learned
perſons,</hi> to the buſineſſe in hand.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Errours,</hi> though never ſo impious, are yet diſtinguiſhed
from <hi>Peace-diſturbing</hi> enormities. If <hi>Opinions</hi> in their owne
nature tend to the diſturbance of the <hi>publike peace,</hi> either that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:165002:25"/>
               <hi>publick Tranquilitie</hi> is not of God, or God alloweth a penall
reſtraint of thoſe <hi>Opinions.</hi> It is a miſtake, to affirme, that
thoſe who plead for <hi>Toleration,</hi> doe allow of <hi>puniſhment</hi> for
<hi>offences</hi> againſt the <hi>ſecond</hi> Table, not againſt the <hi>firſt.</hi> The caſe
is the ſame both in reſpect of the <hi>one,</hi> and the <hi>other.</hi> What
Offences againſt the <hi>ſecond</hi> Table are puniſhable? Doubtleſſe
not all: but onely ſuch as by a <hi>diſorderly Eruption</hi> pervert the
courſe of <hi>publicke</hi> quiet and ſociety. Yea none but ſuch, fall
under <hi>humane</hi> Cognizance. The warrant of exerciſing <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive
power</hi> amongſt men, is from the <hi>reference</hi> of Offences
to their common tranquility. <hi>Delicta puniri, publice intereſt.</hi>
Where puniſhment is the <hi>debt, Bonum totius,</hi> is the <hi>Creditour</hi>
to exact it. And this is allowed, as to the Offences againſt the
firſt Table, If any of <hi>them</hi> in their owne Nature (not ſome
mens apprehenſions) are <hi>diſturbances</hi> of publick peace, <hi>they
alſo</hi> are puniſhable. Only let not this be meaſured by diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
conſequences, no more then the other are. Let the <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
be in the things themſelves, and <hi>Actum eſt,</hi> let who will
<hi>plead</hi> for them. Hence,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Popiſh Religion,</hi> warming in its very Bowels, a fatall <hi>Engine</hi>
againſt all <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> amongſt us, cannot upon our Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
plead for Forbearance: It being a knowne and received
<hi>Maxime,</hi> that the Goſpell of Chriſt, claſhes againſt no <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi>
ordinance of man.</p>
            <p>And this be ſpoken to the third Argument of the forenam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Reverend perſons from the <hi>Analogie</hi> of delinquencies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the firſt and ſecond Table.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Plea</hi> for the puniſhment of Erring perſons, from
the <hi>penall conſtitution</hi> under the Old Teſtament againſt <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters</hi>
(which in the next place is urged) ſeemes not very
firme and convincing. The vaſt <hi>diſtance</hi> that is between <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi>
and any <hi>Errors</hi> whatſoever, as meerly ſuch, however pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
or maintained with <hi>Obſtinacy,</hi> much impaireth the
ſtrength of this Argumentation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Idolatry</hi> is the yeelding unto a <hi>Creature</hi> the <hi>ſervice and worſhip</hi>
due to the <hi>Creator: Reinold. de. Idol. li. 2. Cap. 1. S. 1. Idolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latria

1. 25. plainely, that whereunto the <hi>Sanction</hi> under debate
was added, as the bond of the Law againſt it (which was
the bottom of the commendable proceedings of diverſe Kings
of <hi>Judah</hi> againſt ſuch) was a <hi>voluntary relinquiſhment of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi>
revealed unto them, to give the honour due unto him
to <hi>dunghill Idols.</hi> Now though <hi>Error</hi> and Ignorance ofttimes
lye as the bottome of this <hi>abhomination,</hi> yet <hi>Error</hi> properly ſo
called, and which under the name of <hi>Hereſie</hi> is oppoſed, is
ſufficiently differenced therefrom. That Common definition
of Hereſie, that it is an <hi>Error, or Errors in or about the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals
of Religion, maintained with ſtubbornneſſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy
after Conviction</hi> (for the maine received by moſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Divines) will be no way ſuited unto <hi>that,</hi> which was
before given of <hi>Idolatry</hi> and is at commonly received; being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
much more cleare, as ſhall be afterward declared. That
this <hi>latter</hi> is proper and ſuitable to thoſe <hi>Scripturall deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
which we have of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> I dare not aſſert: but being
received by <hi>them</hi> who urge the <hi>puniſhment</hi> thereof, it may be
a ſufficient ground of affirming, that <hi>thoſe things</hi> whoſe <hi>defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions</hi>
are ſo extreamely different, are alſo very <hi>diſtant</hi> and
diſcrepant in themſelves, and therefore <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> for the
diſpoſall of things concerning the <hi>one,</hi> cannot <hi>eo nomine,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the <hi>other.</hi> Neither is the <hi>Inference</hi> any ſtronger, then,
that a man may be <hi>hanged</hi> for <hi>coveting,</hi> becauſe he may be <hi>ſo</hi>
for <hi>murdering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The penall <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of the <hi>Judaicall policy</hi> (for ſo they
were which yet I urge not) concerning <hi>Idolaters,</hi> muſt be
ſtretched beyond their <hi>Limits,</hi> if you intend to enwrap <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>
within their Verge. If <hi>Hereticks</hi> be alſo <hi>Idolaters,</hi> as the
<hi>Papiſts.</hi> (The poor <hi>Indians</hi> who worſhip a piece of <hi>red cloath,</hi>
the <hi>Egiptians</hi> who adored the <hi>Deities,</hi> which grew in their

to breath out his ſoule, in this expreſſion of that ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,
<hi>Quoniam Chriſtiani manducant Deum quem adorant, ſit
anima mea cum Philoſophis.</hi>) I ſay then, the <hi>caſe</hi> ſeemes to me,
to have received ſo conſiderable an <hi>alteration</hi> that the <hi>Plea</hi> of
<hi>forbearance</hi> is extreamely weakened; as to my preſent appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion:
However for the preſent, I remove ſuch from this
debate.</p>
            <p>5. The like to this alſo, may be ſaid concerning <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi>
the <hi>Law</hi> whereof is likewiſe commonly urged in this cauſe.
The eſtabliſhment for the puniſhment of a <hi>Blaſphemer</hi> is in <hi>Lev.</hi>
24. 16. Given it was upon the occaſion of the <hi>blaſpheming</hi> and
<hi>curſing</hi> of the Son of an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> upon his ſtriving &amp; conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with an <hi>Iſraelite.</hi> Being (probably) in his own <hi>apprehenſion</hi>
wronged by his <hi>Adverſary,</hi> he fell to <hi>Reviling</hi> his God. The
Word here uſed to expreſſe his ſinne, is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifying alſo
to <hi>peirce,</hi> and is twice ſo rendered, <hi>Iſa. 36. 6. Hab.</hi> 3. 14.
Deſperate expreſſions <hi>peircing</hi> the honour and glory of the
moſt High, willingly and wilfully, were doubtleſſe his <hi>death
deſerving</hi> crime. It is the ſame word that <hi>Balack</hi> uſed to <hi>Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam,</hi>
when he would have perſwaded him to a <hi>deliberate</hi> curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and powring out of the <hi>Imprecations</hi> on the people of
God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 13, 14. A reſolved <hi>peircing</hi> of the Name and
glory of God, with curſed <hi>reproaches,</hi> is the crime here ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
to death. The <hi>Schoolemen</hi> tell us, that to compleate
<hi>Blaſphemy</hi> of the perverſe <hi>affection</hi> in the Heart in deteſtation of
the goodneſſe of God, joyned with the Reproaches of his
Name, is required. <hi>Thom. 22ae. g. 13. a. 1. ad 1 um.</hi> Which how
remote it is from <hi>Error</hi> of any ſort (I meane within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
of them whereof we ſpeak) being a pure miſapprehenſion
of the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> imbraced (though falſely) for the honor
of God, I ſuppoſe is eaſily conceived: and ſo conſequently
that the <hi>Argument</hi> for the death of a perſon <hi>erring,</hi> becauſe
he came off no eaſier, of old who <hi>blaſphemed,</hi> is a <hi>baculo ad
angulum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:165002:27"/>
If any ſhall ſay that <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> is of a larger extent, and
more generall acceptation in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> I ſhall not deny
it. But yet that, that <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>blaſphemy</hi> which was puniſhable
with <hi>violent</hi> death, was comprehenſive of any <hi>inferiour crime,</hi>
I ſuppoſe cannot be proved. However, <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is never taken in any place that I can remember,<note place="margin">Acts 26. 11.</note> for a
mans <hi>maintaining</hi> his owne <hi>Error,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 18. 6.</note> but for his <hi>reviling</hi> and
ſpeaking evill of the <hi>Truth</hi> which he receiveth not,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 13.</note> and ſo
<hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion was a <hi>Blaſphemer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if men to whom <hi>forbearance</hi> is indulged in <hi>by-paths</hi> of
their owne, ſhall make it their <hi>worke</hi> to caſt dirt on the <hi>better</hi>
wayes of <hi>truth,</hi> it is to me very queſtionable whether they do
not offend againſt that <hi>prime</hi> dictate of nature, for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of <hi>humane</hi> ſociety, <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceris;</hi>
and for ſuch, I will be no Advocate.</p>
            <p>Neither can indeed the <hi>Law of Blaſpbemy,</hi> be impartially
urged by us in any caſe of Hereſie whatſoever. For,</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>paenall Sanctions</hi> of the Lawes of God are not in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
eſteemed of <hi>Morall</hi> equity, and perpetually indiſpenſable;
for if ſo, why doe <hi>Adulterers</hi> unmoleſted, behold the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
death of <hi>Stealers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Blaſphemer</hi> by that <hi>Law</hi> was not allowed his <hi>Clergy.</hi>
Dye he muſt without mercy, no <hi>roome</hi> being left for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of <hi>Repentance,</hi> as to the removall of his <hi>temporall</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
When once the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> Garments were rent, he
was <hi>Anathema:</hi> But in caſe of any <hi>Hereſie,</hi> repentance, yea
<hi>Recantation</hi> is a ſure <hi>Antidote</hi> (at leaſt for once, ſo it is among
the Papiſts) againſt all corporall ſufferings.</p>
            <p>6. Neither doth that place in <hi>Zachary, Chap. 13. v.</hi> 3. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>running through</hi> of the falſe <hi>Prophet,</hi> more prove or
approve of <hi>the puniſhment</hi> of death to be inflicted for <hi>miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions</hi>
in the matters of Religion (and if it proves not
that, it proveth nothing, for <hi>ſlaying</hi> is the thing expreſſed, and
certainely if <hi>proofes</hi> be taken from the <hi>Letter,</hi> the <hi>Letter</hi> muſt
be obeyed, or we force the Word to ſerve our <hi>Hypotheſis</hi>) then

an <hi>Orleans</hi> gloſſe is ſcarce ſufficient to ſecure a <hi>conſcience</hi> in

            <p>7. From the aſſerting of the authority, and deſcription of
the duty of the Magiſtrate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. the <hi>Argument</hi> is very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
that is produced, for the ſuppreſſing, by <hi>externall force,</hi> of
<hi>erronious</hi> perſons: The <hi>Paralogiſme</hi> is ſo ſoule and notorious,
in this arguing, <hi>hee is to ſuppreſſe evill deeds, Hereſie is an evill
deed, therefore that alſo,</hi> that it needs no confutation. That he
is to puniſh all evill deeds was never yet affirmed. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliefe</hi> is

diſturbe that <hi>humane Society,</hi> the defence and protection wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

is to him committed. That among the <hi>Number</hi> of theſe, are
<hi>Errours,</hi> the depravations of mens underſtandings, hath not
yet been proved.</p>
            <p>8. The caſe of the <hi>Seducer,</hi> from <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. is urged with
more ſhew of <hi>reaſon</hi> then any of the others, to the <hi>buſineſſe</hi> in
hand; but yet the extreame <hi>diſcrepancies</hi> between the <hi>proofe,</hi>
and the thing intended to be <hi>proved,</hi> make any <hi>Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
from this <hi>place,</hi> as to the matter in hand, very <hi>intricate,</hi>
obſcure, and difficult. For,</p>
            <p>1. The Perſon here ſpoken of, pretends an immediate <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi>
from Heaven: he pretends <hi>Dreames,</hi> and gives <hi>ſignes
and wonders, v.</hi> 1. and ſo exempts his ſpirit from any <hi>regular</hi>
tryall: <hi>Hereticks</hi> for the moſt part, offer to be tryed by the
<hi>Rule</hi> that is <hi>in Medio,</hi> acknowledged of all; a few diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> excepted.</p>
            <p>2. His buſineſſe is, to <hi>Entice</hi> from the worſhip of <hi>Jehovah,</hi>
not in reſpect of the manner but the object, <hi>v. 5. All Hereticks</hi>
pretend the feare of that great Name.</p>
            <p>3. The accepting and owning <hi>Idoll dunghill Gods</hi> in his
roome, is the thing <hi>perſwaded to, v.</hi> 2, (and thoſe were onely
Stocks and Stones) and this in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who
had revealed himſelfe by <hi>Moſes. Hereticks,</hi> worſhip him, <hi>owne</hi>
him, and abhorre all <hi>thoughts</hi> of turning away from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after him, according to their <hi>Erronious</hi> apprehenſions.
<hi>Manichees, Marcionites, Valentinians,</hi> and ſuch like names of
Infidels, I reckon not among Hereticks, neither will their
brainſick <hi>Paganiſh follies,</hi> be poſſibly comprehended under
that definition of <hi>Hereſie</hi> which is now generally received.
<hi>Mahumetans</hi> are farre more rightly tearmed <hi>Hereticks,</hi> then
they.</p>
            <p>4. This <hi>Seducer</hi> was to dye without mercy: And <hi>Aynſworth</hi>
obſerves from the <hi>Rabbines,</hi> that this <hi>Offender</hi> alone, had
<hi>traps</hi> laid to catch him; and were he but once overheard to
whiſper <hi>his ſeduction,</hi> though never ſo ſecretly, there was no
<hi>Expiation</hi> of his tranſgreſſion, without his owne blood: but
now this <hi>place</hi> is urged for all kind of reſtraint and <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
whatſoever. (Now where God requires <hi>blood,</hi> is it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to man, to <hi>Commute</hi> at an inferiour <hi>Rate?</hi>) So I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:165002:28"/>
it is urged. But yet what lyes at the <hi>Bottome,</hi> in the <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of their bellyes</hi> who plead for the <hi>Power</hi> of the Magiſtrate
to puniſh <hi>erring</hi> Perſons, from thoſe and ſuch like <hi>places</hi> as
theſe, is too apparent. <hi>Blood</hi> is there: <hi>ſwiftly,</hi> or <hi>ſlowly,</hi> they
walke to the Chambers of death.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Obſtinacy</hi> after conviction, <hi>Turbulency, &amp;c.</hi> which are now
laid downe, as the maine <hi>weights</hi> that turne the <hi>Scale</hi> on the
ſide of <hi>Severity,</hi> are here not once mentioned, nor by any
thing in the leaſt intimated. If he have <hi>done</hi> it, yea but <hi>once,</hi>
openly, or ſecretly, whether he have been <hi>convinced</hi> of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
of it, or no, be he <hi>obſtinate</hi> or otherwiſe, it is not
once inquired, dye he muſt, as if he had committed <hi>Murder,</hi>
or the like indiſpenſable <hi>death-procuring</hi> crime. If the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then of <hi>erring</hi> Perſons be urged from this place, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of their <hi>Conviction, Obſtinacy, Pertinacy,</hi> muſt be laid
aſide: the <hi>Text</hi> allows them no more Plea in this buſineſſe,
then our <hi>Law</hi> doth in the caſe of wilfull Murder.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Recantation</hi> will in the judgement of all,
reprieve an <hi>erring perſon</hi> from any ſentence of any <hi>puniſhment</hi>
corporall whatſoever; and many reaſons may be given, why
they ſhould ſo doe. Here is no ſuch allowance. <hi>Repent</hi> or not
<hi>repent, recant</hi> or not <hi>recant,</hi> he hath no ſacrifice of <hi>Expiation</hi>
provided for him, dye he muſt.</p>
            <p>7. This <hi>Law</hi> containes the <hi>Sanction</hi> of the third Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
as the <hi>whole,</hi> was a Rule of the <hi>Jewiſh politie</hi> in the
Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> This amongſt us is generally conceived not
binding, as <hi>ſuch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. <hi>The formall reaſon of this</hi> Law <hi>by ſome inſiſted on,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
be ſought to turne a man from Jehovah:</p>
            <p>1. Is of force onely in this caſe of the <hi>object</hi> whereunto <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi>
tends; <hi>viz.</hi> ſtrange gods, and no other.</p>
            <p>2. Turning from <hi>Jehovah</hi> reſpects not any manner of back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlyding
in reſpect of the way of worſhip, but a falling away
from him as the <hi>object</hi> of worſhip.</p>
            <p>Now there being theſe and many other <hi>diſcrepancies</hi> hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the caſes propoſed from running <hi>parallell,</hi> I profeſſe for
my part, I cannot ſee how any ſuch <hi>evident</hi> deductions can
poſſibly be drawne from hence, as to be made a bottome of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:165002:29"/>
               <hi>practiſe</hi> and acting in things of ſo high concernment. What
may be allowed from the <hi>equity</hi> of thoſe and the like <hi>Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and deduced by <hi>Analogie</hi> and proportion to the buſineſſe
in hand, I ſhall afterwards declare.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſumme</hi> of what is uſually drawne out from <hi>holy Writ,</hi>
againſt ſuch a <hi>forbearance,</hi> as I ſuppoſe may be aſſerted, and
for the puniſhing <hi>Hereticks</hi> with <hi>Capitall puniſhments</hi> being
briefly diſcuſſed, I proceed in the next place to ſuch other <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
obſervations,</hi> as may ſerve to the further clearing of the
buſineſſe in hand, and they are theſe that follow.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>forbearance of,</hi> or oppoſition <hi>unto</hi> Errors, may be
conſidered, with reſpect either unto <hi>Civill</hi> or <hi>Spiritual</hi> Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
For the <hi>Latter,</hi> it is either <hi>Perſonall or Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
ſo called. <hi>Perſonall</hi> forbearance of Errors in a <hi>ſpirituall</hi>
ſenſe, is a <hi>Moral</hi> Toleration or <hi>approbation</hi> of them. So alſo
is Eccleſiaſticall. The <hi>Warrant</hi> for <hi>proceedance</hi> againſt them,
on that hand is plaine and evident. Certainely <hi>this way, no
Error</hi> is to be forborne. All perſons who have any <hi>Intereſt</hi>
and ſhare in <hi>Truth,</hi> are obliged in their <hi>ſeverall</hi> wayes and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
to an oppoſition unto every Error. An oppoſition to
be carryed on by Goſpel <hi>Mediums,</hi> and ſpirituall weapons.
Let them according as they are called or opportuned, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them from the Word, <hi>Contending earneſtly for the faith
once delivered unto the Saints:</hi> Erring Perſons are uſually
(<hi>Bono animo,</hi> ſayes <hi>Salvian</hi>) very <hi>zealous</hi> to propogate their
falſe conceptions; and ſhall the <hi>Children</hi> of Truth be back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in her defence. <hi>Precepts</hi> unto this as a duty, <hi>commendations</hi>
of it, <hi>incouragements</hi> unto it, are very frequent in the Goſpel. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
is this <hi>duty</hi> incumbent on all <hi>Churches</hi> walking to the rule.
The ſpirituall Sword of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> may be lawfully ſheathed
in the <hi>blood</hi> of Hereſies. No ſpirituall <hi>Remedy,</hi> can be too
ſharpe for a ſpirituall <hi>diſeaſe.</hi> When the <hi>Cure</hi> is ſuited to the
<hi>Malady,</hi> there is no danger of the <hi>application.</hi> And this is not
denyed by any. He that ſubmits himſelfe to any <hi>Church ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
does it <hi>ea lege,</hi> of being obedient to the <hi>Authority of Chriſt;</hi>
in that Church in all its Cenſures. <hi>Volenti non fit injuria.</hi>
Error is <hi>offenſive,</hi> and muſt be proceeded againſt. <hi>Examples</hi>
and <hi>precepts</hi> of this, abound in the Scriptures. The <hi>blood</hi> of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:165002:29"/>
many erring perſons (I doubt not) will one day have a <hi>Quo
warranto</hi> granted them, againſt their (as to the particulars
in debate) <hi>Orthodox</hi> ſlayers, who did it to promote the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God. Let them not fear an <hi>after reckoning,</hi> who uſe the
<hi>Diſcipline</hi> of Chriſt, according to his appointment.</p>
            <p>This being conſidered, the <hi>occaſion</hi> of a moſt frequent <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralogiſme</hi>
is removed. If errours muſt be <hi>tolerated,</hi> ſay ſome,
then men may doe what they pleaſe, without controll? <hi>No
meanes</hi> it ſeems muſt be uſed to reclaime them? But! is <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
Conviction</hi> no meanes? Hath the Sword of <hi>Diſcipline</hi> no
edge? Is there no <hi>meanes</hi> of inſtruction in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi>
eſtabliſhed, but a Priſon and a Halter? Are the <hi>Hammer</hi> of
the Word, and the <hi>Sword</hi> of the Spirit, which in days of Old,
<hi>broke</hi> the ſtubbornneſt Mountaines, and <hi>overcame</hi> the prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
Nations, now quite uſeleſſe? God forbid. Were the
<hi>Churches</hi> of Chriſt, eſtabliſhed according to his <hi>appointment,</hi> and the profeſſors of the <hi>Truth,</hi> ſo knit up <hi>in the unity of the
Spirit and bond of peace,</hi> as they ought to be, and were in the
<hi>Primitive</hi> times; I am perſwaded thoſe <hi>deſpiſed</hi> Inſtruments
would quickly make the proudeſt <hi>Hereticke</hi> to tremble. When
the <hi>Churches</hi> walked in ſweet <hi>Communion,</hi> giving each other
continuall <hi>account</hi> of their <hi>affaires,</hi> and warning each other
of all, or any ſuch perſons, as either in practice, or doctrine,
walked not with a <hi>right foot</hi> (as we have examples in <hi>Clem.
Epiſt. ad Corinth.</hi> the Churches of <hi>Vienna and Lyons,</hi> to thoſe
of <hi>Aſia: Euſeb.</hi> of <hi>Ignatius</hi> to ſeverall perſons and Churches,
of <hi>Iraeneus</hi> to <hi>Victor. Euſeb. Dyoniſius</hi> to <hi>Stephen, ibid.</hi> and
the like) <hi>Hereticks</hi> found ſuch cold entertainment, as made
them <hi>aſhamed</hi> if not weary of their <hi>choſen</hi> wanderings; but
this is not my <hi>preſent</hi> buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>2. There is an <hi>oppoſition,</hi> or <hi>forbearance,</hi> in reference to a <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi>
Judicature, and proceedence of things, which reſpecteth
Errors, in a <hi>Reall</hi> ſenſe, as to the inflicting, or not inflicting of
<hi>puniſhment,</hi> on Religious Delinquents. And this is the <hi>ſole</hi> thing
under debate, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether Perſons enjoying civill Authority over others, being
intruſted therewithall, according to the Conſtitutions of the place
and Nation where the lot of them both, by Providence is fallen,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:165002:30"/>
are inveſted with power from above, and commanded in the Word
of God, to coerce, reſtraine, puniſh, confine, impriſon, baniſh,
hange, or burne, ſuch of thoſe perſons under their juriſdiction, as
ſhall not embrace, profeſſe, beleeve, and practice, that Truth and
way of worſhip, which is revealed unto them of God, or how far, into
what degrees, by what means, in any of theſe wayes, may they proceed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Generall</hi> propoſitions and conſiderations of the <hi>penall
Lawes</hi> of God, which were before laid downe, have, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
left this buſineſſe to a naked debate from the word of
truth, without any ſuch <hi>prejudices</hi> on either part, as many
take from a <hi>miſapprehenſion</hi> of the mind of God in them; and
therefore by the Readers patience, I ſhall venture upon the
<hi>whole</hi> anew, as if no ſuch <hi>arguments</hi> had ever been propoſed,
for the <hi>affirmative</hi> of the Queſtion in hand, not declining the
utmoſt <hi>weight,</hi> that is in any of them, according to equity
and due proportion. And here firſt I ſhall give in a <hi>few</hi> things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. To the <hi>Queſtion</hi> it ſelfe.</item>
               <item>2. To the <hi>Manner</hi> of handling it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. To the <hi>Queſtion</hi> it ſelfe, for herein, I ſuppoſe,</p>
            <p>1. That the Perſons enjoying <hi>Authority,</hi> doe alſo enjoy the
<hi>truth,</hi> which is to the advantage of the <hi>Affirmative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That their <hi>Power</hi> in <hi>civill</hi> things is <hi>jnſt</hi> and unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which alſo looſes favourably on that ſide.</p>
            <p>3. That <hi>Non-toleration</hi> makes out it ſelfe in poſitive infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>puniſhment,</hi> which <hi>is ſo,</hi> or is <hi>nothing.</hi> Caſting men
out of <hi>protection,</hi> expoſing them to <hi>vulgar violence,</hi> is confeſtly
unworthy of men repreſenting the authority of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the <hi>whole end</hi> of their truſt.</p>
            <p>2. To the manner of handling this Queſtion among per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
at variance; and here, I cannot but obſerve.</p>
            <p>1. That if I have taken my <hi>aime</hi> aright, there is no one
<hi>thing</hi> under debate amongſt <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that is agitated with
more <hi>confidence</hi> and mutuall animoſity of the <hi>Parties</hi> Litigant:
Each charging other with dreadfull <hi>inferences,</hi> ſtreames of
blood, and diſhonour to God, flowing out from their <hi>ſeverall</hi>
perſwaſions. So that ofttimes, in ſtead of a <hi>faire</hi> diſpute, you
meet on this ſubject with a <hi>Patheticall</hi> outcry, as though all
Religion were utterly contaminated and trampled underfoot,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:165002:30"/>
if both theſe <hi>contradictory</hi> aſſertions, be not imbraced. Now
ſeeing that in it ſelfe, it is a thing wherein the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<hi>ſparing,</hi> if not altogether ſilent, certainely there muſt
be a further <hi>Intereſt,</hi> then of Judgement alone, or elſe that, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much <hi>prejudicated</hi> with corrupt <hi>affections,</hi> or men could not
poſſibly be carryed out with ſo much <hi>violence,</hi> upon ſuppoſed
<hi>ſelfe-created</hi> conſequences, wherwith in this cauſe they urge one
another.</p>
            <p>2. That generally, thus much of <hi>private Intereſt</hi> appeares
in the ſeverall <hi>conteſters</hi> that <hi>Non-toleration</hi> is the Opinion of
the <hi>many,</hi> and theſe enjoyning the <hi>countenance</hi> of <hi>Authority: To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration</hi>
of the Oppreſſed, who alwayes goe under the Name
of the <hi>faction</hi> or <hi>factions,</hi> the unavoidable <hi>Livery</hi> of the ſmaller
number profeſſing <hi>a way of worſhip</hi> by themſelves, be it <hi>right</hi>
or wrong. I doe not deſire to lay forth the uſuall <hi>deportment,</hi>
of men, ſeeking the ſuppreſſing of others differing from them,
towards <hi>thoſe</hi> in Authority. It is but <hi>too clearely</hi> made out, by
dayly experience: If they cloſe with them, they are <hi>Cuſtodes
utriuſque Tabulae,</hi> the Churches <hi>Nurſing Fathers, &amp;c.</hi> what
they pleaſe. But if they draw back for want of <hi>light</hi> or <hi>truth</hi>
to ſerve them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Logges</hi> and <hi>Storks</hi> find not worſe entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from <hi>Froggs,</hi> then they from ſome of them. Such things
as theſe, may, (nay <hi>ought</hi> to) be eſpecially heeded by every
one, that knowes what <hi>influence</hi> corrupt affections have
upon the <hi>judgements</hi> of men, and would willingly take the
paines to wipe his <hi>Eyes</hi> for the diſcerning of the truth.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, I <hi>aſſert,</hi> That</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Non-Toleration</hi> in the Latitude, which is for <hi>Perſons in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
enjoying the truth (or ſuppoſing they doe enjoy it)
to puniſh in an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> way, (according to what they ſhall
conceive to be <hi>condigne.</hi>) men, who will not forſake their
owne convictions, about any head, or heads, of Chriſtian
Religion whatſoever; to joyne with what they hold out,
either for beliefe or worſhip (after the uſing of ſuch wayes of
perſwaſion as they ſhall thinke fit) is no way <hi>warranted</hi> in
the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> nor can any <hi>ſound proofe</hi> for ſuch a courſe be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> out of the <hi>Law</hi> which I can apprehend to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:165002:31"/>
have any <hi>colour or appearance</hi> of ſtrength in them, with the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi>
approved of God, that ſeem to look this way: I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
at our entrance into this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I ſpeake of <hi>puniſhing</hi> in an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> way, for all <hi>inſtances</hi>
produced to the <hi>purpoſe</hi> in hand, that ſpeak of any <hi>puniſhment,</hi>
mention nothing under <hi>death</hi> it ſelfe; which yet (at leaſt in
the firſt place) is not aymed at by thoſe that uſe them in our
dayes as I ſuppoſe. Now ſome <hi>Divines</hi> of no ſmall Name,
maintain, that God hath not left the <hi>impoſition</hi> of puniſhment
in any meaſure, to the <hi>wils</hi> of men.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>Arguments</hi> for the proofe of the former Aſſertion as
layd downe, I ſhall in due place make uſe of; for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
I deſire to commend to the ſerious pondering of all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
in generall, eſpecially of <hi>thoſe</hi> in Authority, theſe enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conſiderations.</p>
            <p>1. That it is no <hi>priviledge</hi> of truth, to furniſh it's <hi>Aſſertors,</hi>
with this perſwaſion, that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from it, ought <hi>forcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>
to be oppoſed, reſtrained, puniſhed: No <hi>falſe Religion</hi> ever
yet in the World, did enthrone it ſelfe in the minds of men,
enjoyning a <hi>civill ſoveraignty</hi> over the perſons of others, but it
there withall commanded them, under paine of <hi>neglect</hi> and
<hi>contempt</hi> of it ſelfe, to cruſh any <hi>underling worſhip,</hi> that would
perke up in inferiour <hi>conſciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The old <hi>Heathens</hi> carryed their <hi>Gods</hi> into the Warre (as
did the <hi>Philiſtims, 1 Chron.</hi> 14. 12. and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> the <hi>Arke</hi>
with Heatheniſh ſuperſtition, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 3.) to whom they
aſcribed the <hi>ſucceſſe</hi> they obtained, and in requitall of their
kindneſſe, they forced the dunghill <hi>Deities</hi> of the conquered
Nations, to attend the tryumph of their Victorious Idols; and
unleſſe they adopted them into the number of their owne
Gods, all further <hi>worſhip</hi> to them was forbidden. Hence
were theſe <hi>inventions</hi> among the old <hi>Romans,</hi> by ſpells and
Enchantments to entiſe away a <hi>Deity</hi> from any City they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged,
(they being as expert at the getting of a Devill, as
<hi>Tobias's Raphael,</hi> or the preſent <hi>Romaniſts</hi> at his fumigation)
by which means they ſhrived into the honor of having 30000
unconquered Idols (as <hi>Varro in Auguſtine de civit. Dei.</hi>)
and deſerved worthily, that change of their Cities <hi>Epithete;</hi>

this thing.</p>
            <p>Now not to ſpeak of <hi>Caine,</hi> who ſeems to me, to have layd
the foundation of that <hi>cruelty,</hi> which was afterward inſerted
into the Churches <hi>Orthodoxies,</hi> by the name of <hi>Haereticidium,</hi>

of Chriſtians, and ſo not to be queſtioned, yet that it
may appear, that we are not the <hi>onely men</hi> in this Generation,
that this wiſedome of <hi>puniſhing diſſenters</hi> was not born with
us, I ſhall briefly give in, what <hi>grounds</hi> they proceeded on, and
the <hi>motives</hi> they had to proceed as they did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:165002:32"/>
               <hi>Firſt, then, they enacted it as a</hi> Law, <hi>that no</hi> religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<hi>ſhould be</hi> admitted <hi>or</hi> practiſed, <hi>without the</hi> conſent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
and eſtabliſhment <hi>of the Senate.</hi> Mention <hi>is made of a
formall</hi> Law <hi>to this purpoſe in</hi> Tertullian, Apol. cap. 5. <hi>though
now we find it not. The</hi> foundation <hi>of it was doubtleſſe in that
of the twelve</hi> Tables: Separatim nemo habeſſit Deos, neue novos,
ſed ne Aduenas niſi publice aſcitos privatim colunto. Let none
have Gods to himſelfe, neither let any privately worſhip new or
ſtrange Deities, unleſſe they be publiquely owned and enrolled. <hi>And
that it was their</hi> practiſe <hi>and in the</hi> counſells <hi>of the wiſeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

Worſhip (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) the divine power thy
ſelfe, according to the conſtitutions of thy Countrey, alwayes and

Gods ſake, whom yet whoſo contemneth, hee will never doe any
honourable thing, but becauſe, theſe (not ſo worſhipping)
introducing new Deities, doe perſwade many to tranſgreſſe (or to
change affaires) whence are conjurations, ſeditions, private ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
things no way conducing to Monarchies.</p>
            <p>Hence doubtleſſe was that <hi>oppoſition,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

            <p>This if <hi>occaſion</hi> were, might be eaſily demonſtrated from

are in the <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> blinded with <hi>Error,</hi> of whom wee
have ſpoken, be a ſufficient <hi>Plea,</hi> we ſhall ſee anon. In the
meane time, we may doe well to remember, what <hi>Lewes</hi> the
twelth of <hi>France</hi> ſaid, yea ſwore concerning the Inhabitants
of <hi>Mirindoll,</hi> whom by the inſtigation of <hi>his Prelates</hi> he had
ordered to be ſlaine, when newes was brought him, what
was their converſation and way of life, <hi>Let them be Hereticks
if you pleaſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but aſſuredly they are better then me, and
my Catholicks.</hi> Take heed leaſt the puniſhed, be better then
the puniſhers.</p>
            <p>Let me add to this Obſervation onely <hi>this,</hi> that the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:165002:36"/>
to ſuppreſſe any <hi>Opinions</hi> whatſoever by <hi>Force,</hi> hath
been for the moſt part fruitleſſe; for either ſome <hi>few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
perſons,</hi> are proceeded againſt, or elſe greater <hi>multitudes:</hi>
If ſome <hi>particulars</hi> only, the <hi>Aſhes</hi> of one, hath alwayes
proved the ſeed of many Opinionatiiſts: Examples are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable,
take one, which is boaſted of, as a <hi>patterne</hi> of ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
taken from Antiquity. About the yeare 390. <hi>Priſcillianus,
a Manichee, and a Gnoſticke,</hi> by the procurement of <hi>Ithacius
and Idacius,</hi> two <hi>Biſhops,</hi> was put to death by <hi>Maximus,</hi> an
uſurping Emperour, who ruled for a ſeaſon, having ſlaine
<hi>Gratianus;</hi> (as that kind of men, would always cloſe with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Authority,</hi> that might ſerve their owne Ends.) Now what
was the iſſue thereof; <hi>Martinus</hi> a Catholick Biſhop re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces
their Communion who did it: The <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> that
reports it, giving this cenſure of the whole, <hi>Sic peſſimo exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plo,
ſublati ſunt homines luce indigniſſimi,</hi> though the men
(<hi>Priſcillian and his Companions</hi>) were moſt <hi>unworthy</hi> to live,
yet their ſentence to death, was moſt <hi>unjuſt.</hi> But no matter
for this, was not the Hereſie ſuppreſſed thereby? See what
the ſame <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> who wrote not long after, and was able
to teſtifie the event, ſayes of it (it is <hi>Severus Sulpitius, lib. 2.
Eccleſ. Hiſt.) Non ſolum non repreſſa eſt haereſis</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>ſed
confirmata, &amp; Latius propagata eſt, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>hereſie</hi> was ſo
farre from being <hi>ſuppreſſed</hi> hereby, that it was <hi>confirmed</hi>
and propagated: His followers who before <hi>honoured</hi> him as
a <hi>Saint,</hi> now <hi>adore</hi> him as a <hi>Martyr:</hi> The like in all Ages hath
been the iſſue, of the <hi>like</hi> indeavours.</p>
            <p>But now, if this courſe be undertaken againſt <hi>Multitudes,</hi>
what is or hath been the uſuall End of ſuch undertakings?
Take ſome examples of late dayes: <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, the moſt
mighty <hi>Emperour of Germany,</hi> undertakes by violence to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> out of the Empire. After
a tedious <hi>Warre,</hi> the <hi>death</hi> of many thouſands, the <hi>waſting</hi> of
the Nation, in the cloſe of all, himſelfe is driven out of
<hi>Germany;</hi> and the buſineſſe left much where it begun: <hi>Sleid.
Com. Philip of Spaine</hi> will needs force the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> upon

               <hi>Patrick Hamilton,</hi> and <hi>George Wiſhard</hi> are put to death in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> by the procurement of a <hi>Cardinall;</hi> the <hi>Cardinall</hi>
is inſtantly murthered by ſome deſperate young men, and a
<hi>war</hi> raiſed there about <hi>Religion,</hi> which was never well quieted,
untill having hunted their <hi>Queene</hi> out of her native King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

Maſſacres, Rapes, Burnings, &amp;c.</hi> that followed the ſame
attempt in <hi>France,</hi> cannot be thought of, without <hi>horror</hi> and
deteſtation. Neither knew thoſe things any <hi>End,</hi> untill the
preſent <hi>forbearance,</hi> was granted. <hi>Inſtances</hi> might be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
but theſe things are knowne to all. If any ſhall ſay,
all theſe Evils followed, the attempting to ſuppreſſe Truth
not Errour, I ſhall anſwer him another time, being

            <p>6. To <hi>ſtirre</hi> us up yet further, to a ſerious conſideration of
the <hi>grounds</hi> and <hi>reaſons</hi> which are laid downe, for the inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>puniſhment</hi> upon any, for Exorbitancies in things of
Religion (upon what hath been ſaid) the perpetuall <hi>coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence</hi>
of the <hi>cauſes</hi> by them held forth, who pretend to plead
for <hi>juſt ſeverity,</hi> with their <hi>pretences</hi> who have acted <hi>unjuſt</hi>
perſecution, would be well heeded.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Poſition</hi> is laid downe in Generall on both ſides, that
<hi>Erring perſons are ſo, and ſo, to be dealt withall.</hi> That <hi>ſuch</hi> is
the power and duty of the Magiſtrate in <hi>ſuch</hi> caſes. The <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition</hi>
of Hereſie is agreed on for the maine; onely the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi>
place the <hi>Churches determination,</hi> where others thruſt in
the Hereticks conviction (a thing much more obſcure to by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders
and <hi>Judges</hi> alſo.) The appellations wherewith <hi>truth</hi>
perſecuted, and <hi>error</hi> purſued, are cloathed, ſtill the ſame.
The <hi>conſequents</hi> urged on all ſides, of <hi>diſhonour</hi> to God, <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
to the State, and the like not at all diſcrepant. The <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
for the one, and other, for the moſt part the ſame.
Looke what <hi>Reaſons</hi> one Sect gives for the puniſhing of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:165002:37"/>
the names being changed are retorted. He <hi>blaſphemeth</hi>
to the <hi>Hereticke,</hi> who chargeth <hi>blaſphemy</hi> upon him. Wee
uſe no other <hi>Arguments,</hi> cite no other <hi>Texts,</hi> preſſe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſequencies for the puniſhing of other <hi>Hereticks,</hi>
then the <hi>Papiſts</hi> the wiſeſt <hi>Hereticks</hi> breathing, doe for the
<hi>puniſhment</hi> of us.</p>
            <p>No <hi>colour,</hi> no <hi>pretence,</hi> but hath been equally uſed in all
hands: None can ſay, this is mine. To <hi>Luthers</hi> objection,
that the Church of Chriſt never burned an <hi>Hereticke,</hi> for
<hi>Huſſe,</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> were none; <hi>Bellarmine</hi> anſwers, they were
<hi>Hereticks</hi> to them <hi>Catholicks,</hi> which did ſuffice: <hi>de Laic. cap.</hi>
21. And indeed this <hi>Viciſſitude</hi> of things is very <hi>pernitious.</hi>
All Chriſtians almoſt are <hi>Hereticks</hi> to ſome enjoying <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</hi>
(as <hi>Salvian</hi> ſaid the caſe was, between the <hi>Homoouſians</hi>
and <hi>Arrians</hi> in his time) and moſt of thoſe enjoying <hi>authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
are perſwaded it is their duty, to ſuppreſſe them whom
they account <hi>Hereticks;</hi> and anſwerably have more or leſſe
acted, according to this perſwaſion, untill by blood, Wars,
and horrid <hi>devaſtations</hi> of Nations, ſome of them have been
wearied: From the firſt <hi>Cerayſado</hi> againſt the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi>
through the Warre of the <hi>Huſſites</hi> under <hi>Zifea</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copij,</hi>
thoſe dreadfull Maſſacres, before recounted, what a
ſtage of blood, hath <hi>Europe</hi> been made upon this account?
I deſire that to this <hi>point</hi> the Declaration of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi>
at the beginning of their Troubles (whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirmes
to have Petitioned for Liberty of Coſcience, as he was wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>de Haereticidio,</hi> the thing being long before granted at
<hi>Spira,</hi> at the Convention of the States of the <hi>Empire,</hi> in the
yeare 1526.) may be ſeriouſly conſidered.</p>
            <p>7. For the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of courſes of <hi>extremity,</hi> againſt <hi>erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
Perſons, for the upholding the <hi>Faith</hi> once delivered to
the Saints, and the keeping the <hi>Churches</hi> in peace, it doth
not appeare to me to be ſo urgent as is pretended; for three
hundred years, the Church had no aſſiſtance from any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
againſt <hi>Hereticks:</hi> and yet in all that ſpace, there was
not one <hi>long-lived,</hi> or farre-ſpreading Hereſie in compariſon
of <hi>thoſe</hi> that followed. As the <hi>diſeaſe</hi> is ſpirituall, ſo was the
<hi>remedy</hi> which in thoſe dayes was applyed; and the Lord
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:165002:37"/>
               <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> made it effectuall. The Chriſtians alſo of thoſe
dayes, <hi>diſclaimed</hi> all thoughts of ſuch proceedings. The <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi>
of the moſt Antient, as <hi>Policarpus, Ignatius, Iraenaeus,</hi>
concerning <hi>Hereticks</hi> are ſharpe and cutting: Their <hi>avoyding</hi>
of them being <hi>admoniſhed,</hi> preciſe and ſevere; their <hi>confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of them, laborious and diligent; their <hi>Church cenſures,</hi>
and Ejections, peircing and ſharpe: <hi>Communion amongſt the
Churches,</hi> cloſe, exact, and carefully preſerved; ſo that a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
<hi>Heretick</hi> was thruſt out of Chriſtian ſociety. But for
<hi>corporall puniſhment</hi> to be inflicted on them, in their writings,
not a ſyllable. Untill <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was changed from his firſt
reſolution and perſwaſion, by the madneſſe of <hi>Donatiſticall
Circumcellions,</hi> this Doctrine had poore footing in Antiquity.
And whether his reaſons as to this <hi>point</hi> be convincing, let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
impartiall man, read his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> 50, and determine. What
ſome ſay, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> would have been of another minde,
had they injoyed <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrates,</hi> is ſo ſuited to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<hi>frame</hi> and <hi>temper,</hi> but ſo unworthy of them, that I ſhould
wrong them by a Defenſative. What was their ſenſe of them
in a ſpirituall way is cleare. <hi>John</hi> they ſay would not abide in
a <hi>Bath,</hi> where <hi>Cerinthus</hi> the Heretick, infected wtih <hi>Juda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme</hi>
and <hi>Paganiſme</hi> was; ſaying, let us depart leſt the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

little promote the Myſterie of Iniquity: But afterwards,
when the <hi>Roman Emperours,</hi> and the <hi>Great men of the Earth,</hi>

Religion, and were mutually <hi>woed,</hi> inſtigated, and provoked
by the <hi>Parties</hi> at variance (as indeed it is a ſhame to conſider

            <p>Furthermore, by the wayes which were invented <hi>oft from

Thoſe very <hi>Lawes, Edicts,</hi> and <hi>Declarations,</hi> which were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

to obſerve,</p>
            <p>1. That the <hi>Emperours</hi> were ſtirred up to them, by <hi>Turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

that were not to be oppoſed or ſpoken againſt, when all

them the <hi>Sea,</hi> upon which the Whore exalted her <hi>ſeat</hi> and

            <p>But now,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> may ſome ſay, What will be the Iſſue of this
diſcourſe; doe you then leave every one at <hi>Liberty</hi> in the

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:165002:40"/>
of Religion,</hi> comes in the next place to be conſidered, being
the third and laſt part of our diſcourſe: Now my thoughts
unto this, I ſhall hold out under theſe three heads.</p>
            <p>1. What, is the Magiſtrates duty, as to the <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
profeſſing it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. What, in reference to the <hi>Oppoſers and Revilers of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3, What, in reſpect of <hi>Diſſenters from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I ſhall begin with the <hi>firſt,</hi> which to me, is, much of
<hi>chiefeſt</hi> importance.</p>
            <p>His <hi>power,</hi> or rather his <hi>duty</hi> herein, I ſhall hold out in
theſe enſuing <hi>Propoſitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. As all men in Generall, ſo <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> even as <hi>ſuch,</hi>
are bound to know the <hi>minde</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of God, in the things
which concerne his Honour and Worſhip. They are <hi>bound</hi> I
ſay, to know it. This <hi>obligation</hi> lyes upon all <hi>creatures,</hi> capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of knowing the <hi>Creatour,</hi> anſwerably to that <hi>light,</hi> which
of him they have, and the meanes of <hi>Revelation</hi> which they
doe enjoy. He of whom we ſpeake, is ſuppoſed to have that
<hi>moſt Soveraigne and ſupreme</hi> of all outward Teachings, <hi>the
Word of God,</hi> with ſuch other <hi>helpes,</hi> as are <hi>thereby</hi> revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and therein appointed. So as he is <hi>bound</hi> to know the
will of God, in every thing him concerning; wherein he
failes, and comes ſhort of the <hi>truth,</hi> it is his <hi>ſinne;</hi> the <hi>defect</hi>
being not in the <hi>manner</hi> of the Revelation, but in the <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of his darkened mind. Now that he is to make this <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,</hi>
in reference to his <hi>calling,</hi> is evident from that of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
2 Sam. 23. 3. He that ruleth over men muſt be juſt, ruling
in the feare of the Lord:</hi> This <hi>feare</hi> is onely taught by the <hi>Word.</hi>
Without a <hi>right knowledge</hi> of God and his mind, there can be
no <hi>true feare</hi> of him. That command alſo, for the <hi>Jewiſh
Magiſtrate,</hi> to <hi>ſtudy it day and night,</hi> and to have the <hi>Booke of
the Law</hi> continually before him, becauſe it was the Rule of
that civill <hi>Politie,</hi> whereof he was under God the head and
preſerver, by <hi>Analogy</hi> confirmeth this truth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.</p>
            <p>2. If he deſire this <hi>wiſedome</hi> ſincerely, and the Lord intend
him, <hi>as a light of the morning, as a riſing Sun, a morning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
clouds,</hi> to his people, doubtleſſe he will reveale himſelfe
to him, and teach him his mind, as he did <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:165002:41"/>
and other holy men of Old. And as to this, I ſhall one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with due <hi>reverence,</hi> cautionate the ſonnes of men, that are
exalted in <hi>Government</hi> over their Brethren, that they take
heed of <hi>a lifted up ſpirit,</hi> the greateſt <hi>cloſer</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> againſt
the truth of God. He hath promiſed, to teach the <hi>humble</hi> and
the <hi>lowly</hi> in mind; the <hi>proud</hi> he beholdeth a farre off. Is not
this the great reaſon, that the <hi>Rulers beleeve not on him,</hi> and
the <hi>Nobles lay not their necks to the yoake of the Lord,</hi> even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their <hi>hearts are lifted up within them,</hi> and ſo lye in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teachable
frame before the Lord.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>truth</hi> being revealed to them, and their owne hearts
made acquainted therewith, after their <hi>perſonall engagements,</hi>
to the practice of the power of godlineſſe, according to the
<hi>Revelation of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> three things are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
on him in reference thereunto.</p>
            <p>1. That according to the meaſure of its <hi>Revelation</hi> unto
him, he <hi>declare,</hi> or take care that <hi>it be declared</hi> unto others, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>all</hi> committed to his governing charge. The <hi>general equity,</hi>
that is in the obligation of, <hi>ſtrengthening others, when we are
confirmed, deſiring</hi> them to be <hi>like</hi> our ſelves, in all participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of grace from God, the nature of <hi>true zeale</hi> for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Name of the Lord, are a ſufficient warrant for this,
yea demand the <hi>performance</hi> of this duty. So <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inſtructed in the wayes of God, ſent <hi>Princes and Prieſts</hi>
to teach it in all the Cities and Townes of <hi>Judah, 2 Chron.</hi> 17.
8, 9, 10. As alſo did <hi>Hezekiah, 2 Chron.</hi> 30. 6, 7, 8. Let this
then be our firſt <hi>Poſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It belongs to the duty of the ſupreme Magiſtrate, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
or Shepheard of the People in any Nation, being acquainted
with the mind of God, to take care that the truth of the Goſpell be
Preached to all the people of that Nation, according to the way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
either ordinary, or extraordinary.</p>
            <p>I make no doubt but God will quickly reject them from
their <hi>power,</hi> who <hi>knowing their Maſters will,</hi> are negligent
herein.</p>
            <p>2. As he is to <hi>declare</hi> it, ſo he is to <hi>protect</hi> it from all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
whatever. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is the great <hi>King of Nations,</hi> as
well as the holy <hi>King of Saints.</hi> His Goſpell hath a <hi>right</hi> to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:165002:41"/>
be preached in <hi>every Nation,</hi> and to <hi>every creature</hi> under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Who ever forbids or hinders the free paſſage of it, is
not onely ſinfull and <hi>impious</hi> toward God, but alſo <hi>injurious</hi>
towards men. Certainly the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> is to protect every
one, and every thing, in their <hi>own right,</hi> from the <hi>violence</hi>
and injury of unruly men. In the <hi>preaching</hi> and <hi>receiving</hi> the
Goſpel, there is a <hi>right</hi> acted, ſuperior to all earthly <hi>privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi>
whatever. In this then the Magiſtrate is to protect it,
that under him the profeſſors thereof, <hi>may leade a quiet and
peaceable life, in all godlineſſe and honeſty.</hi> And for this cauſe,
they to whom the <hi>Sword</hi> is committed, may with the <hi>ſword</hi>
lawfully defend the Truth, as the <hi>undoubted right,</hi> and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
of thoſe who do enjoy it, and of which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be <hi>deprived</hi> without the greateſt injury. <hi>Jephthah</hi> layd it
down as the ground of the equity of the <hi>warres</hi> he waged
againſt the <hi>Ammonites, That they would poſſeſſe what the Lord
their God gave them to poſſeſſ;</hi> the <hi>defence</hi> whereof, he purſued
to the ſubverſion of their (at firſt) <hi>invading</hi> enemies: <hi>Judg.</hi>
11. 24. 33. (it is no new thing to <hi>begin</hi> in defence, and <hi>end</hi>
in offence). Now, if the <hi>truth</hi> be <hi>given</hi> us of the Lord our
God, to poſſeſſe, certainly it may be contended for, by thoſe
who owe <hi>protection</hi> thereunto; And if this were not ſo, we
may pray, and prevail for the proſperity of thoſe in <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi>
and yet when we have done, not have a <hi>right</hi> to <hi>a quiet
and peaceable life;</hi> Let this then be the <hi>ſecond</hi> aſſertion.</p>
            <p>The Goſpel being preached,<note place="margin">2 Poſ.</note> and declared as of right it ought to be,
it is the duty of the Magiſtrate, by the power wherewith he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted,
to protect and defend it againſt all, or any perſons, that by
force, or violence ſhall ſeek to hinder the progreſſe, or ſtop the paſſage
of it under what pretence ſoever.</p>
            <p>And that a neglect of this alſo, will be attended with the
<hi>anger</hi> of the Lord, and the kindling of his wrath, ſhall not
long be doubted of any.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>protecting, aſſiſting,</hi> and <hi>ſupporting</hi> of all the
<hi>profeſſors of it,</hi> in that <hi>profeſſion,</hi> and in wayes of truths ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
for the <hi>practice</hi> of that which is embraced, and
the <hi>furtherance</hi> of it, towards them who as yet embrace it
not, is alſo required, and of this there are ſundry parts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:165002:42"/>
1. That ſeeing Chriſt Jeſus hath appointed his <hi>diſciples</hi>
to walk in ſuch <hi>ſocieties,</hi> and requireth of them ſuch kinde
of worſhip, as cannot be performed without their meeting
together <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in one <hi>place,</hi> that he either <hi>provide,</hi> or
grant being provided, the uſe of ſuch <hi>places</hi> under his
protection, as may in all, or any kinde be <hi>ſuited,</hi> and <hi>fitted</hi>
for that <hi>end</hi> and purpoſe. And the <hi>ground</hi> of this is:</p>
            <p>1. From the Right which the <hi>Goſpel of Chriſt</hi> hath to be
received amongſt men, according to his <hi>own appointment;</hi>
whether <hi>that</hi> be the <hi>appointment</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or no, amongſt us,
is no <hi>queſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2ly, Becauſe the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> hath the <hi>ſole power</hi> of all
<hi>publick places,</hi> and the <hi>protection</hi> of them, is committed to
him alone, by virtue of that conſent into government
which is among any people. <hi>This proved as above.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2ly, A <hi>protection</hi> in the uſe of thoſe <hi>places,</hi> and all
things exerciſed in them, anſwerable to that which he <hi>doth</hi>
and is <hi>bound</hi> to grant unto men in their own <hi>private dwellings,</hi>
and families. The Reaſon why I am <hi>protected</hi> from all hurt
or <hi>violence</hi> in <hi>my family,</hi> is becauſe I have a <hi>Right</hi> to diſpoſe
of all things in my family being mine own, and ſo hath
not another; It was aſſerted before, that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have a
<hi>Right</hi> to the <hi>ordinances</hi> of Chriſt, and <hi>Truth</hi> a <hi>Right</hi> to be at
liberty. And therefore, if any ſhall <hi>invade, diſturbe,</hi> or <hi>trouble
them</hi> in their <hi>rights,</hi> and <hi>liberties,</hi> he is bound <hi>ex officio</hi> to give
them a protection, <hi>not bearing the ſword in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now being in my family, in my <hi>private houſe</hi> the aſſiſtance
of thoſe in <hi>Authority</hi> is due:
<list>
                  <item>1. In reſpect of <hi>them without.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. In reſpect of <hi>them within.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. For them without, if any <hi>one</hi> will againſt my conſent,
intrude himſelf upon my <hi>family</hi> enjoyments, to ſhare with
me, or violently come to take away that is mine, or diſtub
me in the quiet poſſeſſion of it, the Magiſtrate takes <hi>cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance</hi>
of ſuch <hi>diſturbances,</hi> and puniſheth them according to
equity. <hi>Suteably,</hi> if any <hi>perſon</hi> or <hi>perſons</hi> whatſoever, ſhall
with <hi>violence</hi> put themſelves upon the <hi>enjoyments</hi> of ſuch <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi>
as thoſe enjoying the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:165002:42"/>
to themſelves, or ſhall come in their <hi>celebration</hi> of
them, to cauſe diſturbance, certainly, that <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects
not every one in his undoubted <hi>Rights,</hi> who doth not
accommodate the wronged parties, with the <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of his
<hi>power</hi> to the puniſhment of the tranſgreſſors.</p>
            <p>2. For <hi>houſe dwellers, ſervants,</hi> or any others, who may
break out into ſuch <hi>offences,</hi> and incorrigibleneſſe, as the
amendment thereof, may be beyond what I am intruſted
to do, to any, by <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God</hi> or <hi>man,</hi> and ſhall not the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi>
here alſo interpoſe? is not his <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> here abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
required and alwayes granted?</p>
            <p>From <hi>parity of Reaſon</hi> is it not as due for their protection,
who in the enjoyment of their <hi>publick religious Rights</hi> may
receive <hi>diſturbance,</hi> and be under force, from ſome, <hi>incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
by any Rule among themſelves. For inſtance, ſuppoſe, a
<hi>perſon</hi> juſtly <hi>excommunicated,</hi> and ejected any ſociety of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
as to any ſpirituall communion, yet will with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>force</hi> and <hi>violence,</hi> put himſelf upon them in their
cloſeſt acts of communion, doubtleſſe their <hi>Rights,</hi> are here
to be by <hi>power preſerved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That whereas the <hi>Preachers of the Goſpel</hi> are now to be
<hi>maintained</hi> in an ordinarie way, and to expect their <hi>ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
in an uſnall courſe of providence, and ſeeing that <hi>many</hi>
to whom we have proved that the Goſpel is to be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
by the care of the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> will not, or cannot make
ſuch <hi>proviſions</hi> for them as is needfull, in theſe laſt evil daies
of the world, it is incumbent on thoſe <hi>nurſing Fathers,</hi> to
provide for them, who becauſe of their <hi>continuall labours</hi> in
the work of the Lord, are diſ-inabled, to make proviſion
for themſelves. Where <hi>Churches</hi> are ſetled according to the
<hi>Rule</hi> of the Goſpel, and not too much <hi>ſtraightned</hi> by <hi>reaſon</hi>
of want, there may be an <hi>alteration</hi> as to this propoſall.
That this <hi>ingagement</hi> lyes firſt upon the Churches, was ſeen
of old; Hence that caution or Canon, of the <hi>Councell of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,
cap.</hi> 6. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, let none be ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

ſaies the <hi>Scholiaſt:</hi> leſt he ſhould be driven to <hi>begge</hi> for want
of <hi>maintenance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being the ſumme of what as to this head, I have to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:165002:43"/>
               <hi>aſſert,</hi> I ſhall give in the proofs of it, and then draw ſome
further Poſitions.</p>
            <p>1. The bottome of the whole, ariſeth from that <hi>right</hi>
which the Goſpel hath to be preached to all Nations and
people, and that <hi>right</hi> paramount to all <hi>civill ſanctions</hi> and
conſtitutions, which every ſoul hath to receive it in the
profeſſion thereof. And all this flows from the <hi>donation</hi> of
the Father unto <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whereby he is <hi>made heir of all
things.</hi> Hebr. 1. 3. <hi>Having the Nations given him for his inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
the utmoſt parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion:</hi> Pſal. 2. 8. Being
alſo <hi>Lord of lords,</hi> and <hi>King of kings,</hi> acting nothing in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of his own, but what his <hi>ſoveraignty</hi> bears him
out in.</p>
            <p>2. All <hi>this</hi> tends to the <hi>apparent good,</hi> of thoſe committed
to his charge, that they may leade their lives <hi>in godlineſſe
and honeſty,</hi> which is the very <hi>chief end</hi> of <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto men. This is directly intended, all other things
come in by <hi>accident,</hi> and upon ſuppoſitions.</p>
            <p>3. No perſon living can pretend to the leaſt <hi>injury</hi> by

allowance of publick places, and the like, in the behalf of

            <p>The defence and protection of erring perſons,<note place="margin">Con: 2.</note> from violence and
injury, in thoſe things wherein they have a right, is no acting of his
duty about religious things; but a meer dealing for the preſervation
of humane ſociety, by the defence of perſons, not acting againſt the

he being to attend the worſhip which for the main is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to God in Chriſt, neither do any teſtimonies extend his duty
any further: <hi>Hence</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Corola:</hi> The preſent differences about Church ſociety, and the

are known by the names of Presbyterians, and Independents, as they
are in themſelves (not heightned by the prejudices, luſts, corruptions,
and intereſts of men) hinder not at all, but that the Magiſtrate is
bound to the performance of the duties before mentioned unto both
parties. <hi>And the Reaſons of this are, becauſe</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The things wherein they are agreed, are clearly as
<hi>broad,</hi> as the Magiſtrates duty can be <hi>ſtretched to cover</hi> them.</p>
            <p>2. Neither <hi>party</hi> (I am perſwaded) in their retyred
thoughts, dare avow the <hi>main</hi> of the worſhip by their <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi>
embraced, to be <hi>as ſuch,</hi> rejected of the Lord.</p>
            <p>3. No <hi>example</hi> in the world, can be produced out of the
<hi>old</hi> Teſtament, or <hi>New,</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory,</hi> of a forcible
<hi>deciſion</hi> of ſuch minute differences. See <hi>Socrat: Eccleſ. Hiſt. lib.

2. <hi>Corol:</hi> All the plea of perſons erring in doctrine or worſhip,

            <p>And this for the <hi>firſt</hi> part ſhall ſuffice.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is <hi>another part</hi> of the Magiſtrates power,
the <hi>other ſide</hi> of his ſword to be exerciſed towards the <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi>
of that <hi>truth</hi> which he hath embraced: and this hath
a twofold object.</p>

                     <item>2. Outward Appearances, Monuments, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations
and Declarations of thoſe
wayes. <hi>Of the</hi> firſt, <hi>I ſhall ſpeak after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi>

                  </list>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>By the <hi>ſecond,</hi> I mean, all the <hi>outward attendencies</hi> of any
falſe or erronious worſhip, which are either <hi>helps</hi> to, or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations</hi>
of the ſuperſtition, idolatry, error, or falſeneſſe of
it; as <hi>Temple</hi> for idolatrous ſervice, <hi>Croſſes, pictures,</hi> and the
like abuſed <hi>Relicks</hi> of old unwarranted zeal.</p>
            <p>Now concerning theſe, I affirm.</p>
            <p>1. That the Magiſtrate ought not to make <hi>proviſion</hi> of
any <hi>publick places</hi> for the practiſe of any ſuch <hi>worſhip</hi> as he
is <hi>convinced</hi> to be an abomination unto the Lord. When I
ſay he ought not to make <hi>proviſion,</hi> I underſtand, not onely
<hi>a not actuall caring</hi> that ſuch be, but alſo a caring that <hi>ſuch
may not</hi> be. He ſhould not have a <hi>negation</hi> of acting as to any
thing of <hi>publick</hi> concernment. His not oppoſing, here is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding.
For inſtance; He muſt not allow, that is, it is his
duty to oppoſe, the ſetting apart of <hi>publick places,</hi> under his
protection for the ſervice of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> (as of late in <hi>Sommer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet
Houſe</hi>) or for any kinde of worſhip <hi>in it ſelf diſallowed,</hi>
becauſe <hi>not required,</hi> and ſo, not <hi>accepted.</hi> This were to be
bound to help forward <hi>ſin,</hi> and that ſuch <hi>ſin</hi> whereof he is
<hi>convinced,</hi> which is repugnant to the whole <hi>revealed</hi> will of
God. A <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> I told you before, is not to act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to what he <hi>may</hi> do, but what he <hi>muſt</hi> do: Now it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be his duty to further ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:165002:44"/>
2. Outward <hi>monuments,</hi> wayes of declaring and holding
out <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>idolatrous</hi> worſhip, he is to <hi>remove:</hi> as the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
Images, Altars, Pictures, and the like, <hi>Turks Moſckes, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates</hi>
Service book. Now theſe are of two ſorts.</p>
            <p>1. Such things as in their <hi>whole uſe and nature,</hi> ſerve one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the carrying on of worſhip, in it ſelf wholly falſe, and
meerly <hi>invented.</hi> As <hi>Altars, Images, Croſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Such as were uſed for the carrying on of <hi>worſhip true</hi>
in it ſelf, though vilely corrupted, as praying, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
ſuch are thoſe places commonly called, <hi>Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> are to be <hi>aboliſhed,</hi> the <hi>latter</hi> aright uſed. (I
ſpeak as to publick appearances, for private diſquiſitions
after ſuch things, I may be otherwiſe minded.) The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of this <hi>difference,</hi> is evident to all.</p>
            <p>Thus in dayes of old, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſhut up <hi>Pagans Temples:
Euſeb. de vita Conſtant. lib. 4. cap.</hi> 23, 24. and demoliſhed ſome
of the moſt filthy of them: <hi>lib. 3. cap. 52. Theodoſius</hi> utterly
caſt them to the ground, though not without ſome <hi>blows

12. 1, 2, 3. with the commendation of thoſe <hi>Kings of Judah</hi>
who accordingly performed this duty, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 6. and
30. 14. are enough to confirm it, and to bottome <hi>this Poſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the duty of the Magiſtrate not to allow any publick places
for (in his judgement) falſe and abominable worſhip,<note place="margin">6 Poſ.</note> as alſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh
all outward appearances and demonſtrations of ſuch ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions,
idolatrous and unacceptable ſervice.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Papiſts</hi> who are <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> who are <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropolatrae,</hi>
plead for themſelves.</p>
            <p>Now ſecondly for <hi>perſons,</hi> there ſeems ſomething more of
<hi>difficulty,</hi> yet certain clear <hi>rules</hi> may be propoſed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them alſo, to hold out when they and their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
come under the cognizance of the <hi>Civill Magiſtrate,</hi> and
are obnoxious to the ſword which he beareth. And they
are theſe.</p>
            <p>1. Such <hi>perſons,</hi> as having embraced any falſe <hi>principles
and perſwaſion</hi> in, or about things concerning <hi>God</hi> and his
<hi>worſhip,</hi> do purſue the upholding or <hi>propagating</hi> of ſuch
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:165002:45"/>
               <hi>principles,</hi> in a diſorderly manner to the diſturbance of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
ſociety, are doubtleſſe under his <hi>reſtraining power,</hi> to be
acted and put forth in ſuch wayes as to other perſons, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
out into the <hi>ſame,</hi> or the <hi>like</hi> compaſſe of diſorder, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
other <hi>grounds,</hi> and from the inſtigation of other <hi>luſts.</hi>
The <hi>pretence of diſturbance and confuſion</hi> upon the <hi>bearing</hi> with
differences in opinion about things commanded in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
we before rejected as a <hi>colour</hi> fitted chiefly for the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
of perſecution. But actuall <hi>diſturbances</hi> indeed, muſt
have actuall <hi>reſtraints.</hi> For inſtance; If a man being perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that the power of the Magiſtrate, is in Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
groundleſſe, unwarrantable, unlawfull, ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ſtir up the <hi>people</hi> to the aboliſhing, and removall of
that <hi>power,</hi> ſuch <hi>ſtirrings up,</hi> and ſuch <hi>actings</hi> upon that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation,
are, <hi>as</hi> oppoſite to the Goſpel of Chriſt (which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
no lawfull regiment among the ſons of men) ſo alſo
<hi>prejudiciall</hi> to humane ſociety, and therefore to be proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt by them who bear not the ſword in vain. This
<hi>caſe</hi> we know happened once in <hi>Germany,</hi> and may do ſo
again in other places. If ſuch as theſe ſuffer, it is as <hi>murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
or theeves, or evill doers, or buſie-bodies in other mens mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi>
which is a ſhamefull thing, no way commendable or
praiſe worthy. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
            <p>2. If any <hi>perſons</hi> whatſoever, under any <hi>pretence</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
ſhall offer <hi>violence</hi> or diſturbance to the <hi>profeſſors</hi> of the
true worſhip of God, ſo owned, eſtabliſhed, and confirmed
as <hi>above</hi> ſaid, in, and for the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of that true, ſo <hi>owned</hi>
worſhip, ſervice and declaration of the minde of God, <hi>ſuch
perſons</hi> are to feare that power, which is <hi>the miniſter of God,
and a revenger to them that do evill.</hi> Let us <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> of them, what
they ſuppoſe, and for their own <hi>juſtification and ſupport</hi> in ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular
wayes, bear out of themſelves, that they enjoy the
truth, others walking in paths of their own; yet then, this
practiſe is contrary to that <hi>prime dictate of nature,</hi> which
none can pretend ignorance of, <hi>viz: Do not that to another,
which thou wouldeſt not have done unto thy ſelf;</hi> If men that
would not think <hi>it equitable</hi> to be ſo <hi>dealt</hi> with, as they <hi>deal</hi>
with others, ſuppoſing themſelves in their conditions, do
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:165002:45"/>
yet ſo deal with them, they are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
ſentence againſt themſelves, out of their own
mouthes. This then deſerveth <hi>puniſhment,</hi> and breaking out
to the diſturbance of <hi>publick order,</hi> ought to be puniſhed. We
before proved the protection <hi>of publick places</hi> to belong to
the Magiſtrate: ſo that he not onely may, but if he will not
be falſe to him by whom he is intruſted, he muſt put forth
his Authority for <hi>the ſafe guarding</hi> and revenging of them.
Yea alſo and this rule may paſſe, when ſome things in the
way publickly eſtabliſhed, are truly offenſive. What the
ancient Chriſtians thought of the zeal of <hi>Audas</hi> a Chriſtian
Biſhop, who would needs demoliſh a <hi>Pagan Temple</hi> in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi>
I know not, but I am ſure his diſcretion is not much
extolled, who by that one <hi>fiery</hi> act of deſtroying <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or
Temple of ſlain, occaſioned a cruell <hi>perſecution</hi> of 30. yeers
continuance. <hi>Theod. Eccleſ. Hiſt. lib. 5. cap.</hi> 139.</p>
            <p>3. When any have entertained any <hi>ſingular opinion,</hi> in
matters of great <hi>weight and importance,</hi> ſuch as <hi>neerly</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the glory of God, and the minds of Chriſtians in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
of his holy name, are moſt <hi>tenderly</hi> affected withall,
ſo that without much <hi>horror</hi> of minde, they can ſcarſe hear
thoſe errors, whereby thoſe grand truths are oppoſed, yet
thoſe perſons, who have entertained ſuch uncouth opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſhall not be content, <hi>ſo to have done,</hi> and alſo in all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
wayes (as to civill ſociety) endeavoured to <hi>propagate</hi>
the ſaid <hi>opinions</hi> to others, but in the purſuit of this their
<hi>deſigne</hi> of oppoſing truth, ſhall <hi>publickly</hi> uſe ſuch expreſſions,
or perform ſuch acts, as are fit to powre <hi>contempt and ſcorn</hi>
upon the truth which they do oppoſe, reviling <hi>it</hi> alſo, or
<hi>God</hi> himſelf ſo repreſented, as he is in the truth they abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate,
with odious and execrable appellations, (as for
inſtance, the calling the holy Trinity, <hi>Tricipitem Cerberum</hi>)
if the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ueſtion be put, whether in this caſe the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi>
be not obliged to vindicate the honour of God, by <hi>corporall
reſtraints,</hi> in ſome degrees at leaſt upon the <hi>perſons</hi> of thoſe
men, truly for my part, I incline to the <hi>affirmative.</hi> And the
Reaſon hereof is this; Though men, through the <hi>incurable
blindneſſe</hi> of their minds, falling into <hi>error</hi> of judgement,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:165002:46"/>
and <hi>miſ-interpretation</hi> of the Word, may diſ-beleeve the
Deitie of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> yet that any <hi>pretence</hi> from
the Word, <hi>perſwaſion</hi> of conſcience, or <hi>dictate</hi> of Religion,
ſhould carrie them out to <hi>reviling opprobrious ſpeeches</hi> of <hi>that,</hi>
which of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is held out contrary to their <hi>apprehenſions,</hi>
is falſe and remote from <hi>Reaſon</hi> it ſelf. For this cauſe <hi>Paul</hi>
ſaies he was a <hi>blaſphemer,</hi> not becauſe being a Jew, he diſ-beleeved
the Goſpel, but becauſe ſo diſ-beleeving it, he
moreover loaded the <hi>truths</hi> thereof, with <hi>contumelious</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.
Such <hi>expreſſions</hi> indeed differ not from thoſe <hi>pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi>
words of the holy name of God which he cenſured to
death: <hi>Levit.</hi> 24. 15. but onely in this, that there ſeemeth in
<hi>that</hi> to be a plain oppoſition unto <hi>light,</hi> in this not ſo. The
like may be ſaid of a Jew's crucifying a dogge.</p>
            <p>4. There are a ſort of perſons termed in Scripture, <gap reason="foreign">

1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. and the like, diſorderly; vagabond, wandring,
irregular perſons, fixed to no <hi>calling,</hi> abiding in no <hi>place,</hi>
taking no care of their <hi>families,</hi> that under a <hi>pretence</hi> of
teaching the <hi>truth,</hi> without <hi>miſſion,</hi> without <hi>call,</hi> without
<hi>warrant,</hi> uncommanded, undeſired, do go up and down,
from place to place, <hi>creeping into houſes,</hi> &amp;c. Now that ſuch
<hi>wayes</hi> as theſe, and <hi>perſons</hi> in theſe wayes, may be <hi>judicially</hi>
inquired into, I no way doubt. The ſtory is famous of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtris</hi>
King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who made a <hi>Law,</hi> that all the Subjects
of his kingdom, ſhould once a yeer give an account of their
way and manner of living, and if any one were found to
ſpend his time <hi>idly,</hi> he was certainly puniſhed; and the
Laws of moſt <hi>Nations</hi> have provided that their people ſhall
not be <hi>wanderers,</hi> and whoſoever hath not a place of abode,
and imployment, is by them a <hi>puniſhable vagabond.</hi> And in
this by much experience of the <hi>wayes,</hi> walking and converſe
of ſuch perſons, I am exceedingly confirmed in. I did as
yet never obſerve any other iſſue upon ſuch <hi>undertakings,</hi>
but ſcandall to Religion, and trouble to men in <hi>their civill</hi>
relations.</p>
            <p>5. When men by the <hi>practiſe</hi> of any <hi>vice</hi> or ſin, draw
others to a pretended <hi>Religion,</hi> or by pretence of <hi>Religion</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:165002:46"/>
draw men to any <hi>vice</hi> or known ſin, let them be twice pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
for their reall <hi>vice,</hi> and <hi>pretended</hi> Religion. The truth
is, I have been taught exceedingly to diſ-beleeve all the
ſtrange <hi>imputations</hi> of wickedneſſe and uncleanneſſe, that
are impoſed upon many, to be <hi>either the end</hi> or the <hi>medium</hi>
of the practiſe of that <hi>communion</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> which they do
profeſſe and imbrace: I remember that when I was a boy,
all thoſe <hi>ſtories</hi> were told me of <hi>Browniſts and Puritans,</hi> which
afterward, I found it to have been long before, the forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of <hi>Pagans,</hi> and impoſed on the <hi>primitive</hi> Chriſtians. I
dare boldly ſay I have heard <hi>ſtories</hi> of them an hundred
times, holding out that <hi>very thing,</hi> and thoſe deeds of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> holds out in the tongue of an
<hi>Infidel</hi> concerning the Chriſtians of thoſe dayes; but yet
becauſe ſundrie <hi>venerable perſons</hi> to whom Antiquity hath
given <hi>ſanctuary</hi> from being arraigned in the point of falſe
teſtimony, have left it upon record of ſundry <hi>Hereticks</hi> in
their dayes, as the (<hi>Gnoſticks</hi> &amp; others) that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
into <hi>ſocieties teſſera pollutionis,</hi> and ſome aſſert that
the like <hi>iniquities</hi> are not wholly buried, I made the <hi>ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi>
and hope that if they <hi>depoſe</hi> themſelves from <hi>common
ſence and reaſon,</hi> the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> will never exalt them to the
priviledge and exemption of Religion.</p>
            <p>In theſe, and ſuch like <hi>eaſes</hi> as theſe, when men ſhall
break forth into <hi>diſturbance</hi> of common order and enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
againſt the <hi>light of nature,</hi> beyond all poſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of any pretended Religion whatſoever, that the
Magiſtrate ought to ſet <hi>hedges</hi> of thornes in their wayes,
ſharpned according to their ſeverall delinquencies; I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
no man not abhord of <hi>common ſenſe,</hi> can once heſitate
or doubt. And I am the more inclin'd to aſſert a <hi>reſtraint</hi>
to all <hi>ſuch</hi> as theſe, becauſe it may be eſtabliſhed to the
<hi>height,</hi> without the leaſt prejudice unto the <hi>truth,</hi> though
<hi>perſons erring</hi> ſhould injoy the place of authority.</p>
            <p>That which now remaineth in this <hi>head,</hi> to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is concerning perſons <hi>maintaining</hi> and upholding any
great and <hi>pernicious</hi> errors, but in <hi>ſuch</hi> wayes, as are not by
any of the former <hi>diſorders</hi> to be brought under the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:165002:47"/>
of the <hi>Civill Magiſtrate,</hi> but <hi>good, honeſt, allowable,</hi> and
peaceable in themſelves, not at all to be queſtioned, but in
reference to the things that are carried on,—in and by
thoſe wayes; as <hi>communication</hi> by diſcourſe, and <hi>private
preaching,</hi> and the like. Now concerning theſe, it is <hi>generally</hi>
affirmed, that perſons maintaining any <hi>error</hi> in or againſt
any <hi>fundamentall Article</hi> of faith, or Religion, and that with
obſtinacy or pertinacie, after conviction, ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
againſt, by the authority of the civill <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi>
whether unto <hi>death or baniſhment, impriſonment or confiſcation
of goods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now unto this, ſuppoſing, what I have written <hi>heretofore,</hi>
concerning the <hi>incompetency</hi> of <hi>all,</hi> and the <hi>non-conſtitution</hi> of
any <hi>Judge</hi> in this caſe, with the Anſwers—given at the
beginning of this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> to the moſt of the places, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
uſually for the affirmative, reſerving the conſideration
of preſſing <hi>conformity</hi> to the next head, to be handled: I ſhall
briefly give in my thoughts: and,</p>
            <p>1. That I cannot but obſerve, that in the <hi>queſtion</hi> it ſelf,
there are ſundry things, <hi>gratis</hi> aſſumed: as,</p>
            <p>1. That it is <hi>known</hi> and confeſſed, what Articles in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
are <hi>fundamentall;</hi> and this alſo to the Magiſtrate:
when no one thing among <hi>Chriſtians</hi> is more <hi>queſtionable;</hi>
moſt accounting them ſo, (be they what they will) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they differ from others. So that one way or other, all <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi>
ſhall be hooked in, <hi>directly</hi> or <hi>indirectly</hi> to <hi>claſh</hi> upon
fundamentals. In this, <hi>Papiſts</hi> are ſecure, who make the
<hi>Churches</hi> Propoſitions ſufficient to make an <hi>Article</hi> funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall.</p>
            <p>2. That the <hi>perſons</hi> holding the error are <hi>convinced,</hi> when
perhaps they have been onely <hi>confuted:</hi> between which two
there is a wide <hi>difference;</hi> he that holds the truth may be
confuted, but a man cannot be <hi>convinced</hi> but by the truth.
That a man ſhould be ſaid to be <hi>convinced</hi> of a <hi>truth,</hi> and
yet that truth not ſhine in upon his <hi>underſtanding,</hi> to the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling</hi>
of the contrary error, to me is ſtrange. To be <hi>convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,</hi>
is to be over-powred by the <hi>evidence</hi> of that, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a man knew not; I my ſelf, once knew a <hi>Scholer</hi> invited
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:165002:47"/>
to a <hi>Diſpute</hi> with another man, about ſomething in <hi>contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie</hi>
in Religion; in his own, and in the judgement of all
the by-ſtanders the oppoſing perſon was utterly confuted:
and yet the <hi>Scholer</hi> within a few <hi>months,</hi> taught of God, and
clearly <hi>convinced,</hi> that it was an error which he had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and the <hi>truth</hi> which he oppoſed. And then, and not
<hi>till then,</hi> did he ceaſe to <hi>wonder,</hi> that the other perſon was
not <hi>convinced</hi> by his ſtrong <hi>Arguments,</hi> as before he had
thought. May not a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> be really worſted in a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
by a <hi>Papiſt?</hi> hath it not ſo ere now fallen out? If not,
the <hi>Jeſuites are egregious lyars.</hi> To ſay a man is convinced,
when either for want of <hi>skill,</hi> and <hi>ability,</hi> or the <hi>like,</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
maintain his <hi>opinion,</hi> to, and againſt, <hi>all men,</hi> is meer
conceit. The <hi>truth</hi> is, I am ſo far from this <hi>moroſe</hi> ſeveritie
of looking upon all erring perſons as <hi>convinced,</hi> that have
been <hi>confuted,</hi> that I rather in <hi>charity</hi> incline to beleeve, that
no erring perſon whileſt he <hi>continues</hi> in his error, is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
It will not eaſily enter into my <hi>dull</hi> apprehenſion, how
a man can be <hi>convinced</hi> of an <hi>error</hi> (that is enlightned with
a contrary truth) and yet hold that <hi>error</hi> ſtill: I am loth to
charge more <hi>corrupt and vile affections</hi> upon any, then do
openly appear; That of <hi>Paul</hi> affirming that ſome men are
<hi>ſelf-condemned,</hi> is quite of another nature: I think a perſon
is ſaid to be <hi>convinced,</hi> not when there is a <hi>ſufficiency</hi> in the
means of conviction, but when there is ſuch an <hi>efficacy</hi> in
them, as to <hi>lay hold</hi> upon his underſtanding.</p>
            <p>5. That they are <hi>obſtinate</hi> and <hi>pertinacious</hi> is alſo a <hi>cheap
ſuppoſall,</hi> taken up without the <hi>price</hi> of a proof. What we
call <hi>obſtinacy,</hi> they call <hi>conſtancy:</hi> and what we condemne
them for, as <hi>pertinacy,</hi> they embrace as <hi>perſeverance:</hi> as the
<hi>conviction</hi> is <hi>impoſed,</hi> not <hi>owned,</hi> ſo is this <hi>obſtinacy,</hi> if we may
be <hi>judges</hi> of other mens <hi>obſtinacy,</hi> all will be plain: but if
ever they get <hi>uppermoſt,</hi> they will be <hi>judges</hi> of ours: Beſides,
I know not what <hi>good</hi> it will do us, or how it will <hi>advantage</hi>
our cauſe, to ſuppoſe men <hi>obſtinate</hi> and convinced before
we puniſh them: no ſuch <hi>qualifications</hi> being any where in
the book of God <hi>urged</hi> in perſons deſerving puniſhment: if
they have committed the <hi>crime,</hi> whereunto the <hi>penalty</hi> is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:165002:48"/>
annexed, be they <hi>obſtinate</hi> or not, they ſhall be puniſhed.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>ſuppoſing</hi> all this, that we are clear in all <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals</hi>
that we are <hi>convinced,</hi> that they are <hi>convinced,</hi> and
doubt not but that they are <hi>obſtinate,</hi> if they keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the former bounds, what is to be done? I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
what we ſpake at the entrance of this <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> I ſhall
as to any wayes of <hi>corporall coaction</hi> and reſtraint, oppoſe
ſome few things.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>non-conſtitution</hi> of a <hi>Judge</hi> in caſe of <hi>hereſie,</hi> as a
thing civilly <hi>criminall.</hi> As to <hi>ſpirituall cenſures</hi> and an Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
judgement of errors, and falſe doctrines, we finde
them appointed, and a <hi>lawfull Judge</hi> as to the determining
concerning them, divinely inſtituted: ſo that in ſuch <hi>wayes,</hi>
they may be warrantably proceeded againſt. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 3.
But now, for any <hi>Judge</hi> that ſhould make <hi>diſquiſition</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them, or proceed againſt them as things <hi>criminall,</hi>
to be puniſhed with civill cenſures, I conceive the <hi>Scripture</hi>
is ſilent: And indeed, who ſhould it be? The <hi>cuſtome</hi> of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ages was, that <hi>ſome perſons</hi> of one ſort, ſhould determine
of it as to <hi>right, viz:</hi> that <hi>ſuch</hi> or ſuch a thing, was <hi>hereſie,</hi>
and ſuch or ſuch a one, an <hi>Heretick,</hi> (which was the work
of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Prelates</hi>) and <hi>perſons</hi> of another ſort, ſhould
<hi>de facto</hi> puniſh, and determine to be puniſhed, <hi>thoſe,</hi> ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
by the former: and theſe were as they called them
the <hi>ſecular Magiſtrates,</hi> officers of this <hi>world.</hi> And indeed,
had not the <hi>God of this world</hi> blinded their eyes, and the <hi>God
of the ſpirits of all fleſh</hi> hardened their hearts, they would
not have ſo <hi>given up</hi> their power, to the <hi>Man of ſin</hi> as to be
made ſo <hi>ſordidly</hi> inſtrumentall to his <hi>bloody</hi> cruelty: We read
<hi>Jer.</hi> 26. 10, 11. that the <hi>Prieſts and Prophets aſſemble themſelves
in judgement,</hi> and ſo pronounce <hi>ſentence</hi> upon the Prophet
<hi>Jeremy</hi> that he ſhould <hi>dye</hi> for a falſe Prophet, <hi>v. 12. Jeremy</hi>
makes his appeal to the <hi>ſecular Magiſtrate</hi> and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who taking <hi>cognizance</hi> of the cauſe, pronounce ſentence
in the behalf of the condemned perſon, againſt the <hi>Prieſts</hi>
and Prophets, and deliver him whether they will or not,
<hi>v.</hi> 16. I ſpare the Application of the ſtory: but that <hi>Princes</hi>
and <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> ſhould without cognizance of the <hi>thing,</hi> or
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:165002:48"/>
               <hi>cauſe,</hi> proceed to <hi>puniſhment</hi> or cenſure of it, upon the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> condemning ſuch or ſuch a man for an
<hi>heretick,</hi> or a falſe prophet, <hi>bleſſed be the Lord,</hi> we have no
warrant: Had this <hi>proceeding</hi> been regular, <hi>Jeremy</hi> had dyed
without mercy for a falſe prophet, as <hi>thouſands</hi> ſince, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before the Lord in his ſpirit have done. This courſe
then, that the <hi>civill Magiſtrate</hi> ſhould proceed to <hi>ſentence</hi> of
corporall puniſhment, upon others <hi>judging</hi> of the fault, is
<hi>vile, ſordid, unwarrantable,</hi> and exceedingly unworthy of any
rationall man, much more ſuch as are ſet over the people
of the Land: that the ſame perſons muſt <hi>determine</hi> of the
<hi>cauſe,</hi> and appoint the puniſhment is clear: Now who muſt
theſe be? are they the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel? of all others,
they are the moſt likely to be the moſt <hi>competent</hi> Judges in
ſpirituall cauſes: let it then be ſo; but then alſo, they muſt
be the <hi>determiners</hi> and inflicters of the <hi>puniſhment</hi> upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault:
now let them powre out upon <hi>obſtinately erring perſons,</hi>
all the <hi>vengeance,</hi> that God hath betruſted them withall.
<hi>The weapons of our warfare are not carnall, but mighty through
God,</hi> &amp;c. By this courſe, <hi>Admonition, Avoiding, Rejection,
Excommunication,</hi> will be the utmoſt that can be inflicted on
them: which for my part I deſire may be exerciſed to the
utmoſt extent of the rule.<note place="margin">Of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> 2ly, ſhall the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> be made
Judge of the <hi>cauſe,</hi> as well as of the <hi>perſon?</hi> is he entruſted
to determine, what is <hi>error,</hi> what not; what <hi>hereſie,</hi> what
not; who is an <hi>Heretick,</hi> who not; and ſo what <hi>puniſhment</hi>
is due to ſuch, and ſuch errors, according to the <hi>degrees,</hi>
wherein they are? Why firſt, I deſire an inſtitution of this
<hi>ordinance</hi> in the Church? where is the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> entruſted
with ſuch a power? where are <hi>rules</hi> preſcribed to him, in
his proceedings? 2ly, is not a <hi>judiciary determination</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
truth and error (I mean truths of the Goſpel) a
meer <hi>Chruch act?</hi> and that <hi>Church power,</hi> whereby it is effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
muſt not then the Magiſtrate <hi>quâ talis</hi> be a Church of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer?
will men of this minde, tolerate <hi>Eraſtianiſme?</hi> 3ly, if
there be a twofold <hi>judicature</hi> appointed for the ſame <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
for the ſame <hi>crime,</hi> is it not becauſe <hi>one crime</hi> may in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
reſpects fall under ſeverall conſiderations? and muſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:165002:49"/>
not theſe <hi>conſiderations</hi> be preſerved <hi>immixed,</hi> that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
reaſon of proceeding in one <hi>Court,</hi> may not be of any
<hi>weight</hi> in the other? We proved before, and it is granted of
all, that the <hi>Church</hi> is <hi>Judge</hi> in caſe of <hi>hereſie</hi> and error, as
ſuch, to proceed againſt them, as contrary to the Goſpel;
their <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the faith delivered to the Saints, is the
formall reaſon upon which that proceedeth to cenſure: if
now <hi>this</hi> be afterwards brought under another <hi>ſentence,</hi> of
another <hi>Judicature,</hi> muſt it not be under another conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?
Now what can this be, but its <hi>diſturbance</hi> of civill
ſociety, which when it doth ſo, not in <hi>pretence,</hi> but <hi>really</hi> and
actually, none denyes it to be the Magiſtrates <hi>duty</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
with his power. 4ly, if the Magiſtrate be <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
offences,</hi> and it be left to him to determine, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
judgement in ſuch <hi>proportion,</hi> as he ſhall think meet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the qualitie and degrees thereof; it is a very
ſtrange and unlimited <hi>arbitrarineſſe</hi> over the lives &amp; eſtates
of men: and ſurely they ought to produce very clear <hi>teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi>
that they are entruſted from the Lord <hi>herewith,</hi> or
they can have no great <hi>quiet</hi> in acting. 5ly, it ſeems ſtrange
to me, that the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould commit this <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techtonicall</hi>
power in his houſe, unto Magiſtrates, foreſeeing
of what ſort the <hi>greatest number</hi> of them would be, yea <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining</hi>
that they ſhould be ſuch, for the tryall and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
of his own. View the times that are <hi>paſt,</hi> conſult
the ſtories of <hi>former ages,</hi> take a <hi>catalogue</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> and
<hi>Rulers</hi> that have been, ſince firſt Magiſtrates outwardly
embraced <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> in this, and other Nations,
where the Goſpel hath been planted, and ask your own
<hi>conſciences</hi> whether <hi>theſe be the men,</hi> to whom this high truſt
in the houſe of God is committed. The truth is, they no
ſooner left ſerving the <hi>Dragon</hi> in the perſecution of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
but preſently in a very few yeers, they gave up their
power to the <hi>beaſt,</hi> to ſet up another State in oppoſition to
the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his Goſpel: in the ſupportment
whereof, the moſt of them continue labouring till this very
day. <hi>Hae manus Trojam exigent?</hi> What may be added in this
caſe, I refer to another opportunity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:165002:49"/>
2. Goſpel <hi>conſtitutions</hi> in the caſe of <hi>hereſie</hi> or error, ſeems
not to favour any courſe of violence; I mean of civil penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Foretold it is, that <hi>hereſies</hi> muſt be, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 19. but this,
for the <hi>manifeſting of thoſe that are approved,</hi> not the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thoſe that are not; I ſay deſtroying, I mean with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<hi>puniſhment,</hi> that I may adde this by the way; for all
the <hi>arguments</hi> produced for the puniſhment of <hi>hereticks,</hi>
holding out <hi>capitall cenſures,</hi> and theſe being the tendance
of all beginnings in this kinde, I mention onely the <hi>greateſt,</hi>
including all other <hi>arbitrary penalties,</hi> being but ſteps of
walking to the utmoſt cenſures. Admonitions, and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
upon rejection of admonition, are the higheſt
conſtitutions (I ſuppoſe) againſt ſuch perſons: <hi>Waiting
with all patience upon them that oppoſe themſelves, if at any time
God will give them repentance to the acknowledgement of the truth:</hi>
impriſoning, baniſhing, ſlaying is ſcarcely a <hi>patient wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
God doth not ſo wait upon unbeleevers. Perhaps thoſe,
who call for the <hi>ſword</hi> on earth are as unacquainted with
their own ſpirits, as thoſe that called for <hi>fire</hi> from heaven,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 11. And perhaps the <hi>parable</hi> of the <hi>tares</hi> gives in a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive
rule as to this whole buſineſſe: occaſion may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of handling it at large: for the preſent I ſhall not fear
to aſſert, that the <hi>anſwers</hi> unto it, borrowed by our <hi>Divines</hi>
from <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> will not endure the triall: we hope that
ſpirituall quiet, and inoffenſiveneſſe <hi>in the whole mountain of
the Lord,</hi> which is wrapt up in the wombe of many promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
will at length be brought forth to the joy of all the
children of Sion.</p>
            <p>3. Sundrie other arguments taken from the nature of
faith, hereſie, liberty of Conſcience, the way of illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
means of communication of truth, nature of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
things, pravitious tendence of the doctrine oppoſed, if
it ſhould be actually embraced by all enjoying authority,
and the like; I thought at preſent to have added, but I am
gone already beyond my purpoſed reſting place.</p>
            <p>Come we in a few words to the <hi>laſt thing</hi> propoſed
(wherein I ſhall be very brief, the main of what I intended,
being already ſet down) the <hi>power</hi> of the Magiſtrate to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:165002:50"/>
compell others, to the embracing of that <hi>Religion</hi> and way
of worſhip, which he ſhall eſtabliſh and ſet up, which for
the <hi>greater advantage</hi> we ſhall ſuppoſe to be the very ſame,
both for the things propoſed to be <hi>beleeved,</hi> and alſo <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi>
which God himſelf hath <hi>revealed,</hi> and requireth all men
every where to embrace. What is to be done, for the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and <hi>eſtabliſhing</hi> of the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of the Goſpel, and the
right <hi>apprehenſion</hi> of the minde of God therein, contra-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from all thoſe <hi>falſe and erronious perſwaſions,</hi> which in
theſe, or former dayes are, or have been held forth in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
thereunto, was before declared; how it is to be
<hi>ſupported, maintained, protected, defended, ſafe-guarded,</hi> from all
oppoſitions, diſturbances, blaſphemings, was then, and
there ſet down.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſing, that <hi>ſundry perſons</hi> living under the <hi>power</hi>
and <hi>owning</hi> civill obedience to the Magiſtrate, will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to <hi>ſound doctrine,</hi> nor receive, in <hi>ſome</hi> things, (<hi>fewer</hi> or
<hi>more, leſſe,</hi> or <hi>greater),</hi> that <hi>form of wholſome words,</hi> which he
holds forth, and owns as the minde of Chriſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
nor <hi>communicate</hi> with him, in the worſhip, which by
the Authority of thoſe words, or that truth, he hath as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
eſtabliſhed, it is inquired what is the <hi>duty</hi> of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
in reference to the bringing of them into that <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi>
which is due unto, and acknowledgement of, the
truth; And to this I ſhall briefly give in my Anſwer in theſe
following Poſitions.</p>
            <p>1. In reference unto <hi>us,</hi> in this <hi>Nation,</hi> the greateſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in giving a full return to this <hi>queſtion,</hi> ariſeth from
the great <hi>diſorder</hi> of the Churches of God amongſt us: were
the <hi>precious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>vile,</hi> Churches <hi>rightly</hi>
eſtabliſhed, and Church diſcipline exerciſed, that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were under ſome orderly <hi>view,</hi> and men might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidered,
in their ſeverall <hi>capacities</hi> wherein they ſtand, an
<hi>eaſie finger</hi> would unty the <hi>knot</hi> of this <hi>quaere;</hi> but being in
that <hi>confuſion,</hi> wherein we are, gathering into <hi>any order</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great work in hand, I ſuppoſe under favour, that
the time is <hi>ſcarce come,</hi> for the propoſall of this queſtion:
but yet ſomething may be given in unto it though not ſo
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:165002:50"/>
clear, as the former ſuppoſall being effected, would cauſe
it to be.</p>
            <p>2. The conſtant practiſe of the <hi>Churches</hi> in former ages,
in all their meetings for adviſe and counſell, to conſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſome form of wholſome words, that might be a diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
<hi>teſſera</hi> of their <hi>communion</hi> in doctrine, being uſed
in prime Antiquitie, as is manifeſt in that <hi>ancient Symbol</hi>
commonly eſteemed <hi>Apoſtolicall,</hi> of the chief heads whereof
mention in the like Summary is made in the very firſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
among them, having alſo warrant from the Word of
God, and being of <hi>ſingular uſe</hi> to hold out unto all other
<hi>Churches</hi> of the world, our apprehenſions of the minde of
God, in the chief heads of Religion) may be conſidered: If
this be done by the authority of the Magiſtrate, I mean if
ſuch a declaration of the truth, wherein the <hi>Churches</hi> by
him owned and protected, do conſent, be held out as the
confeſſion of that truth which he embraceth, it will be of
ſingular uſe unto, yea indeed muſt neceſſarily precede any
determination of the former queſtion: of the nature and
uſe of <hi>confeſſions,</hi> &amp;c. ſo much hath of late been <hi>learnedly</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted,
that I ſhall not powre out any of mine own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
for the preſent about them, in that haſty tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary
<hi>manner,</hi> wherein I am enforced to <hi>expoſe</hi> this eſſay.</p>
            <p>3. Thoſe who diſſent from the <hi>truth</hi> ſo <hi>owned,</hi> ſo <hi>eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
ſo decreed, do ſo, either in <hi>leſſe matters</hi> of ſmall conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,,
and about things, generally confeſſed <hi>not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,</hi>
or in great and more weighty heads of doctrine,
acts of worſhip, and the like: both agreeing in this, that
they will not hold <hi>communion</hi> as either to all, or ſome parts
and duties thereof, which thoſe <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>perſons</hi> who do
embrace the <hi>truth,</hi> ſo <hi>owned,</hi> as before, and act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, or ſuch as diſſent about things of
no great <hi>concernment</hi> in compariſon of thoſe other things
wherein they do agree, with them, from whom they do
diſſent, I am bold poſitively to aſſert, that, ſaving and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>qualifications</hi> ſet down under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
head, the Magiſtrate hath no <hi>warrant</hi> from the Word
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:165002:51"/>
of God, nor <hi>command, rule,</hi> or <hi>precept</hi> to enable him, to <hi>force</hi>
ſuch perſons to ſubmit unto the <hi>truth</hi> as by him eſtabliſhed,
in <hi>thoſe things,</hi> wherein they expreſſe a <hi>conſcientious</hi> diſſent,
or to moleſt them with any civill <hi>penalty</hi> in caſe of refuſall
or non-ſubmiſſion: nor yet did I ever in my life meet with
any thing in the <hi>ſhape</hi> of Reaſon to prove it, although the
great <hi>preſent clamor</hi> of this Nation, is <hi>punctually</hi> as to this
head: what ever be pretended, this is the <hi>Helena</hi> about
which is the great conteſt.</p>
            <p>What I pray will warrant him then to proceed?</p>
            <p>Will the Laws againſt Idolatry and Blaſphemy? with
their ſanctions towards the perſons of <hi>blaſphemers,</hi> and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters
(for I muſt ingenuouſly confeſſe, all that which in
my poore judgement looks with any appearance, of preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
toward <hi>Haereticidium,</hi> is the <hi>everlaſting</hi> equity of thoſe
judiciall Laws: and the <hi>Arbitrarineſſe</hi> of Magiſtrates, from
a divine <hi>rule</hi> in things of the greateſt concernment, to the
glory of God if free from them) and that theſe Laws I
doubt will ſcarcely be accommodated unto any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
conteſt now in this age of the world among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)
but ſhall I ſay, a <hi>warrant</hi> taken from hence for the
compelling of men, ſound in ſo many <hi>fundamentals,</hi> as were
it not for the <hi>conteſt</hi> with them, we would acknowledge
<hi>ſufficient</hi> for the entertainment of the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes,
to <hi>ſubject</hi> to, and cloſe with, the things contrary to
their preſent <hi>light</hi> and apprehenſion, (though under a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of being taught of God) or to inflict penalties upon a
refuſall ſo to do? <hi>Credat Apella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shall the <hi>examples</hi> of extraordinary judgements upon
<hi>Idolaters,</hi> falſe <hi>Prophets,</hi> by <hi>ſword</hi> and fire from heaven, (on
Magitians, Apoſtates, and the like) be here produced?
Though ſuch <hi>arguments</hi> as theſe have made thouſands
weep <hi>tears of blood,</hi> yet the conſequence in reaſon, cannot
but provoke <hi>laughter</hi> to all men not wholly forſaken of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting</hi>
principles.</p>
            <p>What then ſhall be done,<note place="margin">Qu:</note> they'l ſay? they have been <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed,
rebuked, convinced,</hi> muſt they now be <hi>let alone?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Something as to this I ſhal adde,<note place="margin">Anſ:</note> in the cloſe of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:165002:51"/>
for the preſent let learned <hi>Whitaker</hi> anſwer for me:
and <hi>firſt,</hi> to the firſt, of their being <hi>confuted. Poſſunt quidem
controverſiae ad externum forum deferri, &amp; ibi deſiniri: ſed conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia
in eo foro non acquieſcit, non enim poteſt conſcientia ſedari
ſine Spiritu ſancto.</hi> Let controverſies (ſaith he) be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
how you pleaſe, untill the conſcience be quieted by
the holy Spirit, there will be little peace. Unto which I
ſhall not adde any thing, conſidering what I ſaid before of
conviction: and to the latter of letting them alone, to their
own wayes. <hi>Eccleſiae quidem optatius eſt levibus quibuſdam diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſionibus
ad tempus agitari, quam in perfida pace acquieſcere;
non ergo ſufficit aliquo modo pacem conſervari niſi illam eſſe ſanctam

Better ſome trouble, then a perfidious, compell'd peace:
ſee him handle this more at large, with ſome excellent
concluſions to this purpoſe. <hi>Con: 4. de Rom. Pont. q. 1. cap. 1.

            <p>For theſe then, (and under this head I compare all ſuch
perſons as keeping in practiſe within the bonds before laid
forth, do ſo far forth hold the foundation, as that neither
by <hi>beleeving</hi> what <hi>is</hi> not, or diſ-beleeving what <hi>indeed</hi> is,
they do <hi>take</hi> in, or <hi>keep</hi> off, any ſuch thing as <hi>wherewithall</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>embraced,</hi> or without which, being <hi>rejected,</hi> the life of
Chriſt cannot in any <hi>caſe</hi> poſſibly conſiſt, nor ſalvation by
him be obtained) as the Magiſtrate is not bound by any
<hi>rule</hi> or <hi>precept</hi> to <hi>aſſiſt</hi> and maintain them, in the practiſe of
thoſe things, wherein they diſſent from the <hi>truth,</hi> ſo he is
bound, to <hi>protect them in peace</hi> and quietneſſe in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all <hi>civill rights and liberties;</hi> nor hath he either <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi>
or allowance, to <hi>proceed</hi> againſt them, as to the <hi>leaſt
penalty</hi> for their diſſent in thoſe things, they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
Attempts for <hi>uniformity</hi> among <hi>Saints,</hi> or <hi>ſuch</hi> as for
ought we can conclude, either from their <hi>opinions</hi> or <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
may be</hi> ſo, by externall force are purely Antichriſtian.</p>
            <p>Now for thoſe that ſtand at a <hi>greater diſtance</hi> from the
<hi>publickly</hi> owned and declared truths, ſuch as before we
ſpake of, the orderly way of dealing with <hi>ſuch,</hi> is in the <hi>firſt
place</hi> to bring them off from the <hi>error</hi> of the way, which
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:165002:52"/>
they have embraced: and untill <hi>that</hi> be done, all thoughts
of drawing in their <hi>aſſent</hi> to <hi>that,</hi> from which at ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
they ſtand, is vain and bootleſſe. Now what courſe
is to be taken for the effecting of this? <hi>ſpirituall wayes</hi> of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
are known to all, let them be uſed, and in caſe they
prove <hi>fruitleſſe,</hi> for ought that yet I can perceive, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of men ſo erring muſt be left in the ſtate and condition
we deſcribed under the <hi>ſecond head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now to drive on this <hi>buſineſſe</hi> any further by way of
<hi>conteſt</hi> I will not; my <hi>intention</hi> at the beginning, was onely
<hi>poſitively</hi> to aſſert, and to give in briefly the <hi>ſcripturall and
rationall</hi> bottoms, and proofs of thoſe aſſertions; wherein I
have gone aſide, to <hi>pull,</hi> or <hi>thruſt</hi> a line of debate, I have
tranſgreſſed againſt my own purpoſe; I hope it will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned:
though I am heartily deſirous any thing which
paſſeth my <hi>pen,</hi> may be brought to the teſt, and <hi>my ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced</hi>
where I have gone amiſſe, yet my ſpirit faints within
me, to think of <hi>that way</hi> of handling things in <hi>Controverſie,</hi>
which ſome men by <hi>reciprocation</hi> of anſwers, and replyes
have wound themſelves into <hi>Bolſecte,</hi> and <hi>Staphylus,</hi> and
<hi>Stapleton</hi> ſeem to live again, and much <hi>gall</hi> from beneath to
be powred into mens ink. Oh the deep wounds, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
hath received by the mutuall <hi>keen invectives</hi> of learned
men: I hope the Lord will preſerve me, from being enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with any man of ſuch a frame of ſpirit: what hath
been aſſerted may eaſily be caſt up in a few Poſitions, the
<hi>intelligent Reader</hi> will quickly diſcern what is aymed at,
and what I have ſtood to avow.</p>
            <p>If what is propoſed, be not ſatisfactory, I humbly offer
to the <hi>Honorable Parliament,</hi> that a <hi>certain number of learned
men,</hi> who are <hi>differently minded</hi> as to this buſineſſe of <hi>Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
which almoſt every where is ſpoken againſt, may be
deſired and <hi>required</hi> to a fair debate of the matter in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
before their own <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> that ſo, if it be poſſible,
ſome <hi>light</hi> may be given to the <hi>determination</hi> of this thing
of ſo great concernment, in the judgements of all men,
both on the one ſide and on the other, that ſo they may
<hi>try all things, and hold faſt that which is good.</hi>
