         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>THIS Book I look upon
as a Present so far from
worthy of your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that I cannot but charge my
self with Presumption in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Dedication of it. But as the
Work it self was written under
your Roof, and the Author of it
<pb facs="tcp:51472:3"/>
had the honour at the same time
to be generously obliged by your
Highness. As it is properly the
Life of an Hero, whom you your
self have encountred with his Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitar
in his hand; an Hero whose
Victorious Course was then stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
by your assistance, when our
brave <hi>French</hi> gave that famous
Defeat to the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> near
the River <hi>Raab;</hi> the place where
you gave so many signal marks of
that extraordinary Valour, which
is essential to the Character of
your Illustrious Family, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
to all that bear your
Name; to whom, Sir, should I
inscribe this Book but to your
self, either upon the point of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
or protection? To sum up the
number of your Ancestors, whose
great Actions fill the best pages
<pb facs="tcp:51472:3"/>
of our History; to present you
with your Pedigree, or the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits
of so many Princes who have
made your very Name immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;
to insist upon those that bear
it now, and by their own merit,
and the great Charges they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess,
are so considerable; that
in your Highness and your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
one may behold all that is
high, and exalted in <hi>France;</hi> to
say that in your Family those
Dignities are at present united,
which never met in any Kings
Reign before, as the Office of
<hi>Great Chamberlain, Great Almoner of
France,</hi> and <hi>Colonel of the Light
Horse.</hi> I am not, Sir, now to
learn, that these are Truths
would offend your Modesty, and
that it is peculiar to your House
to reject all praises, how just so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
<pb facs="tcp:51472:4"/>
This is the reason that
makes me sparing upon this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject;
and to content my self
with this humble profession, that
I am with all respect, and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as I ought to be,</p>

                  <p>THere needs no more to declare
to all the World who you are,
when I shall tell them, that it is to the
most Religious, and vertuous; the
most discreet, and the most charming
of your Sex: to speak less, were to
injure your Merits, as well as my
Iudgment; to say more (and name
you) were to undervalue the discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all who know what perfection
is, and where all the Graces which
are scattered amongst other Ladies of
Quality are assembled in one.</p>
                  <p>I made choice of this piece (whilst I
was lately at <hi>Paris</hi>) to divert my Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness
with; because the Truth and
Dignity of the Historical Part (which
you more affect) may commute for the
Trifles of the Romantick (which you less
<pb facs="tcp:51472:5"/>
regard) and have rendered it
English, not because you are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Original (who are
Mistress of the most polished Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges)
but to give you some account of
the instructions I acknowledge to have
received from you, how I should em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the less serious moments of my
Time, as well as the most studious,
and recollected. I had but to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
your example, to pay at once my
duty to God, my self, and all the
world.</p>
                  <p>This is the express Character of
my Governess, the account her Pupil
thinks fit to give of his attempt, and

                        <hi>AMurath</hi> the Fourth of that
name, Emperor of the <hi>Turks,</hi>
had no sooner put an end to
the differences that were
between him, and <hi>Vladislaus</hi> the great
King of <hi>Poland,</hi> but he immediately
resolved to execute his long intended
design of recovering the City of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
vulgarly called <hi>Bagdet. Pekier
Bassa,</hi> the better to shelter himself
from <hi>Amurath,</hi> had delivered it to
the King of <hi>Persia.</hi> The importance
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51472:6"/>
of this enterprise was such, as made
the <hi>Sultan</hi> think his own presence
necessary to accomplish it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to reestablish that glory which
his Arms had lost under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of his Generals, he took the
field at the head of three hundred
thousand men, with such expedition,
that he prevented the <hi>Sophy,</hi> and
forced him to retire after he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
some places, which were not
before in a condition to make any
resistance. <hi>Tauris</hi> was the first place
that presumed to withstand the <hi>Sultan;</hi>
and it was so vigorously defended,
that it provok'd him after he had
taken it, to rase it, and plough up its
very Foundations, thereby to strike
terror into other places which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to attack; from thence he
march'd to <hi>Revan,</hi> where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
brought him the Keys, and
came over to his side. Being thus
possessed of this place, he turned all
his Forces against <hi>Babylon,</hi> which he
besieged and plied so furiously that
at two and fifty days end, he carried
it, after four of the bloudiest Assaults
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51472:6"/>
that were ever made. The Pillage of
it he bestowed on his Souldiers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
them to put all to the Sword
without regard of Age, or Sex. Not
satisfied with this advantage, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
his Conquests over divers
Provinces, wasting all the Country
through which he past, and nothing
being able to satiate his desire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
but the defeat of the <hi>Sophy,</hi>
he staid not to attend his coming, but
advanc'd to find him out, and offer
him Battle; which the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarch
thought not fit to hazard against the
Victorious <hi>Ottoman,</hi> but retreated to
the remotest Mountains of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:
from whence, the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi>
seeing he could not draw him by open
force, he resolved to send him a
challenge, by which he let him know,
that setting apart the consideration
of those great advantages he might
certainly promise himself from so
powerful an Army, (which was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to subdue all <hi>Persia,</hi>) he was
ready by a private Combate to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
their antient quarrel, and the
War which had so long ingaged both
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51472:7"/>
Nations. The <hi>Sophy</hi> to free himself
from the Obligation of answering it,
made as if he had not received this
challenge; and dispatched a Cham or
<hi>Persian</hi> Prince, to make overtures of
Peace to <hi>Amurath:</hi> Who perceiving his
Troops to be much harrassed, to give
them some repose, consented to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the course of his Victories, and
hearkned to the Propositions of the
<hi>Sophy,</hi> leaving his <hi>Grand Visier</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him to conclude the Peace,
whilest he himself retired to <hi>Damas:</hi>
where, till the season was fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into <hi>Europe,</hi> he refreshed himself
after the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of a charming <hi>Persian</hi> Lady, who far
out-shined all his other Favorites.</p>
                     <p>This beautiful <hi>Persian,</hi> was Sister to
<hi>Emir Gumer,</hi> who to obtain the <hi>Grand
Signiors</hi> Favor, when he basely sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered
<hi>Revan</hi> to him, presented
him also with his Sister <hi>Rachima.</hi> The
effect which her Charms had on the
<hi>Sultans</hi> Heart, made the <hi>Sultaness
Roxana,</hi> who had followed him to
the <hi>Persian</hi> War, extremely Jealous.
This Princess was not wont to suffer
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51472:7"/>
a Rival; her Reign had been long
and uncontrolled, and she had often
sent the finest Women in the <hi>Seraglio</hi>
into the other World, so soon as she
was informed that they indeavoured
to seduce her Gallant. <hi>Amurath</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acquainted with, and fearing her
humor, to prevent her resentment,
and free himself from her importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Jealousie, sent her away before
him to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> where all the
extraordinary Honors that were paid
her, were not sufficient to ballance
her vexation for being supplanted by
another; but not being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
her self on her Rival, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to fall upon those who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
at her disgrace. Her Jealousie,
and cruelty made her formidable to
all the World; but none had more
reason to mistrust her than the <hi>Grand
Signiors</hi> Brothers <hi>Bajazet, Orcan,</hi> and
<hi>Ibrahim,</hi> the two first, (whose Valor
equall'd their Birth) were tired with
her persecutions: they knew her to be
the cause that their Brother kept them
in Prison, and how she had done her
utmost to destroy them, that none
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51472:8"/>
might remain to dispute the Empire
with her own Son. The fear of death
which threatned them, had hitherto
kept them from shewing themselves
justly sensible of the wrongs which
the <hi>Sultana Valide</hi> their Mother, and
the Princesses their Sisters had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
at her hands; but having learnt
that she had lost much of <hi>Amuraths</hi>
esteem, they laid aside their former
moderation, and began openly to
complain of <hi>Roxana;</hi> who was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
at it, that she vow'd their ruin, to
let her Enemies see that her Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was not at all diminished, and that
none should go unpunished who offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her, nothing was left undone that
might conduce to the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of her design. By fair promises
she gained the <hi>Caimacan</hi> or Lieutenant
to the <hi>Grand Visier,</hi> (to whom the
Sultan had left the charge of his two
Brothers,) to act without acquainting
<hi>Amurath,</hi> left that should discover
her Treason. She counterfeited Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which assured him that these
Princes had intelligence with their
Brothers Enemies, and after she had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51472:8"/>
prepared all things necessary to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
what she was about to do, she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
a false Order of the <hi>Sultans,</hi>
and was so cruel as to go herself (at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by the Executioners,) to tell
the unfortunate Princes that she sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
them to her own hatred ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to the interest of <hi>Amurath.
Bajazet</hi> after he had reproached her
with all her crimes, and given her
thanks for taking away that life
which he could not imploy in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
her, submitted to the Mutes
who came to strangle him. <hi>Orcan</hi> was
not so patient; for without upbraiding
her, he stood upon his Guard, and
having slain two, disabled two more
from having any hand in his death,
which he was forced to undergo at
last as well as his Brother.</p>
                     <p>The Murder of these two Princes
caused an universal sorrow, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation;
their Courage had given
the World great hopes, and their
death so inflamed the People against
the <hi>Sultana,</hi> that had not the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> arrived, they had torn her
out of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and made her a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51472:9"/>
victim to the Public hate. <hi>Amurath</hi>
was received in Triumph, with more
magnificence than was ever afforded
any of his Predecessors, after their
most Signal Victories. He had left
<hi>Rachima</hi> at <hi>Damas,</hi> which made <hi>Roxana</hi>
believe that she was not quite blotted
out of his Heart, and that she should
soon recover her ground. To this end
she made it her whole business to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
more charming in his Eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
she brought him to thank her for
the death of his Brothers, as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
service, by which she had
diverted the dangers that threatened
his Person, and Empire. She had
indeed a greater Ascendent over
<hi>Amurath</hi> than she could hope for,
and found it no difficult matter, to
rekindle in him all those flames,
which the fair <hi>Rachima</hi> seemed to
have extinguished. He now heaped
new favours on her, and abandoned
himself to such excess of Love, as
proved fatal to one of the Princesses,
his Sister. As she came one day to
cast herself at his Feet to complain
of <hi>Roxanas</hi> injurious carriage towards
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51472:9"/>
her, and of the unjust death of her
two Brothers, he was so inraged at
her, that with a Battle-ax which he
held in his hand, he gave her a blow
on the head, of which the Young
Princess died on the place. <hi>Roxanas</hi>
hatred was not satisfied with this
Murther, she would have added that
of the <hi>Grand Visiers Achomat,</hi> because
he was of the <hi>Sultana Valides</hi> party, of
whose Authority she was Jealous. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the intention she had of putting
the <hi>Caimacan</hi> who was wholy her crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
into his place, she found means
to render him criminal, by accusing
him of being acquainted with, and
favouring the designs of the Princes.
This was enough to ruin him, but the
fall of this great Favourites head,
made such a noise, that it awakened
all the Grandees of the Empire; they
complained loudly of the injustices
which the <hi>Great Sultana</hi> made the
Emperor every day commit; they
ript up all the Murders she had been
guilty of, and caused the Mufty in
behalf of the Public, to complain of
her to <hi>Amurath.</hi> He had no sooner
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51472:10"/>
begun to acquit himself of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Commission, but the <hi>Sultana
Kiozem Amuraths</hi> Mother came and
presented her self to him, together
with a Slave whom she brought to
discover the Plot, that <hi>Roxana</hi> had
formed against her Life. The <hi>Sultan</hi>
at first would believe nothing, but the
Eunuch whose remorse had made
him acquaint the <hi>Sultana Valide</hi> with
what was contrived against her, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
so earnestly that after he
had discharged his Conscience of
those secrets which filled him with
horror, he was not afraid to die,
that at last <hi>Amurath</hi> was convinced.
<hi>Roxana</hi> was sent for to answer to the
crimes that were laid to her charge,
which she did with so much Pride
and Disdain, that not being able
longer to defer her punishment, by
burying his Poynard in her heart, he
endeavoured with his own hand to
repair all those ills she had been the
cause of. She was three and twenty
years old, and was thought the
handsomest woman that ever came
into the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> Her Picture that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51472:10"/>
                        <hi>Amurath</hi> ordered to be Drawn in the
first transports of his Passion, which
he always kept in his Closet, shews
her to have been an accomplished
Beauty. She was tall and well
shaped, her <hi>Min</hi> was noble, and
her Gate becoming, her Hair of a
fair light Brown, the turn of her
Face was Oval, her Complexion
was very Clear and Smooth, her
Eyes full and sparkling, her Nose
well made, her Mouth little, her
Lips Vermillion, her Teeth good and
well set, her Chin was proportion'd
to the rest of her Face, her Neck
perfectly well shaped, with very pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Hands, her Physiognomy was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising:
There was such an air of
Majesty throughout her whole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as drew the admiration of all
the World; but with this she had
Vices that rendered her insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
she was so cruel as to sacrifice
all things to her Ambition and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie;
she delighted in Treachery
and Revenge, and certainly she was
the most Proud and Inhuman Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
that ever liv'd.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:51472:11"/>
                        <hi>Amurath,</hi> having by the death of
this Favourite appeased the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs
of his People, resolved to keep
himself from being so strongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
for the future; but all his
Passions were violent; he now want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
imployment, had no Wars to busie
himself in, and the remembrance of
his past cruelties stung him continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.
Every one endeavoured to drive
away his deep melancholly, which
was looked upon as dangerous, by
entertaining him with pleasures and
diversions. The Empire never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
a greater Calm, and nothing
was thought of in <hi>Constantinople</hi> but
feasting and rejoycing. The <hi>Grand
Signiors</hi> Court since the Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with the <hi>Persian,</hi> was crowded
with idle Officers, who waited there
in expectation of some recompence
for their Services.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mahomet Coprogli Pacha</hi> was one of
this number,<note place="margin">The Original of <hi>Mahomet Coprogli.</hi>
                        </note> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was named <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>progly,</hi> whom some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
to be the Son of a Mariner, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of a Gentleman, who by some
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51472:11"/>
concerns of his Family, being obliged
to quit <hi>France,</hi> and settle himself in
<hi>Italy,</hi> was in his Voyage thither
assaulted, and slain by a <hi>Turkish</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
by whom his Son then about
ten or twelve years old, was made a
Slave, and carried into <hi>Cyprus.</hi> The
<hi>Bassa Barac Bey,</hi> Governour of this
Island, taking notice of the gallant
Spirit of young <hi>Coprogli</hi> and his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to Arms, Educated him with
great care, and when he went to
the <hi>Persian</hi> War took him along with
him, where he behaved himself so
well, that he obtained a <hi>Timariots</hi>
Place for him of the Emperor <hi>Achmet,</hi>
and another very considerable charge
in the Army, in which afterwards his
Son <hi>Mahomet Coprogli,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his youth and the contrary cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of the <hi>Turks,</hi> succeeded him: He
acquitted himself in his imployment
with great reputation, and by his
merit and good <hi>Min,</hi> advantageously
maintained that Credit which his
Valor had gained in the War.
Though he had been all his Life
time in the Camp, yet he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51472:12"/>
none of that Rudeness and
Barbarity which is commonly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
in the Carriage and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of Souldiers; but was as refined,
as if he had never been absent from
the Court, whose Maxims he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
acquainted with, and was a
better Politician than those that sate
at the Helm. This made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think
himself of getting some power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Patron who might advance him
in the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Favor, not
being ignorant, that the most deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Courtiers make no Progress
without such a Protector at their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Elbow. His insinuation and good
humor soon gained him the esteem,
and friendship of the great men;
more particularly of the <hi>Kisler Agasi</hi>
named <hi>Vglan</hi> Chief of the Eunuchs
in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and Prime Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
and Confident of the <hi>Grand
Signiors</hi> secret Pleasures. This Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch
was so favorable to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet
Coprogli,</hi> that he promised to
second him in all occasions that might
serve to raise his Fortune. He was
a man of great address, had long
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51472:12"/>
experience in all the Intrigues of
the Court in which he was grown
old, and had obtained this honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Station by extraordinary Merit.
From him <hi>Mahomet Coprogli</hi> received
Precepts how to behave himself,
which were very serviceable in the
raifing him to that preferment which
he soon after arrived to. He disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to him the most secret privacies
of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> and the Court; instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
him in the humor and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Emperor, and told him
the best means to obtain his good
Graces, concealing nothing which
might perfectly instruct him in all
the interests of the Great Families
of the Empire, and the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors</hi>
Favorites. <hi>Coprogli</hi> knew well
enough how to make his advantage of
the informations of this crafty <hi>Aga.</hi>
He began to put them in practice
by compliance and submission to the
<hi>Bassas,</hi> and all those who were near
the <hi>Sultan.</hi> He was ever of the
number of those with whom the
Emperor diverted himself; the desire
he had to please him made him use
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51472:13"/>
a thousand little arts, and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
so successful, that <hi>Amurath</hi> began
to distinguish him from the crowd,
and to look kindly upon him; which
soon made the Courtiers jealous of
him. Envy is a Vice inseparable
from the Favor of Princes, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
those hated whom they honor
with their Friendship. <hi>Coprogli</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
found the truth of this: Those
whose esteem he had purchased by
his Civility, and obliging conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
before he was known to the
<hi>Sultan,</hi> no sooner perceived the good
reception he met with, but they
openly declared themselves his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and endeavoured all they could
to overthrow the Foundation of his
growing Fortune: but he having
foreseen this alteration, had armed
himself with Constancy against their
persecutions. He behaved himself
so wisely, that Envy herself had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to charge him withal, yet
though he was prudent enough to
avoid all the traps the Courtiers
laid for him, he could not preserve
himself from falling into the very
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51472:13"/>
first snares of Love. One day <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi>
having (as he was often wont to
do) made a debauch with his principal
Favourites, he took a fancy to walk
in the Gardens of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and as
an extraordinary favour to let them
go in along with him. When the
<hi>Sultan</hi> walks in these Gardens, it is
ordinarily with a design to favour
some <hi>Sultana;</hi> and when he passes by
the Ladies apartment, they use to
throw Flowers to him, and send him
Fruits, and Works of their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
to deserve his kindness. They
send these Presents commonly by
young Slaves, or Odalisques, who
forget not to inform him of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses
Name and Beauty. <hi>Amurath</hi>
chose to walk in a Terrass, which ran
along by the <hi>Seraglio</hi> of the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s,
and ended in a Cabinet that looked
on the Sea. This place he had built
at his return from the Persian War, to
riot in with the more freedom. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he often came with his Migni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that Persian Lord <hi>Gumer,</hi>
who to avoid the punishment due to
his Treason, had followed him to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51472:14"/>
                        <hi>Constantinople.</hi> This man was one of
the most exquisite debauchées of his
time; he had found the way to gain
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s affection, by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him to drink Wine, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
other excesses not fit to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
He entertained and discoursed
with the <hi>Sultan,</hi> while he passed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Balconies, where he saw se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Sultana</hi>'s. It may be the good
humour he was then in made him go
by them, to shew them to his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites;
or perhaps, not having had any
commerce with the Ladies since the
death of <hi>Roxana,</hi> he began to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of living so reserved from the fair
Sex, and had a mind to let the <hi>Sultanas</hi>
know, that he had not resolved to
deprive himself for ever of those
sweets which he might taste in their
company. Whatever it was, he was
not displeased to see himself accosted
by a young slave, who presented him
with a basket of Fruit from a fair
one he had not yet seen. This mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
did no less surprise him than the
Fruits, which were some of them na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
others artificial; so well coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51472:14"/>
that they were hard to be
distinguished. While <hi>Amurath</hi> was
busied in choosing the Fruit, <hi>Mahomet
Coprogli</hi> who stood behind him, was
considering the beauty of the slave
who brought it: he was naturally
more gallant than ordinarily those of
his Nation are, and seeing the <hi>Sultan</hi>
taken up with the admiration of the
Fruits, and the Courtiers earnestly
commending the Lady who sent
them, he thought he had a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to let the young slave know
what he thought of her beauty. But
he not being the only man in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
who had discerning eyes, the
charms of <hi>Fatima</hi> (so was the young
Odalisque called) had made an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
on more hearts than his.
He had hardly time to speak some
few words to her, but, he was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by <hi>Zelim Achmet,</hi> one of the
<hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Favourites. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
fierce man addressed himself
to <hi>Fatima</hi> more calmly then was
otherwise natural to him, and seeing
her eyes fixed on <hi>Coprogli,</hi> whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
without doubt she was not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51472:15"/>
displeased to hear, he could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
himself from shewing his distaste,
and looking scornfully on a man
whom he already apprehended as his
Rival. The presence of the <hi>Grand
Signior,</hi> and the consideration of the
place where he was, kept <hi>Mahomet
Coprogli</hi> from answering the fierceness
of <hi>Zelim Achmet</hi> with actions, and
looks as disdainful as his own. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
at present mastered his resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which would have broke out
in another place, notwithstanding the
splendid fortune of this Favourite.
However to revenge himself in some
sort he kept as near <hi>Fatime</hi> as he could,
to hinder <hi>Zelim</hi> from having an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of declaring his passion to
her. The difficulty of seeing women
in <hi>Turky,</hi> and above all, those who
are shut up in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> causes Love
not to be so tedious there as in other
places where one must sigh a long
time before one can make a formal
discovery of it. Therefore <hi>Zelim Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
for fear of wanting another op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
thought it not fit any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to delay speaking to <hi>Fatima:</hi> 
                        <q>Fair
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51472:15"/>
                           <hi>Odalisque,</hi> said he to her, if your
heart be as cruel as your face is
charming, the sight of you would
make me despair, not being able to
look on you without loving you, or
love you without a desire to please
you.</q> 
                        <hi>Mahomet Coprogli</hi> could not
hear this declaration without regret.
He cast his eyes languishingly on <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima,</hi>
who at the same time turning
hers towards him, could not help let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him perceive that his comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had touched her more sensibly
than that of <hi>Zelim;</hi> and she had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
opened her mouth, to give him
doubtless a favourable answer, when
the Emperour, who heard them speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
behind him, turned about to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
in the conversation; the subject
of which he soon found out by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the young Odalisque, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
her face more attentively
than he had done before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amurath,</hi> who setting a side his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
and avarice, had all the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
qualities that can be desired in a
Prince, was also infinitely gallant;
he continued the good humour he was
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51472:16"/>
in, that he might not interrupt the
conversation of <hi>Zelim</hi> and <hi>Coprogli</hi>
with <hi>Fatima.</hi> 
                        <q>For all that I see,
(said he to the two Courtiers) your
judgment is very good, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
blame you for being so earnest
to gain the friendship of this lovely
Odalisque. I my self, continued he
laughing, am beholding to your
gallantry for having made me take
notice of her merit; but were you
not disputing with her to know
whether her Mistresses beauty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals
hers? I'le clear that doubt to
day, added he, addressing himself
to <hi>Fatima,</hi> and I will see if the fair
unknown who sent you hither, has
charms enough of her own, not to
mistrust yours.</q> The young Slave
answered what he said with so much
wit, that he was wholly ravished:
but the joy that he shewed, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
disturbed <hi>Zelim,</hi> and <hi>Coprogli,</hi>
who began to be Rivals, and already
looked on one another as such. They
fear'd lest the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> should rob
them of <hi>Fatima,</hi> otherwise they might
reasonably enough pretend to her, as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51472:16"/>
being one of those slaves that wait
on the <hi>Sultanas,</hi> and that are ordinarily
matched to the great ones of the Port,
who marry them that they may gain
the favour of the <hi>Sultanas. Mahomet
Coprogli</hi> was deserving enough to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Fatima,</hi> but the power of <hi>Zelim
Achmet</hi> made him despair; he knew
his love, and fear'd, not without good
reason, lest he should make use of
his credit with the <hi>Sultan,</hi> to deprive
him of his Mistress: so that jealousie
and fear seized on his soul almost as
soon as love, The confusion he was in
made him resolve to discover his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the great Eunuch, and implore
his assistance, who promised him to
have a care of his interests as well
with his Master, as his Mistress, and
was as good as his word.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sultana Valide, Amurath</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the <hi>Kislar Agasi</hi> who were
the two powerfullest persons in the
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> were very good friends
ever since the death of cruel <hi>Roxana.</hi>
They had plotted between them to
furnish the <hi>Sultan</hi> with a new Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
who being beholden to them for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51472:17"/>
her greatness, should be obliged to
espouse all their interests. The Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch
<hi>Vglan</hi> had undertaken to choose
a fair one that should be proper for
their design; he had cast his eyes on
<hi>Zaime,</hi> a young woman that came to
the <hi>Seraglio</hi> in the absence of <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath,</hi>
she was recommended to him by
the <hi>Bassa</hi> of the Sea, who had taken
her away upon the Coasts of <hi>Circassia.</hi>
Her beauty and her wit render'd her
worthy of the place she was destin'd
to; and Nature had made her so sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising
that she needed no body to
speak in her behalf. The <hi>Sultana
Valide,</hi> and the <hi>Kislar Agasi</hi> made no
question but that she would infinitely
please <hi>Amurath;</hi> to which end they
agreed together what means they
should use to captivate the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors</hi>
mind, who seemed to have no
more inclination to love. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<hi>Zaime</hi> that they intended to
make her great <hi>Sultana,</hi> and to ingage
her the more to be greateful, exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
the beauty and merit of many
others, before whom they preferred
her. Then they instructed her what
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51472:17"/>
she should do to get the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s good
opinion, and perswaded her to send
him some of her own Works, which
were done with a great deal of Art,
to make him desire to know her. <hi>Zaime</hi>
waited for an opportunity to execute
what they had contrived, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that the Emperor was in the
Gardens of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> She chose the
time when he was walking on the
Terrace we spoke of, to send him her
Present, which she had disposed in
little baskets of her own working.
She gave this imployment to <hi>Fatima,</hi>
whom she chiefly esteemed; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thought that <hi>Amurath</hi> would have
found her so handsome as to fall in
love with her: if she had made this
reflection, she would not have hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a conquest, the whole glory of
which she intended to reserve to her
self. Truly <hi>Zaime</hi> had need of all her
charms to efface the impression which
<hi>Fatima</hi> had made in the <hi>Sultans</hi> heart,
whom she wholly possest so at first
sight, that she had no leisure so much
as to think of the Odalisque; and in
a short time she rendred her self more
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51472:18"/>
absolute over his will, than ever the
crafty <hi>Roxana</hi> had been; but she made
better use of her power, and forgot
not that she owed it all to the great
Eunuch, being impatient till she had
testified her acknowledgments to him,
when he came to recommend the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
of <hi>Mahomet Coprogli</hi> to her, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her to beg the Government of
<hi>Baruth</hi> for him of the Emperour.</p>
                     <p>This Government is very consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
it was sought for by many Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
and Officers; but <hi>Zaime</hi> who had
a mind to oblige <hi>Vglan,</hi> spoke so sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
to <hi>Amurath,</hi> that she obtained
it for <hi>Coprogli</hi> before all other Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors,
even <hi>Zelim Achmet</hi> himself,
to whom the <hi>Sultan</hi> had promised it.
She immediately got his Commission
drawn, which she put into the great
Eunuchs hands, withal assuring him
that this was the least Grace he could
ask of her; that she would make no
other advantage of her power but to
serve him; and that since he was
kind to <hi>Coprogli</hi> she would take care of
his Fortune. The Eunuch who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
these marks of her goodness,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51472:18"/>
with a great many submissions, and
thanks, would no longer defer the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of <hi>Coprogli</hi>'s happiness.
He told the Princess <hi>Zaime</hi> that he
was infinitely sensible of what she had
done for him, but that since by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of generosity, she was pleased
not only to load him with her bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
but to extend them also to his
friends; he beseeched her to pity the
love of <hi>Coprogli,</hi> who as soon as he first
saw <hi>Fatima,</hi> became desperately in
love with her. This slave was very
dear to <hi>Zaime,</hi> and the proposition of
the <hi>Kislar Agazi</hi> surprised her at first:
she could not bestow <hi>Fatima</hi> on his
friend without parting with her for
ever. This separation seemed very
difficult to her, and she could have
wished that <hi>Vglan</hi> to whom she could
refuse nothing, had desired any thing
else of her; but the great Eunuch
who had undertaken to render <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
Caprogli</hi> happy, resolved to finish
what he had begun, and at last pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
so far upon her, that she had
no power to deny his request. <q>Go
<hi>Vglan</hi> said she to the Eunuch, go tell
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51472:19"/>
your friend, that he is beholden to
you for a favour, which none but
you could have obtained of me.</q> The
<hi>Kislar Agazi</hi> did what became him on
this occasion, and reiterated all the
protestations he had before made of
being faithful to her as long as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
His place puts him in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of obliging or disobliging the
<hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Mistresses, which makes
them have the more respect for the
chief of the Eunuchs who govern
their <hi>Seraglio.</hi> He was no sooner as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of <hi>Coprogli</hi>'s felicity, but he sent
for him to tell him the good news,
who notwithstanding what he knew
of the Eunuchs power, could hardly
be perswaded that in so short a time
he had been so successful, as to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
both his ambition and his love.
But at last being possest of <hi>Fatima,</hi> and
<hi>Vglan</hi> having given him his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
for his Government, he thought of
nothing beside the enjoyment of his
good Fortune, which by the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Sultana,</hi> and the friendship
of the <hi>Kislar Agazi</hi> seemed to be firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
established. But when he was ready
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51472:19"/>
to go and take possession of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
he saw himself exposed to
the cruel persecutions of <hi>Zelim Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</hi>
This formidable Rival was not
able to see his Mistress, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of <hi>Baruth</hi> to fall to <hi>Copro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli</hi>'s
share, without being jealous even
to fury.</p>
                     <p>He could not indure a preference
that made him almost desperate, he
presumed much on his own merit, on
the <hi>Sultans</hi> favour to him, and on the
authority of his Uncle <hi>Ragep Bassa,</hi>
who had succeeded in the charge of
<hi>Grand Visier,</hi> after the death of <hi>Acho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat;</hi>
so that <hi>Coprogli</hi> was to expect all
the ill offices that a private man can
receive from a great Minister, and a
Favourite who has his Princes ear:
but yet having the <hi>Sultana</hi> on his side,
he believed her able to protect him
against his enemies: And he was so
confident of this, that without taking
any other measures, he parted from
<hi>Constantinople</hi> with the fair <hi>Fatima,</hi> to
go and take possession of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Baruth.</hi> He exercised his
charge with so much integrity, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51472:20"/>
he deserved the adoration of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
But who can be innocent when
merit it self is an offence? The <hi>Grand
Visier Ragep</hi> was wholly swayed by his
Nephew <hi>Achmet,</hi> who could not digest
the affront which he pretended he had
received from <hi>Mahomet Coprogli,</hi> and
was not satisfied with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Syria,</hi> which the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
had given him to comfort him for
missing that of <hi>Baruth.</hi> This insolent
Favourite projected the ruine of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>progli;</hi>
but seeing that the <hi>Sultana Zaime</hi>
protected him, policy kept him from
declaring himself openly against him,
for fear of displeasing the Emperour
who adored <hi>Zaime.</hi> He knew <hi>Amuraths</hi>
humour perfectly well, and saw plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that to oppose his love, was the
way to ruine himself; therefore not
to hazard any thing, he contain'd
himself in expectation of some more
favourable opportunity of revenge:
and time had afforded him means, if
the authority of the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> his
Uncle had continued. Heaven which
is weary of the injustice of the wicked,
could no longer bear with those of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51472:20"/>
                        <hi>Ragep Bassa,</hi> but destroyed him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the innocent, who were the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of his cruelties and treacheries.
The jealousie which this <hi>Ragep,</hi> when
he was but a simple <hi>Bassa,</hi> had hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had of <hi>Emir Ticcardin</hi> Prince of
<hi>Drus,</hi> whom the chance of War had
made a Prisoner at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> after
the loss of his Children, his Estate,
and Treasures, made him now afresh
persecute him with calumnies, and
engage the <hi>Mufti</hi> and Religion against
him, that he might oblige the <hi>Sultan</hi>
to behead the <hi>Emir,</hi> who derived
himself from <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> King
of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and was the Protector
of the Christians, and Franks in the
Eastern Provinces. He had counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Amurath</hi> to put to death <hi>Camtemir</hi>
King of the petty Tartars, whom he
had brought to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> under
pretence of making his peace with
the Great <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary,</hi> who had
corrupted him with Bribes. At last he
had conspired to depose the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi>
and set up his Brother <hi>Ibrahim</hi> in
his place, So that the <hi>Sultan</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the treasons of this first
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51472:21"/>
Minister, who was the Author of all
the Confusions in the State: he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him to be strangled, and by his
death prevented the destruction of
many of the Grandees of the Port,
whom he would have sacrificed to his
ambition. This disgrace forced <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim
Achmet</hi> to let <hi>Coprogli</hi> be quiet for
some time.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Amurath,</hi> who had
ended the Persian War, and calmed
the troubles of his Empire, abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself to the delights of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio.</hi>
But Death which had spared
him in Armies where he was exposed
to the greatest dangers, surprized him
in the midst of his pleasures; for in the
<hi>Beyran,</hi> which is the Turks Easter, at
which time they are wont to be very
merry, the better to forget the auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of their <hi>Ramazan,</hi> or Lent. The <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
made a debauch with the <hi>Selich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, Cham Gumar, Machut,</hi> and <hi>Iarzai,</hi>
two other Persians, in which he drank
so excessively of <hi>Malvasie,</hi> and <hi>Ros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solis,</hi>
that he inflamed his bowels, and
fell into a burning Feaver, of which
he died a few days after. Several
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51472:21"/>
Diseases, had taken away all his
Children, and his cruelty had put all
his Brothers to death, except <hi>Ibrahim,</hi>
whom he thought incapable of reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
While he was sick, he asked of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to see him, intending as some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
to have had him strangled, that
he might leave none of his Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him, but what should be born of
<hi>Zaime,</hi> whom he knew to be with
child. He had named <hi>Rahim Chiras,
Cham</hi> of the petty Tartars to be his
Successor, and had made a secret a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
with him, that in case <hi>Zaime</hi>
should be brought to bed of a Son, he
should resign the Empire to him. But
the <hi>Divan</hi> ordained otherwise, and the
<hi>Sultana Valide</hi> had no sooner closed his
eyes but she went to take <hi>Ibrahim</hi> out
of Prison. This Prince made some
difficulty at the proposition which
the <hi>Sultana</hi> his Mother, the <hi>Mufti,</hi> the
<hi>Visiers</hi> and <hi>Bassa's</hi> made him of ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Throne; believing it to be a
design to surprize him, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to counterfeit himself mad, as he
had done till then, by the advice of
the Eunuch <hi>Zomboul</hi> his Governour,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51472:22"/>
who had taught him this way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the cruelty of his Brother <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath;</hi>
but when he saw the Emperors
dead body, he convinced them that
he had concealed his Reason to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his life; and shewed so much
judgment, that he at first suprized
those who knew the manner of his
Education.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ibrahim</hi> having taken up the reins
of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, began his
Reign with such Justice and Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as seemed to give the people an
undoubted assurance of an happy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
The first Commandment
he gave was to <hi>Mustapha</hi> his <hi>Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier,</hi>
who had succeeded <hi>Ragep,</hi> That
he should put no man to death, unless
he were convict of so enormous a
Crime, that he could not be pardoned
without committing a greater. This
Prince was extremely good natur'd,
as might be seen by the lineaments of
his face: he had a ruddy Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a broad Forehead, his Limbs well
set, but his Behaviour was very silly,
and innocent, proceeding from his
obscure Education, which had quite
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51472:22"/>
changed the vigor of his mind and
health, so that it was feared he could
have no children. This made the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi>
his Mother have a great care of
the <hi>Sultana Zaime,</hi> whom she knew to
be with child. <hi>Zaime</hi> who loved the
<hi>Sultana Valide</hi> as her own Mother, had
discovered it to her; and the subtil
<hi>Sultana Kiozem Ibrahim</hi>'s Mother not
believing he would leave a Son be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him, would not suffer <hi>Zaime</hi> to
retire into the old <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where the
<hi>Sultanas</hi> of the deceased <hi>Grand Signiors</hi>
shut themselves up. She fancied it
would be no hard matter to perswade
<hi>Ibrahim</hi> to love her: <hi>Zaime</hi> was young,
her great belly appeared not, and no
body knew of it; nor was it difficult
to make him believe that the Child
she should be brought to bed of was
his own: but there was no need of
all this contrivance, for <hi>Ibrahim</hi> who
never knew what love was, was so
well satisfied with <hi>Zaime,</hi> that exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
no farther, he abandon'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
wholly to the enjoyment of her:
yet afterwards not contented with
the delights he found in this Princess,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51472:23"/>
who had taught him to love; he had
a mind to try if another could not as
well recommend those pleasures
which had so long been unknown to
him, and took a liking to an handsome
<hi>Georgian,</hi> well born, and a Christian,
who had been taken from her Parents
at twelve years old, and brought to
the great <hi>Seraglio</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> as
a perfect beauty. She had been bred
very carefully, having been taught to
sing, and play on several Instruments,
to accompany her voice, which was
admirable: and it was by this that
she had attracted <hi>Ibrahim.</hi> This Prince
was a great lover of Musick, both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental,
and vocal. He walked
one evening under a Balcony, where
the young <hi>Bassée,</hi> so was the fair <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian</hi>
called, sung a Song so passionate,
that he would needs know the person
that had sung it: but having found
by conversing with her, that she had
no less Wit than Beauty, he was so
charmed, that immediately he threw
her his Handkerchief, as a sure pledge
of his Love, and a certain token that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51472:23"/>
she should that very night receive
more particular favours.</p>
                     <p>Of all the Passions that Princes are
subject to, Love is the most powerful,
and may boast of more triumphs than
all the rest; and though it is said that
fruition diminishes it, that of <hi>Ibrahim</hi>
manifested the contrary, for by the
possession of his new Favourite, he
became more, and more inflamed:
and his kindness increasing every day,
contributed to <hi>Bassées</hi> good Fortune.
The next morning she had eight wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
four Eunuchs, and four Cooks
added to her train.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sultan</hi> sent her six Baskets full
of very rich Presents, with a Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
stored with many thousand She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kines,
augmenting her allowance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
to his kindness; and not
thinking this sufficient, he would
have her Train as great as that of the
<hi>Sultana Zaime;</hi> so that he gave her
more Eunuchs, and made up her num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of women sixteen. He furnished
a private Apartment for her with the
best Furniture in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> where he
often did her the honour to eat with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51472:24"/>
her. The compliant humour of this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
diverted his natural melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly;
she would sometimes prevail
with him to walk by the Sea-side, and
to hunt in the neighbouring Fields.</p>
                     <p>At last the Eunuch <hi>Zomboul</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her to be with Child, he carried
the news of it to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi>
who took a Diamond of a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
off from his finger to make her a
Present of; and not being able lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to contein his Joy, went him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to congratulate her, that she was
become the depository of a Pledge so
important to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire:
afterwards he visited the <hi>Sultana Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide,</hi>
to rejoyce with her. <hi>Zaime</hi> was
quickly informed of it, and the news
had like to have kill'd her; she found
her self ready to lie down, which
spoiled hers and the <hi>Sultana Valide</hi>'s
design. The time having deceived
them, there not remaining enough to
make <hi>Ibrahim</hi> believe that he was the
Father of her Child. The <hi>Sultana
Kiosem</hi> being one of the most subtle,
ingenious Princesses that ever was,
would not quite ruine <hi>Zaime,</hi> whom
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51472:24"/>
she tenderly loved, nor expose a Child
of <hi>Amurath;</hi> for she made no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> when he should
come to know the truth, would sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<hi>Zaime</hi>'s Child to his own safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Therefore she resolved to keep
her lying in secret, and to convey the
Child out of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> by some tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
person. They could think of no
body fitter to be trusted with so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
a secret than <hi>Fatima,</hi> who was
immediately sent for: She was ready
to lie in her self, which served as a
pretence for her coming to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
whither the women of Quality
often come to lay their great bellies.
She was no sooner arrived, but she fell
in labour; and a little while after, the
<hi>Sultana Zaime</hi> was brought to bed of a
Daughter, which she put into <hi>Fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s
hands, desiring her to have as
much care of her, as if she were her
own. <hi>Fatima</hi> acquitted her self ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
handsomely of her Charge, and
brought up this Princess in her own
house, under the name of <hi>Iohaime:</hi>
She had a Son, who looked on her as
his Sister, and was suffered to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51472:25"/>
in his error a great while, as we
shall see hereafter when we come to
his History.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the <hi>Sultana Zaime</hi>
being freed from the apprehensions of
her great belly, appeared more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
than ever, which had some effect
on the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> but she could
not quite regain him: he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in his affection to the <hi>Sultana Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sée,</hi>
whose happiness made all those
who pretended to his favour, jealous,
and almost desperate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zaime,</hi> whose loss was the greatest,
was most afflicted; nor did she neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
any means to destroy her Rival,
who alone had banished her out of
<hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s heart. The <hi>Sultan</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her jealousie, and knowing her
to be newly with Child by him, out
of the apprehension he had of her wit
and great power, endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
her to the <hi>Sultana Bassée.</hi> The
two <hi>Sultana</hi>'s willing to please <hi>Ibrahim</hi>
by their obedience, seemed to have
stifled their jealousie, which put the
<hi>Sultan</hi> into such transports of Joy, as
nothing could augment but the birth
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51472:25"/>
of two Princes, which the two Rivals
almost at the same time were brought
to bed of. He now renewed the vow
which he had before made of sending
one of his Children to <hi>Mecha,</hi> to give
the Prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi> thanks for the
favour which he believed Heaven
had bestowed on him by his interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
But as if the fruitfulness of
<hi>Zaime</hi> and <hi>Bassée</hi> had distasted him, he
took off his affection from them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
them only a place in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem,
and ingaged himself in new
amours, which manifested the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
of his humour. Ever since this
Prince had let loose the reins to his
Passions, his counterfeit, or natural
sweetness degenerated into extreme
effeminacy, and a bloody brutality.
He began to despise those who ought
to have been most dear to him, as the
<hi>Sultana Valide</hi> his Mother, the <hi>Mufti,</hi>
and <hi>Zomboul</hi> his protector. He put to
death his <hi>Grand Visier Mustapha Bassa,</hi>
and <hi>Salik Pacha</hi> who succeeded him,
soon after had the same fate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Cappigi Bassa</hi> after the great services
he had done him, had no better for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51472:26"/>
than the rest; he caused the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain
<hi>Bassa</hi> General of the Sea, to be
strangled for answering him freely in
an important affair.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> lost his
head for the insolence of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
who complained openly of the
effeminacy, and cruelty of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.
He was so fearful that he
would put the most considerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the Empire to death upon the
least suspicion. He craftily invited
the <hi>Cham</hi> of the <hi>Tartars</hi> to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
and beheaded him for saying,
that if his Highness should die with-Children,
he should inherit the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire, which belonged to him
of right by <hi>Sultan Amurath</hi>'s Will,
the Constitutions of the Empire, and
the Laws of the <hi>Musulmans.</hi> These
cruelties made him odious to the
Grandees of the Port, and the chief
of the <hi>Seraglio;</hi> of which number
were the <hi>Sultana Valide,</hi> the Eunuch
<hi>Zomboul,</hi> and the <hi>Mufti.</hi> Several <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>'s
revolted, but they were suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by <hi>Mehemet Bassa</hi> of <hi>Damas,</hi> who
was made <hi>Grand Visier,</hi> though he
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51472:26"/>
could neither write nor read. All the
Rebels were deprived of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments;
that of <hi>Aleppo</hi> was given
to <hi>Mahomet Coprogli,</hi> who relinquished
that of <hi>Baruth,</hi> to his sworn enemy
<hi>Zelim Achmet,</hi> who by his Intrigues at
the Port had hitherto preserved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
The <hi>Ianizaries</hi> and <hi>Spahies</hi> which
are the two most considerable orders
of the Turkish Militia, raised several
tumults one after another, which were
quieted again by giving them money.
At last the <hi>Mufti,</hi> the new <hi>Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier,</hi>
and the principals of the Court,
being weary of <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s cruelty, and
ill administration, resolved to rid
themselves of him; but fearing lest
if he should discover their conspiracy,
he would secure himself by the death
of his own Children, that he only
might survive of his race, and so save
himself by the general necessity of the
State, because the Turks cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to have any other Emperours but
what are of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family.
They agreed before they undertook
any thing to make sure of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or at least to get one of them
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51472:27"/>
out of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> whom they might
have in their own power. The best
expedient they could think of to
bring this design about, was to let the
<hi>Sultan</hi> know by the <hi>Mufti,</hi> that he was
indispensably oblig'd to accomplish
the vow he had made while he had
no children, of sending one of his
Sons to <hi>Mecha;</hi> assuring him that if
he delay'd it any longer he would
bring the wrath of Heaven upon him,
and by declaring himself a transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
of the Law, might cause an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
revolt. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> who was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
very timorous, yielded to the
<hi>Mufti</hi>'s perswasions, sticking only at
the choice of him whom he ought to
send. The voyage being very long,
the confidence he had in his Prophet,
could not free him from his fear, lest
some ill accident should befal the
young Pilgrim: he would not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
his eldest Son by the <hi>Sultana Bassée,</hi>
who was then about three years old,
but was more inclined to send Prince
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> then but thirty months old,
whom he had by <hi>Zaime,</hi> who feigned
her self to be with child again. She
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51472:27"/>
was not informed of the conspiracy,
and knowing the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> design,
she told him, she would not leave her
Son, and that the inconvenience of
her great belly would not permit her
to accompany him in so dangerous a
voyage. Perhaps her jealousie fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
her with this pretence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
her Rival from the <hi>Seraglio:</hi> on
the other side <hi>Bassée</hi> knowing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy,
solicited the <hi>Sultan</hi> to let her
conduct Prince <hi>Ottoman</hi> his Son to the
Temple of their Prophet; alledging
that his eldest Son ought to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
his vow.</p>
                     <p>The extreme care she had to free
her Son from the tempest which she
saw ready to fall on the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and
her desire to leave a place where she
believed she had been poisoned, made
her the more earnest to go, being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
by the <hi>Mufti,</hi> who assured <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi>
that he ought to send the eldest of
his children: So that the <hi>Sultan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pressed by such strong arguments,
yielded against his will to superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a Mothers tenderness. He
immediately gave order to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51472:28"/>
of the Sea, to equip the strongest
Gally he could find. There was one
of a prodigious bigness, which was
not quite finished. The Captain <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>
sent him word that it would require
some time before she could be sit to
put to Sea: But <hi>Ibrahim</hi> who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
importun'd, said, that if she
were not ready to sail in four days,
his head should pay for his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence:
in the mean while he imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the little time prescribed for their
departure, in ordering all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for their voyage, intending
they should imbark with the greatest
splendor and pomp that had ever been
seen.</p>
                     <p>The day assigned being come, the
<hi>Sultana Bassée</hi> who was otherwise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed,
was more sensibly troubled
to depart without her dear Confident
<hi>Zomboul,</hi> who had discovered the plot
to her, and desired her to provide for
her own, and her Sons safety by quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the <hi>Seraglio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Eunuch had the charge of
<hi>Ibrahim</hi> when he was in prison, and
had not only counsell'd him to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51472:28"/>
himself mad, to avoid his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
cruelty, (who otherwise would
have murdered him with the rest of
his Brothers) but he preserved his
life when the Emperor commanded
him to dispatch him secretly. Yet
<hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> was so ingrateful to
<hi>Zomboul,</hi> that after he had put him
out of his place of <hi>Capi Aga,</hi> he often
threatned him with death; so that
his resentment made him joy with
those who conspired his ruine: and
foreseeing the approaching revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he was willing to secure his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
by following the young Prince,
who in all likelihood would soon
come to be Emperour. The <hi>Sultana
Bassée</hi> just before she went away, when
she took her leave of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> cast
her self at his feet, with tears in her
eyes, to implore the last favour that
she should ever ask of him, on which
the happiness of her life depended.
The Emperor moved by her tears,
presently lifted her up, and promised
to grant what ever she would request.
<q>Sir, said she, I ask <hi>Zomboul</hi> of you,
to accompany me in my voyage. I
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51472:29"/>
know well enough that I shall rob
you of a faithful servant; but when
you consider it is for the service of
your Son, and a Mother afflicted by
so cruel a separation, I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
you will not refuse me this last
grace.</q> 
                        <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was a little surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
at this unexpected complement;
he could hardly think of parting with
a Slave to whom he owed his life,
and one whom he believed the most
faithful of all his Officers: but he
had promised, and that to a person
who was dear to him for his Sons
sake; therefore he ordered <hi>Zomboul</hi>
to be ready to part the next day, and
gave him the general command of the
conduct of the voyage. He would
have their departure kept secret, to
which end about midnight, the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana
Bassée,</hi> Prince <hi>Osman</hi> her Son, and
her Servants being let out at the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
gate of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> came himself in a disguise to
the Sea-side, to give the <hi>Sultana,</hi> and
her Son his last kisses. This Princess
answered the <hi>Sultan's</hi> tenderness in
such a manner as would have inspired
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51472:29"/>
the most insensible Soul with love and
sorrow, <q>Farewel Sir, said she with
a languishing voice, you will never
see me more, for I am poisoned by
my perfidious Rival.</q> After these
words she went abord the Gally, and
set sail, leaving <hi>Ibrahim</hi> in a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
which continued upon him for
many days. Her last words were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
in his Soul, and perhaps he
would presently have made <hi>Zaime</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of his displeasure, had he not
believed her to be with child, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his desire to leave a great many
children behind him. This inclined
him to wait till after her delivery, to
punish her for what she was unjustly
accused of. <hi>Bassée</hi> who it may be had
been poisoned by some body else, was
vexed to leave her <hi>Rival</hi> in the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio,</hi>
although she had been promised
that she, and her Son <hi>Mahomet</hi> should
be involved in the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.
She would rather have had her
fall by the <hi>Sultans</hi> own hand, and this
made her defame this Princess,
who has given too sublime marks of
her virtue, to let the world so much
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51472:30"/>
as suspect her of so base a crime.</p>
                     <p>Those who had conspired the death
of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> deferred the execution of
their design, till <hi>Bassée</hi> and her Son
were arrived at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> but the
Gally which carried them, being met
near the Isle of <hi>Rhodes</hi> by the Gallies
of <hi>Malta,</hi> commanded by <hi>Boisbaudran</hi>
the General of the Gallies of that fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
was assaulted, and made a
long and a valiant resistance, in which
the <hi>Aga Zomboul</hi> after he had given
proofs of an extraordinary courage,
and done all that a brave man, and a
wise Captain could do on such an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
was shot through the body
with a Musket bullet, which disabled
him from fighting any longer. He
caused himself to be carried down to
the <hi>Sultana's</hi> Cabin, where having
called the Captains to him, he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled
them to compound with the
Enemy: then kissing young <hi>Osman's</hi>
hand, and taking leave of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he made them carry him up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
into the fight, where he incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
the Souldiers to the very last.
His death disheartned the Turks, so
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51472:30"/>
that the Knights soon became masters
of the Vessel; but the Prize cost
the Victors dear. General <hi>Boisbaudran</hi>
performing the part of a great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
died of a Musket shot in his
breast. <hi>Piancourt,</hi> great Steward to the
Grand Master of <hi>Maltha,</hi> and Captain
of the St. <hi>Mary,</hi> was slain as he was
drawing an arrow out of his hand:
and Monsieur <hi>d' Albigre</hi> a Novice of
great hopes, lost his life there, with
many more gallant Knights. The
great booty was but an inconsiderable
recompence for the loss of so many
brave men. The <hi>Sultana,</hi> and the
Prince her Son, with their train
were conducted to
the Isle of <hi>Malta;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">An. 1644.</note>
and the news be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought to <hi>Constantinople</hi> made
the Conspirators defer their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> received the news
with inexpressible sorrow, but when
he heard that his dear <hi>Bassée</hi> was dead,
his grief grew so excessive that he
was almost distracted. He continued
several days without speaking to any
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51472:31"/>
body; and upon coming a little
to himself, he remembred <hi>Bassée's</hi>
last words at her departure; which
plunged him again into his former
despair. He commanded <hi>Zaime</hi> to
be brought to him, who apprehending
his cruelty, took young <hi>Mahomet</hi>
along with her, who was then look'd
upon as heir to the Empire, that she
might allay the Fathers fury by the
presence of his Son: but he would
have revenged himself on the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the Son too, if they had
not been delivered out of his hands.
As soon as he beheld <hi>Zaime,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
her with her treachery, and
without hearing her justification,
which she was ready to make on her
knees: he had thrust his Dagger into
her breast, if young <hi>Mahomet</hi> had not
staid his hand, and received the
stroke which he intended to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
his Mother. Hers and the Childs
cries brought the <hi>Sultana Valide,</hi> and
some Officers to the place, who freed
them from the danger they were in.
The young Prince was hurt above the
right eye, where he has yet a great
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51472:31"/>
scar; which a modern Historian im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
to the scratch of a Diamond,
which <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had on one day when he
gave him a box on the ear. However
it was, this action made a great noise
in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and alarm'd all the
City. Every body thought that the
Heir of the Empire was dead; and
<hi>Ibrahim</hi> himself was induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it by the pains that the <hi>Sultana</hi>
took to publish it, and her making a
magnificent Funeral for him, which
filled the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and the Town with
mourning.</p>
                     <p>He was the only man that shewed
no sorrow for so deplorable an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
which made him more hated
than before. He sought to comfort
himself for the death of his beloved
<hi>Sultana,</hi> and the taking of his eldest
Son, by the furious War which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
against <hi>Malta.</hi> He swore to
ruine that famous Island, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
all the Kinghts that should come
into his power: and having learn'd
that they were French Knights that
took his Gally, he could hardly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
violating the person of the <hi>Sieur
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51472:32"/>
de Harley,</hi> Count of <hi>Cis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> then Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador
of <hi>France,</hi> at the Port, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to <hi>Pera</hi> to escape his fury. He
would have massacred all the French
in his Dominions, if the <hi>Aga</hi> of the
Eunuchs who was very powerful with
him, had not hinder'd him by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances
that had very near cost
him his life. His cruelty augmenting
more and more, fell upon the chief
Officers of the Empire. One <hi>Hussein</hi>
whom from a poor Shepherd the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
had raised to an eminent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because during his confinement
he had diverted him with his Pipe,
and Country Songs, feeding his Sheep
near the Prison, helped to nourish his
brutish passions. The <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
gave credit to none but this man,
who being jealous of the authority of
the Grandees of the Port, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to build his reputation on the
ruine of their fortune. To this end,
he caused <hi>Mahomet</hi> the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> to
be strangled, for going about to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the <hi>Grand Signor</hi> from the War
of <hi>Malta,</hi> the event of which he
judged to be very dangerous. This
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51472:32"/>
wholsom advice was the reason of
his death, which was followed by
that of <hi>Bekir,</hi> Captain General of the
Sea; but whatsoever is too violent
cannot last long. <hi>Zelim Achmet,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Baruth, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
Coprogli</hi>'s enemy was made <hi>Grand
Visier</hi> by the favour of the Traitor
<hi>Hussain,</hi> who was his particular friend;
either made so by presents, or that
the sympathy of their ill nature had
begot their friendship. <hi>Achmet</hi> was
no sooner raised to this high charge,
but he thought of overthrowing all
those whose fortune gave him any su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicion.
He wanted but little of ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Valide,</hi> and <hi>Zaime,</hi> by the counsel
he gave the Emperour, because they
had heretofore thwarted his interest.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sultan</hi> who had resolved what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it cost him to be revenged on
the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> seeing himself
disswaded from that expedition,
that his great preparations might not
be fruitless, chose the Isle of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
and the Dominions of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
to be the object of his venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
sending all his Forces to the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51472:33"/>
conquest of the ancient Kingdom of
<hi>Crete,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Mahomet
Bassa,</hi> who commanded the Land Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and of <hi>Saffi,</hi> who in right of his
charge of Captain General of the
Sea, which <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had bestowed on
him after the death of <hi>Bekir</hi> who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<hi>Pial,</hi> commanded the Fleet.
These Generals attacked <hi>Canea,</hi> and
took it, notwithstanding the vigorous
resistance of the Governour <hi>Antonio
Navario,</hi> and the succours which <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea
Cornaro</hi> the General of <hi>Candy</hi> sent
thither, under the Colonels <hi>Angeli</hi>
and <hi>Iustiniani,</hi> who signalized their
address and courage, on this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as they have done on a thousand
others. They continued the War
three years with great disadvantage,
and with such excessive charge, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted
<hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Coffers, without
making any great progress; which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proceeded from the <hi>Venetians</hi> cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
defence, or from the frequent
change of the Generals, who out of
jealousie, or vanity, acted quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their predecessors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:51472:33"/>
In the mean time the Army requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
continual supplies of necessary
provision, and the General <hi>Vssain Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>
was very importunate for money
to maintain his Troops; which not
being sent, he suffered the Janizaries
who were in <hi>Candy</hi> to return to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>
to demand their pay, and be
relieved by their Companions; who
seeing those who came back so ill sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
refused to embarque unless
they were paid beforehand, which so
provoked the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> that he
threatned the <hi>Grand Visier Achmet</hi> with
the loss of his head, if he did not find
money to carry on the War. This
base Minister was glad of this absolute
order, which was a sufficient pretence
for him to lay extraordinary impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on the people, and to spoil all
those <hi>Bassa's</hi> and Governours of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
of their riches, whose power
he either suspected, or envied. To
this purpose he summoned several of
them to give an account to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers
of the Exchequer, not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>Mahomet Coprogli,</hi> whom he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned,
with a great many more, as
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51472:34"/>
innocent as himself. But he set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
particularly to persecute him,
whom he had now gotten into the
snare which he had so long laid for
him. He thought he had now met
with a lucky opportunity of reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the affronts he had received from
him, both in his love, and his fortune.
He no longer feared the <hi>Sultana Zaime,</hi>
who had ever protected his enemy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
whom he had maliciously fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> displeasure
since the death of the <hi>Sultana Bassée;</hi>
and he already beheld the ruine of
unfortunate <hi>Mahomet</hi> with pleasure:
but to accomplish his vengeance he
had a mind to make him perish shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
by accusing him, as well as the
rest of the <hi>Bassa's</hi> and <hi>Beys</hi> (whom he
had imprisoned) of extortion, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine.
Though <hi>Mahomet Coprogli</hi> was
innocent, his behaviour having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
been unblameable; yet he could
not but apprehend so dangerous an
enemy, who without doubt would
have brought his pernicious design to
pass, if he had not been obliged to
neglect his revenge, to take care of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51472:34"/>
his own life, which was odious to all
the world. The injustice of this <hi>Grand
Visier,</hi> and the crimes which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
every day by sending persons
of all ages and conditions to executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
on the least suspicion, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
without any other ground,
than the satisfaction of his Hatred,
and Avarice, or the keeping up of his
Authority, were not to be indured.
The Grandees of the Empire, the
<hi>Mufti,</hi> and the <hi>Sultana Valide</hi> her self
thought it not fit to defer the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of their design any longer.
They foresaw the ruine of the State,
if the Government should continue in
the hands of such a lewd hairbrain'd
Emperor, who committed the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Authority of the powerfullest
Empire in the world, to two of the
basest Ministers that ever mannaged
publick Affairs. They resolved to
take away the root of all the mischiefs
that threatned them, by depriving an
unworthy Prince of his Power, and
by punishing the crimes of the <hi>Grand
Visier Achmet,</hi> and the Traytor <hi>Hussein.</hi>
The people, and the Janizaries were
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51472:35"/>
easily brought into the Conspiracy,
being both weary of the Tyranny.
The people were so oppressed by the
<hi>Grand Visier,</hi> and the Souldiers so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
for want of their pay, that
they offered to set the <hi>Seraglio</hi> on fire.
The <hi>Mufti,</hi> Who is the chief Priest of
the Turkish Law, the <hi>Kadileskess</hi> who
are the Judges, the <hi>Visiers</hi> and <hi>Bassa's</hi>
who are the Chancellors of State, and
Intendents of Provinces, the <hi>Aga</hi> of
the Janizaries, who is Colonel of all
the Infantry, the <hi>Captain</hi> who is Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
of the Sea, and generally all
the principal Officers revolted with
one accord. The Sedition was begun
by the request which the <hi>Mufti</hi> made
to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> in the name of the whole
State, to have the <hi>Grand Visier Achmet</hi>
punished. The <hi>Sultan</hi> provoked by
this boldness, commanded his Guard
to chastise the Mutineers for making
such an impudent proposition; but
the Janizaries were too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
to obey him; which forced
him to flie to the <hi>Sultana Valide,</hi> his
Mother, who had fomented the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
that she might revenge the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51472:35"/>
wrongs she had suffered from her Son
by the counsel of the <hi>Grand Visier,</hi>
whom with the Traitor <hi>Hussein, Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi>
delivered up to the people to be
torn in pieces; naming <hi>Mahomet</hi> a
popular man who was threescore and
ten years old, to supply his place, not
being able to appease the Rebels any
other way. But they were not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with this, they would have <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi>
himself come and render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of his actions before the <hi>Mufti,</hi>
who summoned him before the <hi>Divan</hi>
or Consul, by sending a <hi>Kadilesker</hi> to
him, whom the <hi>Sultan</hi> slighted, and
tore the <hi>Fetfa,</hi> which is a summons
to appear before the Judges. This
being reiterated in vain, the <hi>Mufti,</hi>
with the <hi>Visiers,</hi> the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> and other
Officers went to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and took
him by force out of his Mothers
arms, and carried him to the prison,
in which he was brought
up; where ten days after
he was Strangled,<note place="margin">An. 1648.</note> his
Son <hi>Mahomet</hi> who was
then about seven years old,<note place="margin">Aug. 18.</note> being
placed in the Imperial Throne, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51472:36"/>
publickly proclaimed Emperor of the
Turks, and his Mother <hi>Zaime,</hi> Regent,
during his minority.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sultana</hi> was assisted by a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of twelve <hi>Bassa's,</hi> who were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
with her concerning Affairs of
State; in which she was so well ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that she soon obtained Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
enough to make any thing pass in
the <hi>Divan,</hi> which she had resolved in
her Closet, and discharged the <hi>Grand
Visier</hi> of a great deal of trouble which
she was willing to take upon her self.
And not long after, the <hi>Visier</hi> died,
leaving the <hi>Sultana</hi> at liberty to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
his place on one of her own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                     <p>However she was forced to use
great caution, in the choice of this
Minister, Policy instructed her not
to raise one that might intrench up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her power, or one who by displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Grandees, and the People,
might render her odious to them
both. She had fresh examples before
her eyes, of the fatal consequence of
such Elections, and of the dangers
that the <hi>Sultans</hi> were exposed to by
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51472:36"/>
the imprudence of their Ministers.
Dissimulation is a virtue in Princes;
she had already formed her design in
her head, nothing remaining but to
put it handsomly in execution; to
which end, she caused the <hi>Divan</hi> or
Council of State of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
to be assembled; to which the
<hi>Mufti,</hi> and all the great men of the
Port were summoned. She repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to them that by the death of
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> the Office of the <hi>Visier Azem</hi>
was vacant in a time, that consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great Wars he was ingaged in
with his most cruel Enemies, more
than every required an able and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
Minister to support the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who could not in
many years be capable of taking care
of his Empire himself. She told them
that the Treasures were exhausted,
and that she had brought them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to take their advice in such
pressing necessities: adding, that it
was requisite to re-establish the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Taxes, without oppressing the
people, who had suffered so much in
the last Emperors time, that they
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51472:37"/>
must not think of laying new imposts
on them. She protested to them that
she would wholly resign her self up to
their counsel, in the sovereign admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
which the <hi>Divan</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
on her (an honour that had not
been done to any <hi>Sultana</hi> before her)
especially since it was composed of
persons so well able to govern as they
were. At last she concluded her dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with a command to them to
give their votes for him whom they
thought fittest to be her partner in
power, and Lieutenant General of the
Empire. She foresaw that by this
means she should make the <hi>Visiers</hi> and
<hi>Bassa</hi>'s so jealous of one another, that
they would not resolve to choose any
particular man, which was the thing
she wished; and it fell out according
to her expectation: for all those who
aspired to the place, being ashamed to
ask it, were unwilling to give their
votes for another: and when she
pressed them to declare themselves,
they very submissively desired her to
make the choice her self, since what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
liberty she had given them of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51472:37"/>
electing a <hi>Grand Visier,</hi> yet there could
be none but such a one as she should
approve; which inclined them rather
to deserve her favour by their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
The <hi>Grand Sultana</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
their meaning, was glad to see
her designs succeed so well. She as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
them she would not abuse the
trust they reposed in her, and that she
would make such a choice as should
be to their satisfaction, and to ingage
them the more, she told them it was
necessary to supply those Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which were vacant, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the accusations of those <hi>Bassa's,
Beys,</hi> and <hi>Sangiacks,</hi> whom <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had
imprison'd before his death, some for
Rapine, others for imbezelling the
Publick Treasure, that the innocent
might be freed, and the guilty puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
This was a nice proposition,
and sensibly touched those <hi>Visiers</hi> and
<hi>Bassa's</hi> who protected the prisoners,
and had contributed to <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
But the <hi>Sultana</hi> was glad
to find this means to reproach them
with the death of her Husband, and
to oblige them to give her some satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<q>
                           <pb n="50" facs="tcp:51472:38"/>
Since the love of your
Country, and the interest of State,
said she, caused you to remedy the
disorders of the Government, by
summoning my Lord, and your
Emperour to the Tribunal, you
ought to continue your justice to
all the world, by relieving the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
who indure those pains
which are only due to the criminal:
and it were of odious example if
they should escape that punishment
to which you condemned an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
who certainly was not faulty, if
you think those whose Sentence you
defer, innocent.</q> As she said these
words, she let fall some tears, which
she presently wiped away, for fear of
provoking those, whom she intended
to mannage to her advantage. She
added, <q>That although Sovereigns
are above all Laws, and Subjects
have no power to call them to an
account of their actions, yet the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
her Son would forget what was
passed, and she would sacrifice all
her resentment to the furtherance
of that Justice,</q> which she doubted
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51472:38"/>
not but they would render to those
who expected it from them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sultanas</hi> discourse was very sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising
to the <hi>Visiers,</hi> and the <hi>Bassa's,</hi>
who had rather have set the Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
at liberty, without any farther
inquiry. But the <hi>Divan</hi> was concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in honour to approve of her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
lest they should be thought to
exercise their Justice on none but
their Princes. Commissioners there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were named to go along with the
<hi>Nectangi</hi> or Secretary of State, and
the <hi>Tefterdar</hi> or Treasurer General of
the Revenue, to visit the Prisons.
There they found <hi>Mahomet Coprogli,</hi>
who seeing himself among a great
many Criminals, had insinuated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
so into his companions in misery,
that with too much freedom they
made him, whom they believed as
guilty as themselves, the confident of
their crimes: but he did it with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to make an advantage of their ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
either of his own accord, or
by the command of the <hi>Sultana,</hi> who
made use of this invention as a means
to promote him to that dignity which
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51472:39"/>
she intended for him. She knew
where his prison was as soon as he was
led thither, and <hi>Fatima</hi> who was very
dear to her because of the care she
took in the Education of the Princess
<hi>Iohaime</hi> her Daughter, continually so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited
her to use her Authority in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
her Husband at liberty, which
she could not do, being her self in
disgrace at that time. However she
might have freed him as soon as she
was possessed of the Sovereign Power,
but it was <hi>Coprogli</hi>'s interest to remain
in prison then, when his enlargement
would have been fatal to him, because
of the Sedition of the Janizaries,
who having already murdered some
of the chief of the Port, would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
have destroyed him to have
weaken'd <hi>Zaime</hi>'s party. She esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him not only for his Wifes sake,
but for his own merit, and left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
undone to preserve him. She
secretly disposed the Commissioners
to inform themselves particularly of
<hi>Mahomet Coprogli</hi>'s case, who behaved
himself so well, that every thing
seemed to fall out naturally: for when
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51472:39"/>
he had fully justified himself from all
the Crimes that were laid to his
charge, he demanded with submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which yet shewed his courage,
and the greatness of his soul, whether
his death was decreed. <q>I am ready,
said he, to suffer it with patience
though my life might perhaps be
very useful to the State: wherefore
I desire my Judges to lead me to the
<hi>Sultan</hi> before I go to Execution, that
I may acquaint him with a secret,
which I will discover to none but
his Highness, or the <hi>Great Sultana.</hi>
                        </q>
These speeches were reported in full
<hi>Divan,</hi> where the <hi>Mufti,</hi> the <hi>Visiers,</hi>
and the <hi>Bassa's</hi> knowing <hi>Zaime</hi> had a
kindness for <hi>Coprogli,</hi> desired her ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly,
to be just to so brave a man,
to hear what he had to say, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
his merit. She willing to take
the advantage of their zeal, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
her design, commanded them
to send for that important man who
had the applause of the whole <hi>Divan.
Coprogli,</hi> when he came, by his good
<hi>Min,</hi> and eloquence, confirmed the
opinion that had been conceived of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51472:40"/>
him: and the <hi>Grand Sultana,</hi> after she
had inlarged upon the report that had
been made her of his virtue and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
asked him what it was he had to
impart to his Highness. And when
she had learn'd that it was an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
expedient to replenish the <hi>Grand
Signiors</hi> Coffers without oppressing
the people, or raising new Taxes, she
declared him <hi>Visier Azem</hi> by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and the <hi>Divan.</hi>
The whole Assembly was exceedingly
astonished at this, having never so
much as dreamt, that <hi>Coprogli</hi> should
have been brought out of prison to
be raised to the first charge of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
But the <hi>Visiers</hi> had consented
to it themselves, by the information
they had given the <hi>Sultana</hi> in favour
of him whom she named. Every one
murmured secretly, though they did
not complain; and
<hi>Coprogli</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="margin">He receives the Seal of the Empire the 5th. of <hi>February,</hi> 1649.</note> received
from <hi>Zaime's</hi> hand
the golden Box, in
which was the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi>'s Seal, which it was his Office to keep.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:51472:40"/>
Here was an extraordinary change,
<hi>Mahomet</hi> who a little before was laden
with irons, is freed from them to take
upon him the Government of the most
powerful Empire in the world; and
what is more admirable, the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his fortune wrought no change
in his manners: he was not at all daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the splendor of those honours
which were heaped on him, but esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
the foundation of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
by his discretion. He was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placent
to the Great Men, merciful to
the People, and equally just to all, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it appear that he was truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of his charge, which he began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
by restoring several good Laws,
which the late disorders had interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted.
He made every one to do his
duty, terrifying the Magistrates by
the sentence which he pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Bassa</hi>'s who were left in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
where while he was their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
he had dived into their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets,
and found none of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.
The Crimes they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
of were of such a nature, as
could not be pardoned without great
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51472:41"/>
prejudice to the State. He had given
marks of the gentleness of his nature
while he was Governour of <hi>Baruth</hi> and
<hi>Aleppo,</hi> and the people of those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
knew him not to be inclined to
bloodshed: but he was now raised to
a charge that obliged him to force his
inclination. All the <hi>Bassa's, Beys,</hi> and
<hi>Sangiacks</hi> who were found guilty of
Extortion, Rapine, or Treason, were
condemned to death. And that the
punishment of these Crimes might
serve as an example to all the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the Empire, and a pattern of
exact Justice to the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> He
got into his hands the wealth of the
<hi>Bassa's,</hi> who had been executed, and
set up two Tables in the Hall, through
which the <hi>Sultan</hi> was to pass to go
to the <hi>Devan.</hi> On one of them he
placed twenty of the principal heads
that had been cut off, and covered
them with a great mourning Carpet;
and on the other he set a great many
rich Purses full of Gold and Precious
Stones, which was covered with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Carpet, imbroidered with Gold
and Pearls; and then waited for the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51472:41"/>
                        <hi>Sultan</hi> and his Mothers coming to the
<hi>Divan,</hi> to shew them this strange spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle.
The great <hi>Sultana</hi> presently
had a mind to know, to what end
those preparations were, and what
was under the Carpets; one of which
the Prince her Son, without staying
for an answer, lifted up, and in a
fright asked what those heads did
there? <q>Sir, replied <hi>Mahomet Copro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli,</hi>
directing his speech to him,
they vomit up the blood of your
Subjects, which they have sucked
from them, and which, continued
he lifting up the Carpet, you may
see in these Purses: It is fit that
Robbers should be punished: those
men who have destroyed so many
by their cruelty, and avarice, who
have robbed so many innocent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
are at last stripped themselves,
and have rendred that money of
which they have defrauded you.</q> This
proceeding seemed a little bloody,
and made it feared that his admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
would be very severe; but
he regulated his actions with so much
Justice, that he never put any man
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51472:42"/>
to death, unless he certainly knew
that he deserved it.</p>
                     <p>The chief scope of this <hi>Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier</hi>
was to raise his Princes Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
weaken'd of late by the frequent
Seditions of the Janizaries, whose
insolence he endeavoured to curb for
the establishment of his own fortune
too. He told them they were unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of being inrolled, and receiving
pay, if they were not in condition to
serve, and ready to obey the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
orders. But they instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
satisfied with the death of <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi>
thought to take the advantage
of <hi>Sultan Mahomet's</hi> youth; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> was as
weak, and timorous, as his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
whom they had either murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or deposed; they slighted his
commands, and refused to pass into
<hi>Candy,</hi> alledging that the Janizaries
were priviledged from making War by
Sea, that they were not to march any
where without the Emperor, whom
they would not leave, for fear of
some innovation against him in their
absence. The <hi>Sultana Kiozem</hi> furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51472:42"/>
them with this pretence, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to compass a design which she had
contrived.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Sultana</hi> who had still the title
of <hi>Valide,</hi> was Grandmother to <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
the Fourth. She had contributed
to the death of her Son <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he took away the Authority
which she had usurped. She fancied
that since she had a share in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
in three Emperors Reigns,
she should have been made Regent of
the Empire, during her Grandsons
minority: but the Grandees of the
Port, and the <hi>Divan</hi> having conferred
the Sovereign Power on the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors</hi>
Mother, she was extremely offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to see the affairs of the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
Empire mannaged by a woman, who
owed her fortune and greatness to
her. She hoped that <hi>Zaime</hi> would sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
her Authority to her, but this
being too unreasonable and improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a wish to succeed, Ambition which
considers the extent of the desires,
more than of duty, made her think of
revenge. She thought of nothing but
how to execute her projects, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaired
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51472:43"/>
not yet to make her self abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Mistress of the Empire. To this
purpose she imparted her design to the
<hi>Kislar Agazi,</hi> who had always been
her confident; but he could not so
much as hear her Treason without
horror. <q>How Madam, said he to
her, in disorder, is it possible that
you would destroy a Princess who
honours you as her Queen, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
you as her Mother? could
you be so cruel as to kill young <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
Mahomet,</hi> because he is her Son?
is he not yours too? does not nature
it self speak in his behalf? No,
<hi>continued he,</hi> I will rather lose my
life than be an assistant in so foul an
enterprise.</q> Well, well, <hi>Vglan,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the malicious Princess (who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
how coldly the Eunuch enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
her proposition, bethought her
self of counterfeiting repentance, lest
he should betray her) <q>endeavour
then to restore my Authority, and
dispose <hi>Zaime</hi> to take me along with
her in the Regency; my advice will
be very advantagious to her, and I
will always behave my self like a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51472:43"/>
good Mother towards her.</q> The
<hi>Kislar Agazi</hi> promised her more than
she asked, and swore never to speak
of what she had imparted to him;
neither had he any time to do it: he
spoke with her in the beginning of the
night, and the next morning he was
found dead in his bed. No body
could tell how it came to pass, but
since that time it has been discovered,
that a Slave whom she had gained,
had blown poison into his Nose when
he was asleep. The death of this Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch
was exceedingly deplored by the
<hi>Great Sultana,</hi> who reflected on all the
good Offices he had done for her: and
she would have been more afflicted if
she could have comprehended the
greatness of her loss in him who
would have done her a more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
service than ever, if death had
not prevented him. The <hi>Grand Visier</hi>
who owed his fortune to him, and
looked on him as his Father, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressibly
grieved, and suspected
somewhat of the truth, but could not
guess at it all.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the <hi>Sultana Valide</hi>
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:51472:44"/>
lost no time; she had by great promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
ingaged the <hi>Aga</hi> of the Janizaries
to the <hi>Aga</hi> of the white Eunuchs, the
<hi>Bostangibachi,</hi> the Governour of the
Pages, called <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>hoglans,</hi> who are six
hundred of the handsomest young
men in the Empire, the Captain
General of the Seas, and some of the
most considerable <hi>Bassa's.</hi> She had so
disposed every thing, that her design
would infallibly have succeeded, if
Heaven which takes a particular care
of crowned heads, had not put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Visier Azems</hi> mind to go out of
his <hi>Seraglio</hi> at the beginning of the
night, and to pass through the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Town in disguise, with one
Slave only whom he trusted most, to
see what the Janizaries did, of whom
he had some apprehension, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well affected either to him, or the
Emperors service. He was much sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
to find them all in the <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drome</hi>
with their Muskets on their
shoulders, and their Matches lighted,
and Sentinels placed at all avenues.
He was presently stopt, his looks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
his intention of not being
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51472:44"/>
known, but he wanted not courage,
and on this occasion manifested the
presence of his mind. He asked with
a great deal of confidence for <hi>Bactas</hi>
the <hi>Aga</hi> of the Janizaries, and being
led to his <hi>Oda,</hi> was astonished at his
arrogance in not rising to salute him,
though he knew him very well; when
at another time he would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
himself before the <hi>Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier,</hi>
who never goes to see any body
but the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
a Visit, never rises to any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
but the <hi>Mufti.</hi> However he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
his thoughts at present,
knowing himself certainly lost if he
did not make use of some subtilty to
disingage himself from the danger he
was in. The <hi>Aga</hi> in the mean time
having made him sit down on his left
hand, which is the most honourable
place among the Turkish Souldiers,
was just going to ask him the cause of
his disguise, when <hi>Mahomet</hi> prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, <q>
                           <hi>Bactas,</hi> said he, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that you assembled your
Troops to night for some great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise:
I received this notice
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51472:45"/>
from the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> from persons
whom you know to be your chiefest
friends, and I disguised my self, for
fear of being known, to come and
learn of you what I should do for
your security, and my own.</q> 
                        <hi>Bactas</hi>
was struck speechless to hear that the
<hi>Grand Visier</hi> was informed of all the
Plot; he easily believed that he was
come on purpose to him to endeavour
his own preservation: and imagining
it would be a great advantage to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
this first Minister in the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,
he examin'd him a little, and
then discovered the whole design to
him; telling him, that he was to
make himself master of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi>
and seize on the young <hi>Sultan Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi>
whom he would either cause to
be strangled, or shut him up in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with his Mother; that all was
agreed on with the <hi>Sultana Valide,</hi> who
was to have the Regency of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
in the minority of Prince <hi>Soliman,</hi>
whom they would place on the Throne
instead of his Brother <hi>Mahomet:</hi> and
finally, if he had a mind to secure
his Authority and his life, he must
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51472:45"/>
necessarily be assistant to this change.
The <hi>Grand Visier</hi> demurred not one
minute to give his assent, making as
if he had been before informed of all
that <hi>Bactas</hi> told him, and expressed a
great deal of satisfaction that it was
in his power to serve the <hi>Sultana Valide</hi>
by imbracing her party, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to be the strongest. <hi>Bactas</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
himself to be wheadled by <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>progli's</hi>
promises, whom he obliged by
Oath to be faithful to the <hi>Sultana Kio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zem,</hi>
and as a pledge of his faith to
deliver his <hi>Boult,</hi> a Seal ingraven on
a Gold Ring, which the <hi>Grand Visier</hi>
always wears on his finger, (as a mark
of his Dignity and Power) into his
hands: then he sent him away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Guards, to go and assemble the
<hi>Divan</hi> secretly two hours after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
at which time he was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
order from the <hi>Sultana Valide</hi> to
enter the <hi>Seraglio</hi> with his Janizaries.
These insolent Souldiers were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
on the attempt, and were impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
to begin it, in hopes of rifling
the great Wealth, and inestimable
Treasures, which so many Emperors
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51472:46"/>
had heaped together in this voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Palace.</p>
                     <p>But heaven which abhors the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt
of Subjects against their Princes,
so blinded the Commander of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
Troops, that he let the <hi>Visier
Azem</hi> escape, by whose order soon
after, he and his Complices received
the punishment they deserved. <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
Coprogli</hi> had no sooner got loose
from him, but he went to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi>
where he was amazed to find the
Gates open, and most of the Guards
besotted with Wine, and Tobacco.
Some of them would have stopt him,
but he easily avoided that, by telling
them that he carried a Letter from
<hi>Bactas</hi> to the <hi>Sultan Kiosem.</hi> His habit
of a Slave protected him, and they
were so drunk that they could not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
him. Being passed them he ran
presently to the Apartment of <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Kislar Agazi,</hi> who succeeded the
Eunuch <hi>Vglan:</hi> but not finding him,
he went to that of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi>
by the way meeting with the great
Eunuch <hi>Soliman,</hi> who walked about
the Lodgings of the <hi>Sultana Valide,</hi>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:51472:46"/>
whom he mistrusted. He had that
very night found her privately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
with the <hi>Bostangibachi,</hi> and the
confusion the sight of him put them
into made him watch to avoid surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes;
fearing lest something was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
against the <hi>Grand Signior's</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
to whom he was very faithful.
He was no less astonished to see the
<hi>Visier Azem</hi> in that place, at such an
unusual hour, than <hi>Mahomet Coprogli</hi>
was to meet him. They presently
acquainted one another with what
they knew, and suspected, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
how to free the <hi>Seraglio</hi> from
the storm that threatned it. They
judged it expedient to advertise the
<hi>Sultan,</hi> and the Great <hi>Sultana,</hi> that
they might interpose their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
therefore they went straight to
the <hi>Grand Signior's</hi> Apartment, who
slept in his Mothers arms, and made
signs to the woman who watched by
them, to wake them both; which
they did without speaking: it being
an inviolable custom among the
Turks not to speak, out of respect in
the <hi>Seraglio</hi> in the night time, but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51472:47"/>
chiefly while the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> sleeps:
and it is a great crime whatsoever the
occasion be, to break silence in the
place where his Highness reposes. A
woman went near the <hi>Sultana's</hi> Bed,
and softly scratching her Feet, waked
her, who was surprized to see two
men she did not know at first. <q>Ah
my Son, said she, rising briskly,
and taking him in her arms, we are
lost.</q> The young Prince without any
fear looked on the <hi>Visier,</hi> and taking
him boldly by the hand, asked him
what was the matter, and if he were
come to save him. The <hi>Grand Visier</hi>
admiring the Princes Courage, threw
himself at his feet, and kissing his
hand, told him he need not fear any
thing, that the Traitors should do him
no mischief, and that his faithful ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
would prevent the Treason.
<q>But Madam (continued he, directing
his speech the <hi>Great Sultana)</hi> you
must make use of all your prudence
to avoid the danger that menaces
us all.</q> Then he sent for the <hi>Mufti</hi>
and signed a <hi>Catecherif</hi> or express
order of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51472:47"/>
Governour of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to
come immediately to his Highness.
He caused the Gates of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> to
be shut up, and commanded that none
should be let in or out without the
Emperors permission. The Captain
<hi>Bassa</hi> being come, he ordered him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
without noise to advertise the
Inhabitants of every quarter that
they should arm themselves, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricade
the Streets, and seize on the
Gates of the Town, that no body
might go out. He sent to the chief
of the <hi>Spahies, Solaquis,</hi> and <hi>Capighis</hi> to
come and watch about the <hi>Seraglio,</hi>
and secure the Emperor: five hundred
of them presently came, and the
<hi>Mufti,</hi> to heighten their courage by
zeal for their Religion, cited several
passages of <hi>Mahomet's</hi> Law, which
admonished them, that those who eat
the Princes bread, ought to expose
their lives for his service. And to
make his Harangue more effectual, he
distributed some Purses among them,
obliging them by Oath to die, if there
were occasion in the <hi>Sultan's</hi> defence.
In the mean time the <hi>Kislar Agazi</hi> had
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51472:48"/>
waked all the Eunuchs, and Officers
of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> to the very Cook, and
made them take Arms. The Pages
too were put into the same posture, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the seizure of the Eunuch their
Governour, the <hi>Bostangibachi,</hi> chief
Gardener of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> the <hi>Capi Aga</hi>
Captain of the Gates of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi>
and the <hi>Aga,</hi> or chief of the White
Eunuchs, who acknowled all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of the Conspiracy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
that the <hi>Sultana Valide</hi> had plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the <hi>Aga</hi> of the Janizaries,
and the principal Officers, to depose
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> and Crown his Brother <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
This Prince was the second of
four Sons which <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> had by
three Wives. <hi>Mahomet</hi> the eldest was
the Son of <hi>Zaime; Soliman</hi> his younger
Brother was the Son of the <hi>Sultana
Maiama;</hi> and <hi>Bajazet</hi> and <hi>Orchanes</hi>
were born of an <hi>Albanese. Maiama</hi> in
hopes of raising her Son <hi>Soliman</hi> to the
Empire, had promised the <hi>Sultana
Kiozem</hi> all the advantages that she
could desire, and her extravagant
ambition had made her neglect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that could bring those over to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51472:48"/>
her party, who might further her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.
Her chief pretence was,
that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was too weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy
to be capable of governing so
powerful an Empire: and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<hi>Zaime</hi> was too young and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
to supply his defects by her
prudent Conduct, and would never
be fit for so weighty an employment.
That on the contrary, Prince <hi>Soliman</hi>
was strong, handsome, and promising,
and would be able to take care of his
own Affairs, when she should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to leave them to him, by age, and
incapacity. Thus had she gained all
those we mentioned, who by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
diligence of the <hi>Visier Azem</hi>
were Arrested, he caused her Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be secured to prevent her es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape.
The <hi>Sultan</hi> though very young
had so much tenderness for his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother,
that he could not be brought
to sign a Warrant for her Death who
intended his: And his Mother was as
good natur'd as himself, being of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that she should only be imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
She reflected on their former
friendship, and her generosity out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51472:49"/>
the necessity of her wrong:
but her Virtue appeared not only in
behalf of the <hi>Sultana Kiozem,</hi> she was
moved with compassion also to her
Rival <hi>Maiama,</hi> who with her Son <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
was to have been punished with
the rest of the Conspirators.</p>
                     <p>She obtained their Pardon of the
<hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and the Ministers who
would have sacrificed her to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
safety: but she was forced to
yield to the Remonstrances of the
<hi>Mufti</hi> and other Officers, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
her and the <hi>Sultan</hi> too, that the
<hi>Sultana Kiozem's</hi> Death was absolutely
necessary to the good of the State,
and quiet of the Empire: so that her
Grandson <hi>Mahomet</hi> was obliged to
consent to her death. The <hi>Ichoglans,</hi>
Eunuchs, and some of the Souldiers,
out of a brutish zeal, undertook this
execution instead of the Mutes, and
running tumultuously to the old <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana's</hi>
Apartment, they could hardly
find her; for hearing she was looked
for, she hid her self in a Wardrobe,
under the cloaths; from whence
they pulled her out by the feet, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51472:49"/>
forgetting the Emperour's Orders,
who charged them to put her to no
pain, they treated her basely without
any respect to her Character or age.
She in vain endeavoured to stop their
insolence by fair words, and offers of
great sums of money; for without
hearkening to what she said, they drew
her by force out of her Chamber,
stript her, gave her several blows, and
tore her very ears for Pearls of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
greatness that hung in them.
She strugled a great while with them,
defending her self with extraordinary
vigour for a woman of her age, but
at last with much ado she was stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled.
Thus dyed this unhappy
Princess, after she had lived fourscore
years in the reigns of five Emperors.
She was of the Isle of <hi>Chios,</hi> nobly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended:
She had five Sons and two
Daughters by <hi>Sultan Achmet; Amurath,
Osman</hi> and <hi>Ibrahim</hi> sate on the Throne;
her two Daughters, with <hi>Bajazet</hi> and
<hi>Orchanes</hi> died by the hands of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners.
She seemed not to be above
fifty years old. Her Constitution was
wonderful, her great age had abated
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51472:50"/>
very little of her strength, and brought
no inconvenience at all along with it.
She had still some remains of beauty
that shewed her to have been the
handsomest woman of her time. Her
stature which was the most advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
in the world, did not incline her
to stoop; she was not grown too lean,
her gate was steady, her conversation
pleasing, her hair very thick, and the
change of the colour had taken away
very little of its grace. Her forehead
was not wrinkled, and her eyes were
very lively. Her teeth were still so
strong, that she bit off one of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
who went to take away a rich
Necklace she had on. She was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
very neat, her heart was magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
her inclination generous, her soul
great, resolute, and constant: she was
mistress of a thousand extraordinary
qualities, which had rendred her the
most admirable person of her Sex, if
she had been less cruel and ambitious.
These were the two greatest defects
that could be imputed to her, which
at last deprived her of her honour, and
her life. <hi>Bactas Aga</hi> of the Janizaries,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51472:50"/>
the <hi>Bostangibachi,</hi> the <hi>Capi Aga,</hi> the
Captain General of the Sea, the <hi>Aga</hi>
of the White Eunuchs, the first <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigi,</hi>
or Captain of the gate of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio,</hi>
and all the other Officers who
were concerned in the Conspiracy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated
their Crimes, by several kinds
of deaths.</p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Grand Visiers</hi> command to
hinder the Criminals from escaping,
was so well executed, that none of
them could avoid the punishment they
had deserved. The Janizaries knew
nothing of what had passed till they
were disabled from doing any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
and were not in a condition to
resist the <hi>Spahies,</hi> who would have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
upon them, and stirred up the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to put them to the Sword for their
Treason to <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and their attempt
on <hi>Sultan Mahomet;</hi> and the <hi>Grand
Signiors</hi> Authority would not have
kept them from coming to blows, if
the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> had not with-held the
<hi>Spahies</hi> by giving them money, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring
them that the <hi>Sultan</hi> was satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the punishment of their lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
After that, he assembled the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51472:51"/>
                        <hi>Divan,</hi> whither all the Grandees of
the Port, and <hi>Constantinople</hi> repaired;
to whom he made a fine speech, which
he ended with thanking them from
the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and the <hi>Great Sultana</hi> who
were present. All the Assembly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
him with a thousand acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Joy; and nothing was heard
all over the City, but, live <hi>Sultan Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi>
and the <hi>Great Sultana Valide</hi> his
Mother. This Title which signifies
Queen, or Empress, was then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
on her, it being never given to
any but the Emperors Mother.</p>

                     <p>AFter that <hi>Mahomet Coprogli</hi> had
thus diverted the dangers
that threatned the <hi>Sultana,</hi> he
made it his business to restore the
peace of the whole Empire, which
had been long disturbed by the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
of the Janizaries: but knowing
their seditious humor, and foreseeing
it would be difficult to make them
continue the War of <hi>Candy,</hi> in which
they could never succeed, if they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
it unwillingly: He resolved to
desist from that a while, and find them
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51472:52"/>
imployment somewhere else, where
they could make no excuse or objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to keep them from fighting. He
took exceptions at the ambitious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of <hi>Ragotski,</hi> Prince of <hi>Transylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
who was fallen out with the King
of <hi>Poland,</hi> in favour of the <hi>Swedes,</hi>
contrary to the orders of the Port,
which allowed not that Prince to make
any War without its approbation.
The <hi>Grand Visier</hi> chose the most facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Officers to send with the Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
into <hi>Transylvania,</hi> as well to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise
<hi>Ragotski's</hi> rashness, as to receive
the punishment due to their own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience;
for he doubted not but
that they would meet with a vigorous
resistance. This War proved ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
bloody, and disadvantagious
to the Janizaries; they almost all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
in it either at the siege of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembourg,</hi>
which they were fain to raise
after they had lost most of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
before it; or at the Conquest of
<hi>Waradin,</hi> and the Combats they had
with Prince <hi>Ragotski;</hi> besides those
whom the Plague swept away in the
Camp, finishing the destruction of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51472:52"/>
those who survived the War: so that
there hardly remained an handful of
them to bring the news of their total
defeat to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The <hi>Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier</hi>
who hoped for no better success,
was satisfied to see his expectation
was not deceived. Their arrogance
was so much abated that he could not
have taken a fuller revenge of them
who had been so bold as to undertake
to dethrone their Emperor. He deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated
a while whether he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish this Militia or no, which is
accounted the best of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
whose strength and support it is
said to be: And this presumption is
the reason of the liberty it so often
takes of being seditious. It was in
this Ministers power to abolish them;
but considering that then the <hi>Spahies</hi>
who take themselves to be the only
Gentlemen among the Turks, would
grow so potent that they would be no
less dangerous to the Emperor and
the State. He concluded it would
be better to maintain two sorts of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia
in the Empire, whose emulation
and jealousie would keep them in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51472:53"/>
Therefore he made a levy of
men fit to bear Arms, out of whom
he chose fifteen thousand of the best
to be Janizaries. These he Discipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for some time, often taking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views
of them, and exercising them
before the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi>
To accustom
them to be obedient, he gave them
Captains that were at his devotion,
who conducted them into <hi>Candia,</hi>
where he resolved to continue the
War, though it was very toilsome,
and expensive. The Generals who
had been sent to the Conquest of this
Island, since the beginning of the
War, made use of the command they
had over the Army, to raise their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
so that they would hardly
submit to the Port. They pretended
at least to be equal to the <hi>Grand Visier,</hi>
whom they no longer looked on as
their Superior. The exigency of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and the troubles that hapned
in the State, had hindred the <hi>Divan</hi>
from repressing their insolence: But
<hi>Mahomet Coprogli</hi> thought it high time
to oppose the growth of an authority
that destroyed his, and prevent the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51472:53"/>
ill consequences which the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Bassa Delle Vssain,</hi> General of the
Army in <hi>Candia,</hi> might have, who
took a great deal of state upon him,
contemned the <hi>Grand Visier,</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no orders from the Port but
such as pleased him, and used threats
when he had not every thing he ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
He craftily got this proud Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to make a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
example of him to posterity,
and to maintain the honour of his
Master, and the authority of his
Charge. <hi>Vssain Bassa</hi> was no sooner
arrived at the Port, whither his own
presumption, fortified by the <hi>Visier
Azems</hi> splendid promises, had unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
brought him: but he was thrown
into the bottom of a prison, with
a great many Christian Officers,
whom he had brought along with
him in triumph, and whom, swelled
with pride and rashness, he still abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the Dungeon, where not long
after he was strangled before them;
which afflicted him more, than death
it self.</p>
                     <p>By this exact Justice, <hi>Mahomet Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>progli</hi>
                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:51472:54"/>
kept the Souldiers, and all the
Officers of the Empire in obedience.
The resolution of this great Minister
was admirable, in this bold action, of
putting to death so famous, and so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
a man, who thought his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
secure, and much more his
Life; having gained an absolute
power over the Souldiers, and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the chief of the Empire to his
side. But the apprehension of the
consequence of this blow, hindred
not the <hi>Visier Azem</hi> from giving it, to
prevent the <hi>Bassa's</hi> intrigues, which
must needs have been prejudicial to
the Emperor, and his Subjects. He
foresaw how much he should expose
himself, but his zeal to serve the
State, and his Master, made him pass
by such considerations, and slight all
dangers. He was not at all concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that his enemies blamed this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
being certain that those who were
of <hi>Vssain Bassa's</hi> party would impute
his death to his jealousie: but he
knew that there is no station at Court
free from censure, and no behaviour
so prudent, as to prevent all accidents,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51472:54"/>
and that the Ministers of Princes are
most exposed to the wounds of envy.
This consideration kept him from
punishing the chief of the Port,
among whom was the <hi>Mufti.</hi> The
<hi>Sultana Valide</hi> was Regent of the
Empire; she knew the fidelity, and
wonderful genius of <hi>Mahomet Coprogli;</hi>
she had an intire confidence in him,
relied on his care, communicated all
things to him, and was not ashamed
to testifie her gratitude to him to
whom she owed her life, and her Son,
his life, and Empire. Those who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
the greatness, and desert of the
<hi>Visier Azem,</hi> found fault with the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana
Valide's</hi> kindness to him; which
when this wise Politician perceived,
that he might prefer the good of the
State before his own interest, he was
so generous as to desire the <hi>Sultana</hi> to
moderate her affection, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
was but the pure effect of her
gratitude. And she did it in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the prudence of this great
man, who established his fortune with
so much modesty, and discretion, that
it was never subject to the least dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51472:55"/>
and he sustained the affaults
of his Enemies with so much constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and steddiness, that they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at last to beg his pardon; which
the generous <hi>Coprogli</hi> easily granted
them, besides many other favours.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Recruits
which he had sent into <hi>Candia,</hi> and
the Troops which <hi>Ali Bassa</hi> had led
into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> gave hopes of great
advantages over the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who
seeing themselves attaqued by two
powerful Armies at once, thought it
their best way to make a League with
some Prince that was able to divert
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Forces. To this purpose
they sent to their Agent whom they
usually maintain in the <hi>Persian</hi> Court,
to treat an Alliance out of hand with
the <hi>Sophy,</hi> to oblige him to take Arms
in behalf of the Republick. The
Resident succeeded in his Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as well as the <hi>Signiory</hi> could
wish. And <hi>Achab Acmes Sophi</hi> newly
newly come to the Throne by the
Death of the King his Father, took
occasion to demand of <hi>Sultan Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
the restitution of <hi>Bagdet,</hi> which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51472:55"/>
has ever been the Domain of the
Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> and in case of denial,
declared War against him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Babylon,</hi> now <hi>Bagdet,</hi> is not only
one of the best flowers of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Crown, but is a place of such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
that the <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperor
could not restore it to the <hi>Persian,</hi>
without opening him the way to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi>
The <hi>Grand Visier</hi> thought
it not convenient to facilitate the
means of so dangerous an Enemies
visiting his Master, when he should
have a mind to it: therefore he sent
back the <hi>Persian</hi> Embassador with a
refusal, which made the <hi>Sophy</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to reduce <hi>Babylon</hi> with a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Army. The Grand Duke of <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy</hi>
had pretensions to the Provinces
that border'd his Dominions: he list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
favourably to the Complaints
and Propositions of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador,
and received his presents,
with the offers which the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
made him of a very consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
sum, in case he would invade the
Turks. He sent an Embassador to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi>
to assure the Senate of his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51472:56"/>
At the same time the <hi>Cham</hi>
or Emperor of the <hi>Tartars</hi> thought of
revenging the death of his Father,
who was murthered by <hi>Sultan Ibrahim.</hi>
The alliance that has always been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Chams,</hi> and the <hi>Sultans,</hi>
makes those Princes be thought to
hold in some sort of the Turkish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
because they receive great sums
of mony to maintain the vast Armies
which they have always on foot, to
furnish the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> with Troops,
when he undertakes any War; which
causes a continual commerce between
them: therefore the <hi>Grand Cham</hi> is
not treated at the Port like other Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
Princes, but is looked on as the
presumptive Heir of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
in case the Race of the <hi>Sultans</hi>
comes to fail for want of Males. And
this was it that caused the <hi>Cham</hi> to
send an Embassador at <hi>Mahomets</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Empire, to desire that he
might be named Tutor to the young
Prince; believing that it belonged to
him before any other, by the right
which the laws of the <hi>Musulmans,</hi> and
the <hi>Turkish</hi> Constitutions give him to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51472:56"/>
the Crown. But the <hi>Divan</hi> having
rejected this Demand, he did not
openly shew his displeasure, waiting
an occasion to make it appear, and to
require satisfaction as well for that,
as for the murther of his Father. This
conjuncture of affairs seeming favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his design, he declared the
cause of his discontent, by denouncing
War against the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and
sending his Forces to spoil his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
This Enemy was very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable;
the <hi>Sophy</hi> was no less for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable;
the <hi>Moscovite</hi> was not to
be slighted; and the <hi>Venetians</hi> on
their side made great preparations:
but beside, there sprung up a domestick
dissension, which was no less dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
The <hi>Spahies</hi> and the Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
who are the two strongest nerves
of the <hi>Grand Signior's</hi> Forces, and are
in continual enmity, by reason of
their jealousie of one another, hapned
to quarrel, and proceeded so far as
to fortifie themselves one against the
other; so that they became intracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and could not be brought to
march to the place where they were
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51472:57"/>
ordered. They kept <hi>Constantinople</hi> in
perpetual fears, no body durst stir
abroad into the streets; nothing was
heard of but Murthers, and Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and apprehensions of Fire; the
desolation was general, and the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio</hi>
was in the greater consternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because it seemed impossible to
provide against so many mischiefs at
once. But as if fate had raised all
these disorders together, on purpose to
set forth the prudence of the <hi>Visier
Azem,</hi> by his prodigious conduct, he
found means to appease the domestick
tumults, and to stop the torrent of so
many Potentates, who seemed to have
united their Forces in order to the
<hi>Sultans</hi> ruine. However, <hi>Mahomet Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>progli</hi>
preserved his constancy in the
midst of their misfortunes; shewing
how advantagious it is both to a
Prince, and his people, to have a
Minister whose steady courage no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions
can shake: He judged it
necessary to resist the greatest danger
first. The <hi>Persian</hi> War seemed the
most important, therefore he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to discontinue that of <hi>Candia,</hi> that
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51472:57"/>
he might not be obliged by so many
diversions, to encounter so many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
at once. It was requisite to
unite the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Forces to repulse
the <hi>Sophy,</hi> who had made a furious ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
into the <hi>Sultans</hi> Dominions:
but though he withdrew some of his
Troops out of <hi>Candia,</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi>
he left enought behind, to let the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
see that he did not abandon his
design. The Garrisons were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to preserve the conquered pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the Works that were begun;
which were furnished with provisions
enough to subsist till he should be in a
condition to supply them with new
Forces to continue his Conquests.
These Troops being formed into the
body of an Army were sent towards
<hi>Transylvania,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Ali
Bassa.</hi> At the same time he caused a
mighty Fleet to be rigged, with
which the <hi>Bassa</hi> of the Sea was to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the <hi>Venetians.</hi> He ordered the
Governors of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi>
and the Provinces bordering on <hi>Persia</hi>
to send all the Provisions they could
to <hi>Bagdet,</hi> and to make speedy Levies
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51472:58"/>
to reinforce the Garrisons, whilst he
prepared a numerous Army to resist
the <hi>Sophy,</hi> who on his side also made
great preparations for the War.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Divan</hi> seeing the <hi>Grand Visier</hi>
had so many Armies to bring into the
Field, proposed to him to put the
Law in execution, by which all the
<hi>Grand Signior's</hi> Subjects, above the age
of seven years, are obliged to take
Arms for the defence of the State:
But <hi>Mahomet Coprogli</hi> would not suffer
it to be published, though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
him of rashly exposing the
<hi>Sultan's</hi> Honour, and Power, and the
liberty of his people, who were inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on all sides, and had not forces
enough to repulse so many Enemies at
once. He answered that it was true,
the summoning of all the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior's</hi>
Subjects might compose vast Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
but that he did not think it fit
to come to those extremities: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that among such multitudes a
thousand disorders would happen
more prejudicial, than their assistance
would be useful; that it was the way
to expose the Emperors, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51472:58"/>
glory: that the Enemies would
believe the Empire was reduced to
the utmost straits, and would make
their advantage of it; and lastly
that the people whom they advised
him to arm, not being disciplined,
would make a tumultuous Army, and
would confound the other Troops:
and that he hoped the <hi>Sultan</hi> might
face his Enemies, and finish the War
without this last refuge.</p>
                     <p>But as if Fortune had a mind to
punish his presumption, and put his
courage and constancy to the highest
proofs, she raised him up a new enemy
whom he never dreamt of. This
<hi>Orcan Ogli Bassa</hi> of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> who having
made use of the <hi>Grand Visier's</hi> orders
to raise an Army of forty thousand
men, caused them to march towards
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> without declaring his
design. <hi>Mahomet Coprogli</hi> was adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
of his march at that time, when
he was busied in raising of men to
provide against the most pressing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities.
He was much surprized
when he understood that he had taken
the Field without his order, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51472:59"/>
at first, that he was revolted:
but he soon found that this <hi>Bassa</hi> who
had succeeded him in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and was Nephew to
<hi>Delli Vssain Pacha,</hi> whom he had put
to death some time before, was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to make use of this conjunction of
time to revenge his Unkle, and some
private grudges of his own. He had
drawn to his side several Captains,
and abundance of Souldierr, who had
served under this famous <hi>Bassa Dalli
Vssain Pacha,</hi> whose memory was dear
to them; and to make his revenge
the more remarkable, and give the
enterprize more weight, he pretended
to establish one <hi>Soliman Amurath</hi> on the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Throne, who said he was the
Son of the Emperour <hi>Amurat,</hi> and
joyned himself to him with an Army
of twenty thousand <hi>Arabians, Drus,</hi>
and <hi>Armenians. Orcan Ogli</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
him, and made his Army own
him to be the lawful Successor to the
Empire. This news was quickly
spread over all the Provinces, and
met with so much credit, that several
<hi>Bassa's</hi> came to pay homage to the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51472:59"/>
new Prince, who already behaved
himself as Emperor. The Provinces
of <hi>Asia</hi> made no difficulty of submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to him. His Authority increased
daily, and the little opposition he
found to his new greatness, made the
<hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Aleppo</hi> so confident of success,
that he counselled him to reject the
<hi>Sophi's</hi> Propositions, who offered to
assist him to conquer the whole Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish
Empire. This Prince swelled
with his prosperity, and governing
himself by <hi>Orcan Ogli's</hi> advice, whom
he made his Lieutenant General,
slighted these advantagious offers,
believing he should have no need of
Succors that would cost him so dear,
to gain a Crown, which he hoped to
wear without sharing it with so pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
and dangerous a Prince as the
King of <hi>Persia.</hi> Therefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
his march streight to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
where the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of his Army intended to place
him on the Throne; not questioning
but the Capital City of the Empire
would open its Gates, in obedience
to their Emperor <hi>Soliman Amurat,</hi> as
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51472:60"/>
many others had done already.</p>
                     <p>The noise of approach put all the
world into a strange consternation.
The <hi>Divan</hi> knew not what counsel to
give the <hi>Grand Visier,</hi> but the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Affairs made him find expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients
in the greatest necessities. He
preserved his judgment as well now
as before, and studying how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
what was most to be feared, sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
on those <hi>Bassa's</hi> and Officers whom
he knew to be ill affected, and might
forment the Rebellion: and to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
all murmurs, immediately pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
these Incendiaries. Then he
furnished the City with all sorts of
Ammunition, and commanded his
Son <hi>Achmet Coprogli</hi> at the head of
threescore thousand men, with which
he had design'd to oppose the <hi>Sophy,</hi>
to march under the conduct of <hi>Musta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha
Bassa,</hi> a man of integrity and great
experience, against <hi>Soliman Amurath,</hi>
and the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and give them
Battle as soon as he could. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of some insurrection, kept
him from commanding this Army
himself, believing it necessary for
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51472:60"/>
him to remain at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to have
an eye to all: he had much ado to
contain the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who burned with
impatience to be in the Field, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
to stay in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> while
his Favourite <hi>Achmet,</hi> who was almost
of the same age, exercised his Valour
against his Enemies, whom he would
have chastised himself: but the <hi>Grand
Visier</hi> told him, with the authority of
a Governour, that his Highness
ought not to remove from <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
lest the Mutineers should raise
some Sedition in his absence, which
would be of worse consequence than
all the other mischiefs that threatned
his fortune. That he should not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
his person against an Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
and a revolted Subject; that he
could acquire no glory by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat,
and that it became his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
rather to punish them, than to
expose himself to the danger of a
War, which his Captains might ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate,
while he sate on his Throne,
to take care of the Affairs of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and answer the Embassadors of
Princes, that arrived every day at
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51472:61"/>
the Port. The <hi>Sultan</hi> yielded at
last to the Remonstrances of this
great Minister, and suffered <hi>Achmet
Coprogli</hi> to go, who made all the haste
he could to meet the Enemies; but he
soon learnt that they having notice
of his March, discontinued theirs to
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> and made show to take
some other way. He immediately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertised
the <hi>Grand Visier,</hi> his Father of
it, who at the same time was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that
the <hi>Sophy</hi> advanced towards <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det</hi>
with thirty thousand Horse, and
fifty thousand Foot. <hi>Mahomet Copro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli</hi>
found that the Enemies design was
to stay till the <hi>Sophy</hi> was come into
the <hi>Grand Signior's</hi> Dominions to make
a diversion, which might facilitate
their enterprize, and that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
made them decline meeting
his Son <hi>Achmet:</hi> therefore this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
judging truly of events, hastned
the march of the Army, which he
sent against the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning
that it would come time
enough after his defeat to the relief
of <hi>Bagdet,</hi> and the success answered
his expectation. <hi>Mustapha</hi> and his
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51472:61"/>
Son <hi>Achmet</hi> no sooner received his
orders, but they followed the enemy
with such expedition, that they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
them when they least looked for
them; and gave them no time at all to
look about them, and put themselves
in order to fight. <hi>Achmet</hi> would not
suffer his Troops to lose any of their
zeal by resting after their tiresome
march. He represented to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains
and Souldiers, that they ought
to make use of the enemies disorder,
and without any longer delay he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them so smartly, that he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remained master of the Field, the
Artillery, and the Baggage; but he
took abundance of Prisoners, and so
routed the Army, that the <hi>Bassa</hi> of
<hi>Aleppo</hi> despairing of saving himself by
flight, perswaded <hi>Soliman Amurath</hi> to
render himself to the Conqueror, in
hopes of better usage than if they
should be taken flying.</p>
                     <p>At first he rejected this proposition,
but fearing some treachery from <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan
Ogli,</hi> whom he began to mistrust,
and seeing his Army cut in pieces, he
suffered himself to be carried to <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:51472:62"/>
who presently sent him, and the
<hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The
rest of the rebellious Troops yielded
at discretion, and he pardoned them
on condition they would serve the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> faithfully for the future,
and having joyned them to his own
Army, he marched according to the
<hi>Grand Visiers</hi> order to the relief of <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The news of <hi>Achmet Coprogli's</hi> victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was as satisfactory to his father
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> as the arrival of <hi>Soliman,</hi> and
<hi>Orcan Ogli</hi> was welcome to the <hi>Sultan,</hi>
and the <hi>Sultana</hi> his Mother. The <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
Azem</hi> was infinitely pleased to
have so hopeful a Son; and nothing
diminished the <hi>Grand Signior's</hi> Joy, to
see himself delivered from a competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
who had shaken all his Empire,
but his melancholy for not having
vanquished him himself: But as if
Fortune were weary of persecuting
<hi>Coprogli,</hi> and intended to bless him by
an happy return, she furnished him
with fresh subjects of rejoycing, by
the pleasing news of the <hi>Sophy's</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.
This Prince being informed
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51472:62"/>
that <hi>Achmet Coprogli</hi> was coming to
meet him with a victorious Army,
and that the <hi>Mogul</hi> or Emperor of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
at the <hi>Grand Signior's</hi> desire, was
ready to enter into his Kingdom, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
the way he came, to defend
himself from the <hi>Mogol;</hi> which made
<hi>Achmet</hi> bring back his Army, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it where his Father thought fit:
but he would not return to <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
till he had chastised all the <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>'s,
and Governours, who favoured
the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Aleppo's</hi> Revolt, and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman
Amurath's</hi> enterprise. The <hi>Grand
Visier</hi> caused them both to be behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
without regard to their Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances
that his Son had promised to
save their lives; and that they had
not yielded but on that assurance.
Policy would not give way to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of this promise; and <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
in Amurath,</hi> seeing he had no hope of
safety, reproached <hi>Orcan Ogli</hi> with his
baseness, in forcing him to yield, when
he might have died gloriously with
his arms in his hand, and have preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the ignominy of dying by an Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="116" facs="tcp:51472:63"/>
The death of this Prince is no less
worthy of compassion, than his story
is odd, and deserves to be known. He
was the Son of <hi>Sultan Amurath</hi> the
Fourth, and that <hi>Rachima,</hi> of whom
we spake in his reign. Though this
<hi>Sultana</hi> had abundance of wit, yet she
was very superstitious; so that she
believed the predictions of an <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sairis</hi>
(so are the followers of <hi>Hali</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
whom the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi>
own as a great Prophet; fancying
that all his race have the gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie.)
<hi>Rachima</hi> consulted this man
upon all occasions, as soon as she
found her self with child, she would
needs know the success of her lying
in. The <hi>Almasairis</hi> after some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
answered, That she should
bring forth a Prince, who would be
one day Emperor of the Turks, if he
could avoid the cruelty of his nearest
kindred: and that if Heaven did free
him from a misfortune that was to
happen to him in the capital City of
the Empire, which he was to avoid
dwelling in, he would surpass the
greatness of all the <hi>Ottomans</hi> his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51472:63"/>
                        <hi>Rachima</hi> received this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
as an Oracle; she desired <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath,</hi>
who prepared to return to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
notwithstanding a Prediction
of the <hi>Almasairis</hi> which forbad it, to
leave her at <hi>Damas.</hi> 
                        <q>Sir, said she, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at his feet, if I deserve any
grace of your Highness, shew that
your faithful Slave is not displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to you at this time, by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her one favour. You know, Sir,
that I never importuned you; it is
true, your magnificence has loaded
me with all sorts of benefits; but
the favour I now implore will be
more welcome to me than any I
have already received, because your
Highness is concerned in it: it is to
suffer me to stay here till you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn:
I know no greater unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
than such a separation; it
would kill me with sorrow, Sir; but
I had rather lose my life than ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you to the misfortunes that
threaten you, if I follow you to the
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> where my presence would
cause too much disorder.</q> 
                        <hi>Sultan
Amurath</hi> was at first more surprized at
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51472:64"/>
this request, which he expected not,
than unwilling to grant it; whether
he apprehended the effect of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masairis's</hi>
Prophesie, or that his passion
for <hi>Rachima</hi> was abated, or that he
would not expose her to the resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and jealousie of the <hi>Sultana
Roxana,</hi> whose love was increased
more than ever by his absence. He
bestowed rich Presents on <hi>Rachima,</hi>
commanding the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Damas</hi> to
have a care of her, and to pay her a
very considerable Pension. He as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
her besides, the Tribute which
the King of <hi>Arabia</hi> paid him, and took
leave of her with great marks of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
A little while after <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath's</hi>
departure, <hi>Rachima</hi> was brought
to bed of a Son, whom she named
<hi>Soliman Amurath.</hi> She observed the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of the Prediction, and
brought him up secretly, lest <hi>Roxana</hi>
being informed of his birth, should
order him to be put to death. She
knew that this great <hi>Sultana</hi> was no
less dangerous than powerful, and
that only her distance from her freed
her from her cruelty. The news of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51472:64"/>
her death was the more welcome to
her, because she hoped to have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
her place. And she was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
to let the <hi>Sultan</hi> know the birth
of his Son, when <hi>Amurath's</hi> death
spoiled her design: and she thought it
not fit to discover the young Prince
<hi>Soliman Amurath,</hi> not having power
enough to place him on the Throne:
On the contrary, she was careful to
keep him from being known to <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him,</hi>
who succeeded <hi>Amurath,</hi> lest he
who came not to the Empire, but for
want of an heir, and was thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of leaving any, should follow
the cruel policy of his Ancestors by
sacrificing Prince <hi>Soliman,</hi> who alone
would dispute the Crown with him.
<hi>Rachima</hi> therefore stood upon her
guard, and contented her self with
the Revenue that <hi>Sultan Amurath</hi> left
her. But <hi>Sinan Bassa,</hi> Governour of
<hi>Damas,</hi> who always had honoured her
in the life of the deceased <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi>
and paid her Pension exactly,
discontinued his respect to her in the
new Emperors time, and threatned to
send her to the old <hi>Seraglio</hi> at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi>

The <hi>Sultana</hi> mistrusting the
<hi>Bassa,</hi> resolved to retire into <hi>Persia,</hi>
where she was born, or to some Prince,
whose Authority might protect her,
and her Son, from her enemies. To
colour her retreat, she gave out that
she had made a Vow to visit the
Tomb of the great Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
and having begun her journey under
this pretence, she went to <hi>Reba</hi> King
of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> the same who was
to pay his tribute to her. This Prince
not being so barbarous, as usually
those of his Nation are, received <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chima</hi>
with a great deal of kindness.
This young <hi>Sultana,</hi> who was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
two and twenty years old, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
so handsome to him, that he
not only promised her his protection,
but also offered her his Crown, and
his Heart. <hi>Rachima</hi> was no less plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with King <hi>Rabas</hi> person, than his
generosity: He had so many good
qualities, that he easily made himself
be beloved. The <hi>Sultana</hi> sought a
Protector, and thought it not fit to
neglect the <hi>Arabian</hi> King. They
found they had inclination enough to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51472:65"/>
one another; she received so many
marks of sincere good will from him,
that she made no great difficulty to
bestow her heart on him. He took a
particular care of the young Prince
<hi>Soliman Amurath,</hi> being glad of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
such a Subject as might revenge
the persecution he had suffered from
the Port in the Reign of <hi>Amurath,</hi>
who reduced him to pay Tribute;
from which he would have freed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by joyning with <hi>Emir Ficardin</hi>
Prince of <hi>Dus</hi> his Kinsman, whom
<hi>Bassa Giaphar</hi> overcame, and sent to
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he was ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously
put to death. King <hi>Reba</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
his resentment, only waiting
an occasion to shew it, and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
suffered the obedience and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
which he was bound to render
to the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> To shake off
this yoke, he armed Prince <hi>Soliman,</hi>
whhm he educated as his own Son,
and negotiated secretly with the <hi>Bassa</hi>
of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and some other Governors
of Provinces in <hi>Asia,</hi> who revolted
from <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> when his Empire
was invaded on all sides, with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51472:66"/>
to drive him from the Throne,
and place Prince <hi>Soliman Amurath</hi> on
it in his stead. We have seen how
their enterprize succeeded, and the
King of <hi>Arabia</hi> was slain with his
arms in his hand, performing the
part of a brave Souldier, and a great
Captain, in the Battle that <hi>Soliman</hi>
lost.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rachima,</hi> who followed him in this
War, died a little while after of grief,
that she had destroyed her Son, by
endeavouring to bring him to the
Throne, according to the Prediction
of the <hi>Almasairis.</hi> This Prince had
something extraordinary in his air,
and Person. The Turks affirmed
that he perfectly resembled <hi>Sultan
Amurath</hi> his Father, who was the
handsomest man in his Empire.</p>
                     <p>After the death of <hi>Soliman Amurath,
Orcan Ogli,</hi> and the <hi>Bassa's,</hi> and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
who followed his Fortune,
the retreat of the <hi>Persian Sophy</hi> left
<hi>Asia</hi> in a peaceable condition; which
made the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> apply himself
to oppose the other Wars that mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire. He ordered
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51472:66"/>
all his Troops to be in the Field by
<hi>March,</hi> in the mean time he continued
his negotiations with the Great Duke
of <hi>Moscovy,</hi> to divert him from inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> in favour of
the <hi>Venetians.</hi> He expected the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of his Deputies at the Port, who
were to explain the Dukes intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and not finding it so easie to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
the Emperor of the <hi>Tartars,</hi>
whom he dreaded more than all the
rest of the <hi>Sultans</hi> enemies, he secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
engaged the <hi>Cham</hi> of the petty <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>
to joyn himself with the chief of
the <hi>Great Chams</hi> Subjects, who were
revolted: so that when this Prince
prepared vast Forces to invade the
<hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Provinces, he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to make use of his preparations
to defend his own Estate; and was
glad to send an Embassador to the
<hi>Sultan,</hi> to make him reparation, and
offer him all his Forces, when he had
appeased the Troubles which the pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Cham,</hi> and his own Grandees had
raised. This Embassy secured the <hi>Grand
Visier,</hi> and freed him from a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
enemy. However he left not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51472:67"/>
off his warlike preparations, both by
Sea and Land, and continually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to render his Master the
most formidable, and powerful Prince
in the world.</p>
                     <p>While he waited for a proper sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to make some expedition, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
a <hi>Chiaux</hi> to the Emperor, to
demand passage through his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the <hi>Sultan's</hi> Army into <hi>Friuli.</hi>
The <hi>Chiaux</hi> was sent back with a
refusal dishonourable to the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior;</hi>
but the <hi>Visier Azem</hi> thought it
not time to shew his resentment, or
to send any Troops into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> till
the <hi>Sophy</hi> were quite determined ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Peace or War. He feared lest
he should agree with the <hi>Mogol,</hi> seeing
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Arms imployed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
place, and defer the sending his
Embassadors to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
the Peace which he had broken.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> in the mean time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
informed that the Troubles of the
Port were accommodated; and that
Embassadors were arrived there from
those Princes of <hi>Asia,</hi> who had given
them hopes of diverting the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
                        <pb n="125" facs="tcp:51472:67"/>
Forces, were afraid of having them
all turned upon them in a short time;
and though they had obtained great
advantages over <hi>Sultan Mahomet's</hi>
Fleet, they resolved to send, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
peace of him. But this Prince
being swayed by his first Minister, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
their Agents very coldly, and
told them that the <hi>Signiory</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi>
had no other way to end the War, but
to yield the Kingdom of <hi>Candia</hi> to
him, and the Town of <hi>Clissa,</hi> the most
considerable place in <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> and
to pay him three Millions of Gold for
the charges he had been at since the
beginning of the War.</p>
                     <p>These conditions were too hard to
be accepted, and the War it self
could not be more disadvantagious to
the <hi>Venetians;</hi> and it was the <hi>Visier
Azem's</hi> design to continue it: he had
private reasons not to make Peace
with the enemies of the Empire. He
knew by experience that after such
considerable preparations, it was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to dismiss the Souldiers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
abating their heat, and impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
by the toils of War. He had
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51472:68"/>
a mind to imploy the Janizaries, to
avoid the Seditions they commonly
raise in Peace: So that the <hi>Venetians</hi>
seeing themselves rejected, implored
the assistance of all the Princes of
Christendom. The <hi>Grand Visier</hi> who
foresaw they would have this refuge,
prepared to resist all their attempts,
and obstinately pursued the getting of
<hi>Candia,</hi> accounting it the most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and beneficial conquest the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
could ever make. He sent great
refreshments to the Troops that were
there, and all provisions necessary to
continue the Siege of the chief City
of the Island. Now the <hi>Sultan</hi> was
more desirous than ever of command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his own Army, threatning if they
continued to with-hold him, that he
would steal away privately to go to
the Camp, and discover himself to
his Souldiers. <hi>Mahomet Coprogli</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
all his art to moderate his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
without incurring his hatred;
making use of all his prudence on so
nice an occasion. The <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
honoured him as his Father, and had
intire confidence in his conduct; but
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51472:68"/>
he listned to the flatteries and partial
perswasions of a great many young
men, and <hi>Bassa's,</hi> who would have
drawn him out of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> that
they might with more ease insinuate
into his favour, and diminish the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the <hi>Grand Visier.</hi> This Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
foreseeing the consequences,
desired the <hi>Sultana Valide</hi> to joyn her
endeavours with his, to convince the
Emperor, that he ought by no means
to expose himself to those disgraces
that might be followed by the loss of
his Estate, and life too. The <hi>Sultan</hi>
would not disoblige the <hi>Sultana</hi> his
Mother, or the <hi>Visier Azem;</hi> he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him to send an Army into <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia,</hi>
under the conduct of <hi>Mahomet
Coprogli,</hi> who had order to besiege
<hi>Clissa,</hi> and <hi>Zara;</hi> but his Valor was
not seconded by his Souldiers, and
with all his attempts, he could not
carry these two places. This young
Captain shewed a fierceness that asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the most resolute; he desired
nothing but a Battle to end that War.
Those who wondered at this vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence,
knew not that the desire of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51472:69"/>
glory was not the only passion that
animated his courage: but it is not
yet time to discover the cause, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
the relation of <hi>Mahomet Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>progli's</hi>
Ministry, to treat of his Sons
loves, which we will speak of at length
in the sequel of this History.</p>
                     <p>While brave <hi>Achmet</hi> pressed the
Siege of the Capital City of <hi>Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>
and the Army in <hi>Candia</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to conquer that Island in
spight of all the <hi>Venetians</hi> resistance;
the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> who applied himself
to the particular Affairs of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and to provide for the subsistance
of the Armies, found himself at the
same time obliged to extinguish a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
War, which began to break out
by the factiousness of some disconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
persons. The frequency of these
kind of disgraces had so confirmed
<hi>Mahomet's</hi> soul, and courage, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
surprised him: nevertheless he
stopt not this flame without difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and bloodshed. It cost young <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi>
the Author of the Revolt, his life,
who was the Son of <hi>Vssain,</hi> Captain
General of the Sea, whom the <hi>Grand
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51472:69"/>
Visier</hi> caused to be beheaded for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<hi>Soliman Amurath,</hi> and the <hi>Bey</hi>
of <hi>Togor</hi> suffered the same punishment,
for having committed some fault
contrary to his duty.</p>
                     <p>These troubles were no sooner
quieted, but the death of <hi>Ragotski</hi>
Prince of <hi>Transylvania,</hi> gave the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
Azem</hi> an opportunity of extending
the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Dominions. This
Province had been the seat of a long
War, which was ended by the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of the deceased Prince, who
paid great sums to the Port. The
<hi>Grand Visier</hi> pretended this was a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
and that this Province hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Turkish Empire, the right
of nominating a Prince belonged to
the <hi>Sultan.</hi> The States of <hi>Transyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi>
not giving way to this pretence,
were assembled after <hi>Ragotski's</hi> death,
to elect another Prince. <hi>Chimin Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos,</hi>
and <hi>Count Barelay,</hi> were Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors
at this Election. The first,
who was the most considerable, put
himself into the Emperors protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
promising never to have any
thing to do with the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi>
                        <pb n="130" facs="tcp:51472:70"/>
The other on the contrary, relied on
the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and promised to own him
for his Sovereign. These two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders
divided the Estate by their
Factions. <hi>Count Barelays</hi> submission
was accepted of at the Port, and in
his behalf the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> ordered
<hi>Ali Bassa</hi> to enter <hi>Transylvania</hi> with fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thousand men, who presently took
a strong place called <hi>Waradin,</hi> which
refused to acknowledge <hi>Count Barelay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperor on the other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ide sent
an Army to defend <hi>Chimin Ianos,</hi> and
to keep the Turks from breaking into
his Territories. <hi>Ali Bassa</hi> was no
sooner informed of this, but he sent
to <hi>Count Souches</hi> the General of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Troops, to pay the <hi>Sultan</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
for the places which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
possessed on the Frontiers of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary;</hi>
and in case of refusal, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
War, and threatned his Highnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
own coming with an Army of
an hundred thousand men. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
having received this news, put
twelve thousand men under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of <hi>Count Montecuculi,</hi> to guard the
Frontiers, and sent to demand aid of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51472:70"/>
all the Princes of the Empire, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> would break the
Peace. But the arrival of a <hi>Chiaux</hi>
whom the <hi>Sultan</hi> dispatched to him by
the advice of the <hi>Visier Azem,</hi> who
was not yet fully prepared to make
War on the Emperor, secured him a
little. The <hi>Sultan</hi> sent him word that
he desired to maintain the Peace with
him, and that he disapproved the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of <hi>Ali Bassa,</hi> whom he had
only ordered to support the Prince of
<hi>Transylvania,</hi> who put himself under
his protection. But the Emperor find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that without any regard to the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances
of this Envoy, the General
of the Turkish Army continued his
Conquest in <hi>Transylvania,</hi> he stood on
his guard, and recalling <hi>Count Souches</hi>
to face the Enemy, and enter into the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Dominions, he sent <hi>Count Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi>
to command his Troops: So that
these two parties provok'd one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
by little and little, without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to an open War. The <hi>Grand Visier</hi>
was unwilling to declare, yet he
would not lose the opportunity of
wholly reducing <hi>Transylvania,</hi> or at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:51472:71"/>
least of making its Prince hold direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he solicited <hi>Chimin Ianos</hi> (whom
the Estates owned as their lawful
Prince, and who in spight of the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi>
Army had possessed himself of
the best places) to submit himself to
the Port, giving him hopes of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
protection: but the Prince
rejected his propositions, which so
provoked him, who had set his heart
upon joyning this Province to the
<hi>Sultans</hi> Dominions, that he could no
longer contain his displeasure against
the Emperor; resolving to have sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
from him, for hindering his
projects: and to revenge himself more
speedily, and obtain that by force
which he could not get fairly, he put
the <hi>Cham</hi> of the <hi>Tartars</hi> in mind of
his promises to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and
received thirty thousand men from
him with which he augmented <hi>Ali
Bassa's</hi> Army. This General being
thus re-inforced, divided his Troops,
to make several attaques at once, at
the same time besieging <hi>Zeiklit, Callo,</hi>
and <hi>Zatmar,</hi> three places that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51472:71"/>
to the Emperor: but he found so
much resistance, that with all his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
he could take none of them but
<hi>Callo,</hi> and was forced to raise the other
Sieges, and retire, to avoid fighting
with the Imperial General, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him Battel.</p>
                     <p>This War hindred not the <hi>Grand
Visier</hi> from pressing that of <hi>Candia,</hi> and
sending continual refreshments to the
Army, which held <hi>Canea</hi> against the
<hi>Venetians;</hi> and after he had put all
the Affairs of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire to
a good posture, he designed to go in
person to carry on the <hi>Transylvanian</hi>
War, not being satisfied with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Ali.</hi> He mistrusted the great
power which this <hi>Bassa</hi> had gained
among the Souldiers, and feared he
would be very troublesome to him, on
the least discontent; he could not
take away his command, or revoke
him, without a specious pretence, for
fear of reducing him to make use of his
present reputation to maintain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his charge. This considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made him resolve to command the
Army himself, finding no better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51472:72"/>
to take away all suspicion
from <hi>Ali Bassa,</hi> who would be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to give place to him without
complaining, because the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
always look upon the <hi>Grand Visier,</hi>
when he is in the Camp, as their only
General. He had a mind besides to
establish his Son among the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
who already knew how to gain
their kindness: and he flattered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with the hopes that he should one
day be able to repose part of his cares
on him. He knew his valour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and believed him capable of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
up that place in the Army which
was not fit for himself, and which he
could not securely trust another with:
but death prevented this great mans
design. He was no sooner gone from
<hi>Constantinople</hi> with the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi>
who removed from thence because of
the Plague, but he found himself at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqued
by a violent Feaver, which
forced him to stay at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he sent for his Son; to give him
his last instructions; foreseeing that
he should not recover. At this time
he imparted to <hi>Achmet Coprogli,</hi> all
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51472:72"/>
the politick maximes which his long
experience, and penetrating wit had
taught him. He charged him never
to do any injustice; to sacrifice his
own interests, and particular inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the good of the State; to be
always faithful to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and to
advise him to undertake no new War
till those of <hi>Candia</hi> and <hi>Transylvania</hi>
were ended: <q>Remember my Son,
said he, to observe the Laws, and
that to serve your Prince is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
the greatest part of the
Law.</q> After these Remonstrances,
he called <hi>Fatima</hi> his Wife, who was
infinitely afflicted to see this great
man die without leaving any authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to his Son: but <hi>Mahomet Coprogli</hi>
having somewhat recovered his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
resolved to do something before
he died, worthy of his subtilty, and
prudence. He contrived with <hi>Fatima,</hi>
and his Son, all that was necessary to
make his last designs succeed; and he
writ a Letter to the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> in
which he told him, that finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
at the point to die, nothing trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
him more than that he died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51472:73"/>
he had finished the Wars which
his Highness had with two powerful
Enemies: but he hoped that he would
happily put an end to them if he made
use of the counsel which he had given
his Son <hi>Achmet,</hi> to whom he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
the Seal of the Empire, to
give it to his Highness, if he judged
him unworthy to keep it: yet if the
<hi>Sultan</hi> had any respect to his passed ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
or gave any credit to the last
words of the faithfullest of his Slaves,
he protested to him that he could not
choose a man worthier to be <hi>Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier</hi>
than <hi>Achmet Coprogli,</hi> of whose abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
he was assured, and whom he had
furnished with all instructions necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to acquit himself perfectly of that
great charge. He added that he
knew well enough this choice was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual;
but that the <hi>Sultans</hi> interest
ought to make him neglect a piece of
Policy that was not so useful to him
as it had been to his Ancestors; and
that besides his Highness should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that Empires would perish, if
the Laws were not often subjected to
necessity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:51472:73"/>
When he had written this Letter
with a great deal of pain, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Fatima</hi> to send it to the <hi>Grand
Signior,</hi> by the <hi>Visiers,</hi> who would come
to receive his last words: but he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
her not to give them the Seal, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<hi>Achmet</hi> to keep it, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
it to none but the Emperor. At
last, finding himself grow very weak,
he left off speaking, for fear of being
surprized by the Deputies of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van.</hi>
When he saw them, he made
as if he had lost his speech; and to let
them see that he understood what
they said, he pointed to his Son, who
was by his bed-side. The <hi>Visiers,</hi> that
they might know his meaning, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on <hi>Fatima,</hi> as if they would learn
it of her. This cunning Woman
bursting out into tears, told them that
his meaning was that the <hi>Sultan</hi> might
know by <hi>Achmet,</hi> what he would
have learned of him; that he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
him with the secrets of the
Empire, by giving him the Seal, and
discovering to him some particulars,
very important to the State, of which
she was ignorant: but perhaps that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51472:74"/>
Letter which she gave them might
clear all; that they should carry it to
the Emperor, and inform him in what
condition they left the <hi>Grand Visier.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>She spake these words so naturally,
that the Deputies suspected nothing,
they were indeed concerned, that
they did not carry the Seal of the
Empire back with them; but they
never imagined that the <hi>Visier Azems</hi>
Son should keep it. They were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gone from him, when he expired,
and his death was no less deplored
than it was particular to a man of his
condition: for it is not usual for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire to die a
natural death. Almost all his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
either through the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors</hi>
jealousie, or for their evil admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration,
or their injustices, died by
the hands of Executioners. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
services <hi>Mahomet
Coprogli</hi> had done the
State,<note place="margin">March 7. 1663.</note> and his great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
deserved a better
end, which happened in the seven and
fiftieth year of his age.</p>
                     <p>Those who envied the glory of this
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51472:74"/>
great man, did all they could to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
it. They reproached him with
too much gravity, which they ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to his pride; but it was rather
the effect of his temper: it is true,
he knew the advantage he had over
others by his experience, and was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
careful to preserve it; often hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
those very roughly, who contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
his opinion, which he never
ventured to declare, but when he was
well assured of the consequence. The
<hi>Divan,</hi> which he always governed,
taxed him of referring nothing to
them, and invading the Sovereign
Authority. The success of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
manifested that he had reason
to act so, and that he had no need of
any bodies assistance: but how unjust
soever his enemies are, they cannot
affirm, that since the beginning of
the Turkish Monarchy, there were
ever so many troubles, as during the
administration of this <hi>Grand Visier.</hi>
Never was any Prince more disturbed
in his <hi>minority</hi> than <hi>Sultan Mahomet,</hi> or
more vigorously defended: and when
he was ready to sink under the weight
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51472:75"/>
of so many Civil and Forein Wars,
in his most tender age, he made three
parts of the world tremble. He has
increased his Empire by the conquest
of a part of <hi>Transylvania,</hi> and by the
wonderful prudence of this great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
constrained the mightiest Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates
to sue for Peace.</p>
                     <p>His readiness to punish those who
were seditious was accounted cruelty;
yet he never exercised this rigour,
but to prevent combinations, which
are ever fatal, and destructive to the
people. He knew that the first strokes
of Justice and Revenge are the best,
and that the way to quiet a Sedition,
was to strike at the authors of it. He
had several other Maxims; and when
he was forced to raise money to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray
the charges of the War, he was
wont to say, that Peace was not to
be obtained without Arms, or War
carried on without money. So he
exacted Tribute, without rendring his
Administration odious to the people,
who yet honour his memory in the
person of <hi>Achmet Coprogli,</hi> the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
of so worthy a Father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:51472:75"/>
The <hi>Visiers,</hi> whom the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi>
and the <hi>Sultana Valide</hi> had deputed
to receive the Seal of the Empire,
and the <hi>Visier Azem's</hi> last words, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
discharged their Commission,
brought the first news of his death,
which was extremely lamented by the
<hi>Sultan,</hi> and the <hi>Sultana</hi> his Mother:
but when they had learned the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
that <hi>Fatima</hi> informed them of
by the Letter, which she delivered to
the <hi>Visiers,</hi> they suspended their sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
to consult how they should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the choice of another Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
<hi>Achmet Coprogli's</hi> youth, who was
not yet thirty years old, out-weighed
his desert, and seemed an invincible
obstacle to the <hi>Grand Signior's</hi> design,
of complying with the <hi>Sultana Valide,</hi>
who had a mind to confirm the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<hi>Visier Azem's</hi> choice of his Son to
succeed him: and she alledged such
strong reasons, that the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who
referred all things to her, at last gave
his consent. The <hi>Visiers</hi> represented
to him, that to give the first Charge
of the Empire to his Son who had
possessed it before, was a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51472:76"/>
to the Laws, and Maxims of
State; that the <hi>Divan,</hi> the Militia,
and the People, would repine to see a
young man raised to a Dignity that
was fit for none but a <hi>Bassa</hi> of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
desert, and consummate expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
However he was swayed by
the <hi>Sultana</hi> his Mother, who on the
other side, represented to him, that
he could not sufficiently reward <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>'s
services, but by putting <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
into his place. This was not the
only consideration that made the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi>
favourable to him; she held her
self obliged to endeavour the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a man who had married a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that was so nearly related to her.
This is a story that deserves to be
treated of at length; therefore I will
return to those things which I before
only touched at, the better to clear
those adventures that have hitherto
been obscure: the most secret particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of which are come to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>

                     <p>WHen <hi>Fatima</hi> had received
the Princess <hi>Iohaime,</hi> the
Daughter of the <hi>Sultana
Zaime,</hi> she brought her up as her own
child in the house of <hi>Mahomet Coprogli</hi>
her Husband, who was then Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Aleppo.</hi> Her Son <hi>Achmet</hi> was
yet so young, that he easily believed
<hi>Iohaime</hi> was his Sister: he accustomed
himself to love her; and as much a
child as he was, conceived a stronger
friendship for her than usually that
tender age is capable of. This kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51472:77"/>
ness increased with the beauty of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haime,</hi>
who grew every day more and
more amiable. <hi>Achmet</hi> always droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when he saw her not, and <hi>Iohaime</hi>
was equally affected with his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:
their mutual inclination grew
with them, and never was there a
stronger sympathy of two hearts;
they were bred up together with a
Politene, which is not common among
the Turks. <hi>Mahomet Coprogli,</hi> and
<hi>Fatima</hi> omitted nothing that might
give them an education conformable
to their quality. They knew the
union of these two persons, and their
tenderness for one another; but they
did not at all mistrust their virtue, or
imagine that they could have other
thoughts than such as were inspired
by their seeming nearness of blood:
therefore they suffered them to live at
liberty, taking care to maintain their
mistake, in which they continued
them, till <hi>Achmet</hi> whose age made
him more discerning, discovered it
by remarking the difference which
his Parents put between <hi>Iohaime</hi> and
his other Sister; that they refused
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51472:77"/>
several advantagious matches that
were offered her; and often had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
discourses together in which she
was concerned. This made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
there was some mystery in it,
and desiring his Mother to unfold the
whole secret to him, which his own
curiosity had already half discovered.
<hi>Fatima</hi> who loved her Son extremely,
and was assured of his discretion, told
him that <hi>Iohaime</hi> who passed for hers,
was the Daughter of a <hi>Sultana,</hi> but
that it was as much as her life was
worth to reveal it. Now <hi>Achmets</hi> eyes
were opened, he found that all that
he had felt for this Princess, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a violent passion; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
his heart more nearly, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that he had so long mistaken
himself to be her Brother, whom he
had always beheld with a Lovers
eyes. The possibility of having her
one day in his possession, redoubled
his joy, which he moderated as well
as he could, lest <hi>Iohaime</hi> should find
out the cause of it, being unwilling
to lose the title of her Brother, till he
could assume that of her Husband, of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51472:78"/>
which he did not despair; knowing
that the Daughters of the <hi>Sultana's</hi>
are frequently married to the <hi>Bassa's,</hi>
and Grandees of the Port. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
his Father was in augmented his
hopes, and he beheld his felicity with
so much assurance, that he was in
pain for nothing but to know the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
moment. Now he became more as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siduous
about <hi>Iohaime,</hi> whom he had
promised <hi>Fatima</hi> always to treat as his
Sister: but he could not keep his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
long; there are transports in
Love, that are not usual in Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
<hi>Achmet</hi>'s passion was too strong for
a Brother, and soon betrayed it self to
proceed from love. The Princess <hi>Iohai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,</hi>
who had no less wit, than beauty,
observed an alteration in <hi>Achmet</hi>'s
behaviour: he was more particularly
diligent about her; he received the
innocent favours she did him as her
Brother, with more satisfaction than
ordinary, and endeavoured to make
her bestow them oftner on him. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haime</hi>
perceived it, and he saw that
she did. This reflection put him into
confusion, so that he answered her
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51472:78"/>
trembling, when she desired him to
moderate his kindness, which seemed
too passionate for a Brother.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Achmet</hi>'s disorder and ambiguous
words surprized <hi>Iohaime,</hi> 
                        <q>What say
you, said she to him, of Passion and
Love? do you remember that I am
your Sister, and that you ought not
to have any more than an innocent,
and a pure friendship for me?</q> 
                        <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi>
who was no longer master of his
love, found that he had spoken too
much, that he could not counterfeit
any more, and that it was necessary to
undeceive her: besides, a scruple
came into his head of being behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to Friendship for those pleasures,
which he would rather owe to Love.
<q>I should abuse your ignorance, and
credulity too much, fair <hi>Iohaime,</hi>
said he, throwing himself at her
feet; you would have reason here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to reproach me of going about
to surprize your heart by a strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem,
unworthy of a man who
adores you. You are not my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
fair Princess, and love took care
to tell me so before my Mother
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51472:79"/>
confirmed it: but Madam, will
not the confession I make injure
this love? and will the Daughter
of a <hi>Sultana</hi> permit the Son of <hi>Fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
to be her servant? will she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the kindness she had for
<hi>Achmet</hi> when she was yet his Sister?</q>
The Princess <hi>Iohaime,</hi> who was
strangely astonished at this discourse,
beheld <hi>Achmet</hi> at her feet a good
while, without being able to lift him
up, or answer him: but having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
her self, and not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
the truth of all that he said
to her, she made as if she did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
him, to oblige him to speak
more plainly of her condition;
which he did after he had made her
promise inviolable secresie. She ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a tender friendship for <hi>Achmet,</hi>
and being quite ignorant of love, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
still with him as she was wont to
do before she knew that she was not
his Sister, and discovered no great joy
to find a Lover in him, whom she had
always respected as her Brother. But
<hi>Achmet</hi> quickly converted her friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
into a reciprocal love. These
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51472:79"/>
two Lovers were indowed with all
that was capable of maintaining a
lasting passion. They were almost of
the same age, <hi>Achmet</hi> being but two
years older than the Princess. He was
well and proportionably shap'd, his
behaviour and manners pleasing, his
eyes were lively, and sparkling; his
complexion white, and his hair of a
chestnut colour; he went handsomly
about every thing he did; and the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> has been often heard to
say, that he did those exercises which
the Turks usually perform before him,
better than any man in his Empire.
The Princess <hi>Iohaime</hi> had qualities
that rendred her no less amiable: her
shape, though not yet quite formed,
was likely to be the best in the world.
The figure of her face was oval, her
forehead was large, her eyes full;
they were blue, and so sweetly lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing,
that one could not see them
without being sensibly affected; her
nose was of a just bigness; her mouth
and teeth admirable; her complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
incomparable; her hair brown,
and very thick; her <hi>min</hi> answered
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51472:80"/>
the greatness of her birth, and her
wit was perfectly correspondent to
her outward charms: besides all this,
her modesty made all the world adore
her; especially <hi>Achmet,</hi> with whom
she avoided being alone, since the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
which he had made to her:
her chastity reproaching her with
those harmless privacies which she
had before permitted. She lived so
strictly, and reservedly, as hindred
her Lover from taking any of those
liberties which she had given way to,
while she believed him to be her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Never were so many charms,
so much love, and virtue seen toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
She obtained of <hi>Achmet,</hi> that
he should require nothing of her, but
what the most innocent friendship
could not refuse, and that he should
keep his passion secret. They lived
together very calmly, expecting when
fortune would favour their desires, by
rendring them completely happy;
but fate, envying their felicity, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
their repose, by a separation,
which almost killed them with grief.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mahomet Coprogli,</hi> from being a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51472:80"/>
and on the brink of destruction,
became the first Minister of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire; he was no sooner raised
to this degree, but he took care to
render his Son capable of serving the
State under him. He had given <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
better Education than usually
those of his Nation bestow on their
children, and then brought him to
the Court of the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who at the
very first took a kindness to him; and
the <hi>Sultana Valide</hi> perceiving his good
qualities, would have him always be
with her Son <hi>Mahomet,</hi> into whose fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
he so insinuated himself in a
short time, that he could not indure
to be one moment without him: but
the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> had no mind to let his
Sons courage decay among the soft
pleasures of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> intending
him for a man of business; and the
power he had over the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who
minded nothing but his diversions,
prevailed with him to consent that
<hi>Achmet</hi> should go and make his first
Campagna; where he came off with
so much success, that he gained the
esteem of all the Captains: who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51472:81"/>
him begin so well, doubted not
but he would be one of the greatest
men in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire. When
he parted from the Princess <hi>Iohaime,</hi>
he left her in inexpressible sorrow.
<hi>Achmet</hi> would have discovered his
love to his Mother <hi>Fatima,</hi> but <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haime</hi>
opposed it so strongly, that he
durst not do it, for fear of displeasing
her: besides, he was afraid his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would reproach him with his
weakness, and indiscretion, which
might produce an effect contrary to
his wishes: therefore he took leave of
her, after a thousand protestations
of loving one another eternally. Yet
the kindness of these two Lovers at
parting, was not so secret, but that
<hi>Fatima</hi> perceived it; who whether she
already suspected the truth, or feared
the effect of so long a conversation,
interrupted it as soon as she could.
She knew somewhat of her Sons love,
and apprehended the consequence;
not being assured that the <hi>Sultana Valide</hi>
would approve of <hi>Achmets</hi> passion for
<hi>Iohaime.</hi> She thought it convenient to
make use of the opportunity of her
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51472:81"/>
Sons absence, to return the Princess
to her Mother; knowing that when
she was in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> her Son could
not so easily see her, and hold corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
with her: besides, that it
would be more decent for her to be
with her true Parents, than in <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met
Coprogli</hi>'s house, whose Daughter
she was thought to be. Therefore
<hi>Fatima</hi> perswaded the <hi>Sultana Valide</hi> to
have <hi>Iohaime</hi> near her: but the <hi>Sultana</hi>
having some secret reasons why she
would not yet own her for her
Daughter, ordered <hi>Fatima</hi> to present
her to her as the <hi>Visier Azem</hi>'s own
Daughter, which was done without
acquainting <hi>Iohaime,</hi> who was brought
to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> to live with the <hi>Sultana
Valide.</hi> This young Princess who was
not suffered to know her Mother, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
the difficulty she should have
to see <hi>Achmet,</hi> and how grievous this
separation which was contrived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his knowledge, would be to him,
was so sensibly touched at it, that a
great while she pined away; at last
she fell sick, and had no body about
her that she could trust to give <hi>Achmet</hi>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:51472:82"/>
notice of their misfortune. She was
in a place where she was watched very
nearly. She mistrusted <hi>Fatima,</hi> whom
she still called Mother, being thought
to be so by every body. Seeing her
very often, she resolved at last to give
her a Letter, which she said the <hi>Sultan</hi>
had delivered to her to send to her
Brother (so she called her <hi>Achmet;) Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima,</hi>
suspected nothing, taking it to
be a mark of the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to her Son, with whom he was
sometimes very familiar: therefore
she sent the Letter to him, who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it just as he was going to fight,
and opening it found it, written to
this purpose:</p>
                     <p>As if your being exposed to the dangers
of War, and my continual apprehensions of
losing you, were not sufficient to afflict me,
that I may quite despair. I am shut up in
the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> I can accuse no body of it
but your Mooher: I still pass for your Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and I fear lest <hi>Fatima</hi> believes I
love you, and that for that reason she has
shut me up in a place, where your absence is
not the only thing I dread; but return
quickly, and free me from this mortal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51472:82"/>
I am in. Write not back to me, lest
your Letter discover the trick I used to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh
this to you, which your Mother sent
you as from the <hi>Sultan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Achmet</hi> was thunder-strook with
this news, at first despair seized on his
soul, but his hope of dying in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
did a little allay the misfortunes
of his love. The fight drew near,
and he was impatient to be ingaged;
at the first incounter he rushed in
among the thickest, and fought as
one that sought not victory but death;
but his good luck had the better of
despair; he was not so much as hurt;
and his desire of dying which made
him face the greatest dangers, passed
for the effect of an undaunted courage,
and gained him the reputation of one
of the bravest men in the Army. The
Campagna being ended, he returned
to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where his valour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the applauses of all the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees
of the Port, who studied to make
themselves acceptable to the <hi>Grand
Visier</hi> his Father, and the <hi>Sultan</hi> whose
Favorite he was: but all their praises
which perhaps would have satisfied a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51472:83"/>
more vain, or an ambitious man,
did not move him at all. His love
wholly imployed his thoughts, and
he was already weary of those trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
complements that hindred
him from contriving a way to see
his Mistriss. He was warned by her
Letter to mistrust his Mother, and he
employed all his subtilty to know why
she had delivered <hi>Iohaime</hi> to the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana
Valide;</hi> but <hi>Fatima</hi> found out his
drift: She loved him too well, to give
any cause to be angry, or complain of
her; therefore she told him, that the
<hi>Sultana</hi> had asked for the Princess, and
that she was forced to obey her against
her will. <q>I know, added she, that it
makes you melancholy, and I know
the friendship you have for one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
I would have you always
preserve the same thoughts, and
should be glad you could give <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haime</hi>
assurances of them your self;
but since it is impossible, I will do
it for you.</q> 
                        <hi>Achmet</hi> was vexed at
this discourse, but he dissembled his
grief as well as he could, and went
to pay his respects to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51472:83"/>
received him very kindly. After he
had given his Highness an account of
his Campagna, the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> in
requital, told him what he had done
in his absence, and ended his relation
with the praise of <hi>Achmet</hi>'s Sister,
who was come a little before, to be
with the <hi>Sultana Valide</hi> his Mother. If
the <hi>Sultan</hi> had taken notice of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance
that appeared then in his
Favourites countenance, he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
suspected something of his love,
but he did not perceive it; and <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
then discovered part of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness:
he knew not that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Mahomet</hi> was <hi>Iohaime</hi>'s Brother,
and saw nothing that could hinder
him from being her Lover. The
thoughts of this wounded his heart,
and he had almost betrayed himself
by shewing his jealousie; yet at last he
forced himself, and summoned all his
reason to assist him, to beg the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s
permission to see his Sister. None but
<hi>Achmet,</hi> who was so familiar with the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> durst have asked such a
favour which is never granted to any
body; for neither the Father, or the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51472:84"/>
other kindred of the young women
in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> are suffered to see them,
till they go out to be married. The
<hi>Sultan,</hi> who had a secret end in <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi>
discoursing privately with his
Sister, presently granted his request.
He no sooner knew his Masters inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but he was grieved that he had
given him an opportunity of requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
a service of him, that was so
contrary to his passion. The <hi>Sultan</hi>
had seen <hi>Iohaime</hi> a little before with
his Mother, and he found her to be
what she appeared to all the world,
infinitely charming. His heart ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
never yet been ingaged, he soon
lost his liberty, and without consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whether it were as easie to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
as to love. It was not long
before he declared himself to her, not
taking any notice of the <hi>Sultana,</hi> who
he believed would not oppose him.
She being informed of his love, did
all she could to cure him; she employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the arguments she could think
of, to fix him on some other object;
and all her authority was little
enough on this occasion; his obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51472:84"/>
surmounting his respect; yet he
durst not continue his addresses open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for fear of disobliging his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
besides, he was unwilling to
gain the favour of a beauty by force,
which he had rather win by his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
and services; therefore he
courted <hi>Iohaime</hi> secretly, who being
prepossessed in <hi>Achmet Coprogli</hi>'s behalf,
easily defended herself from the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>'s
importunity. Difficulties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
augment love. The <hi>Grand
Signiors</hi> was heightned by the resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
he found; but being naturally
gallant, and free from those brutish
inclinations which most of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
were subject to: he would try
all honourable means to perswade <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haime</hi>
to admit of his passion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that his Favourite <hi>Achmet,</hi>
(whom he took to be her Brother)
might induce her to be kind to him.
In order to this, he desired the <hi>Sultana
Valide</hi> by a particular priviledge, to
give the <hi>Grand Visier</hi>'s Son leave to
converse with his Sister. The <hi>Sultana,</hi>
who had thwarted her Sons inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
thought it not prudent to refuse
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51472:85"/>
what he asked in <hi>Achmet</hi>'s behalf, lest
her denial should provoke him to
transgress those bounds of respect he
had hitherto kept: therefore she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
that <hi>Iohaime</hi> should receive a
visit from <hi>Achmet;</hi> but she charged her
under pain of her displeasure, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse
the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s addresses, and to be
deaf to what ever the Favorite should
plead in his Masters behalf. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
was needless; <hi>Iohaime</hi>'s own
interest was more prevalent with her
than any command; as soon as the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> had obtained the <hi>Sultana's</hi>
consent, he ran to find <hi>Achmet,</hi> who
waited impatiently for him in his
apartment where he left him. There,
with a rapture of Joy which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his hope of succeeding in his
love, <q>You may my dear <hi>Achmet,</hi> see
the fair <hi>Iohaime</hi> when you please; I
have with great difficulty obtained
my Mothers leave; and I believe
you will thank me for it, and do me
all the good offices, that I may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
my self from your friendship:
you have a great deal of power with
her, and I hope you will make use of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51472:85"/>
it to make me happy; for (added
he) I will no longer conceal from
you my love for your Sister: the
<hi>Sultana Valide</hi> opposed it, she forces
charming <hi>Iohaime</hi> to be cruel to me, it
may be against her will: but you may
assure her, that it is her own fault
if she be not <hi>Grand Sultana.</hi>
                        </q> This
declaration made with all the earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a tender and passionate Lover,
so surprized him, that it was a good
while before he could answer him.
The <hi>Sultan</hi> could not tell what to
make of this. <q>What? (said he) will
you too declare against my love?</q>
These words uttered with some vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence,
brought <hi>Achmet</hi> out of the
confusion he was in; and hiding as
well as he could the jealousie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
which the Emperors love for his
Princess filled his soul with, he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
himself so well as to say, <q>Your
passion, Sir, honours <hi>Iohaime</hi> too
much, and I have too much respect
for your Highness, to contradict
your desires; but I am afraid of
creating some mis-understanding
between you and the <hi>Sultana Valide,</hi>
                           <pb n="162" facs="tcp:51472:86"/>
by assisting your love. You know,
Sir, that your Mother is positive in
her opinion, and will be obey'd; if
she does not approve of your kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for my Sister, and comes to hear
of my negotiation; she will never
pardon me, or <hi>Iohaime,</hi> and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
me from you, will render
me incapable of serving you.</q> The
<hi>Grand Signior,</hi> who was pre-possessed by
his love, made him a thousand prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations
to protect him, and free him
from all that he apprehended: and
conjuring him to pity his affection,
cast him into a strange confusion.
This Favourite had two things to
choose, which were more cruel to him
than death; on one side he saw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in danger of losing his Masters
favour, whom he infinitely esteemed,
if he refused to serve him in his love;
and on the other hand, he was forced
to speak against his own interest, in
behalf of the most dangerous Rival in
the world: for the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> was
not only considerable for his high
birth, and the possession of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Empire on earth; but he was furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51472:86"/>
with qualities that rendred him
very acceptable. This Prince is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being strongly ingaged, and
his conduct has manifested that he is
very constant in love, his soul is great,
and royal, his humour is chearful, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable,
and familiar, but not indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
with every body; for he can
be grave on occasion, and that with
so much majesty, as imprints an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
awe: his shape is not very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous,
but it was straight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he fell from his Horse one day in
leaping a ditch in hunting, which hurt
him on the left side, and makes him a
little crooked. He has the finest eyes
that a man can have; his mouth
is good, his complexion is a little gross,
and not very smooth, since he had the
Small Pox; his beard is of Chesnut
colour, like as his hair; his gate is
grave, and though his constitution be
somewhat tender, yet he is very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous:
he is very skilful in the use
of the Bow, and the Musquet; he is
exceeding generous, and when he has
any War in hand, lays aside all his
pleasures<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> though he loves them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51472:87"/>
The knowledge of so much
desert did strangely alarm <hi>Achmet,</hi>
however he resolved to promise the
<hi>Sultan</hi> any thing rather than lose the
opportunity of seeing the Princess,
who was as impatient to impart her
discontents, and the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi>
addresses, to him. The first moments
of their interview (which was in the
Gardens of the <hi>Seraglio</hi>) were taken up
with tears of joy to see one another
again. The rest of the time was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in expressing all that two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Lovers could say to one another,
after a long absence. They acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one another with the Emperor
<hi>Mahomet</hi>'s love, and contrived what
they should do to hide their own:
but they could not find any way to be
soon happy, and to protect their love
from the storm that threatned it in
the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> The <hi>Sultans</hi> passion was
an impediment to their felicity. <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
was forbid to own that he knew
<hi>Iohaime</hi>'s birth, and she durst not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that <hi>Fatima</hi> was not her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
so that they were obliged to
keep a secret that contributed to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51472:87"/>
their unhappiness, They concluded
that they ought not to put the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> in despair, lest they should
want a pretence to see one another;
and after a thousand reiterated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations
of inviolable fidelity, <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
took his leave of her, to go and
give <hi>Mahomet</hi> an account of his nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
who waited for his return
with all the disquiet of an impatient
Lover. He told him that he found
more difficulty in perswading his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
than he imagined he should;
and that her fear of displeasing the
<hi>Sultana Valide</hi> made her refuse the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
which his Highness offered her;
but that he hoped in time to render
her more flexible, provided he might
have the liberty of conversing pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
with her sometimes. The
Emperor embraced his Favourite, and
promised him his favour on all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that might require it. In the
mean time <hi>Achmet</hi> and <hi>Iohaime,</hi> who
abused the <hi>Sultans</hi> credulity, to carry
on their love, had new subjects of
complaint, and were once more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to suffer the torments which Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51472:88"/>
feel in long absence. <hi>Mahomet
Coprogli</hi> sent his Son with a powerful
Army against the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and
Prince <hi>Soliman Amurath</hi> who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be the lawful successor of the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire. This second sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
afflicted him more than the
first; he could not resolve to go, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
discovering his passion to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and making her promise him
that she would assist him, and oppose
Prince <hi>Mahomet. Fatima</hi> perceiving
her Sons despair, promised him all
that he desired, and told him she
would endeavour to make him happy;
and that if he would write to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
<hi>Iohaime,</hi> she would deliver his
Letters to her, and send him her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers:
But she required of him that
he would trust her to mannage his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
with the <hi>Sultana Valide,</hi> lest he
should provoke the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> who
would have reason to be angry, if he
should come to know his falshood.
These assurances did a little compose
<hi>Achmets</hi> mind; he marched against
the enemy with more courage, and
fought them so successfully, that he
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51472:88"/>
defeated them; and he took the new
Prince <hi>Soliman Amurath</hi> and the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
<hi>Bassa</hi> prisoners: and his good
fortune was such, that the <hi>Sophy</hi> of
<hi>Persia,</hi> who intended to besiege <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
being informed that <hi>Achmet</hi> was
coming to its relief, left his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise
imperfect. After this expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he returned glorious, and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where all the
applause that he met with, did not
please him so much as the hope of
seeing his Princess. But this joy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
not long; for fate envying his
felicity, soon put an end to it: he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to have laid all those Laurels
which love had animated him to win,
at the feet of <hi>Iohaime:</hi> but the <hi>Sultana
Valide</hi> apprehending the consequences
of her Son <hi>Mahomets</hi> passion for <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haime,</hi>
to keep him from seeing her,
had confined her to a secret apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
pretending that she was sick,
and was to bathe her self privately.
The sorrow and melancholy that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in <hi>Iohaime</hi>'s countenance,
made her pretended sickness probable
enough. The report of her being
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51472:89"/>
sick, soon spread abroad, and <hi>Achmet</hi>
heard it before his Mother could have
time to disabuse him, by telling him
the true cause of her feigned indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.
She loved her Son too well
to let him continue in his mistake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that since she had discovered
more important secrets to him, she
ought not to let him be ignorant that
nothing troubled <hi>Iohaime</hi> but his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
By this means she comforted
him a little, but could not quite cure
him of the melancholy which the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility
of seeing his Princess put
him into. In the mean while the
<hi>Sultana Valide</hi> endeavoured to take off
the <hi>Sultans</hi> thoughts from <hi>Iohaime,</hi> by
making him fall in love with some
other beauty. She found none so ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of ingaging him as a young <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diot,</hi>
named <hi>Eugenia.</hi> She was a Greek,
and a Christian, and was born at <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo</hi>
a Town in <hi>Candia,</hi> from whence
she was taken away very young, and
made a Slave, when the Turks made
their first descent upon that Island,
and took, and sacked <hi>Retimo</hi> in the
reign of <hi>Ibrahim.</hi> She changed her
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51472:89"/>
name into that of <hi>Zachi,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
dear, or favourite, in respect of
her beauty, which gave place to
none. Her stature was moderate,
but so just, that it could not be higher
or lower, without losing some of its
grace: her complexion was admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
white and smooth: her eyes were
so lively and sparkling that one could
not discern their colour: her mouth
and teeth incomparable: her hair of
the finest black that was ever seen:
her neck and arms as one would wish
them: her <hi>min</hi> and behaviour were so
agreeable, that it was impossible for
<hi>Sultan Mahomet,</hi> notwithstanding all
the pre-possession of his soul, not to
yield to so many charms. He found
<hi>Zachi</hi> so handsome and so witty, that
he could not keep himself from show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Iohaime</hi> had not so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved
him, as to hinder her from
having some influence on him. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genia</hi>
was strictly charged by the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana
Valide</hi> to neglect nothing that
might ingage the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to
love her; but the <hi>Sultans</hi> own merit,
and good qualities prevailed more
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51472:90"/>
with her than this command. So ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
a beauty as <hi>Zachi</hi> finds no
great difficulty in the conquest of so
tender a heart as the <hi>Grand Signiors.</hi>
With this new Mistress he diverted
the melancholy that <hi>Iohaime</hi>'s sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
had caused: but unhappy <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi>
who could love none but his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
grieved almost to death that he
did not see her: and to increase his
sorrow, the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> his Father,
who thought of nothing but the good
of the State, and of making his Son
capable of being hereafter necessary
to his Master, without reflecting on
<hi>Achmets</hi> amours, or giving him time
to contrive any thing, sent him into
<hi>Dalmatia,</hi> to make War on the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
who were at the same time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
in <hi>Candia.</hi> His obedience to
his Father, and his own glory, obliged
him to sacrifice his Love to his Duty:
therefore he went away without any
other comfort, than that of writing a
Letter to his Princess. His Mother
promised him to deliver it into her
own hand. Without staying for an
answer he went to besiege <hi>Clissa,</hi> where,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51472:90"/>
as I have already told you, he beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
himself with extraordinary cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
<hi>Fatima</hi> was not very punctual
in delivering her Sons Letter, but at
last she sent it to <hi>Iohaime,</hi> who found
it to this purpose.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Fate, the enemy of my joy, and
repose, hinders me from seeing you,
my Princess, and I go a great way
off from you, to seek death, which
alone can put an end to my pains:
my duty takes me against my will
from the place where my love would
detain me. I know not at my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
what your thoughts are;
but if you continue the same to me,
I presently know what I ought to
be.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iohaime</hi> received this Letter with
such sorrow, as is easier to imagine
than express; she could not restrain
her complaints and tears from break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out, just when the <hi>Sultan</hi> passed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the window where she was, not
knowing that she was in this Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which in a very remote quarter
looks into the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s Garden. He
was wholly taken up with his new
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51472:91"/>
passion, which led him to <hi>Eugenia.</hi>
The Princess blinded, with her tears,
did not see him, but the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
hearing some body sigh, looked up,
and discovered <hi>Iohaime.</hi> This sight
both moved his compassion, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
him to see her there whom he
believed to be at the <hi>Sultana</hi>'s private
baths, whither no man, not so much
as the <hi>Sultan</hi> himself ever comes. His
flame which was not quite extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
was presently kindled again
with more heat than before; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
his design of visiting fair <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi>
he endeavoured to learn of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haime</hi>
the cause of her sorrow, and
why she was lodged in so solitary a
place. She wondering to hear her
self named, and knowing the <hi>Sultans</hi>
voice, notwithstanding all that he
could urge to her, retired from the
window without speaking to him.
This behaviour of hers so raised <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets</hi>
curiosity, that he ran to the
<hi>Sultana Valide's</hi> Apartment, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
furiously asked her where <hi>Iohaime</hi>
was, saying he would see her imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.
The <hi>Sultana</hi> taking notice
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51472:91"/>
of her Sons disorder, and vehemence,
answered him very calmly, that he
might be easily satisfied; and adding
flattery to this assurance, desired him
to tell her, whence his suddain curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
proceeded. The Prince who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and respected his Mother ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely,
being a little appeased, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to her what had hapned to him.
The <hi>Sultana</hi> was much surprized at
this adventure, not being able to guess
at the cause of <hi>Iohaime's</hi> affliction:
but it was necessary to satisfie the
<hi>Grand Signior,</hi> who challenged her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and would needs know why <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haime</hi>
was removed under pretence of
sickness. This question strangely
perplexed the <hi>Sultana,</hi> who now saw
the secret, which she had particular
reasons to conceal, in danger of being
discovered: but at last she told him,
that being informed of his love to <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haime,</hi>
who for some reasons which she conjur'd him not to inquire farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
at present, could not possibly come
to be <hi>Sultana;</hi> she had removed her in
hopes of abating his passion by her
absence, and engaging him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51472:92"/>
else: but since her caution pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to no purpose, he might see her
if he pleased; and that she believed
when he once knew the obstacles of
his love, he would continue it no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
Then she gave him her hand,
and bid him lead her to <hi>Iohaime's</hi>
Chamber, who was in such confusion,
that she never thought of hiding <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>'s
Letter. The <hi>Sultan</hi> seeing it
on a cushion, snatched it up, and
having read it, he turned briskly to
the <hi>Sultana Valide,</hi> with his eyes spark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with anger, and jealousie: <q>Well
Madam, said he, was it perfidious
<hi>Achmets</hi> love then, that was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
obstacle of my passion?
do you betray me to favour the
<hi>Grand Visiers</hi> Son, who by abusing
my goodness, kept a correspondence
with her whom I always took to be
his Sister? And you, ingrateful wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</q>
continued he, addressing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to <hi>Iohaime,</hi> 
                        <q>Could the love of
a Slave make you so firm, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in your denials to me? but I
know how to be revenged on your
contempt, and the treachery of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51472:92"/>
your base lover.</q> Then fury and
grief not suffering him to say any
more, he would have gone away from
them to have satisfied his rage by
some cruel action or other, when the
<hi>Sultana Valide</hi> who was astonished at
the discovery of the intrigue between
<hi>Achmet</hi> and <hi>Iohaime,</hi> immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
that it was necessary to disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and prevent his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment
of the deceit that had been
put upon him. She staid him by the
arm, and with tears in her eyes desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to hear her. Then she told
him that <hi>Iohaime</hi> was his Sister, and
why she had concealed it from him;
conjuring him to own her and love her
as he ought to do. Anger and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
now gave place to reason, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness;
and nature spake more in
<hi>Iohaime's</hi> behalf, than all that her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could say. He immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lented,
and wondered he had not
sooner found out the meaning of those
secret agitations that were caused by
nearness of blood. He embraced his
Mother, and his Sister, giving marks
of a most pure and violent inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51472:93"/>
and a very particular esteem of
her virtue. He promised her that
since she loved the <hi>Visier Azem</hi>'s Son,
he would not hinder their happiness:
and from thenceforwards he addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himself more assiduously to fair
<hi>Zachi</hi> who was owned as <hi>Sultana,</hi> as
soon as she was perceived to be with
Child. He loved this Princess so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,
and respectfully, that he has
always contrived his secret intrigues,
to which he is much inclined, with
such caution, as to avoid giving her
any cause to be jealous.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time valiant <hi>Achmet</hi>
hazarded his life against the <hi>Venetians,</hi>
at the Siege of <hi>Clissa,</hi> the Capital Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> from whence the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> Army was forced to retire:
which afforded him leisure to return
to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> He knew nothing
of what had hapned in the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> in
his absence, because the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
having a mind to surprize him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
at his return, had charged <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima</hi>
not to send him word of any
thing. When <hi>Achmet</hi> came to wait
on him, he received him with open
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51472:93"/>
arms, and looking more chearfully
than he was wont; after he had ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him some questions about the
War, he took him aside, to tell him
that he was not only obliged to him
for his diligence in serving him, and
exposing his life for his glory; but
that he was more particularly behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to him for the good offices he had
done him in his love, which had suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
according to his wishes: for
at last, dear <hi>Achmet,</hi> continued he, I
am conqueror; your Sister <hi>Iohaime</hi> is
no more cruel to me, and I enjoy
those delights in her that make me
perfectly happy. He accompanied
this discourse with such transports of
joy, that unfortunate <hi>Achmet</hi> believed
him. His colour changed, and his
heart was quite overcome with grief:
all the respect he had for the Emperor
could not hinder him from yielding to
his infirmity; and his strength failed
him so, that the <hi>Sultan</hi> seeing him rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to sink down, was afraid he would
have died upon the place: when, not
to torment him any longer, <q>Can
You <hi>Achmet,</hi> said he, holding him up,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51472:94"/>
faint away, when the time you
have so ardently wished for is arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?
the Princess <hi>Iohaime</hi> is still
faithful to you, and may yet before
night, assure you her self that she
loves you more than ever.</q> Nothing
less than this could have recalled amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Achmet</hi> from death. But he was
in doubt still whether he should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> he could not
flatter himself with such hopes, or
imagine which way such a change
should happen. The <hi>Sultan</hi> soon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
him by expressing himself
more clearly: he told him how he
found out the secret of his love, and
the mystery of his Sisters birth, which
had been so long concealed from him;
and without any more delay, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
night concluded the marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Achmet</hi> and <hi>Iohaime.</hi> He sent
to acquaint the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> with it,
and celebrated his Favourites marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
with extraordinary magnificence.
Thus were these two Lovers rendred
happy, and for many years tasted the
sweets of a consummate love.</p>
                     <p>This alliance which according to
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51472:94"/>
the maxims of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperors,
ought to have removed <hi>Achmet Copro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli</hi>
from the supreme Ministry, by an
extraordinary event proved the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
that obliged the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
to slight the policy of his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
who rather chose to marry their
Daughters and Sisters to simple <hi>Bassa</hi>'s,
than to their <hi>Grand Visiers,</hi> lest they
should make use of that honour in the
frequent Seditions that molest their
Empire; and secretly contrive the
destruction of the Males of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Family, that by their alliance
they may have right to pretend to the
Crown.</p>
                     <p>The Emperor <hi>Mahomet</hi> by confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the charge of <hi>Visier Azem</hi> on his
Brother-in-law, shewed that a Prince
ought not to be a slave to Policy; that
he is above Laws and Customs; that
he should not submit to them any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then he finds them advantagious
to his State and Glory; and that he
is always at liberty to reform them,
or establish new ones, when there is
occasion, or necessity requires it. He
could not have made a better choice
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51472:95"/>
to supply the first charge of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
and though he did not find
as much experience in <hi>Achmet Coprogli,</hi>
as in his Father, at least he met with
the same zeal for his service, the same
courage in the highest undertakings,
and the same genius and resolution in
the greatest affairs.</p>
                     <p>As soon as <hi>Achmet</hi> was invested in
his new Dignity, he shewed the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his soul, and the strength of
his wit; for as young as he was, he
was no more surprized, or confused in
this place; the burthen of which so
few Subjects are vigorous enough to
support, than if he had the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the ablest Politicians, and
greatest Statesmen. He followed his
Fathers foot-steps so exactly, that no
body could perceive any other change
in the administration, than that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
from the Father to the Son;
and that one was as expert as the
other, who was the greatest, and
most judicious Minister that ever ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
the affairs of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
                     <p>This young Minister therefore imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51472:95"/>
his Father <hi>Mahomet Coprogli,</hi>
acted every thing with wonderful pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
he at first accustomed him self
never to let either Malice, Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Anger, or Haste, which are the
four dangerous shelves of ready and
and subtil wits, to have any influence
on his resolution. He is always me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical
in his discourse, judicious in
what he writes, sincere in his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
punctual in his promises, secret in
his orders, quick, and ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
and very constant in his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.
His good qualities made
the other <hi>Visiers</hi> and <hi>Bassa's</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi>
jealous of him, who could not
endure that a young man should be
preferred before them, whom they
were obliged to own as their Superior,
and to submit their opinion to his.
The most powerful and discontented
of those who pretended to the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Grand Visier</hi> was <hi>Rustan Bey, Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>
of <hi>Babylon.</hi> He had great intrigues
at the Port, and abundance of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
among the <hi>Spahies</hi> and <hi>Ianiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
that were at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whither
the <hi>Sultan</hi> was not returned since the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51472:96"/>
death of the <hi>Visier Azem.</hi> He enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them underhand to mutiny, and
endeavour by threats to oblige the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> to name another <hi>Grand
Visier;</hi> but the Emperor as soon as he
was out of his <hi>minority,</hi> made himself
absolute among them; and after the
example of <hi>Sultan Amurath</hi> his Unkle,
often came abroad to see them exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.
By this means he shewed that
he had more courage, and resolution
than his male-content Subjects were
willing to allow him; and that the
<hi>Sultana Valide,</hi> and the <hi>Visier Mahomet
Coprogli</hi> had given him a more heroick
education than any <hi>Ottoman</hi> Prince
ever had before him. That great and
faithful Minister taught him to behave
himself like an Emperor, and to make
use of his Sovereign power. The <hi>Sultan</hi>
therefore had a mind to practise his
lessons, and imploy his policy in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the choice he had made of his
Son to succeed him in his charge, and
keeping the mutineers in order. He
was not ignorant of the mischievous
consequences of Seditions; and that
it is difficult to appease them, when
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51472:96"/>
the people and the Militia are united
in a Rebellion. He concluded with
the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> that it was necessary
to gain the chief leaders of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoes,</hi>
by distributing mony among
them, to oblige them to withdraw
their Troops from the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
These two sorts of Militia, as
we have elsewhere mentioned, have
been always opposed to one another;
nor was it difficult to divide them.
The <hi>Spahies</hi> being appeased by the <hi>Visier
Azems</hi> liberality, not only laid down
their Arms, but promised also to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> attempts; who on
the other side fearing the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors</hi>
menaces, and hoping to be as
well rewarded as the <hi>Spahies,</hi> if they
returned to their duty, declared that
they were ready to punish those that
were guilty, This submission caused
the <hi>Sultan</hi> immediately to leave <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anople,</hi>
to come and quiet the trouble
at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> by taking advantage
of the <hi>Spahies</hi> zeal to suppress the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious.
He assembled the <hi>Divan,</hi>
whither he came himself with all the
<hi>Bassa's</hi> and Officers of the Port, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51472:97"/>
the principal of the City; and with
some sharpness told them how much it
displeased him, that they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
his actions, and that the <hi>Iani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi>
should go about to impose laws
on him. He spoke with so much Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
that he strook an awe into the
most insolent. At the same time he
gave order to seize the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
who was the chief author of the
Sedition, the <hi>Aga,</hi> and the most cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
Officers of the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> and
some of the principal inhabitants,
causing them all to be strangled; and
threatned to cashier the whole body
of the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> if ever they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
the least disorder.</p>
                     <p>This proceeding seemed the more
rigorous to these Troops, because
they expected more favourable usage;
but they durst not complain. The
<hi>Grand Visier</hi> in the mean time in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to his Fathers maxims,
thought it necessary to employ the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries,</hi>
that they might have no lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to mutiny again. He intended
to continue the Siege of <hi>Candia,</hi> but
he would first make an end of the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:51472:97"/>
                        <hi>Transylvanian</hi> War, which <hi>Ali Bassa</hi>
managed with no great success: and
he was preparing himself to march
with the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> and <hi>Spahies,</hi> when
he was informed that the <hi>Sophy</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi>
was about to attaque <hi>Bagdet.</hi> This
news changed the face of things, and
made the <hi>Sultan</hi> send an <hi>Aga,</hi> and a
<hi>Chiaux</hi> to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to propose a Peace
to the Emperor. These Envoys met
not with that satisfaction that the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
Azem</hi> wished. The Emperor gave
them to understand, that the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality
of <hi>Transylvania,</hi> which was the
cause of his difference with the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
was a member that had been se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from his Estate, and that his
Highness could not without injustice
think of obliging him to quit his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions
to that Province, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
Prince <hi>Chimin Ianos,</hi> who had put
himself into his protection: and that
he could not agree to the dismantling
of <hi>Serinwar,</hi> unless the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
would demolish the Fortifications of
<hi>Waradin,</hi> and some other places.</p>
                     <p>This answer did not please the
<hi>Grand Visier,</hi> who was no less careful
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51472:98"/>
than his Father had been, of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
glory, and industrious to enlarge
his Dominions: but hearing for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that the <hi>Sophy</hi> marched against
<hi>Bagdet,</hi> he saw it was necessary to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porize
now: therefore he sent orders
to <hi>Ali Bassa,</hi> the General of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in <hi>Transylvania,</hi> to continue the
overtures of Peace. This General at
the same time received the news of
the taking of <hi>Chimen Ianos</hi> by <hi>Michael
Abaffi,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Count Barelay,</hi>
and was protected by the Port in his
pretences to <hi>Transylvania.</hi> The death
of <hi>Chimin Ianos,</hi> whom <hi>Abaffi</hi> caused
to be beheaded in Prison, as <hi>Chimin</hi>
had treated his first Competitor, faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated
the Conquest of the Province,
and favoured the <hi>Grand Visiers</hi> designs.
<hi>Ali Bassa</hi> immediately sent a Courrier
to him to know what he should do in
this conjuncture; but <hi>Achmet</hi> sent him
word again that he should observe the
orders he had received: so that he
pressed the Emperor to send Deputies
to the Port to negotiate a Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Empires. In the mean
time the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army made conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51472:98"/>
inroads into <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Troops did the like in the <hi>Grand
Signiors</hi> Dominions. But the Turks
being tired with this tedious skirmish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
War, threatned the coming down
of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> himself with
a formidable Army to invade <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi>
if the Emperor did not very sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
conclude a Peace; which made
him dispatch Doctor <hi>Perez</hi> to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van.</hi>
The <hi>Grand Visier,</hi> whose drift
was to prolong the Negotiation till
his own affairs were in a better po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
dismissed him, with order to
tell his Master that he should send his
<hi>Agats</hi> to <hi>Themidwar,</hi> to treat there
with <hi>Ali Bassa,</hi> and the <hi>Cappigi Bassa:</hi>
but hearing that the <hi>Sophy</hi> for fear of
being invaded by the <hi>Mogol,</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
over his enterprize on <hi>Babylon,</hi> he
commanded General <hi>Ali</hi> not to recede
from the first conditions which he had
proposed in order to the conclusion of
the Peace.</p>
                     <p>The Emperor finding the <hi>Sultans</hi>
propositions unreasonable, and that
the Turks continued their Incursions,
believed, the <hi>Divan,</hi> whatever it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51472:99"/>
had no desire to terminate the
War: therefore he began to look
about him betimes, for fear of being
surprized; foreseeing that it would
not be long before the <hi>Grand Visier</hi>
would fall upon him; who, as soon as
he had put the particular affairs of
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire into order, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to pursue the enterprize which his
Father began, and was forced to leave
unfinished by death. After he had
rigged a powerful Navy to encounter
the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
whose Forces he apprehended at
Sea, he prepared to march against the
Emperor, to let his Master see that he
was as expert as the old Generals,
who proud of their long command,
and age, flighted him as a young man,
and raised disadvantageous stories of
him. He ordered the <hi>Bassa's</hi> of <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
Natolia, Buda,</hi> and some others, to
draw towards <hi>Hungary</hi> with their
Troops, and desired the <hi>Sultan</hi> to stay
at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and to permit him to go
and exercise his Authority, and give
proofs of his valour. He led with
him the old bands of <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51472:99"/>
                        <hi>Spahies,</hi> placing the Mutineers in the
Forlorn Hope, that they might be cut
off in this War, which he hoped to
finish in a short time, that he might
turn all the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Forces against
<hi>Candia.</hi> But while he marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Hungary,</hi> his Fleet which he
set forth to scour the Sea, and succor
<hi>Canea,</hi> which was distressed by the
<hi>Venetian</hi> Army, was not so successful
as he expected: it shun'd ingaging the
<hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet, which would have
fought to have prevented the relief of
<hi>Canea.</hi> The same Fleet however pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
Turkish Gallies in the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chipelago</hi>
so briskly, that it took ten
Saiques, gave chace to four great
Vessels that followed a Caravan of
<hi>Alexandria;</hi> and being come up with
them, took three, and several Saiques
that carried abundance of persons of
quality of both Sexes, who were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecha.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The news of this disgrace did more
inflame the <hi>Grand Visiers</hi> courage, who
made long marches to arrive at <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade,</hi>
where the body of the Army
expected him under the conduct of <hi>Ali
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51472:100"/>
Bassa,</hi> who was newly made <hi>Visier</hi> of
<hi>Hungary.</hi> The approach of this great
Minister, and the arrival of the <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa's</hi>
of <hi>Bossina, Silestria, Waradin, Aleppo,</hi>
and the <hi>Beglerbeg</hi> of <hi>Natolia,</hi> so terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Emperor, that he presently
commanded the <hi>Baron de Goez,</hi> one of
his Deputies, to divert the dreadful
storm that threatned the Empire, by
granting several of the demands
which <hi>Ali Bassa</hi> made in the <hi>Grand
Signior's</hi> name. <hi>Ali</hi> acquainted the
<hi>Grand Visier</hi> upon what terms the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
was willing to purchase Peace:
that he consented that <hi>Michel Abassi</hi>
who was under his Highnesses prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
should be acknowledged Prince
of <hi>Transylvania,</hi> and promised to
withdraw his Garrisods out of some
places, and to demolish the Fort of
<hi>Serinwar:</hi> but <hi>Achmet</hi> had no mind to
go back now he was so forward, and
had made such preparations for the
War; thinking it below him to make
Peace on any conditions, either less
advantageous to his Master, or less
glorious for himself, than the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
that seemed to attend his
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51472:100"/>
Arms; and for this reason, not being
satisfied with what the Emperor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.
He asked over and above,
two millions for the expences he had
been at, with a Tribute of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand Rixdollers a year for
the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> which he
resolved to make wholly tributary to
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire. Besides this,
he would have the Emperor give free
passage for what Troops the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> pleased to send into the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>
Territories.</p>
                     <p>These proud demands made the
Emperor despair of the accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he had hitherto flattered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
withal. He perceived that the
<hi>Grand Visier</hi> would not let the <hi>Iani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi>
return to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> till their
fierceness and insolence were abated
by the toils of a War, which through
the animosity of both parties would
undoubtedly prove very bloody.
<hi>Achmet Coprogli</hi> being informed of
the Emperors continual preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for War, was glad to meet
with resistance in such an Enemy,
whose defeat would augment his
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51472:101"/>
glory, and convince the world that
he was as able in the Camp, as in
the <hi>Divan;</hi> and could not only
advise like an Oracle, but could
command also like a great Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>

                     <p>THE Emperor seeing his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
return without any
effect of their Negotiation,
made no question but that the <hi>Visier
Azem</hi> would endeavour all he could
to come and besiege him in <hi>Vienna.</hi>
Therefore he fortified that City, that
it might be in a condition, if need
were, to resist the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Forces,
implored the assistance of all the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates
of <hi>Europe,</hi> and with four
distinct Armies secured the heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Provinces of the Empire. The
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51472:102"/>
                        <hi>Grand Visier</hi> on the other side aimed
at some considerable Expedition, and
having determined what to do, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the long Bridge of <hi>Essek,</hi> and sate
down before <hi>Newhausel.</hi> He immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
invested the place, and defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
some Troops which Count <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi>
and <hi>Balsi,</hi> and Marquiss <hi>Pio,</hi> would
have put into it, then he summoned
it according to the custom of the
Turks, who do so to all places they
besiege. But Count <hi>Forgats</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
having given such an answer
to his summons, as made him find
that fair words and splendid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
were not sufficient arguments
to perswade him to surrender a place
which the Emperor had intrusted
him with: he planted so furious a
Battery as soon made breaches wide
enough to invite the Turks to an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault,
in which great numbers of
them were slain by the defendants.
But the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> pressed the Siege
so vigorously, that the Governour was
forced to yield the place upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
and the Articles were so
advantagious, that several of the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51472:102"/>
Officers, and the chief of the besieged
knowing to what necessity of surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
the Town was reduced, and
what multitudes of their Enemies
had perished before their Walls in so
small a time, were of opinion at first
that the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> readily consented
to whatever Count <hi>Forgats</hi> demanded,
with design to break his word, and
to have it the sooner in his power to
revenge the loss he had sustained du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Siege: but the event shewed
that they did him wrong to suspect he
could be guilty of a baseness so much
below the greatness of his soul, though
otherwise such actions are very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
among the Turks. <hi>Achmet Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>progli</hi>
has always profest himself an
enemy to treachery, and thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
concerned in honour to keep his
word on all occasions. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Newhausel</hi> was the first that
found this to be true; the good usage
he received from the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
him to be just to his vertue
and desert, and far from what his
Officers apprehended, to thank him
for the complement he made him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51472:103"/>
his generous defence of a Town
which seemed incapable of holding
out against so powerful an Army.</p>
                     <p>Count <hi>Forgats</hi> being marched out
of <hi>Newhausel,</hi> the <hi>Visier Azem</hi> made
his entry into it, and at the same time
dispatched an Officer to carry the
news to the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
to make an entire conquest of
<hi>Hungary,</hi> to accomplish it without
shedding of blood, for ruining the
Country, he bethought himself of
issuing out a Proclamation, that all
the places that would submit to the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, should be exempted
from Contribution for six years, at
the end of which each house should
pay but a Rixdoller. This did not
succeed so well as he expected; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he possessed himself of <hi>Schinta,
Novigrad, Levens,</hi> and some other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of less importance, with which
he ended the Campagna, that he
might refresh his Army, and be at
leisure to look after the affairs of the
Port, which he still took care of, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the War. To this end
he had Courriers continually on the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51472:103"/>
way, who informed him of all that
passed, and carried messages from him
to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who was then at <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anople,</hi>
where he made publick rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings
for three days together for the
Victories of his chief Minister, and
concluded them with the death of his
principal <hi>Nectangis</hi> or Secretary. His
Highness caused him to be beheaded
upon the advice he had from the <hi>Visier
Azem,</hi> that he was corrupted by the
Emperors Ministers, from whom he
had received a very considerable sum
of money, which was found in his
Coffers; being not only a certain ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of his Crime, but a mark of
<hi>Achmet Coprogli</hi>'s faithful correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in all parts. The season of the
year which obliged the <hi>Visier</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
did not hinder him from send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Succors to <hi>Canea,</hi> and Recruits to
the Troops that were in <hi>Dalmatia;</hi>
so that at the same time that he had
undertaken another War, he pressed
the <hi>Venetians</hi> in two several places, to
show the Christian Princes, that the
<hi>Sultan</hi> could maintain more Armies
than one against his Enemies, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51472:104"/>
that he did not at all fear the great
preparations they threatned him
with; being advertised that <hi>Count
Serini</hi> did very much distress the
Troops that wintered in the conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
places, and along the River <hi>Traag,</hi>
and <hi>Dravus.</hi> He composed three
small Armies of Tartars, Moldavians,
and some Turkish Companies to wast
<hi>Moravia,</hi> and <hi>Silesia,</hi> and to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads
as far as <hi>Presburg,</hi> the Capital
City of <hi>Hungary,</hi> by that means to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
Count <hi>Serini,</hi> who by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and the Diet at <hi>Ratisbon</hi> was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
<hi>Generalissimo</hi> of the <hi>Hungarian</hi>
Forces. But neither these Forces,
nor the extremity of Winter, could
hinder this Hero from taking <hi>Berne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet,
Raboscha, Seques,</hi> and several other
places which the Turks had conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
He made himself Master of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanka,</hi>
and <hi>Peez,</hi> a populous trading
Town; and leaving his Army under
the conduct of Count <hi>Horlac,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
and took <hi>Tainskirken,</hi> and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked
the Bridge of <hi>Essek,</hi> where he
met with a vigorous resistance, which
however could not keep him from
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:51472:104"/>
burning that, and many Magazines
which the Turks had along the River
<hi>Dravus.</hi> After this he undertook the
Siege of <hi>Canisia,</hi> a place of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> hearing of this
Siege, was resolved to go in person
and relieve this Town, and stay the
course of Count <hi>Serini</hi>'s conquests;
but the <hi>Visier Azem</hi> dissuaded him from
his design, representing the danger
he exposed himself to, and the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
consequences of his absence
from <hi>Constantinople;</hi> where the people
being provoked at the punishment the
<hi>Sultan</hi> had inflicted on the chief of the
City, who conspired against him,
were ready to rise, and spoke of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
one of his brothers Emperor.
The <hi>Grand Visier</hi> too had a mind to
finish the War he had so happily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,
and was unwilling that his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
presence should rob him of his
glory, and be thought to have effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more than all his industry; yet the
care of his own glory was not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
motive that caused him to divert
<hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> from this expedition,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51472:105"/>
the affection and zeal which he ever
had for his Masters service, at this
time prevailed over all other consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
knowing the violence of
his nature, and the greatness of his
courage, he feared he would engage
himself too far into danger, and that
he would receive more prejudice by
the enterprizes of the Mutineers at
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> than advantage by the
conquest of the whole Kingdom of
<hi>Hungary.</hi> Nor did he doubt but that
he should finish the Expedition suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully,
without the assistance of the
Captains and old Generals that were
in his Army, who out of jealousie op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
his design, and hindred him
from advancing his Conquests so far
as he might have done, if he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
less heed to their counsel, which
he rather chose to follow, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
slowly, than to hazard any thing
upon his own account. Being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of all <hi>Count Serini</hi>'s exploits, who
nearly distressed <hi>Canisia,</hi> and as vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
repulsed <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi>'s For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as his Grandfather did those of
the Emperor <hi>Soliman,</hi> he took the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51472:105"/>
Field to prevent him from joyning
<hi>Canisia</hi> to the other conquests he had
made during the Winter; but the
death of <hi>Ali Bassa</hi> obliged him to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
his intention of repulsing the
enemy, to allow him those Funeral
Ceremonies which his great services
to the state deserved.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ali</hi> was one of the greatest, and most
expert Captains of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:
he bore Arms first under <hi>Sultan
Amurath,</hi> and behaved himself so
well in the Persian War, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
in recompence gave him one of
his Sisters in marriage, and made him
<hi>Bassa</hi>-General of his Armies. He had
gained such reputation, that his power
made the <hi>Grand Visier Mahomet Coprogli</hi>
jealous of him, and resolve to take
away his command of the Army in
<hi>Transylvania,</hi> as we have already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
and he advised his Son to
take heed of him as one that might
well be his Competitor for the charge
of <hi>Grand Visier:</hi> but equitable <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
perceiving the extraordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of this brave man, respected his
virtue and age, which was threescore
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51472:106"/>
and ten; and instead of following
the politic cautions of his Father,
submitted often to his advice, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
deplored his death, which
was also lamented by the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior.</hi>
After he had rendered him all
the Offices that the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law
required, he pursued his march to
<hi>Canisia.</hi> His Army consisted of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
thousand men, whose approach
forced <hi>Count Serini, Count Hohelac,</hi> and
<hi>Strozzi</hi> who were joyned with him,
to raise the Siege, and retire into
the Isle of <hi>Serin.</hi> Their retreat was
but just time enough, for as soon as
they were gone the Turks arrived, and posted themselves in the same
places that the Christians quitted.
The <hi>Grand Visier</hi> having put sufficient
relief into <hi>Canisia,</hi> sent <hi>Ismael Bassa</hi>
with twenty thousand men to pass the
River <hi>Mur</hi> at the place where it joyns
with the <hi>Dravus,</hi> that by getting that
passage, he might have free entry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Stiria, Carinthia,</hi> and <hi>Croatia;</hi> but
<hi>Count Strozzi</hi> valiantly defended the
Pass, and performing the part of a
gallant Souldier, was slain with a
Musquet Bullet.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="203" facs="tcp:51472:106"/>
In the mean time the Emperor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently
expected the Succors he had
desired of the Christian Princes. The
Pope, the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> had promised him large
sums of money, for which he had
great occasion, but they made no
haste to send them. <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi>
gave him hopes of men, but he
heard nothing of their coming; so
that he despaired of receiving any of
the Succors he looked for time enough
except those of <hi>France.</hi> The King
on this occasion, as on a thousand
others shewed himself to be the most
Christian, and the most zealous of all
Princes for the good of Christendom;
for when <hi>Count Strozzi</hi> whom we spoke
of, who was sent from his Imperial,
to his Most Christian Majesty, had
represented the necessity the Emperor
was in, the King granted all that he
desired; and not at all satisfied that
they should limit the Succors to two
thousand Horse, and four thousand
Foot, that they should think to bound
his liberality, and hinder him from
giving more splendid marks of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51472:107"/>
generosity, and zeal for
Religion. This incomparable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
could not keep himself from
telling his Courtiers, that he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were in <hi>Hungary</hi> than at the
<hi>Louvre;</hi> and that if the Dauphin his
only Son were old enough, he would
send him to this War. The chief of
the Court, and Kingdom were ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
of serving as Volunteers under
<hi>Count Coligni,</hi> whom the King chose
to be General, making the Duke of
<hi>Feuillade</hi> his <hi>Mareschal de Camp.</hi> The
Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> great Chamberlain
of <hi>France,</hi> was the first that begg'd
leave of his Majesty to make this
<hi>Campagna,</hi> his example was followed
by his Brother the <hi>Count d' Auvergn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

themselves to signalize their

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:51472:107"/>
and by we shall see them defeating
the most formidable Enemy of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom.</p>
                     <p>The news of the Troops that were
to come to the Emperors assistance
being brought to the <hi>Grand Visier,</hi> he
resolved to advance his Conquests be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their arrival. <hi>Ismael Bassa</hi> whom
he commanded to gain the passage
over the River <hi>Mur,</hi> having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed,
as we said before by <hi>Count
Strozzi,</hi> sought a more favourable
place, and besieged the Fort of <hi>Serin,</hi>
which commanded all the Country
about it. <hi>Count Nicolas Serini</hi> did all
he could to make the Enemy retire,
and perhaps had effected it, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them to give over their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
if <hi>Achmet Coprogli,</hi> who ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
sought an opportunity of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
the glory of a victory with
this General, whose reputation was
so great, that the Turks trembled at
his very name, had not arrived in the
Camp, with the <hi>Bassa's</hi> of <hi>Bossina,</hi> and
<hi>Albania,</hi> followed by a body of twenty
thousand men, having made another
body of the rest of his Army, which
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:51472:108"/>
was employed in another place, His
presence animated the Souldiers, who
were discouraged by the stout resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of their Enemy, and the toils
they indured in the Siege. They were
ashamed not to follow their General,
who exposed himself to the greatest
dangers, and would have gone to the
assault himself, if the crowd of the
Officers of the Army had afforded
him any room. They strove who
should first take the Fort, and having
at last carried it, they put two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men whom they found there in
Garrison to the Sword, inraged that
such an handful should presume to
resist an Army of forty thousand
men. The <hi>Grand Visier</hi> caused this
Fort to be razed; the demolition of
which he had before in vain deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the Emperor, because it awed
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Garrison in <hi>Canisia.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
he marched against little
<hi>Comora,</hi> and took it by Composition;
and hearing that <hi>Count Souches</hi> one of
the Imperial Generals had defeated
the twenty thousand Tartars, Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davians,
and Valachians, whom he
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51472:108"/>
sent into the high <hi>Hungary,</hi> at <hi>Serne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi>
He determined to extend his
vengeance to the very Gates of <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
to waste all <hi>Austria,</hi> and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege
the Emperor in the Capital Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his Empire. To this purpose
he approached <hi>Sarvar</hi> a considerable
place on the River <hi>Raab;</hi> but seeing
no likelihood of forcing it suddenly,
and being informed that the imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Army advanced to hinder his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
he resolved to prevent it, and
marched in haste to possess himself of
the Bridge of <hi>Kermen,</hi> a Town on the
same River, and in his march took
the Town of <hi>Ergevart;</hi> but he met
with a vigorous resistance when he
came to the Bridge where he intended
to pass his Army. <hi>Count Montecuculi</hi>
the General of the Imperial Troops,
and <hi>Count Hohenlac,</hi> General of the
Confederates, foresaw that the <hi>Grand
Visier</hi> would choose this passage as the
most commodious, and were come
thither to make it good: but they
would have been forced to have quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it, if a party of <hi>Count Coligni,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the Auxiliary French Troops
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:51472:109"/>
Cavalry had not arrived when the
Turks were forcing the Bridge. This
General, who according to the order
he had received from the <hi>Generalissimo,</hi>
had hastned his march to joyn the
Imperial Army, advanced with some
Volunteers, and a party of his Guards,
and for almost two hours together
withstood all the fire and attempts of
the <hi>Ottomans.</hi> Then the <hi>Hungarians</hi>
who were deserted by the <hi>Germans,</hi>
seeing themselves seconded by the
<hi>French,</hi> took heart, and fell upon the
Enemy, who was forced to seek a pass
two Musket-shot lower, where the
<hi>French</hi> Horse still behaved themselves
gallantly, and drove back the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
Army, which lost there abundance of
Souldiers and Officers, and among
the rest the <hi>Bassa</hi> of <hi>Bossina,</hi> who was
slain fighting in the formost Ranks.
The <hi>Visier</hi> who would not shrink from
the resolution he had taken, impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
increasing his thirst of victory,
persisted obstinately in his design of
passing the <hi>Raab.</hi> Therefore he went
up higher towards St. <hi>Godard,</hi> a little
Village, now famous for the action
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:51472:109"/>
that happened there, whither he was
followed by the Christian Army,
which he galled with Cannon-shot all
night, while he in the mean time
held a Council of War, where it was
concluded to swim over part of the
Cavalry, and pass the rest over a
bridge, which was made under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
of the Artillery between St. <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi>
and <hi>Glostorff. Ismael Bassa</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi>
had the conduct of this enterprize, he
passed at the head of six thousand <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries</hi>
and <hi>Spahies,</hi> and the flower of
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army. The <hi>Grand Visier</hi>
commanded him to make a retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on the other side of the River,
to amuse the Christians, while he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the body of his Army in another
place, that they might charge the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialists
on both sides: but <hi>Ismael</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gotten over to the other side, in
spight of the <hi>Germans</hi> resistance,
could not withhold his Souldiers
from assaulting and defeating <hi>Count
Horlac</hi>'s Troops that disputed the Pass
with them. After which he posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himself of their post, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched
himself, after he had put
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:51472:110"/>
them to flight, taken their Cannon,
and cut off above two thousand heads.
He presently sent the <hi>Grand Visier</hi>
word that he was master of the Pass,
and that if he would advance with
the rest of the Army, he might cut
the Imperialists in pieces. Upon this
advice <hi>Achmet</hi> caused more Troops
to pass over to him, who not having
room enough to put themselves in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to fight, were attacked by the
<hi>French;</hi> and the Cavalry too being in
the same distress, were not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the onset of the illustrious <hi>French</hi>
Volunteers: so that the first Ranks
turning their backs, they were all so
disordered, that they betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to flight, and threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into the <hi>Raab,</hi> where they were
drowned in sight of the rest of their
Army, and their General, who not
being able to assist them, did all that
a great Captain could do to animate
his Souldiers, and make them renew
the Fight, that they might revenge
the defeat of their companions; but
they were seized with such a panic
fear, that they gave back instead of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:51472:110"/>
advancing. The <hi>Visier</hi> in vain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to them how much they
were concerned to repair their loss,
for they persisted in their disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
He went himself before them
with his Simitar in his hand, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them victory, and great rewards
if they would go where their honour
called them, and conjured them to
follow him; but seeing this did not
prevail, he added threats to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties,
and upbraided their base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
His fury carried him so far,
that he had like to have perished in
sight of his disobedient Army, and
not able to suppress his indignation
any longer, he killed three Officers
with his own hand, whom he in vain
called by their names to follow him,
pursuing two more, who cried out to
him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that they came to make War
on the <hi>Transylvanians</hi> and <hi>Hungarians,</hi>
and not to fight with the <hi>French.</hi> This
brave General finding there was no
remedy, caused his Troops to retreat
into a secure place, and he with his
followers only retired into a quarter
apart, to shew how he contemned his
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:51472:111"/>
own Army. He sent with a great
deal of civility to the Christian Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
to demand several Captains,
and some <hi>Bassa's,</hi> and chiefly <hi>Ismael</hi>
who perished in the Fight, which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
nine hours; offering whatever
they pleased for their ransom, if they
were Prisoners, and sent back all the
Christian prisoners that were in his
Camp. After the Battle, the two
Armies attempted nothing conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
but stood upon their guard on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
The Turkish Officers and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains
being ashamed of their disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
desired their General to let
them recover their credit by some
Siege, or any thing but engaging the
Christian Army: but the places they
proposed to besiege were of so little
importance, that he reproached their
cowardize, and flight before an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of men tired with a long journey;
and told them he would have no
more to do with Souldiers who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, and by
their baseness sullied the glory of
their Ancestors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="213" facs="tcp:51472:111"/>
After this Declaration he sent the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> word of his loss, and the
disobedience of his Troops, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
him to renew the Peace between
the two Empires, to prevent his being
exposed to a second disgrace: all the
<hi>Divan</hi> was of his opinion. The <hi>Sultan</hi>
sent him order to conclude it, and
gave notice to the Emperors Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that to stop the progress of the
War, they should renew the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
that were held at <hi>Themiswar.</hi>
The Resident immediately sent away
a Courrier to advertise Prince <hi>Lako<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wits</hi>
the President of the Emperors
Council of War, who willingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
the proposition, and nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
so secretly with the <hi>Visier
Azem,</hi> that the Peace was published
before it was thought to be treated of.</p>
                     <p>All the world was surprized at this
suddain Peace; the Imperialists were
of opinion that it was opportunely
concluded: but it is certain, that if
it had not been made so hastily, and
they had then pursued the <hi>Turks</hi> when
they were discouraged by their losses
and disorder in the Battle of S. <hi>Godard,</hi>
                        <pb n="214" facs="tcp:51472:112"/>
the rest of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Transylvania</hi>
might have been recovered, which
the <hi>Sultan</hi> without doubt would have
surrendered, to finish a War that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
the best part of his Forces,
which he wanted to oppose the <hi>Sophy,</hi>
who made new attempts on <hi>Babylon,</hi>
and the Provinces bordering on <hi>Persia,</hi>
to preserve his Conquests in <hi>Candia,</hi>
from whence the <hi>Venetians</hi> were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him; and to appease the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
which the revolt of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<hi>Chazan Bassa</hi> had raised in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All Christendom having taken
Arms to assist the Emperor, would
have made great advantages by the
continuation of the War against the
common Enemy, and particularly the
Commonwealth of <hi>Venice</hi> would have
forced him wholly to quit his design
upon <hi>Candia.</hi> There can never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
so proper a conjuncture to humble
the <hi>Sultan's</hi> pride. All the Potentates
of <hi>Europe</hi> were ready to unite against
him. His own Dominions were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
with intestine broils; the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi>
and the other Princes of <hi>Asia</hi> were
about to declare War against him.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:51472:112"/>
The <hi>Venetians</hi> had a strong Fleet at
Sea. Every thing seemed to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to his ruine. But the Emperor
by a mistaken policy took false mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
which in the consequence fell
heavy not only upon himself, but the
common interest of Christendom;
for he concluded such a Peace as left
the <hi>Sultan</hi> at liberty to assemble all
his Forces against <hi>Candia;</hi> which
proved afterward to be the loss of
that Island. Whereas, had his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Majesty comprehended the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi>
in his Treaty, it might on the
other side have turned as much to the
advantage of that Commonwealth.
This proceeding gave likewise great
offence to the most Christian King,
who had so generously assisted the
Emperor against the <hi>Ottoman</hi> power,
in the preservation of his Hereditary
Countries, which at that time his
Imperial Majesty was not of himself
in condition to defend. The <hi>French</hi>
were but ill requited for their pains,
particularly by the Confederates,
who shamefully left them as soon as
they saw them engaged with the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:51472:113"/>
                        <hi>Turks;</hi> insomuch that <hi>Count Horlac</hi>
the Confederates General, not
being able to make them stand, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
into a Wood, where he was
found after the Battle foaming with
rage, to see some of our Captains
and Volunteers covered with their
own, and their enemies blood; who
asked him what became of his
Troops, and why they would not
partake of the honour of the victory,
The generosity of our Souldiers which
deserved the acknowledgment, and
friendship of the <hi>Germans,</hi> received
so much the contrary, that they would
not allow them so much as victuals
and forrage; so that the Officers were
forced-to use threats, to get necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for the subsistance of their
Troops in their return to <hi>France,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they led them, the Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Peace leaving them no more
to do in <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Achmet Coprogli</hi> was afraid he should
have been forced to have relinquished
many of his Masters pretensions;
but seeing how easily the Emperor
was satisfied, he managed the <hi>Sultans</hi>
                        <pb n="217" facs="tcp:51472:113"/>
interest as well as he could, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
to Articles which he at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
conjuncture would never have
agreed to. He sent them presently
away to his Highness to be ratified,
and in the mean time he retreated to
<hi>Belgrade,</hi> where he dismissed the <hi>Asian</hi>
Troops, to go and Winter in their
own Country, and sent those of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
to Winter in <hi>Bossina,</hi> that they
might be the nearer to <hi>Dalmatia,</hi>
which he intended to attacque the
next Campagna.</p>
                     <p>Nothing now remain'd for him to do
but to return to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where
his friends and the people impatiently
expected him; but he would not set
forward without the <hi>Grand Signior's</hi>
order, and till he had received the
ratification of the Peace.
It was the more welcome
at <hi>Constantinople</hi> at this
time,<note place="margin">Octob. 22. 1664.</note> because it fell out
at the birth of the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Son, who
by the death of his Brother was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on as <hi>Chas Adas,</hi> which is as much
as the eldest Son, and Heir of the
Empire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="218" facs="tcp:51472:114"/>
The first Article of the Peace, was,
that the Emperors should send Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
to one another, who should
bring the Ratifications, and presents
usual on the like occasions. The
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> pitched upon <hi>Mahomet
Bassa,</hi> and sent a rich Vest by him to
the <hi>Visier Azem,</hi> whom he should find
at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> and receive the Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of his Embassie from him. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
acquitted himself faithfully of
his Highnesses Commissions, and at
the same time that <hi>Achmet</hi> received
from him the marks of his Masters
gratitude and affection, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the death of generous
<hi>Count Serini.</hi> This news so surprized
the <hi>Grand Visier,</hi> that he broke off his
conversation with <hi>Mahomet Bassa,</hi> to
learn the particulars of that sad acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
which no relation hitherto has
given a clear account of, as I find by
some secret <hi>Memoires</hi> which have
more truth in them.</p>
                     <p>It was told the <hi>Ottoman</hi> General,
that his victorious Arms having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<hi>Count Serini</hi> to raise the Siege of
<hi>Canisia,</hi> he retired into a Fort of his
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:51472:114"/>
own name, which he had built, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
dissatisfied that this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
as well as several others before
had succeeded no better for want of
necessary assistance; and that his vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
for the loss, and raising of the
said Fort, and the ill usage he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the Emperor, and the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Diet, caused him to retire into
one of his Country houses, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
himself in the tranquillity of a
private life, for the inconstancy of
his fortune, and the injustice of the
Court; where those who held the
first rank, as being the most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and considerable persons in the
Empire, not satisfied with hindering
the Diet from choosing him <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lissimo</hi>
of the Army, which command
justly belonged to him, still continued
their design of destroying him, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
their envy, and free themselves
from their apprehension that this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro
would one day shew his resentment
of their ingratitude. But not daring
to attempt his life openly, with their
Arms in their hands, their Court-trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
pursued him in the midst of the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:51472:115"/>
Forrests, where, as he was wont to
do, diverting his melancholy with
Hunting, he was killed with a blow
he received in the chase of a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
great Wild Boar, which he had
already wounded; to whose fury
the authors of his death falsly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
his murther, and accordingly
contrived the relations of it; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
so to palliate the enormity of
an action which it was their interest
should be eternally concealed.</p>
                     <p>This recital had a contrary effect
to what was reported. Generous <hi>Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
considering the hard fate of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
<hi>Count Serini,</hi> who may well be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
the greatest Hero of this Age,
far from rejoycing at the fall of so
dangerous an enemy, was so touched
at it, that all the satisfaction he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
from the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s obliging
expressions, which <hi>Mahomet Bassa</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
him of, could not keep him
from shewing his grief, and lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the unhappy end of a Captain
who had so obstructed the progress of
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Arms, to that degree,
that he was angry with the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:51472:115"/>
                        <hi>Turks</hi> for making Bonfires
when they heard of it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Grand Visier</hi> having learned
the <hi>Sultans</hi> intentions, dispatched <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet
Bassa,</hi> that he might arrive at
<hi>Vienna,</hi> at the same time that <hi>Count
Lesbley,</hi> whom the Emperor sent to the
Port, should come to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> was. Then having
commanded the <hi>Bassa's</hi> of <hi>Bossina</hi> and
<hi>Albania</hi> to have their Troops ready to
pass into <hi>Dalmatia</hi> with the <hi>Sultans</hi>
first orders, he began his journey to
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he met with the
applauses due to his great conduct,
and invincible courage. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Mahomet</hi> received him with
open arms, and sufficiently manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
his kindness for, and esteem of
this great Minister, who far from abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his favour, would have made use
of it, to obtain pardon for those Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
who disobeyed him when he
pressed them to fight, and would
hardly suffer the <hi>Sultan</hi> to put five or
six of them to death, for an example
to the rest: not but that he was as
sensible of their baseness as of the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:51472:116"/>
bravery of the <hi>French,</hi> whose courage
he commended in the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s
presence, and testified how much he
valued them, by his kind reception
of, and civility to <hi>Monsieur de la Haye,</hi>
then Embassador of <hi>France</hi> at the Port,
whom he entertained three days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in his house, treating him with
more respect than was ever shewn to
any Embassador before.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Grand Visiers</hi> return gave the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> the freedom of divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself with Hunting, and his
Women; for leaving all his affairs
to his care, which he had looked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in his absence, he retired to one
of his pleasant Country Houses,
which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Chioufti,</hi> not far
from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where <hi>Achmet Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>progli</hi>
staid to send relief to <hi>Canea,</hi>
which was still distressed by the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
and to see the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Revenues
paid, and replenish his Treasury,
which was exhausted by the Wars.
That of <hi>Candia</hi> was incredibly expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
all the Ammunition and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits
that were sent thither were lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
enough; and the innumerable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:51472:116"/>
that had been consumed in it, had
made but a very slender progress:
therefore he considered how he might
put a speedy end to it. He applied
himself diligently to put the affairs
of the Port into such a posture, as
might permit him to go thither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and the conquest of this Island
seeming to him the most glorious that
he could ever make, he promised
himself both good success in his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and immortal renown, not
only among the <hi>Turks,</hi> who knowing
the importance of the Kingdom of
<hi>Candia,</hi> obstinately contended for the
mastery of it twenty years; but also
among all other Nations, who would
admire the valour of the Defendants,
and the constancy of the Besiegers.
Nor did he doubt of effecting more
by his presence than all the Generals
that had been sent thither before had
done. His design was to finish the
War by taking the Capital City,
which he resolved to besiege with all
the vigour and pains that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from a Captain perfectly instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the art of War. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:51472:117"/>
his intentions to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and remonstrated to him that he
ought not any longer to oppose his
departure from <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The great preparations he made
were soon known to the <hi>Venetians,</hi>
who on their side disposed themselves
to resist them; but not finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
strong enough, they sent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors
to implore the assistance of
all the Christian Princes.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time all things being
ready for the <hi>Grand Visiers</hi> Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he parted from <hi>Constantinople</hi> with
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> (who for some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
you will learn hereafter, never
returned thither since) and followed
him to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and from thence to
<hi>Larissa,</hi> where he took leave of his
Highness to go to <hi>Thebes,</hi> waiting for
the union of the Troops he was to
lead. As soon as they were assembled
he caused them to march to <hi>Napoli di
Romania,</hi> which place he chose for the
general Rendevouze, and then went
to meet his Wife <hi>Iohaime,</hi> and <hi>Fatima</hi>
his Mother, who would needs accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
him in his voyage. He was
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:51472:117"/>
glad of having the advantage of her
counsel, whose wit, and courage was
above her Sex. With these two
persons who were so dear to him he
embarqued at <hi>Malvezie,</hi> and set sail
for <hi>Canea,</hi> where his arrival animated
the besieged, who were closely pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by the <hi>Venetians.</hi> At his first coming
he forced the Enemy to retire, and
after he had visited the place, took
a general review of all the Troops
that were in the Island, and those that
he brought along with him, and then
with a small party went to view the
old Town of <hi>Candia,</hi> and to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
how the former siege was dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
The <hi>Venetians</hi> being advertised
of his approach, sallied out, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed
him; but his design being to
end this tedious, expensive War, by
taking the chief City, he soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
with a more considerable body
of men, that he might with more
safety view the Country, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
of the place, about which he
pitched a new Camp, and drew lines
for a more regular Siege than the
former; the execution of which he
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:51472:118"/>
found very difficult; for not having
been truly informed of the Forces of
the Town, and the situation of the
Country. He saw it would cost him
more pains, and time, than he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
it would. However not at al
discouraged by the difficulties he met
with, he carried on the works with
such diligence, that the besieged
were quickly reduced to employ all
the industry of their Engineers to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them from the Mines which he
continually sprung, and all the
strength of their Souldiers to resist the
assaults of the <hi>Turks.</hi> Never was any
place so vigorously attaqued, and so
stoutly defended. This being one of
the most famous Sieges that ever was,
several Writers have at large related
it; therefore I shall not trouble the
Reader with an useless repetition of
what he may find elsewhere, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
succinctly mention what the story
of the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> will not suffer me
to omit, without specifying all the
assaults and skirmishes that happened
at it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="227" facs="tcp:51472:118"/>
This General, besides the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
resistance of the besieged, had no
less dangerous enemies to encounter
with at this Port, who did him all
the ill offices they could with the
<hi>Grand Signior,</hi> and by making use of
this troublesome conjuncture of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
endeavoured to destroy him.
They represented to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> that
the length of the Siege of <hi>Candia</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the <hi>Grand Visiers</hi> want
of courage, whose Army was power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
enough to subdue all <hi>Asia,</hi> or the
greatest Empire in the world; but
that his cowardize made him protract
the time, that the Christians might
have leisure to assemble their Forces,
which would at last oblige the <hi>Ottoman</hi>
Army to quit the conquest of an
Island that had exhausted the strength
of the Empire, and his Highnesses
Treasures: that such an affront
would be irreparable, and an eternal
disgrace to the <hi>Musulmans,</hi> and would
certainly happen through the base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and weakness of the <hi>Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier,</hi>
who out of a vain presumption
had undertaken the continuation of a
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:51472:119"/>
War he could never end honourably.
Thus these envious persons omitted
nothing that might induce the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> to recal and ruine him.</p>
                     <p>The too credulous Prince provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
by the <hi>Grand Visiers</hi> ill success,
who incessantly sent for Recruits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
all that was said against him;
and without any regard to his invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
fidelity, or the high rank he
held in the Empire, which made him
subject to the malice of the Courtiers,
without considering that those Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
who are most affectionate to, and
zealous for the services of their
Prince, and the good of the State,
are always most exposed to envy. He
took a resolution which would have
deprived him of the ablest, and best
of all his Subjects, if <hi>Achmet Coprogli</hi>'s
prudence had not equalled the <hi>Sultans</hi>
cruelty, and injustice. He sent this
brave General word that he should
suddenly put an end to the Siege,
which his rashness had prompted him
to undertake, and in a very short
time either send him his Head, or the
Keys of <hi>Candia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="229" facs="tcp:51472:119"/>
This order was very peremptory, and
sufficient to have shaken the firmest
Courage. The <hi>Grand Visier</hi> had great
reason to think himself very rigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
and unjustly dealt with; his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
and zeal for his Master, and
the hazards his life was so often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to for his glory, deserved bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
usage, and might have inclined
him to revenge himself, and shew his
resentment by abandoning his Army,
which would undoubtedly have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished,
if he had sought to secure
himself by going over to the <hi>Venetian</hi>
side, as he might have done: but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
having ever been his only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
he never so much as entertained
a thought that was prejudicial to his
reputation. He answered the <hi>Sultan</hi>
very submissively, yet in such terms
as shewed the greatness of his soul;
and that it was not the fear of death
he was threatned with that made him
hasten a conquest, which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
for the augmentation of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
and glory: that he never
had any other end in it, and that if
his Highness could reap any benefit
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:51472:120"/>
by his death, it was in his power to
satisfie himself when he pleased:
that as to the Siege of <hi>Candia</hi> he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to finish it, if he would allow
him time, having been deceived by a
false account of the state of the place.
<hi>Achmet</hi> imparted the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi>
command to his Mother <hi>Fatima,</hi> and
having consulted together, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that this blow proceeded from
the persecutions of his enemies at
Court: and soon after they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in their opinion by the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers
which they sent continually to
the Port, to bring them news of all
that passed there. They found that
some Courtiers who had insinuated
themselves into the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
had attempted to disgrace him,
and had succeeded in it. However
he did not much trouble himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
assured that his conduct would ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
him, and that the detractors
would be punished for their calumnies
by their own remorse, and the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi>
anger, who would in time disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their treachery. He continued
to press the besieged, who received
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:51472:120"/>
great assistance from the King of
<hi>France,</hi> under the conduct of the
<hi>Count de la Feuillade,</hi> who was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
by the <hi>Count de St. Paul,</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Chasteau Thierry,</hi> the <hi>Sieurs
de Caderousse, de Villemaur,</hi> and many
more Gentlemen and Officers, who
came to shew the <hi>Turks</hi> that they
could overcome them as well in <hi>Creet</hi>
as in <hi>Hungary.</hi> And the sallies of
these brave men put the <hi>Turks</hi> almost
in despair, who were incouraged by
their Generals presence. He went
from quarter to quarter to animate
them, and exhort them to do their
duty. He caused new <hi>Candia</hi> which
the <hi>Turks</hi> built after the taking of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea</hi>
to be demolished, that he might
make use of the materials in his
works, and by depriving his Troops
of a safe retreat, force them to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
themselves by their valour, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
telling them that they must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conquer or die.</p>
                     <p>But while he endeavours to become
master of <hi>Candia, Constantinople</hi> was
filled with tumults raised by the
male-contents of the Empire, who
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:51472:121"/>
seeing the ill success of the <hi>Grand
Signiors</hi> Arms in this Island, and that
several neighbouring Princes were
ready to declare War against him,
resolved to make use of this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to revenge his Highnesses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of them, and prevent the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
that was due to their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion;
in which they engaged the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries,</hi>
who remained at <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
to guard the Town, the <hi>Sultan,</hi>
and the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> The Mutineers
threatned to depose the Emperor,
and to set up Prince <hi>Soliman</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his room. The absence of the
<hi>Visier Azem</hi> strengthened this Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which all the <hi>Sultan Valide</hi>'s pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
could hardly appease. The <hi>Sultan</hi>
was then at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and was so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with the Inhabitants of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi>
that he would not so much
as take notice of their earnest solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of him to return thither. He
declared openly that this proud City
should no longer be the Imperial Seat,
since she had rendered her self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
by her frequent disorders.
The people, and the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> who
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:51472:121"/>
for the most part have their Families
at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> were extremely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
by this reproach. And if
Prince <hi>Soliman</hi> had been among them,
they had certainly proclaimed him
Emperor: but he was in the <hi>Grand
Signiors</hi> power, who not being so bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
as his Predecessors, would
not practise their inhumane policy of
securing the possession of the Empire
by the death of all their Brothers.
Far from being so cruelly cautious he
allowed his three Brothers an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
freedom, and suffered them to
employ themselves in exercises agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to their high birth: yet when
he went from <hi>Constantinople</hi> he took
<hi>Soliman</hi> along with him.</p>
                     <p>This Princes Mother <hi>Maiama</hi> was
dead, she did all she could to place
him on the Throne; which is partly
the cause that the <hi>Sultan</hi> is jealous of
him. His good qualities render him
beloved by all the world, especially
by the Souldiers, who are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of his vast courage. His impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
to give some proofs of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
made him inconsiderately desire
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:51472:122"/>
his Brother to let him accompany the
<hi>Grand Visier</hi> in the <hi>Candian</hi> War, which
his Highness thought not fit to grant;
and the <hi>Visier Azem</hi> convinced the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
that it concerned him not to trust
this young Prince with Arms, which
he might one day turn against him,
but to keep him where his actions
might be better observed: not that
he gave him this advice to exasperate
him against his Brother, but he knew
the Souldiers inclination to <hi>Soliman,</hi>
who was of an active, undertaking
spirit, and capable of raising great
troubles in the State, if he should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the example of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
endeavour to free himself, and
affect the Empire. <hi>Mahomet</hi> who had
never seriously made these reflections,
and did not at all distrust <hi>Soliman,</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him to live at liberty; but the
young Princes imprudence, in repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at his Brothers refusal, opened
the <hi>Sultans</hi> eyes, and made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reflect
on what the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to him. The Sedition that
happened afterwards at <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
caused him to watch <hi>Soliman</hi>'s beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
more narrowly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="235" facs="tcp:51472:122"/>
In the mean time Prince <hi>Soliman</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusted
nothing, Ambition was not
his predominate passion, he loved
hunting as well as the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi>
always following him to that sport,
and sometimes he went alone. But
this exercise did not so take him up,
but that he was well enough pleased
with another, which is the usual em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of people of his age. His
Brother was the most amorous Prince
in the world, nor was he less inclined
to gallantry himself; but he loved to
keep it secret, not affecting to make
a noise with his pleasures. He long
sought for an object worthy of his
kindness; and at last <hi>Zizim Morat
Bassa</hi> by an extraordinary adventure
furnished him with such an one as he
desired. The <hi>Sangiac</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> who
was akin to this <hi>Bassa,</hi> had sent him
a very pretty Slave, which he bought
of a <hi>Corsair Tartar,</hi> and brought up
with a great deal of care, to make a
Present of her to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi>
according to the custom of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
of Provinces, and Cities, who
by this means, acquire, and preserve
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:51472:123"/>
his Highnesses favour. The <hi>Sangiac
Sinan</hi> who looked on <hi>Zizim Morat</hi>
as his Patron at the Port, desired him
to present her to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> who was
then at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where he intended
to establish the Seat of the Empire,
as <hi>Soliman</hi> the first of that name sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
the <hi>Magnificent</hi> had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
The <hi>Bassa</hi> deferred the acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himself of <hi>Sinan</hi>'s Commission
till the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> return to <hi>Larissa,</hi>
where he spends most part of the year,
as well for the beauty of the place,
which is the finest in all <hi>Thessaly,</hi> as
for the convenience of Hunting in
the great Forrests about it. He was
an intimate friend of Prince <hi>Soliman,</hi>
who a few days after came thither
with his Brother. <hi>Zizim Morat</hi> told
him he had a Present to make to his
Highness, which would without
doubt be well received; but that it
must be kept secret, lest the <hi>Grand
Sultana</hi> should come to hear of it, who
would hate him mortally if he should
know that he preferred a new Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
to the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> then he
described the young womans beauty
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:51472:123"/>
to him, which made <hi>Soliman</hi> desirous
to see her, before she was delivered
to the Emperor his Brother. The <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>
not dreaming of what would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
carried him home with him, and
shewed him the fair Slave, with whom
he fell desperately in love. He made
no secret of it to <hi>Zizim,</hi> but told him
with a great deal of joy, that she was
absolute mistriss of his heart, and
conjured him to give him a proof of
his friendship, by letting him have the
young Slave. The <hi>Bassa</hi> used strong
arguments to the contrary, and told
him that he could not betray the trust
the <hi>Sangiac</hi> of <hi>Smyrna</hi> reposed in him,
without being at the same time
false to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> who would
punish them both if he came to know
it. But amorous <hi>Soliman</hi> answered
his arguments with so much force,
and eloquence, convincing him, that
it might be easily kept secret, since
the <hi>Sultan</hi> was ignorant of it, and the
absent <hi>Sangiac</hi> could never discover it,
that at last friendship surmounted all
other considerations, and he granted
his request. <hi>Soliman</hi> embraced him a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:51472:124"/>
thousand times, and having expressed
how much he was obliged to him,
they contrived how they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
this Beauty from the <hi>Sultan,</hi> that
he might not find out <hi>Soliman</hi>'s trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and <hi>Morat</hi>'s falshood. They could
think of no better way than to keep
her in a Country house which <hi>Zizim</hi>
had in the pleasant Valley of <hi>Ianica,</hi>
heretofore the delicious <hi>Tempe,</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by the famous River <hi>Peneus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Mountains of <hi>Ossa</hi> and
<hi>Olympus.</hi> In that Country there is a
Forrest, the same that <hi>Virgil</hi> speaks of,
where the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> often hunts,
and <hi>Soliman</hi> with him, who then vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits
the fair <hi>Zulemai,</hi> without being
taken notice of. This lasted some
time, during which <hi>Soliman</hi>'s life was
as happy as <hi>Zulemai</hi> could make it,
who loved him, and wanted no
charms to engage him. She was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
well shaped; her complexion
was so bright that it dazled those
who beheld it, her hair was brown,
her eyes black, and full, her mouth
little, her lips juycy, her teeth white,
and well set: she had a sweetness in
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:51472:124"/>
her chin, and the midst of her cheeks
that became her wonderfully when
she spoke. Her neck was well shaped,
as also her arms and hands; her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
was noble, her speech pleasing,
and her humor the best in the world.
<hi>Soliman</hi> was tall, and strait; his face
round, his complexion smooth, and
white; his forehead large, and high,
his eyes blue, and smiling, his nose a
little aquiline, his mouth pretty, his
<hi>min</hi> great, his humor magnificent, and
his nature very generous. His incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
are like the <hi>Grand Signiors,</hi>
but he is a little more impatient and
quick. His soul is noble, and extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grateful, and his temper so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placent,
that he easily gains the
friendship of all men.</p>
                     <p>These two Lovers freely enjoyed the
pleasures of mutual love, but one day
chance brought the <hi>Sultan</hi> to <hi>Zizim
Morat</hi>'s Country house, where the
Prince was abroad hunting in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.
The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> being thirsty,
came alone to this house to refresh
himself, and there seeing the <hi>Bostangi</hi>'s
or Gardeners Daughter, he liked her
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:51472:125"/>
very well. The good man presently
found who he was, and told his Wife
<hi>Zabra</hi> of it. They were both over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
to see that their daughter plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and commanded her
to use all her art to engage him,
and deserve his favour, their good
fortune depending upon it. They
endeavoured to conceal <hi>Zulemai</hi> from
the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> fearing her beauty
would eclipse <hi>Abdimai</hi>'s, with whom
he was so well pleased, that he desired
them to take care of her, and let no
body else see her, promising to come
and visit her often. The good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
joy appeared in their blessing of
<hi>Mahomet,</hi> and throwing themselves
at his feet, they gave him thanks for
the honour he did their Daughter,
who they hoped would bring forth a
Prince, that should be the support,
and strength of the <hi>Musulmans,</hi> and
should spread the Law of their
Prophet over all the earth. When
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> was gone, they char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<hi>Abdima</hi> not to tell any body
what had happened, and to take heed
of letting the <hi>Sultan</hi> know when she
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:51472:125"/>
saw him, that <hi>Zulemai</hi> was in their
house. <hi>Abdima</hi> who had no less wit
than beauty, obey'd their commands,
being convinced how much it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
her to do so. In the mean time
Prince <hi>Soliman</hi> continued his visits,
and the Emperor his; but it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for them both to go so often to
the same place without meeting there
at last. <hi>Mahomet</hi> has ever had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
esteem for the <hi>Grand Sultana Zachi</hi>
than usually the <hi>Sultans</hi> have for their
Wives, and avoids doing any thing
that may make her jealous, who loves
him so tenderly, that she follows him
where ever he goes, and seldom
leaves him but when she lies in.
Therefore he was glad of having a
Mistress whom the <hi>Sultana</hi> could not
find out, and whom he might visit
under pretence of hunting. This was
the reason that kept him from remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Abdima</hi> from <hi>Zizim Morats</hi> house;
but the <hi>Sultana Zachi</hi> who often went
hunting with the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that he always lost himself in the
Forrest, she believed he had some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
in his wandering, and caused a
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:51472:126"/>
slave to go after him afar off: by
which means she learnt that he went
into a house on the edge of a Wood,
whither she fail'd not to follow him
the next time she saw him go that
way. Prince <hi>Soliman</hi> was got thither
before the Emperor, and was already
with the charming <hi>Zulemai,</hi> when the
<hi>Bostangi</hi> of the house seeing the <hi>Sultan</hi>
at the gate, made all the haste he
could to hide them. The <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi>
was no sooner entered into the
Chamber where he was wont to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
himself with the fair <hi>Abdima,</hi>
but he was informed of the <hi>Grand
Sultana's</hi> arrival<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> He presently ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
that she had followed him to
surprize him, and therefore he thought
of hiding <hi>Abdima</hi> from her, that she
might not be exposed to her jealousie.
To this purpose he would have open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Closet where his Brother <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
and <hi>Zulemai</hi> were: but old <hi>Zabra</hi>
apprehending he might like <hi>Zulemai</hi>
better than her Daughter, offered to
dispose of her in a more secret place.
<hi>Mahomet</hi> on the other side fearing the
<hi>Sultanas</hi> sudden coming would prevent
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:51472:126"/>
them, would not let <hi>Abdima</hi> go out
of the room, and commanded her
Mother to open the Closet. Prince
<hi>Soliman</hi> hearing the Emperors voice,
believed his love was discovered, but
thinking he might do his Mistress
some harm in the first transports of
his fury, he endeavoured to keep the
door fast, by putting his Dagger into
the lock. The <hi>Sultan</hi> observing <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra's</hi>
delay, snatched the key from
her; and not being able to undo the
lock, broke open the door. The first
thing he saw was his Brother <hi>Soliman,</hi>
with a Dagger in his hand, which so
surprized him, that he never minded
<hi>Zulemai,</hi> who was behind him. At
first he fancied that <hi>Soliman</hi> courted
the Gardeners Daughter, and had hid
himself in that place with a design to
murder him, as was probable by the
posture he found him in. Rage min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with jealousie, and fear present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seized on his soul, and made him
draw his Scimitar to have killed
Prince <hi>Soliman,</hi> who could not have
avoided the mortal blow, if the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi>
had not come into the room, and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:51472:127"/>
laid hold on <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s arm, who was
no less astonished to feel his arm held
back, than to hear <hi>Zulemai</hi> shreek,
when she saw the danger her lover was
in. The <hi>Sultana Zachi</hi> having disar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> soon guessed
why he would have killed his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
when she beheld <hi>Zulemai,</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her to be the cause of his losing
his way so often in the Forrest; and
that having found <hi>Soliman</hi> courting
his Mistress, he would have slain him.
She took his astonishment at the sight
of <hi>Zulemai</hi> to be affected, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to punish her for being the cause
of such disorder; but the <hi>Sultan</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
her meaning, after he had
commanded <hi>Soliman</hi> to be seized on,
protested he had never seen her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and to justifie what he said,
sent for the Gardener, who without
mentioning the intrigue between the
Emperor, and his Daughter, who was
opportunely hid, related the story of
<hi>Zulemai,</hi> and <hi>Soliman,</hi> who confirmed
it, and discovered the other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of his adventure to the <hi>Sultana.</hi>
She easily believed the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi>
                        <pb n="245" facs="tcp:51472:127"/>
who assured her, that finding himself
thirsty as he was hunting, he came
thither to refresh himself with the
water of an excellent Fountain in the
Garden, that while they fetched him
some water, he went into that room,
and hearing a noise in the closet, his
curiosity made him open it, where he
found <hi>Soliman</hi> with a Dagger in his
hand, just coming out to murder him;
which he was endeavouring to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
when she held back his arm.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sultana</hi> being satisfied with this
Relation, never suspected <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s
fidelity, but requested him to pardon
his Brother, and accept of his justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
as she had of his.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> was so displeased
at his Brothers falshood in depriving
him of this beautiful Slave that with
great difficulty he promised the <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
not to resent it, and gave him leave
to live in the <hi>Seraglio</hi> at <hi>Constantinople</hi>
with his Mistress, whose removal from
his Highnesses sight was no little sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to <hi>Zachi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Soliman</hi>'s confinement to the old
<hi>Seraglio,</hi> which is the usual Prison of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:51472:128"/>
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes that come not to
reign, was rendered less insupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by the company of his beloved
<hi>Zulemai:</hi> but his disgrace had like to
have caused great disorders. It was
reported that the <hi>Sultan</hi> would have
killed him with his own hand, at
which the Town of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and
the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> who love <hi>Soliman,</hi> were
extremely alarmed: They knew not
the particulars of the adventure, and
told the story much to the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors</hi>
disadvantage, with whom they
were dissatisfied. They accused him
of cruelty, and as they are wont to
do, took hold of this occasion to raise
a Sedition, under pretence of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the lives of the <hi>Sultans</hi> Brothers,
whom they required to be delivered
into their hands. The <hi>Sultana Valide</hi>
who by experience knew the danger
of those tumults, thought the best
way to appease the Mutineers, was to
go to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where she hoped to
have some influence on the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
and the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> who have
ever been very respectful to her. This
Princess was somewhat dissatisfied
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:51472:128"/>
with her Sons carriage towards her,
who slighted her advice, and repined
to see her continue in that authority
which she had exercised since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his Reign. Besides, the
<hi>Grand Sultana</hi> looked enviously upon
her, and could not endure she should
be more absolute than her self. The
<hi>Sultana Valide</hi> who always loved her
Son extremely, was glad of an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of doing him a considerable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and of absenting her self from
the Port. Therefore she parted from
<hi>Adrianople</hi> with a train suitable to her
quality, and made a magnificent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
into <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where she en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to quiet the people, and
the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> and to divert them
from requiring the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to be delivered to them, fearing
they would make Prince <hi>Soliman,</hi> for
whom they had a particular kindness,
Emperor; she promised them that no
violence should be offered to the
young Princes, and protested she
would sooner die her self, than suffer
any attempt to be made on their
lives. In order to which she not only
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:51472:129"/>
took them into her protection, but
assured them she would not stir out of
the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> till the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> came
back to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and the Souldiers desired he
would make his constant abode: but
the <hi>Sultan</hi> would not hearken to his
Mothers solicitations, persisting in
his resolution of not returning thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any more, in which he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
by being informed that the
<hi>Grand Visier</hi> fomented the Sedition of
the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> in that City, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
them to place Prince <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
on the Throne. These Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
were affirmed with so many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
that how good an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
soever his Highness ought to
have had of his first Ministers fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he could not choose but believe
them: yet to have a convincing proof
of the Treason he was accused of,
and to put his obedience to the utmost
trial, he ordered him to send him the
Seal of the Empire, which he had
need of, and to bring back the rest of
the Troops as soon as he could. The
disorder at <hi>Constantinople</hi> increasing
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:51472:129"/>
every day, enraged him so much,
that in the heighth of his anger he
repented of his past credulity, and
clemency; and to take away all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of revolt, sent an express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to the <hi>Sultana Valide</hi> to strangle
his Brothers: but this order being
discovered to the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
spread over all the Town,
where the people joyned with the
Souldiers to besiege the <hi>Seraglio;</hi>
threatning the <hi>Sultana</hi> terribly if she
executed the <hi>Grand Signiors</hi> command.</p>
                     <p>This wise Princess had much ado
to appease them by letting them see
<hi>Soliman, Bajazet,</hi> and <hi>Orchanes,</hi> and
shewed themselves very sensible of
her kindness to them; especially <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liman,</hi>
who still respects her as much
as if she were his own Mother; and
not without reason, for she has sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his life twice. She abhorred her
Sons inhumanity, and sent him word,
that her affection to him, and care of
his preservation and glory, kept her
from obeying his orders, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ince it was
certain, that if she should put his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to death, the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> would
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:51472:130"/>
endeavour to revenge their murthers
on his own person. She put him in
mind of his Father <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and his
other Ancestors, who perished in the
Factions of the Militia, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and conjured him not to occasion
his own ruine by that of his Brothers,
whom she desired him to look upon as
innocent, and not to think that the
honour they had to be allied to him
rendred them criminal, or engaged
them in any seditious tumults. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
she upbraided him severely for
his cruelty, which was so contrary to
the education she had given him, and
that good nature which had hitherto
made him detest the barbarous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims
of his Predecessors.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the <hi>Grand Visier</hi>

that the <hi>Selictar</hi> his Favourite had, to

this injurious order. He was no more

which he received before; and only
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:51472:130"/>
let the <hi>Sultan</hi> know by <hi>Iacup Bassa,</hi> that
he had still fifty thousand men left to
finish his Expedition; and that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood

whom the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:51472:131"/>
in the command of the <hi>Venetian</hi>
Infantry.</p>
                     <p>The Duke of <hi>Navailles,</hi> who was
General of the Army, had no sooner
landed his men, but he gave order to
attack the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> in his Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
he was followed by the Duke
of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> and his Nephew the
<hi>Chevalier de Vendosme,</hi> who at the head
of a great many Officers, and illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Volunteers, marched in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to charge the Enemies, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to resist them as vigorously, as
they had before defended themselves
from the attempts of <hi>Monsieur de la
Feuillade:</hi> but the <hi>Turks</hi> found this
last encounter much more violent
than the former. They could not
withstand the Kings Musqueteers,
commanded by <hi>Monsieur Colbert de
Maulevrier,</hi> and the <hi>Count de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brun,</hi>
with the rest of the <hi>French</hi>
Troops; and they began to give
ground, when the <hi>Grand Visier</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
their disorder, went from
rank to rank, encouraging them to
continue the Combat, which they
were ready to have quitted. On the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:51472:131"/>
other side the Duke of <hi>Navailles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
himself like a great Captain,
and an experienced General. The
Admiral the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himself to the greatest dangers,
without any care of his person. The
<hi>Chevalier de Vendosme,</hi> though not
above fourteen years old, signalized
his courage in the formost ranks.
The Duke of <hi>Chasleau Thierry</hi> did
wonders at the head of his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and his Brother the <hi>Chevalier
de Bouillon</hi> following his example, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a bruise in his Belly, which
forced him to leave the Fight. These
brave men, and the rest of the Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers
animated the Souldiers to fight
like Lions; insomuch that the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
General seeing his men yield to
the <hi>French,</hi> who advanced to drive
the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> from their Post, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Mines to be sprung, which he
had made to stop the progress of the
Christian Army. The horrid noise
and fire which rose all at once in the
midst of the <hi>French</hi> Troops, surprised
and scattered them. Their General,
and the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> did all they
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:51472:132"/>
could to rally them; but not being
seconded as they were promised by
the Town, they were oppressed with
numbers, and forced to retreat, and
reimbarque after the death of the
Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> who had perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
all that could be expected from
a Hero. Many Officers and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of Quality perished in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
but none was so deplored
as this great man.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Grand Visier</hi> seeing these dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
enemies retreat, doubted not
but that the besieged, who wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
on the <hi>French</hi> Succors, were
infinitely discouraged. He chose out
ten thousand of his best Souldiers to
make an assault at noon-day, and to
let the <hi>Venetians</hi> see that he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
informed of the condition of
the Town. He spoke so resolutely
to his men, and promised them suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
with so much confidence, that
they behaved themselves at this time
more couragiously than ever: but
they were entertained so warmly by
the Christians, and so bravely repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that their General interpreted
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:51472:132"/>
their vigorous defence to be the effect
of the gallantry of those <hi>French</hi> who
staid to see the event of the Siege,
and to hold the place to the very last.
However he renewed his assaults so
often, and the Forces of the besieged
diminished so fast, that the <hi>Generalis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simo
Morosini,</hi> seeing there was no
probability of preserving the City,
was constrained to capitulate, and
surrender on very advantagious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
considering the miserable
state the Town was reduced to.</p>
                     <p>It was agreed on that the City,
and all the Island of <hi>Candia</hi> should be
delivered to the <hi>Visier Azem;</hi> that
the principal Forts, together with
the little adjacent Islands, which
were in the <hi>Venetians</hi> possession, and
all their other Islands in the <hi>Archipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lago,</hi>
and the other Seas, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the Commonwealths power:
that they should keep the Fort of
<hi>Clissa,</hi> and the other places they had
conquered in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and <hi>Albania:</hi>
that neither party should be obliged
to give the other any sum of money,
upon any private pretence or title
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:51472:133"/>
whatever: that the <hi>Generalissimo</hi> of
the <hi>Venetian</hi> Troops might carry from
thence three hundred pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
with all the warlike Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Provisions that were there:
that the Souldiers should march out
with their Arms, and Baggage: that
the Inhabitants who would not stay
there might go whither they pleased
with their Families, and Goods:
that the Christians might take with
them all the Reliques, and other
things that belonged to the Church:
that all Prisoners should be freed on
both sides: and that there should be
an inviolable Peace between the two
Nations.</p>
                     <p>All these Articles being drawn up,
were presented to the <hi>Grand Visier,</hi>
who presently signed them, though
they were somewhat too advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for a place that could hold out no
longer; but he had urgent reasons
that obliged him to grant these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
and to hasten the conclusion
of a Peace. He had news from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>
that the troubles continued
there, which he fear'd would be very
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:51472:133"/>
prejudicial to the State, and the
<hi>Grand Signior:</hi> besides, he apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that the fresh Succors which the
King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Pope were
sending under the Conduct of the
<hi>Mareschal de Bellefonds,</hi> might retard
the taking of <hi>Candia,</hi> which would
be more inconvenient to him than all
the favourable clauses that he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Christians. Therefore he
received the Keys of the place with
great satisfaction, and gave him that
brought them a Purse full of <hi>Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nines,</hi>
and sent rich Presents to the
<hi>Venetian</hi> General; who not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind-hand
with him in Magnificence,
sent him an handsom service of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian
Glasses, and several other cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
things, which the <hi>Grand Visier</hi>
received very civilly, and gave a
considerable sum of mony to those
who brought them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> being retired, he
made his entry into <hi>Candia,</hi> whither
the principal Officers of his Army
came to complement him: he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them with a great deal of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty.
<q>
                           <pb n="258" facs="tcp:51472:134"/>
I expect not, said he to them,
any rejoycing or extraordinary
pomp here in a place that has cost
us so dear, over whose ruines we
ought rather to weep.</q> His astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
increased at every step he made
in the Town; and the desolation
he met with every where augmented
his good opinion of the Christians,
who had so valiantly defended the
City so long after it was in so wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
a condition. After this he
bountifully rewarded his Souldiers,
and dispatched a Courrier to <hi>Adriano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
to give the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> notice
of the taking of <hi>Candia;</hi> and to let
him know that he was now ready to
give proofs of his Fidelity which had
been suspected; and that in a short
time he would be at <hi>Constantinople</hi>
with fifty thousand well disciplin'd
men, to reduce and punish those who
had slighted his Highness, and had
made use of his absence, to mutiny,
and disturb the Empire. This unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
news was exceeding welcome
to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> who lived in
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:51472:134"/>
strange apprehension of the tumults
which daily increased at <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
He thought he could never
enough commend his first Minister,
whom he fully absolved, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the ill impressions of his
enemies; declaring openly, that
<hi>Achmet Coprogli</hi> was the prop of the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire; and that none but
he was capable of such brave Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
or could have so happily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a Siege that had lasted five and
twenty years. He sent him the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of the Articles of Peace,
with a rich Cimarr embroidered with
Gold, and a Scimitar; the Handle,
Guard, and Scabbard of which were
set with Diamonds, and Stones of
inestimable value; withal assuring
him that he would receive the <hi>Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
Molino</hi> kindly, whom the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
designed to send to him with
Presents for himself, the <hi>Sultana Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide,</hi>
the Great <hi>Sultana,</hi> and the chief
of the Port. He likewise gave him
notice that he had nominated Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
to go into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:51472:135"/>
other places where their presence
would be necessary to regulate the
bounds of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Territories,
and to remove all difficulties that
might hinder the conclusion of a firm
and lasting Peace.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Visier Azem</hi> having procured
this Peace, omitted nothing that
might establish it, and punctually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
all that he promised. He was
so careful not to violate the Treaty
with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and to shew the
sincerity of his intentions, that he
caused some <hi>Turks</hi> to be impaled for
abusing the Christians at <hi>Sud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his Proclamation, that they
should do them no wrong upon pain
of death; and treated the Prisoners
that were in his Army very civilly,
and set them at liberty, after he had
given them several marks of his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity.</p>
                     <p>When he had ordered all things
necessary for the conservation of the
Island of <hi>Candia,</hi> he prepared to march
with the rest of his Troops to <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
where the news of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:51472:135"/>
and design to chastise the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers,
quickly calmed the Sedition;
and those who had been most active
in it, provided for their safety by
flight; which obliged the <hi>Sultan,</hi>
who might perhaps apprehend the
<hi>Visiers</hi> approach with so powerful an
Army, to order him to send forty
thousand men towards <hi>Mecha,</hi> and
<hi>Medina,</hi> to punish the incendiaries
that were retreated thither, that they
might disturb the remotest Provinces
of the Empire, where they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away the rich Offerings which
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> sent to <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s
Temple; and had slain the Officers,
and <hi>Ianizaries</hi> that carried them.
<hi>Achmet Coprogli</hi> obeyed the <hi>Sultans</hi>
commands so exactly, that the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals
soon received the punishment
they deserved, and yet marched on to
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> where the Sedition was
not so well laid, but that there was
still a secret Faction among the <hi>Iani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries,</hi>
against his Highness, and the
<hi>Grand Visier.</hi> The Emperor adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him of it, that he might hasten
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:51472:136"/>
his march to that City, when his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
was absolutely necessary. When
he arrived there, he was of opinion
that the surest way to put an end to
the Tumults, was, to remove the
Garrison which corresponded with
the people, to appoint new Troops to
guard the Town, and the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and
to employ the others at a distance,
where they might not be able to plot
against his own, and the <hi>Sultans</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
But before he would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
a new War, he advised the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> to maintain a good understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
between himself and those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
who might oppose his designs.
From thence he took occasion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the extraordinary valour of the
<hi>French,</hi> assuring him that they only
had retarded the taking of <hi>Candia,</hi> as
they had before stayed the progress of
his Arms in <hi>Hungary;</hi> and inflamed
him with a desire of con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>racting an
alliance with the King of <hi>France,</hi> and
sending an Embassador to him to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
his friendship. The <hi>Sultan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
convinced of his Ministers expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:51472:136"/>
and judgment, agreed to his
proposition, and resolved to follow
his counsel; and not long after dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
<hi>Soliman Mutafaraca</hi> into
<hi>France,</hi> where he was magnificently
received, and was incredibly surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
when he beheld the Majesty and
Greatness of the incomparable <hi>French</hi>
Monarch, to whom he presented a
Letter stuffed with the most splendid
Titles that ever any <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
had given to another Potentate.
This Embassador staid some time at
<hi>Paris,</hi> and after he had admired the
Politeness and Glory of the <hi>French,</hi>
he returned laden with rich Presents
to give <hi>Sultan Mahomet,</hi> and the <hi>Grand
Visier</hi> an account of his Embassie.</p>
                     <p>This great Minister perceiving that
Peace rendered the <hi>Ianizaries</hi> and <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hies</hi>
every day more insolent, like a
good Pilot, apprehended a tempest in
the midst of a calm, and was consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
how he might remove them
from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> when the troubles
of <hi>Poland</hi> furnished him with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="264" facs="tcp:51472:137"/>
This Kingdom was disturbed by
the Factions of some private men,
who sought to settle their own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
during the vacancy of the
Throne, by the voluntary abdication
of King <hi>Cazimir,</hi> who being tired
with the cares that attend Royalty,
put it into his Subjects power to elect
another King. Several Princes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be chosen, but none so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
as the great Duke of <hi>Moscovy,</hi>
who had a mind to place this Crown
on his Sons head. The Succors which
he had assisted the <hi>Polanders</hi> with to
repulse the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who broke into
their Territories with a vast Army,
seemed to countenance his pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
He fancied that the under hand
dealings of <hi>Dorosensko,</hi> the General of
the <hi>Cossacks,</hi> would gain him all the
voices of the States; but the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Prince <hi>Michel Wicloveski</hi> convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him that the Faction of <hi>Sobieski</hi>
Great Mareschal of <hi>Poland,</hi> was the
most powerful, as tending to the good
of the Kingdom: wherefore finding
his expectations frustrated, he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:51472:137"/>
the <hi>Polish</hi> Interest, thereby mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing
that his own ends had obliged
him to embrace their Party, more
than the alliance between them: but
he was not the only man that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of his hopes: <hi>Dorosensko</hi> was
so concerned, and took the Great
Dukes part so far, that he could not
conceal his resentment. He was one
of the most powerful, and ambitious
men in the Kingdom, and could not
endure to see <hi>Sobieski</hi> made <hi>Grand
Mareschal.</hi> His jealousie made him
seek all means to lessen his Rivals
authority, opposing whatsoever he
undertook; and <hi>Sobieski</hi>'s siding with
the Nobility, whom their own, and
Countries interest permitted not to
choose the Prince of <hi>Moscovy,</hi> was
sufficient ground for <hi>Dorosensko</hi> to
form a contrary Faction, and to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the Great Dukes design by gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> many voices for him as he
could: but finding this project did
not succeed, and that the new King
cherished the vertue and merit of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bieski,</hi>
whom he looked on as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:51472:138"/>
obstacle to his ambitious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses;
and besides, perceiving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
suspected to be an enemy to the
State, and fearing he should be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
as a disturber of the publick
Peace. He resolved to secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by Rebellion, and to raise his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
by betraying his King and
Country. In order to this he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to gain the chief of the revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Cossacks</hi> that inhabit the <hi>Vkrain,</hi>
which in the <hi>Sclavonian</hi> tongue signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the Frontiers. He had a great
deal of power there, and many friends
whom he perswaded to revolt. To
carry on his enterprize the better, he
went to <hi>Constantinople</hi> to solicit the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> to make himself master
of this Province. He represented to
him, that this was the way to keep
all the <hi>Polanders</hi> in subjection, who so
often diverted his Forces, and to get
the Kingdom it self when he pleased;
promising to put the best places into
his hands, provided his Highness
would send an Army to assist him.
The <hi>Grand Visier</hi> was glad of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:51472:138"/>
not only to employ his Troops
who mutinied through idleness, but
to require satisfaction of some inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
which the <hi>Sultan</hi> had received
from the <hi>Poles.</hi> Therefore he ordered
the <hi>Tartars</hi> to be ready to joyn the
Army which he sent under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the <hi>Bassa's</hi> of <hi>Natolia</hi> and <hi>Bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sina;</hi>
and at the same time comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the <hi>Bassa's</hi> of <hi>Albania,</hi> and <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
to march with the <hi>Hospodars</hi> of
<hi>Moldavia,</hi> and <hi>Walachia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The approach of such considerable
Forces made <hi>Poland</hi> tremble. King
<hi>Michel</hi> got together about fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
men to withstand this invasion:
but notwithstanding all his precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and resistance, the <hi>Turks</hi> made
themselves Masters of <hi>Caminieck,</hi>
which was ever accounted inexpug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
and of the whole <hi>Vkrain:</hi> and
doubtless they would not have stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
there, if the preparations of the
<hi>Persian Sophy</hi> had not interrupted their
progress, and caused the <hi>Visier</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Troops to oppose him,
in case he should declare War against
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:51472:139"/>
the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> Thus this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
obtained a Truce which he
broke the next year, to continue the
War, and force the <hi>Poles</hi> to pay the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi> the Tribute he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
The death of King <hi>Michel</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
at this time, seemed to open
the way to the designs of the <hi>Turks,</hi>
if they had known how to make use
of so favourable a conjuncture to have
extended their Conquests. They as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
their divided Troops, that
they might form a more considerable
body of an Army; so that being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
without comprehending the
<hi>Walachians,</hi> and <hi>Moldavians,</hi> they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted
to about two and thirty
thousand men under the conduct of
three Generals, the chief of which
was <hi>Soliman Aga,</hi> who commanded the
<hi>Ianizaries, Vssain Spahiler Agasi,</hi> or
the Colonel of the <hi>Spahies</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Horse, and <hi>Caplan Bassa</hi> led
the Forces of the Asiatique Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
They thought of nothing less
than by taking of <hi>Leopold,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
to pay contribution, to advance
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:51472:139"/>
farther into the Country. But the
Grand Mareschal <hi>Sobieski</hi> General of
the <hi>Polish</hi> Army, not thinking fit to
expect them, resolved to hinder their
progress, though he was much inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
to his enemies in strength. He
caused the General of <hi>Lithuania</hi> to
joyn him with his Troops, that they
might stop the passage of the <hi>Turks,</hi>
who had retrenched themselves in a
very strong Camp, as well by situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as by the Works, and Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they had raised about it. The
<hi>Turkish</hi> Camp was raised on all sides,
being bounded the South by Downs,
and steep Rocks on the side of the
River <hi>Niester,</hi> over which they had
laid a Bridge, with an Half-moon at
the end of it, to defend it towards
<hi>Caminieck,</hi> which is about four leagues
off. On the East it was covered by
the Castle of <hi>Cotzchin,</hi> with which it
had communication, by means of
a little Bridge over some flowed
ground. On the North it was
strengthened by a Trench, and an
Horn-work: and on the West it was
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:51472:140"/>
raised in form of a Terrace, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
by a large depth from another
small Camp of the <hi>Moldavians,</hi> and
<hi>Walachians,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> never suffering
any strangers to incamp with them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Great Mareschal</hi> being arrived
at this Camp the ninth of <hi>October,</hi>
1673. planted two Batteries of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
to answer the enemies who fired
continually. After this he wrought so
far on the <hi>Hospodars</hi> or <hi>Walachia,</hi> and
<hi>Moldavia,</hi> who came not to the War,
but through a forced obedience, as to
perswade them to desert the <hi>Turks</hi> as
soon as the fight began: but the <hi>Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podars</hi>
fearing their correspondence
would be discovered, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
prevented, retreated the night
following, leaving part of their
Troops to the <hi>Poles,</hi> who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seized on their Post; when Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Sobieski</hi> advancing to observe the
enemies posture, and finding there
was a great disturbance in their
Camp, caused without doubt by the
departure of the <hi>Walachians,</hi> and <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davians:</hi>
he thought it expedient to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:51472:140"/>
make advantage of their disorder,
and without more delay, brought the
<hi>Lithuanian</hi> Foot to force the Camp in
the weakest place, ordering his Horse
to cover them and oppose the enemies
sally, while he attacked them in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
quarter: but when he saw that
the <hi>Turks</hi> stoutly repulsed the <hi>Lithua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
and made the <hi>Poles</hi> themselves
give ground, he put himself at the
head of the Palatine of <hi>Russia</hi>'s Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
and alighting from his Horse,
in the sight of all the Army, went to
the assault, in so difficult a place, that
he had much ado to climb up to the
top; from whence with a bravery no
less admirable than that of <hi>Alexander</hi>
the great, when he leaped into the
Town of the <hi>Oxidracans:</hi> the Great
<hi>Sobieski</hi> threw himself into the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Camp, where he alone supported
all the brunt; giving some of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantest
Souldiers who followed him,
time to level the bank, and fill up
the Trenches, that the Horse might
come in to their assistance. The <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars</hi>
who are deservedly accounted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:51472:141"/>
since by perpetual Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
they have ever gloriously main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
their reputation, immediately
incompassed their illustrious General,
who dispatch'd all that came in his
way; and having remounted him,
they followed him into the midst of
the Battle, where he faced the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
dangers, and dealing death on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
side, exhorted his Souldiers not to
plunder yet, since the vast riches of
the Camp would be assured to them
by the Victory. His example was so
prevalent, that the most backward of
his men durst not shrink from their
Leader; insomuch that the enemies
after they had four hours together
withstood a violent assault, at last dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed
their Generals commands, and
endeavoured to save themselves by
flight. Such a consternation seized
on them, that above ten thousand
cast themselves down the precipices;
all the rest were put to the Sword in
the Camp by the <hi>Poles:</hi> and some who
thought to retire to <hi>Caminieck,</hi> were
prevented by Colonel <hi>Miochenski,</hi> who
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:51472:141"/>
swam the <hi>Niester,</hi> and cut them off.
This Defeat was so great, that out
of two and thirty thousand, but fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
hundred escaped, amongst whom
was <hi>Caplan Bassa:</hi> the two other Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
<hi>Soliman</hi> and <hi>Vssain,</hi> were killed
upon the place; the first of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the honour to be slain by the
Great <hi>Sobieski,</hi> who encountering him
in the heat of the fight, dispatched
him with his Sword, and took his
Scimitar from him, which he now
wears himself.</p>
                     <p>This Camp is fatal to the <hi>Turks.
Osman,</hi> the first of that name was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated
there by the <hi>Poles,</hi> in the year
1621. commanded by young Prince
<hi>Vladislaus,</hi> King <hi>Sigismund</hi>'s Son, and
<hi>Chodkieuiki, Lubomirski,</hi> and <hi>Sobieski,</hi>
the Father of the Great <hi>Sobieski,</hi> now
King of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The news of this Victory was as
unwelcome to the <hi>Sultan,</hi> and his
<hi>Grand Visier,</hi> as it was the contrary
to the States of <hi>Poland,</hi> who were met
together to elect a King. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
they could not bestow the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:51472:142"/>
Crown on any one that deserved it
more than he who had supported, and
preserved it, when it was exposed a
prey to its most dangerous enemies;
therefore they offered it him as a just
recompence of his desert, and vertue,
and with one accord proclaimed him
King: acknowledging him to be their
lawful Prince, preferably to all other
pretenders.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Grand Visier,</hi> who before this
Defeat had rejected all overtures of
Peace with <hi>Poland,</hi> now advised the
<hi>Sultan</hi> to name his Deputies for a
Treaty; but the difficulties that were
raised as well by the <hi>Tartars</hi> as the
<hi>Grand Signior,</hi> hindered the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it. The <hi>Tartars,</hi> who cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to be at rest, and cannot live
without War, required the Turkish
Emperor to make the <hi>Poles</hi> agree with
them about the bounds of their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
which had been the occasion
of a tedious War. The <hi>Sultan</hi> on
the other side being unwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
what he had usurped, would not
relinquish his Conquests in <hi>Poland,</hi>
                        <pb n="275" facs="tcp:51472:142"/>
unless they would pay him a very
considerable yearly Tribute.</p>
                     <p>But the Great <hi>Sobieski</hi> being inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
with the Sovereign Dignity,
looked on the payment of Tribute as
a mark of dependence unworthy a
Diadem which owns no Superior
Power, and rejected the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors</hi>
Propositions, who soon took the
Field, and advanced with the <hi>Grand
Visier</hi> as far as <hi>Caminieck;</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
received news of the <hi>Sophies</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>para<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and the revolt of some
Governours, he granted a Truce to
the <hi>Poles,</hi> leaving Commissioners to
treat with King <hi>Sobieski</hi>'s Deputies,
and returned to <hi>Adrianople:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though the <hi>Sultan</hi> suffered great
losses in this War, yet it caused no
great change in the State. The
<hi>Grand Visier</hi> having pacified the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
and allayed the tumults which
the Mili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ia raised in his absence, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
himself to regulate the affairs
of the Port, endeavouring to make
the people sensible of the blessings of
Peace, by easing them of the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:51472:143"/>
taxes which the <hi>Sultan</hi> had
laid on them, to defray the expences
of the War, and to replenish his
treasury, which was exhausted by it.</p>
                     <p>This great Minister by his industry
and prudence, has so gained the esteem
and friendship of all the world, that
he is no less respected by the Army,
and the people, than the Emperor
himself, whom he governs as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
having obtained an absolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over him; which is not so much
to be attributed to the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as to his perfect knowledge of
<hi>Achmet Coprogli</hi>'s vertue, and desert,
who at this time keeps the City of
<hi>Constantinople</hi> in obedience, which is
so dissatisfied with his Highnesses
ill usage, that had it not been for his
first Minister, and the <hi>Sultana Valide,</hi>
it would lately have revolted, when
the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> threatned to take
away its priviledges. Nevertheless,
what a version soever this Prince has
for the chief City of his Empire, he
would have returned thither, if the
<hi>Grand Visier</hi> had not hindered him
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:51472:143"/>
for some secret reasons, which I may
hereafter publish in the continuation
of his Ministry, and the sequel of the
History of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family,
when I shall be furnished with new
<hi>Memoires</hi> of the most curious affairs of
the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> and the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s
Court<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> where nothing is concluded
without the advice of <hi>Achmet Coprogli.</hi>
So that one may affirm that this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
shares the Sovereign Authority,
and is the supreme Arbiter of the
powerfullest Empire in the world.
But that which is wonderful in the

his vertue and merit is so universally

worthy of his good Fortune.</p>

This Knight being often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Knights of the
Dutch Order, called <hi>Ordo
Teutonicus,</hi> in <hi>Prussia,</hi> was
for his Worthiness placed by
them at the Table, before
any of what Nation soever.
If any desire to know the
Profession of these Knights
called <hi>Teutonici,</hi> it was thus:
They having their dwelling
at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> were bound to
entertain Pilgrims, and at
Occasions to serve in War
against the <hi>Saracens.</hi> They
were apparelled in white, and
upon their uppermost Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
did wear a black Cross.
And for that this Order was
first begun by a certain rich
<hi>Almaigne,</hi> none were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into the same, save on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Gentlemen of the Dutch
Nation. After <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was
last taken by the <hi>Saracens,
Anno</hi> 1184. these Knights re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to <hi>Tolemaida;</hi> and that
being taken, into <hi>Germany,</hi>
their own Country. And
when as there also the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Prussia</hi> used Incursions
upon their Confines, they
went unto <hi>Frederick</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
then Emperour, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
1220.</hi> who granted them
leave to make Wars upon
them, and to turn the spoil
to the maintenance of their
Order. After this Conquest
of <hi>Prussia,</hi> these Knights grew
rich, and builded there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Temples and Places of
Residence for Bishops, who
also were enjoyned to wear
the Habite of the Order.
<hi>Chaucer</hi> will have his Knight
of such Fame, that he was
both known and honoured
of this Order.</item>
