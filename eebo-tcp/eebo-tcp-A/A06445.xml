            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

sleepe, (the true image of death) lest I should bee choaked in the darknesse of my sins, to the end I might haue space and time (yet at the length) to recollect, and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent my selfe.</p>
               <p>Now likewise (O father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and God of all consolation) <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.</note> I beseech thee (and from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of my heart intreat thee) that this day thou wilt take me also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy fatherly protection, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold me with thy mercifull eies, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect me in the way of thy commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dments, and giue me those gifts of thy holy spirit, by whose means I may begin, continue, and end this day likewise to the praise and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thy holy name, to the profit of my neighbors, and the saluation of my soule: endeuouring my selfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where and in all things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neglect of my duty, to discharge euery way that vocation to which I am called.</p>

I am hardned as well by thy scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as thy allurements: ingratful to these: rebellious against those. Notwithstanding (O Lord God) though thou hast suffered so many and so great things for mee, thou hast commanded me that I should not despaire, nor distrust in thy mercie: I conuert my selfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wholy vnto thy mercy, and beseech thee to giue mee grace, that I may amend my selfe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I may so heereafter please thee and serue thee, that I neuer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after reuolt from thee, but cleaue alwaies to thee for euer and euer.</p>

of my sinnes in him, who by the writing of his Prophets so oftentimes inuiteth sinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, saying, I wil not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> death <note place="margin">Ezech. 18.</note> of a sinner, but rather that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert and liue. Thy onely begotten Son likewise declareth by many similitudes how ready thou art to pardon those that are penitent. That expressed he by the lost pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, by the lost sheep, brought home on the shoulders of his pastor: but especially by the prodigall sonne, <note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> whose image I acknowledg in my selfe. For I am he that haue indeed forsaken my most louing Father: I haue spent all my substance: and obeying the appetites of my flesh, haue fled the obedience of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and haue fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the most filthy captiuity of sin: now am I trauelled with extreme necessity, from which who shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer me, I truly know not, except it be he whom I haue forsaken.</p>

For this, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance which I now haue, I could not haue had, except thou hadst beheld me.</p>
               <p>When as wandring I forsooke thee, thou lookedst vpon mee from the highest heauens, where I was furthest from thee: and didst open mine eies that I might behold thee and search my conscience, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my selfe ouerwhelmed with so much wickednesse. Come therefore (O Lord) to receiue me: giue mee the knowledge and memory of my lost innocencie: I require not thy imbracings, nor thy kisses: I pray thee not to giue mee that goodly garment y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I was wont to weare, nor the ring of my ancient dignity: I require not that thou shouldest receiue me into the state and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of thy children: but it shall

suffice mee if I may bee numbred amongst the mercenary seruants of thy house, sealed with thy mark, and tied with thy bonds, lest euer heereafter I run away from thee: It shal not grieue me, although in this life I bee one of the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible slaues of thy house, so that thou separate me not for euer from thee.</p>
               <p>Heare me therefore, most merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Father, and giue me the grace of thy onely begotten Sonne: and communicate with mee the merits of his passion.

But who shall bee worthy of this grace? who can merit this benefite? only thy mercy, O Lord, can make vs worthy of so infinite benefits. And because without the same, no man can bee worthy, O Lord, let the same bee fauourable vnto mee, let it make me partaker of so many mysteries, let it make mee thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for so inestimable a benefit: O Lord with thy grace supply all my defects, forgiue me all my sins tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row thy mercie.

For if the body of a dead Prophet could do so much, what cannot the liuing bodie of the Lord of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets doe?

For it suffised thee not in this mystery to make vs partakers of thy supreme

deity, but thou wouldest also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate vnto vs thy humanitie, together with all thy merits, which in the same, and with the same thou didst purchase for vs: for giuing vs thy body and blood, thou makest vs also partakers of thy holy trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and of all thy merits, which being on earth, thou obtainedst for vs. O admirable Communion! O treasure to be equalled by no price, and as yet vnknowne vnto men O mercifull Redeemer of our soules! with what more richer iewels, or greater riches couldest thou store vs, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with this most blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament? Deseruedly, O Lord, didst thou say in the praier, which thou saidest about the houre of thy passion: I sanctifie my selfe for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <note place="margin">Iohn 17.</note> that they also may bee sanctified in truth, namely after a new maner of sanctification, difficile to the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, and easie to the sanctified. For thine is the sanctity, O Lord: mine the fruit of sanctitie: thou didst la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, I receiued the reward: thou wert at the charge, I reapt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite: thou art chastised, &amp; I am par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned for my sins: thou drunkest

O rich Communion! O fraternity of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit merits! O traffique of inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treasure! what stocke or summe haue we imploied in this partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe? what haue we aduentured that the increase is so profitable vnto vs? Why doth the sun illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the world? why warmeth the fire the body, which is the obiect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it? why doth the water coole y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> same? The reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is manifest, for these are their naturall properties; for such creatures produce such ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: And it is thy property, O lord, to pardon; thy custom to shew mercie, and that rather to others than to thy selfe. Thy goodnesse is ours, &amp; that not ordinary, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit: for as the property of good is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon &amp; communicatiue, so truly the chiefest good should also be chiefly diffusiue: &amp; this hast thou

done vnto vs, because thou hast wholy giuen thy selfe vnto vs. In thy birth, thou becamest our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: in our nourishing, our food: in thy death, our redemption: in our ruling, our reward: finally, O my soule, if in one word thou wilt comprehend all these benefits, which this so admirable Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t bringeth with it, consider that which this Lord brought into this world, when as becoming man he came into thy world. For when he entred into the world, he gaue the world the life of grace, with al those things which attend on the same: so also when he comes by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into our soule, hee giueth the same life of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> soule. O diuine food by which the sons of men are tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the sons of God, and by which the flesh is mortified in vs, that the deity may liue in vs: O sweetest bread, worthy to bee ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nourishing the soule, not the belly: strengthning the heart, and not ouercharging the body: reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the spirit: &amp; not troubling the vnderstanding: whose vertue doth moderate our appetites, killeth our

               <p>What thanksgiuing therefore shal I yeeld vnto thee: what praises shal I sing vnto thee (O Lord) for this thy benefite? If the gratuitie ought to be answerable to the gift, what kinde of recompence I pray you will equall such a gift? Thou saidst in times past to thy seruant <hi>Moses:</hi> Take the golden vessel, and <note place="margin">Exod. 16.</note> hide it in the Arke of the couenant and it shall be kept there for future generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that they may see that meate which for forty yeares long I made you feede on in the desart. If y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> so much esteemedst (O Lord) that corruptible meate which thou gauest thy people in the desart, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou wouldest it should be kept w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reuerence, in perpetuall rememb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the same: in what account should that incorruptible meate be with vs, which giueth life eternall to those that eat the same? I mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly see that there is the same dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference which is betweene the one meate and the other, as betweene the one benefit and the other: and that for that cause there ought to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:27852:70"/>
bee the same difference betweene the one gratuitie &amp; the other; that meate was earthly, this heauenlie; that was of the bodie, this of the Soule: that gaue not true life to those that eat the same, this giueth eternall life to those that worthily receiue it. But why make I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betweene the one &amp; the other? For whatsoeuer difference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the creature &amp; the Creator, the same is betweene this and that meate. If therefore thou O Lord, require such remembrance, and gratuity for that thou didst nourish thy people with corporall and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible meate, what wilt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of vs whom thou nourishest with so farre better foode as the Creator exceedeth the creature? there is not any praise nor thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing which is worthy this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite. When as therefore I neglect mine owne forces &amp; faculties, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I finde way or meanes to pay thee that which I owe thee, there is no other remedy left for me, than w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Prophet to take y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cup of saluation, and call vpon the <note place="margin">Psal. 115.</note> name of our Lord: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerate

Too late did I feare thy Maiestie: too late did I loue thee, thou beautie both old and new: too late did I loue thee: I sought thee my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment, and I found thee not, because I vndirectly sought thee: I sought thee without my selfe, &amp; thou didst dwel in me: I trauelled the streets and waies of the Citty of this world, seeking thee, and I found thee not, because inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately I sought thee abroad, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou wert at home with mee.</p>
               <p>I asked y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> earth whether it were my God? and it answered mee no, and all things which are in the same, confessed the very same. I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Sea, the depths and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants therof, and they answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:27852:85"/>
we are not God, seeke him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue vs. I asked the fleeting aire, with all the dwellers therein, and he answered mee no. I asked hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, the Sunne, the Moone, and the Starres: neither are wee thy Gods (said they) Finally, I asked all creatures: and they cried vnto mee with a loud voice, hee that made vs is thy true God &amp; Lord. And I sayd: where therfore is my God? where shall I seek him? shew him me. And I heard a voice say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto me, God is in euery place seeke him in thy self, he filleth Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, filleth the earth, and filleth thy heart.</p>
               <p>And I came to my selfe, &amp; I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into my selfe, and I said vnto my selfe, how entrest thou hither O my God? at what doore wert thou admitted? I began to enquire &amp; examine euery one of my senses if by any of them thou didst enter, but they likewise knew not how or which waies thou camest in. For the eies say: if he be not coloured, he cannot enter by vs. The cares say, if he make no sound, hee ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not passe by vs: The nose saith, if hee
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:27852:85"/>
smell not, hee could not come by me: Taste saith, if he sauored not, he entred not by me: Touch like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise addeth, if he is not corpulent, aske me nothing of this matter.</p>
               <p>How therefore o my loue didst thou enter my soule? and didst not enter by any doore? Truly thou art light, shining in darkenes, yet such as the eie is not capable of. Thou art a voice, sweet aboue all voices, yet such a one as the eare concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not. Thou art a sweete, more fragrant than any odor, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse my taste comprehendeth not. Thou art an embracement, to bee esteemed aboue all embraces, which notwithstanding the touch attaineth not.</p>
               <p>Where wert thoutherefore, my God? where wert thou my light? where wert thou my hope? I asked &amp; it was answered me, Ascend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the superior parts of thy heart, &amp; there shalt thou find God. Truly thou art great, O God, and hast o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome our wisdome. Thou art the king of kings, and the Lord of Lords. Thou art immortall, and dwellest in vnaccessible light:
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:27852:86"/>
whom no mortall man euer saw, or shall euer see and liue. Many and great are the wonders that are reported of thee, o Lord: yet more lesse and fewer than may be said of thee, &amp; words are defectiue, where thou are neuer deficient. For thou exceedest all that which may bee spoken or thought.</p>
               <p>O onely loue, &amp; my Lord God, thou didst loue me before I loued thee, and createdst mee according to thine owne image, and madest mee Lord ouer all thy creatures. Moreouer, thou makest thine An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels spirits for me, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou hast ordained to defend mee in all my waies, lest I should hurt my foote <note place="margin">Psal. 90.</note> against the stone. Thou wouldest not permit me to be borne in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan but a Christian land, in which by the water and the holy Ghost. I am regenerate &amp; sanctified. Thou neither gauest me too much riches, nor too abiect pouerty, lest I shold either waxe proud, or grow more contemptible: but thou gauest me vnderstanding and wil, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I should know and loue thee.</p>
               <p>Thou didst cal me when I was
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:27852:86"/>
lost, &amp; knockedst at my doore, but I did not answer thee. I liued ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mine own lust, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed too much to mine owne strength, whereas neuerthelesse it was not strength but weaknesse: I would runne, and grow presently weary: and where I thought I should bee secure, there was I in greatest danger: I went away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee like y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> prodigall son, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled into a strange countrey, and dwelt therein, whereas louing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, I became vain. I was blind, &amp; I desired blindnes: I was a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, &amp; I loued seruitude: I was bound, &amp; tooke pleasure in thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: I thought bitter was sweet, and sweete was bitternes. I was wretched, and I knew it not.</p>
               <p>Whilst I liued in this most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate estate, thou didst cast thine eies of compassion vpon mee: and although without intermission I did offend thee, yet didst not thou giue ouer to reclaime me from my sins: when I wandered y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test me into the way: when I was ignorant thou taughtest me, when I did sinne, thou didst correct me:

when I was sad, thou didst com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort mee: When I did despaire, y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> didst encourage me: when I fell y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> didst raise me vp: when I stood, thou sustainedst me.</p>
               <p>I was vndone and dead, thou des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendedst vnto the dead, &amp; tookest on thee mortality: thou a king didst descend to thy seruant: &amp; to redeeme thy slaue thou didst be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray thy selfe. So much didst thou loue mee, that thou gauest thy blood for a ransome for mee: thou didst loue me (O Lord) more than thy selfe, because thou wouldst se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for mee: For this cause thou didst ransome mee from exile with so deere a price: thou didst redeeme me from thraldome: thou withhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dedst mee from punishment: thou calledst mee by thy name, thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>O therefore wretched &amp; vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate that I am, when shall I so inseparably cleaue vnto thee, as I may neuer bee withdrawne from thee?

               <p>I beseech thee therefore, O Lord, for thine own sake, illuminat mine eies with thy light: wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d my heart with thy loue: direct my steppes in the way of thy commandements, that I may neuer swerue from the same: deliuer me (o Lord) that am captiue: reduce the stray into thy wounds, raise him that is fallen; and releeue him that is euery way weakned.

I pray thee therefore, O thou fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest amongst the children of men, grant that I may desire thee, loue thee as much as I list, &amp; as much as I ought.
