            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for their Victories with triumphes by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as holy Writ doth teſtefie.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> ſo honoured their Nation, and held honoure in ſuch heigh eſteeme, that were his byrth neuer ſo meane, or reputation ſo bace; yet if hee deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any honour in their Warres, they duely gaue it him, with all the honours they could deuiſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Greatians,</hi> and ſundry other nations had the like, ſo that thereby they gaue ſuch encouragement to all ſuch as followed them in their long Warres, that euery man enforced both Courage and ſtrength in hope of Fame.</p>
            <p>Whole volumes are filled with the Honors of theſe nationes, as wee which now liue, by true recordes can teſtefie, the ſundry Famous victoryes by them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiued, and their excellent admired prowes.

But our Countries charity is too too cold, to giue Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue her due in ſuch people, the more it is to be pittyed, that ſuch men as merit either by valour, or other indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorous meanes, ſhould not be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> foſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When comming neere vnto <hi>May-yorcke,</hi> an Iland in the Sea, wee had ſight of ſixe great Gallpes men of Warre, all of <hi>Tunes,</hi> and one other Port vnder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Turke.</hi> Theſe companions came with vs, applying
<pb facs="tcp:26188:5"/>
their beſt ſtrength of Oares and Sayles, to come to vs, wee ſeeing the ſpeed they made, began to coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wee ſhould haue more to doe with them, then wee willingly would: wherevpon our Maiſter M. <hi>Harrice,</hi> cauſed the <hi>Vineyards</hi> Boate to bee hoyſted out, the <hi>Vnicorne</hi> beeing farre from vs, and the Seas beéing calme and no Winde ſtirring, ſo wee cowed our Shippe to the <hi>Vnicorne,</hi> and furlde our maine Sayle, prouiding our ſelues as well as we could: which done, we went to prayer, humbly intreating his deuine ayde, that neuer leaueth his people, to helpe vs, and to bee our comfort in this diſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>By this tyme, the Gallyes were all in fayre ſight, ſo that wee might well deſery their numbers of men. Then fiue of them left to row, and the ſixt Gally came towards vs; and hayling our Shippes after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Sea, aſked of whence we were? Our Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter anſwered, of <hi>London,</hi> and bound for <hi>Turkey.</hi> Then cryed the <hi>Turkes,</hi> All friends, all friendes. Then did they enquire what Men of Warre wee had met withall, or ſeene without the <hi>Straights,</hi> or lately? Whom wee ſimply tolde of the three Shippes wee ſpoke with: ſo away they went from vs, making ſpeed to their fiue conforts, that ſtayed for them.</p>
            <p>The ſodaine and friendly parting with this Galley, gaue vs hope wee ſhould haue no further trouble with them, nor his fellowes; yet durſt not truſt them, but made ready to defend our ſelues, as ſodainely as wee could, getting as neere vnto the <hi>Vnicorne</hi> our conſort, as wee might, that beeing neere, wee might fight with more aduantage to our ſelues, and doe our enemies the more harme, if it ſhould ſo happen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:26188:5"/>This time the Gallyes helde counſayle togeather what they ſhould doe: At length, hauing concluded our finall ouerthrow as it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeemed, they all came vpon vs with all the violent force they could: and comming vp firſt with the <hi>Vnicorne,</hi> they powred into her their ſmall Shotte, as Hayle in compariſon. They lying ſo cloſe aboard, the <hi>Vineyard</hi> made their Shotte ſo hotte vpon them, that foure of them came aboarde her, and left the <hi>Vnicorne</hi> but two.</p>
            <p>In this conflict, wee poore men were not idle, but ſo applyed our Ordinaunce, which wee laded with Croſſe-barres, Caſe-Shoote, and Round Byllets, as greatly annoyed them.</p>
            <p>In the firſt encounter, wee had our Boatſon ſlaine and one other man, and three hurt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the <hi>Vnicorne</hi> two men ſlaine, and two hurt.</p>
            <p>The Gallyes lying ſtill by vs, maintayned the fight very hotly, and plyed their Shotte vpon vs, that our turne Sides, and battered Stearne can yet witneſſe it: beſides our Sayles ſo ſhotte, that fourty poundes cannot make good that harme onely.</p>
            <p>Deadly and full of reſolution on both parties two full bowers by the Glaſſe, continued this fight; in which all our Companies, were faine to prooue Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, not onely the Maiſter and his Mates, but all the reſt: Amongſt which, I may not forget the paynes and induſtry of one of Maiſter <hi>Harrices</hi> Mates, M. <hi>Wotton;</hi> whoſe ſkill and readineſſe was ſuch, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the moſt part of our Ordinance in our quarter, which lay to doe the Enemie moſt ſpoyle, that hee did them great harme, and made them haue ſmall hope of
<pb facs="tcp:26188:6"/>
our conqueſt, which they expected.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be the all powerfull God, who after two howers of very dangerous fight, one ſhotte from the <hi>Vineyard</hi> did them ſuch ſpoyle, as with a great and moſt dreadfull ſhrieke they fell all from vs, and went their wayes. And in good time for them; for I thinke if they had ſtayed longer, they had ſome of them ſunke by our ſides; as ſhould ſeeme by their ſodaine bringing foure of them vpon the Careere to ſtop their leakes.</p>
            <p>Thus by the mercie and power of our God, were wee freed from this great and dangerous perill where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee had like to haue falled, paſt hope of man, onely his Mercy that giueth victorie at his will, preſerued vs: To whoſe bleſſed name, all prayſe and honour be rendred, who not onely ſet vs free from our Foes, but at that inſtant, ſent vs a fayre leading gale of Winde: ſo wee cut our Mayne ſayle, and kept our courſe for <hi>Leaghorne,</hi> which was the firſt Port of our diſcharge; giuing GOD moſt humble thankes for our deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>While wee made ſtay at <hi>Leaghorne,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Florences</hi> Gallyes, who are moſt tymes abroade in ſeruice, came into the Roade: in one of them was a <hi>Iew,</hi> who ſpoke with the Captaine of the Admirall Gally, and was with them when they ſet their mayned &amp; hurt men a ſhore.</p>
            <p>This Captaine reported to the <hi>Iew</hi> beeing of his acquaintance, that there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were in theſe ſixe Gallies one thouſand eight hundred men of all ſorts: and in the fight with vs, had ſlaine a hundred and fiftie, and three hundred more hurt and mayned very dangerouſly.</p>
            <p>GOD haue the prayſe for our happy deliuery, and make vs mindfull of his great mercy ſhewed vnto his
<pb facs="tcp:26188:6"/>
poore ſeruants, that while wee haue any beeing in this world, wee may with all due prayſes, acknowledge his mercy towards vs.</p>
            <p>Thus haue you heard (to the glory of God, and the deſerued commendations, of thoſe valerous and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunced ſprights) The moſt reſolute and worthy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the ſixe Gallyes; who beeing not a handfull in regard of their multitudes, which were neere Tenn for one, and ſo well appoynted with Men and Munition, that they thought themſelues ſufficient, to encounter greater forces.</p>
            <p>But we haue euer heard and knowne, that victorie conſiſteth not in ſtrength of Horſe or Man, though they ve neuer ſo mightie: but in the all Powerfull hand of God, who in the middeſt of greateſt daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, comforteth them, that with faythfull heartes call vpon him.</p>
            <p>And moſt truely, by thoſe worthy men Maiſter <hi>Harrice,</hi> and Maiſter <hi>Gardner,</hi> and there companies it appeareth, who doubtleſſe are gratious men in the preſence of God; ſuch is their gouernment, their zeale to God and his true Religion: ſuch doth God in all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes comfort, for ſo is his promiſe, that neuer fayleth his ſeruants: It is his holy hand, that hath done this for them againſt all expectation of men. For which his bleſſed name be euer prayſed.</p>
            <p>And I wiſh moſt heartily, that ſuch Owners and Merchantes, which haue ſuch faythfull people to deale for them, would not ſhut their Purſes from rewarde, but open their handes with Bounty vnto them, that others may be encouraged to doe them the like ſeruice: If ſuch men would vſe this charitie, no doubt but their
<pb facs="tcp:26188:7"/>
bounty and good countenances to men aduenturing for them would make their ſeruice to be better perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, And this Kingdome be more better repleniſhed with able and ſufficient men to fight in their defence, if occaſion ſhould bee.</p>
            <p>You haue heard the true diſcourſe of this dangerous voyage, their happie deliuerance, and dilygent cares in performing the ſame; Who making foure Ports, <hi>viz. Maliga<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Leagehorne, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Zant,</hi> as by <hi>Chartie-Partie</hi> they were bound, taking their Lading at <hi>Zant,</hi> was by the mercy of God, with Winds ſo fauored, that in good ſaffetie the Shippe and goodes ariued the twelf<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
