            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE inducements that have swayed mee to the Compiling of this Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partite History, have been, partly, for mine owne satisfaction in the survey and prospect of the times and occurrences of the world, coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and contemporary with those of the Church: partly, for the satisfaction of the
<pb facs="tcp:59068:3"/>
Reader in the same contemplation; and for the mixture of some delight with that satisfaction, in such a mixture of variety. But chiefly, for both our observation of the hand of God, good and gracious in the preservation and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Church, and just and avengefull in his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and judgements upon those two Nations that perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they could have done it, to the death, and that executed to the death the Lord of the Church, the Lord of Life: For as there were two Theeves that were crucified with our Saviour, the one on the right hand, and the other on the left; so were there two worse by far that crucified him, the Iew and the Roman: The former of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and so shall once obtaine mercy; the latter even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the confession of his innocency, and so shall perish for ever. Both persecutors of the Church, as well as crucifiers of the Lord of it, the Iewes while they continued to bee a Nation, the Romans while the Church shall bee a Church. The consideration of this very thing, doth not onely war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but even challenge a mixture of study of the Story of these three together, that the footsteps of providence might bee traced the more clearly in those two impressions of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> and <hi>Judgement</hi> dispensed in the world, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety, the former to the Church, and the latter to these two Nations, the enemies and persecutors of her, and of her Lord. I have therefore taken them up in one discourse from that very time that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se two people did undoe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by doing violence to the Lord of Glory; and for how long a processe of time the discourse doth carry them on, this volumne will speak for the present; mine intentions aime at a longer extent, if the Lord permit.</p>
            <p>The Story of the Church I have traced in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> and there have rather set my selfe to explaine and cleare what difficulties are in the Text, then to write out
<pb facs="tcp:59068:3"/>
the full History and Occurrences that are there related; for since the Euangelist hath done it with a divine Pen, it was utterly needlesse, that I may say no more, to redoe it with mine.</p>
            <p>The times of the Stories there, I have been the more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to search after, and to settle as neare as I can, and to bring into Annals, not onely for the profit that ariseth to the Reader from the knowledge of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is not little; but also for the bringing and reducing of the Story of the other Nation, into a parallel and collaterall current and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidency with them. What difficulty I have met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in this particular, any one will readily judge that doth but observe how sparing the holy Ghost hath been through all that Booke, to expresse the circumstance of the time with the relation of the things. And what I have done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the fixing of the times in this difficulty, I have tendered under the notion of conjecture, for I could goe no further; yet have I grounded those conjectures upon such reasons, as are much to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ne owne satisfaction in that matter, and so it may bee they will bee something to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>I have led on the Story in this present piece, but to the end of the Twelfth Chapter; for thitherto hath the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist that wrote the Booke, more especially dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed the planting of the Church, and the propagation of the Gospel among the Iews. And as for the rest of the Booke, from thence to the end, that bringeth the Church and Gospel among the Gentiles, I have reserved it for another part, if the Lord vouchsa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e life, leisure, and assistance.</p>
            <p>The customes and carriage of those Apostolicke times in Worship and Discipline, I have been sparing in discussing; for the Text, for as far as this present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course goeth, is sparing in offering occasion to fall upon such
<pb facs="tcp:59068:4"/>
a thing: in that part that is behind, where the Epistles of <hi>Paul</hi> are to be taken into hand, as they fall in in time, such considerations will bee usefull, and they will bee inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
            <p>The Story of the Iewes out of their owne <hi>Josephus</hi> and <hi>Philo, Egesippus,</hi> and others, the Reader will generally finde to be but a Commentary upon their owne words, <hi>His blood bee upon us and upon our children,</hi> written even in Letters of their own blood from time to time. For when that perverse and ungodly generation, had so farre refused the Gospel, and their owne good, that it had cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Lord that tendered it to them, <hi>ex illo fluere:</hi> from that time forward their ruine and decaying is written in all their stories in such Capitall Letters, that hee that runs may read it, and he that reads them, reads them not, if hee doe not observe it. This short tract of time that this Volume containeth, will tell you of three or four, or more such Anatomy Lectures in lesse then twelve yeares space; of many, and many thousands of that Nation, that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and were miserably destroyed in <hi>Judea, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Babylonia;</hi> and this but as a Preface and beginning of sorrowes and miseries that were to follow in the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the whole Nation, for despising and destroying of him that held out life unto them, but they chose his and their owne death. Some of the same Authors that have given us these prologues of their miseries, will continue the scene with further Tragedies, till their utter extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and we shall borrow an abridgement thereof from them, in the parts succeeding, if the Lord carry us on, and prosper us in that worke.</p>
            <p>And how gratefull and excellent a worke and paines might it bee, if where <hi>Josephus</hi> and <hi>Egesippus</hi> end their Story, and where <hi>Jerusalem</hi> ended her dayes, thence some
<pb facs="tcp:59068:4"/>
learned and industrious pen would out of the Iewes own <hi>Talmud</hi> and <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and other writers, continue the story of this dispersed and condemned nation till these later times, for the Illustration of the truth of those predictions of Scripture that foretell their doome, and for the eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of that justice that hath ever since haunted them, for the murder of the righteous one whom they crucified.</p>
            <p>These are the two maine things that I looke upon in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting those stories that this volume doth exhibite; if the Reader who hath more leasure shall dilate his meditations upon so sad spectacles to further extent, hee hath saved my labour, and it may be not lose his own.</p>
            <p>The Roman History, which is the third that we have to deale withall, I must referre to the Reader to find expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by which to character and censure it, for I confesse I want them: It is so full of truths so horrid and monstrous, (if I may epithite so glorious a name as <hi>truth</hi> with so vile and base adjectives) that it even gluts the eyes and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth the heart of the Reader, and though hee cannot gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say the truth of the things, yet cannot hee tell what to say to them, they are so hideous: such monsters of bloodshed and crueltie, prodigies of lust and beastialitie, <hi>Gorgons</hi> of excesse and luxury, and in briefe, the very perfections of all vitiousnesse and impietie, that it were most unfit to name them with a Christian story, were they not most fit to prove Gods high displeasure against that Antichristian Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: I have taken them up as I have found them in their owne Historians, some here, some there, abridged them as much as possible to save what labour I might, and laid them in their proper times according to the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rection of their owne Annalists. Politick or Ethicall or other observations upon them I referre to others to make, it is a thing that sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not either with my leasure or my purpose: I onely shew
<pb facs="tcp:59068:5"/>
the monster, every eye desireth to look upon such a beast: let them read upon him as their judgement leads them: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this let mee mind them to observe, that no <hi>small judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to bee read in so great sinnes,</hi> and that <hi>that Citie is very unlikely to be the head of the Church, that is so visibly the very taile of the Devill. Rome</hi> had murdered the Lord of holinesse at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> wallowes in such murders and unholinesse at home, and wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now the reason of mine addresse unto your Honour, most noble Heroe, with this my undertaking as an oblation, you may read it in your owne worth and noblenesse, and you may read it in your relation to mine owne native Country: for the one ingageth, the other inboldneth, and both overcome mee to owe all the service I can to so much worth, to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence this service by all means I can to so great noblenesse, and to hope for acceptance of this what I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And truly I could not but e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I cannot but hope that your Noblenesse will gently interpret of this errour of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance, as an offence of a most veniall nature, when the utmost damage that accrews upon it is but delay, and not detriment, and when the <hi>summa totalis</hi> of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, namely my service is the same, though there bee some difference in the coine. It hath been the course of my studies in elaborating the Harmony of the foure Evangelists; and this history, to let them grow up and thrive together, for me thought there was some equalitie in the division, to part my studies, betwixt the story of Christ in the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists, and the story of the Church in the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and to make the history of the other two nations my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation. And I cannot but accordingly be affected with the same method of their production that was of their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and allow them their vicissitudes now as they had them then: Your Noblenesse will gently dispense with these stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and contendings where the prize and mastery aimed at, is, which shall first serve you.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese following collections came out from you, and they returne unto you: they were made when I lay in your lap, with your other children, you then prosperous, and wee happy in your prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Woe is mee my mother, that your conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is so farre altered from those times, and that our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is so farre perished in your condition. How hath the Lord clouded the mother of my people in the day of his fierce anger! and how doth shee now sit in midnight, that once was clothed with the very Sunshine of the nooneday! Ah my deare Country, I have much bitternesse for thy sake that the hand of the Lord is so gone out against thee. How is thy plenty turned to pining, and thy flower to witherednesse! How is thy gold become dim, thy candle darknesse, and thy violl the voyce of those that weepe! Deare mother, how are you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come not your selfe! And <hi>Staffordshire</hi> to bee sought in <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordshire</hi> it selfe, and not to bee found! Her children either fled, or destroyed, or become her destroyers; Her townes deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late though full of inhabitants and people, her people pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished though alive and healthy, her peace gone, her joy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht, her comforts none, her hopes as little: Shee a mother forsaken, a woman forgotten, left of friends, tortured by enemies, helplesse in her selfe, hopelesse in her helpers. Wo is mee my mother, that thou hast borne mee a man of these sorrowes, that I have seene thee a woman of these miseries! It is the Lord, wee have sinned against him, wee have sinned
<pb facs="tcp:59068:6"/>
and hee hath not spared. I need say no more, I can say no more: teares take up, and prayers, and patience must make up the rest: I have spoke thus much that my dearest native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey may have a testimony, that no distance, no condition can make mee forget her. Forget my country? let my tongue forget her art and my pen her profession, if <hi>Staffordshire</hi> bee not ever in my chiefest thoughts. Put up these teares into that bottle where are the heartiest drops that are wept for you in those your sorrowes, and lay up this volume amongst those records, that shall speake of the duty, remembrance and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance of your faithfull children to you to future ages; And owne deare mother, amongst that number that most sincerely and intirely love you, honour you, and moane after you, the heart and affections, prayers and groanings, Ah poor <hi>Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> poore <hi>Staffordshire,</hi>

                        <p>Now the Evangelist at his entry into this History, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth <hi>the former Treatise</hi> of his Gospel, because this Treatise of <hi>The Acts of the Apostles</hi> taketh at that; and as that contained the life and doctrine of our Saviour himselfe, so doth this the like of his Apostles. And therefore the words immediately
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59068:12"/>
following, <hi>Of all that Iesus began to doe,</hi> may not unfitly bee interpreted to such a meaning, that <hi>Iesus began,</hi> and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles finished: though it is true indeed, that in Scripture phrase <hi>to begin to do,</hi> and <hi>to doe,</hi> do sound to one and the same sense, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.1. compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 6.1. <hi>Mark</hi> 6.2. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.54. &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Now the method that the Evangelist prescribes unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and followeth in this book is plainely this. From the beginning of the Book to the end of the twelfth Chapter, hee discourseth the state of the Church and Gospel among the Jews; and from thence forward to the end of the Book hee doth the like, of the same among the Gentiles: and therefore accordingly, although the title of the book bee <hi>the Acts of the Apostles,</hi> as of the Apostles in generall; yet doth hee more singularly set himself to follow the story of the two Apostles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul: Peters</hi> to the 13 Chapter, and <hi>Pauls</hi> after; because that these two were more peculiarly the fixed Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the circumcision, and of the uncircumcision, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.8. and so doth <hi>Moses</hi> intitle a reckoning of the heads of the Fathers houses of all the Tribes of Israel in generall, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6.14. and yet hee fixeth at the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> and goeth no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; because the subject of his Story lay especially in that Tribe, in <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi>

                        <p>There is some diversity in pointing and reading this Verse: some take it in the order and posture that our English hath it; applying the words <hi>through the holy Ghost,</hi> to Christs giving commandements; &amp; read it thus, <hi>after he had given comande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments through the holy Ghost</hi>
                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so doth the <hi>Vulgar Latine, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact, Marlorat</hi>
                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and indeed the pointing, in the best Copies. Others, as the <hi>Syrian, Arabick,</hi> &amp; <hi>Beza</hi> with them conjoin it thus, <hi>Giving commandements to the Apostles whom he had chosen by the holy Ghost.</hi> Now in the maine thing it self, there is not so much difference, as to make any great scruple or matter how the words are pointed; for Christ may as well bee said to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Disciples by the holy Ghost, as to chuse them by the holy Ghost; and so <hi>è contra.</hi> But it is materiall to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</p>
                        <p>First, that it is more proper by farre to conceive Christ acting the holy Ghost upon the Disciples, and that when they were called; then his acting him in himselfe in calling them.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that there is no mention at all of such an acting of the holy Ghost in the Disciples choosing; but there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly at their receiving their charge; and therefore not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the pointing of the Text, and the consent of divers Copies, Expositors and interpreters that read as our English doth; but even the very thing it selfe, and truth and evidence of Story require that it should be so read: Now, why Christ should be said to give commandement <hi>through the holy Ghost</hi>; and what commandement this was that was so given to them, is much in controversie.</p>
                        <p>There is mention indeed of Christ breathing of the holy Ghost upon them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.22. and of a commandement or two given them afterward, as <hi>To goe teach all Nations, Mat.</hi> 28.19. and <hi>to abide at</hi> Jerusalem <hi>till the promise of the Father,</hi> Act. 1.4. And the exposition and interpretation that is commonly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59068:13"/>
of these words doth sense them thus,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Yeare of Christ</hi> 33.</note> That Christ by the vertue of the holy Ghost in himselfe did give them these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: Whereas it is farre more agreeable to the stile and phrase of Scripture, to expound them in another sense; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Christ by the holy Ghost infused into his Disciples did command them; not by the words of his owne mouth, but by the direction of his Spirit within them: and so the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were commanded, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.6. where the Lxx use the same Greek word.</p>
                        <p>For, first, else to what purpose did hee breath the holy Ghost upon them, and bid them receive it? Sure they had something besides the Ceremony of breathing, bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; and what can that bee conceived to bee, if not the holy Ghost, to informe them of what they yet knew not, and to direct them what hee would have them to doe?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it is therefore observable, that on Pentecost day they received <gap reason="foreign">

Now Christ was not with them continually to talk with them and to instruct them, but came by times among them, and away againe: and therefore on the very first night that hee appeared unto them, hee distributed the holy Ghost among them, to bee their constant instructer, and injoyner what they were to doe, in that calling and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to which they were ingaged: and the fruit of one of these instructions and injunctions by the holy Ghost within them, was the choosing of <hi>Matthias.</hi>

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> sufficient: some render it <hi>Eating with them,</hi> as the Syrian, Arabick, <hi>Oecumenius, Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi> Vulgar Latine, <hi>Deodate,</hi> and our English in the Margin, the Rhemists, and those that follow the Vulgar, which <hi>Valla</hi> thinketh was mistaken, and read <hi>convescens</hi> in stead of <hi>conversans.</hi> Others, <hi>Assembling them,</hi> or <hi>being assembled with them,</hi> as <hi>Beza, Camerarius, Deodate,</hi> and our English in the Text; the <hi>Tigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, Spanish, French, Erasmus,</hi> and others; <hi>Epiphanius</hi> as he is cited by <hi>Camerarius,</hi> readeth it, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, and <hi>Valla</hi> as hee is cited by <hi>Erasmus</hi> saith, it is so written in some Greek Copies. For the setling therefore of the right construction of this place;</p>
                        <p>First, it is the concurrent agreement of all men, this last ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; to read the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and not <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; which word indeed the thing it self will not beare, for though Christ conversed, and was much among his Disciples after his resurrection, yet doe wee not read that hee ever lodged with them; which the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> doth properly import.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, In the difference about the translation, whether to render it <hi>eating,</hi> or <hi>being assembled</hi> with them; the current of Greek Authors in the use of the word, do vote for the latter sense, and not at all for the former, as <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Camerarius</hi> doe prove at large; and more proofes might bee given, were it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                        <p>Now this phrase seemeth to referre to Christs meeting his Disciples on the mountaine of <hi>Galilee,</hi> which hee himself had appointed for a meeting place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.16. And the words <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> may not be wanting. For in other of his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, it was accidentall and unexpected when he came among them; but upon this mount hee was <hi>assembled together with them</hi> upon appointment. And here it is like were the five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Brethren mentioned by <hi>Paul,</hi> and spoken of before; for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59068:16"/>
where was it so likely so many should have the sight of Christ at once; as in that place where he had promised that he would meet them, and had appointed to assemble with them.</p>

                           <p>Christ confineth them to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> for the receiving of the holy Ghost. 1. Because of the Prophecy, <hi>Esay</hi> 2.3.

                           <p>This is the first matter of scruple in these words: and it is materiall to take notice of it, the rather, because that this same Evangelist hath made mention of the Mount of Olives in his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther booke, and yet never taketh notice of the distance of it from Jerusalem before, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.29.37. &amp; 22.39.</p>

                              <hi>Sect. 2.</hi> Why the Evangelist doth measure this distance by a Sabbath dayes journey, rather then any other measure.</head>
                           <p>This also is not impertinent to take notice of, because nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the present time, nor the present action had any reference to the Sabbath day at all: For had it been either the Jews Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, or the Christian Sabbath, when this thing was done; it were easie to see why the measure of the distance betwixt these two places, is by such a standard; but since it was in the middle of the week when our Saviour ascended, and neare neither the one sabbath nor the other, it cannot but breed some just scruple why the Evangelist should mention a Sabbath dayes journey here.</p>
                           <p>But before we can give satisfaction to these two scruples, it is in a kind necessary to resolve one or two more which are of no lesse, if not of a greater difficulty: and those are;</p>

                           <p>This last, must first fall under determination, and it is not of small obscurity in regard of the different measures that are made of it, and in regard of the different glosses that are made upon this Text.</p>
                           <p>The Syriack readeth it thus, <hi>Which was from</hi> Jerusalem <hi>seven furlongs.</hi> And this hath bred some difficulty more then was in the next before; for that <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, Mount Olivet was but five furlongs from <hi>Ierusalem, Antiq. lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. And <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangelist saith, <hi>Bethany</hi> was 15 furlongs from Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.18. And certaine it is that <hi>Luke</hi> in this place spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the distance from Olivet, or from <hi>Bethany,</hi> or from both; and yet the Syriack glosse upon him, hath found out a measure
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59068:19"/>
that agrees neither with <hi>Iosephus,</hi> nor with <hi>Iohn.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>There is a like difference between their opinions that come to measure this space not by furlongs, but by another mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; some holding it to be two thousand paces, or two miles; others two thousand cubits, or but one mile: This latter to have been the measure of a Sabbath dayes journey, namely, two thousand cubits, is apparent in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> and it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed out of other Writers of the same Nation; for this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is in the Tractate of <hi>Erubbin,</hi> Chap. 4. <gap reason="foreign">

                                    <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                                 </gap>: We are commanded to keep the Sabbaths and the holy dayes; so as to goe not above two thousand cubits.</hi> And this traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or custome seemeth to be fetched from that place in <hi>Iosh.</hi> 3.4. where, because the people in their march after, and on either side the Arke, were to keep twenty Cubits distance off it; it is thereupon concluded, that they pitched at that distance when the Arke &amp; they were encamped; and so that that was the space that they went from their Tents to the Tabernacle on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day: it is not worth the labour, to examine the truth of this opinion in this place; because wee have not here so much to deale with it, as with a custome built upon it: and it is not so materiall whether that was the distance betwixt their Tents and the Tabernacle in their encampings in the wildernesse (for some of them were double, treble that distance) as certain it is, that a custome was grown from this opinion of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling no further then two thousand Cubits on the Sabbath day; and to this custome the Evangelist speaketh, and that is it that wee must look after. Now if wee count these two thousand Cubits for whole yards, then was the space a mile, and above halfe a quarter, or somewhat above nine furlongs in all: but if for half yards, which was the common Cubit, then was it but half so much, and neither of these summes agree with the Syriacks seven furlongs, nor with <hi>Iohns</hi> fifteene. But the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59068:20"/>
latter agreeth very well with <hi>Iosephus</hi> his five, and so doe I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the measure to be.</p>
                           <p>For, first, it were easie to prove that the Cubit by which the Tabernacle was measured at the building of it, both for its own body, and for the ground it stood upon, and its Court, and all things about it, was but the common Cubit of half a yard; and it is most likely that those two thousand Cubits that did distance the people from it in the wildernesse, and that measured out a Sabbath dayes journey now, were Cubits of the same size.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the Text of <hi>Luke</hi> exactly measures the distance from the Mount of Olives to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and it is very questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable whether hee intend the space from that place upon the Mount where our Saviour ascended, or no. Hee saith in the last Chapter of his Gospel, that <hi>Iesus</hi> led the Disciples out, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, Vers. 50. not towards <hi>Bethany,</hi> but as far as unto it, as our English, and the Syriack, the Vulgar, <hi>Beza,</hi> and others doe truly render it: now <hi>Bethany</hi> was about fifteene furlongs from Jerusalem, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.16. and let us take the two thousand Cubits how we will, either common or holy Cubit, either half yard, or yard; or <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Cubit, of a Cubit and hand breadth: Yet will none of these measures reach to so many furlongs.</p>
                           <p>Now howsoever <hi>Beza</hi> hath sought to heale this difference by a supposall that <hi>Bethany</hi> was not only the name of a Town, but also a tract or a space of ground that lay about the Town, as a Lordship or Parish lyeth about the Village; &amp; that though the Town it self lay fifteene furlongs from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> yet that the grounds and demeanes that carryed the same name, reacht within half that space to <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; the grounds of such a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posall are yet to seek; nay, there is good ground to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                           <p>For first, it is rare in Scripture to find open fields called by the name of a Towne, when there is no expression that the fields are meant: particularly, if we should reckon up all the Townes named in the Bible that beare a <hi>Beth,</hi> in the beginning of them, as <hi>Bethlehem, Bethshemesh, Bethsaida, Bethel,</hi> and all the rest that are of the like beginning, wee could never find that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59068:20"/>
they signifie any thing but the very town it self; and why <hi>Bethany</hi> should be singular, <hi>I</hi> see no reason.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, in all the mentioning of <hi>Bethany</hi> in other places in the Gospel, it is past peradventure that the Town is meant; as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.17. <hi>Mark</hi> 11.11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.1. &amp;c. and why it should not bee so also in <hi>Luke</hi> 24.50. had need of cogent reasons to demonstrate.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, it is very questionable whether <hi>Bethphage</hi> lay not betwixt <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Bethany</hi>; or if it did not, it lay very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle aside the way, as might bee shewed out of the storie of Christs riding into Jerusalem, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.1. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.29. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.1. and therefore that was like to cut off the name of <hi>Bethany,</hi> that it should not reach farre in the fields to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the City: For Christ lay in <hi>Bethany</hi> all night, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.1. and on the morning was gone some way towards <hi>Ierusalem</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee met with the Asse on which hee rode, which hee had commanded his Disciples to fetch from <hi>Bethpage,</hi> which was <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                              <hi>before them,</hi> as the Syrian well renders it; that is, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directly in their way to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or very little off it; as they were now setting out of <hi>Bethany</hi> thither. And this is confirmed by the glosse upon the <hi>Gomar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap> in Sanhedrin, porch.</hi> 1. where mention being made of <hi>Bethphage,</hi> in the Text the Scholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ast saith, Bethphage <hi>was a place before the wall of the City, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned as</hi> Jerusalem <hi>in all things.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It is therefore of the most probability, that Christ when hee ascended, led out his Disciples to <hi>Bethany</hi> Town, fifteen fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or thereabout, and that very way that hee had riden triumphantly into the City seven and forty dayes agoe, hee goeth now again to ride more triumphantly into heaven. The Text then that we have in hand doth not measure the space from the City to <hi>Bethany</hi> where Christ ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but from the City to the foot of Mount Clivet, on which Mount, <hi>Bethany</hi> stood; and the measure hee maketh of it is two thousand common Cubits, or about five furlongs. And so we have done with two of the Quaeries that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. But now why he should measure this space at this time rather then any other, and why by the title of a Sabbath days journey, rather then any other measure, remaineth yet to bee inquired after.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="20" facs="tcp:59068:21"/>This Evangelist hath divers times in his Gospel mentioned this Mount, as was shewed before; but never shewed the situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or distance of it from the City till now, and that may be a reason why hee doth it here, being the last time that ever hee is to mention it in all his writings; and that one place might explaine another: Namely, that from this Text the severall passages done on Mount Olivet which are mentioned in his Gospel, might receive some illustration, and it might bee known how farre they were acted from Jerusalem; or at the least guessed how farre, it being from hence determined, how farre the foot of Olivet was distant from it: It had been indeed as ready to have said they returned from <hi>Bethany,</hi> which was from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> about fifteene furlongs; but the holy Ghost is not so carefull to measure the distance from the place of Christs ascension (it may bee for the same reason that hee concealed the grave of <hi>Moses,</hi> for feare of superstition) as to measure from Olivet where so many, and remarkable occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences besides Christs ascension had passed, and been done by him.</p>
                           <p>Why hee measureth it by the title of <hi>Sabbath dayes journey,</hi> rather then by any other measure, as of paces, furlongs, or the like, since this day that was spoken of is not a Sabbath, wee dare not bee too curious to determine: Onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, it is very probable, that this was the common walke of the people of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> on the sabbath day in pleasant wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for their meditations, when they had done the publique duties of the day: For so it is said of Christ, that hee often resorted to a garden of <hi>Gethsemani</hi> with his Disciples, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.2. and though it bee not certaine whether hee did on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; yet it is certaine that hee did on the passeover night, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he and his Disciples had done the work of the day and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. And that time of the day fell under the same obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Sabbath did in this particular. For, as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served even now out of the Chaldee Paraphrast, not onely on the Sabbaths, but also on other holy dayes it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to walke above two thousand Cubits; and this time that our Saviour set thither, was the beginning of such a day: namely, of the first day in the Passeover weeke, which was to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59068:21"/>
be observed as a Sabbath, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.7. and that day was begun at that even when our Saviour went out to <hi>Gethsemani</hi> to pray. And though <hi>Iudas</hi> slipt from behinde his Master after they were risen from the Table and come out of the House, and when he should have gone out of the City with him, he stept aside into the City, and got his cursed traine up to go to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend <hi>Iesus</hi>; yet the Text assures us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.2. that <hi>Iudas</hi> knew where to have him, though he went not to observe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hee would goe; because that that was our Saviours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon retiring place upon such occasions. And so may wee conceive it was the common haunt of others of the City, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such times, and such occasions of prayer and meditation to resort thither, for the delightsomnesse of the place, and the helpfulnesse of it by the delight and solitarinesse to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. And therefore the Evangelist may bee conceived to use this expression for the measure betwixt it and the City, <hi>A Sabbath dayes journey</hi>; because it was most remarkably so; not onely upon obligation, but for delight, and the peoples common Sabbath dayes walk.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59068:23"/>
and chiefe actor; nay, commonly the sole speaker and actor upon all occasions: Not that the rest of the Apostles were either any whit inferiour to him, either in authority or in forwardnesse to promote the Gospel; but upon these two most singular and peculiar grounds.</p>
                        <p>First, <hi>Peter</hi> was designed by a more speciall deputation and appointment to be the Minister of the Circumcision, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.8. and therefore while the Story stayeth among the Circumcised, it still mentioneth <hi>Peter</hi> above all the other: as when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to speake of the uncircumcised, then it fixeth solely on the story of <hi>Paul.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Peter</hi> was considerable under a notion that none of the rest of the twelve had fallen under namely, one that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed &amp; foresworn his Master: and therefore it was in some kind necessary that some speciall evidences of his perfect recovery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine should be given. And whensoever hee is thus honoured by mention of him, when the rest are not mentioned, it is not for that hee outstript them either in dignity, or zeale; but to shew that hee had recovered that ground which hee had lost of them in his grievous fall. And these two considerations doe mainely resolve, why you read hardly of any mans spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or any mans actions but only <hi>Peters.</hi> He is the speaker in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. at the first conversion of the three thousand soules; and hee is the speaker in <hi>Act.</hi> 3. at the second conversion of five thousand more; not that the rest of the company did not preach and speak as well as he; as we shall prove for that first Sermon on <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and as the holy Ghost it selfe approves for that second, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.1. But because, at these first fruits of the Gospel among the Circumcised, the Lord more especially holdeth out the mention of the Minister of the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                        <p>And so in this motion for the choice of a new Apostle, and in that doom again on <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira, Peter</hi> of all other is the Man: for how fully and how fitly doth it shew his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect recovery, when he that of all the rest, had fallen next to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> doth censure <hi>Iudas</hi>; and he that had denyed his Master with an oath, doth strike those dead for a lie?</p>

                           <p>For, first, in Scripture account, most constantly the recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is of men; and women very rarely brought in in the number: nay sometime the reckoning plainely shewed to bee contradistinguished to women.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the name of a family continueth in the males, but is lost in the females; and therefore in the Hebrew, a male is called <hi>Zacar,</hi> from <hi>remembrance</hi>; and women <hi>Nashim,</hi> from <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting</hi>; and in the New Test: Greek, men are called <hi>Names</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like reason.</p>

                           <p>This summeth the men that are spoken of in the verse prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; the twelve Apostles, the seventy Disciples, and about thirty eight more, all of Christs own kindred, country, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</p>
                           <p>These one hundred and twenty here spoken of, are not to bee reputed or accompted as the whole number of beleevers at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> at this time; but only those that had followed Christ continually, <hi>Verse</hi> 21. were of his owne Countrey, stood in more neare relation to him, as being of his owne family and society, and appointed by him for the Ministery.</p>
                           <p>The Beleevers at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> no doubt were many hundreds, if not thousands at this time; though wee read of no converts in this booke, till the next Chapter.

that there should be lesse beleevers in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> now then many hundreds, much more unimaginable that these one hundred and twenty were al, who were all <hi>Galileans,</hi> and no inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> at all.</p>
                           <p>This number therefore mentioned by the Evangelist of one hundred and twenty, is not to be thought all the Church in that City; but onely the society and company that were of Christs own traine and retinue whilst hee was upon earth, that companied with him all the time that hee went in and out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Disciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.21. And this company though it bee mingled and dispersed among the Congregations in the City for preaching the Word, and administring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and joyning in acts of worship; yet did they keepe together as a more intire and peculiar society, and standing Presbytery, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.21. and of the rest durst none joyne himselfe unto them, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.13. and thus they continued till the persecution at <hi>Stephens</hi> death dispersed them all but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.1.</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59068:25"/>
Church might bee parallel to the twelve Tribes, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Jewish; for now Jewes and Christians were to joine together: and this is hinted in the twenty foure Elders, the representative body of the Church so often mentioned in the Revelation; and spoken out <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.12.14.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, that <hi>Matthias</hi> and <hi>Ioses</hi> being chosen to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Apostles, the election was not the choice of the whole Church, as if every member of the Church, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> either did or might give his vote to the choosing of them; but it was onely the choice of the whole Presbytery, or the hundred and eight among themselves: for so is it most plaine, vers. 15. &amp; 21. being compared together.

                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, that the Apostles could not ordain an Apostle by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hands, as they could ordain Elders, but they are forced to use a divine lot, which was as the immediate hand of Christ imposed on him that was to bee ordained: that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on took little notice of this circumstance, that hath placed Bishops in the place of the Apostles, by a common and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive ordination.</p>

                        <p>This seemeth to bee hee that is called <hi>Ioses, Mark</hi> 6.3. &amp; 15.40. the brother of <hi>Iames</hi> the lesse: and the rather to bee so supposed, because he is surnamed <hi>Iustus,</hi> as <hi>Iames</hi> was.

                        <p>Secondly, although the Apostles belike had named these two <hi>Iosephs</hi> to distinguish them, the one <hi>Barsabas,</hi> and the other <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi>; two names that are not farre asunder in sound and utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;

                           <p>Secondly, the morrow after this Sabbath of which wee have spoken, or the sixteenth day of the moneth <hi>Nisan,</hi> was the solemne day of waving the sheafe of the first-fruits before the Lord, and the day from which they began to count their seven weeks to Pentecost, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.11. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.9.</p>
                           <p>This day then being the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59068:27"/>
and so the rest accordingly.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, now in their counting from this morrow after the Sabbath, or this day of their first-fruit sheafe, to Pentecost, seven Sabbaths or Weeks were to bee compleat: whereupon <hi>R. Solomon</hi> doth very well observe, that the count must then begin at an evening; and so this day after the Sabbath was none of the fifty; but they were begun to bee counted at Even when that day was done: so that from the time of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the first-fruit sheafe, Pentecost was indeed the one and fiftyeth day; but counting seven weekes compleate, when an evening must begin the account, it is but the fiftyeth.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, to this therefore it is that the phrase of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelist speaketh, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, which our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish hath very well uttered, <hi>the day of Pentecost was fully come;</hi> thereby giving an exact notice how to fix the day that is now spoken of from our Saviours death, and to observe that he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the time of the day indeed, and not of the night which was now over, and the day fully come.</p>
                           <p>The dependance of Pentecost upon this day of waving the first-fruit sheafe, was upon this reason; because on this second day of the Passeover, barley harvest began; and from thence forward they might eat parched corne, or corne in the eare; but by Pentecost their corne was inned and seasoned, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make bread, and now they offered the first of their bread. This relation had this feastivall in the common practise, but something more did it beare in it as a memoriall; for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded the delivering of the Law at mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which was given at the very same time: And thus the giving of the Law at <hi>Sinai,</hi> for the bringing of the Jews into a Church, and the gift of the holy Ghost at <hi>Sion</hi> for the like of the Gentiles, did so nearely agree in the manner of their giving, both in fire, and in the time, both at Pentecost. Onely, as the Christian Sabbath was one day in the week, beyond the Jewish Sabbath; so this Pentecost when the holy Ghost was given, was one in the moneth beyond the Pentecost at the giving of the Law, that being on the sixth day of the moneth <hi>Sivan,</hi> and this on the seventh.</p>

                           <p>As our Saviour by rising on the first day of the weeke had honoured and sealed that day for the Christian Sabbath, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the Jewish, which was the day before; and as is said by the Psalmist, that was <hi>the day which the Lord had made,</hi>

                           <p>And let it not be tedious to take in the account of five or six dayes before his passion: which though it may bee a little <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rergon,</hi> or besides this purpose, yet may it not be uselesse or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable: nay, in some respect it is almost necessary, since we cannot in reason but begin our Kalendar from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the moneth <hi>Nisan,</hi> though our Saviour suffered not till the fifteenth day of it.</p>

                              <hi>Sect. 3.</hi> That many, if not all of the <hi>120</hi> received the holy Ghost, and the gift of tongues on Pentecost day; and not the twelve onely.</head>
                           <p>For first, divers, if not all of them, were appointed by Christ to bee Ministers of the Gospel, as well as the Apostles, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. and for this purpose had received the power of miracles, as well as they, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. they had received the holy Ghost on the resurrection day, as well as they, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.22. compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 24.33, 36. had conversed with Christ both before and after his resurrection as well as they; had received the promise of the Father as well as they: Nay, they were to preach to people of strange languages as well as they: and then what possible reason can bee given, that they should bee denyed this qualification of the gift of tongues, fitting them for that purpose, any more then the twelve?</p>
                           <p>That divers of them were Ministers, if not all, there can bee no scruple, what else was become of the seventy Disciples? And that, if they must preach, they must preach to some of strange tongues, there can be as little, since experience shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Ierusalem</hi> it selfe so full of this variety; and since a few yeares will let all the preachers loose to preach to the Gentiles as they met with occasion. Nay, wee shall finde this justified by the practise of certain of them, as wee goe along.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, it is true indeed, which is objected by some, that these words, <hi>They were all together,</hi> do come so neare to the last
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59068:30"/>
verse of the former Chapter, which mentioneth onely the twelve, that it may seem to speake of them onely together at this time: yet doth both that verse and this as fully referre to the 120. in the 15 verse.</p>
                           <p>For, 1. The Evangelist doth lay that number from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry first, as the subject of his History, though his aime bee more especially at the twelve Apostles: as in his history of the twelve Apostles, his History sixeth chiefly on <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="2">2. What should keep and separate the 108 from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Apostles at this time above all others? The Text tells us they were <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, abiding and continuing together, in one place, and in one society, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.13, 14. and so the progresse of the story giveth us assurance they were till persecution parted them, <hi>Chapt.</hi> 8. and it is very strange, that on this day, above all dayes, the high day of Pentecost, the holy day of the christian Sabbath, the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest day of expecting the promise of the Father, that on this day they should bee parted from their society.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, look but upon the qualifications of the seven Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, how they were full of the holy Ghost, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.3. how <hi>Stephen</hi> was full of power, and miracles, and wisdome, and an irresistible spirit, <hi>verse</hi> 8.10. and how <hi>Philip</hi> was of the like qualifications, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.6. and when, and where, and how can it be supposed that these men came by these gifts, if not upon Pentecost day, and jointly with the twelve Apostles? If it shall bee answered, that it may bee they received them from Christ, when hee sent them to preach before his passion, as <hi>Luke</hi> 10.17. then let it bee shewed how <hi>Barnabas</hi> came by his variety of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, to bee able to preach intelligibly wheresoever he came, if not on this day?</p>
                           <p>It being therefore not to bee denyed, that there were divers others besides the twelve, if not the whole hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (which I rather thinke) that received the holy Ghost in the gift of tongues at this time, and that they were Ministers as well as the Apostles: it argueth, first, that there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Congregations in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> from hence forward, or else how should so many Ministers there have employment in their calling? And secondly, that those that went up and downe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59068:31"/>
preaching upon the dispersion by persecution, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.4. &amp; 11.19. were not ordinary members of the Church, or as we have used to call them, meere lay-men, but these men of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall function, and of Christs owne designation for that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>

                        <div n="4" type="section">

                              <hi>Sect. 4.</hi> The reason of the use of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, so often in this Story.</head>
                           <p>The intent of this word is the rather to bee looked after, by how much the lesse it is used in all the New Testament beside, and by how the more frequently in this Story. It is used in reference to the twelve Apostles alone, Chap. 1.15. it is used here in reference to the whole hundred and twenty; and to the whole number of beleevers, Chap. 2.46.</p>
                           <p>Now the reason why the Evangelist doth so often harpe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this string and circumstance of <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, or of their conversing together <hi>with one accord,</hi> may bee either in respect of the twelve, and one hundred and twenty, or in respect of all the believers.</p>
                           <p>First, the Apostles had been exceedingly subject in the life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of Christ, to quarelsomnesse and contention about prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and who should be the chiefest, as <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.34. <hi>Mark.</hi> 20.24. Yea, even at the very Table of the Lords last Passeover and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.24. And therefore it hath its singular weight and significancy, and sheweth a peculiar fruit of Christs brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the holy Ghost upon them, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.22. when it is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that they now so sweetly and unanimously converse toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without emulation, discord, or comparisons.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the 108 Disciples were in a subordinate or lower fourm, in regard of some particulars, to the twelve Apostles; and yet was there no heart-burning, scorning, or envying, no disdaining, defying, or controlling of any one towards another; but all their demeanor carryed in the unity of the Spirit, and the bond of peace.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, if those two places in Chap. 2.46. &amp; 5.12. bee to bee applyed to the whole multitude of beleevers (of the latter there may be some scruple) the word <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> there doth sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59068:31"/>
set out the sweet union that the Gospel had made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, though they were of severall Countries, severall conditions, and severall Sects; yet in <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, in sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glenesse of heart, as they did <hi>convenire</hi> in the <hi>tertio</hi> of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, so did they <hi>convenire</hi> affectionately <hi>inter se.</hi> And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to bee the accomplishment of those prophecies that had foretold the peacemaking of the Gospel, as <hi>Esa.</hi> 11.6. &amp; 60.18. &amp; 65.25. &amp; 66.42. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it was an eminent fruit of Christs doctrine, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15.12. of his prayer, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.17. and of his legacy, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.27.</p>

                           <hi>Verse 5.</hi> And there were dwelling at Ierusalem, Iews, &amp;c.</head>
                        <p>It was indeed the Feast of Pentecost at this time at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but it was not the feast of Pentecost that drew those Jewes from all Nations thither.</p>
                        <p>First, it was not required by the Law, that these Jewes that dwelt dispersed in other Nations should appeare at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> at these Feasts.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it was not possible they should so doe, for then must they have done nothing else but goe up thither, and get home againe.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, these Jews are said <hi>to dwell</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and they had taken up their residence and habitation there: but those that came up to the Feastivalls, stayed there but a few dayes, and so departed to their own homes.</p>
                        <p>The occasion therefore of these mens flocking so unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously from all the Nations of the world, was not the Feast of Pentecost, but the generall knowledge and expectation of the whole Nation of the Jews, that this was the time of <hi>Messias</hi> his appearing and comming among them.</p>
                        <p>This they had learned so fully from the Scriptures of the old Testament, especially from <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. that both the Gospel, and their owne writers witnesse, that this was the expectation of the whole Nation, that the <hi>Messias</hi> was now ready to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
                        <p>In the Scripture, these passages assert this matter, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.26 38. &amp; 3.15. &amp; 19 11. &amp; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.20, 21.</p>
                        <p>In the Hebrews own writings we may finde divers that speak to the same matter, as that <hi>The Sonne of David shall come about the time when the Romans have reigned over Israel nine moneths, from</hi> Mic. 5.3. <hi>that his appearing shall bee under the second Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that it shall bee not very long before Ierusalem should bee destroyed</hi>; and many such passages; fixing the time of the <hi>Messias</hi> his comming, to the very time that <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazaret</hi> did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and approve himselfe to bee the Christ, as may bee seen in <hi>Sanedrin, cap.

that when the wretched and blasphemous Jewes cannot tell what to say to their own Doctors, that assert the time so punctually agreeable to the time of Christs appearing, they have found out this damnable and cursed way to suppresse that truth, as to curse all those that shall bee industrious to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute these times; for they have this common execration, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </p>
                        <p>And to these might bee added that Eclogue of <hi>Virgill,</hi> which is titled <hi>Pollio,</hi> in which hee doth clearly speake of a new world then beginning, of a childe to come from Heaven, of a wondrous repaire of the world in point of happinesse, and the like; that it cannot bee doubted but this same opinion was got into the West also, as well as in the East, very many of the Jewes being there also, and raising this expectation, as well as in the other place.</p>
                        <p>So that this expectation and thought being so generall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Nations of the Jews, yea, among other Nations

also; that this was the time that the kingdome of God in the comming of Christ should appeare; this was it that brought such multitudes to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> about this time out of all Nations under heaven, to see the accomplishing of those things that they so earnestly &amp; eargerly longed and looked after: and this made them to take up their dwellings and residence in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and to resolve to settle there; for that though they were acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the time of Christs comming, yet were they not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the manner of his Kingdome, but expected that it should bee earthly and pompous, and his Royall seat in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as the Disciples themselves opinionated; yea, even after long converse with Christ himself, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.20. <hi>Acts</hi> 1 6.

wheresoever they were, in East or North, spake some of these languages, throughout the vast space of that their scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.

                        <p>So that it is hard to find, if not impossible, any Jews at this time under heaven, where one or other of these languages here mentioned were not spoken vulgarly in that Country where they were; and so may wee very properly understand that phrase, <hi>there were Iewes of all Nations under heaven,</hi> now ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Now as it was impossible for these to understand one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the languages of the Countries where they were born; for it was impossible an <hi>Arabian</hi> should understand a <hi>Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>For first, how easie is it to shew how the Hebrew tongue was utterly lost among them from common use; and how the Syriack which was in common use in <hi>Iudea,</hi> yet was unknown to them in other Countries, as appeareth by the necessity of the <hi>Chaldee Turgum,</hi> by the most familiar use of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi>

by the writings of <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Iosephus,</hi> and others of the Jews themselves.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, if they could have understood any one language, which was as the common language of the Nation; then was the gift of tongues most utterly needlesse: for why should the Apostles speak divers languages to them that could have all of them understood one tongue? Tongues indeed were given for a signe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.22. but this was not the proper end for which they were given, but for instruction and edification; and as was said before, for acquainting those Nations with the knowledge of God, which had lost it and him, by the losse of the Hebrew tongue. And if the Jewes had understood all of them one tongue, this gift had been needlesse to have beene given till the Apostles were to goe to preach to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</p>
                        <p>This then being past all deniall, that these Jewes of severall Nations, could neither understand one another in the tongue of the Countrey where they were borne, nor understand any one language as common to them all; it is past all deniall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that when they were converted to Christianity, they were severed into divers Congregations; for else it was impossible for them to joyne together in publike worship.</p>

But their words proceed from this occasion as I should suppose; these Folkes that mocked were Natives of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> or <hi>Iudea,</hi> and not understanding the languages of the Nations there present, they could not tell that the Disciples spake those strange languages when they did speake them; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they had babbled some foolish gibberish, and canting they themselves could make nothing of, as drunken men are

used to doe. And this caused their so wretched a construction of so divine a gift. For the Iews of the strange Nations and languages, that perceived and understood that the Disciples did speak in their languages; were amazed, and said one to another, What meaneth this? Ver 12.

                        <p>Reason it self, if the Text did not, would readily resolve, that it was not <hi>Peter</hi> alone that converted the 3000 that are mentioned after; but that the rest of the Apostles were sharers with him in that worke: For if <hi>Peter</hi> must bee held the onely Oratour at this time, then must it needs bee granted, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the 3000 which were converted were al of one language; or that the one language that he spake, seemed to the hearers to be divers tongues; or that hee rehearsed the same speech over and over againe in divers languages, any of which to grant, is senselesse and ridiculous; and yet unlesse wee will runne upon some of these absurdities, wee may not deny, that the rest of the twelve preached now as well as <hi>Peter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the Text, besides this, gives us these arguments to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the matter to bee undoubted:</p>
                        <p>First, it saith, <hi>Peter</hi> stood forth <hi>with the eleven,</hi> vers. 14. Now, why should the eleven be mentioned standing forth, as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> if they spake not as well as hee? They might as well have sitten still, and <hi>Peters</hi> excuse of them would as well have served the turn. It was not <hi>Peter</hi> alone that stood forth to excuse the eleven, but <hi>Peter</hi> and the eleven that stood forth to excuse the rest of the hundred and twenty.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it is said, <hi>They were pricked in their hearts, and said
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59068:35"/>
to Peter, and to the rest of the Apostles, What shall we doe</hi>? Vers. 37. Why should they question and aske counsell of the rest of the Apostles as well as <hi>Peter,</hi> if they had not preached as well as hee?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, and it is a confirmation that so they did, in that it is said, Ver. 42. They continued in the Doctrine of <hi>the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>; of the rest, as well as <hi>Peter.</hi>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59068:40"/>
here, that the beginning of <hi>Samuels</hi> Propheticknesse in this rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, is not from the death of <hi>Eli,</hi> but from one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares after. And here let me take up a verse of as much difficulty, and of as little observing of it, as almost any in the Old Testament: as that is 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.2. <hi>And it came to passe while the Arke abode at</hi> Kiriath-jearim, <hi>that the time was long; for it was twenty yeares: and all the house of</hi> Israel <hi>lamented after the Lord.</hi> Now the Arke was undeniably above forty yeares in <hi>Kiriath-jearim</hi>; namely, all the time from <hi>Elies</hi> death, till <hi>David</hi> fetcht it to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was seven and forty yeares, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above, onely that first excepted, in which it was seven moneths in the Land of the Philistims, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.1. and a little time in <hi>Bethshemesh</hi>; what then should bee the reason that it is said to bee in <hi>Kiriath-jearim</hi> onely twenty yeares? Why, the meaning is not that that was all the time that it was there, but that it was there so long a time, before the people ever hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened after it. Their idolatry and corruption of Religion had so transported them, that they thought not of, nor took regard to the Arke of God for twenty yeares together: <hi>Then all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord:</hi> for so must it bee rendred; and not, <hi>And all the house of Israel, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And so have wee one and twenty yeares taken up from the Death of <hi>Eli</hi> till this time of <hi>Israels</hi> repentance, which yet are counted to <hi>Samuels</hi> forty, but are not reckoned in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> of the extent of the race of the Prophets.</p>
                        <p>Upon this place therefore we may take up these pertinent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations.</p>
                        <p>First, that God did now on a suddain poure a spirit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation generally upon all the people of Israel after a long time of prophanenesse and Idolatry. They had been excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly prophane in the time of <hi>Elies</hi> sons: And therefore the Lord in justice forsook his Tabernacle in <hi>Shiloh,</hi> the Tent which hee had pitched <hi>besides Adam,</hi> when Israel passed through <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, Iosh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.60. and hee gave the Arke into the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies hand; yet was not Israel humbled for it. The Arke was restored to them, and was among them twenty yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and they continued in their Idolatry still, and never sought after it, nor took it to heart. At last, upon a suddaine,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59068:40"/>
and with a generall conversion, <hi>Israel</hi> begins to turne to the Lord, and lament after him, and forsake their Idols.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, here was a strange and wondrous spirit of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion poured upon the people at the beginning of the race of the Prophets, as there was at the end of it, in these Chapters of the Acts of the Apostles.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, as the practise here in the Acts, was to repent and to bee baptized; so was it then with Israel; as that expression may most properly bee interpreted, ver. 6. <hi>They drew water and poured it out before the Lord,</hi> as washing or baptizing themselves from their Idolatry.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59068:41"/>
former times, so still were the holy Robes laid up there all his time, and all the time of <hi>Archelaus</hi> his Sonne: after the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of <hi>Archelaus,</hi> from his kingdome, and the confiscation of his estate, this Tower came into the Romans hands, and was kept as a Guard or Garison by them; and the High Priests gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments laid up there under their power, till <hi>Vitellius,</hi> as wee shall see hereafter, did restore them to the Jews own keeping. <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 15. <hi>cap.</hi> 15.

                        <p>This grievance of the Priests, Sadduces, and Captaine of the Temple, proceeded from severall principles and causes. The Captaines distaste was for feare the businesse should tend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation or tumult: the Sadduces, because they preached the resurrection of the dead, which they denyed, Chap. 23.8. the Priests, because they being private men, went about to teach the people; and chiefly, because they preached the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection through Jesus.</p>

                        <p>The 5000 mentioned here, were the number of Converts, and not of Auditors; and they were a single number by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and not an addition to the 3000 mentioned before, to make them five thousand.</p>
                        <p>For, first, the holy Ghost intendeth in this booke to shew the power of the Gospel, rather then the bare preaching of it, and how many it converted, rather then how many heard it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the juncture of the verse is so close and facil that none can understand it any otherwise then of the number of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, unlesse it be for very captiousnesse; for the Text saith, that <hi>many of them that heard the word beleeved.</hi> And how many was that many? Namely, 5000 men.</p>
                        <p>For, thirdly, how ridiculous were it to interpret that the holy Ghost should tell us, that there was an audience in the Temple of 5000 men? Why, <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, every course of the Priests contained so many: And it would bee utterly strange, if the holy Ghost, which in all the Bible never numbred an audience at the Temple, no, not when he was intentionally writing of the service and assembly there, should doe it now when hee is purposely upon a story of men converted to the Gospel.</p>
                        <p>Again, that this is an intire summe different from the 3000 in the second Chapter, is plaine by the very story in hand.</p>
                        <p>For, first, it is a discourse concerning a miracle done by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi>; and all the Chapter to the three and twentyeth verse, keepes close to that relation: and what reason possibly bly can be given, that this clause onely should start from it.</p>

                           <pb n="62" facs="tcp:59068:42"/>Secondly, it were an uncouth manner of reckoning, and such as the Scripture is utterly unacquainted with, to number 5000, and to meane but 2000; and never to give any notice that it so meaneth.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>The number of the men were</hi> 5000. Of what men? <hi>Of those which heard the word.</hi> What word? The word preached by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> vers. 1. and not the word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched on Pentecost day by all the Apostles. Thus is the Church become 8000 numerous by two Sermons; besides the multitudes that were beleevers before, and those whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version is not summed.</p>

this very passage to give us close intimation, that every Psalme that telleth not in its title who was the author and Penman of it, is to bee ascribed to <hi>David</hi> as the Penman. The rule of the Jews (<hi>that every Psalme that beares not the author of it in the title, is to bee reputed of his making who was last named in a title before</hi>) is at a <hi>nonplus</hi> at these two first Psalmes, and helpes us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to understand who made them: and thereupon <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> conceiveth not that this second Psalme was made by <hi>David,</hi> but by some of the Singers.

                           <p>For first, the thing was not done by command, but at the free disposall of whosoever was minded so to doe, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.4.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the Lands that were sold, were many of them out of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi>; for the converts were Jewes from all Nations, &amp; one instance is given in the Land of <hi>Barnabas</hi> in <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi>; now when these men were resolved to cleave to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and not to return to their own Countrey; what good would their Lands in those forain Countries do them?</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, if these Lands and Houses were in <hi>Iudea,</hi> as it is undoubted many of them were, it may bee supposed that the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59068:44"/>
faithfull owners thereof tooke notice of the threatned destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> spoken of by our Saviour, and so would part with their estates for the benefit of the Church, before they should bee surprized by the enemy.</p>
                           <p>And fourthly, thus did God provide against persecution to come; that neither the poore of the Church should fall off through penury, nor the rich start back through worldy mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse; but by a competent distribution among them, the one might have enough, and the other not too much.</p>
                           <p>And lastly, such was the state of the Church at this time, as never was the like to be again. It was but newly borne, it was all in one City, the most of the people far resident from their own houses, all in a possibility to bee scattered by persecution, they could not tell how soon: and therefore that present ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Church in such a case, cannot bee any copy for times to come either to follow as a command, or to imitate as a perfection.</p>
                           <p>This very yeare was a Jubilee among the Jewes in the very proper sense, it being the eight and twentyeth that the Land had had since their setling in it: and these people now conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Gospel, are so farre from returning to their possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if they had sold or morgaged them, as the Jubilee priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, that they part with their possessions that they had in their hands; having by this time learned that the earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> and inheritance, was not that possession that was to bee looked after, and that the Kingdome of the <hi>Messias</hi> should not be earthly.</p>

                        <p>First, it is understood by <hi>Beza</hi> of such as were as yet out of the Church, and yet not strangers to the Kingdome of God, but such as for feare durst not shew themselves, either because of the Jewes, or because of the judgement afflicted on <hi>Ananias.</hi>

                        <p>Secondly, it may be understood of those that were within the Church, yet durst not joyne themselves in consistory or Presbyteriall societie with the 120. Disciples, but kept their distance in regard of judging, though they knit with them in communion.</p>
                        <p>Or thirdly, it may be understood of the 108.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59068:45"/>
the very meaning of the place, and that upon these grounds.</p>
                        <p>First, because the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> seemeth to import a residue or the rest of their owne company, and not the people that were out of the Church, for of them it had beene more proper to have said <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, as the skilfull in the Greeke language will readily judge.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the joyning here spoken of in regard of the object to whom, is to the Apostles, and not to the Church, as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent by the very Grammaticall construction.</p>
                        <p>Especially, thirdly, the word <gap reason="foreign">

And so the sense of all redounds to this; that besides that terrible and dreadfull worke that was done by <hi>Peter</hi> upon <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> all the other eleven Apostles did great and wondrous miracles among the people, and the whole Colledge and Presbytery of the 120. were unanimously in <hi>Solomons</hi> Porch joyning together in association and advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospel, but the rest of the 120. durst not one of them joyne themselves to the twelve in the peculiar office and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Apostleship properly so called, having seene so lately the dreadfull judgement that one of the twelve had brought upon <hi>Ananias</hi> one of their owne number, and seeing the continuall wonders that they did in an extraordinary manner among the people, howbeit the people magnified them also, they also having the admirable and wondrous gifts of the Spirit upon them.</p>

                           <p>Many miracles were wrought by the Apostles hands, and many as it seemeth by <hi>Peters</hi> shadow: but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Text hath left it so indifferent, that it is hard to determine whether it is to be taken in a good sense or a bad, and indeed some that have taken it the better way have made it the worst of all. <hi>Luke</hi> saith
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59068:46"/>
onely thus, <hi>They brought forth the sicke into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.</hi> But it neither telleth who they were that laid them, nor a word at all that those were healed that were laid. And it may be thought they were unbeleeving Jewes that laid them as well as otherwise: for beleevers might have brought them to the Apostles, or brought the Apostles to them: And it may possibly bee thought that they laid them there either out of a superstitious blindnesse, thinking his sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to be miraculous as well as his person, or out of a chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting perversnesse, thinking to gaine by his power though they would none of his doctrine: and that none of their sicke were healed because there is no mention of any such healing at all. If wee should thus understand the story, surely wee should doe lesse wrong to the Text, and to our owne understandings then some have done that have taken it in a better sense. For be it, that God intending to magnifie <hi>Peter</hi> the minister of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision in the eyes of the circumcised, did give him a more extraordinary power of miracles, for their sakes that stood upon miracles so much, so that not onely himselfe, but his shadow also could heale diseases, yet how ridiculous and senselesse is that which <hi>Baronius</hi> would infer hereupon, namely, That <hi>Peter</hi> therefore was Prince of all the Apostles: and that therefore the shadowes or images of holy men are of holy use and religious worship, and that the Pope who is <hi>Peters</hi> shadow and representation hath <hi>Peters</hi> power and qualification?</p>

                        <p>Secondly, that the miscariages of these two men that hee instanceth in, proceeded from two different and dangerous principles; pretence of new lights and revelations; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of liberty of conscience and of persons. <hi>Theudas</hi> was for the former, <hi>Iudas</hi> for the latter.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, that <hi>Gamaliels</hi> counsell was not of any Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie that was in him, but of policy, not that hee favored the Apostles, but that hee feared if any thing were done to them by violence or injustice, it might incurre a <hi>Premunire</hi> or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; and that is apparent, in that all the Councell consent and entertaine his counsell.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, that <hi>Gamaliels Theudas</hi> and <hi>Iosephus</hi> his is not all one: their descriptions indeed are very agreeable, for as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel</hi> saith that <hi>Theudas</hi> tooke on him <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>to bee some body,</hi> of note and eminency, so doth the relation about the <hi>Theudas</hi> in <hi>Iosephus. Simon Magus</hi> boasted himselfe <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> to bee some speciall person, Act. 8.9. and how did hee carry on this arrogation? why, by magick and doing some strange things among the people: and just in the same kind hath <hi>Iosephus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed his <hi>Theudas,</hi> but yet these two <hi>Theudases</hi> seeme not to bee the same.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="75" facs="tcp:59068:48"/>Fiftly, for <hi>Iosephus</hi> setting the story of his <hi>Theudas</hi> so late as in the time of <hi>Claudius,</hi> a dozen yeares or thereabouts after this speech of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> [although it might bee said it is no strange thing with <hi>Iosephus</hi> to misplace stories, and to faulter in point of exact Chronology, as <hi>Baronius</hi> supposeth hee hath done in this] yet seemeth it rather to bee upon the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive propriety of the time of the story: And the matter to bee conceived thus, that as Sects and heresies, though buried, yet doe oft revive, and though dispersed, yet doe recollect: and being once begun are not suddenly extinguished, but like quenched fire are ever breaking out in one place or other, that so it was with this businesse of <hi>Theudas.</hi> And so also it may bee instanced in the very sect and opinion of him that <hi>Gamaliel</hi> speaketh of immediatly after, namely <hi>Iudas of Galilee</hi>: Hee rose up in the dayes of the tax in the time of <hi>Augustus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hee pleaded against the Jewes being subject to the Romans, and disswaded them from paying taxes and tribute to them: and maintained they ought to have no ruler over them but God: and so became the originall of a fourth sect among the Jewes, besides the Pharisees, Sadduces and Esseans, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> reports of him. <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 18. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. and <hi>de Bell. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. Now though <hi>Iudas</hi> himselfe perished in his errour, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as obeyed him were scattered abroad, as <hi>Gamaliel</hi> relateth, yet was not his error extinguished with him, but revived and grew againe: So that at the least 40. yeares after his first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, his two sonnes <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Simon</hi> are crucified for it by <hi>Tiberius Alexander,</hi> the successor of <hi>Fadus. Ios. Antiq. lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. And many yeares after that, <hi>Eleazer</hi> a branch of the same <hi>Iudas</hi> appeareth in the same opinion with a desperate compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with him, <hi>De bel. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 30.</p>
                        <p>Even so may it bee conceived of the Sect of <hi>Theudas</hi>: that it began before that of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and that the first author of it tooke upon him great things, as to bee a Prophet, and to worke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and the like, but he was soone slaine and all that obeyed him were scattered abroad and came to nought. But his folly and fancy perished not with him, but [however at other times] in the time of <hi>Fadus</hi> one of the same foolery and name, and probably his sonne, would bee a Prophet againe and divide
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59068:49"/>
                           <hi>Iordan</hi> and doe I know not what, whom <hi>Fadus</hi> destroyed and brought his company to ruine. So that <hi>Gamaliels</hi> and <hi>Iosephus his Theudas,</hi> are very probably two men, but very likely father &amp; sonne, or tutor and scholler, agreeing so jumpe in the same folly and madnesse that they agreed in the same name: and that name either given to the latter at such an accidency as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents name their children, or assumed by him in imitation of the former <hi>Theudas,</hi> whom as hee delighted to imitate in his Enthusiastick folly, so delighted hee to follow him in denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And I am the rather confirmed in this opinion about these two men, because that as soone as ever <hi>Iosephus</hi> hath told the story of the destruction of <hi>Theudas</hi> by <hi>Fadus,</hi> hee tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth of the destruction of the sonnes of <hi>Iudas,</hi> by <hi>Tiberius Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and I cannot but interpret both the stories in one sense, that as in the latter hee speaketh of the off-spring of <hi>Iudas,</hi> whose sect had begun many years before, so in the former hee speaketh of the off-spring of <hi>Theudas,</hi> whose sect had begun before that of <hi>Iudas.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The carriage of <hi>Tarquin</hi> the last of the Kings had brought the Citie into an opinion <hi>that monarchy was an enemy to liberty:</hi> And the growth and flourishing of that State under another manner of government had so confirmed this opinion, that they were sooner put out of their liberty, then out of beleefe of that position. <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Collatinus,</hi> who were the expellers of <hi>Tarquin</hi> and of Monarchy with him, had found out a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment likely enough in all humane judgement to heale all these mischiefes and miscarriages, that monarchicall tyranny did bring upon them, when they appointed two supreme gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours in stead of one, and their power and rule to bee but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall in stead of, for life. The successe was agreeable to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, and so happily and prosperously did the State grow under these rulers, [and some others mixt as occasion urged], that to offer to reduce it to a Monarchy againe, was infallibly held to bee, to reduce it to slavery; and <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> found how deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded this opinion was in the heart of a <hi>Roman,</hi> by the losse of his life: they supposing his affecting the Empire single, aimed at the losse of their liberties.</p>

some have beene undone for agreeing to his words, because they agreed not to his mind: and some have beene undone for agreeing to his mind, because hee perceived they had found his mind out.

                     <p>This dissimulation hee began withall at his very first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to the Empire, pretending great unwillingnesse to take it upon him, and when it was urged on him past deniall, then pret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The same dissimulation hee tooke along with him, when hee had taken the Empire on him, carrying it with all mildnesse and moderation, as if hee had beene a second <hi>Augustus,</hi> whereas indeed the reason was, because <hi>Germanicus</hi> was alive, and most deare in the peoples affection, and hee feared him lest hee should have beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before him.</p>
                     <p>Yet did his best demeanour bewray what hee was within, for all his skill in dissembling, and at the very best hee gave just suspition that hee would prove but evill.</p>
                     <p>Hee began his reigne with the murder of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> a man once in as high favour with <hi>Augustus</hi> as himselfe. Hee went on with the murder of a poore man for a peece of wit: For as a corpse was carried to its interring, this man can to it and whispered in the dead mans eare: and being asked by the standers by what hee meant, hee answered, that hee desired that dead man when he came into the other world, to tell <hi>Augustus</hi> that his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies to the people were not yet paid. This cost the poore man his life, for <hi>Tiberius</hi> said he should go on that message himself, and so hee slew him, but this got the people their Legacies.</p>
                     <p>It would be infinite to reckon up the murders, oppressions, and miscreancy committed by him in the first seventeene yeers of his raigne, or before this yeare that wee have in hand: The most remarkable were that hee raised <hi>Sejanus</hi> purposely that hee might helpe to ruine <hi>Germanicus</hi> and <hi>Drusus,</hi> though they
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59068:52"/>
were his owne adopted sonnes, and when that was done by <hi>Sejanus</hi> hee ruined <hi>Sejanus</hi> and all his friends with him.

For whereas <hi>Iohn</hi> began to baptize about the vernall Equinox, and Christ was not baptized till the Autumnall, beginning just then to enter upon his thirtieth yeare, and whereas <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> began to reigne about the 18. day of <hi>August,</hi> as appeareth by the Roman Historians, the fifteenth yeare of <hi>Tiberius</hi> in exact accounting was expired some weekes before Christ was baptized. And therefore though <hi>Luke</hi> say that in the fifteenth yeare of <hi>Tiberius Iohn</hi> came baptizing, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.1. yet was it in the 16. yeare of <hi>Tiberius</hi> (as it seemeth) before Christ came to his baptisme: and so should the death of our Saviour fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Tiberius</hi> his 19. yeare. But it is not safe to hang the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie of all succeeding times upon so small a pin as this: therefore according to the universall consent and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Christian writers, wee will take the 18 yeare of <hi>Tiberius</hi> to have beene the yeare of Christs death, resurrection, and ascension, and accordingly compute and reckon the times of the succeeding Emperours that wee have to goe through proportionate or agreeable to this beginning.</p>
                     <p>The Roman Consuls for this yeare that wee have in hand were <hi>Cn. Domitius</hi> and <hi>Camillus Scribonianus,</hi> as is obvious to any eye that counteth, and the yeare and Consuls in the time of <hi>Tiberius.</hi>

Domitius <hi>and</hi> Camillus Scribonianus <hi>were Consuls (which was the yeare wee have in hand) a thing most ridiculous came to passe. For whereas it had beene decreed long before, that the Senate should not sweare to the acts of the Emperour on the first day of Ianuary, man by man, but that one should take the oath, and the rest should give their consent: this yeare they did not so, but of their owne offer, and no one constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they were sworne every man in particular.</hi>

                           <hi>And there befell also a thing yet more ridiculous then this.

A far milder nature then his, would hardly have missed to have made a domineering use of such an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie, when their visible hatred had shewed him his owne danger, and their cowardly flattery had shewed him his power, and how hee made advantage of these his notions, did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the sequell.</p>

the Senate so officious and serviceable to him, as to condemne and execute. And happy had the condition of the Citie been, had hee rested there, to have beene accuser onely himselfe, but his subtle policy had found out a way, and practised it, and hee thought himselfe happy in it, to set such division and sow such seeds of accusations among the people, that now they doe nothing, nor affect nothing more, then to accuse, impeach and charge one another, and to contrive and compasse each others death. Cruell and inhumane that hee was thus to divide and imbroile his owne people and Subjects to destroy each other, that the clearer way might bee made to his tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny through their destruction; and that hee cannot thinke himselfe an absolute Prince, nor truely happy, unlesse his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple die at his pleasure or live in misery. Yet can I not but thinke of an invisible hand of justice in this deplorate condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Citie and State wrought and brought upon her by her owne Prince, that shee now perisheth daily and sadly by her false accusing, and condemning, and destroying one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; for at this very time, by false accusation and unjust condemning, shee had destroyed and murdered the Lord of life.</p>

almost common madnesse of accusing, which more tormented the gowned Citie, then all their civill warres had done before. Now the words of drunkards were catched at, and the harmelesnesse of jesters.

                     <p>In the sports and feasts of <hi>Flora,</hi> this <hi>Seianus</hi> being Pretor, had caused all things to bee performed by baldheaded men,<note place="margin">

                        </note> hee caused five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand boyes with their heads shaven bare, to carry Linkes and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59068:55"/>
Torches to light them away. And yet <hi>Tiberius</hi> would take no notice of all this though hee knew it well enough, either because hee would not second his owne derision, by taking it to heart, or because hee intended to revenge this scorne at some other time, under some other title, or because by this tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hee would animate more to bee saucy with him to their owne confusion.</p>
                     <p>But far more brave, because far more necessary and discreet, was the courage of <hi>Terentius,</hi> who had the sober and well gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded valour, not to thrust himselfe into danger, but to bring him out. Hee was accused of dependence upon <hi>Sejanus,</hi> and of complying with him, and he denied not the accusation, but strengthned it, and came off better by extremitie of confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then others could doe with the utmost of excusing. <hi>I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> said hee, <hi>and honoured Sejanus, because Tiberius loved him and did him honour: So that if hee did well I did not amisse, and if the Emperour that knoweth all things exactly, were deceived, it is no wonder if I were d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To annalize therefore the story of this booke of the <hi>Acts,</hi> as it cannot but prove a matter of great difficulty,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59068:60"/>
so will it prove but a matter of conjecture when wee have done what wee can, and both these proceed from this ground and reason, because the holy Ghost hath beene very sparing, if not utterly silent, in giving account of the times in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the death of Christ forward, that great businesse in his death being accomplished and fulfilled, for which alone the succession of times was reckoned and recorded: wee shall therefore in the casting of passages and occurrences into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall yeares, as wee goe along present them under their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notion of conjecture, yet shewing some groundwork and reason of what wee doe: and though it may be we may not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hit aright, in fixing every thing to its proper yeare, yet hope wee to finde here and there some such maine pins as whereon to hang a summe of divers yeares joyned together, and to settle them fast, although wee cannot so perfectly find a generall naile whereby to fasten the occurrences of every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall yeare by it selfe.</p>
                     <p>Wee may take an instance in the story at which wee now are, the choosing of the seven Deacons: It is not possible, posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to determine at what time this was done, it may bee it was before the three and thirtieth yeare of our Saviour was expired, namely before <hi>September</hi> next after his Ascension, it may be again it was not before <hi>September,</hi> but betwixt it and <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> next following, or it may be it was not before <hi>Ianuary,</hi> but after it, in this yeare that wee are entring upon: there is a like uncertainty in all these things, if wee should come to try the times of this particular thing by it selfe, but when wee shall come to examine and take up the time of <hi>Pauls</hi> conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then will some steadinesse of the time of this appeare, and the naile that fastneth that, will so clench up all the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries betwixt that and the descension of the holy Ghost, or all the stories from the end of the second Chapter to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ninth, that they will not hang altogether loose, but have some fixednesse to their proper time.</p>

Whether Greeks that were converted to the Jewish Religion, or Jewes that used the Greeke tongue; but the latter seemeth to bee the proper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it upon these grounds.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. Because the very forme of the word <hi>Hellenista</hi> doth more properly import a Jew ingraffed into the Greeks, then a Greek ingraffed into the Jewes.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Because whereas <hi>Iudeus</hi> and <hi>Hellen</hi> distinguish the two nations <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> all along in the Scripture, <hi>Hebraeus</hi> and <hi>Hellenista</hi> must needs signifie something else here.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Because if by <hi>Hellenistae</hi> had beene meant the converted Greekes, it had beene most proper in contradistinction to them to have said <gap reason="foreign">

Because the story from the beginning of this booke hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maketh the Church to consist most especially of Jewes, as Ch. 2.5.22. and 3.12. and though it mention proselytes among them, yet seemeth it most improbable that their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber should be so great as to have seven Deacons chosen for them.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Because <hi>Nicolas</hi> one of the seven, is expressely called <hi>a Proselyte of Antioch,</hi> which had beene somewhat improper if all the businesse had onely concerned Proselytes.</p>

of the situation of their dwellings; but chiefely in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from the Easterne captivities carried away by the Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and Persians: and also because they used Westerne tongues. And to this sense it soundeth when it is said <hi>the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenists murmured against the Hebrews</hi>: namely that both they that murmured and they that were murmured against were Jewes, but the one party called Hebrewes and the other Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenists in reference to their language and residence. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes in <hi>Iudea</hi> or in the countries of the Easterne dispersion, and the other in the countries and Colonies of the Westerne. And in this sense is that easily understood which is spoken of <hi>Paul,</hi> Chap. 9.29. that <hi>he spake and questioned with the Hellenists,</hi> namely, because hee spake their language, the Greeke tongue, hee being borne in <hi>Tarsus,</hi> where they had Greeke Schooles, And that in Chap. 11.19.20. <hi>They that were scattered spake the word to none but to the Iewes onely,</hi> and yet some spake to the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenists at <hi>Antioch,</hi> they that spake being themselves Hellenists by birth, or Jewes borne in <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Cyrene,</hi> in Greeke co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and so dealt with them of <hi>Antioch</hi> that were of the same native reference that they were.</p>

                              </gap>; for as the occasion of their election was complaint of the poore, so the end of their choice was to provide for their reliefe. It is true indeed that these seven men, at the least two of them, <hi>Stephen</hi> &amp; <hi>Philip,</hi> were prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Word as well as overseers of the poore: but this their ministeriall function they had before their Deaconry, and not with it. For it is not onely the opinion of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> but even sense and reason do give their vote with him, that these men were of the number of the Seventy, or at the least of the 108. that had beene Christs constant followers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples: and so had received their ministeriall function from
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59068:62"/>
Christ and not from the Apostles, and it was not an addition to their Deaconry, but their Deaconry to it: For the Text tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth plainely that <hi>they were full of the holy Ghost</hi> before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the imposition of hands, and so had in all probabilitie, yea indeed past deniall, received the holy Ghost when the 120. did, they being some of that number.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Those tables for which the office of Deaconry was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, were not holy Tables but common. For 1. The twelve set an inconsistency betweene serving these Tables, and preaching the Word, <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. which they would never have done, if serving of Tables had beene the attending upon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper. 2. The serving of Tables that they meane, they put over from themselves to the Deacons, but none can thinke that they would ever resigne or give over the administring the Sacrament. 3. There were Ministers enow already for the administration and attending upon the Sacrament, and there needed no new ordination or office for it.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The office of the Deacons was to take care of the poore according to their severall wants; to gather and receive col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections for them, to distribute to them, to oversee them, and to minister to them in their necessities, and therefore it is no wonder if the Apostles were so circumspect in their election, and so observant in their ordination. For these seven were to take this worke of the Apostles out of their hands, and to dispose of the stock of the Church, and upon whose care the support of the poore was to depend, and their welfare upon their incorruption, and then it is no marvell if they were chosen men of good report: and they were to converse with varietie of languages and nations, and therefore it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full they should bee <hi>full of the holy Ghost,</hi> inabling them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with them in their divers tongues.</p>

And in <hi>Hebron Iosephus</hi> would have all the sonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi> buried likewise, <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. and by his report they were buried there before <hi>Ioseph,</hi> for that they were brought thither as they died, but <hi>Iosephs</hi> buriall was put over, till all the nation came out of <hi>Egypt</hi>: Now it is not to bee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that <hi>Stephen,</hi> a man so full of the holy Ghost, would ever have spoken a thing in which every ordinary man, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or child that heard him, could so easily have confuted him, as they might have done if the twelve Patriarks had been buried in <hi>Hebron,</hi> much lesse when hee spake to the Councell and to men of learning and understanding, that would readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have tript him, if hee had faltered in so plaine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a story: therefore it is past all doubting, that <hi>Shechem</hi> was knownly and generally reputed the place of the Patriarks buriall: For as, although there bee mention onely of <hi>Moses</hi> bringing up the bones of <hi>Ioseph, Exod.</hi> 13.19. yet <hi>R. Solomon</hi> well observeth that <hi>wee may learne from that very place that the bones of all the Patriarks were brought up with him</hi>: so though there bee mention of the buriall of <hi>Ioseph</hi> onely in <hi>Sichem, Iosh.</hi> 24.32. and no record of the buriall of the rest of the twelve there: yet might it very well bee supposed had not <hi>Stephen</hi> asserted it that they were also buried there with him. For as wee may prove the bringing of their bones out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> yea though <hi>Stephen</hi> had not told it;</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="109" facs="tcp:59068:65"/>For, 1. The same cause that moved <hi>Ioseph</hi> to desire buriall in the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> could not but move the other of the twelve to desire the like: were it in faith in the promise, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the interest in the Land, or in hope of the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all the rest had the very same principles to move them to it that <hi>Ioseph</hi> had.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The rest of the Tribes bare the same honour to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks, that the Tribe of <hi>Ioseph</hi> did to him, and therefore if they, in honour to <hi>Ioseph</hi> would preserve his bones (that at their remoovall, they might bee taken out of <hi>Egypt</hi>) the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the rest of the Tribes would do so by their Patriarks also.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To which might bee added the kind of necessitie which there was that the twelve fathers of the Church of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and heires of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> should have their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terment in that Land, and not be left in the land of bondage.</p>
                        <p>So likewise may there bee arguments sufficient to prove that they were buried with his bones in <hi>Sichem.</hi> As 1. There was no reason they should bee severed in the buriall who had been united in their removall. 2. <hi>Iosephs</hi> bones were most regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, and the same Sepulcher that served him, would have best befit them. 3. The convocation of all <hi>Israel</hi> by <hi>Ioshua</hi> was <hi>Sichem,</hi> and there, upon their possessing of the land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee makes a covenant betwixt them and God, and it is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably more probable that they should bury the bones of all the Patriarks there, then in <hi>Hebron,</hi> where wee doe not read that <hi>Ioshua</hi> ever came but to destroy the Citie.</p>
                        <p>Now the reason why <hi>Stephen</hi> speaking of the burials of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> and his sonnes which were in distant and different places, doth yet couch their story so close together, as if they were all laid together in the same place, is,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Because treating of two numbers so unequall, as twelve and one, hee first followeth the story of the greater number.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Hee useth the singular number for the plurall, <hi>Sepulcher</hi> for <hi>Sepulchers,</hi> which is a thing so common, as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59068:66"/>
is more common in the Scripture Language.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Hee useth an <hi>Ellipsis</hi> or cutting off of the conjunction <hi>Vau</hi> or <hi>And,</hi> which also is exceeding common in the same Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Psal.</hi> 133.3. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.8. and divers other places.</p>
                        <p>So that though hee spake so very curt and short as hee did, yet to them that were well enough acquainted, both with the story it selfe, and with such Hebraismes, his shortnesse would breed no obscuritie, but they would readily take him in this sense: <hi>And Iacob and our fathers died, and were removed to Sichem, and were laid in Sepulchers, in that which Abraham bought for money, and in that that was bought from the sonnes of Emmor, the father of Sichem.</hi>

                        <p n="2">II. Now the fixing of this time when <hi>Israel</hi> tooke up this Idolatry is somewhat difficult: It is some facilitating of the matter if wee can bee sure it was not in the forty yeares in the Wildernesse: And that appeares to bee so, by the very scope of <hi>Stevens</hi> speech: for 1. hee telleth that they made a golden calfe in the Verse before: and that God for this Idolatry gave them up to worship all the host of heaven: whereupon it is evident, that this Idolatry with the calfe, was neither of these mentioned in this Verse, neither with <hi>Moloch</hi> nor <hi>Remphan:</hi> but as it were a cause of these, for for it the Lord gave them up to these. 2.

In neglect of Gods own service in the wildernesse, <hi>yee offered mee no sacrifice for fortie yeares.</hi> And 2. in their choosing of Idols to worship afterward.

                        <p>These seven Chappels (if there bee truth in the thing) helpe us to understand, what is meant by <hi>Molechs Tabernacle,</hi> and seeme to give some reason why in the Prophet he is called <hi>Sic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuth,</hi> or the <hi>Covert God,</hi> because he was retired within so many <hi>Cancelli,</hi> (for that word <hi>Kimchi</hi> useth) before one could come at him.

King. Now <hi>Molech</hi> or <hi>Moloch,</hi> or <hi>Milchom</hi> or <hi>Malcham</hi> (for all these names are but one and the same) was also called <hi>Baal</hi> in a speciall and distinctive sense, as is apparent by <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.31. and 19.5. compared together: and this consideration helpeth to understand divers places where the word <hi>Baal</hi> is singly used, as 1 <hi>King.</hi> 16.31 32. and 18.19, &amp;c. And according to this sense should I understand the matter of <hi>Baal-peor</hi> in which <hi>Israel</hi> was joyned to him, to have been sacrificing their children to <hi>Molech.</hi> And answerably should I interpret that speech of the Psalmist, <hi>They are the sacrifices of the dead, Psal.</hi> 106.28. that is, sacrifices offered up when they offered up their children to bee burnt: And this was the first time, they committed this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid idolatry in the very close of the forty yeares in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, in which 40. yeares they had not cared to offer any sacrifices to God: And this abomination with <hi>Molech</hi> they committed also presently after they were come into the Land, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.35, 36, 37. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2.13.</p>
                        <p n="4">IIII. [<hi>And the Star of your God Remphan.</hi>] Here is the maine difficulty of this Verse, and that not onely in regard of the difference of these words of <hi>Stephen</hi> from those of <hi>Amos,</hi> but also in regard of the obscuritie of the matter it selfe: <hi>Amos</hi> readeth thus: <hi>Chijim your Images, the starre of your God</hi>: Now the question in the first place is, what is meant by <hi>Chijim,</hi> and it may bee scrupled whether it bee the proper name of an Idol as some thinke, or a word appellative, to another sense: <hi>I</hi> should rather take it the latter way [although I know general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is construed for an Idols name, either for <hi>Hercules,</hi> who among the Egyptians was called <hi>Chon</hi>: or for <hi>Saturne,</hi> who among the Arabians was called <hi>Chevan,</hi> as see <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> on <hi>Amos,</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> on this place.]</p>
                        <p>For there are two things in this passage of <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Amos</hi> very considerable toward the understanding of this place.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That <hi>Stephen</hi> saith, God gave them up to worship <hi>all the host</hi> of heaven: now if <hi>Chijim</hi> betoken but one Idol, or one Planet, this commeth very short of the intent that hee aimeth at, their worshipping of all.</p>

                           <p>Out of the darkenesse of persecution, the Lord bringeth forth the light &amp; the propagation of the Gospel: Providing at once for the safetie of some by their flight, and for the calling home of many more by their dispersion. <hi>At that time,</hi> saith <hi>Luke, there was a great persecution against the Church that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was at Ierusalem, and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Iudea and Samaria except the Apostles.</hi> Where, as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Apostles in the very centre of the tyranny is admirable, so the scattering of the other into their severall places is considerable. For that they travailed into <hi>Iudea</hi> and <hi>Samaria, Damascus, Phenicia, Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> the text is plaine in this and in other places, but since it mentioneth none of their journeyes any further, what is said of them more, is but groundlesse conjectures, or rather ridiculous fables. For though it were granted that they scattered through other countries of the Heathen, yet to bring them as far as to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> as some doe, is almost as farre from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as these places are distant from Jerusalem, unlesse some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause can be alleadged of this their flight then to avoid the danger. Yes, it it may bee said they tooke so long a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to preach the Gospel; but 1. the Text saith that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed preached to the Jewes onely, of which I beleeve these countries afforded a very small number. And 2. the legend saith, that <hi>Mary Magdalen, Martha</hi> and <hi>Ioseph of Arimathea</hi> and others were the travailers, who where they had a calling to the ministery is yet to seeke.</p>
                           <p>These persons and others with them are driven by the blast of a common report, to <hi>Marseils</hi> in <hi>France, Aix</hi> in <hi>Province, Glasenbury</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and I know not whither.

not worth thy labour.

Here E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy thinketh it hath an undeniable Argument for proofe of its Hierarchy, and of the strange rite of confirmation. For thus pleadeth <hi>Baronius</hi> for the former. <hi>From hence,</hi> saith hee, <hi>it may bee seene that the Hierarchicall order was instituted in the Church of God even in this time; for Philip doth so baptize those that beleeve, that yet hee usurpeth not the Apostolicall priviledge, namely the imposition of hands granted to the Apostles.</hi> And thus the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists both for it and for the latter in their notes on Act. 8.17. <hi>If this Philip had beene an Apostle, saith S. Bede, hee might have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed his hands that they might have received the Holy Ghost, but this none can doe saving Bishops. For though Priests may baptize and annoint the baptized also with Chrisme consecrated by a Bishop, yet can hee not signe his forehead with the same holy oyle, because that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth onely to Bishops, when they give the holy Ghost to the baptized. And after this testimony of Bede they subjoyne their owne inference. This imposition therefore of hands, together with the prayers here spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified (which no doubt was the very same that the Church useth to that purpose) was the ministration of the Sacrament of Confirmation.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now let the Reader with indifferency and seriousnesse but ruminate upon these two Queries, and then judge of those two inferences;</p>
                           <p>First, whether Apostleship were not an Order for ever, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable in the Church: for besides the Reason given to prove that it was, upon the choosing of <hi>Matthias,</hi> others may bee
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59068:72"/>
added to make it the more cleare: As 1. the end of their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was peculiar, the like to which was not to bee in the Church againe; for they were chosen to bee with Christ, <hi>Marke</hi> 3.14. to bee eye-witnesses of his resurrection, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.22. &amp; 2.32. &amp; 10.41. as they had been of his actions and passion, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.2. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> pleading for his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stleship, useth this argument from a property necessary for an Apostle, That <hi>hee had seene the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.1. and in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or story of his calling, this particular is singularly added, That <hi>hee saw that just one, and heard the voice of his mouth, Act.</hi> 22.14.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the name of <hi>Apostles</hi> keepeth it selfe unmixed or confounded, with any other Order. It is true indeed that the significancy of the word would agree to other Ministers that are sent to preach, but there is a peculiar propriety in the sense that hath confined the title to the twelve &amp; <hi>Paul,</hi> as any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different eye will judge and censure upon the weighing of it in the New Testament.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, when <hi>Paul</hi> reckoneth the severall kinds of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery that Christ left in the Church at his ascension, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.11. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. there is none that can thinke them all to bee perpetuated, or that they should continue successively in the like order from time to time: For within an hundred yeeres after our Saviours birth, where were either Prophets or Evangelists, miracles or healings? And if these extraordinary kinds of ministration were ordained but for a time and for speciall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and were not to be imitated in the Church unto succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding times; much more, or at the least as much, were the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, an Order much more, at least, as much extraordinary as they.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, the constant and undeniable Parallel which is made betwixt the twelve Patriarchs the Fathers of the twelve Tribes, and the twelve Apostles, not onely by the number it selfe, but also by the New Testament in the fou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59068:72"/>
as unimitable as the first. These things well considered, if there were no more, it will shew how improbable and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant the first inference is, that is alledged, that because there was such a subordination betwixt the Apostles and <hi>Philip</hi>; that therefore the like is to bee reputed betwixt Bishops and other Mini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>A second <hi>Quaere,</hi> and very materiall to the matter in agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, wheth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> indifferently given to all (for it is good cheape) that this act of the Apostles aimed not, nor intended to any such thing, may bee reasonably conjectured and guessed at by these considerations:</p>
                           <p>First, that the holy Ghost thus given, meaneth not his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary worke of sanctification and confirming in Grace, but his extraordinary gifts, of Tongues, Prophecying, and the like. And this is evident by the meaning of that Phrase <hi>the holy Ghost</hi> in the Scriptures, (when it denoteth not exactly the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the holy Ghost, or the third Person in the Trinity) For as it is a Rabbinick expression, very common in the writings of the Jewes, and in the use of the Nation; and evermore in their use and sense meaneth only the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit mentioned: so doth it constantly signifie in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and it is very hard, if not utterly impossible to find it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying any other sense.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, it is yet more evident by the very historicall relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Luke</hi> concerning the matter in hand; for in <hi>Acts</hi> 19.6. telling how <hi>Paul</hi> laid his hands upon certaine men at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and they received the holy Ghost, hee instantly explaineth what were the gifts of the holy Ghost that they received, for <hi>they spake with tongues,</hi> saith hee, <hi>and prophecyed.</hi> And it is not possible to thinke but that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> (when hee offered mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59068:73"/>
for this fruit of the imposition of his hands; that he might give the holy Ghost) saw some visible apparent signe of the gift by the hands of the Apostles, which if it were onely san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying or confirming grace, how could hee have seene it? So did they of the Circumcision perceive when the gifts of the holy Ghost fell upon the Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.45. For they saw it by their speaking with tongues, and magnifying God, <hi>ver.</hi> 46.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, it being then thus undeniable that the gifts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by the imposition of hands, were the extraordinary ones of the holy Ghost; it can as little also bee denyed that they were imparted onely to some singular and particular persons, and not to all whatsoever without distinction. For otherwise, 1. It must bee granted that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> received them as well as others, which I know not who will grant; for by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with <hi>Philip</hi> and the Apostles (hee having also beene baptized with the rest, and his wickednesse and his villany not yet broken forth) hee might have gotten a precedency in this gift before others, if it had been generall.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. It would bring Women under imposition of hands, which can hardly be dreamed of, or ever was of any one. It is true indeed that women might, &amp; did receive some of these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts, but it was by immediate influence from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and not by any imposition of hands.</p>
                           <p>So that now if wee looke upon this Story, and upon others of the like nature, through these spectacles, it will appeare that this Imposition of the Apostles hands was not upon all the Samaritans, but upon some selected number, nor upon those selected ones for their confirmation in grace, but for their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to the Ministery, and with the imposition of hands they received the holy Ghost to inable them for that work.</p>

                        <p>This Prophecy of <hi>Esay</hi> which the Eunuch was reading, is exceedingly much mistaken by the Jewes, and this clause of the Prophecy is exceedingly controverted among Christians.

                        <p n="1">1. That the most notorious persecutor that the Gospel had yet found, is chosen of all others to bee the Doctor of the Gentiles: that even his owne example, or rather the glorious example of Gods mercy in his conversion, might bee a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable doctrine to those notorious sinners of the Gentiles as well as his preaching.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That the like divine violence was never used for the converting of a sinner either before or since: but 1. it was necessary that hee should see Christ, as Vers. 17. because it was a necessary ingredient toward the making of an Apostle, <hi>to have seene the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.1. And 2. it was needfull, that the Lord should appeare to him in such daunting power, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his owne quelling, but also for the terrour of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors for the time to come.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. This appearance of the Lord unto him, was not so much in his person as in his glory, nor what hee saw of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the light that strooke him blind, was with the eyes of his body but of his spirit.</p>

                        <p>Some have conceived that hee was rapt into the third hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and learned the Gospel by revelation, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. in those three dayes that hee was blind after the sight of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious light, and whilst hee fasted and prayed, Act. 9.9. And from this conceit hath another growne, as a supporter of that that bred it, namely that hee was not converted till seven yeers after our Saviours Ascension. This latter opinion was first invented, that his writing of the second Epistle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> might bee brought within the compasse of about foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeeres after his conversion; for so long a time and no more hee setteth betwixt his rapture and that Epistle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. and it was also originally grounded upon this suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, that his rapture was in the time of that his blindnesse. Two surmises probable and plausible enough to behold at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, but approaching nearer to them they will lose of their
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59068:76"/>
beautie, and upon serious weighing they will prove but a shadow. The question how hee came to the knowledge of the Gospel so soone, in so much that hee so soone preached it, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely gave the first occasion of the first opinion, namely of his rapture in his three dayes blindnesse.</p>
                        <p>A question to which an answer may bee easily given, and yet no such consequence concluded upon it. 1. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that <hi>hee received not the knowledge of the Gospel of man, nor was hee taught it but by the revelation of Iesus Christ,</hi> as himselfe saith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.12. yet might he have such a revelation, without any such rapture: For there were three other speciall wayes whereby God used to reveale himselfe and his will to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and servants, and those were by dreames, by visions and by a suddaine and immediate suggestion or revelation, which is called <hi>telling in the eare,</hi> as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.15.17. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20.4. And as for raptures they were the most extraordinary and the least familiar of all other: And how easily might <hi>Paul</hi> bee taught the mystery of the Gospel by some of the other meanes, especially since the Text hath expressely told that he had his visions? <hi>Act.</hi> 9.12. 2 <hi>Paul</hi> himself telleth of an ecsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie or rapture that hee was in, as hee was praying in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at <hi>Ierusalem, Act.</hi> 22.17. Now that that was in the second yeare of <hi>Claudius</hi> (as shall bee shewed by and by) when hee went to carry the almes of the Disciples to <hi>Ierusalem, Act.</hi> 11.30. it may bee confidently concluded upon, because that God in that his rapture telleth him that hee must thence forward goe farre away to preach unto the Gentiles, <hi>Act.</hi> 22.21. and when he returneth from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to <hi>Antioch,</hi> he is sent by the Church upon that imployment, by a speciall charge of the holy Ghost, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.2. And that from that time to the time of his writing the second Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> were about foureteene yeares as himselfe summeth it, wee shall evidence by some particulars, before wee part from this subject. Thus then in the first place wee see that neither his rapture was at the time of his conversion, nor that his conversion is to bee cast six or seven yeares forward that it may bee within foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene of that Epistle in regard of his rapture. But not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate

our selves any more in the varietie of opinions, that have fixed some one time, some another to the conversion of this Apostle, the next, readiest and surest way that I have found to resolve upon this doubtfull question and to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this scruple, is to goe by these collections and degrees.</p>

Now in what yeare of <hi>Claudius</hi> any of these things were done, hee hath not mentioned, but hath left it at large; and therefore wee may as well suppose, that <hi>Izates</hi> was made King in the first yeare of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Helena</hi> his mother went to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in his second, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> may, that she went thither in his fourth.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. That <hi>Paul</hi> going at that time of the famine to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> to bring the almes and collection to the poore Brethren of <hi>Iudea,</hi> had his trance in the Temple, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.17. and in that trance he was rapt into the third Heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. It may be thought indeed by the juncture of Story that <hi>Luke</hi> hath made, that this his trance, was at his first journey which hee tooke to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> after his conversion, which journey is mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.28. &amp; <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.18. for having from the sixth verse of <hi>Acts</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. and forward, related the Story of his conversion, and of <hi>Ananias</hi> comming to him and baptizing him, hee presently subjoyneth this, when <hi>I was come againe to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and was praying in the Temple, I was in a trance</hi>; as if that had beene the very first time, that ever hee came there after he was converted. But besides, that it is very common with Scripture to make such juncture for times and Stories, as if they were close together, when oftentimes there is very much space of time betwixt them, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.1. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.13, 14. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.20, 21, 26, 27. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>he proper intent of the Apostle in that Oration of his <hi>Acts</hi> 22. is to vindicate himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation laid against him for polluting the Temple; and chiefly
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59068:77"/>
to plead his authority and commission, and why hee had to deale among the Gentiles, and therefore hee insists upon two particular Commissions, one to Preach, and the other to preach to the Gentiles; and this is the reason why he joynes his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and his rapture in the Temple so close together, and not because they were so in time. Now this scruple being thus removed, and that considered which was said before, that in this trance in the Temple, God said hee was to send him to the Gentiles, and that accordingly hee was dispatched to that worke as soone as hee came to <hi>Antioch</hi>; it cannot but bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that his trance in the Temple was in the second of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and that this was his rapture into the third Heaven, since we read not of any rapture or trance that hee had, but this.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. That this trance or rapture was somewhat above foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares before hee wrote his second Epistle to <hi>Corinth,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. Now in that hee saith it was <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>before,</hi> or <hi>above</hi> fourteen yeares agoe, hee speaketh not of an indefinite time, for then for ought any reason can bee given to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, hee might as well have let the mention of the time alone, but that it was but a little above that space, though it were somewhat above exact fourteen yeares.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. When hee wrote that second Epistle to <hi>Corinth</hi> hee was in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> as is apparent by very many passages in that Epistle, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.14. and 2.13. &amp; 7.5. &amp; 9.2, 4. And thither he went upon the hubbub at <hi>Ephesus</hi> raised against him, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.1. where hee had even the sentence of death in himself, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. Now to count foureteene yeares compleat from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of <hi>Claudius,</hi> in which was <hi>Pauls</hi> rapture, it will bring us to the second yeare of <hi>Nero.</hi> And let us but cast and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute those shreds of time that wee can find hinted in the Acts of the Apostles, and wee shall find them agreeing with this account, and giving some light unto it. As first, it is said by <hi>Paul,</hi> that after hee had been at <hi>Ierusalem, hee must also see Rome,</hi> Acts 19.21. Now this doth argue the death of <hi>Claudius</hi>: for
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59068:78"/>
if he had expected all the Iews out of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it is averred both by the Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.2. and by <hi>Suetonius</hi> in <hi>Claud. chapt.</hi> 25. and never revoked his Edict for ought wee can read in any Story; it is very unlikely, and unreasonable to thinke, that <hi>Paul</hi> should thinke of going thither if <hi>Claudius</hi> were alive: for thither could hee neither goe without evident and inevitable danger of his owne life, nor could hee find so much as one person, of his owne Nation in the City when hee came there. By this therefore may bee concluded that <hi>Claudius</hi> was now dead, and <hi>Nero</hi> was going on his first yeare, when <hi>Paul</hi> publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth his resolution to goe for <hi>Rome.</hi> And the times from hence to his apprehension at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> may bee cast by these Counters. After this his declaring his intention for <hi>Rome,</hi> hee stayeth in <hi>Asia</hi> for a season, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.22. Now that this season was not long, both the preceding and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Verses doe help to confirme; for in the Verse before <hi>Paul</hi> is in a manner upon his motion toward <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and so to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> already. And it is very likely that the feast of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles which was in <hi>September</hi> induced him thither; but the danger that hee was in at <hi>Ephesus</hi> before his parting, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.23, 24. &amp;c. disappointed him of his journey thither, hee being now put off from providing accommodation for his voyage, and put to shift for life and liberty. About the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>October, Neroes</hi> first yeare was out: and <hi>Paul</hi> by that time it is like is got to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and while hee continues there he writes this Epistle; as the subscription of it in the Greeke, Syriack, Arabick, and divers other Translations doe reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly well aime it here; howsoever they doe it in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Or if wee should yeeld to <hi>Baronius,</hi> that it was written from <hi>Nicopolis, Tit.</hi> 2.12. it maketh no difference, as to the thing in hand, or at least very little, since wee are upon the time, and not upon the place; and the time of difference will not be above a moneth or two. <hi>Paul</hi> wintering so little at <hi>Nicopolis,</hi> as that hee was in motion againe about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> if not before, for his three moneths travaile of <hi>Greece,</hi> brings it up to the Passeover time, or neare up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

                           <hi>Acts</hi> 20.3.6. And after the Passeover weeke <hi>Paul</hi> sets for <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as the Story plainely leads him thither; and thence is hee Shipt for <hi>Rome,</hi> toward the latter end of our <hi>September,</hi> or about the Fast and solemne day of humiliation, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.9. And this was in the second yeare of <hi>Nero,</hi> now almost expiring, or very neare unto its end: And to this sense seemeth that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in <hi>Acts</hi> 24.27. to be understood, <hi>After two years Portius Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus came into Felix room.</hi> Not after two years of <hi>Pauls</hi> imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for that is utterly without any ground or warrant in the world, nor after two yeares of <hi>Felix</hi> Government, for hee had been Governour in <hi>Iud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>From thence goeth to <hi>Corinth,</hi> Acts 18.1. For all these jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys and actions wee will allow him half a yeare, and I cannot see how they could take so little.</p>
                        <p>At <hi>Corinth</hi> hee continueth a yeare and an halfe, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. verse 11. And this makes up 3 years since the Councell at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>After this long stay at <hi>Corinth</hi> he is persecuted, yet tarryeth a good while after, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.18.</p>
                        <p>From thence hee saileth to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but stayeth little, ver. 19.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>To <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>

                        <p>To <hi>Antioch,</hi> and spendeth some time there, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.22, 23.</p>
                        <p>Goeth over all the Country of <hi>Galatia,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And <hi>Phrygia</hi> in order, <hi>Acts</hi> 18.23. To these passages I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose there is hardly any that can allow him lesse then a whole yeare, that shall but seriously consider of the things that are
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59068:79"/>
mentioned, and the length of the journeys.</p>
                        <p>After his passing through <hi>Phrygia</hi> hee commeth to <hi>Ephesus, Acts</hi> 19.1.</p>
                        <p>And there continueth three yeares, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.8, 10, 21, 22. &amp; 20.31.</p>
                        <p>After this he goeth into <hi>Macedonia, Acts</hi> 20.1. from whence he writeth that second Epistle to <hi>Corinth</hi> in the beginning of the 2 year of <hi>Nero.</hi> So that yeelding these seven years for the travails of this Apostle, betwixt that time and the Councel of <hi>Ierusalem, Acts</hi> 15. (and lesse then seven, it is not possible to allow, seeing that foure yeares and an halfe of that space was taken up in the two Cities of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Ephesus</hi>) and it will result that the Councell at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was in the ninth yeare of <hi>Claudius</hi>: Now <hi>Paul</hi> himself reckoneth seventeen yeares from his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to this Councell, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.18. &amp; 2.1, which seventeen coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted backward from the ninth of <hi>Claudius</hi> it falleth out almost past all controversie that <hi>Pauls</hi> conversion was in the next year after our Saviours ascension; as may bee seen by this ensuing table.</p>

                     <p>This yeare there was a great disturbance in the City about Usury, the too common, and the too necessary evill of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. This breed-bate had severall times heretofore disturbed that State, though strict and rigorous courses were still taken about it. At the first, the interest of money lent, was proportioned and limited onely at the disposall of the lender, a measure alwayes inconstant, and often unconscionable. Whereupon, it was fixed at the last by the twelve tables to an ounce in the pound, which is proportionable in our English coine, to a penny in the shilling. Afterward by a Tribune sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute it was reduced to halfe an ounce, and at last the trade was quite forbidden. But such weeds are ever growing againe, though weeded out as cleane as possible; and so did this: Partly, through the covetousnesse of the rich, making way for their owne profit; and partly through the necessities of the poore, giving way to it for their own supply.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gracchus</hi> now Pretor, and hee to whom the complaint was made at this time, being much perplexed with the matter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth it to the Senate as perplexed as himselfe. Hee perplexed because of the multitude that were in danger, by breach of the Law; and they, because they were in danger themselves. Here was a prize for the greedy appetite of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> when so many of the best ranke and purses, were fallen into his lurch, and their moneys lent fallen into forfeiture, because of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull

lending. The guilty Senate obtaine the Emperours pardon, and eighteen moneths are allowed for bringing in of all mens accompts: In which time the scarcity of money did pinch the more, when every ones debts did come to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling: and in the nick of that there followed a great distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance about buying Lands, which before was invented for a remedy against the former complaints. But the Emperour was glad to salve up the matter by lending great summes of Money to the people <hi>gratis</hi> for three yeares.</p>

                     <p>With this one dramme of humanity, hee mingled many ounces of cruelty and blood-shed. For <hi>Considius Proculus</hi> as hee was celebrating his birth day without feare and with Festivity, is haled out of his owne house, brought to the barre and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: and his sister <hi>Sancia</hi> interdicted fire and water. <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peia Macrina</hi> banished; and her father and brother condemned, and slew themselves. But this yeare there is no reckoning of the slaughtered by name, for now their number grew number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse. All that were imprisoned and accused for conspiracy with <hi>Sejanus,</hi> hee causeth to bee slaine every mothers sonne. <hi>Now,</hi> saith mine Author, <hi>there lay an infinite massacre of all sexes, ages, conditions, noble and ignoble, either dispersed, or together on heaps. Nor was it permitted to friends or kindred to comfort, bewaile, or behold them any more: but a Guard set, which for the greater griefe abused the putrified bodies till they were haled into</hi> Tiber, <hi>and there left to sinke or swim, for none was suffered to touch or bury them.</hi> So farre was common humanity banished, and pity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed even after death, revenge being unsatisfied when it had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged, and cruelty extended beyond it selfe. Nor did the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers speed better then the accused, for hee also caused them to be put to death as well as the other, under that colour of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and retaliation, satisfying his cruelty both wayes to the greater extent. It were to be admired, and with admiration to be admired, never to be satisfied (were it not that the avenging

hand of God upon the bloody City is to bee acknowledged in it) that ever a people should be so universally bent one against another, seeking the ruine and destruction one of another, and furthering their owne misery, when they were most mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable already, in him that sought the ruine of them all. A fitter instrument could not the Tyrant have desired for such a purpose then themselves; nor when hee had them so plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their owne mischiefe, did he neglect the opportunity, or let them bee idle: For as hee saw accusations encrease, so did hee encrease his laws to breed more: insomuch that at the last it grew to bee capitall, for a servant to have fallen before, or neare the image of <hi>Augustus,</hi> or for any man to carry either coine or ring into the Stewes, or house of Office, if it bare up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it the image of <hi>Tiberius.</hi>

                     <p>Who can resolve whether it were more vexation to suffer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such foolish accusations, or upon others more solid; but as false as these were foolish? That was the fortune of <hi>Sextus Marius</hi> an intimate friend of the Emperours; but as it proved, not the Emperour so of his: This was a man of great riches and honour, and in this one action of a strange vaine-glory and revenge. Having taken a displeasure at one of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, hee inviteth him to his house, and there detained him feasting two dayes together. And on the first day hee pulleth his house downe to the ground, and on the next hee buildeth it up farre fairer and larger then before. The honest man when hee returned home found what was done, admired at the speed of the worke, rejoyced at the change of his house, but could not learn who had done the deed. At the last <hi>Marius</hi> confessed that he was the agent, and that hee had done it with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, To shew him that hee had power to doe him a displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, or a pleasure, as he should deserve it.

upon his pleasure, as thy neighbours upon thine. And so it came to passe that fortune read him the same lecture, that his fancy had done another. For having a young beautifull Daughter, and such a one, as on whom the Emperour had cast an eye, and so plainly, that the father spyed it, hee removed her to another place, and kept her there close and at distance, lest she should have been violated by him, who must have no denyall. <hi>Tiberius</hi> imagined as the thing was indeed, and when hee seeth that hee cannot enjoy his love, and satisfie his lust, hee turneth it to hate and revenge. And causeth <hi>Marius</hi> to be accused of incest with his daughter whom hee kept so close, and both father and daughter are condemned, and suffer for it both together.</p>

                     <p>In these so fearefull and horrid times, when nothing was safe, nothing secure, when silence and innocency were no protection, nor to accuse, no more safeguard then to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused, but when all things went at the Emperours will, and that will alwayes cruell, what course could any man take not to bee intangled, and what way being intangled to extricate himselfe? The Emperours frownes were death, and his favours little better; to be accused was condemnation, and to accuse was often as much; that now very many found no way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape death but by dying, nor to avoid the cruelty of others, but by being cruell to themselves. For though selfe-murder was alwayes held for a Roman valour, yet now was it become a meere necessity; men choosing that miserable exigent to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void a worse, as they supposed, and a present end, to escape fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture evills. So did <hi>Asinius Gallus</hi> at this time for the one, and <hi>Nerva</hi> for the other. This <hi>Gallus</hi> about three yeares agoe, comming to <hi>Tiberius</hi> upon an Ambassy, was fairely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained and royally feasted by him, but in the very <hi>interim</hi> he writeth letters to the Senate in his accusation. Such was the Tyrant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59068:83"/>
his dainty fare. A thing both inhumane and unusuall, that a man the same day should eate, drinke and be merry with the Emperour, and the same day bee condemned in the Senate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Emperours accusation. An Officer is sent to fetch him away a Prisoner; from whence hee had but lately gone Ambassadour. The pooreman being thus betrayed, thought it vaine to beg for life; for that hee was sure would bee denyed him, but he begged that he might presently bee put to death, and that was denyed also. For the bloody Emperour deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not in blood and death onely, but in any thing that would cause other mens misery, though it were their life. So having once committed one of his friends to a most miserable and intolerable imprisonment; and being sollicited and earnestly sued unto, that he might bee speedily executed and put out of his misery, hee flatly denyed it, saying, That <hi>hee was not growne friends with him yet.</hi> Such was the penance that hee put poore <hi>Gallus</hi> to: a life farre worser then a present death; for hee ought him more spight and torture then a suddaine executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The miserable man being imprisoned and straitly looked to, not so much for feare of his escape by flight, as of his escape by death, was denyed the sight and conference of any one whosoever, but him onely that brought him his pitifull dyet, which served onely to prolong his wretched life, and not to comfort it; and he was forced to take it, for hee must by no meanes be suffered to die. Thus lived (if it may bee called a life) a man that had been of the honourablest rank and office in the City; lingring and wishing for death, or rather dying for three yeares together; and now at last hee findeth the means to famish himself, and to finish his miserable bondage with as miserable an end; to the sore displeasure of the Emperour, for that hee had escaped him, and not come to publike execution.</p>
                     <p>Such an end also chose <hi>Nerva</hi> one of his neare friends and familiars, but not like the other, because of miseries past or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; but because of feare and foresight of such to come. His way that hee tooke to dispatch himself of his life, was by totall ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence and refusall of food; which when <hi>Tiberius</hi> perceived
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59068:84"/>
was his intent, hee sits downe by him, desires to know his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and begs with all earnestnesse of him, that he would desist from such a design: <hi>For what scandall,</hi> saith he, <hi>will it be to mee, to have one of my nearest friends to end his own life, and no cause given why he should so die?</hi> But <hi>Nerva</hi> satisfied him not either in answer or in act, but persisted in his pining of himself, and so dyed.</p>

                     <p>To such like ends came also <hi>Agrippina</hi> and <hi>Drusus,</hi> the wife and son of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> and mother and brother of <hi>Caius,</hi> the next Emperour that should succeed. These two, the daughter in law, and Grandchild of <hi>Tiberius</hi> himselfe, had about foure yeares agoe beene brought into question by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind and inhumane accusation, and into hold and custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy untill this time.

Here at last was an end of <hi>Drusus</hi> his misery, but so was there not of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his cruelty towards him; for he denyed the dead body buriall in a fitting place; he reviled &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced the memory of him with hideous and feigned scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals and criminations, and shamed not to publish in the open Senate, what words had passed from the pining man against <hi>Tiberius</hi> himselfe; when in agony through hunger hee craved meat, and was denyed it.

And it was not long, but she tasted of the very same cup, both of the same kind of death, and of the same kind of disgracing after. For being pined after the same manner, that it might be coloured that she did it of her self (a death very unfitting the greatest Princesse then alive,) she was afterward slandered by <hi>Tiberius</hi> for adultery with <hi>Gallus</hi> that died so lately, and that shee caused her owne death for griefe of his. She and her son were denyed buryall befitting their degree, but hid in some obscure place where no one knew, which was no little distaste and discontentment to the people. The Tyrant thought it a speciall cause of boasting and extolling his owne goodnesse, that she had not been strangled, nor dyed the death of common base offenders: And since it was her fortune to die on the very same day that <hi>Sejanus</hi> had done two yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>viz.

A ceremony used by <hi>Augustus,</hi> whensoever hee came to a tenth yeer of his reign, but by <hi>Tiberius</hi> there was not the like cause. One would have thought the twenty yeers past of his inhumane and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous reigne should have given the City more then enough of such an Emperour: and have caused her to have longed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his end then to have prolonged his dominion. But shee will make a virtue now or complement rather of necessity,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59068:87"/>
and will get thanks of him for continuing of that which shee cannot shake off, and is willing that he shall reign still, because she knew he would do so whether shee will or no. It is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne way of currying favour, to please a man in his owne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, when we dare not crosse it.

For while they thus took on them to confirme his rule they did but shake his title as he conceived, and told him a riddle that hee reigned by their courtesie and not by his own interest: but when hee punished them that would take on them to confirme this superioritie hee proved it independent, and not pinned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their will.</p>

For <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> the first of that name, having built a tower neer unto the Temple, and living in it himself, and after him, some of his successors, he laid up there those holy garments, which they onely might weare as in a place most convenient, both where to put them on when they came into the Temple, and to put them off when they went into the Citie. But <hi>Herod</hi>
                        <pb n="160" facs="tcp:59068:91"/>
in after times seising upon that tower and repairing it, and naming it <hi>Antonia</hi> in honour of the great <hi>Antony,</hi> hee seised also upon the custody of those robes, when hee found them there, and so also did <hi>Archelaus,</hi> his sonne. But the Romans deposing of <hi>Archelaus</hi> and usurping his whole dominion (if reassuming of that which they had bestowed before, may bee called usurpation) they also as hee had done, kept these sacred garments under their hands: Laying them up in a roome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the seales of the Priests, and the keepers of the treasury: and the keeper of the Tower set up a Candle there every day. Seven dayes before any of the feasts, they were delivered out by the same keeper, and purified because they came out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then hands, and used the first day of the feast, and restored the second, and laid up as before. <hi>Vitellius</hi> graciously restored the custody of them to the Priests as had been used of old. But <hi>Ioseph</hi> who was also called <hi>Caiaphas</hi> who should have first worn them after, was removed by him from the high priest-hood, and <hi>Ionathan</hi> the sonne of <hi>Ananus</hi> placed in his stead. And thus is one of the unjust Judges of our Saviour judged himself, and the next yeere, and by this same <hi>Vitellius</hi> wee shall have the other judged also.</p>

At the first hee was well accepted and well affected by them and among them, as he had been desired by them, but afterward he was disliked and displaced by <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabanus</hi> whom they had called in for their King in his stead. This <hi>Artabanus</hi> having been kept in awe by <hi>Germanicus</hi> whilest he lived, and having been a good while agoe quitted and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of that awe by <hi>Germanicus</hi> his death, and having at this present, a fit opportunity for the seisure of the Kingdome of <hi>Armenia,</hi> by the death of <hi>Artaxias</hi> their King, he taketh upon him to place <hi>Arsaces</hi> his own eldest son in that throne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withall some treasures that <hi>Vonones</hi> had left in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and challenging the royalty of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Macedon,</hi> and the old possessions of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi>: This was a proud scorne and defiance to the Romans, and such as was not possible for their victoriousnesse to digest, nor safe for him to offer, but that he was imboldned to it by considering the Emperours old age. But <hi>Sinnaces</hi> and <hi>Abdus</hi> and other Nobles of <hi>Parthia,</hi> not trusting their lives and liberties to the rashnesse of <hi>Artabanus,</hi> come secretly to <hi>Rome</hi> and commit the matter to <hi>Tiberius</hi>: He upon their request and glad of opportunity to correct the insolencies of <hi>Artabanus</hi> giveth them <hi>Phraates,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sonne of <hi>Phraates</hi> their old King, who also lay for an

And thus is <hi>Artabanus</hi> in a faire way of an equall retaliation, to lose his owne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as he had usurped another mans. As they were thus tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing homeward with this designe and plot in their minds and hands, <hi>Artabanus</hi> having intelligence of the matter coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terplotteth againe: and fairely inviting <hi>Abdus</hi> under pretence of great amity to a banquet, preventeth his future designes by poison, and stops the haste of <hi>Sinna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But this unexpected accident, caused not <hi>Tiberius</hi> to forelet or neglect the opportunity so fairely begun, but to follow it the more earnestly.

For the better securing of <hi>Mithradates</hi> to this imployment, hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him and his brother <hi>Pharasmenes</hi> friends, between whom there had been some feud before, and inciteth them both to this same service. This they accordingly performe, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into <hi>Armenia,</hi> they shortly make the King away by bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of his servants, and take the City <hi>Artaxata</hi> with their Army. <hi>Artabanus</hi> upon these tidings sendeth away <hi>Orodes</hi> his other sonne, to relieve and to revenge: But <hi>Pharasmanes</hi> having joyned the <hi>Albanes</hi> and <hi>Sarmatians</hi> to his party, and hee and the <hi>Iberians</hi> by this union being masters of the passages, they powre in <hi>Sarmatians</hi> into <hi>Armenia</hi> by multitudes through the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59068:92"/>
straits of the <hi>Caspian</hi> mountaines, and deny passage to any that would aide the <hi>Parthian.</hi> So that <hi>Orodes</hi> commeth up to <hi>Pharasmanes,</hi> but can goe no further, and they both lie in the field so close together that <hi>Pharasmanes</hi> biddeth him battell at his owne trenches: which being stoutly and strangely fought between so many nations and so differently barbarous, it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned that the two Princes met in the heat of the light, and <hi>Pharasmanes</hi> wounded <hi>Orodes</hi> through the Helmet, but could not second his blow himselfe being borne away by his horse beyond his reach, and the other was suddainly succomed and sheltered by his guard. The rumour of this wound of the King by dispersion grew to a certain report of his death, and that, by as certain an apprehension, grew to the losse of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> day. Nor was the rumour altogether mistaken, for the wound though it were not so sodainly, yet was it so surely dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it brought him to his end. Now it is time for <hi>Artabanus</hi> to looke and stirre about him when he hath lost his two sons, and when his two kingdomes are neere upon losing. Hee mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stereth and picketh up all the forces his dominions could afford, and those no more neither (if they were enough) then the present necessity and forlorne estate of himselfe and kingdomes did require. What would have been the issue, and where the storme of this cloud, and shower of these prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would have lighted, <hi>Vitellius</hi> gave not leave and time to be determined, for raising all the legions of <hi>Syria</hi> and therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, (for <hi>Tiberius</hi> upon these troubles had made him ruler of all the East) he pretended an invasion of <hi>Mesopotamia.</hi> But <hi>Artabanus</hi> suspecting whither that warre might bend indeed, and his discontented subjects, upon this conceit of the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Romans daring to shew their revolt against him, which they durst not before, hee was forced to flee with some forlorne company into <hi>Scythia,</hi> hoping that his absence might remove the hatred of the <hi>Parthians,</hi> which wee shall see here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after came accordingly to passe, and <hi>Vitellius</hi> without any blow struck, maketh <hi>Tiridates</hi> King in his stead.</p>

Now <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe testifieth that three yeers after his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version he went up to <hi>Ierusalem, Gal.</hi> 1.18. That space of time he spent in <hi>Damascus,</hi> in <hi>Arabia</hi> and in <hi>Damascus</hi> againe. For so himself testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth in the verse before. But how long time hee tooke up in these severall abodes in these places, it is not determinable nor indeed is it materiall to inquire, since we have the whole time of all his abodes summed up in that account of three yeers: Now whereas there is no mention in <hi>Lukes</hi> relation of his journey into <hi>Arabia,</hi> but he maketh him (as one would think) to come up to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> at his first departure from <hi>Damascus,</hi> we have shewed elsewhere that it is no uncouth thing with this and the other Evangelists, to make such briefe transitions, sometimes in stories of a large distance: and <hi>Paul</hi> himself plainely sheweth us in the place alledged, how to make the briefe story of <hi>Luke</hi> full and compleat, and to speak it out: Namely that <hi>Paul</hi> upon his comming after his conversion into <hi>Damascus,</hi> began there to preach, and <hi>increased more and more in strength, and confounded the Iewes that dwelt at Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scus, proving that Iesus was the very Christ:</hi> And having preached a while in <hi>Damascus,</hi> hee goeth into <hi>Arabia,</hi> which countrey
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59068:95"/>
was now under the same government with <hi>Damascus,</hi> namely under King <hi>Aretas</hi>) and after a while hee returned into <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scus</hi> againe: And then do the Jewes there seek to kill him, and they incense the governour of the Citie under <hi>Aretas</hi> against him, so that hee setteth a watch to take him, but he escapeth over the wall by night in a Basket, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.33. We shall see by and by, that there were preparations for warre this yeere, betwixt <hi>Aretas</hi> the King of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch, and it is not improbable that the Jewes in those times of commotion did accuse <hi>Paul</hi> to the governour of <hi>Damascus</hi> under <hi>Aretas</hi> for a spie or for a man that was an enemy to the Kings cause, and so they interest the governor in a quarrell against him: And this very thing being considered may helpe somewhat to confirme this for the yeare of <hi>Pauls</hi> comming from <hi>Damascus</hi> for feare of his life to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> if his owne accounting the yeers did not make it plaine enough.</p>

                        <p>This very thing hath caused some to conceive that <hi>Paul</hi> had a journey to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> a little after his conversion, and before ever he went into <hi>Arabia</hi>: because they cannot conceive how it should be possible, that hee should have beene a convert and a Preacher of the Gospell three yeers together, and yet his conversion and his present qualities should bee unknowne to the Church at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: and the rather because hee himself saith that the wonder of <hi>his conversion was not done in a corner,</hi> Acts 26.26.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> But these two or three considerations may helpe to resolve the scruple. 1. The distance betwixt <hi>Damascus</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> which was exceeding great. 2. The quarrels betwixt <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Aretas,</hi> which were a meanes to hinder intercourse betwixt those two places. 3. The persecution that continued still upon the Church of <hi>Iudea,</hi> which would keepe Disciples of <hi>Damascus</hi> from going thither. And 4. the just feare that might possesse the Disciples at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> in the very time of persecution: For though it was said before, the Church at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> and of <hi>Iudaea</hi> injoyed a great deale of rest and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity after the conversion of <hi>Paul</hi> their great persecutor, in comparison of what they had done before, yet was not the persecution of the Church utterly extinct to the very time of <hi>Pauls</hi> comming up to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but continued still, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the lesse wonder if the Disciples there, bee the more fearefull and cautelous.</p>

                     <p>How <hi>Barnabas</hi> came acquainted with the certainty of <hi>Pauls</hi> conversion, better then the other Disciples, is not easie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve: It is like that hee being abroad for feare of the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the other of the Preachers were, (all but the Apostles) went in his travailes towards <hi>Damascus</hi> or <hi>Arabia,</hi> and so had
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59068:96"/>
heard and learned the certainty of the matter: However it is pregnant to our observation, that hee that was afterwards to be fellow traveller and labourer with <hi>Paul</hi> in the Gospel to the Gentiles is now made the instrument and meanes of his first admission to the societie of the Apostles. It is possible that there had been some acquaintance betwixt these two men in former times, they being both Grecizing Jewes, the one of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi> the other of <hi>Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>

                           <hi>Sect.</hi> And brought him to the Apostles.</head>
                        <p>That is, to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames the lesse</hi>: for other of the Apostles, hee himself relateth that hee saw none, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.18. What was become of the rest of the twelve, is not determinable: it is more then probable they were not now at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it is hardly possible for <hi>Paul</hi> not to have seene them in fifteene dayes abode there: It is likely they were preaching and setling Churches up and down the Country, and <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> the two most peculiar Ministers of the Circumcision, abode at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to take care of the Church there: For that these were so, and in what particular, the dispensation of their Ministery differed, wee shall take occasion to shew after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; onely here wee cannot omit to take notice of that temper as I may so call it, which the Text holdeth out against the Primacy and Prelacy that is held by some to have been among the Apostles: For whereas some conceive <hi>Iames</hi> to have been Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> this Text sets <hi>Peter</hi> in the same fourme and equality with him in that place: and whereas it is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againe, that <hi>Peter</hi> was Prince of the Apostles, this Text hath equalled <hi>Iames</hi> with him.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. And thus that persecution that began about <hi>Stephen</hi> had lasted till this very same time of <hi>Pauls</hi> comming to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
                           <pb n="171" facs="tcp:59068:96"/>
for so it is apparent, both by the feare and suspitiousnesse of the Disciples at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as also by the very clausure of the Text, Vers. 31. <hi>Then had the Churches rest.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. The length of this persecution by computation of the times as they have been cast up before, seemeth to have beene about three yeers and an halfe, the renowned number, and time so oft mentioned and hinted in Scripture.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The company of Disciples or beleevers continued still at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> for all the persecution, as to the generalitie of them; as was said before: onely the Ministers or Preachers were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroad, all of them except the twelve Apostles.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Some of those Preachers were by this time returned back againe, the heat of the persecution abating, as it is apparent by <hi>Barnabas</hi> now being at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: and of some such men, is it properest to understand the word <hi>Disciples</hi> Vers. 26. <hi>Saul assayed to joyne himselfe to the Disciples.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. Therefore the absence of the ten Apostles from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was not for feare of the persecution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but for the dispersion of the Gospel and setling of the Churches.</p>

                        <p>This is most properly to bee understood of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> that he declared these things to the Apostles, though there be, that thinke it is meant of <hi>Pauls</hi> declaring them: and they read it thus, And <hi>Barnabas brought him to the Apostles, and hee,</hi> that is, <hi>Paul, declared unto them.</hi>

                        <hi>Vers. 29.</hi> And he disputed against the Grecians.</head>
                     <p>Gr. <hi>Against the Hellenists</hi>: which very place helpeth againe to confirme the interpretation and glosse wee set upon this word before, namely, that it meaneth not, Greeks converted to the Jewes Religion, but Jewes conversing and cohabiting among the Greeke nation. For, 1. there can be none or small reason given, why converted Greeks should bee so furiously Jewish as to go about to kill <hi>Paul</hi> for preaching against Judaisme, and wee heare not the Jews stirring against him for it. 2. What reason can be given why <hi>Paul</hi> should bend his disputations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst converted Greeks more then against Jewes? Certainly the Jewes had more need of confutation in their Judaisme then the other had. And 3. it is very questionable, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Greeks, which were strangers and sojourners at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> and among the Jewes, durst go about to kill a Jew in the midst of the Jewes, and there being not a Jew that had any thing to say against him. It is therefore more then probable, that these Hellenists were Jewes that had lived among the Greeks, or of the Grecian dispersion, and that they used the Greek tongue: and that <hi>Paul</hi> chose to dispute with them, partly for that they living among the Gentiles, were by a kind of an <hi>Antiperistasis</hi> more zealously Jewish, and partly, because of their language, the Greek tongue, which was the very language <hi>Paul</hi> had learned from a child.</p>
                     <p>The times of the stories next succeeding when the Text hath done with the story of <hi>Paul,</hi> are somewhat unfixed, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, in what yeer they came to passe: namely of <hi>Peters</hi> raysing of <hi>Aeneas</hi> from sicknesse, <hi>Dorcas</hi> from death, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in <hi>Cornelius</hi> to the Gospel: But the best conjecture that can bee given of the times of these stories, is by casting and computing the history backward: And so we finde, 1. That the famine prophecied of by <hi>Agabus,</hi> was in the second of <hi>Claudius,</hi> as was shewed before. 2. Wee may then conceive that this
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59068:97"/>
prophecie of <hi>Agabus</hi> was in <hi>Claudius</hi> his first, and that was the yeer or some part of the yeer that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> spent at <hi>Antioch, Act.</hi> 11.26. 3. The last yeere of <hi>Caius</hi> wee may hold to bee the yeer of <hi>Antiochs</hi> first receiving the Gospell, of <hi>Barnabas</hi> his comming thither, and of his journey to <hi>Tarsus</hi> to seek <hi>Saul,</hi> Act. 11.20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. And 4. the third yeer of <hi>Caius</hi> which was his last yeer but one, we may suppose accordingly to have been the yeer of <hi>Peters</hi> actions with <hi>Aeneas, Dorcas</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and to that yeer shall wee referre the handling of the Texts that concerne those actions, and wee will carry on the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Iewish</hi> Story, as they fall in time, till we come thither.</p>

                     <p>These diseases of the Roman body were far from the heart, and yet was the heart, the Citie it self but little the better; for though some veines were opened in these warres which one would have thought should have turned the blood another way, yet did the Citie through the cruelty of the Emperour bleed inwardly still.

                     <p>Besides this deluge of blood, which overflowed the Citie continually, there was also this yeer a deluge of water. For <hi>Tiber</hi> rose so high and violently into the town, that many streets became navigable, and where men had walked lately on their feet, they might have passed now up and downe in ships. And a greater misfortune happened this yeer likewise by the contrary element: for a terrible fire consumed the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the mount <hi>Aventine</hi> and that part of the <hi>Circus</hi> that lay betwixt that and the Palace; For the repaire of all which again, <hi>Tiberius</hi> out of his own treasure gave a great summe of money: <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith <hi>Millies Sestertium,</hi> which according to the value and reckoning of our English coine amounted to eight hundred thousand pounds, within nineteen thousand.

hee caused the noblest and most principall to bee put to death.

Fourthly, and lastly, that which maketh all the rest of the story to bee doubted of, and which may justly hinder the entertainment of it, is, what is added in the common relation of the story. That <hi>Tiberius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring this matter to the Senate, with his vote, that <hi>Christ</hi> should bee numbred among the Gods, and <hi>Christianity</hi> among their holy things; the Senate crossed him in it with flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety, because <hi>Pilate</hi> had written of it to him, and not to them.

                     <p>This <hi>Agrippa</hi> was the sonne of <hi>Aristobulus</hi> (who dyed by the cruelty of his father <hi>Herod</hi>) and hee was a man that had sufficiently tryed the vicissitudes of fortune heretofore, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so much as hee is about to doe now. A good while agoe hee had lived in <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the familiarity of <hi>Drusus</hi> the son of <hi>Tiberius:</hi> That great acquaintance caused great expences; partly in his own port and pompe, and partly in gifts and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence bestowed upon others. When <hi>Drusus</hi> dyed, then <hi>Agrippaes</hi> estate is not onely dead, but his hopes also: so that hee is forced to flee from <hi>Rome</hi> into <hi>Iudea</hi> for debt and pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and thence into a certaine Tower in <hi>Idumea</hi> for shame and discontent. His wife <hi>Cyprus</hi> by sollicitation and suing to <hi>Herodias,</hi> obtaineth <hi>Herods</hi> favour so farre, that hee was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to <hi>Tiberias,</hi> made a chiefe Governour or Officer of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and allowance given him for his Diet. But this lasted not long ere <hi>Herod</hi> and hee fell out; whereupon hee removed away, and betooke himself to <hi>Flaccus</hi> the then Governour of <hi>Syria,</hi> who had been his old acquaintance at <hi>Rome:</hi> Long he had not continu'd there neither, but <hi>Aristobulus</hi> his brother wrought him out of his favour and abode there. From thence hee went to <hi>Ptolomais,</hi> intending to have set from thence for <hi>Italy,</hi> but was forced to stay till hee had borrowed some moneys before: Being now furnished and shipped, hee was againe stopped by <hi>Herennius Capito,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Iamnia,</hi> for some money that hee ought to the Treasury of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> And what must he doe now? Hee must not goe till hee have paid the summe,

and when hee hath paid it, then hee cannot goe for want of more. He taketh on him to obey the arrest while it was day, but at night hee cut cables, and set away for <hi>Alexandria:</hi> There hee reneweth his borrowing againe of <hi>Alexander Alabarcha</hi> and obtaineth of him five talents for his <hi>viaticum</hi>: and now this yeare (namely as <hi>Iosephus</hi> noteth it, the yeare before <hi>Tiberius</hi> his death) hee setteth away for <hi>Italy</hi> againe.

                     <p>Happy might now <hi>Agrippa</hi> thinke himselfe, if hee can but hold so: For he hath obtained the inward friendship of <hi>Caius,</hi> and with it retained the outward favour of <hi>Tiberius.

For <hi>Caius</hi> and hee being very intimate and private together, whether more affectionately, or undiscreetly, hee himselfe best felt; hee brake out into this dangerous wish, That <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius might soon die, and Caius as soon come to rule in his stead.</hi> These words were heard by <hi>Eutychus</hi> his servant, and a while concealed; but when <hi>Agrippa</hi> prosecuted him for stealing some of his cloaths, which hee had stoln indeed, hee then brake forth and revealed all: for fleeing for his theft, and caught and brought before <hi>Piso</hi> the Sheriffe of the City, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the reason of his flight, hee answered that he had a great secret to impart to <hi>Cesar,</hi> which concerned his life. <hi>Piso</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sent him bound to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who also kept him bound and unexamined a certain season: Now began <hi>Agrippa</hi> to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten and spurre on his owne misery and vexation: Whether having forgotten the words that he had spoken, or not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the presence of his servant, at the speech; or not suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting that his tale to <hi>Cesar</hi> would bee against himself; or which was likelyest, thinking to make his cause the better by his confidence, he solliciteth his old friend <hi>Antonia,</hi> to urge the Emperour for a tryall of his servant. <hi>Tiberius</hi> declineth it, though he suspected the matter; not so much belike for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippaes</hi> sake, as for <hi>Caius</hi> sake, whom the familiarity that was
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59068:102"/>
betwixt them made him suspect to be accessary, if any thing should prove otherwise then well. But being still importuned by <hi>Antonia,</hi> at last when hee had uttered these words, <hi>Let the Gods witnesse O Antonia, that what I shall doe, I doe not of my own mind, but by thy solicitation</hi>: Hee commanded <hi>Eutychus</hi> to bee brought forth, who being examined, confessed readily that such words were spoken by <hi>Agrippa</hi> to <hi>Caius,</hi> himselfe being present, adding others no lesse dangerous, that were spoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout young <hi>Tiberius.</hi> The Emperour as readily beleeved the matter; and presently called out to <hi>Macro</hi> to bind him. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cro</hi> not understanding that he meant <hi>Agrippa,</hi> prepared to bind <hi>Eutychus</hi> more strictly for examination: but <hi>Tiberius</hi> having walked about the place, and comming to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> it is this man saith he, that I commanded to be bound.

Well, <hi>Agrippa</hi> is tyed in bands, and led away to prison as hee was, in his purple robes, a garment very incompatible with chaines, unlesse of Gold. Being exceeding thirsty with heate and sorrow, as he went towards the prison, hee spyed one <hi>Thaumastus</hi> a servant of <hi>Caius,</hi> carrying a Tankard of water, and hee desired some to drinke; which when the servant freely and readily gave him, <hi>If ever,</hi> saith hee, I <hi>escape and get out of these bonds, I will not faile to obtaine thy freedome, who hast not refused to minister to mee in my misery and chaines, as well as thou didst in my prosperity and pompe.</hi> And this his promise he afterward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>

His way to try their skill was desperate and terrible, but such a one as best befitted such as would take upon them to foresee things to come, and it was this: when hee consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of any businesse, saith <hi>Tacitus,</hi> hee used the top of his house, and the privacy of one onely servant, a man utterly unlearned, and of a strong bulke of body: when hee had a mind to try any mans skill, this Lubber was to goe before him over craggy, steepe and dangerous Rocks that hung over the Sea, and over which his house stood: and as they returned againe, if there were any suspition that the Prognosticator had given an answer fraudulent or lying, hee flung him into the Sea, lest hee should reaveale the secret that hee had beene questioned upon. <hi>Thrasyllus</hi> at his first comming, being brought to this dangerous tryall, and having presaged <hi>Tiberius</hi> should bee Emperour, and having foretold other things to come, hee was asked by him whether hee could calculate his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie; which when hee went about to doe, and had set a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, upon the sight and study upon it, hee was first in a muse and then in a feare, and the more hee viewed it, the more hee feared: and at last cryed out that some strange and suddaine danger was neer and ready to seize upon him. Then <hi>Tiberius</hi> imbracing him commended his skill, secured him against the danger, and retained him ever after for his intimate familiar. This yeer (as <hi>Dion</hi> doth place it) befell this great Wizzards death, and as it proved, a forerunner of the Emperours: With whom hee did more good with one lie, neere his latter end, then hee had done with all his Astrologicall truths (if he ever told any) all his life long. For assuring him by his skill, that hee should yet live ten yeers longer, though in his heart hee thought no such thing, hee caused him to bee

slack and remisse in putting divers men to death, whose end hee had hastned, had hee knowne the haste of his owne, and so they escaped.</p>

                     <p>There had been a long grudge betwixt <hi>Aretas</hi> the King of <hi>Arabia Petraea,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Tetrarch,</hi> and a field had beene fought between them before this. For <hi>Herod</hi> having put away his wife which was <hi>Aretas</hi> daughter, and having taken <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias</hi> (the wife of his owne brother <hi>Philip</hi> and hee yet living) in her stead, it is no wonder if <hi>Aretas</hi> dogged him for revenge for this indignity to his Daughter and himselfe. Wherefore hee beginneth to quarrell with him and to seek occasion of warre, by challenge of a territory controvertible, and they come to a pitched battell, in which <hi>Herods</hi> Army is utterly overthrown, by meanes of some treachery wrought by some fugitives from his brother <hi>Philips</hi> Tetrarchy which had taken up Armes to fight under his colours: And here, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> hath observed. <hi>It was the observation of divers that this his Army utterly perished through Gods just punishment upon him for the murder of Iohn the Baptist.</hi> And it is worth the marking, that this overthrow took beginning from men of that country whence <hi>Herodias</hi> the causer of that murder, and of the present disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse had come. <hi>Herod</hi> upon this defeat, doubtfull of better successe at another time, for it may bee his conscience told him this was but deserved, betaketh himselfe by letters to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius,</hi> certifying him of the accident, and it is likely, not without much aggravation. The Emperour either displeased at the fortune of <hi>Aretas</hi> in his victory, or at his audaciousnesse in stirring so within the Empire, or at both together, sendeth angry letters to <hi>Vitellius</hi> the Governour of <hi>Syria,</hi> charging him to undertake the warre, and either to bring the rebellious King prisoner alive, or to send his head to <hi>Rome.</hi> But before the designe came to maturity, <hi>Tiberius</hi> that had thus threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned another mans life had lost his owne, as will appeare here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: when this first battell was that was so fatall to <hi>Herod,</hi> it shall not bee insisted on to question, but that this brewing towards a new warre, befell in this yeer, is apparent sufficiently by the sequell.</p>

Hee was used by <hi>Tiberius</hi> as an instrument to bring down <hi>Seianus,</hi> the one bad, and the other worse; and after hee had done that, none must stand by his good will, that was likely to stand in his way: Hee was made master of the <hi>Praetorian</hi> Souldiers in <hi>Seia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his stead, and as hee possessed his place, so did hee his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the Emperour, and the crookednesse of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: as if all the honours, fortune, and wickednesse of <hi>Seianus</hi> had been intailed upon <hi>Macro.</hi> An agent as fit for <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> as could bee required, and a successor as fit for <hi>Seianus.</hi> A man as bloody as the Tyrant could desire him, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more then hee set him on worke. Hee was the continuall <hi>Alguazil</hi> and <hi>Inquisitor</hi> for the friends and complices of the late ruined Favorite, and under colour of that pursuite, hee tooke out of the way, whosoever would not friend and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with him. Of that number were <hi>Cn. Domitius,</hi> and <hi>Vibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Marsus,</hi> accused with <hi>Albucilla</hi> the wife of <hi>Satrius secundus,</hi> for Adultery, but all three together for conspiracy against the Emperour, yet was there no hand of the Emperours shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the prosecution of the matter, which shewed the onely spleene and machination of the Blood-hound <hi>Macro. Albucilla,</hi>

whether guilty indeed or knowing that his malice and power would make her so, stabbed her selfe, thinking to have died by her owne hand, but the wound not being deadly, shee was taken away to prison. <hi>Grasidius</hi> and <hi>Fregellanus</hi> the pretended Pandars of her adulteries were punished the one with banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the other with degradation, and the same penaltie was inflicted upon <hi>Laelius Balbus</hi>: A man, but justly, paid in his owne coyne, to the rejoycing and content of divers, for hee had been a strong and violent accuser of many innocents. <hi>Domitius</hi> and <hi>Marsus</hi> (it may bee) as guilty as the woman, but more discreet, traversed the indictment, and saved their owne lives, partly by the shortnesse of the Emperours life, and partly by the feigned prediction of <hi>Thrasyllus,</hi> that promised that it should bee long. But too sullen was the indignation of <hi>L. Arruntius</hi> against <hi>Macro,</hi> and too desperate his ill conceit of <hi>Caius</hi> who was to succeed in the Empire, for when hee was inwrapt in the same accusation with the two last named, and might have escaped the same escape that they did, yet despised hee so to outlive the cruelty of <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Macro,</hi> as to come under the greater cruelty of <hi>Macro</hi> and <hi>Caius.</hi> No, saith hee, <hi>I have lived long enough, and (to my sorrow) too long. Nor doth any thing repent me more, then that thus I have endured an old age under the scornes, dangers and hate, first of</hi> Selanus, <hi>now of</hi> Macro, <hi>and alwayes of one great one or another, and that for no other fault then for detesting their flagitiousnesse. It is true indeed that I may survive the old age and weaknesse of Tiberius, but what hopes to doe so by the youth of</hi> Caius, <hi>and wickednesse of</hi> Macro? <hi>Can</hi> Caius <hi>a youth do well being led by</hi> Macro, <hi>who so corrupted</hi> Tiberius <hi>in his age? No, I see more tyranny like to come then hath been yet: And therefore will I deliver my selfe from the present misery, and that to come</hi>: And with these words and resolution, hee cut his owne veines, and so bled to death: and spent a blood and a spirit, what pitie it was that they should have been so lost? As <hi>Macro</hi> thus divided his paines in crueltie, betwixt the satisfying of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his mind and his owne malice, so also did hee, his affections shall I say? or flattery rather, and own-end observances betwixt
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59068:105"/>
                        <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Caius.</hi> For as hee sought to please the one that now ruled, for his owne present security, so did hee, to indear the other that was to succeed, for his future safety: Hereupon he omitted not any opportunitie nor occasion, that he might skrew <hi>Caius</hi> further and further into <hi>Tiberius</hi> his favour, and to keepe him there, that he might doe as much for himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the favour of <hi>Caius.</hi> One raritie and non-parallel of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequiousnesse hee shewed to the young Prince, worth recording to his shame, for hee caused his owne wife <hi>Ennia Thrasylla</hi> to intangle the youthfulnesse of <hi>Caius</hi> into her love and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and then parted hee with her and gave her to him in marriage. The old Emperour could not but observe this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of pretended friendship, nor were his old eyes so blind, but hee perceived his flattery plaine in other carriages, in so much that hee brake out to him in these plaine words: <hi>Well, thou forsakest the setting Sun, and onely lookest upon the rising.</hi>

Well: something hee must pretend to give countenance and credit to his care of the common good. In sine his great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration concluded in this easie issue, namely in a prayer to the Gods to designe his successor, and in an <hi>auspicium</hi> of his owne hatching, that hee should bee his successor that should come first in to him upon the next morning, which proved to bee <hi>Caius.</hi> It shewed no great reality nor earnestnesse for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good in him at all, when so small a thing as this must sway his judgement, &amp; such a trifle be the casting voyce in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of so great a moment.

Yet giveth he counsaile to <hi>Caius</hi> inciting him to goodnes which he himself could never follow, &amp; exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to tendernesse towards young <hi>Tiberius,</hi> which in his heart he was reasonable indifferent whether he followed or no.</p>

                        <hi>Charicles</hi> the Doctor gave notice of his death approaching, to <hi>Caius</hi> and <hi>Macro,</hi> though hee stole this judgment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture but by a sleight. For sitting with the Emperour at a Banquet, and taking on him some earnest and speedy occasion to bee gone to some other place, hee rose from the Table, and pretending to take the Emperours hand to kisse, hee closely and stealingly tryed his Pulse, which <hi>Tiberius</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but not expressing so much, caused him to take his place againe, and the Banquet to bee renewed, and him to sit out the meale. But when the Doctor was got loose from the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and was come to <hi>Caius</hi> and <hi>Macro,</hi> and the rest of the adorers of that imperiall Sunne that was now waiting when hee should rise, hee resolved them that his end drew on apace, and was not many daies off: And then was all preparation for the new Emperour when the last gaspe should remove the old. But hee that had used so much dissimulation all his life dissembled even in his dying. For fainting and swooning so very sore, that all conceived hee was departed, and <hi>Caius</hi> and all his favorites were gone forth to take possession of his new Empire: suddenly the tune is turned, and newes comes forth that <hi>Tiberius</hi> is revived and calleth for meat: <hi>Macro</hi> that had often been his instrument of cruelty upon others, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

There are indeed diversities of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion about the manner of his death, some saying it was thus as is mentioned, others that it was by poyson, others that it was by being denied meat in the intermission of his fits, others that hee rose out of his bed and fell on the floore, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body being neere him: all which are mentioned by <hi>Suetonius.</hi> It is not much materiall what his end was, that that is first na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med is most intertained, and certainly it suiteth very well with his deservings, and it is some wonder that he came to such an

end no sooner. Hee died the seventeenth of the Calends of <hi>Aprill</hi> or the sixteenth of <hi>March,</hi> or if <hi>Dion</hi> may have his will the seventh, and so the rest of that yeer is accounted the first of <hi>Caius.</hi>

It may seeme incredible, that a worse disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should ever bee found then that of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> but the old Politician saw that this was so much beyond it, that it would doe him credit: some impute the fault to his bloody Nurse one <hi>Pressilla</hi> a <hi>Campanian,</hi> the custome of which country it was, that the women when they were to give their children suck, they first anointed the Nipple with the blood of an Hedg-hog, to the end their children might bee the more fierce and cruell.

For being brought up in the sight, and at the elbow of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> it would have served to have corrupted the best nature that could bee; but this of his was either never good, or at least was spoiled long before. Yet had he reasonably well learned his Tutors art of dissimulation, so that he hid those Serpentine conditions, not onely before <hi>Tiberius</hi> his death, but also a while after hee had obtained the Empire. Onely he that had taught him to weave this mantle of dissembling could spie through it, insomuch that he would professe, That <hi>Caius lived for the destruction of him and all others. And that hee hatched up a snake for the Roman Empire, and a Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton for all the world.</hi> And it proved so both to him and them. For when <hi>Tiberius</hi> lay a gasping stifled with a pillow prest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he also throtled him with his hand, and crucified one of his servants that cryed out upon the hideousnesse of the fact. And as for his demeanor toward the State, a little time will give too lamentable witnesse.</p>

                        <hi>Caius</hi> his beginnings were plausible and popular, dissembling his cursed dispositions under such crafty colours, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were transported with so happy a change (as they suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) and 160000 Sacrifices were slaine for gratulation in his three first moneths.

                     </p>
                     <p>Yet could hee not hide the ilnesse of his disposition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all these cloakes and coverts of dissembling; for present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his comming to the City, hee disanulled the will of <hi>Tiberius</hi> that hee might nullifie the authority of his partner of the same name in the rule and Empire: And yet did hee pay all the Legacies of old <hi>Tiberius</hi> with bountifull additions of

his owne, which shewed tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> hee disliked the will, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of partnership of <hi>Tiberius</hi> the younger. Having thus the whole sway and dominion devolved upon himselfe, by the outing of his poore Cousin (for the Senate was made and packed by <hi>Macro</hi> for such a purpose) hee was received with as much joy and applause, as was possible to expresse, upon the old memory of his father, and the present expectation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Nor was this jocundnesse confined in the narrow bonds of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> but dilated it selfe through all the Empire, in every corner where the hoped benefit, and happy fruit of so great an expectation would have come, had it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved right. Every Country, City and Town was poured forth into exultation and festivity, with a common joy in this common hope. Now could you have seen nothing but Altars, Offerings, Sacrifices, Feasts, Revels, Bankets, Playes, Dancings, merry Faces, crowned Heads, singing Tongues and joyfull Hearts, that the World seemed to bee ravished besides it selfe, &amp; all misery to bee banished out of it, and all the thoughts of a changing fortune utterly forgot. Had <hi>Tiberius</hi> but spyed this worke out of his Coffin, how would hee have laughed for company, to behold this deludednesse of the people, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation of the Prince? And thus lasted this musicke and masking for his first seven moneths, in which the new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour behaved himselfe with that moderation and bravery, as if vertue it selfe had been come among them.</p>
                     <p>In the eighth moneth a grievous sicknesse seized upon him, and then was all this mirth and melody turned to mourning and lamentation: each man sorrowfull, and women bemoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as if all the world had been sicke as well as hee. Now were their songs turned into teares, their revelling into pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and their festivalls to Vows for his recovery. Nay, so far did some straine the expression of their affections, that they vowed their heads and lives for his restoring. Nor could the people bee so much blamed for this their sorrow, as pityed for being thus deceived, nor could it so much bee wondred at that they were deceived, as it was wonderfull that hee could so deceive.

When hee paid the Legacies of <hi>Tiberius,</hi>) hee also discharged those of <hi>Iulia</hi> which <hi>Tiberius</hi> had stopped, and added a considerable summe of his own bounty: Hee gathered the ashes of his mother and brother, and committed them to their Urne with his owne hands, choosing a tempestuous season purposely when hee travailed about that businesse, that his piety might bee blowne about the more; and hee instituted annuall festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valls for them. Nor must his father <hi>Germanicus</hi> be forgotten, nor indeed could he, nor did hee deserve it, for his memory therefore would hee have the moneth <hi>September</hi> to bee called by his name, placing him in the Calendar next <hi>Augustus.</hi> His Grandmother <hi>Antonia</hi> hee also dignified and deified equally with <hi>Livia</hi>; and that by the consent and decree of the Senate. His Uncle <hi>Claudius</hi> hee honoured with partnership with him in the Consulship; and his brother and partner <hi>Tiberius,</hi> with adoption to put him in future hopes now hee had lost his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent ones; and hee titled him <hi>The Prince of the Youth,</hi> to stop his mouth belike, when hee had put him beside his being the Prince of Men. But as for his Sisters, the sequel shewed that it was more doting and lust then pure brotherly affection, that caused him to shew these expressions: that in all oaths that were administred to any, this must bee one clause to which they must sweare, <hi>That they neither accounted themselves nor their children, dearer then</hi> Caius <hi>and his Sisters</hi>: and this in all the Records of the Consuls, <hi>Which bee for the happinesse of</hi> Caius <hi>and his Sisters, &amp;c.</hi> The like popularity used hee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to the people, releasing the condemned, and recalling the banished; condemning on the contrary all enormities in Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, and banishing all incentives to evill manners. Forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his own private grievances, and satisfying for injuries done by his Predecessors; that it was no marvaile if the whole State were sick in the sicknesse of such a Prince.</p>

                     <p>The recovery of the Emperour <hi>Caius,</hi> from that disease under which wee left him ere while, proved the sicknesse of the whole State, and the death of divers.

Nor was his cruelty any whit lesse, though for very shame it must be better dissembled, to his Father in Law the noble <hi>Silanus.</hi> A man hated of him for the two maine things that in humane society are the eyes of love, vertue, and alliance, and so indignly used him, that hee found no way to regain his love, nor any better to avoid his hate then to murder him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

with his own hands. <hi>Claudia</hi> the daughter of <hi>Silanus</hi> was his wife, but hee divorced her from him, and took <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia Orestilla,</hi> from her husband <hi>Calpurnius Piso,</hi> on their very wedding day, where hee was present at the solemnization, and hee kept her not two months, but sent her to her <hi>Piso</hi> again.</p>

Hee is commanded to die by his own hand, though Tribunes, Centurions, and men of warre fitter farre to have done such an execution stood by and would have done it. He desired but this mercy, that hee might have been slain by some of them, but that was denyed him upon a point of Honor and Justice forsooth, because it was not fit that such a Prince should dye by inferiour hands. The poor Prince offered his neck to every one that stood neare, but they durst not strike for feare of their own: The onely favour that hee could obtaine was this, that they might teach him where to wound himselfe for his soonest dispatch, and so hee did. And thus is the Tyrant delivered as he thinketh from all feare and danger of compartnership and corrivality in the Empire: next will he take a course with those that any way may crosse him in, or advise him against his headlong humors, and of them wee shall heare in their course. The last six months of this year he had taken the Consulship upon himself, and had chosen his Uncle <hi>Claudius</hi> for his colleague, but wee have reserved the names of the old till now, to avoid confusion.</p>

                     <p>These beginnings had answerable sequels, for <hi>Caius</hi> addicted himselfe wholly to bloodinesse, sometimes for his sports, sometimes in cruell earnest: Hee commanded sword plaies to bee made, in which hee set not man to man, but multitudes to multitudes to slaughter each other: Hee slew in the same manner six and twentie Roman Knights, with great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken by him in the effusion of their blood: Hee set also another Knight to the same terrible sports, and when hee came off victorious, hee caused him, and his father to bee slaine, and divers others with them inclosing them in a strong Chest or Presse: When once there were not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It cannot bee expected that hee should come to a good end himselfe, that had brought so many to a bad. His course is now come to tast of the same sauce that he had provided for so many others, and it would halfe move the spectator to some kind of pity to see him slaughtered for such a cause as hee was slaughtered for. How hee had been a meanes to curry <hi>Caius</hi> favour with <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and to skrew him into the Empire and himselfe into his good opinion, even by the prostitution of his own wife, wee have heard before, and this his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary officiousnesse, hee did not forelet or slacken, when hee had brought him where hee desired to have him, to the Empire. But now hee turned his observance a better way, and what hee had done before by basenesse, flattery, and senselesse obsequious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to bring him to the rule, hee changeth into good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell to keep him well in it. For when hee saw him fall asleepe at Banquets amongst his cups, hee would freely check him for it, as being neither for his credit nor for his safety. The like would hee doe when hee saw him misbehave himselfe by light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, profuse laughter, and ridiculous gestures in the theater, and in beholding of plaies: In briefe, so round and plaine was hee with him when hee saw just cause, that in fine the uncoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selable humorist became his enemy, and at last his death.

For when hee heard of the death of the old Emperour and the succession of the new, sorrow for the one, and feare of the other did so transport him besides himselfe, that forgetting the bravery and glory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee had governed hitherto, hee let loose the reines of himselfe to these two passions, and the reines of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to desperate carelesnesse and neglect. Hee did nothing but weepe for the losse of old <hi>Tiberius,</hi> to whom hee had been very intimate and deare, and hee might well weep the more, because hee could meet hardly with any that would beare any part and share in that sorrow with him. This his griefe was augmented by the feare that hee had of <hi>Caius</hi> and of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, and that by the intelligence that his conscience gave him that hee had deserved it: partly for his propensitie to young <hi>Tiberius</hi> and siding with him, but chiefely because he had had some hand or at least some consent and inclination to the death of <hi>Agrippina, Caius</hi> his mother. Both these his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable passions were brought to their height when hee heard of the death of young <hi>Tiberius</hi> and of his old friend <hi>Macro.</hi> The thought of these two was the onely comfort hee had against his dejectednesse and discontent, for all his hope was, that these two might make his peace with <hi>Caius,</hi> whose dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure hee so much doubted: But what must hee doe now,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59068:115"/>

Hee had a standing statue of gold erected for him, to represent his walking Deitie, which was clothed with the same garbe that hee wore himselfe every day, and to this were offered daily sacrifices as rare and new found out as was his Deity it selfe, Peacocks, Pheasants, and other birds of the greatest raritie and value. So vaine a thing is man deserted and left unto himselfe, that hee will bee a God when hee is in the next forme unto a Devill.

crowded, starved, and distressed people, those that had any hope or courage to shift for themselves, streake abroad and steale forth of their inclosure, for food and fresh aire; some to the shore, some into the Citie, some one way, some another, but the misery of them also was no lesse then theirs that staid impounded, but that it was not so lingring. For wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they were caught, as no where could they goe but descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they were either stoned, clubbed, or burned to death, yea often man, wife, children and whole families so murdred all of a heape. Some they smoaked and choaked to death in a fire where they wanted fewell to burne them out, some they haled with ropes tied about their ankles, up and downe the streets till they were dead, and then neither spared they the dead bodies, but mangled them in peeces. Their Synagogues they all burnt downe, with the losse also of some of the <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrians</hi> houses adjoyning, their houses they defaced, and their lives they tooke away, when and wheresoever they could catch them. <hi>Flaccus</hi> in this bloodinesse, had done enough by connivence and toleration, but hee is not content with this passive tyranny unlesse hee bee an actor himself in the Scene, and bee not behind other in this mischiefe, as hee was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in authority. Eight and thirty of their Judges and Counsellors (for a Senate of their owne was tolerated by <hi>Augustus</hi> and allowed them) hee sendeth for by his officers, and binding their hands behind them causeth them thus to bee led along the streets for a derision, and then caused them to bee publickly scourged, some to death, some to the lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring out of a miserable life. Hee caused also a pretended search to bee made throughout all the Jews houses for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, pretending a suspition of their insurrection, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thereby to give the Souldiers the more advantage for their pillaging and oppression. Hee spared neither age nor sex against whom hee could take an occasion or find cavill, nor reverenced hee any festivall for their execution, nor omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any kind of cruelty for their torture. Here is the first smarting blow to count of that this nation felt, since they

A man, the shame and confusion of men, if hee may bee called a man, and so far beyond the vices of any that had gone before, that hee seemed to live to no other purpose then to shew, what the utmost extent of vitiousnesse could doe in the utmost height of power and libertie. You would wonder, but that his defiance of the Gods doth lessen that wonder, how scornefully and despitefully hee used the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and persons of his ancestors, sisters, kindred and best friends: Hee charged <hi>Augustus</hi> with incest, <hi>Livia</hi> with base birth, <hi>Tiberius</hi> but with what hee deserved, his owne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with bastardize, and whosoever was most neere and most honour to him, with some ignominy and reproach or other. But such words were curtesies in comparison of his actions. All his sisters hee first deflowred, and then prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted them to others being so deflowred. But his darling si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Drusilla,</hi> sped somewhat better, if that better were not
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59068:119"/>
as bad. To her hee continued his affection, of love or lust whether you will, while shee continued in life, and when shee was dead, hee made her the meanes of his profit as hee had done before of his pleasure; shee was the wife of <hi>M. Lapidus,</hi> but still the whore of her brother <hi>Caius,</hi> and after her death hee made her a Goddesse, whom all her life long hee had made his harlot. Altars, statues, vowes, festivals were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for her, and <hi>Livius Geminius</hi> played the knight o'th post, and swore devoutly that hee saw her ascend to heaven, and conversing with the Gods. Such a Deitie had the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans never knowne before, but onely her brother, and shee troubled them as much in her heaven, as hee did on the earth. For now was it impossible for any man so to behave himselfe, but hee was intrapped on the one hand or the other, about this new found Goddesse. To mourne for her death, it was criminall, because shee was a Deity; and to rejoyce for her Deity was capitall, because shee was dead, so that betwixt this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> of pietie, teares and devotion, that man was very wary indeed that suffered not inhumanity and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. For to laugh, feast, bath, sing or dance was mortall, because the Emperours sister and darling was dead, and yet to mourne, or sorrow for her death was as deadly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause shee was immortall. This last stale did hee make of this his deceased sister, when shee would now serve him for no other use, that both sorrow for her mortalitie, and joy for her being immortall did alike bring in money to his treasures, (which were now almost drained of his many millions) either by bribes for the saving of the life of some, or by confiscation upon the Death of others.</p>
                     <p>But how must hee doe now for another Paramour after his deare <hi>Drusilla</hi>? Why, that needeth not to breed any great difficultie, when his unbridled lust is not very curious of his choice, and his as unbridled power might choose as it list. Hee first married <hi>Lollia Paullina</hi> the wife of <hi>C. Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius,</hi> sending for her from another country where her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was Generall of the Army, and all the reason of this
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59068:120"/>
his choice was, because hee was told that her grandmother was an exceeding great beauty; but hee soone put her away againe, and forbad that any should touch her for ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. Next came <hi>Caeso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this his behaviour is nothing in comparison of that which followed. Hee slew divers of the Senate, and yet afterward cited them to appeare as if they had been alive, and in the end pretended that they had died by their owne hands, others came off with a scourging, and so they escaped with life, but hee caused the Souldiers to tread on them as they lay, and as they whipped them that they might have them at the more command: And thus hee used some of all rankes and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

One of the masters of his games that had offended him, he kept in chaines, and caused him to bee beaten every day before his face, till the offensivenesse and stench of his wounded braine obtained his death: A Roman Knight being cast by him to the wild beasts, and crying out of the injustice done to him, hee caused to bee taken out againe, and his tongue to bee cut out, and then hee cast him to them againe. Hee caused all the banished men that were in the Ilands about <hi>Italy</hi> to bee slaine at once, because having asked one that was banished in the time of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> what hee did all the time of his exile, and hee answered, <hi>that hee prayed continually for the death of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius and the succession of Caius,</hi> hee thought that all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent exiles prayed for his death likewise.

                           <p>
                              <hi>Luke,</hi> saith hee, <hi>being intent (as it appeareth) to commend to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory the more remarkable miracles wrought by Peter, hath omitted in silence the rest of his actions performed in this visitation of the province, and among other things, the institution of the Church of Antioch: which that it was erected by him in this very yeer, wee shall easily shew by the testimony of the ancients. Eusebius</hi> may bee alledged as one of these ancients, and one for all, who speaketh much to the same purpose, and somewhat fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but onely with this difference that hee hath set downe this matter a little before the death of <hi>Tiberius. Peter the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi> saith hee, <hi>founded the Church of Antioch, and having there got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his chaire bee sate five and twenty yeers.</hi> Thus <hi>Eusebius ad an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Christ.</hi> 38. <hi>Parisiis,</hi> 1511. Now to take up this position and story in its severall particulars, almost every parcell will prove a stumbling block, and before beleefe can bee given to it, it must passe thorow, and overcome these difficulties.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Whereas his journey to <hi>Antioch</hi> is laid in this visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: it is strained beyond the letter, and beyond the Spirit and meaning of the Text. For that speaketh onely of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Iudea, Galilee,</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> and then how came in <hi>Antioch</hi> in another country? And those words <hi>through all quarters</hi> run at a very uncertaine randome if they bee uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribed by the Verse before.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. It is past all peradventure that as yet there was no Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> at all, much more that there was no Episcopall Chaire and See there. For it is a yeer yet to come before there be any mention of a Church there, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. and that that story of the first beginning of that Church lieth in its proper place
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59068:123"/>
and time without any transposition or <hi>Hysteron-proteron</hi> is so plaine to him that will but view it that it needeth no proof.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. How is it consistent with <hi>Peters</hi> imprisonment at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> Chap. 12. to sit Bishop in another country? Much more is it inconsistent, or rather to speak plainly, impossible that he should fit five and twenty yeers at <hi>Antioch</hi> and as many at <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet goe thither in the second of <hi>Claudius</hi> as hee is held to have done. Now <hi>Baronius</hi> hath espied these two stumbling blocks, and laboreth to remove them: but in his striving about the one, hee throweth dirt into <hi>Eusebius</hi> his best Authors face, for hee saith hee is corrupted; and indeed hee doth little lesse about the other: For whereas <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith in plaine termes, <hi>ibi sedit, Peter there sate,</hi> this his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrast glosseth, that it sufficed though hee never came there; For with him <hi>Peter</hi> was as a Creator of Churches and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks; for if <hi>dixit factum est</hi> if hee but spake the word, bee hee where hee would, there was a <hi>Metropolis</hi> or an Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy created in any place whatsoever. But not to spend much labour where wee are sure but of little profit, let it suffice the reader to have but a Catalogue and particular of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; let him censure them according to his own judgment.</p>
                           <p>Argum. 1. <hi>It was Peters office to oversee and take care of the whole stock, and for this hee visited all the Churches that lay round about Ierusalem,</hi> pag. 306. But that draweth on another que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, which will bee harder to prove then this, and it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <hi>Paul</hi> but an intruder, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Arg. 3. <hi>Peter wheresoever hee was might raise an Episcopall or metropoliticall See at any place distant where hee pleased, by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie wherewith hee was indewed, pag.</hi> 309. When this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, wee may beleeve the other that hee would prove.</p>
                           <p>Arg. 4. <hi>The number of Eusebius, of his sitting</hi> 25. <hi>yeers at Antioch, is an error crept into the Text, but the number of his</hi> 25. <hi>yeers at Rome,

                     <p>First, the Gospel had now dilated it selfe to the very utmost bounds of the Jews territories in <hi>Canaan, Iudea, Samaria,</hi> and <hi>Galilee,</hi> had been preached to, and through, and now is it got to the very walls of their dominions round about: And there wanteth nothing but laying the partition wall flat, that the Gospel may get out unto the Gentiles: and that is done in this Chapter; where the great partition and distance that was betwixt Jew and Gentile is utterly removed and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by God himselfe, who had first pitched and set it betwixt them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="229" facs="tcp:59068:125"/>Secondly, the two first and mainest stones of interposition that were laid in this wall, were <hi>circumcision</hi> and <hi>diet:</hi> the one in the time of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. the other in the time of <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 32.32. And in reference to these two it is, that they of the Circumcision contend with <hi>Peter,</hi> upon his returne to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> for they are grieved that <hi>hee went in to men uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and ate with them, chap.</hi> 11.3. These were the proper di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishers betwixt <hi>Israel</hi> and other Nations; for all their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ceremonies were not so much to distinguish them from other people, as to compose them among themselves and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, they being first distinguished from others by these.</p>
                     <p>Of these two, singularity of Dyet, or Prohibition of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine meates, was the more proper differencer, and the more strict distinctive: For all the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and so in regard of that Ceremony, there was no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt an <hi>Ismaelite</hi> and a <hi>Iew</hi>: But abstaining from such and such meates, was a <hi>proprium quarto modo,</hi> a singularity that differenced an <hi>Israelite</hi> from all the world besides.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, therefore it was most proper, and of most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine reason, that the liberty of eating any meates, did denote and shew a liberty of conversing with any nation, and that the inlarging of the one, is the inlarging of the other.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the first-fruits of this inlargement, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment beyond the partition wall is <hi>Cornelius,</hi> a Convert, but not a Proselyte: a man that was already come into God, but not come in to the Church of <hi>Israel:</hi> a man as farre contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily qualified for such a businesse, in all humane appearance, as what could bee most contrary, as being a Roman, a Souldier, a Centurion; and yet hee of all men chosen to bee the first-fruits of the Gentiles, that God herein might bee the more plainly shewed to bee no respecter of persons.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, it had been now 2210 yeares since the Heathen were cast off at the confusion of <hi>Babel,</hi> and had lain so long in darknesse, sin, superstition and idolatry, strangers to God, and aliens from the congregation of <hi>Israel</hi>; bondslaves of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> and under his dominion, and even all the world (<hi>Israel</hi>
                        <pb n="230" facs="tcp:59068:126"/>
onely excepted) become the kingdome of hell and the Devill.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, <hi>Satan</hi> had by this very time brought his kingdome among these heathens to the very <hi>Apex</hi> and perfection, when hee had gotten one into the throne of the Roman Empire, (which was now over all the world) who by the very sword and power will force the people to adore him for a God, and had the sword and power in his owne hand to force them to adore him: as wee saw by <hi>Caius</hi> even now. And here I cannot but looke backe from <hi>Caius</hi> as hee sate in his throne as an ungodly Deity when the Gentiles began to bee called in, to the first Idoll that they proposed and set up for themselves to adore at <hi>Babel,</hi> as hee is described by the <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem Targum</hi> at their first casting off: For thus doth it Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase those Rebels plot and conspiracy, for the building of that Idolatrous Citie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.3. <hi>And they said, Come let us build a Citie and a tower, whose top may reach to heaven, and in the midst of it, let us build a Chappell, and an Idol in the head of it with a sword in his hand to fight for us that wee be not scattered.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor can I but looke forward also from the same <hi>Caius</hi> Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying himselfe, and that in the Temple of God as wee shall see ere long, to the succeeding times of the Gentile Church, which is now beginning: wherein a man of sinne, the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor of <hi>Caius Caligula</hi> a thousand fold more likely, then the successor of <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> hath set up himselfe to be adored, and exalts himself above every thing that is called God.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, the instrument of the first introducing of the Gentiles, by the bringing in of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> was <hi>Peter</hi>: not for any Primacy or universall Bishopship that hee was invested withall, but rather because hee was the most singular mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Circumcision: for his bringing in of the Gentiles would stop the mouth of the Judaizing beleevers the more.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, and for this thing hee had a speciall ingagement and deputation from our Saviour a good while agoe as hee himselfe speaketh, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.7. And that was, when Christ gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him <hi>the keyes of the kingdome of heaven, Matth.</hi> 16.19. that is, putteth into his hand, the peculiar priviledge to open the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59068:126"/>
doore of faith and the Gospel to the Gentiles, and giveth him power withall to bind and to loose, the use of <hi>Moses</hi> Law among the Heathens when hee brought the Gospell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, some of it to fall and some to stand, according as the Spirit should direct him, and accordingly it should bee ratified in heaven. And that this is the genuine, proper and onely meaning of that so much disputed place, will bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable to him that shall consider what is the proper meaning of <hi>the kingdome of heaven</hi> in Scripture, and <hi>of binding and loosing</hi>

                           <p>This vision that <hi>Peter</hi> had, when this satisfaction was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, to learne to call nothing common, was onely of beasts and fowles and creeping things, yet might hee learne that the lesson was also to bee understood of men, because the distinction between men and men in regard of common and uncleane was first made and most strictly made by the difference betwixt meats and meats. For the very first distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisher that ever began to inclose <hi>Israel</hi> for a peculiar from other people, was the not eating of the smew that shrank, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. Circumcision distinguished the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> from
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59068:129"/>
other people, but this began to distinguish <hi>Israel</hi> from the other seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And it is observable, that that cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or distinctive rite was first taken up, when <hi>Iacob</hi> first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the name of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now it is true indeed that their forbearing to eate the smew that shranke, was not as if they accounted it common or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, but it was in regard of the honorable memoriall that they read upon it, yet was that ceremony the first and proper distinguisher of an Israelite from all other people under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven some hundreds of yeeres, till more distinctive rites came in, and more things were prohibited to bee eaten, for the surer distinction.</p>
                           <p>There was distinction of cleane and uncleane beasts before the flood, as appeareth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.8. but this was in reference to sacrifice onely, and not in reference to diet at all: for till the flood they ate nothing but the fruits of the ground, till God gave <hi>Noah</hi> libertie to eate flesh, and to eate any thing that was wholesome for diet. And in this libertie did the world continue till the Law given at <hi>Sinai,</hi> save onely an Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites not eating the smew that shranke: And this libertie some Jewes themselves confesse shall be in the dayes of <hi>Messias,</hi> which now first taketh place at this vision of <hi>Peter</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. And here doth <hi>Peter</hi> begin to put in use and ure that power of <hi>binding and loosing</hi> which Christ had put into his hands, when hee put into his hands the <hi>keyes of the kingdome of heaven</hi>: And this very place doth so cleerly expound and interpret that speech of our Saviour to him, that it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ever there should bee such scruple and controversie about it.</p>
                           <p>For, 1. Here beginneth <hi>the kingdome of heaven</hi>: when the Gentiles are received to savour and to the Gospell, who had been so long cast off, and laine in ignorance and idolatry, and when no difference is made betwixt them and the Jewes any longer, but of every nation, they that feare God and worke righteousnesse are accepted of him as well as <hi>Israel.</hi> This is the very first beginning or dawning to the kingdome
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59068:129"/>
of heaven; and so it grew on more and more, till <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was destroyed, and then was the perfect day, when the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles onely were become the Church of Christ, and no Church or Commonwealth of <hi>Israel</hi> to bee had at all, but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed and ruined.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, here <hi>Peter hath the keyes of the Kingdome,</hi> and unlocketh the doore for the Gentiles to come in to the faith &amp; Gospel, which till now had bin shut and they kept out. And <hi>Peter</hi> onely had the keys, and none of the Apostles or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples but hee: for though they from hence forward brought in Gentiles daily in to the Kingdome of Heaven, by conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to the Gospel; yet it was hee that first and onely opened the doore, and the doore being once opened, was never shut, nor ever shall be till the end of the world. And this was all the priority that <hi>Peter</hi> had before the other Apostles, if it were any priority; and how little this concerneth <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Papacy, as to be any foundation of it, a childe may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. <hi>Peter</hi> here looseth the greatest strictnesse, and what was the straitest bound up of any thing that was in all the policy of <hi>Moses</hi> and customes of the Jews, and that was, the <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of cleane and uncleane</hi> in the legall sense.

one to the communion of another, yet the proper object of this loosing that is loosed by <hi>Peter,</hi> was that Law or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that tied them up: and so concerning the eating of those things that had been prohibited, it is true indeed that the Jewes were let loose henceforward to the use of them in diet and to eate what they thought good, but this loosing was not so properly of the men, as the loosing of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition that had bound them before. And this could bee no way but doctrinally by teaching that Christian libertie that was given by the Gospel.</p>
                           <p>Now though <hi>Peter</hi> onely, and none but hee <hi>had the keyes of the Kingdome</hi> of heaven, yet had all the Apostles the <hi>power of binding and loosing</hi> as well as hee: and so have all the Ministers of the Gospel as well as they, and all in the lame sense, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doctrinally to teach what is bound and loose, or lawfull and unlawfull, but not in the same kinde: for the Apostles having the constant and unerring assistance of the holy Ghost, did nullifie by their doctrine, some part of <hi>Moses</hi> Law, as to the use of it, as Circumcision, Sacrifices, Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>This matter therefore of <hi>Cornelius</hi> his calling in, as the first-fruits of the Gentiles, is a thing that deserves very high regard and consideration; as in which are included and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved so many things of note as have been mentioned, and divers others that might bee added thereunto; and in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the matter, the time of it is not to bee neglected, which to the serious and considerate Reader and weigher of things in the ballance of judgement, will appeare to bee in this yeare in which wee have laid it; especially, that being concluded upon, which before wee proved undeniable, that the Famine was in the second yeare of <hi>Claudius.</hi> And this time is the rather to bee looked upon, because that some doe foolishly misconstrue a clause in <hi>Daniel</hi> 9.27. by missing of the right time of this occurrence of <hi>Cornelius.</hi> For looking

A policy above his reach, howsoever hee came to it, to shake the chiefe Magistracy by so often changes, that his own power might stand the surer. Both in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulship, and after it, hee behaved himselfe after his wonted manner of barbarousnesse and cruelty, but that now hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to adde one vice more to his cruelty in bloodinesse, namely intolerable covetousnesse and oppression. Now, saith <hi>Dion,</hi> was nothing but slaughter: For many of the Nobles were condemned, many perished by the Sword-playes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny imprisoned by the late Emperour <hi>Tiberius,</hi> were drawne to execution. Now did hee bend himselfe to crosse the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the people being thorowly incensed began to crosse him. The maine causes of this his displeasure (guesse how weighty) were such as these: Because they came not to the Playes and Shewes so constantly, and at such constant times as hee had appointed: because sometimes when they came, they liked such sports as hee liked not, <hi>&amp; contra</hi>: And because they once extolling him, called him by the title of young <hi>Augustus.</hi> For such occasions as these (behold the madnesse of a man self-willed) he brake out into all cruelty, slaying ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at the Theater for the one fault, and many as they went home for the other, and many at their own homes, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59068:132"/>
for a third. And now was his rage growne so high, that <hi>hee wished that all the City had but one head, that hee might strike it off at one blow</hi>; and bewailed his times, for that they had not been enfamoused with some notable misery of the Roman State, as was the Reigne of <hi>Augustus</hi> with the overthrow of <hi>Varus</hi> and his Army in <hi>Germany</hi>; and the Reigne of <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> with the slaughter of above twenty thousand men by the fall of an <hi>Amphitheater</hi> at <hi>Fidenae.</hi> And that wee may take a full view of his cruell words and actions here together, (the Reader I hope will not bee punctuall in expecting an exact or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of time in this disorder of conditions) his common reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution against the people always was, <hi>Let them hate mee and spare not, so that they fear me.</hi> But what was his anger think you, when his very feasts and imbraces of his minions were mixed with cruelty? hee used to have men tortured in his presence as hee sate at meat, mingling his sauce as it were with innocents blood. At a great feast to which hee had invited the two Consuls, hee suddenly fell out into an extreme laughter, and upon demand of his reason, his answer was, <hi>Because hee had power to take away their two heads whensoever hee pleased.</hi> And whensoever hee was kissing the neck of his wife or paramour, hee would constantly adde these words, but cruelly amorous, <hi>This necke, as faire as it is, when I command shall bee cut off.</hi> Such was his jesting; and as for his earnest, I suppose you will easily beleeve, that it was proportionable. Whereas hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, hee had been very free and lavish of his tongue in dispraising <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and not onely had not checked, but also countenanced, and taken delight in those that spake ill of him, as well as hee; hee now turneth his tune, and breaketh out as fluently into his commendations: pleading that hee himselfe had liberty to say what hee list, but accusing those that had assumed the like liberty, when as no such thing belonged to them. Then did hee cause a list or catalogue to bee read of those that had been executed and put to death under <hi>Tiberius</hi>; laying withall the death of the most of them to the charge of the Senate, and accused some for accusing them, others for
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59068:133"/>
witnessing against them, and all, for condemning them. These things hee alledged out of those books which in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his reigne and in the time of his seeming goodnesse, hee professed that hee had burnt: and after a most bitter and terrible speech now made among them in the Senate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving an act of treason for speaking against the Prince, hee suddainly departed out of the Senate and the Citie. In what case the Senate and the people were, that were guilty of either words or actions, that hee had charged them withall, it is readily guessed, but how they shall come off, and what they shall doe to escape, is not easily to bee resolved. Their presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test helpe is to fawne and speake faire, and that course they take, praising him infinitely at their next meeting, for his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and piousnesse, and giving him as infinite thankes that hee suffered them to live, and decreeing that sacrifices should be offered annually to his clemency on that very day that those charges were published against so many, seeking to appease his senselesse and foolish anger by as senselesse and foolish a pacification. But how little they could sacrifice, or pray or praise him into any better mind then hee hath been in hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, you shall see by the sequell.</p>

Hee would invite the great men and their Ladies to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and as the women passed by him in way of salutation he would earnestly and leasurely view them, <hi>mercantium more,</hi> saith my author, as they doe that are to buy any thing, and if any matron for modesty held downe her head, hee would lift it up, that hee might have his full survey: shee that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him, hee tooke into a retiring roome and adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and presently would hee bring her forth againe, and tell openly whether shee had given him content or no.

joyned monstrous workes and machinations, which shewed at once, his folly in their undertaking, and the vastnesse of his power in their performance: As levelling mountaines to even the plaine, and in other places filling up the plaine to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall mountains; sometimes causing rocks of flint to be cut thorough, to make a passage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and sometimes foundations of houses or walls to be laid in the bottome of the Sea, bringing soile and rubbish to fill up the place and to make it firme ground: ambitious to bring to passe seeming impossibilities, and cruelly hasty in the accomplishing of what hee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke, punishing the slacking of the work with certaine death.</p>

                     <p>In the list of these his vanities, and ungodly wayes of spending, let his bridge betweene <hi>Puteoli</hi> and <hi>Bauli,</hi> come in the first place, or else you doe it some injury. These two places were about three miles and a halfe distant, an arme of the Sea of that breadth, severing them, and lying between. The ambition of the vaine Emperour was to ride on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back and in his chariot betweene these two places: What his fancy or Phrenzy rather, was, that stirred up such a humour in him, is diversly related, and it is no great matter to inquire after it. Some say it was, that he might terrifie <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Britaine</hi> against whom hee intended hostilitie, with the very rumour of so great a worke: others, that hee might imitate, or rather excell <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who made a bridge of ships over the Hellespont. But the rumour of it at Court, where his mind was likeliest to bee best knowne, was, that hee did it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of a prediction of <hi>Thrasyllus,</hi> who had told <hi>Tiberius</hi> that <hi>Caius should no more rule then ride over the bay of Baiae on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back. Dion</hi> guesseth this to have been his reason, that whereas the Senate upon their feare and fawning mentioned before had decreed an <hi>Ovation</hi> for him, or a kind of triumphant riding on horseback, hee thought it too poore a thing to ride so by
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59068:134"/>
land, and therefore invented this tricke of his owne vaine head, to ride so by Sea. For this purpose, all the ships that could bee got were sent for in, and when they were not enow, others were made and so they all were set two and two linked together till they made a bridge of that three miles and a halfe long: Then caused hee an infinite number of workmen to carry on earth, and make a causey like the <hi>Appian</hi> roade over all those ships from the continent to the Iland. (If this were not a <hi>Pontifex Romanus</hi> with a witnesse, let all men judge.) When his deere bought way was thus prepared, hee prepares for it and for his Phantastick journey over it: His garbe in which hee would ride was this: Hee put a brestplate on, which he said had beene <hi>Alexanders,</hi> and over that a rich purple robe, then his sword and buckler, and an oken garland about his head: and having sacrificed to <hi>Neptune</hi> and to the other Gods, and even to the Deity <hi>Envy,</hi> lest the bridge should miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hee sets forth on horsebacke with a great troope of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men men attending him, and takes his strange and idle voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. When hee had riden thus one day on horsebacke, hee returnes the next day in his Chariot, with an infinite traine of his friends in Coaches, of souldiers in armes, and of the common people lookers on, and among others of state <hi>Darius</hi> an hostage of <hi>Parthia</hi> attended his Chariot; when hee had done this great exploit, of walking, riding and coaching so many miles upon the Sea, hee getteth up into a Desk which was made upon this new-found bridge on purpose, and there maketh a solemne speech in commendation of this his great attempt, and of the souldiers and workmens paines and care about it; And when hee had done hee bestowed a large mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence among them. And the rest of that day and the night that followed, he spent in feasting and banqueting in banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting houses that hee had made purposely upon his bridge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee would make the Sea a perfect roade. Into these hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses hee had brought fresh water in Pipes from the shore to serve the occasions of this nights feast, if hee will suffer one to call it night. For hee that had turned the Sea into a Coach-way,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59068:135"/>
way, was ambitious also to turne night into day; that in him might bee shewed at once both how foolish hee may prove that hath once let goe the reines of reason, and how bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse that folly is when it is backed with power. The ships that made the bridge were set in manner of a crescent, and so went the rode: upon it hee caused a great number of fires to bee made, and so upon the mountaines all about, that what had beene his Coach-way by day was now at night become his <hi>Amphitheater.</hi> But is is strange that wee heare of no murder of all this while among all this madnesse, for if <hi>Caius</hi> bee not cruell hee is not <hi>Caligula.</hi> After this his intertainment of his friends and of the company, hee suddainly cast a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of them into the Sea, and when they laid hold of rudders or any thing that might succour and save their lives, hee caused them to bee thrust away and so they perished.</p>
                     <p>Answerable to the vanities of this his bridge, had hee also Ships and Frigots to saile in for his owne recreation, in which were baths, vineyards and orchards that sailed with him, that as upon his bridge hee went over the Sea by land, so in his ships when hee went by Sea, the land went with him.</p>

                     <p>It is not so much wonder that these courses wasted the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours treasures, as it is how they have held out so long: And now that all his wealth is emptied and gone, he can find as strange and unheard of meanes to fetch in more as hee had found out to consume the old. He now began to accuse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne and execute apace, that hee might bee dealing with their goods in confiscation. So died <hi>Calvisius Sabinus, Titius Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Iunius Priscus,</hi> for no other reall fault but onely for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rich. But why should I reckon them by one and one, when at one clap hee condemned forty men together, and when hee came into his Chamber hee bragged to <hi>Caesonia</hi> his darling Lemman, <hi>Behold how much I have done in the time that thou art taking a nap at noone</hi> but this feate of condemning would
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59068:135"/>
not bring in money fast enough, therefore as there were more wayes of spending then one, so must there also bee of getting. Hee inventeth new taxes and payments, strange exactions and imposts, suffering nothing to passe in common use, but it must bring some tribute unto his treasures. Hee set a rate to bee paid him out of all meat that was eaten, a rate out of every sute or action for debt, a rate out of the porters gaines, nay a rate out of the whores hire. Hee made men that were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready free of the Citie to buy their freedome againe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that had named him for their heire when they should die, hee poisoned, that hee might inherit their estate sooner: And these his exploits hee used not onely in <hi>Rome,</hi> but when mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was scarce there, hee went into <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> and set up the same trade of polling there: Hee sold the Jewels, the goods, and the very servants of his condemned sisters; nay the very Jewels of the Crowne, as the royall robes and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Antony, Augustus, Iulia, Antonia,</hi> and others of the princely blood. And to conclude all in one, he set up a stewes in his owne Palace, and had women there of all sorts and sizes, and his panders went about to fetch in whoremaster customers: and all this was done, because it was for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours profit. He also made the Palace a common dicing house, and himselfe was the master gaimster; cogging, cheating, lying, forswearing, and doing any thing to make himselfe a gainer. Having once left another to play his game, and being gone downe into the court of the palace, hee saw two rich knights passing by, and caused them suddainly to bee apprehended, and their goods to bee confiscated, and returned to his game againe, bragging <hi>that hee had had an exceeding good throw.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time at play, wanting money to maintaine his stake, hee went downe and caused divers rich Nobles to bee slaine, and returned presently againe, saying, <hi>You sit here playing for a few pence, and I since I went, have gotten six hundred thousand se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterces.</hi>

And then cast hee himselfe at the tyrants feet, and begged for mercy, avowing that hee dreaded him more as an Orator then as <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar.</hi> The Lion growes mild upon this fawning, and turnes his malice and spleene into pride and vaineglory, rejoycing that hee had so overcome <hi>Domitius</hi> in eloquence, whereas <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitius</hi> had more cause to rejoyce that hee had so overcome him by silence.</p>

You may remember that not long since wee left Her and her <hi>Herod</hi> (for husband I may not call him) shipped for <hi>Rome</hi> to purchase, if possible, the Emperours good respect, and with that, an augmentation of their dignity and dominion. <hi>Agrippa,</hi> knowing of this their journey, and suspecting that as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in envy and emulation to him, so would it terminate, if they could compasse it, to his disadvantage, hee sendeth his servant <hi>Fortunatus</hi> after them with letters to the Emperor, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because himselfe was not yet at leasure to come, or in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy trying how his letters would speed and bee entertained before hee ventured his owne person. At <hi>Baiae</hi> they all met before <hi>Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Agrippaes</hi> complaint by writing meeteth theirs by word of mouth. Hee layeth to <hi>Herods</hi> charge, confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with <hi>Seianus</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> and with <hi>Artabanus</hi> in <hi>Parthia,</hi> and an armory and magazine at his owne home, sufficient to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish 7000. men, all which laid together could not but breed a just suspition of his revolting. <hi>Herod</hi> not being able upon questioning, to deny the last thing that hee was charged withall about his armes, gave <hi>Caius</hi> presumption to conclude the truth of all the other: whereupon hee adjudgeth him to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59068:137"/>
Perpetuall banishment to <hi>Lions</hi> in <hi>France</hi>: and thus (thanke <hi>Herodias</hi>) by his looking for a greater dignitie and honour, hee lost that which hee had already.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Herodias, Caesar</hi> would have spared <hi>Herodias</hi> for <hi>Agrippaes</hi> sake as being his sister, but shee refused the curtesie, and chose to suffer the same fortune with her husband; and but very justly neither, for shee had brought him to it. And shee could not in civility refuse to take part with him in his misery, as hee had done with her in her folly, that had caused it; both their estates, dignities and dominions <hi>Caius</hi> bestoweth upon <hi>Agrippa</hi> to their greater vexation; and so wee leave them going to <hi>Lions,</hi> there to thinke, and repent too late, how wholesome the counsell was that was given them by the <hi>Baptist</hi> and that they tooke it not.</p>

The originall and occasion was from <hi>Capito</hi> a gatherer of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute for the Romans in <hi>Iudea.</hi> This man comming into that Office and Countrey a very poor man: and (as no other can be expected from men of so base and meane quality put into so high places) having pilled and polled all before him, to raise and to mend his fortunes; and being now growne rich, and being afraid to bee accused of the Jewes to <hi>Caesar,</hi> for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice and oppression, hee thinkes it the safest way to prevent that, to get some occasion against them, that hee might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse them, and cry theefe first.

despising of his majesty, and contemning his Godhead.

What must the Jewes doe now at such a pinch? Nay, what must <hi>Petronius</hi>? If hee disobey what hee is commanded, hee hazardeth his owne ruine; if hee performe it, hee ruineth a whole Nation: The Jewes will bee ready to dye before they will admit of such an Idol; and <hi>Petronius</hi> is not like to escape, if he bring them not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of it. In this strait between affection to himselfe, and to a whole people, hee useth the best accommodation that the present necessity would afford: namely, not to decline the injunction for his owne safety, but to delay it as much as may bee for the safety of the Jewes: that in the space while the image was leasurely making the one party might possibly bee brought to comply, either the Emperour upon conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to lay his resolution downe, or the Jewes upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion to lay downe their resolutenesse. He appointeth the Image to bee wrought at <hi>Zidon,</hi> whence on the one hand, lesse offence might accrew to the Jews, and on the other some sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction might come to the Emperour, hee hearing by Passengers that the worke was in hand, and they seeing the gentlenesse of <hi>Petronius</hi> that would not worke it in their owne Countrey.</p>
                     <p>Tydings of this lamentable and heavy designe could not bee long kept from the Jewes, nor they upon the tydings long from <hi>Petronius.</hi> To him they come into <hi>Phenicia,</hi> men and women, young and old, of all sorts and conditions an innumerable multitude, with teares in their eyes, and bitter cryes in their mouths, that either hee would surcease the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise that was in hand, or take their lives before they saw the performance of such abomination. <hi>Petronius</hi> threatens, speakes faire, urgeth, perswadeth, but all to no purpose, they tendering their necks rather to the execution, then enduring
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59068:142"/>
to heare of such violation of their Religion. In the end they obtaine this favour of the gentle Governour, that hee will not proceed in this impious worke, till hee or they, or both have sued to <hi>Caesar,</hi> by petition to surcease the design, and to remit of his resolution. And so returne the Jewes to their home and harvest, with some contentment in speeding so well at the present, and in some hope to speed better for the future. <hi>Iosephus</hi> here telleth a story of a miraculous and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine shower that fell as <hi>Petronius</hi> and the Jewes were thus parlying together, whereas there had been no raine of a long time before, and no sign at all of any rain instantly before this fell: God (as hee would have it) seconding this their request with this wonder, and using this argument for the moving of <hi>Petronius</hi> to back theirs.</p>

                     <p>The gentle Governour failed not of his promise, nor of the trust the Jews had reposed in him, but though it may breed his owne smart, hee addresseth a message to the Emperour in their behalfe, and useth the utmost of his perswasive skill and faculty in it. Hee layeth before him that the prosecution of his commanded and intended enterprise, would be the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a whole Nation, the losse of a faire and goodly Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute and Revenue, the impairing of the Roman strength and honour, the prejudice of his Majesties journey into <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which he intended ere long to take: That they were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy grown desperate, and began to neglect their harvest and occasions, whereby a certain famine would follow upon the Land, and a disadvantage to the Countreys round about: with other Arguments of the same nature, sensible, strong, and perswasive, had not the Emperour been wedded to his owne senselesse will, and bewitched and led away with destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive counsell. Two caitives hee had about him, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually suggested evill to him against the Jewes, as if for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eare one, <hi>Helicon</hi> an <hi>Egyptian</hi> mentioned before, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelles</hi>

before <hi>Agrippa</hi> began to mediate: That <hi>Agrippa</hi> comming as at other times to attend the Emperour, was so cast down and daunted at the terror of his lookes, and thunder of his words against the Jewes, that hee fell downe in a swoone, in which hee lay till the next day.

                     <p>The last yeare wee brought <hi>Flaccus</hi> to the Isle of <hi>Andros,</hi> and now let us land him there.

His demeanor in this his banishment; if <hi>Philo</hi> have not set it forth with more Rhetoricke then truth, was full of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and amazednesse: avoiding the society of men, running up and downe the woods, tearing his haire, tormenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and sometimes rising out of his sleepe at midnight, and running abroad, and hee would looke up towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and cry out in a lamentable note. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>The miseries of the <hi>Alexandrian Iewes</hi> could finde no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, while the source from whence they flowed, was not stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, but overflowed them continually. The well-head of this their mischief was double<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The spitefull counsell that was given the Emperor against them by others; and the endlesse rancour that he bare to them himself. To stop the current, and inundation of the calamity that overwhelmed them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from these to puddle springs, they can find no better, or more feasable meanes and way then to send some men of their owne Nation to <hi>Rome,</hi> to atone, intercede &amp; mediate for them. Wee left them upon their journey the last yeare, three in number, as saith <hi>Iosephus,</hi> but five, as <hi>Philo,</hi> who was one of them himselfe: and now let us trace them to <hi>Rome,</hi> and see how they speed.</p>
                     <p>Their first sight of the Emperour was in <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> who saluted them friendly, and promised to give them hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with a great deale of speed, and it was hoped by the most of them with a great deale of favour, but it proved farre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. For he shortly went out of the City down to <hi>Puteoli</hi> by the sea, and they follow him thither. There they first heare the tydings of the state of <hi>Iudea</hi> under <hi>Petronius,</hi> and of <hi>Cesars</hi> Image that was preparing. From <hi>Puteoli</hi> they follow him to <hi>Rome</hi> againe, and there being admitted to audience, hee with a terrible and grinning countenance first asked them; <hi>What? are you that people that of all others scorne my Deity, but had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worship your namelesse God?</hi> and then scornfully lifting his hands up to Heaven, hee named the name <hi>Iehovah.</hi> At this all the company of the malignant party rejoyced, as accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting they had got the day. But when the Iewes began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse and answer for themselves, hee flung away, and fisked
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59068:144"/>
from room to room, they following him all this while: At last, after some chiding at somewhat that hee disliked in the rooms, and appointing how hee would have it mended; hee asked them, <hi>How comes it to passe that you forbeare to eate Swines flesh?</hi> Here the company laughed out againe: and as the Iewes began to answer, hee angerly interposed thus, <hi>I would faine know what are those priviledges of your City, that you chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge</hi>? When they began to speake, hee fisked away into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther roome. Shortly hee commeth to them againe in a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der manner: <hi>And now,</hi> saith hee, <hi>what say you</hi>? And when they began to lay open their matter to him, away flings hee into another roome againe. At last, comming againe more mildly still, <hi>These men seeme to mee,</hi> saith hee, <hi>not so evill, as miserable, which cannot bee perswaded that I am a God</hi>; And so hee bad them to depart. And thus concluded this great scene of expectation, for ought that wee can find further in <hi>Philo.</hi> But whether this was the very end of the matter, or it proceeded further, but that the relation of it is failing in <hi>Philo,</hi> is hard to decide. It seemeth by him that this was the end of their conference with the Tyrant, but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth withall, that they presented him with some <hi>Palino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> or recantation, which is perished and gone. <hi>Eusebius</hi> speaketh of five Bookes written by <hi>Philo,</hi>

                        <hi>Philo</hi> was a Jew by Nation, an Alexandrian by birth: by line, of the kindred of the Priests; and by family, the brother of <hi>Alexander Alabarcha.</hi> His education was in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and that mixed, according to his originall and residence, of the Jewes, and of the Greekes: his proofe was according to his education, versed in the learning of both the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not inferiour to the most learned in either: From this mixture of his knowledge, proceeded the quaintnesse of his stile and writing; explaining Divinity by Philosophy, or rather forcing Philosophy out of Divinity, that hee spoyled the one, and did not much mend the other. Hence his Allegories which did not onely ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>cure the cleare Text, but also much soile the Theologie of succeeding times. His lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is sweet, smooth, and easie, and <hi>Athens</hi> it selfe is not more elegant and <hi>Athenian.</hi> For attaining to the Greeke in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> partly naturally, (that being a Grecian City) and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59068:145"/>
partly by studie, (as not native Grecians used to doe) hee by a mixture of these two together, came to the very <hi>Apex</hi> and perfection of the language, in copiousnesse of words, and in choice. His stile is alwayes fluent, and indeed often to superfluity, dilating his expressions sometimes so copious, that hee is rather prodigall of words, then liberall, and sheweth what hee could say if the cause required, by saying so much, when there is little or no cause at all. And to give him his character for this, in short, Hee is more a Philosopher then a scripture man in heart, and more a Rhetorician then a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher in tongue. His manner of writing is more ingenious then solid, and seemeth rather to draw the subject whereon hee writeth whither his fancy pleaseth, then to follow it whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the nature and inclination of it doth incline. Hence his allegorizing of whatsoever commeth to his hand, and his peremptory confidence in whatsoever hee doth allegorize, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that sometimes hee perswadeth himselfe that hee speaketh mysteries, as <hi>pag.</hi> 89. and sometimes hee chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Scripture, if it speake not as hee would have it, as <hi>page</hi> 100.</p>
                     <p>How too many of the Fathers in the primitive Church fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him in this his veine, it is too well knowne, to the losse of too much time, both in their writing and in our reading. Whether it were because hee was the first that wrote upon the Bible, or rather because hee was the first that wrote in this straine, whose writings came unto their hands, that brought him into credit with Christian Writers, he was so farre fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by too many, that while they would explaine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they did but intricate it, and hazarded to lose the truth of the story, under the cloud of the Allegory. The Jewes have a straine of writing upon the Scripture, that flyeth in a higher region then the writings of Christians, as is apparent to him that shall read their Authors. Now <hi>Philo</hi> being a Jew, and naturally affecting like them to soare in a high place, and being by his education in the Grecian wisdome more Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical then the Iews usually were, and by inclination much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59068:146"/>
with that learning, hee soareth the Jewish pitch with his Grecian wings, and attaineth to a place in which none had flowne in before (unlesse the Therapeutae, of whom here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) writing in a straine that none had used before, and which too many, or at least many too much used after; of his many strange and mysterious matters that hee findeth out in his veine of allegorizing, let the Reader taste but some.</p>

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that his owne Deity might have room enough, hee built this new Temple; and that hee might bee sure to get equall worship with <hi>Iupiter,</hi> hee intended to set up the statue of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter Olympius</hi> there, but pictured directly after his own Image; so that it must have been <hi>Iupiters</hi> statue, but <hi>Caius</hi> his picture; <hi>Iupiters</hi> trunke, but <hi>Caius</hi> his head and face; but this fine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe came to nothing, and was cleane spoiled, for the Ship that went for this statue was spoiled with li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59068:148"/>
and truly it was as fit an <hi>Omen,</hi> as likely could have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented for it. When this invention thus failed him, hee found out a new trick, to get part of the Temple of <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> for himself, and joyned it to the Palace; and hee so contrived the matter, that his entrance was just in the middle betweene those two Gods: and therefore hee called them his <hi>Porters,</hi> and himselfe hee stiled the <hi>Dialis</hi>: and his deare <hi>Caesonia,</hi> and his uncle <hi>Claudius,</hi> and divers of the richer sort hee ordained to bee his Priests, and got a good summe of money of every one of them for their Office; nay hee would bee a Priest unto himself, and which best suited with him in such a function, <hi>he admitted his Horse to bee fellow Priest with him</hi>; and because he would be a right <hi>Iupiter</hi> indeed, he would have his trickes to imitate thunder and lightning, and he would ever bee defying <hi>Iupiter</hi> in <hi>Homers</hi> speech, <hi>Either take me away, or I will take thee.</hi> And thus was his Palace parted into a senselesse contrariety, one part to bee a Temple, and another part a common Stewes; in one, <hi>Caius</hi> to be adored as a God, in another, <hi>Caius</hi> to play the Beast, deflowring Virgins, violating Boyes, adulterating Matrons, exacting and extracting money from all; and using to tumble himselfe in heapes of Money which he had so gotten.</p>

that hee caused many of the petitioners to bee slaine, hastning his owne death by theirs, and condemning himselfe by their condemnation. For what now remaines thought the conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators but a speedy course, when neither his owne reason, nor their petitions, nor their countreys custome can any whit move him to goodnesse, nor divert him from his cruelties? Besides this generall quarrell of their countrey, some of them had their peculiar heart-burnings against him for particular abuses: As <hi>Minutianus</hi> for the death of his friend <hi>Lepidus</hi> and for feare of his owne life: but <hi>Cassius Chereas</hi> for divers affronts and disgraces, which the Tyrant not onely used but loved to put upon him above other men. He was Tribune of the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian band, or as it were Captaine of the guard, and a man as valiant, as that place required or any whatsoever. Yet was it the senselesse and inconsiderate tyrants delight and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall custome, to geere him with the taunts of cowardise or effeminacy. Whensoever hee came to him to aske of him a word or ticket for the Watch, hee would give him <hi>Venus</hi> or <hi>Priapus</hi>: when hee offered him his hand to kisse, hee would frame it into an obscene forme, and so hold it to him: And that which might make him odious to others, hee caused him to bee the wracker and tormentor of delinquents, himself standing by, that hee might use no mercy for feare; and yet when hee had cruelly and miserably torne and rent the poore wretches, would the spitefull Prince speake pittifully to them, bemoane the extremity, condole their condition, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times give them rewards, thus turning the detestation of all the cruelty upon the head of <hi>Chereas</hi> onely: such things as these set the abused man all of a fire for revenge, that was hot enough already for the common cause, and hee wanteth nothing to end his own disgrace and his countries misery, but partners and opportunity. He therefore first assaieth <hi>Clemens</hi> the chiefe commander of the souldiery, &amp; <hi>Papinius</hi> the chiefe Quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Squire of the Emperours body, with feeling words and forcible arguments to draw them into the same designe with himselfe of freeing the Common wealth from the common

Hee therefore speedily addresseth himselfe to <hi>Sabinus,</hi> and to <hi>Minutianus,</hi> though a kinsman to <hi>Caius,</hi> and prevaileth with them both, to bee of the same mind and action with him: and all of them having men ready for this exploit doe but waite for an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to bring it to effect.</p>

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59068:152"/>
on, in which they might have better accesse in a mixed crowd and multitude.</p>
                     <p>This time was come, and three daies of the festivall, and of the shewes were past before opportunitie would serve their turne: On the fourth and last of the solemnity which must be the day or none, and this was <hi>the ninth of the Calends of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> or <hi>Ianuary</hi> the three and twenty, <hi>Chereas</hi> provideth his confederates for the expedition both for mettle and weapons. In the morning betime, people of all conditions flocke to the place of the shewes and solemnity to get them places, dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of themselves where they could, so that men and women, bond and free, noble and base sate mixedly together, and happy was hee that could get a place no matter where. At last comes <hi>Caius,</hi> way forced for him through the crowd, all eyes upon him, but theirs especially that meant him mischiefe. His first beginning of that dayes solemnity was with sacrifice, with the blood whereof when the cloaths of <hi>Asprenas</hi> a Senator were accidentally bedawbed, it afforded matter of laughter to the Emperour, but it proved a fatall omen to himselfe. After his sacrifice hee tooke his place with the Nobles about him, and the plaies began: one of them was a Mimick acting that part which <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> did at the slaughter of King <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus:</hi> Another, of one or more actors that seemed to vomit blood, so that the stage was even bloody over; and his sports read his destiny, himselfe being presently to substantiate in his owne person, what these did but personate and represent of others. Having fitten a spectator of these his owne <hi>Omens</hi> till towards one a clock, and indifferent whether to goe to dinner or no, his stomack being undisposed through his ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdayes gluttony, <hi>Asprenas</hi> a partner in the plot, sitting neer him perswaded him for his refreshment to goe to the bath, and so to dinner, and then to the playes and showes againe. <hi>Caius</hi> giving notice of his rising, the company bussles to make him roome, the conspirators pretending officiousnesse, helpt to keepe off the crowde and people; when hee was come from among the multitude, hee tooke not the open and ordinary

way to the Palace, but a back and by way toward the Bath: There was he met and accoasted by <hi>Chereas,</hi> who came to him as the custome was to demand the word: which when hee gave him with his accustomed scorne, and disgracefulnesse, <hi>Chereas</hi> drew and flew upon him, with these words, <hi>Hoc age,</hi> and smote him sore into the coller bone: upon the wound <hi>Caesar</hi> neither cried out nor resisted, but sought to have slipt away.

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59068:153"/>
corpse of the slaine tyrant hee was made a corpse himselfe: When the rumour of what had passed came into the Treater, it moved different passions according to their different affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Some could not beleeve the newes it was so good, others would not, because it was displeasing, hoping better, then that they had lost so great a patron of their unrulinesse and sporting. But when the Souldiers came in thither after the rumour, with the heads of <hi>Asprenas, Norbanus</hi> and <hi>Auteius</hi> in their hands, then imagine what case they were all in there, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to be all involved in the same fatall end, by the same fatall fury, though they were not of the same opinion and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the fact that had lately passed. But this feare and fury was with as much speed as wit, and indeed were both finely calmed and removed by one <hi>Aruntius,</hi> for comming in among them in a mourning weed, as if for <hi>Caius,</hi> hee plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and dolefully, and assuredly averred that hee was dead. One would have thought that this should have increased the raging of the Souldiers farre more then before, but it had the cleane contrary effect, as his policy had wittily foreseene. For when they knew certainly that hee was dead, of whom they expected a reward for this their outrage in his quarrell, and when they considered what the people might doe now he was dead, who so hated him while hee was alive, they sheathed their swords and their fury together, and withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Theater, and the peoples feare from the people fairely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and quietly both at once. By a carriage of as much valour as this was of ingenuitie, did <hi>Valerius Asiaticus</hi> calme the tumult of the people in the market place, for when there was no other language, but, <hi>who is it, and who is it that hath killed Caesar?</hi> hee steppeth into some place above the people, and boldly cried <hi>I would it had been I,</hi> and with his boldnesse daunted the mutiny, and amazed their anger.</p>

death of the Prince, but their minds not so well about the manner of the future government. The Senate being assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the Capitoll were divided about this great matter, whether the commonwealth should returne to its old Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, or to its later Monarchy againe; some remembring the tyrannies used by the two latter monarchs, abhorred the thought of that government any longer: Others considering that it were better to bee under one tyrant, then under many, were as much against democracy; and yet if they might have a Monarch, which they desired, they were yet to seeke who should be he. <hi>Sentius</hi> the Consull was vehement for the former choyce, and might have well been suspected for affecting some kind of monarchy for the present himselfe, for hee was chief governour alone, but that his earnestnesse to reduce the state to its former rule stopped the mouth of any such prejudice. Thus rose the Court without any determination, and no lesse was the Citie divided in opinion.

For being drawne out and brought into the light, and his face knowne by him and who hee was, hee presently shewes him all reverence and homage, and cryeth out <hi>An Emperour, an Emperour</hi>; with this cry they bring him out to some more of their fellowes, who getting him on their shoulders bring him into their Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There hee lodged that night, and you may suppose that hee slept out little, being so divided betwixt hope and feare. The Consull and Senate the next day hearing what was done, send to him to advise him to submit to their government, and not to disturbe the State with a monarchy againe, which had been so burdensome and tedious to it so long: which if hee should goe about to doe they would oppose him to their utmost strength, and doubted not the assistance of the Gods in this their vindication of their liberty. <hi>Verrannius</hi> and <hi>Brachus,</hi> their two Legats upon this message, delivered their errand with as much moving Rhetorick and intreaty as they could invent, beseeching him with all the vehemency they could, not to distemper the Republike againe by affecting and aspiring the Monarchy, which was now in a hopefull possibility of setling her tranquillitie and libertie to her owne content. But the sight of the strength and forwardnesse of the Souldiers that were about him, made them to straine their Oratory one key higher then it may bee they had either commission for at their comming forth, or any thankes for at their returne. For they besought him that if hee would needs have the Empire, that hee would rather receive it from the hands of the Senate then of the Souldiers, and make an entry to his government by consent and approvall and not by violence.</p>

                     <p>That rule and Monarchy that the Souldiers would have tumbled upon <hi>Claudius</hi> they cared not how, <hi>Agrippa</hi> the King of whom wee had mention a good while agoe folded it as it were upon him fairely and smoothly, that it both lay more easie for him himselfe, and lesse wrinckled and rugged to the eyes of others. For first comming privately to <hi>Claudius</hi> whilst hee somewhat fluctuated in opinion, and was ready to have yeelded to the Senates propositions, he setled him in a contrary resolution, perswading him by no meanes to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake or relinquish that faire apprehension and seisure of the dominion that was offered him. Then commeth hee as craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily into the Senate as if hee had been a meer stranger to what was in hand, and there asketh how the matter went between them and <hi>Claudius</hi>; when they ingenuously laid all the businesse before him, and demanded his counsell and advise in those affaires: Hee subtle enough for his owne ends, and neither regarding their libertie, nor <hi>Claudius</hi> his Monarchy so much in the matter as his owne securitie in his kingdome, maketh faire weather to them, and professeth with all solemnitie to serve them in their designes to the utmost of his power. But when it came to the vote what must bee done, and the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was that they must take up armes, and arme their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and compasse that with the sword that they could not doe with perswasions; then <hi>Agrippa</hi> thought it was time to worke or never. Hee therefore puts them in mind of the strength of the Souldiers that had proclaimed <hi>Claudius,</hi> and of their forces but weake, few, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unexpert: that to hazzard a warre was to hazard their State, and therefore hee would advise them to tender to <hi>Claudius</hi> propositions of accommodation, and if they were so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, hee himselfe would bee the agent. It is agreed upon, and hee sent upon this imployment, which how hee would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it is easie to guesse, by looking upon his owne condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59068:155"/>
in which hee now stood. For in the life of <hi>Caius</hi> it was conceived that his evill counsell had very much forwarded the others crueltie and mischievousnesse, and therefore if the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate bee masters of their desires, hee can little expect to bee master any more of his Kingdome, but if with all his offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and trotting up and downe hee can helpe <hi>Claudius</hi> to the Monarchy, hee is sure hee hath then holpen himselfe to the royalty. It was therefore not an oversight in that grave &amp; discreet great Councell that they imployed such a man as this in their occasions, who, a farre dimmercie of judgement then any of theirs would easily perceive, would bee against them: but it was their descreet evasion with their honour, when fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themselves too weake to deale it out by force of Armes, they came to a noble reference, by the motion and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of so great a Prince. When <hi>Agrippa</hi> commeth to <hi>Claudius</hi> hee is now more urgent then before, that hee stand to his challenge, because he had now groped the mind and strength of the Senate: and hee prevaileth with him so farre that the Souldiers goe to the Senate house, and there demand a confirmation of their choice. It was now come to it in the Councell, that they were resolved to choose one Monarch, for they saw the Souldiers would so have it, but now the question was who that must bee; some were for one, some for another, but the conspirators against <hi>Caius</hi> were against <hi>Claudius</hi> howsoever: This division had like to have caused ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tumult, but the end of all was, that the power and feare of the Souldiers prevailed, and the Senate was glad to accept him for their Prince whom they durst not refuse.</p>

But <hi>Sabinus,</hi> foolehardy as hee was, when <hi>Claudius</hi> had granted him his pardon, and not onely so but also restored him to his former honours, hee disdaining to bee singled from his fellow conspirators in their end any more then in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, fell upon his owne sword and died.

This <hi>Claudius</hi> was the sonne of <hi>Drusus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Livia,</hi> a man dull and diseased even from his childhood, and for that brought up most in the converse with women or nurses: hence his effeminacy and luxuriousnesse at all times, and his readinesse to be led away by the counsell of women at some. Hee was now about fiftie yeers of age when he began to reigne, at the very ripenesse of all the discretion he had, but that it was often blasted with feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, drunkennes &amp; wicked counsell. When he was set quietly in the Throne, the first thing hee did was to get the two dayes in which the agitation was about the change of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, quite out of memory, and for that end hee made an act of oblivion of all things that had passed either in words or actions of all that time: yet had hee not wrought his owne securitie so farre, but that hee caused all that came neere him to bee searched for weapons, and while hee sate at any meale, hee had a strong guard about him. For the motion that had beene so lately and so strongly carried for the abolition of monarchy, and the other which proposed others thereto when Monarchy was agreed upon, and would have excluded him, had taken such an impression upon him, that

hyssop for sauce, and water for drinke: there is generall si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence all the meale, save that one or other asketh or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveth questions, the rest holding their peace; and they shew by their severall gestures that they understand, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove or doubt.

For whereas before the displeasure of the Emperour lay so heavy upon them that they neither could nor durst stand out in their owne defence, when that burden is now removed they gather heart and mettall, and now though the Greeks and they be continually at daggers drawn, yet now it is upon equall tearmes, and they dare strike as well as the other. But in <hi>Babylonia</hi> and thereabouts, their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries is but now a brewing, and an equall strait is preparing for them, as had been to either of the other, though it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with some smiling of a seeming happinesse, and the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine of present prosperitie. The bloodhound of vengeance was to hunt this nation, and not to bee taken off till it was destroyed: and therefore when it giveth off the quest in one place, it takes it in another, and leaveth not their footing till it had left them no footing at all.</p>
                     <p>Those Jewes whose Tragedy wee have seene acted already found their owne misery though they sought it not, and how much more shall they that wee are now to bring upon the scene that sought and wooed it with their utmost paines.</p>

They therefore getting away all the Armes their masters house would afford, betake themselves to a strong place in an Iland of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and there publish and proclaime their rebellious resolution.

And thus continued these bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in pompe and height for 15. yeers together: till a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of <hi>Anilaeus</hi> began to cloud and eclipse their prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: For <hi>Anilaeus</hi> having slaine a <hi>Parthian</hi> Peere that he might enjoy his Lady, and shee when shee was now his wife, using her ancient idolatry as in her first husbands dayes, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a double offence to his chiefest friends, namely, for that hee had married an heathen, and for that shee continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed still in her Idolatry: They seriously admonish <hi>Anilaeus</hi> of the matter, but hee slew one of the chiefest of them for his home-reproofe and admonition. Therefore the rest addresse themselves to <hi>Asinaeus,</hi> and demand the vindication of their native Laws and Religion: hee rebuketh his brother <hi>Anilaeus,</hi> and is therefore poisoned by the <hi>Parthian</hi> Lady, because that her husband might bee from under rebuke, and might bee commander of all. He being now so indeed, first invadeth the country of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> son in Law to <hi>Artabanus,</hi> and forrageth that, and by a surpizall getteth <hi>Mithridates</hi> prisoner, yet sendeth him home again to his own possessions, having hardly delivered him from his souldiers fury that they did not kill him: <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> sensible of the disgrace of his usage (for they had set him naked upon an Asse,) and instigated by the haughty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull spirit of his wife, raiseth what force he can get, and giveth <hi>Anilaeus</hi> battell and routeth him. But <hi>Anilaeus</hi> himselfe escaping, and recruting an army of dissolute and resolute fellowes againe, hee beginneth to spoile some townes of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> but the <hi>Babylonians</hi> finding a fit opportunitie, fall upon <hi>Anilaeus</hi> and his troope, and slew many of them, and <hi>Anilaeus</hi> himselfe among the rest: This bridle and curbe of the Jewes, which had laine so long and so heavy upon the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> being now taken off, they begin now to rise up and to curbe and oppresse the Jewes: who for their safety flee to <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi>: and there they reside quietly for the space of five yeers, but

                        <p>This yeare the Romanists have brought <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and made this the first yeare or beginning of his Episcopacy there. For thus <hi>Baronius, That Peter came to Rome this second yeare of Claudius the Emperour, it is the common Opinion of all men.</hi> And to this purpose he alledgeth <hi>Eusebius</hi> his Chronicle, and <hi>Ierome de scriptoribus Ecclesiasticis,</hi> and concludeth that <hi>others have written the same things concerning the time, that there can bee no doubt left of it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It may be tolerated to insist a little the more largely upon the examination of this opinion, not for that it is of any such great import in its owne nature, as for that it is made of so great by them for their owne advantage. For were it gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that <hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that he went thither in this yeare, yet what great matter were there in this, in common sense and reason? But because unreasonable men have from hence, or upon this foundation built the suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Pope, the great delusion of the world, let the same common sense and reason equally and impartially judge of the probability or improbability of this thing, in these two parts into which this <hi>tenet</hi> doth fall of it self.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Whether it be probable that <hi>Peter</hi> was Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> at all.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Whether it bee possible that hee could come thither this yeare according as they themselves have laid his progresse,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59068:164"/>
and that hee should set up an Episcopacy there.</p>
                        <p>Weigh the first by these;</p>
                        <p>First, <hi>Peter</hi> was Minister of the Circumcision, why then should hee goe settle himselfe to live and dye among the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcised? Hee might indeed have preached to the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised as hee travailed up and downe, as <hi>Paul</hi> did to the circumcised, being the Minister of the uncircumcision, but to take up his abode and residence, and thereto settle, to live and die among them; was a thing neither probable in the eyes of other men, nor justifiable in him himself.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, if <hi>Peter</hi> were at <hi>Rome</hi> in the sense and extent that the Romanists will have it, then hath the Scripture omitted one of the greatest points of salvation that belongeth to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity: For how many maine points of faith hath Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry drawne out of this one conclusion, <hi>that Peter was Bishop of Rome</hi>; as the Primacy of the Pope, the infallibility of his Chaire, his absolute power of binding and loosing, no sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation out of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and divers other things, which all hang upon the Pin forenamed: And it is utterly incredible; 1. That the holy Ghost that wrote the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for mans salvation, should not expresse or mention a thing that containeth so many points of salvation. 2. That <hi>Luke</hi> that undertooke to write the Acts of the Apostles, should omit this one act of <hi>Peter,</hi> which is made of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence then all the actions of all the Apostles beside. It is above all beleef, that he that would tell of <hi>Philips</hi> being at <hi>Az<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and going to <hi>Caesarea,</hi> chap. 8.40. <hi>Sauls</hi> going to <hi>Tarsus,</hi> ch. 9.30. And <hi>Barnabas</hi> his going thither to him, and divers other things of smal import, in comparison, should omit the greatest &amp; most matteriall, &amp; of the infinitest import that ever mortall mans journey was (for to that height is the journey of <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> now come) if there had ever been such a thing at all.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, it is as incredible, that <hi>Paul</hi> sending salutation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> to so many in <hi>Rome,</hi> and againe from so many there, should omit to have named <hi>Peter</hi> at one time or other if hee had been there. What was become of <hi>Peter</hi> in these reciprocall kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:59068:165"/>
and salutations of the Saints one to another; was hee a sleep, or was hee sullen, or what shall we make of him, or was hee not indeed at <hi>Rome</hi> at all?</p>
                        <p>But not to insist upon this question whether <hi>Peter</hi> were at <hi>Rome</hi> at all, which hath been proved negatively by many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and by many undeniable Arguments; let us looke a little upon this foundation of his being there, which hath been laid, namely, his comming thither this year, which is the second thing to be taken into consideration.</p>
                        <p>And about this point, there have been divers simple <hi>Ignora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musses</hi> in former time, who so they held this first Article of the Roman Creed, <hi>That Peter was Bishop of Rome five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, and dyed in the last year of Nero,</hi> and so beleeved as the Church beleeved, they never cared to bring the head and heels together, or to observe how the times agreed, but have easily swallowed this camell of senselesse computation, <hi>that Peter went from the Councell of Ierusalem,</hi> Acts 15. <hi>to Rome, and there sate Bishop five and twenty yeares, which expired in the last of Nero</hi>; whereas, betwixt the Councell at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the last of <hi>Nero</hi> there were but twenty yeares in all, if there were so many: But nimbler wits, that cannot bee caught in so plaine and apparent a trap as this, have found out a quainter and more curious date from which to begin the Chaire of <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> then this, and that is from the Story in the twelfth of the <hi>Acts of the Apostles.</hi> Where <hi>Peter</hi> being apprehended by <hi>Herod</hi> after his murder of <hi>Iames</hi> the great, and being delivered by an Angel, and having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Disciples with his delivery, they being together in <hi>Iohn Markes</hi> house, hee is said, <hi>to depart to another place</hi>: which they say, (and you must beleeve it, or they will take it very ill) was to <hi>Rome,</hi> and this was (say they) the second year of <hi>Claudius.</hi> A long journey beleeve it, to run to <hi>Rome,</hi> to avoid danger at <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: and <hi>Rome</hi> but a mad place to set up an Episcopacy in at this time, as hath been plaine in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, and will bee also in the subsequent story of it. But that we may see, if not the impossibility, yet the utter improbability
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59068:165"/>
of that his journey in this second of <hi>Claudius,</hi> if that were the journey in the twelfth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> it will not bee impertinent to insert a story out of <hi>Iosephus</hi> concerning <hi>Agrippaes</hi> returne from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where hee slew <hi>Iames,</hi> and imprisoned <hi>Peter.</hi>

of <hi>Herod</hi> King of <hi>Chalcis,</hi> hee sendeth forth an Edict into <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Alexandria</hi> in behalfe and favour of the Jewes.

And hee, as it befitted a man that had had happy successe, returned with speed. And comming to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> hee performed or offered Thankes-Offerings, omitting nothing that was injoyned by the Law: Wherefore hee caused many Nazarites to bee shaven; and the golden Chaine which was given him by <hi>Caius,</hi> weighing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually with the iron chaine that had bound his royall hands, hee hung up <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <pb n="311" facs="tcp:59068:166"/>Now let the Reader observe in either story one speciall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of time, as in <hi>Iosephus,</hi> That <hi>Claudius was now se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time Consul:</hi> and in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> that <hi>Iames</hi> was slaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Easter</hi>; and then let him cast whether it were possible, at the least probable, that so many things should bee done and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede betweene the beginning of January, when <hi>Claudius</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered his Consulship, and Easter, as in these Stories must inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, if <hi>Peter</hi> were imprisoned at the Easter of this yeare; yea though it fell the latest or furthest in the yeare that ever Easter yet fell. For, for <hi>Claudius</hi> to make his decree, and disperse it: for <hi>Agrippa</hi> to provide for his journey, and part from his friends in <hi>Rome:</hi> for him to travaile from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> to performe his Sacrifices and Ceremonies there, to seeke to lay hold upon certaine of the Church, to light upon <hi>Iames,</hi> and to kill him, and then to apprehend and Imprison <hi>Peter,</hi> and all this betwixt <hi>Claudius</hi> his entry of his Consulship in Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, and Easter, is a thing so incredible (especially to him that considereth how slowly great bodies move, as Kings and Emperours in their actions) as that it seemeth next impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For it cannot bee imagined that this decree for the Jews was the first thing that <hi>Claudius</hi> did after hee was made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sull, or that hee fell upon that worke in the very beginning of <hi>Ianuary</hi>; for matters of the City and of <hi>Italy</hi> one would think should take up the first thoughts of the Consuls, when they entred into that Office, and not of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Alexandria,</hi> so many hundred of miles distant: and matters of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans themselves, and not of the Jewes a despised Nation: But grant that on the very first day hee set pen to paper for that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, on the second disperst it, and on the third dismissed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grippa,</hi> yet must so great a Prince have some preparation for so great a journey, hee must have some time to part with so great acquaintance; it was strange if hee waited not some time for a convenient wind, and hee must take up some reasonable time after hee is shipped, before hee land in <hi>Iudea.</hi> After his land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some time was required for such a King in his owne King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to prepare for his journey by Land to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> some
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59068:167"/>
for his setling there; some for his Sacrifices, and performance of the Rites of the Law mentioned; and all these before the apprehension of <hi>Iames,</hi> and that no man knowes how long before Easter. Let indifferency judge, whether all these things were possible to bee done in that space of time; and then let it censure of the matter in hand.</p>
                     <p>To the eviction of this opinion, that <hi>Peter</hi> went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there began his Episcopacy the second yeare of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> Romanists themselves may bee produced that doe gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say it; as <hi>Salmeron</hi> on the twelfth of the Acts, who holds that hee went thither in <hi>Claudius</hi> his fourth, and hee produceth <hi>Comestor, Nuaclerus,</hi> and <hi>Petrus de natalibus</hi> of the same opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him.</p>
                     <p>So likewise <hi>Simeon</hi> the <hi>Metaphrast,</hi> though hee bring <hi>Peter</hi> from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> this yeare for feare of <hi>Herod,</hi> and lead him through many places ordaining Churches and making Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, yet in conclusion hee mentioneth not one word of <hi>Rome,</hi> but bringeth him to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> again at Passeover next. Hereupon <hi>Surius,</hi> or at least his Marginist, &amp; <hi>Baronius</hi> are ready to give him the lie; and though they both alledge him, and applaud him while he serveth their own humour, yet here they fly in his face, and tell him he is beside the cushion, because hee is beside their opinion, and saith not what they would have him say.</p>
                     <p>Upon consideration of what hath been said before, we have put over the death of <hi>Iames</hi> to the yeare next following, as not seeing it possible to have fallen out this yeare before Easter, all circumstances being well considered: and accordingly have we referred thither, as the order requireth, the imprisonment of <hi>Peter,</hi> and his fleeing for his life, or retiring for some other cause, which the Romanists will have to have bin to <hi>Rome</hi>; and there will we take it into some examination again.</p>

And then let him judge how senselesse a thing it is to speake of delivering unwritten Traditions to the Church, when almost all the New Testament was yet to bee written. Or take it at the Councell at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was divers yeares hence, when all the Apostles were all together, and giving rules to the Church, or take it at <hi>Pauls</hi> apprehension at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> when imagine all the Apostles to bee together againe, and even even at either of those times, will the same absurdity follow still for no more of the New Testament was written, or very little more then now. And then how ridiculous doth it appeare, That the Apostles
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59068:172"/>
should offer to give rules to the Church by unwritten traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they had all their Epistles for rules of the Church yet to write: If they would leave the Church to bee regulated by unwritten traditions, why should they write after? And if they would have her regulated by their writings, why should they give her unwritten traditions before? A quick wit will nimbly answer, that they left her such traditions as were not to bee expressed in their writings, but let an honest conscience and an unprejudicate judgement censure whether this will abide the test, yea or no. For is it within any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of likelihood that these Apostles did know what things <hi>Paul</hi> would not write of in his Epistles, that they should deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver such things before-hand for tradition, when as yet they hardly knew whether hee was to be an Apostle of the Gentiles or no, when they did not know whether he would write any Epistles or no, much lesse did they know what Epistles he would write? <hi>Appello conscientiam,</hi> and so much for traditions.</p>

                           </note> There is yet a third opinion as much unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable as either of these; That the Disciples concluded that an Angell by this knocking and voyce came to give them notice of <hi>Peters</hi> death to bee neer at hand, and that therefore they call him his Angell, and that it was sometimes so used that one Saint should know of anothers death by such revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:59068:173"/>
The Jewes indeed in their writings make frequent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Samael</hi> the Angell of death, but they call him so for inflicting it, and not for foretelling it: And wee have some examples indeed in the Ecclesiasticall history of one man knowing of anothers death by such revelations and appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as these: but because those stories are very dubitable in themselves, and that the Scripture is utterly without any such precedent, this interpretation is but utterly groundlesse and unwarrantable. The most proper and most easie meaning therefore of those words of the Disciples, <hi>It is his Angel,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to bee, that they tooke it for some Angell that had assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Peters</hi> shape or stood at the gate in his resemblance.</p>

                     <p>The place whither hee went is not to bee knowne, because not revealed by Scripture.

I should as soone nominate <hi>Antioch</hi> for the place whither hee went at this time, as any other place at a far distance: For I cannot imagine any time when hee and <hi>Paul</hi> should meet at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> reprove him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11. so likely as this time: for it is most probable that <hi>Peter</hi> being put to flee for his life, would get out of the territories of <hi>Herod</hi> for his safetie: now there was no place more likely for his safetie then in <hi>Antioch,</hi> where not onely the distance of place might preserve him, but the new borne Church would seeke to secure him.</p>
