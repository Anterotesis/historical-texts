            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Shall not wonder if thou be at a loss, what to impute this my so sudden appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in publick again upon the same Subject, for I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, I my self am in some sort at a loss what to impute it to. Whether to the excess of my zeal in a cause of so great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, or to my impatience to be freed from these Polemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Engagements, which are not so suitable to my Genius. But so far as I know my own meaning it is both. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having since my last by
<pb facs="tcp:38541:3"/>
further converse with either books or men, discovered, as I conceive, the utmost that can be said touching the point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Me and my Antagonist, for the more timely assisting so weighty a truth, and for the freeing my self from any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture trouble, I have here afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand obviated whatever I can suspect he may return as materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, in answer to my Reply. This it may be, may save us both any further labour, at least it will my self. For I profess my self to have neither hope nor ability of satisfying others by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidences, than by which I find my self so fully and clearly satisfied.</p>
            <p>That I have vindicated some
<pb facs="tcp:38541:3"/>
uses in our own Church from all suspicions of Idolatry, is but what I owe to her, as a professed member of her body, and to the honour and memory of our pious and judicious Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers. That I have annexed some few Monitions touching <hi>spiritual</hi> Idolatry, is for the rescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my self also from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of an over Bigotical zeal against the <hi>external</hi> or <hi>ritual.</hi> For I am abundantly aware how little the avoyding the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> or <hi>ritual</hi> Idolatry will avail to salvation unless we also seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously endeavour to purify our selves from the <hi>inward</hi> or <hi>spiritual,</hi> without which purity no man shall see God. But in pretence of cleansing our selves from
<pb facs="tcp:38541:4"/>
the <hi>inward,</hi> to make nothing of the <hi>outward,</hi> is the fruit of that false spirit that appeared in the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> of old, and has expresly showed it self in these latter times, amongst some high flown <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> who have had the boldness to declare that there is no such thing as <hi>external</hi> Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. Which is spoken with as much soundness of truth, as if they should declare, That there is no such thing neither as <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Murder, Adultery, Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and Blasphemie. But our blessed Saviour, that infallible example of life, has taught us a better lesson of fulfilling all righteousness. And they that will be externally wicked, what have they but their own vain
<pb facs="tcp:38541:4"/>
boast to witness their integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? That God would deliver thee and my self and all men, from all manner of Hypocrisie, that we may injoy God in the simplicity of Heart and a good Conscience, to our present and everlasting comfort, is the earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est desire of</p>

                  <hi>I.</hi> A brief account of his proceeding in his Antidote against Idolatry.</head>
               <p>I Have already, in my <hi>Antidote against Idolatry,</hi> with sufficient useful evidence and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty discovered what is and ought to be held to be idolatry amongst Christians; but in such a way, that I only exhibited several cases or instances of Idolatry, and proved them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, rather by Testimony either Divine, or the common suffrage of men, I mean such as are Christians, than from the intrinsick general No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Idolatry, not at all intended to be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in that Treatise; that method I then took, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sufficient for the use and purpose then aimed at, which was to convince the World by plain and obvious Arguments, what things professed and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38541:6"/>
practised in the Roman Church might justly be esteemed Idolatrous.</p>

                  <hi>II.</hi> The definition of Idolatry with the useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness thereof.</head>
               <p>But now for the greater satisfaction of the more curious and Philosophical Genius, out of those several instances in the abovesaid Treatise, I shall draw one common Notion or Definition, both true and adaequate, which will be a certain measure whereby we may expeditely understand whatever is truly Idolatry, and what not. For, it is plain, that to whatsoever the Definition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, the thing defined belongs to the same, and to whatsoever the Definition does not belong, the thing defined cannot belong to it. Of so great importance is it therefore to propose a true and adaequate Definition of Idolatry. Which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is this; <hi>Cultus superstitiosus quo peculiaritates Divinae violantur.</hi> Idolatry is a kind of supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious worship, whereby the peculiarities of the Godhead are violated. There is no kind nor act of Idolatry which will not fall under this general Notion, nor any kind or act of <hi>Ritual</hi> worship that falls under it, that is not Idolatry, as will more plainly appear after our explication thereof.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="part">
               <head>
                  <hi>III.</hi> The explication of the Definition.</head>
               <p>As for the Term defined, <hi>Idolatry,</hi> there is no man so unskilfull, (though according to the Notation of the word, it signifies properly the worship of an Image or Idol,) as to think that to be the adaequate sense of Idolatry, since they that worship the Sun are acknowledged to be Idolaters,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38541:6"/>
though they worship him without an Image; And therefore that scruple passed over, nothing hinders but that the Notion of Idolatry may be as large, as the proposed Definition, which is, <hi>superstitious worship whereby the peculiarities of the Godhead are violated.</hi> I add <hi>superstitious</hi> to <hi>worship,</hi> that the <hi>Genus</hi> may be the more <hi>immediate</hi>; and by <hi>supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi> I understand <hi>pseudoreligious,</hi> if I may so speak, that is false, or depraved religious worship: And I name <hi>no object,</hi> because I would not restrain it to any one kind of object, but be the pretence of worshipping God, Saints, Angels, or what ever object else, when it is in such a way, as that the Divine peculiarities are violated, that is Idolatry according to this Definition. Superstitious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship therefore is the <hi>Genus</hi> of the Definition, what remains, the <hi>difference,</hi> viz <hi>whereby the peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Godhead are violated.</hi> I am fain to make use of this more general and abstract term, <hi>peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arities,</hi> that it may comprehend whatever things are peculiar to God, whether his <hi>Attributes</hi> or <hi>Rites</hi> chosen and appropriate to his own worship, which his own <hi>choice</hi> is enough to make peculiar to him, though closely look't into, they may have also a <hi>natural</hi> significancy of those excellencies that are proper to the Godhead. Such are the having a Temple and a Symbolical presence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for invocation and worship, praying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Symbolical presence, having incense burnt before it, and Lamps or Candles light up, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These and the like were the modes that God made choice of, to signify the honour and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38541:7"/>
worship due to himself, and therefore to use them to any else, is a violation of his peculiarities. For by the <hi>violation of the peculiarities of the Godhead,</hi> I understand any kind of prophanation or vilification of them, either by obscuring or lessening of them in himself, or else by communicating of them to others. As to set up such a Symbolical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to be worshipped towards, as pretends to <hi>represent</hi> God, who is <hi>irrepresentable,</hi> as being infinite in Majesty and Greatness, this were to lessen, obscure, or indeed to abolish the infinite glorious Majesty of God, which is peculiar to him, and so to make an Idol of him, and therefore were gross Idolatry. But to erect a Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal presence to a Creature, that is Idolatry upon the other score, it implying Omnipresence or Omnipercipience to be in that Creature.</p>

                  <hi>IV.</hi> What a Symbolical presence is.</head>
               <p>For, a Symbolical presence is nothing else but <hi>some figure or imagerie, instituted or erected for the invoking of supplicating, or any way religiously worshipping that invisible Power or Spirit for whom it is erected or made.</hi> So that in brief, all Idolatry is such as either turns God into an Idol, or turns an Idol, that is, the Creature we give religious worship to, in some respect, into a God, in give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it something which is peculiar unto him.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>V.</hi> That that religious worship of Daemons which was truly Idolatry, was really Divine.</head>
               <p>Whence for the utter taking away all litigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness about terms, That <hi>religious</hi> worship which misapplyed or given to any Creature constitutes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38541:7"/>
Idolatry, may rightly and truly be also called <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>; and is so, if it make the act Idolatry: for that implyes that it violates some <hi>peculiarity</hi> of the Godhead, and attributes it to the Creature, which is, as to that respect, to make a God of it. And such Divine worship as this was, that which the Heathens gave to their Daemons, though they took it to be only religious, and such as did not appertain peculiarly to God himself; as is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly observable in the <hi>Platonists,</hi> whom yet neither St. <hi>Austin,</hi> nor any other serious Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an will stick to conclude to have been Idolaters in their Daemon-worship. And therefore, if we will but use <hi>just weights</hi> and <hi>measures,</hi> whatever Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians do the like things to Saints and Angels, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it is not <hi>Divine</hi> worship, but an inferiour <hi>religious</hi> worship, they must be also judged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Idolatry.</p>

But laying aside all these more exteriour and obvious Arguments, we will deal now more precisely and Philosophically, and argue only from the most intrinsecal and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial <hi>Topick</hi> in all <hi>Logick,</hi> and examine the Roman Idolatries by the inmost Notion and Definition of the Thing, shewing that even that which seems to be only by Divine Declaration Idolatry, is also, if more rationally considered, Idolatry according to the proposed Definition.</p>

                  <hi>VII.</hi> That the forbidding to worship God by an Image, is the natural sense of the second Commandement.</head>
               <p>As the worshipping God by an Image, is plainly declared Idolatry by God himself in the second Commandement, <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy self any graven Image,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou shalt not bow down to it, nor worship it,</hi> &amp;c. The bowing down to and worshipping a graven Image, though in pretence to worship God thereby, is plainly prohibited by this Commandement. For the prohibition of worshipping any other God, is sufficiently evident in the first Commandement, <hi>Thou shalt have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods but me.</hi> Whereby he pronounces that he alone will be worshipped: whence it naturally follows, that this next precept is at least chiefly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the purity and congruity of his own worship, forbidding to worship him by any Image, in bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, or worshiping it, though in reference to himself. This is the most natural, and indeed the necessary sense of this precept, if we consider the extream incredibility of any other senses, that are offered, or can be offered.</p>

                  <hi>VIII.</hi> All other senses plainly impossible and incredible.</head>
               <p>For let us suppose first, that the sense is, <hi>Thou shalt not bow down to, nor worship the graven Image (that thou makest and settest up,) thou shalt not worship the Image it self instead of God or for God.</hi> It would be a prohibition of a thing even impossible to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature to do: that a Jew suppose should worship an Image that himself has made of some
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38541:8"/>
log of wood or stone, instead of or for the God that brought him out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the house of Bondage, &amp; indeed that created the whole World, as if he could take the Image for this God, and not worship it in reference to him. How nugatorious would they make the Divine Law-giver by such a prohibition, to interdict those things which it is impossible for men to doe? And now let us suppose the other sense of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to be, (and I can neither meet with nor devise any more,) <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy self any Idol,</hi> that is to say, no Image of any Heathen God or of any false God whatsoever; that this cannot be the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended sense thereof is plain. First, from the apparent superfluity of this precept, that being so strictly and apertly interdicted before, <hi>viz.</hi> That they should have no Pagan gods, nor any gods whatever besides <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Which while they hold to, it is impossible they should make to themselves any Images or Idols of those gods to bow down to or worship. So that this prohibition would be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, if that was the only meaning of the commandement. And then in the second place, this sense is incoherent with the words following; <hi>For I am a jealous God.</hi> Which implyes suspicion of some foul dealing betwixt any Member of his Spouse, the Church, and Himself; that they may communicate any thing of that which is peculiarly due to himself unto another. But if the Jews should make an Idol, that is, the Image of some Pagan God, and worship it, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would be past suspicion, they would apertly and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38541:9"/>
professedly be found false to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and to commit Adultery with another God.</p>

               </head>
               <p>To which you may add in the third place, that God himself has thus interpreted this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he will not be worshipped by an Image, though erected and worshipped in reference to himself; as is most undeniably plain in the golden Calf which <hi>Aaron</hi> made, which was not intended for the Image of <hi>Apis</hi> the <hi>AEgyptian</hi> God, but was the Symbolical presence of <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Indeed St. <hi>Steven</hi> sayes, Act. 7.39, 40. <hi>And in their hearts they turned back again into Aegypt,</hi> (it may be in the grossest sense if they could have brought <hi>Aaron</hi> to their lure) <hi>saying unto</hi> Aaron, <hi>make us Gods to go before us.</hi> But it is most likely, that this is only a reprehension of their <hi>AEgyptianizing</hi> in matters of Religion, desiring to have some visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Object and Figure to sustain their Faith, and spend their Devotion on, according to the mode of <hi>AEgypt,</hi> who gave Divine worship to Images.

enough insinuate, that an Image to the true God is not there forbid for worship but Idols only, or Images, of the Heathen Gods, or any false Gods. But those that argue thus do not consider that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Greek is of as indifferent and large a signification as <hi>Imago</hi> in Latin, or Image in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish. <hi>Plotinus,</hi> when he was desired to sit to have his Picture drawn, said, he would not have them give themselves the trouble of making <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, an Image of an Image, or Shadow of a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. So that we way with better reason ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the <hi>Septuagint</hi> to have chosen this word as an universal Bar against not only <hi>Statue-worship,</hi> but even <hi>Picture-worship</hi> also: Or to have made choice of <hi>Idolon,</hi> rather than <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Sculptile,</hi> because it signifieth more determinately such <hi>Sculptilia</hi> as are Images, or have Imagery on them, that they should not be bowed to in a religious way; not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding to direct their worship towards every thing that is carved, when it does not at all pretend to make God <hi>representable,</hi> as Imagery does.

               <p>And besides, suppose that <hi>Pesel</hi> signifies an Idol, in the sense of the adverse party; what do they get by it, when as the text then will run thus, <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy self any Idol or Image of any Heathen God, nor the likeness of any thing that is in Heaven above, or in the earth beneath,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38541:12"/>
thou shalt not bow down to them, nor worship them.</hi> It is manifest that yet for all this all manner of Image-worship, or Picture-worship is forbidden; not only of the Heathen Gods, but all whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and therefore they cannot be worshipped, no not in reference to the true God himself. Or if you would understand the following words, <hi>viz.

For the Image being visible, &amp; God invisible, there is manifest danger of joyning ones devotion, which is all that God can have of us, to the garish Image, more than to God, and the true Notion of him in our minds; and that by worshipping Him in such a vile manner, we may be brought off afterwards to worship other Gods, as mean as we have made him by this sort of worship.</p>

               <p>The next evasion, which seems most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, is, in that they pretend that God himself has interpreted his own Law to another sense than we would have, in commanding golden Cherubins to be set on the Mercy-seat for his own worship. This excuse is very trite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Romanists,</hi> and the second Council of <hi>Nice</hi> alledges the same, but it is plain that it falls exceeding short of the case. For the scope of the second Commandement is not the forbidding all Image-work in the places of worship, but the bowing to Images and worshipping them, which the case of the Cherubins does not reach. For the people was never commanded to bow down to or worship the golden Cherubins, nor do the Jews profess themselves to have done so, but to have bowed down to and worshipped God alone. And besides that they were not intended for an Object of the Peoples worship or adoration is plain, in that they were carefully hid from their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38541:13"/>
sight. And if they could penetrate with their imagination through the vail, and make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves present hard by the Cherubins, their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture plainly shows they were never intended to be worshipped, their faces not being turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the People to receive their salutations, but towards one another. Indeed if they were an object, that it was their declared duty to worship, when they saw them, the same religious affection may be conceived to be directed towards them through the vail. But formal adoration to a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble object while it is hid and made invisible, is, methinks, as uncouth and unnatural, as the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to some Person on the other side a brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, in which there is not the least loop-hole to see thorough. <unclear>Wherefore</unclear> there being no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to the people of the Jews, to bow down to the golden Cherubins, and to worship them, nor it being any professed practice of them, and the posture of the Cherubins being such as intimates they were not made to be worshipped by them, and they being carefully hid from the eyes of the people that they might not see them, (though they were symbols of the special presence of God, and Notes or Instruments for the directing their adoration thitherward to God in a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner there present) it is evident they were no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the peoples worship, and that they were neither to bow down to them, nor worship them, though they bowed toward them, as a determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive circumstance of their worship of God. This is so plain, that I believe no man that considers it

               <p>But the great difficulty, as it seems to some, is, how the High Priest, when he went into the Holy of Holies, (which he did once by the year,) and bowed as they conceive before these Cherubins bare and open to his sight, could so behave himself as not to be guilty of bowing to graven Images and worshipping them. Which if he did, I must confess that the Romanists have no contemptible plea for their interpretation of the second Commandement, as if it were not against worshipping the true God by an Image. But to this difficulty I answer these two wayes.</p>

                  <hi>XVI.</hi> The first way of answering it, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fact, if it could not be done without bowing towards the Cherubins as an object.</head>
               <p>First, that if the High Priest when he was in the Holy of Holies, could not bow to worship God by that gesture, but he must also bow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Cherubins <hi>objectively,</hi> and not meerly <hi>circumstantially,</hi> I do flatly deny that he did bovv there. And they can never prove that he did, there being no mention thereof in the Scripture, vvhere his behaviour in that place is described<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. But there being a plain prohibition in the second Commandement to bovv to graven Images and to vvorship them, it is from hence demonstrable that the High Priest in this case
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38541:14"/>
would not. For if <hi>to obey be better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of Rams,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 15.22. certainly the High Priest could not but see that obedience to so plain and strict a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as <hi>Thou shalt not bow down to any graven Images, nor worship them,</hi> &amp;c. was better than the breaking that command under pretence of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping God by bowing unto them, namely to the Cherubins. Wherefore we may be certain that in this case he would not bow towards them. But if he could bow towards them without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring this danger, the difficulty is taken away, and the true sense of the second Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remains firm and inviolable; that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is not to be worshipped by an Image, by bowing to it and worshipping it.</p>

               <p>But now besides this, in the second place, if any one think it so probable that the High Priest did bow some time towards the Mercy Seat, when he was in the Holy of Holyes, let us pitch upon that which is most likely, namely when he made his nearer approach thereto, to besprinkle it with blood: it is manifest there is no colour of saying, that in these circumstances he bowed to or worshipped the Cherubins.</p>

               <p n="2">2. But now, when the High Priest approaches up nearer to the Mercy seat, which we have supposed the more likely time of worshipping, let us see what possibility there is of his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of worshipping the Cherubins, though he should then bow towards the Throne of God, more than in that former circumstance. For the two Cherubins were placed at the two ends of the Mercy seat, and that with their faces one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another, not to any that came up to the Mercy seat, which is no fit posture to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped in, if they could be seen by any glimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in this thick Cloud of smoak. And if they could, they would be only a direction to the High Priest, as well to overlook them, as to give them a go by, in following that intimation God has given him in <hi>Exodus,</hi> Chap. 25. <hi>And
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38541:15"/>
there will I meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the Mercy seat, from between the two Cherubins, which are upon the Ark of the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi> And in the Psalms he is described sitting betwixt the two Cherubins, <hi>Psalm</hi> 8.1. and 99.1. This is a plain case then, that the High Priest could not but conceive that special presence of God to be seated betwixt the two Cherubins, and therefore directing his devotion and gesture according to that instruction, his bowing must be towards that presence, betwixt the two Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins, from the Mercy seat upwards; as if the invisible Majesty was seated there as on a Throne or Chair of state. The bowing to whom can no more concern the Cherubins, than the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Prince on a wide Throne or Chair can concern the imagery on the arms of the Chair a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, suppose, with two Eagles heads or the like. Can any one conceit any worship done to these two Eagles heads, when the Parties bowing is directed to the face and Person of the Prince above, and betwixt the Eagles heads; though the Eagles heads stand in a fairer posture to be bowed to, than the faces of the Cherubins. It is therefore every way plain and manifest, that as the People of the Jews did not, so neither did their High Priest bow to, or in any sense wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Cherubins in their bowing thitherward, but only him that sat betwixt the Cherubins, which was the thing to be demonstrated. And that therefore there is no evasion left to elude the force of the second commandement, that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38541:15"/>
so strictly prohibits the worship of the true God by any graven Image, which therefore according to the sense of that Commandement must be I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38541:16"/>
of those wise men of the Heathen who knew God, yet were so foolishly subtil and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical as to worship him in the Images of Men, Birds, four-footed Beasts and creeping things, which they could not but know, were but at the best Hieroglyphicks of him, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal representatives of his Godhead, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as they worshipped those Figures, they are said <hi>to have changed the glory of the incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God into the Images of these corruptible Creatures.</hi> For in worshipping these Images in reference to God, they naturally acknovvledg or suppose a fitness in them to represent the glory of God, or his Divine presence, vvhich therefore must needs be an unspeakable vilification of his infinite glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Majesty.

               <p>And that the vvorshipping of these represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Images in reference to God, is the giving of Divine vvorship to them, is manifest out of Scripture, as <hi>Acts</hi> 7. <hi>And they made a Calf in those dayes and sacrificed to the Idol.</hi> To say it vvas but <hi>sacrificium Relativum</hi> or <hi>Transitivum,</hi> that passed to God, not <hi>Terminativum,</hi> that termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Calf it self, is but School-cobvveb-stuff. Sacrifice is a peculiar vvorship belonging to God, and by no distinction or evasion can any thing else partake in it, so as to have it offered to it. This is evident in this kind of Divine vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and there is the same reason of them all. They vvorshipped the Calf in <hi>Horeb,</hi> but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as plainly appears out of the Historie, and therefore vvith <hi>Latria relativa,</hi> or <hi>transitiva</hi> not <hi>terminativa.</hi> But does this distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of so subtil Texture cover their chance? No certainly. If this distinction vvere good, and vvould justify their act, vvhy does either the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> or St. <hi>Steven</hi> find fault? It is apparent therefore that Divine vvorship is so due to God alone, that it is in no sense due to any thing else, but that even the meer natural or external act must be to him only. And therefore he will not be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped by an Image, that the Image may not in any sense partake of his worship; which yet it will in the natural externality thereof, if we do it towards the visible Image. For outwardly we behave our selves no otherwise
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38541:17"/>
towards the Image than towards God himself, nor make any other external Application to the one than to the other. As suppose there was an Image of God the Father in the shape of an Old man, and one would make his adoration to God towards this Image, with that mind, with that devout look, with that solemn and serious motion of the spirits in the eyes, that is befitting the profound reverence we owe to God, this natural, visible, and external act of worship passes plainly upon this Image, as well and in such sort as on God himself, and is such as no greater nor more lively expression of his highest devotion can be made by any suppliant. To whom then but to God alone can this belong? And therefore to make these expressions to a senseless stock and stone, is the foulest violation of the divine peculiarities that can be, by communicating them to so unworthy a subject, as well as by lessening, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuring, or rather abolishing the infinite glorious Majesty of the Godhead, by supposing him or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying him representable by a wretched Statue of wood, metal or stone, as I noted before.</p>

For <hi>quatenus Latria,</hi> it can pass no further in <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reality</hi> but ends there; and in relation to God the act ceases to be <hi>Latria,</hi> the honouring or worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of him, but changes its Species, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an act of contempt, reproach, and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience against him, and a foul dishonouring of him. Nor can the <hi>intention</hi> of the Religionist alter the specification of the Act, but that it will be a dishonouring of God, though the <hi>Act</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoided but it will have God for its <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> but he will be the Object of this Act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this specification namely of dishonour: As in that Physician that intended by such a Medicine
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38541:18"/>
to cure such a Patient, but does really poyson him thereby, the Patient notwithstanding the Physicians intention is no Object of a real cure, but of the quite contrary of his poysoning him. Wherefore no <hi>real Latria</hi> passing to God in this relative Idolatry, but only dishonour and reproach, the <hi>Latria</hi> is in <hi>truth</hi> (let the <hi>intention</hi> be what it will,) terminated in the Image or Idol, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is Idolatry, in the most proper and Scholastick sense. For one and the same Act, as it may have two contrary <hi>Specifications,</hi> in respect of two several Objects, so it may have two several <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations</hi> in respect of the same. As suppose one Person loves a Rose, another has a great Antipathy against it, a third brings a basket of Roses into the room; this one act is both a gratification and a displeasure; a gratification to him that loves Roses, a displeasure to him that has an Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy against them; the Act of gratification termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in one of these Objects, the Person that loves Roses, the Act of displeasure terminates on the other. Just so the Act of <hi>Latria</hi> or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honour terminates on the Image or Idol, the Act of dishonour and reproach on God, who is provoked and disobeyed. What can be more plain?

                  <hi>XXIV.</hi> Whether the doing Divine worship towards the Image of Christ violates the irrepresentableness of the Godhead or no, as also towards the holy Ghosts.</head>
               <p>But there is a more curious question whether the worshipping of the Image of Christ with Divine worship does involve also the other violation of the peculiarities of the Godhead in making it thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentable by an Image. For Christ being Man as well as God seems to make the case different from that of the Image of God the Father. But I answer the case is still the same, Christ being the eternal, infinite, glorious Majesty of God, as well as he is Man, and uncapable of Divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship but so far forth as he is that infinite Majesty. Wherefore he that sets up an Image, and calls it the Image of Christ, and does Divine worship to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, does as palpably make the eternal infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Majesty of the Godhead representable by a carved stock or stone, as he that does Divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship toward such a carved Image of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the Father and the Son are equal, and therefore the Son equally irrepresentable as to that of him which is capable of Divine worship, which this Image pretends to represent, in pretending to be the Image of Christ, and therefore violates that peculiarity of the infinite glorious Majesty of God, that makes it irrepresentable by any bodily Figure. He that worships Christ, worships the very God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and therefore must not blaspheme his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, by making him representable by any corporeal Image. The Godhead indeed is hypostatically in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templed in the humane nature of Christ, but it is the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38541:19"/>
the eternal and infinite divinity there that we adore. So little scruple need either Jevv or Turk have to turn Christians, upon any Idolatry vve are guilty of in vvorshiping Christ.</p>
               <p>And vvhat I have said of the Images or Statues of the Father and the Son, the same is to be said of the Image of the Holy Ghost. A Dove may be the Hieroglyphick of him as that description of the Ancient of dayes in <hi>Daniel</hi> is an Hieroglyphick of God the Father. But to do Divine worship to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward such an Image of a Dove, it is absolutely the same Idolatry that was in so doing to the Image of God the Father, and of Christ.</p>

               <p>No symbolical presence therefore or consistent visible animal figure saving the holy humanity of the Lord Jesus Christ, which is Hypostatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united with the eternal Divinity, can have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship done towards it, but it is Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <hi>ipso facto.</hi> It the peculiar priviledge of the holy humanity of Christ, to be capable of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving divine worship done towards it, because of its Union with the Divinity, as it is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the Body of a wise and vertuous Person, for the wisdom and vertues sake that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides only in his Soul, to have that great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence done towards it, by reason of the Soul with which it is Hypostatically united. But the Soul once separate by Death, the Body accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the common sense and practice of all men
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38541:20"/>
ceases to have that reverence done towards it that it had before. So that there is naturally a peculiar middle kind of honour, greater than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Creature besides has a capacity of, though less than Divine, that accrews to Christs huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in vertue of his being Hypostatically u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited with the Godhead, which the Image of Christ is not. And therefore besides that gross I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry above specified, in doing Divine worship towards his Image, there is also a violation of the priviledge of this holy humanity of Christ, towards which living Symbolical presence of the Godhead only it had been proper to do Divine worship, when he was visible here upon Earth; upon a clear declaration of this Union. Which was more apertly, and more seasonably manifested afterwards by St. <hi>John.</hi> But considering the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressable profound Humility of our Saviour, who upon ones saying to him, Good Master, straight way rebuked him, declaring there was none good but one, which is God, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.17. it seems hugely probable, that if any would have done express Divine worship towards his visible Humanity, as the <hi>Lycaonians</hi> would have sacrificed to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> that he would have decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it.

being Interpreter) assigned <hi>Latria relativa,</hi> which <hi>Azorius</hi> the Jesuite also acknowledges to be the constant opinion of the Roman Theologers. And indeed it seems necessary it should be so, to make the best sense of that kind of Religion: for they burn incense to these Images which is a sacrifice. And they putting up their prayers before them, and lifting up their eyes and hands towards them, with compellations common to the Image and Prototype, this is also the sacrifice of prayer offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them, as much if not more direct and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, than the sacrifices offered on the Altar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Golden Calf were to it; which yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was done on the Altar before that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, St. <hi>Steven</hi> full of the holy Ghost, declares, that they sacrificed unto the Idol.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it being so evident, that in these Cases they are to acknowledg that they give <hi>Latria</hi> to these Images, it seemed the wittiest and safest invention to declare in general, that the Images relating to God are to have <hi>Latria</hi> done to them, but not <hi>absoluta</hi> but <hi>relativa,</hi> which, they conceive, makes it an inferiour kind of <hi>Latria,</hi> since this Relative <hi>Latria</hi> (because of its Relativeness) is incompetible to God. But how well this will do their business, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready noted.</p>
               <p>But that this is the sense of their Church, even of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> it self, is noted and confessed by <hi>Azorius,</hi> and natural if not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for every one to acknowledg, that is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the worship of these Images. For if it

were not <hi>Latria relativa,</hi> but such a worship as the Images were capable of, and might be the ultimate Object of themselves, and it terminate there, how small and mean, and how lovv a kind of Worship would this be! So that it would prove to be a meer fooling or trifling with Images to no purpose, the worship of the Image though relating to God not at all advancing our ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of him, but rather necessarily casting us (by restraining the worship to what the Image it self is the ultimate object of,) into the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and meanest mode of worshipping that can be expressed, if it be but what it should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurate to so mean an Object. Wherefore it is altogether incredible, that this should be the meaning of worshipping of Images relating to God, or that any of the People that are taught to vvorship them, should not vvorship them vvith that height of affection and veneration they use to God, for as much as the Image relates to God, and that they are taught according to the very Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> that by the Image of Christ vvhich they vvorship, they vvorship Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. So plain is it, that the act of vvorship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Image relating to God, is an intended adoration of God himself, according the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for the occasional shuffles of any private Doctours of that Church, that would have the worship of incurvation, and the signs of devotion accompanying it, terminated on the Image it self, to make sure it may be in no sense <hi>Latria,</hi> at what a

loss vvill they be to ansvver touching the burning of incense, and praying to God before these Images that relate to him. Besides that the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement does plainly meet vvith such shufflers, vvhich universally forbids any bovving to, or vvorshipping Images relating to God, and vvill not be put off by any evasion. <hi>For I am a jealous God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Whence it it plain, that in invoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them one of the Divine peculiarities is viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or prophaned by being communicated to a Creature, when of right it is only to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God; the Saints having no such Omniper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiency or Omnipresency in them, as Doctour <hi>Thorndike</hi> himself cannot but confess, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I have noted at the end of my Reply.</p>
               <p>But to invoke them or pray to them for such things as it is in Gods power only to give, which all Papists do, as Dr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> plainly asserts, nor can it be put off upon pretence of a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive speech, (as I have proved in my Reply,) this is double Idolatry, as violating two Divine peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arities at once, both the Omnipresence or Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipercipience of God, and also his Omnipotence, they giving that power to a Creature which is in God alone. But making Vowes to any Saint or Angel in such dangers as a Creature may have power to rid us from, is but the same kind of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry that simple Invocation, if they be both mental, or both vocal.</p>

Angels, all which is manifestly done in reference to their invocation, it is thence plain, that all this is done to an Idolatrous end, and therefore upon this very consideration has the smut of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry upon it. But besides, more distinctly. God having appropriated these modes of being vvorshipped to himself, and his judgement being so infallible, vvhat befits him and is most proper for him, when he will be vvorshipped in a more <hi>external</hi> and <hi>ritual</hi> vvay, it is evident presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and prophanation of the peculiarities of his Godhead, as to <hi>external</hi> vvorship, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them to the Creature, as I have proved in my Antidote. And lastly, the very nature of the thing demonstrates the Idolatry, they being stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing significations of the natural peculiarities of God communicated to a Creature. For a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Symbolical presence is fitly and secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly erected to God, because we are sure of Gods residence and presence there, as <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> intimates the inhabitation of the Divinity in it. Let there be as many Symbolical Presences and Temples as you will, and at what distance you will, God is certainly at home in them all, as being Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present. But for a finite invisible Power or Spirit, though there were but one erected thereto, there is no assurance of that Spirits residence there, or if the effect of any Spirit be there, that it is not some other Spirit than he to whom the Temple or Symbolical presence was erected, that it is not one Angel or Saint for another, nay, a Divel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of that Saint or Angel. But those Temples
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38541:23"/>
and Symbolical presences being erected in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral distant places, it emplyes they are in several distant places at once, which is the only peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity of the Godhead; as I have noted in my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. Which incongruities are also to be observed in either one single Altar, or many in distant places of the World, to the same Saint or Angel. And besides it has that odious relation to a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and imports that the Saints and Angels are also sacrificed to, which is plain and confessed Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>

               <p>As neither their <hi>Artolatria</hi> does to them that are free and believe that which is most certainly true, that the bread is not transubstatiated, as I have again and again undeniably demonstrated it not to be in my <hi>Antidote against Idolatry,</hi> and in my <hi>Reply.</hi> The clearness of which demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the pretended intricacies in the mystery of the holy Trinity cannot obscure; there being so vast a difference both betwixt the Objects them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and the faculties in this case, and that. For in Transubstantiation the Object is Matter or
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38541:25"/>
body, a substance finite and comprehensible both by our senses and reason. In the mystery of the Trinity, the object is the infinite incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Deity, a substance incorporeal, or spirit, which is quite out of the reach of our senses in the lowest notion thereof; but the transcendency of the Triune Godhead above our reason also, though not contrary unto it. And then our faculties conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant about Transubstantiation, are all the five senses rightly circumstantiated, the organ, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and medium duly fitted and proportionated, and therefore the senses necessarily capable of discerning what the object is, whether this body or that, suppose whether the body of a man, or a piece of bread. And besides this, not only the exteriour reason, but that which the Greeks call <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>XXXIV.</hi> That the believing the bread not to be there, does not all clear the Romanists from down-right Bread-worship which is Idolatry.</head>
               <p>And I must confess I was once inclinable to this opinion my self, that in this case they are not I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolaters (see my <hi>Idea of Antichristianisme,</hi> Book 1. Chap. 13. sect. 6.) before I had more closely and carefully considered the point. And the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not want at this day witty Patrons, and of admirable art and eloquence, to perswade the heedless into this security, That though the bread should not prove transubstantiated, yet they cannot be bread-worshippers, while they believe it is; for if they believe it is transubstantiated, they believe it not to be there, namely within the <hi>Symbols</hi> or <hi>Species,</hi> and thence they pretend it is demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively evident that they cannot worship it, but only Christ, into whose substance it is believed to be transubstantiated. For whatever is taken, say they, for an object of worship, the understanding must affirm, (either truly or falsly,) that it is there whither the worship is directed. Which arguing bears a smart plausibility with it. But I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, That what is made an object of worship through mistake, there is no need the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affirm it is there, but rather the contrary. For it does not think the undue object is there but the due one. Those that worshipped the Sun, that is, that which we call the Sun, and understand thereby a flammeous body devoid of sense and understanding,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38541:26"/>
that appears alike to the sight of the Sun-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers, and to ours, (as the species appear the same to those that believe the bread transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated, and to them that believe it not,) be it called what it will, they did not believe that which we know to be the Sun, to be there, but an intellectual Deity, which the Sun is not; and yet we all acknowledg them for all that to have been Sun-worshippers and Idolaters. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore using <hi>just weights and measures,</hi> we must conclude the Romanists Bread-worshippers and Idolaters, the bread not being transubstantiated, since their worship then lights upon bread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Christ, as the Sun-worshippers upon the Sun instead of an intelligent Deity. He that strikes his Friend in the dusk of the Evening, thinking it is his Enemy, thinks his friend is not there, who notwithstanding finds himself the Object of his stroak, and wishes he had not been there. This Idolatry I must confess is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through mistake, but so is all Idolatry that is committed in good earnest, so that this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not excuse the fact from so grievous a crime. And that it is Idolatry is evident, Divine worship being given to a piece of bread, which is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity of the Godhead, and must be given to none but him. And the violation of any Divine peculiarity is Idolatry by the proposed definition thereof.</p>

               <p>It remains now only that we free several Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies used in our own Church from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Idolatry, by application to this defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, as well as we have evinced several of theirs to be Idolatrous by the same. Which will be a no less useful, and it may be a more pleasant consideration to our own, to see how little hold the adverse party can take of these small strings to pull us back again into Popery. For if the definition of Idolatry be unapplicable to them, it is manifest they cannot be Idolatrous. And the inapplicability is so easily discoverable, that there will be no need to insist long on this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In the general then we are to note what a vast difference there is betwixt religious worship properly so called, which is the same with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship, and pious or religious affection and respect, or preference of one thing before another,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38541:27"/>
for its relation it has to the objects, or exercise of our Religion, or Divine worship. It is but an homely Proverb, <hi>Love me and love my dog,</hi> but it may be of no impertinent significancy in this place. For it is not understood of the love of friendship, but of such a love as that inferiour Creature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, and is fit to give him in relation to his Master, to whom we owe the love of friendship. So they that have a real Divine reverence for God, it is no wonder they find an inclination in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of bearing some reverence, or having some respect to those things or persons, that in a special manner relate to him. Whether it be Priest or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or any holy utensil or the like. Which reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is quite different from that Divine worship or reverence that is due to God himself, (more different than the love to ones Friend, and to his Spaniel,) and therefore can be no peculiarity of the Godhead, and consequently no violation of his peculiarities to give it to another. Which is the true Notion of Idolatry.</p>

               <p>We will illustrate this with some few examples, and so conclude. They that keep off their hats in the Church, and do it even then when Divine Service is not a doing there, are not by any means conceived to do that Divine reverence or worship which is peculiarly due to God, unto the fabrick they are under, but because this place is set apart for holy uses, and is of a different nature from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary places that have no such relation to God and his Divine worship, out of an habitual deep devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38541:27"/>
toward God they also express this more infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour affection and reverence to the place of his worship, by way of distinction and preference of it before other common places, be they never so mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificently built. Which is not to give it a reverence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing equal or of the same kind with that we give to God, but only a greater and another sort of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence than we would give to any place that is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to him. And this is no more Idolatry than <hi>Moses</hi> his putting off his shooes, because the ground was hallowed by the special presence of God there. And therefore it was not unfit to show some reverence thereto in those circumstances, and not to prophane it and soyl it by his dirty shooes. Nay, indeed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, having that express command of God for it. Or if one should do so of himself in such a meaning of reverence as I have intimated, though it might be superstitious under Christianity, yet it could not be Idolatrous, no peculiarities of the Godhead being violated thereby.</p>

And if the Church for uniformity sake appoint one place rather than another, so long as it is but towards it only, it can be no Idolatry.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38541:29"/>
and of his blood shed for us. Which therefore are not the Person of Christ, nor Hypostatically united to his Person in this condition, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the symbols thereof cannot be any sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical presence, as I have also noted in my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</hi> The Altar therefore has the honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a directive instrument <hi>whither,</hi> as the Church has <hi>where</hi> to do divine worship. But the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is no more done <hi>to</hi> the Altar, by being done <hi>towards</hi> it, than it is done <hi>to</hi> the Church by being done <hi>in</hi> it. Forasmuch as there is no Animal Figure thereon, as the Ancient Pagans conceived their Gods to appear in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral such shapes, and therefore worshipped them in them. For this would be a personal representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and so receptive of the worship done towards it, according to the manifest sense of Scripture, and natural interpretation of reason, but here being no such Statue or Image there erected all is safe.</p>
               <p>Wherefore all the honour the Altar receives in these adorations made towards it is this, that it is used as a directive instrument for people to show which way they are to set their faces, when they make these adorations to God, which is far from giving any Divine worship to the Table or Altar, and therefore is far out of the reach of our definition of Idolatry.</p>

               <p>And so whereas all the names and attributes of God are holy, and we have a greater reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for them, than for any words or names that do not relate to God, (though we do not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38541:29"/>
owe Divine worship or reverence to them, for as much as they are not God, but words that pass away as other sounds do,) whereas I say, all the names of God are holy, yet because the name Jesus exhibits to us the manifestation of God in the most endearing circumstances; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Mysteries celebrated on the Altar caused that preference of it before all other parts of the Church for to do our worship <hi>towards,</hi> so this name of Jesus above all other Names or words, that signify God or his attributes, may well be made use of to determine the time and occasion <hi>when</hi> in Divine service we should more exuberantly vent our devotion in the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God our Saviour, especially the Scripture seeming to hint some such thing to us. And this is the honour done to the Name of Jesus, that at the naming thereof we take occasion to do profound reverence and Divine worship to our eternal Redeemer.

Which I should think would be hard for any man to imagine, that is conscious to himself, what a motion the Soul is in, when it does an act of real and sincere adoration, or Divine worship, and considers what it is to be in any sense the Object thereof. He would find it such horrid ill Syntax, to make any thing in any sense the object of adoration besides God, that he would be utterly ashamed of it, and find it more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous and incongruous, more impertinent and troublesome, than if one when he were to worship

               <p>And lastly, (for this is an argument so copious
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:38541:34"/>
that a man may easily lose himself in it) It is well known and cannot be denied but that God is the ultimate end of all. He is so in himself, and ought to be acknowledged so by us both in our words and actions. Wherefore if we make our selves the ultimate end of our actions, and our own Happiness as our own, and not as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will and nature of God, so that we serve and worship God for our own sakes, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were a crafty bargain with the all-wise God, and performing it too (which is worst of all) no further than it stands with our own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent ease, security and interest, preferring these before his will and command, this also is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Spiritual Idolatry, and we again make an Idol of our selves in making our selves the ultimate end of our Actions. For there can be but one ultimate end, which is the will of the Father, the light of the knowledg of God in the face of Jesus Christ manifested in us, who is the brightness of his glory and express Image of his person. Who declared in the flesh, he came not to doe his own will, but the will of him that sent him.</p>
               <p>This therefore is the supreme Law and will of God touching the purity of his worship, that we have no will nor end of our own. For as we are to have but one God, <hi>Hear O Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, the Lord thy God is one God,</hi> Deut. 6.4. so we are to have but one will, even the will of the God whom we worship. Which we have not, if we have any self-will, or self-ends, unsubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the will of God. Whose Will and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:38541:34"/>
Law is the Law of an <hi>unself-interested Love</hi> that is ready to act, and content to suffer any thing for the Good of the Creation of God, be it never so bitter and painful, as was most exemplarily conspicuous in our blessed Saviour. And of this it is that that bosome friend of our Lord Jesus witnesses in the close of his Epistle, John 5.20. <hi>And we know that the Son of God is come, and has given us an understanding that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. Little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, keep your selves from Idols.</hi> Amen.</p>
