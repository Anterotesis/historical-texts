            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The powers of the fleſh are to be made ſervants
unto the <hi>promiſed ſeed;</hi> and now comes the
time that the elder ſons, that are born after the

            <p>You are the <hi>Abrahamites</hi> in whom the <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi>
remaines, that lives not now in the <hi>type,</hi>
but enjoyes the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of circumciſion; <hi>For
he is not a Jew, that is one outward in the
fleſh; but he is a Jew, that is one inward,
whoſe circumciſion is of the heart:</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be born of the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> extant
in the world, or whether he be one born of other
Nations in whom the <hi>bleſſing</hi> remains; it is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
promiſed ſeed that makes a <hi>Jew;</hi> and
theſe are they of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Salvation is
of the Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What was that ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the bleſſing?</p>
            <p>It is the Law and power of righteouſneſſe,
which made <hi>Abraham</hi> to forſake his <hi>Iſaac,</hi>
his
deareſt relations in the fleſh, rather then he would
<pb facs="tcp:35008:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
refuſe the way of his Maker; and herein <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
found peace: So that this King of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
and this Prince of peace that ruled in
<hi>Abraham,</hi> is the bleſſing of all Nations, for
this ſhall ſave his people from their ſins, and free
them from all diſtempers of the unrighteous fleſh.
This is the one ſpreading power that ſhall remove
the curſe, and reſtore all things from the bondage
every thing groans under.</p>
            <p>This is called <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, becauſe <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
ſprang from him, as a tree grows from the
ſeed, which gave the tree its being and its name:
And the Law of righteouſneſſe and peace, dwelling
and ruling in any one is the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and the ſeverall branches of men and women in
whom that power reſts, are children and of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For it was not the man of the fleſh that was
called <hi>Abraham,</hi> but the Law of righteouſneſſe
and peace, that did rule and govern in that body,
he was the <hi>Abraham;</hi> the fleſh is honoured with
ſuch a name by him that dwelt therein; the name
of the fleſh before this righteous power was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
in it, was Abram.</p>
            <p>As the humane body called Chriſt, was not the
anointing, but the Spirit in that body, was the
Chriſt, or the ſpreading power of righteouſneſſe,
which was to fill the earth with himſelf. That
body was but a houſe or temple for the preſent
work, which was to draw down <hi>Moſes</hi> Law,
<pb facs="tcp:35008:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and become the ſubſtance of his types, and lambs,
and ſacrifices; for that body was the lamb, that
did fulfill the righteous will, by his voluntary
and free-will offering up of himſelf, without
forcing.</p>
            <p>So then: This Law of righteouſneſſe and peace,
is <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed; nay that manifeſtation in
that humane body, was <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf; for
<hi>Abraham</hi> is known to the Creation, by acting
in or from that power that ruled the fleſh. And
every man or woman, born of <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi>
in whom this power rules and breaks forth, are
the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the man <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
in whom the ſpirit dwelt in a leſſe meaſure;
for he hath failings, was a type of the Man Chriſt
Jeſus, in whom the Law of righteouſneſſe and
peace dwelt bodily, for there was no ſin or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe
in that body.</p>
            <p>Therefore Chriſt hath the honour above his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
to be called the ſpreading power, becauſe
he fils all with himſelf; And becauſe this power
did appear to the Creation firſt in <hi>Abraham</hi> of
all men we hear of, therefore every one that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
after him, and that are ruled by the ſame
Law, are called children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of that ſeed.</p>
            <p>But Chriſt the anointing he hath the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
for <hi>Abraham</hi> ſprang from him, and all
<hi>Abrahamits</hi> are but a tree or vine that did
ſpring from that one ſeed: for indeed the ſpirit
<pb facs="tcp:35008:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of life, lies in the bottom, which lifted up both
<hi>Abraham</hi> and his children, and is the one ſeed
of righteouſneſſe and life, from which every one
ſprings, what name ſoever any righteous body is
called.</p>
            <p>Now this ſeed doth promiſe himſelf to be the
bleſſing of all Nations, and the reſtorer of all
things from bondage; but the Nations of the earth,
ſince that report was made, never yet enjoyed the
benefit of it; for the curſe hath ſtill reſted upon
the Creation, and hath been rather multiplied
from year to year; ſo that at this very day, thoſe
in whom the firſt fruits of reſtauration appears,
do ſee darkneſſe, nay thick darkneſſe do cover
man-kind: And the curſe doth reſt mightily in
the fire, water, earth and air; all places ſtinks
with the abomination of the curſe; So that a man
can go into no place, but he ſhall ſee the curſe and
enmity is that power that rules the creatures, that
makes them jar one againſt another.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe miſerry breaks forth upon man-kind,
from theſe four Elements of which his body is
made, and the curſe reſts within him, and the
curſe dwels round about him; But <hi>Abrahams</hi>
ſeed, is and muſt be the bleſſing of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and ſhall ſpread as far as the curſe hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſpread,
to take it off.</p>
            <p>And this ſeed (Dear Brethren) hath lien hid
in you, all the time appointed, and now is break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth. And the Nations ſhall know, That
<pb facs="tcp:35008:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſalvation or reſtauration rather, is of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
that King of righteouſneſſe and Prince of peace,
that removes the curſe, and becomes himſelf the
bleſſing, ariſes up in you, and from you, and fils,
and will fill the earth, both man-kind, and the
whole Creation, Fire, Water, Earth and Air, for
the bleſſing ſhall be every where.</p>
            <p>And though the ſeed of the fleſh have caſt you
out for evil, and you have been the deſpiſed ones
of the earth, and the children of the fleſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes
to buy and ſell with you, yet now your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is riſing. And the ancient propheſie of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie</hi>
ſhall be fulfilled, <hi>That ten men ſhall
take hold of the skirt of him that is a
Jew, ſaying, Let us go with you, for we
have heard that God is with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This new Law of righteouſneſſe and peace,
which is riſing up, is <hi>David</hi> your King, which
you have been ſeeking a long time, and now ſhall

In other writings I have declared what I know, That
Almighty power &amp; ever living Spirit is, which rules
and preſerves the whole Creation; fire, water earth
and air, and of every creature in theſe elements; or
that is made up of all theſe in a compound matter
as all fleſh is. And ſomething I ſhall here add to the
reſt, which I only hold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orth to my fellow creature,
man; not cuſtomarily to make a trade of it, for
fleſhly ends, but occaſionally as the Light is pleaſed
to manifeſt himſelf in me;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 3, 4.</note> that others from me, and
I from them may be witneſſes each to other, of our
Maker how he ſhines forth in his own light, through
each other to the profit of the Creation.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of time the whole Creation lived
in man, and man lived in his Maker, the ſpirit of
Righteouſneſſe and peace, for every creature walked
evenly with man, and delighted in man, and was
ruled by him; there was no oppoſition between
him and the beaſt, ſowls, fiſhes, or any creature in
the earth: ſo that it is truely ſaid, The whole Creation
was in man, one within, and walked even with him;
for no creature appeared to be a viſible enemy to
him: for every creature gave forth it ſelf, either for
pleaſure or profit of man, who was Lord of all: And
man lived in his Maker the Spirit, and delighted
in no other; there was an evennes between man and
all creatures, and an evenneſſe between man and
his Maker the Lord, the Spirit.</p>
               <p>But when man began to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>all out of his Maker,
and to leave his joy and reſt which he had in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Righteouſneſſe, and ſought content from crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and outward objects, then he loſt his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the creature fell out of him, and became
enemies and appoſers of him, and then riſe up
mountaines, and valleys, and hils, and all uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
both in mans heart, and in mans actions. And
as the man is become ſelfiſh; ſo are all the beaſts
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35008:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and creatures become ſelfiſh; and man and beaſt
act like each other, by puſhing with their horns of
power, and devouring one another to preſerve ſelf.</p>
               <p>And truly as man might ſee all creatures lived at
reſt in him in the beginning, ſo he may ſee all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
in him now, but in a reſt-leſſe condition, groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under bondage, waiting for a reſtauration. The
covetouſneſſe, the ſubtilty, the cruelty, the pride,
the envy, the devouring power that is in the fleſh
of man are the very diſtempers that are in ſuch and
ſuch beaſts and fowls: So that while man is ruled
by ſuch powers, and declares no other actions but
what is in the beaſt; he indeed goes in the ſhape of
a man, but properly he is a beaſt of ſuch and ſuch a
ravenous principle. And this now is the Curſe, Man
is gone out of his Maker, to live upon objects; and
the creatures are gone out of man, to ſeek delight
in puſhing and devouring one another, and the
whole Creation of fire, and water, earth and air;
and all bodies made of theſe are put out of order,
through mans rejecting the Spirit to live upon
objects.</p>
               <p>But now the time is come, that the Spirit will
draw all things into man againe, to live and be at
reſt in him, as their Governour, as their Lord, and
man and the Creation ſhall become even againe,
and ſo man returning to his Maker, to reſt in peace
in none but him. The whole Creation ſhall be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned,
preſerved &amp; comforted by the one ſpirit, the
King of Righteouſneſſe, and all bondage, curſe and
tears ſhall be done away: And this is that I wait for,
being aſſured it ſhall be accompliſhed, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a taſte.</p>
               <p>But as the ſtate of the world is, in the generality,
I am made to ſee, That in times paſt and times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
the branches of man-kind have acted like the
beaſt or ſwine; And though they have called one
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35008:9"/>
another, men and women, yet they have been but
the ſhadows of men and women. As the Moone is
the ſhadow of the Sun,<note place="margin">Rom, 8, 13</note> in regard they have been
led by the powers of the curſe in fleſh, which is the
<hi>Feminine</hi> part; not by the power of the righteous
Spirit which is Chriſt,<note place="margin">Epbeſ. 2. 2.</note> the <hi>Maſculine</hi> power.</p>
               <p>But when they come to ſee the ſpirituall Light
that is in every ceature, and in that power and light
do walk righteouſly towards other creatures, as
well beaſts as man-kinde, that the creation as much
as in them lies one by one,<note place="margin">Pſal. 36. 9.</note> may be upheld and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in its glory; then they begin to appear and
act like men; and riſe up from the low earth of a
beaſtly and ſwiniſh nature, to acknowledge and
honour their Maker in the light of himſelf.</p>
               <p>Experience ſhews us That every beaſt doth act in
oppreſſion and cruelty, towards ſuch creatures, as
he can maſter at advantage. And thus doth the fleſh
of man,<note place="margin">Rev. 13. 4</note> which is the King of beaſt: For when the
wiſdome and power of the fleſh raigns, which in
deed is <hi>Adam,</hi> that man that appeared firſt to rule
the earth, man-kinde, and by his unrighteouſneſſe
makes it a land of barrenneſſe: For this firſt <hi>Adam</hi>
is ſuch a ſelfiſh power, that he ſeeks to compaſſe all
the creatures of the earth into his own covetous
hands, to make himſelf a lord, and all other his
ſlaves.</p>
               <p>And though he gets lands, moneys, honours, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
into his hands, yet he gives the King of
righteouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 21 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>2.</note> but a company of ſawning words of
love and obedience; for he makes unrighteouſneſſe
to dwell in heaven and earth, that is, in the whole
Creation, by his unrighteous government, and ſo he
becomes the chief Rebell, the Serpent, the Devil,
the Murderer, oppreſſing the Creation, ſetting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
above all in tyranny: And this power is the
curſe which the whole Creation groans under,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35008:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
waiting for a reſtoration by Chriſt the King and law
of rigteouſneſſe, who is the reſtorer of all things.</p>
               <p>And here firſt I ſhall declare what <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt
man is, who to me appears to be the wiſdome and
power of the fleſh, carrying along the Creation, man,
to live upon creature objects, and to loath and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
the Spirit that made all, and that dwels in all
things according to the capacity of every ſingle crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
and all that <hi>Adam</hi> doth is to advance himſelf
to be, The one power; he gets riches and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into his hands, that he may lift up himſelf, and
ſuppreſſe the univerſall liberty, which is Chriſt. And
if he preach, or pray, or performe any ſervice rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to the Spirit, it is for this end, that he may get
peace thereby, and ſo ſeeks to honour fleſh by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
his own peace, by his own wit and pollicy
if that would doe.</p>
               <p>So that this <hi>Adam</hi> appears firſt in every man and
woman; but he ſits down in the chair of Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
in ſome above others; for though this climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
power of ſelf-love be in all, yet it riſes not
to its height in all; but every one that gets an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
into his hands, tyrannizes over others; as
many huſbands, parents, maſters, magiſtrates, that
lives after the fleſh, doe carry themſelves like op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
Lords over ſuch as are under them; not
knowing that their wives, children, ſervants, ſubjects
are their fellow creatures, and hath an equall privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to ſhare with them in the bleſſing of liberty.</p>
               <p>And this firſt <hi>Adam</hi> is to be ſeen and known in
a two-fold ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He is the wiſdome and power of the fleſh
in every man, who indeed is the beaſt, and he
ſpreads himſelf within the Creation, man, into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
branches; As into ignorance of the Creatour of
all things, into covetouſneſſe after objects, into
pride and envy, lifting up himſelf above others, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35008:10"/>
ſeeking revenge upon all that croſſes his ſelfiſh ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;
and into hypocriſie, ſubtilty, lying imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſelf-love; from whence proceeds all unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
outward acting. This is the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> lying, rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d dwelling within man-kinde. And this is he
within every man and woman, which makes whole
man-kinde, being a priſoner to him, to wonder af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the beaſt, which is no other but ſelf, or upon
every thing whereupon ſelf is ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>amped.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> is the wiſdome and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of fleſh broke out and ſate down in the chair of
rule and dominion, in one part of man-kind over
another. And this is the beginner of particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
buying and ſelling the earth from one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
hand to another, ſaying, <hi>This is mine,</hi> uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this particular propriety by a law of government
of his own making, and thereby reſtraining other
fellow creatures from ſeeking nouriſhment from
their mother earth. So that though a man was bred
up in a Land, yet he muſt not worke for himſelf
where he would ſit down. But from <hi>Adam;</hi> that is,
for ſuch a one that had bought part of the Land, or
came to it by inheritance of his deceaſed parents,
and called it his own Land: So that he that had no
Land, was to work for thoſe for ſmall wages,
that called the Land theirs; and thereby ſome are
lifted up into the chair of tyranny, and others trod
under the foot-ſtool of miſery, as if the earth were
made for a few, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for all men.</p>
               <p>For truly the common-people by their labours,
from the firſt riſe of <hi>Adam,</hi> this particular imtereſt
upheld by the fleſhes law to this day, they have lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up their Land-lords and others to rule in tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and oppreſſion over them. And let all men ſay
what they will, ſo long as ſuch are Rulers as cals the
Land theirs, upholding this particular propriety of
<hi>Mine and Thine;</hi> the common-people ſhall never have
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35008:10"/>
their liberty, nor the Land ever freed from troubles,
oppreſſions and complainings; by reaſon whereof
the Creatour of all things is continually provoked. O
thou proud ſelfiſh governing <hi>Adam,</hi> in this Land cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>England!</hi> Know that the cries of the poor, whom
thou laieth heavy oppreſſions upon, is hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d.</p>
               <p>This is unrighteous <hi>Adam,</hi> that dammed up
the water ſprings of univerſall liberty, and brought
the Creation under the curſe of bondage, ſorrow
and tears: But when the earth becomes a common
treaſury as it was in the beginning, and the King of
Righteouſneſſe comes to rule in every ones heart,
then he kils the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> for covetouſneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
is killed. A man ſhall have meat, and drinke and
clothes by his labour in freedome, and what can be
deſired more in earth. Pride and envy likewiſe is
killed thereby, for every one ſhall look upon each
other as equall in the Creation; every man indeed
being a parfect Creation of himſelf. And ſo this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Adam</hi> Chriſt, the reſtorer, ſtops or dammes
up the runnings of thoſe ſtinking waters of ſelf-intereſt,
and cauſes the waters of life and liberty to
run plentifully, in, and through the Creation, making
the earth one ſtore-houſe, and every man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to live in the law of Righteouſneſſe and peace
as members of one houſhold.</p>
               <p>And in the next place I ſhall declare the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of the Spirit in a two-fold way:</p>
               <p>Firſt, he makes the Creation, man-kinde, to ſee,
loa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h and forſake this <hi>Adam,</hi> this fleſhly man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
This devil or power of darkneſſe that rules in the
creatures, and leads them into waies that brings
miſery, pain and death, which is hell, a condition
of uncomfortable darkneſſe of the curſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He makes man-kinde to ſee, to love
and delight in the Spirit Reaſon, which is the law of
Righteouſneſſe, that made them, and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tles them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35008:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in peace; when in the light and power thereof, they
are made to forſake the fleſh with all his wayes of
bondage; for truly when the fleſh is made ſubject
to Reaſon, that light that inlightens every thing, then
it hath peace and liberty, and is freed from thoſe
heart-aking preſſures and ſorrows, which the fleſh
puls upon himſelf by his violent, raſh, unrighteous,
and unreaſonable actings.</p>
               <p>The Almighty hath declared three methods in
diſcovering this myſtery in the compaſſe of ſix dayes,
or 6000 years near hand expired; in every one of
which he draws man-kind higher and higher into
himſelf, out of the power of the Serpent or bondage.
And when he alone is advanced, he draws all men
after him, which is the finiſhing up of the myſtery.</p>
               <p>The firſt Method is this: He was pleaſed to call
forth <hi>Moſes</hi> to be his ſervant, and in, by and through
him, he reveals himſelf to lie under types, ſhadows,
ſacrifices; that man-kind by them might be led to
ſee his Maker; And this was the Covenant of an
outward teſtimony, which <hi>Moſes,</hi> a man that was
mixed with fleſh and ſpirit, was Mediatour of. And
this</p>
               <p>Secondly did point out the Apoſtolical teſtimony
which was to be manifeſted in aftertimes; and that
was to acknowledge honour, and bear witneſſe of
the Lamb Jeſus Chriſt, that was the ſubſtance of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi>
For the Apoſtles declare themſelves to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of Chriſt, the great Prophet, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid
ſhould come after him,<note place="margin">Act. 3. 22.</note> to whom every man ſhould
hearken, and then leave the teachings of ſhadows,
which they receive from him.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſay they, <hi>We eat and drank in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
we heard him ſpeak, and ſaw his miracles, and
bear teſtimony to the world, that the Rulers of the Jews
ſlew him, and that he was raiſed from the dead by the
Almighty power.</hi> And this ſingle appearance of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35008:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man Chriſt Jeſus (for herein the righteous Law
dwelt bodily) was a more ſpirituall declaration then
the former. And this types out</p>
               <p>The third Method of Divine diſcovery,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 6.</note> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
doth finiſh the myſtery; and herein the Lord
takes up all into himſelf, even into the Spirit that
governs the Creation; for he is in all, and acts
through all. And all power of righteouſneſſe that
appears in any ſubject is ſtill but the Lord, in ſuch
or ſuch a diſcovery; for as the man Chriſt Jeſus ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up <hi>Moſes;</hi> and ſo the Spirit dwelt bodily in
that Lamb, which was ſpread abroad in the types;
And man-kind is to behold the Law of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
in none,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 22 23.</note> but in that his wel-beloved
Son.</p>
               <p>Even ſo that ſingle body is a type:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13.</note> That the ſame
Spirit that filled every member of that one body,
ſhould in theſe laſt dayes be ſent into whole man-kind,<note place="margin">Act. 2. 17.</note>
and every branch ſhall be a joint or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

to the inward teachings of Chriſt, and the ſpreading

               <p>By theſe words, The Son of man declares, that

               <p>So that upon the riſing up of Chriſt in ſons and

as his due right by courſe. So that you ſee here is
the dividing of time. But this laſt miniſtration is
the ſufferer for the preſent, as being denied his right
by the former, that ought to give way.</p>
               <p>And as the worſhippers in <hi>Moſes</hi> miniſtration,
envied and killed ſuch as worſhipped the Son of man,
the Lamb: So now, thoſe that worſhip Chriſt at a

and are moſt zealous therein, are in theſe dayes the
moſt bittereſt enemies to the miniſtration of Chriſt
in Spirit and in truth.</p>
               <p>But when this miniſtration of the Spirit ſpreads
himſelf, he will make the greateſt ſeparation that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

amazed the world, and the ſeparation of gathered
Congregations out of Pariſh Churches (ſo called) did
trouble the earth, though it is no more but going out
of one form into another, not into the unitie of the

riſing up by right of inheritance, will take peace
from the world much more: for he hath begun,
and he will and ſhall go on, to gather the ſcattered

pull miſeries and ſhame upon your ſelves; as the

the Sonne of man: Therefore be patient, look up
for teaching in this dividing of time, when the Law
of Righteouſneſſe ariſes up; and makes himſelf more

               <p>Now ſearch the Scriptnres, you that ſtand up to

them judge me,<note place="margin">Joh: 5 45.</note> whether I deny them or no; but
one thing you ſhall finde to your ſhame, that
thoſe Scriptures of the Prophets and Apoſtles,

to ſtone you out of your Pulpits; for you doe not
profeſſe thoſe Scriptures in love to them,<note place="margin">Joe: 2. 15.</note> but in

               <p>For now when Chriſt begins to ariſe up in ſons

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35008:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you will ever have people to be hearing you ſpeak
the declaration, becauſe you live by it; but if
any receive the power from on high, you cry out

               <p>And therefore this one Almighty power began to

experience of one ſingle creature, man, by

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35008:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Creation, that man may be the mouth that ſhall
make a clear diſcovery of Chriſt to others from the
teſtimony that is in himſelf; for hee is to ſee
Chriſt within himſelf, before hee can ſee him in
other creatures. And therefore,</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Sripture in their ſeverall declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
types, prophecies, viſions, voyces, revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
actings of men, in patient doing and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in righteouſneſſe, is no other but Chriſt in the
letter, lying under the experimentall words of thoſe
Pen-men, ſetting forth the one Almighty, in his
ſeverall actings,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 9.</note> and his ſeverall conditions, wherein
he hath appeared to the view of the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but ſeen and known only, by the one creature,
man, in whom hee is purpoſed to dwell bodily.</p>
               <p>But ſtill here is a large diſtance between Chriſt
and the bulk of man kinde; for though ſome few
particular ones have ſeen him, and could declare
him, yet others are ignorant of him: So that the
univerſalitie of man-kinde may ſee theſe two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criptions
of Chriſt, that is in the Creation, and in
the Scriptures, both without themſelves.</p>
               <p>And when any attains to ſee Chriſt in theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
diſcoveries, it is full of ſweet delight, but
this ſettles no true peace; for that delight that is
fetching in from things at a diſtance from us, may be
loſt againe, and return into its proper ſeat againe:
As the pleaſant beames is of the Sun, which refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
the outward man, may be loſt, for when the
Clouds come between, the beames returne into the
Sun again, which is their proper ſeat, and men loſeth,
the refreſhing, wramth and hear. And therefore,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt or the ſpreading power of light,
is drawing the knowledge of himſelf,<note place="margin">Ier. 31. 34.</note> as he lies in
all things,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 22.</note> into the clear experience of man, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whole man, yea, into every brench of man-kinde
and he the Sonne of Righteouſneſſe will not only

ſhine into, but fix hinſelf in every one. So that
perfect man ſhall be no other but <hi>God manifeſt in
fleſh:</hi> for every manifeſtation of this power in any
creature,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 22</note> ſhall be ſeen, known, rejoyced in, and
be declared of by man.</p>
               <p>The light, and heat, and Spirit of the Sunne,
ſhall be declared by the Sonne of Righteouſneſſe in
man: The ſweet compliance of love in one creature
towards another; as the clouds to wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the earth to ſend forth the fruits to preſerve the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

by that living power, Love and Righteouſneſſe,
that is ſeated in man towards any creature.</p>
               <p>So that, though this one Almighty power be
ſpread in the whole Creation, yet it will appear to
have his chief reſidence in man,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 23.</note> that in, by and
through man,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 12</note> that one ſpirit may rule and govern
the works of his own hands in Righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Every declaration of Chriſt in the Scriptures, ſhal
be ſeen and known in the clear experience of every
ſonne and daughter (when this myſtery is finiſhed)
for Chriſt, who indeed is the anointing, ſhall fill
all, and all ſhall be the fulneſſe of the anointing:
So that whatſoever a condition a man is in,<note place="margin">Iſa. 21. 13.</note> it is one
or other condition that the childe Jeſus was in,
growing upwards towards man-hood; there is
child hood, youth and old<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>age in the anointing.</p>
               <p>For the wiſdome and power of truth, that was
poured upon the head of the Son of man, grows
upwards towards perfection in ſons and daughters:
Even as wee ſee any tree, corn or cattell, grows up
in the eye of man by degrees; for as theſe creatures
doe not attaine to perfectſon on a ſudden; neither
doth the ſpirit of Righteouſneſſe riſe up on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
perfection, but by degrees</p>
               <p>And therefore, <hi>He that beleeves makes not haſt;</hi> The
haſtie fleſh would have all content on a ſudden,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35008:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but the ſpirit is moderate and riſes up patiently,
its powerfull and quick, and yet ſlow; its ſlow,
but yet ſure; it will ſit down in peace in a man,
though it run thorow many thorns and briars firſt.</p>
               <p>Yea, I ſay, whatſoever condition you are in
Chriſt or the anointing being in you,<note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 3.</note> appears in that
condition in you. If you be in a condition of pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

ſeek to impriſon you and kill you, ſo they dealt
with him, and it is ſtill the righteous man in you
that is oppoſed.</p>
               <p>If you be made to joy in the Father, the Spirit of
truth; it is he within you that rejoyces in himſelf;
if you feel a waiting,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.</note> meek ſpirit in you, it is ſtill
Chriſt in you, <hi>who is meek and lowly.</hi> If you feel
the power of love dwell within you, leading you
to love enimies, and to do as you would be done
unto, it is Chriſt in you, who is the law of love
and Righteouſneſſe,</p>
               <p>And in every condition you are in, this law of

               </p>
               <p>And Chriſt will not ſit down in peace,<note place="margin">Ier. 2. 3. 5, 6</note> rejoycing

outward enemies under his feet, and himſelf become
the alone King of Righteouſneſſe in you; for he is

the ſame report that the Pen-men of Scriptures
gave for the everlaſting Goſpel, <hi>God with us,</hi> or God
<hi>manifeſt in fleſh.</hi> The Father exalted above all, and
in all; for the Prophets and Apoſtles declare theſe
two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Spirit ſpreads himſelf abroad in ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
and types, as in <hi>Moſes</hi> time, and then takes all
into himſelf againe; the Spirit manifeſt in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one
perſon, as in the ſon of man; For all the writings
of old and new Teſtament, are all centered in
Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 7.</note> and are ſwallowed up into him: And this
Chriſt is not only confined to the Lamb Jeſus
anointed, but is the enlarging of the ſame anointing,
in the particular perſons of ſonnes and daughters,
in whom the ſame ſpirit of truth the comforter, is
to be manifeſt in after times.</p>
               <p>And this power ſhall not only fill man-kinde,
and be all in all therein, but all other creatures,
of all kinde according to their ſeverall degrees, ſhall
be filled with this one ſpirit,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 22</note> anointing: As <hi>Pauls</hi>
teſtimony reports, that the whole Creation of all
kindes of creatures, in whom the curſe is ſpread
through mans unrighteouſneſſe, doth all groan and
travell, waiting for the manifeſtation of the ſonnes
of God.</p>
               <p>When man-kinde ſhall be reſtored, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from the curſe, and all ſpirited with this
one power, then other creatures ſhall be reſtored
likewiſe, and freed from their burdens: as the
Earth, from thorns, and briars, and barrenneſſe;
the Air and winds from unſeaſonable ſtorms and
diſtempers; the Cattle from bitterneſſe and rage
one againſt another. And the law of righteouſneſſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35008:17"/>
and love ſhall be ſeated in the whole Creatton,
from the loweſt to the higheſt creature. And this
is the work of reſtoration.</p>
               <p>So that all the glory and content that man takes
in other creatures of the earth, it is but a rejoycing
in himſelf; or that ſpirit that is within him
being more and more filled with peace to ſee, feel,
taſte, ſmell and hear, the power of the whole
Creation, to have a ſweet complyancy of love in
him, and with him.</p>
               <p>For now all jarring, raſhneſſe, violent ſtorms,
barrenneſſe of the earth, corruption in fire and
water, enmity in cattles, oppreſſing principles in
one man over another, are all kept and ſwept away
like locuſts, by this ſtrong Eaſt winde, the Lord
himſelf at his coming. And every creature in his
kinde ſings in Righteouſneſſe, and man lives and
rules in the ſtrength of that Law, by reaſon whereof
all teares and are wiped away. And when this glory

               <p>And then ſecondly, how this ſecond man in the

               <p>The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> kils and crucifies Chriſt in me,

envy over love, luſt before chaſticy, eſteeming
the power of an humble, loving and righteous ſpirit,
towards the pooreſt creatute, but a low and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible

But theſe ten horns are Kingly powers of the fleſh,

him at a diſtance from him, but by ſeeing and feeling
that power, ruling within the body of his fleſh.</p>
               <p>As thus contentedneſſe in all ſtraits or poverty, to
live upon providence, is this ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> in thee,
killing thy diſcontented covetouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Humility and meekneſſe is the ſame anointing
which kils pride and loftines.</p>
               <p>Love to enemies; yea, the law of love flowing
forth to every creature, is Chriſt in you, which kils
envy and raſh anger.</p>
               <p>Chaſtitie in the fleſh, kils uncleanneſſe; wiſdom
that is pure and plain down right, kils a ſubtil over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching

               <p>Sincerity and ſingleneſſe of heart (the ſame anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting)

man would be done unto; and ſo reſpecting the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
preſervation of all creatures, doth kill ſelf-love.</p>
               <p>And all theſe ſeven branchings forth of the pure
ſpirit, makes but one body Chriſt, or one Almighty
power or Mercie and Juſtice, the holy breathing, or
<hi>Emanuel, God in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And every one of theſe ſeven eyes,<note place="margin">Rev. 5. 6.</note> or ſeven attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of the Divine, branches themſelves forth into
ſeveral horns of power, to deſtroy the man of the
fleſh, and to deliver man-kind from his bondage.
For let the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> run out in what ſhape he will;
the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> follows after to trip up his heels;
to ſubdue him, and to take the Kingdom from him;
that ſo, when all enemies are ſubdued, the Almighty
power of righteouſneſſe, which is the Father, may
become all in all.</p>
               <p>And this now declares the meaning of that ſpeech,
<hi>That Chriſt ſaves his people from their ſins;</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in pardoning evil Actions, and removing the evil
of ſorrow from them, but principally to kill and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
the powers of the fleſh, and to make a man ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the ſpirit; and now a man is ſaved from his
ſins, and not till now. And this is to be made a new
creature, in whom old corrupt luſts are paſſed away,
and every power in him is a new power.</p>
               <p>Now there is no man or woman needs go to <hi>Rome,</hi>
nor hell below ground, as ſome talke, to find the
Pope, Devil, Beaſt or Power of darkneſſe; neither
to go up into heaven above the ſkies to find Chriſt
the word of life. For both theſe powers are to be
felt within a man, fighting againſt each other. And
in that ſoul wherein Chriſt prevails, they know that
this is truth, for they find peace hi the ſalvation that
comes out of <hi>Sion.</hi>

               <p>THis firſt man is he,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>by whoſe diſobedience many
are made ſinners,</hi> or by whom the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is corrupred; Therefore you Preachers, do not
you tell the people any more, That a man called
<hi>Adam,</hi> that diſobeyed about 6000 years ago, was the
man that filled every man with ſin and filth, by eating
an apple.</p>
               <p>For aſſure your ſelves, this <hi>Adam</hi> is within every
man and woman; and it is the firſt power that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to act and rule in every man. It is the Lord
<hi>Eſau</hi> that ſtepped before <hi>Iacob,</hi> and got the birth-right,
by the Law of equity was more properly <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though <hi>Iacob,</hi> who is the power and wiſdom that
made fleſh did draw back, and gave way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the
wiſdom and power of fleſh ſhould poſſeſſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and rule firſt; till <hi>Eſau,</hi> by delighting in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
pleaſures, loſt both birth-right and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing;
and left both in the hand of <hi>Iacob</hi> the King,
that rules in righteouſneſſe, that is to riſe up next.</p>
               <p>The Apple that the firſt man eats, is not a ſingle
fruit called an Apple, or ſuch like fruit; but it is the
objects of the Creation; which is the fruit that came
out of the Seed, which is the Spirit himſelf that made
all things: As riches, honours, pleaſures, upon which
the powers of the fleſh feeds to delight himſelf.</p>
               <p>And this is the meſſe of pottage which he prefers
before righteouſneſſe, or before righteous walking in
the Creation towards every creature, which is Chriſt,
that power that appears in the fulneſſe of time to
take the Kingdom and rule next.</p>
               <p>Therefore when a man fals, let him not blame a
man that died 6000 years ago, but blame himſelf,
even the powers of his own fleſh, which lead him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35008:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for this is <hi>Adam</hi> that brings a man to miſery,
which is the man fleſh, or the ſtrong man within that
keeps the houſe, till the man of Righteouſneſſe ariſe
and caſt him out, who is the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this ſecond man is he,<note place="margin">Iſa. 43. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>By whoſe obedience
many are made righteous;</hi> that is, by the power of
Chriſt, man-kind is purged from its droſſe; and this
ſecond man, I ſay, which is the righteous power,
doth caſt the other man (which is the unrighteous
power) out of the houſe, even the heart, and makes
it a temple for himſelf to dwell in.</p>
               <p>Now theſe two powers did the Father ordain
ſhould have their courſe to rule in the earth man-kinde:
And this is that day and night, the light and
darkneſſe, Winter and Summer, heat and cold, Moon
and Sun, that is typed out by the Fabrick of the
great world; for within theſe two powers is the
myſtery of all divine workings wrapped up.</p>
               <p>The firſt power,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 29.</note> that is of darkneſſe, or the Chaos
of confuſion proves ſelfiſh and hurtfull to others,
tearing its own and the orher mans children,
eſpecially to pieces, by cruelty, covetouſneſſe and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion;
<hi>For he that is after the fleſh, perſecutes him
that is born after the ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in the fulneſſe of time;</hi> that is, When the firſt
man hath filled the Creation full of his filthineſſe,
and all places ſtinks with unrighteouſneſſe, as it doth
at this day; then it pleaſeth the Father, that his own

up.<note place="margin">Rev. 19. 2.</note>
               </p>

and power that rules in and over man-kind, and the
fleſh is made ſubject hereunto without grumbling;
and ſo all things becomes the Lords.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And this Son or ſecond</hi> Adam <hi>is called,</hi> The Lord,
The King of righteouſneſſe, The Prince of Peace, The
Saviour, The mighty God, The Reſtorer of all things,
The Salvation, The Conſolation of Iſrael, The Bleſſing
of all Nations of the Earth, The Power of Light or
Reaſon.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee the Father hath ordained,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 7. 2 Theſ. 2. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> that

That ſome men that are cloathed with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

to rule over the poor; and that the poor ſhould be

               <p>But the ſpiritual man, which is Chriſt, doth
judge according to the light of equity and reaſon,
That al man-kinde ought to have a quiet ſubſtance
and freedome, to live upon earth; and that there
ſhal be no bond-man nor begger in all his holy
mountaine.</p>
               <p>Man-kinde was made to live in the freedome of
the ſpirit,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 28.</note> not under the bondage of the fleſh,
though the lordly fleſh hath got a power for a time,
as I ſaid before; for every one was made to be a
Lord over the Creation of the Earth, Cattle, Fiſh,
Fowl, Graſſe, Trees, not any one to be a bond-ſlave
and a beggar under the Creation of his own,
kinde.</p>
               <p>That ſo every one living in freedome and love
in the ſtrength of the Law of Righteouſneſſe in
him; not under ſtraits of poverty, nor bondage
of tyranny one to another, might al rejoyce to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in Righteouſneſſe, and ſo glorifiie their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker;
for ſuerly this much diſhnoured the Maker of

None will be offended at this, but the children

               <p>And when this King raigns, the city that is, the

of humane fleſh perfect in that particular; <hi>Therefore
a man ſhall forſake father and mother, and cleave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

did not make one man and many women, or one

               <p>The whole earth we ſee is corrupt, and it cannot
be purged by the hand of creatures, for all creatures
lies under the curſe, and groans to be delivered, and
the more they ſtrive, the more they entangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the mud; therefore it muſt be the hand of
the Lord alone that muſt do it.</p>
               <p>None can remove the curſe from fire, water, earth

work is called, the Reſtoration of all things; for all
things groan and travel in pain under bondage, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for this manifeſtation.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing every creature that is burdened waits
for the coming in of the bleſſing,<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 18.</note> then ſurely no fleſh
can ſettle this work, for all fleſh is corrupt; this work
ſhall not be done by ſword, or weapon, or wit of the

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:35008:29"/>
But why hath not the Lord done this all this time
that is paſt?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Covetous, wiſe arid lordly fleſh would
raign in the Kingdom, man-kind firſt, and would be
counted the onely power to govern the Creation, in
an excellent order. And the Lord gave this domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
into his hand, bur withall told him, that if he
governed the Creation unrighteouſly, he and all the
Creation ſhould die and fall under the curſe.</p>
               <p>Well, the powers of the flesh, Lord <hi>Eſau</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
and hath ruled with ſuch ſelf-ſeeking ends,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 21 &amp;c.</note>
that he hath made all creatures weary of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the whole earth to ſtink and to groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the burden of it, longing to be delivered.</p>
               <p>For firſt, they that ſtand up to teach others, they
teach for gain, and preach for hire, and fils people
with diviſion and confuſion, through their pride and
envy, and they do this by the Authority of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
power, by which they have ingroſſed the
earth into their hands. A man muſt not take a wife,
but the Prieſt muſt give her him. If he have a child,
the Prieſt muſt give the name. If any die, the Prieſt
muſt ſee it laid in the earth. If any man want know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or comfort, they teach him to go to the Prieſt
for it; and what is the end of all this, but to get
money: if a man labour in the earth to eat his bread,
the Prieſts muſt have the tenths of his encreaſe, or
elſe ſome oppreſſing impropriatour, that shares the
tithes between himſelf and the Prieſt; which Law
was brought in by the Pope, and ſtill upheld by ſuch
as call themſelves, the Chriſtian Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>All which is high treaſon and mighty dishonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Chriſt the great Prophet, whom they ſeem to
ſhew love to; here the earth ſtinks, becauſe this hath
been eſtabliſhed by a compulſive binding power,
whereby the Creation is held under bondage: this
is the fruit of imagination.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:35008:29"/>
Secondly, For matter of buying and ſelling, the
earth ſtinks with ſuch unrighteouſneſſe, that for my
part, though I was bred a tradeſmen, yet it is ſo hard
a thing to pick out a poor living, that a man ſhall
ſooner be cheated of his bread, then get bread by
trading among men, if by plain dealing he put truſt
in any.</p>
               <p>And truly the whole earth of trading, is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
become the neat art of thieving and oppreſſing
fellow-creatures, and ſo laies burdens, upon the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but when the earth becomes a common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury
this burden will be taken off.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, For Juſtices and Officers of State, that
ſhould relieve people in their wrongs, and preſerve
peace, they multiply wrongs, and many, if not moſt
times oppreſſes the poor, and lets the effending rich
go free, by laying aſide the letter of their laws, as
the Prieſts doth the Scriptures; and acts by ſubtil
covetouſneſſe and ſmooth words to get money, or
elſe ruling by their own wills, through envy to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon
and oppreſſe others, letting poor people lie in
priſon half a year many times, and never bring them
to trial at all.</p>
               <p>And thus the people have been and are oppreſſed
by falſe impriſonments and puniſhments; not for
the breach of any known law, but to ſatisfie the will
of the Juſtice, Bailiffs or Officer, againſt all reaſon
and equity, as if the people made Officers to be their
<hi>Aegyrtian</hi> taſk-maſters: Nay, let all men ſpeak open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as they find, and I am ſure they will ſay that the
Juſtices and moſt ſtate Officers, doth more oppreſſe,
then deliver from oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>And thus I ſee that the whole earth ſtinks, by the
firſt <hi>Adams</hi> corrupt Government; therefore it is the
fulneſs of time, for <hi>Jacob</hi> to ariſe, extream neceſſity
cals for the great work of reſtoration, and when

               <p>And now ſeeing there is nothing found but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings
and tears under his oppreſſions, it is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

the Creation, ſhal riſe up and ſpread, and fil the
earth, and all creatures ſhall rejoyce under his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</p>
               <p>Therefore you <hi>Tribes of Iſrael,</hi> that are now in
ſackcloth, every man with his hands upon his
loins, like a woman in travel, ſtand ſtil and ſee
the ſalvation of <hi>David</hi> your King; this is called

                  <note place="margin">Ier. 30. 6</note> for indeed the Spirit

               <p>

Firſt, His kindred and friends endeavoured to

               <p>Wel let the lordly fleſh ſcoffe and laugh and cry,

it is impoſſible,</hi> for it is madneſſe thus to

               <p>For now he Father is raiſſing up a people to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
out of the duſt, and of the ſtones, that is, poor

               <p>I anſwer,<note place="margin">Rev. 11. 8</note> It is true, but not as uſually it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;
for firſt know,<note place="margin">Dan 7. 25 2 Cor. 4. 4</note> That the Spirit is the man
who hath determined to ſuffer himſelf to be killed,

the man of Righteouſneſſe, or ſheds his bloud, for
that ſpace of time, which is indeed the wiſdome
and power of the fleſh, killing the wiſdom and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

               <p>Therefore now it is declared, that the Serpent or

               </p>
               <p>It is not for one creature called man to kill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for this is abominable to the Spirit,<note place="margin">Exe 20. 13</note> and it
is the curſe which hath made the Creation to groan
under bondage; for if I kill you I am a murderrer, if
a third come, and hang or kill me for murdering

the reſurrection: Therefore O thou proud fleſh,
that dares hang and kil thy fellow creatures, that
is equall to thee in the Creation, Know this, that
none hath the power of life and death, but the
Spirit, and al puniſhmens that are to be inflicted
amongſt creatures called men, are only ſuch as to
make the offender to know his maker, and to live
in the community of the righteous Law of love one
with another.</p>
               <p>For talking of love is no love,<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 12</note> it is acting of love
in righteouſneſſe, which the Spirit Reaſon, our
Father delights in. And this is to relieve the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
to let goe the priſoner, to open bags and barns
that the earth may be a common treaſury to preſerve
all without complainings; for uhe earth was not
made for a few to live at eaſe upon, and to kil ſuch
as did not obſerve the Law of their own making,
but it was made for all to live comfortably upon,
and the power of life and death is reſerved in the
hand of the Spirit, not in the hand of fleſh: None
ought to kil, but ſuch as can make alive; therefore
let every one walk righteouſly in the Creation, and
truſt the Spirit for protection.</p>
               <p>He that makes a zealous profeſſion of the Spirit, as
all profeſſours doe, and yet doth not act this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
power of Righteouſneſſe, in labouring the
earth for a common treaſury, is a meer ſelf-lover,
and he profeſſes but himſelf, and is a complementing
enemy to Reaſon the King of Righteouſneſſe: and
if ſtil thou ſaiſt, it is the Spirit, whom thou doeſt
worſhip, then make it manifeſt to the world, what
ſpirit this is that rules every where beſids Reaſon.</p>

                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:35008:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And futher he that denies this community,<note place="margin">Act. 4. 32</note> denies
the Scriptures Likewiſe, whether the Preachers,
proſeſſours, or rich men, that upholds this unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

               <p>Therefore you duſt of the earth, that are trod un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>If you labour the earth, and work for others that

               <p>This voice of the Lord, work together and eat

covetous, proud fleſh that dies. If any man can
ſay that he makes Corn or Cattle, he may ſay, That
is mine: But if the Lord make theſe for the uſe of
his Creation, ſuerly then the earth was made by the
Lord, to be a common Treaſury for all, not a
particular Treaſury for ſome.</p>
               <p>If any man can ſay, he can give life, then he hath
power to take away life: But if the power of life
and death be only in the hand of the Lord; then
ſurely he is a murderer of the Creation,<note place="margin">Ex. 20. 13</note> that takes

               <p>But what if ſome ſteal or whore, or become idle,
and wil not work, but live upon others labours, as
rich men do, that cal the land theirs?</p>
               <p>I anſwer; If any manifeſt ſuch a Achaniſh or

al this time, that every ones eie may be upon him,
as upon a fool in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> he ſhal be a ſervant to every

               <p>If any do ſteal, what wil they do with it? None
ſhal buy or ſel, and al the while that every one ſhal
have meat, and drink, and cloaths, what need have
they to ſteal? Their ſtealing ſhal get them nothing,
but to loſe the benefit of Sonſhip; And that is to
be ſet alone, to eat his own bread, none having
communion with him.</p>
               <p>For every one ſhal know the Law, and every one,
ſhal obey the Law; for it ſhal be writ in every ones
heart; and every one that is ſubject to Reaſons law,
ſhal enjoy the benefit of Sonſhip.<note place="margin">Act. 4. 32</note> And that is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

propriety of mine and thine; which is the

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:35008:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſlain by covetous, proud fleſh; this 1649 years ago:
But now that ſpirit begins to ariſe againe from the
dead, and the ſame Beaſt ſeeks to hinder his riſing;
or elſe watches to kil the Manchild after he is

               <p>Look upon the mountaines and little hils of the
earth, and ſee if theſe prickling thorns and briars,
the bitter curſe does, not grow there: Truly Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
is Tyrannie in one as wel as in another; in a
poor man lifted up by his valour, as in a rich man
lifted up by his lands: And where Tyrannie ſits,
he is an enemy to Chriſt, the ſpreading ſpirit of
righteouſneſſe: He wil uſe the bare name, Chriſt,
that he may the more ſecretly perſecute, and kil his
power.</p>
               <p>Tyrannie is a ſubtile, proud and envious Beaſt;
his nature is ſelfiſh, and ful of murder; he promiſes
fair things for the publique; but all muſt be made
to center within ſelf, or ſelf intereſt not the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
libertie.</p>
               <p>Wel, to be ſhort, Let every one know, if they
wait upon their Maker they wil know, That the
univerſal power of righteous Communitie, as I have
declared, is <hi>Canaan,</hi> the land of reſt and libertie,
which flows with milk and honey,<note place="margin">Zach. 8. 3. to 12.</note> with abundance
of joy and peace in our Maker, and one in another.</p>
               <p>But the condition of the world, that upholds ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
intereſts of mine and thine: Is <hi>Egypt</hi> the houſe
of bondage; and truly <hi>Pharoahs</hi> taſk-maſters are
very many, both Teachers and Rulers.</p>
               <p>Therefore thus ſaid the voyce of the ſpirit in me,
guiding my eie to the powers of the earth three
times, Let Iſrael go free: Let Iſrael go free: Let
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:35008:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Iſrael go free: Work all together, Eat bread alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
Whoſoever labours the earth for any one,
that wil be a burdning Ruler over others, and does
not look upon himſelf as equal to others in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the hand of the Lord ſhal be upon that
labourer: I the Lord have ſpoken it, and I wil doe
it: Declare this all abroad, Iſrael ſhal neither give
hire, nor take hire.</p>
               <p>Surely this is both ful of reaſon and equity; for
the earth was not made for ſome, but for al to live
comfortably upon the fruits of it: And there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

               <p>All tears, occaſioned through bondage, cannot be

But indeed as yet, as the ſtate of the world is
while the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> yet ſits in the Chair, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts
the Creation by his unrighteous wiſdome and
power; I ſay at this time, the feirce wrath of the
King of Righteouſneſſe is threatned over this Land
called <hi>England,</hi> and indeed over all the whole earth,
where particular intereſt bears rule, and enſlaves the
Creation.</p>
               <p>And if covetous, proud fleſh ſtil uphold this
ſelf-propriety, which is the curſe aud burden which
the Creation groans under: Then O thou covetous
earth, expect the multyplying of plagues, and the
fulfilling of all threatning propheſies and viſions for
thy downfal in miſerie.</p>
               <p>But if thou wouldſt find mercie, then open thy
barns and treaſuries of the earth, which thou haſt
heaped together, and detains from the poor, thy
fellow creatures: This is the only remedy to eſcape
wrath: and the door of acceptance to mercie is yet
open, if thou do this: The Judge of Truth and
Right waits yet upon thy comming into him.</p>
               <p>Therefore, O thou firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> take notice, that
the Lord hath ſet before thee life and death, now
chuſe whether thou wilt, for the time is near at hand
that buying and ſelling of land ſhall ceaſe, and every
ſon of the land ſhal live of it.</p>
               <p>Divide <hi>England</hi> into three parts, ſcarce one part
is manured: So that here is land enough to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
all her children, and many die for want, or
live under a heavy burden of povertie all their daies:
And this miſerie the poor people have brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themſelves, by lifting up particular intereſt, by
their labours.</p>
               <p>There are yet three doors of hope for <hi>England</hi> to
eſcape deſtroying plagues:</p>
               <p>Firſt, let every one leave off running after o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
for knowledge and comfort, and wait upon
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:35008:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ſpirit Reaſon, til he break forth out of the
Clouds of your heart,<note place="margin">Luke 24. 49.</note> and manifeſt himſelf within
you. This is to caſt off the ſhadow of Learning, and
to reject covetous, ſubtile proud fleſh that deceives
all the world by their hearſay, and traditional
preaching of words,<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 14.</note> letters and ſillables, without
the ſpirit: And to make choyce of the Lord, the
true Teacher of every one in their own inward expe,
rience, The myſterie of the ſpirit, and the myſtrie
of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Let every one open his bags and barns,
that al may feed upon the crops of the earth, that
the burden of povertie may be removed: Leave of
this buying and ſelling of Land,<note place="margin">Act. 4. 32.</note> or of the fruits of
the earth; and as it was in the light of Reaſon firſt
made, ſo let it be in action, amongſt all a common
Treaſurie; none incloſing or hedging in any part of
earth, ſaying, this is mine; which is rebellion and
high treaſon againſt the King of Righteouſneſſe:
And let this word of the Lord be acted amongſt all;
work together, eat bread together.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. Leave off dominion and Lordſhip one
over another, for the whole bulk of man-kinde are
but one living earth. Leave off impriſoning, whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and killing; which are but the actings of the
curſe: And let thoſe that hitherto have had no Land
and have been forced to rob and ſteal through po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie;
hearafter let them quietly enjoy Land to
work upon, that every one may enjoy the benefit of
his Creation, and eat his own bread with the ſweat
of his own brows: For ſurely this particular propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of mine and thine, hath brought in all miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
upon people. For firſt, it hath occaſioned people
to ſteal one from another. Secondly, it hath made
Laws to hang thoſe that did ſteal: It tempts peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to doe an evil action, and then kils them or
doing of it: Let all judge if this be not a great devil.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:35008:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Well: If every one would ſpeedily ſet about the
doing of theſe three particulars I have mentioned,
the Creation would thereby be lift up out of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
and our Maker would have the glory of the
works of his own hands.</p>
               <p>They that offer themſelves, and what treaſure
they have,<note place="margin">1. P. 5. 3. <hi>Iudge.</hi> 5. 2. 9.</note> freely, to further this work, ſhal find
mercy, and the bleſſing of all Nations ſhal be his
Comfortor: They that hinder this common intereſt
of earthly community, and wil keep up the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
government of old Adam ſtil, the hand of the
Lord ſhal be upon that perſon, whoſoever he be.</p>
               <p>Thus ſaith the Lord to all the great ones, that
are cloathed with objects, and are lifted up fleſh
with honours in the government of the world: Let
Iſrael go quietly out of your bondage that they may
ſerve me; If you wil not let him go, I wil not
come with 10 plagues, as upon Egyptian Pharoah of
old, but I wil multiply my plagues upon thee, thou
ſtout-hearted Pharoah, that makes ſhew of love to
me, and yet all is but like Jehu, to lift up thy ſelf
over the remnant in the Land.</p>
               <p>Adam is the commer in of bondage, and is the
curſe that hath taken hold of the Creation: And he
may wel be called A-dam, for indeed he does dam
and ſtop up the ſtreams of the waters of life and
libertie.</p>
               <p>When ſlaverie began to creep in upon the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the Spirit might wel cry out in Lamentation,
Ah-dam, A-dam, which draws together; a head
of corrupted waters, of covetous, proud and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
fleſh, to ſtop the ſtreams of the waters of life
and libertie.</p>
               <p>But ſaith the Spirit our Maker, The ſeed from

               <p>This A-dam ſtops up the waters or Life and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

Chriſt Jeſus, in whom the ſeed ruled in power) but
they were bound up in bondage to coveteouſneſſe,
pride, imagination, and to all the powers of the
fleſh: So that the free running ſtreams of the Spirit
of life were ſtopped, that they could not run; which
hath made every one cry, O wretched man that I
am, who ſhal deliver me from this body of ſin or

               <p>Secondly, this A-dam, being the power of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

proud fleſh, he ſets up one part of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
man, to rule over another, and makes Laws
to kil and hang thal part of the Creation, that wil
not ſubmit to the ruling part And ſo he is become a
God, ruling in the ſpirits own houſe, not preſerving

by the ears, to k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l it ſelf, to the mighty diſhonour
of our Maker: Therefore when the people would
have <hi>Saul</hi> to rule them; the Spirit declared, that
that outward ruling power was the curſe; and he
ſet him up in his wrath to be a ſcourge, not a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
               <p>Now whereas the Creation, man, ſhould live in
equalitie one towards another; this A-dam hath
lifted up mountaines and hils of oppreſſing powers,
and there by that, dammed and ſtopped up that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
communitie: Therefore at the firſt riſing up
of this ſerpentine power to enſlave the Creation, he
might wel be declared by way of Lamenattion, A-dam
Adam.</p>

                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:35008:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Covetouſneſſe, or ſelf-love; is the dam; the
letter A: before, declares, that he is a preparer to
miſerie, and is delivered by way of Lamentation,
Ah: or A-dam.</p>
               <p>Dovetouſneſſe, or ſelf-love, is the man of ſin,
that appears firſt. The imagination ariſing from that
couetous power is the woman, or Eve, which like
the Ivie, clings about the tree; and ſo covetouſneſſe
and imagination, does beget between them a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
joy, pleaſure and delight; but it proves a
lie.</p>
               <p>Theſe two, Covetouſneſſe and Imagination, the
man and the woman of ſin, or A-dam, and his Eve,
or Ivie, does beget fruit or children, like both Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

crueltie, and all unclean luſts pleaſing the fleſh. And
now the dam-head is made up ſtrong, to ſtop the
ſtreams of waters of life and univerſal libertie: But
in the fulneſſe of time, the Spirit wil break down
this dam-head againe, and cauſe the waters of the
Spirit of life to flow again plentifully.</p>
               <p>And herein you may ſee, how the publique
Preachers have cheated the whole world, by telling
us of a ſingle man, called Adam, that kiled us al by
eating a ſingle fruit, called an Apple.</p>
               <p>Alas, this Adam is the dam that hath ſtopped up the

while he rules, a man can have no community with
the ſpirit within himſelf, nor community of love
with fellow creatures, he does ſo puff them up with
covetouſneſſe, and pride, and deſire of Lordly rule
one over another.</p>
               <p>Do but look into every mean and woman, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>I, but now the 42 months are expiring, we are
under the half day of the Beaſt, or the dividing of
time, and Chriſt, or the two Witneſſes, are ariſing
and ſpreading himſelf again in the earth: And when
he hath ſpread himſelf abroad amongſt his Sons and
daughters, the members of his myſtical body, then
this community of love and righteouſneſſe,
making all to uſe the bleſſings of the earth as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Treaſurie amongſt them, ſhal break forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain

more ſuppreſt: And none ſhal ſay, this is mine,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:35008:41"/>
but every one ſhal preſerve each other in love.</p>
               <p>As Chriſt does thus riſe and ſpread, thoſe that
have riches, gold and ſilver, and the like, and are
taken into the oneneſſe of this Spirit, they ſhall
come, and offer up their treaſures willingly, not
daring to keep it:<note place="margin">Exo. 25. 2.</note> That thoſe that have nothing
may have part,<note place="margin">Ezra 7. 16</note> and enjoy the bleſſing of the earth
with themſelves,<note place="margin">Mat. 2. 11</note> being all members of that one
body, unto whom the Kings of the Eaſt, called the
Wiſe men, offered gifts, gold frankinſenſe and
myrrhe while he was the Child Jeſus.</p>
               <p>But thoſe that do not come in and offer what
they have, willingly, to the work of the Lord, they
ſhal be ſtripped naked of all, and ſhal either be
deſtroyed by the blagues that ſhal come upon the
earth; or at beſt if their lives be given them, they
ſhal be ſervants, and not enjoy the benefit of Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
til the Spirit of the Son riſe up in them, and
make them free.</p>
               <p>So that this work is not done by wars councels,<note place="margin">Ioh 8. 32</note>
or hands of men, for I abhor it; though by thoſe
the government of Eſau ſhal be beaten down,<note place="margin">Dan. 8. 25</note> and
the enemy ſhal deſtroy one another.</p>
               <p>But the Lord alone wil be the healer, the reſtorer,
&amp; the giver of the new law of righteouſnes, by ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf every where and ſo drawing al things up
into himſelf.</p>
               <p>And the declaration of this law of righteouſneſſe
ſhal riſe out of the duſt, out of the poor people
that are trod under foot: For, as the declaration of
the Son of man was firſt declared by Fiſher-men,
&amp; men that the learned, covetous Scholars deſpiſed:
ſo the declaration of the righteous law ſhal ſpring
up from the poor, the baſe and deſpiſed ones, and
fools of the world; and humane learning, and ſuch
as love the oppreſſion of exacting Tyths, ſhal not be
honoured in his buſineſſe: For they that ſtand up

him for teaching, and to acknowledge no other
teacher and ruler but himſelf: but theſe men wil
have al people to look for knowledge to come

               <p>But now he that ſpeaks from imagination, or from

which kils or ſurpreſſes <hi>Abel,</hi> who is the anointing;

age, wherein every branch of man-kinde is put
to his choice, whether he wil follow the Law of
Righteouſneſſe, according to the Creation, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Or whether he wil delight ſelf, in glorying in
the objects of the earth unrighteouſly. Now if he
chuſe to ſatisfie his luſts and his ſelf-wil, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
Reaſons Law, he ſhal fal downwards into
bondage, and lie under the powers of darkneſſe,
and live no higher then within the circle of dark
fleſh, that hath no peace within it ſelf, but what
he fetches from creatures without him.</p>
               <p>But if he chuſe the way of Righteouſneſſe, and
follow the light of Reaſons Law, then he ſhal
partake of reſt, peace and libertie of the Spirit, as
if there were no creature objects at all; for he
that hath peace within, <hi>uſes the world as though he
uſed it not,</hi> and hath content and joy, though
he have no creature to have communion with.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing that the man of the fleſh wil and
muſt appear to rule in the Kingdome of man-kinde
firſt; <hi>All men are gone aſtray, and all fleſh have corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their waies,</hi> and the curſe is ſpread abroad thorow
the Creation: And therefore the whole Creation
wait for a Reſtoration, or for the riſing up of Chriſt
the ſecond man, the bleſſing, who muſt bruiſe the
head of bondage, and reconcile al men to peace and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:35008:46"/>
liberty.<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 18.</note> And as the curſe is ſeen and felt within, ſo
the bleſſing of freedom and life, muſt riſe up, and
be ſeen and felt within.</p>
               <p>Therefore let not your blind guides deceive you
any longer; Doe not look beyond your ſelves to
<hi>Adam,</hi> a man that died 6000 years agoe, though they
bid you; but look upon <hi>Adam</hi> within your-ſelf,
who hath wrought your woe. And for the time to
come, wait upon the riſing of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the
Law of Righteouſneſſe within you, to deliver you
from the bondage of the firſt power.</p>
               <p>And here you may ſee the deceit of imagination
and fleſhly wiſdom and learning; it teaches you to
look altogether upon a hiſtory without you, of things
that were done 6000 years agoe, and of things that
were done 1649 years agoe, of the carriage of the
<hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> then againſt the ſon of man.</p>
               <p>And ſo carrying you firſt to one age of the world,
then to another age of the world, travelling Sea
and Land to find reſt; and the more that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
learning and his profeſſours travels abroad,
the further off from reſt they are, for they meet with
nothing but confuſion and ſtarits, and no true peace:
And why?</p>
               <p>Becauſe that which a man ſeeks for, whereby he
might have peace, is within the heart, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.
The word of life, Chriſt the reſtoring ſpirit, is to
be found within you, even in your mouth, and in
your heart: <hi>The Kingdome of heaven</hi> (which is) Chriſt
<hi>is within you,</hi> and diſobedient <hi>Adam</hi> is within you;
for this is <hi>Eſau</hi> that ſtrives with <hi>Jacob</hi> in the womb

               <p>And this let me tel you,<note place="margin">Iſa 32. 9. to 16.</note> and you ſhal find it true,
Goe read all the books in your Univerſitie, that

till your eyes return into your ſelves, and the

               <p>Wherein you ſhall find the <hi>myſtery of iniquity,
The man of ſinne,</hi> that firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> that made you a

<hi>Adam</hi> Chriſt, who, when he ariſes up therein, he
makes you righteous and reſtores you again to life.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, that many a poor deſpiſed man

to buy and ſell them, but caſts out their names

true experience of the Father, and walks more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly
in the Creation, in ſpirit and truth,
then thoſe that cal themſelves teachers and zealous
Profeſſours.</p>
               <p>And why? Becauſe theſe ſingle hearted ones are
made to look into themſelves, wherein they can
read the work of the whole Creation, and ſee that
Hiſtory ſeated within themſelves; they can ſee
the myſtery of Righteouſneſſe, and are acquainted
every one according to his meaſure, with that ſpirit
of truth that is to be <hi>the bleſſing of the whole earth,</hi>
and that enlightens al that come into the world;
theſe are the duſt and ſtones ſo the earth, that

man regards, ſhal the Deliverer come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now thoſe that are called Preachers, and great
profeſſours that runs a hearing, ſeeks for knowledge
abroad in Sermons, in books and Uuniverſities, and
buyes it for money, as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would have
done, and than delivers it out again for money,
for a 100 l. or 200 l. a year. And thoſe men that ſpeak
from an inward teſtimony of what they have ſeen

what not, as the language of Pulpits runs, but the
Lord wil whip ſuch traders out of his Temple.</p>
               <p>And truly the whole world wanders after the
Beaſt, and though the people many of them, doe
ſee that their Prheachers are blinde guides, bitter
ſpirited: proud and covetous, yet they are aſhamed
and afraid to diſown them, O great bondage under
the devils.</p>
               <p>And hence it is that they think they are wiſe and
learned, and the only men ſent of God to preach
the Goſpel, til the power of Righteouſneſſe come
and declare before all the world, that they are
enemies to the Goſpel, and knows him not, for
the anointing is the glad tidings, which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
within the heart, not a diſtance from men.</p>
               <p>And ſo Chriſt takes theſe wiſe and learned in their

to be very ſilly men, the moſt ignorant of all, blinde

therefore I ſhall deliver what I have received con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this.</p>
               <p>Firſt know, that there is mention of three Gods
in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>1. The Magiſtrate, <hi>I ſaid ye are gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>The Devil,</hi> The god of this world hath blinded
your eyes.</p>
               <p>3. The King of Righteouſneſſe is called God, <hi>The
Lord God omnipotent reigns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Magiſtracie is ruling power, called God,
by their righteous Government a Kingdom may be
kept in peace, but by their unrighteous Government,
they trouble every body, and the people may ſay,
Thou, O our God, haſt deſtroyed us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The devil or the powers of the fleſh in
every man and woman is a ruling power, called god,
that brings miſery to every body, and corrupts the
whole Creation, fire, water, earth and air.</p>
               <p>1. By drawing the Creature into unreaſonable
wayes: which wayes and works.</p>
               <p>2. Becomes the creatures own tormentours, when
by the light of the Sun of Righteouſneſſe, man is
made to ſee himſelf; for all mens ſorrows are but
the riſings up of their own works againſt themſelves.
Therefore people may ſay to the devil, or their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
fleſh. O thou, our God, thou haſt deſtroyed
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, thou haſt deceived us, O god, thou promiſedſt
peace, and afterwards writeſt bitter things againſt us.
Our own works are our tormenting devils.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:35008:51"/>
Then thirdly, The King of Righteouſneſſe is the
ruling power, called God; but he is not the Authour
of the creatures miſery, for his dealing with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
fleſh, is two-fold, which is the righteous
Juſtice and Judgement of the King.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſuffers man to take his own courſe and to
act his own will, and to follow his own l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſts, letting
him alone, and permitting him a time to do what he
will, for wiſe, proud and covetous fleſh thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be a god, or an Angel of light, and that his
wiſdom and power is the onely power. And now if
the righteous King ſhould not give him this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
he would ſay he had wrong done him, therefore
Reaſon lets him have his will to act his principles,
that when the time comes that he ſhall be made to
ſee himſelf and his works, he may be left without
excuſe.</p>
               <p>This declares the Almighty power of patience,
love and meekneſs in the King towards his creature,
that he can ſuffer himſelf to be a ſervant to that
curſed power in the fleſh to this end, that he may
take that fleſhly wiſdom in his craft, deſtroy that
curſe, and ſave his creature, man, from that bondage;
That after that man hath had trial of his own wiſdom
and power of his fleſh and finds it a devil, and that
there is no bleſſing in it; he may then come to lie
down in the wiſdom and power of the King of
Righteouſneſſe in reſt and peace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the ſolneſſe of time; that is, when all
fleſh hath corrupted his wayes; then the King or
Sun of Righteouſneſſe ariſes up, and lets man in his
light to ſee himſelf to be a devil. The King layes no
hand upon him, but lets him ſee himſelf; and the
mans own works become the devils that torment
him. If a man have ſore eyes, and look in the Sun,
his eyes ſmart; now that ſmart comes not from the
Sun, but the venome of the eyes riſes up &amp; torments
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:35008:51"/>
it ſelf, when the Sun cauſe it to ſee or feel it ſelf.</p>
               <p>This declares the wiſdom, power, Juſtice and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the King, that when he riſes he can make
fleſh to ſee it ſelf, and needs do no more, but ſhine
forth and burn in his brightneſſe, by whom that curſe
or droſſe in the fleſh is conſumed and cannot ſtand;
therefore if fleſh were righteous it would ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the righteous Law; but ſeeing it cannot ſtand,
it appears unrighteous, to be a devil and no Angel
of light. And this method of the Father brings glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his own name, that he alone is the one almighty
power and wiſdom.</p>
               <p>This is Juſtice in the righteous Judge, and ſhews,
him to be the pure Law, and fleſh kils and torments
it ſelf.</p>
               <p>I but when the waters drowned the world, and
the fire burned <hi>Sodom,</hi> this was a Judgement more
then letting fleſh ſee his own unrighteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, The overflowings of the water in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to drown, and the breakings forth of the fire in
that manner to burn waſte and conſume, were the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
up of the curſe that was in the water and fire,
to deſtroy the unrighteous fleſh of man, that cauſed
it.</p>
               <p>For when the Father made the Creation, he made
all Elements to uphold one another in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and one creature to preſerve another; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was all very good. But this riſing up of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to deſtroy one another, is the curſe; which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
man, that is, the Lord of the creatures hath
brought upon the Creation.</p>
               <p>I but how comes the fire and water to break forth
to deſtroy at ſome times more then another?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, When the fulneſſe of time comes, that
earth begins to ſtink with the abominations of man,
then the Father ariſes up and ſhews himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Creation of fire, water, earth and air. And
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:35008:52"/>
the curſe that is brought upon this by man cannot
abide the preſence of the Lord, but riſes up and runs
together into a head to oppoſe the Lord; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it deſtroyes man that was the cauſe of it. So
that the riſings up of waters, and the breakings forth
of fire to waſte and deſtroy, are but that curſe, or the
works of mans own hands, that riſe up and run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
to deſtroy their Maker, and torment him that
brought the curſe ſorth.</p>
               <p>While water and fire are uſeful, the bleſſing of the
Creation lies in them, and comes from them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Creation for the glory of the Maker.</p>
               <p>But when they break forth to waſte and deſtroy,
this is the curſe, the burden of the Creation, that
breaks forth to deſtroy unrighteous man that cauſed
it.</p>
               <p>And it doth break forth when the Lord appears
in the Creation; as I ſaid, when the Sun ſhines the
venome in ſore eyes riſes up and ſmarts: So when
righteous power begins to move in the fire, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the water, the curſe that is in theſe Elements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes
up and diſturbs the Creation, to the deſtruction
of man whoſe work it is.</p>
               <p>I but one man kils another by wars, and ſuch like,
Is not this the wrath of God upon them?</p>
               <p>I anſwer in the ſame manner as I did before; for
as the curſed fleſh in one body torments it ſelf, when
he ſees himſelf a devil.</p>
               <p>So multitudes of bodies of men, are ſtill but one
fleſh, or one earth: And when the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
begins to ſhine into this earth, the veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
parts riſe up to kill and deſtroy light, but in
the end the fleſh deſtroyes it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Let the power of humility and Righteouſneſſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to a proud, unrighteous, covetous man, and
ſhew him his evil, as in theſe dayes it doth, he ſwels
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:35008:52"/>
preſently, and riſes up to make war to maintain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be an Angel of light; and pride being
diſperſed into divers bodies, cannot yield one
to another, to preſerve one another, but riſe up to
deſtroy each other in the light of the Sun: The Sun
ſhines, and the dunghill caſts up his ſtinking ſmell:
The Lord he ſhines, and proud fleſh kils one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
fleſh kils but it ſelf.</p>
               <p>And truly I muſt tell you, That all theſe wars, and
killing one another, are but the riſing up of the curſe:
deſtroying Armies of men, are but the curſe, the
burden which the Creation groans under: For in the
beginning, all was very good, and the Creation at
firſt was made to preſerve it ſelf; and this riſing up
to deſtroy the Creation, is the curſe.</p>
               <p>And the Spirit of the Father, that dwels in any
humane body that is killed, doth run into the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
of life, and purifies the Creation from the curſe.</p>
               <p>But did not God ſend the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Sabeans</hi>
to puniſh <hi>Job?</hi> Yes, the god Devil did; but not
the God or Righteouſneſſe: For the Devil deſired a
libertie to try <hi>Iob,</hi> and the righteous power, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
gave him leave; onely told him, he ſhould not
touch his life; and then the Devil ſends theſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and burns his houſe, and kils his children;
give but libertie to the curſe, and he doth much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
               <p>Who was it that the god Devil did afflict? Not
an enemy to the King of Righteouſneſſe, but a body
in whom he dwelt: Yea, the Father did but ſuffer
himſelf to be perſecuted by the Devil, in that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
body <hi>Iob:</hi> That at laſt, that power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which is the Accuſer of the Brethren, and the
bondage of the Creation, might be made manifeſt in
the light of the Sun, and ſo be caſt out juſtly.</p>
               <p>Now the end of all is this, that unrighteous fleſh
that thinks himſelf an Angel of light, and the onely
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:35008:53"/>
power, may be proved to be a Devil, and ſo be caſt
out of the Creation and periſh: That Jacob, the
King of Righteouſneſſe, the bleſſing of peace, might
ariſe up and reign for ever in the Creation, when all
enemies are ſubdued under his ſeet.</p>
               <p>There is a time appointed of the righteous Judge,
that all fleſh ſhall ſee it ſelf in its own colours; and
when the fleſh doth ſee it ſelf in his own beaſtly
ſhapes, he will appear ſo deformed, ſo piteous a
confuſed Chaos of miſerie and ſhame, that the ſight
thereof ſhall be a great torment to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Therefore take notice of this, you proud, envious,
covetous, bitter-ſpirited, and unrighteous men and
women; this ſelf-ſatisfying glory in which you live,
and ſeem to have reſt, ſhall become your hell-tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when you are made to ſee your unrighteous,
treacherous ſelf, as you muſt when the Judge ſits up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>You that are now aſhamed to own the righteous

               <p>Wel, what a man ſees or hears to day, may be gone
to morrow; all outward glory that is at a diſtance
from the five ſenſes, and taken in by a repreſentation,
is of a tranſient nature; and ſo is the Heaven that
your Preachers tell you of.</p>
               <p>But when the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> riſes up in the heart,
he makes a man to ſee Heaven within himſelf, and
to judge all things that are below him: He makes
many bodies to be the declarers of him, who is the
one power of righteouſneſſe that rules therein: And
this is Heaven that will not fail us, endurable riches,
treaſures that ſhall not wax old, and where moth and
ruſt cannot corrupt, nor thieves break through and
ſteal: This Chriſt is within you, your everlaſting reſt
and glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:35008:56"/>
And as the man of the fleſh fetches in comforts
from without, ſeeking content in and from Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and Creature-objects; ſo he envies every one
that croſſes his deſires; croſſe him in his pride, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe
and uncleanneſſe, and he grows extream
angry at every body; tell him that his formall and
cuſtomary preaching and praying, is but ſelf-ſeeking,
not ſetting up the Lord, and he is filled with rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe that tel him ſo.</p>
               <p>But he never looks within to check himſelf, he
takes no remedy there at all, and lets thoſe Devils lie
quiet within; and if any be ſent, I ſay, from the
Lord, to diſturb thoſe his luſts, he will diſturb that
meſſenger, if he can; but he will cheriſh himſelf
within: He thinks that whatſoever he doth is good,
and that whatſoever croſſes that power that is in his
heart, doth croſſe the Lord.</p>
               <p>But truly it is no other but the Serpents power,
which muſt be deſtroyed; he fetches in content from
the Creatures that are without him; and his envy
and diſcontent runs after things and Creatures that
are without, which croſſes his fleſhly deſires.</p>
               <p>But now the man of righteouſneſſe, Chriſt, when
he riſes up in the heart, he loves all that are without
him; and he envies none but the Serpent within,
which troubles the Creation; and ſo is quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to the other.</p>
               <p>For as ſoon as Chriſt is roſe up in a man, the firſt
thing he doth, he takes, revenge of the pride, luſt,
envy, covetouſneſſe, which ruled within the fleſh,
and caſts that Serpent and Dragon out of Heaven:
That is, out of that part of the Creation; and makes
a man to cry out upon himſelf, and to hate and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
his curſed luſts, which lead him captive.</p>
               <p>He makes a man to look abroad with the eie of
pitty and compaſſion to fellow-Creatures; but to
look with the eie of hatred and loathing upon the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:35008:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Serpent, his unclean luſts, deſiring nothing ſo much
as the death of the body of ſin within.<note place="margin">Zach 4. 7</note> So that the
law of righteouſneſſe may reigne in peace in his ſoul:
O thou curſed envy, curſed raſh anger, curſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe:
O curſed Devil, curſed Father of lies,
that will not ſuffer Chriſt to riſe up and reign: O
thou enemy of all rightouſneſſe, thou wicked one,
thou curſe, thou power of darkneſſe, thou fleſhly
power, thou ſhalt be deſtroyed and ſubdued under
Chriſt's feet, whom thou fighteſt againſt.</p>
               <p>The greateſt combate is within a man, when the
King ſits upon the Throne, judging unrighteous fleſh,
and bruiſing that Serpents head, And though this
be trouble and torment for a time to the Creature,<note place="margin">Rev. 4. 2.</note>
yet Chriſt at laſt will ſit down in him, who is Prince
of peace, and King of righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>The created fleſh of man is the Beaſt, the King of
Beaſts; the ſame principles as are in other Creatures,
are in humane fleſh: The difference between man
and other beaſts, is this, The fleſh of man is made
an underſtanding Soul, capable to know Reaſon, and
to walk in his light: Other beaſts cannot.</p>
               <p>Now the wiſe fleſh is meerly ſelfiſh, he ſeeks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in every thing he doth, and would be a Lord and
Ruler, not only over the Beaſts of the field, but
over creatures of his own kind, whom his Maker
made equall to himſelf; and ſo ſtrives to fetch in all
other Creatures, to advance his content, though it
be to the loſſe and miſery of other men.</p>
               <p>This is the Beaſt, Lord <hi>Eſau,</hi> the wiſe and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,
ſelf-ſeeking fleſh, that hath ſold his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
and bleſſing to <hi>Jacob,</hi> for the pleaſure of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe
a ſmall time: And now he muſt be
turned out, and deliver all up to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and he is
extreamly vext, and will not yield quier poſſeſſion,
but ſtand out ſtifly, till he be caſt out, by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall
power of Reaſons law.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:35008:57"/>
Now the rule and dominion of Jacob doth not
bring loſſe and miſery to any;<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 18.</note> his law is ſo eſtabliſhed
in love, that the whole Creation finds peace under it,
ſorrow and tears, beggary and oppreſſion ſhall be
done away, and the bleſſing of the Lord Jacob ſhall
fill the earth.</p>
               <p>So then we ſee,<note place="margin">Rev. 19. 19.</note> that the great battell of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
is between thi ſelfiſh power, the Beaſt and
fleſhy man; and the univerſall power, Chiriſt, the man
of righteouſneſſe; for the fleſh would be wiſer then
its Maker: for though his Maker would have the
whole Creation, and every creature to enjoy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of their Creation, and no live free from ſtraits
comfortably: Yet the wiſe and converous fleſh ſeeks
to live free in honour and quiet in himſelf, &amp; makes
laws to impriſon, kill and waſte every one, that will
not conforme to his ſelfiſh Government.</p>
               <p>Now the Father wil deſtroy the Beaſt in the open
field by fair play, and hath given him all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
as may be; for he hath given the Beaſt the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominion,
and himſelf is a Servant under his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
and will undermine the wiſe and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Beaſt, by righteons ſuſterings, and action as a
Servant: And the Father encounters with the Beaſt
or Dragon, in a three-fold poſture of war.</p>
               <p>As Firſt, by the Sacrifices under the Law, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
thereby declared the deſtruction of the Beaſt;
and the Spirit lay hid under thoſe types and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
fighting againſt the Beaſt; and the wiſe
fleſh in thoſe daies ſought againſt his Maker; This
is a diſtance of Cannon ſhot.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the priſon of Jeſus Chriſt, the Lamb,
the Father fought againſt the Beaſt: and killed him;
for the Dragon was caſt out of that Heaven or Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in whom the Father dwelt bodily; for that fleſh
was wholly made ſubject to the Spitit; this was at
a cloſer diſtance cloſing in the Front: But
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:35008:57"/>
the wiſe fleſh hath many ſtrong holds, even the
multitudes of men and women, which he fortifies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Spirit.</p>
               <p>And therefore in the third poſture, which is
now begun, the Father encounters, and wil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with the Beaſt every where: that is, with
the wiſe but covetous, unrighteous fleſh, in every
ſon and daughter, and ſo bruiſe that Serpents head
in the whole body of his Army.</p>
               <p>And before he hath done, he wil fire all the
ſtrong-holds of this murder, ſo that he ſhall not
have a place to keep garriſon in; for the Father
will ſubdue the whole bulk of man-kind, and make
all that living earth ſubject to him ſelf, and all with
holy breathing: This is the ſpreading of the Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
This is the glory of the Elect One; glorious
things are ſpoken of thee, O though City of God.</p>
               <p>This holy breathing is the Kingdom of Heaven
within you, when he rules within you, and the
Kingdom of Heaven without you likewiſe, when
you ſee the ſame glory rule in others, in which
you rejoyce: And this is the laſt encounter the
Father wil have with the Dragon. This is the great day
of Judgment (judging and condemning, and putting
the Serpent to death every where) This is the day of
Chriſt power, in which he wil ſubdue all his enemies
under his ſeet, &amp; deliver up the Kingdom to his Father</p>
               <p>Therefore marvel not to ſee the people turn from
one way of worſhip to another; for the Father is
driving this people through al the waies, and forms,
and cuſtoms, and reformation, and governments
of the Beaſt, to weary them out in all; that ſo they
may find reſt for the ſoles of their feet no where, in
no outward form of worſhip; til they come to lye
down in him (forſaking all forms) to worſhip the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in ſpirit and trurh; that is, to walk righteouſly
in the Creation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:35008:58"/>
And this reſtleſneſſe of people, running from one
form and cuſtome to another, meeting with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
and curſe every where, is no other but the
dividing of time, the half day or image of the
Beaſt, which is the laſt period of his time: Then
faith the Angel, It is done, time to the Beaſt ſhal
be no more.</p>
               <p>And while it is thus,<note place="margin">Pſa. 40. 2.</note> poor Creatures they are in
bondage within, for they know not what to do;
the way to Sion is not yet cleare, and they are
filled with ſighings and ſecret mournings, to ſee

mire, but cannot come out: This is inward ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
under which they lie.</p>
               <p>Then, poor Creatures, they are under an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
bondage, under the hand of Tyrant fleſh,
that rules the Kingdom, and that diviſes the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
fleſhy forms and waies of government, to which
if any refuſe to conform, then they muſt be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned,
reproached or tortured by puniſhments,
in what kind or other, by the hands of fellow
Creatures, that are the oppreſſing Taſk maſters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Tyrant fleſh; ſo that weak ſpirits are kept
under in awe, either by fear or ſhame: And thus
<hi>Iacob</hi> hath been very, low but he muſt riſe.</p>
               <p>For the Antichriſtian Captivitie is expiring, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
have attained to inward freedom already, they
wait upon the Lord for outward freedom, that
the yoke may be taken off their backs: <hi>Iſrael's</hi>
Captivitie in the 70 years in the <hi>Bahylon</hi> was but a type
of this Antichriſtian ſlavery under L. <hi>Eſau,</hi> the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the fleſh, that compaſſes mankind about with
many ſtraits &amp; dangers, for acknowledging his Maker.</p>
               <p>But as every thing hath his growth, his raign and
end, ſo muſt this ſlavery have an end; The proud and
covetous hearts cry, what ſlavery is this? we know

               <p>TO ſee the Divine power in the Creation-objects
is ſweet; but to ſee him ruling in the heart is
ſweeter: The firſt ſight is at diſtance far off, as to
ſee him in mear, drink, cloaths, friends, victories,
riches, proſperity, to ſee him in the Sun, Moon,
Stars, Clouds, Graſſe, Trees, Cattle, and all the
Earth, how he hath ſweetly cause every one of theſe
to give in aſſiſtance to preſerve each other Creature:
Or rather how he himſelf in theſe gives forth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
and protection from one another, and ſo
unites the whole Creation together, by the unity
of himſelf.</p>
               <p>Or further, to ſee the Divine power in prayer, in
Diſcourſe, in Communion of Saints, in Reading,
in every ſweet; and refreſhnigs that a man meets
within all theſe, is the Almightly Comforter:
But this is to behold that glory abroad, to ſee and
meet him from home, to behold him in Creatures
without us: which ſight and enjoyment is often,
and may be totally loſt and the ſoul left alone again,
and ſo filled with mourning in his abſence, O when
ſhall I ſee my beloved, whom my ſoul loves.</p>
               <p>The Spouſe had ſeen Chriſt in the manner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
but ſhe had loſt him again; for if ſhe had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſeen him, ſhe could not have called him her
Beloved, and mourn in his abſence. Let a man
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:35008:59"/>
eat never ſo hearty a dinner, yet within a few hours
he wil be empty again and ready to languiſh; and
thus all comforts that are taken in from any
creature without us, may be, nay wil be, muſt be
loſt, that ſo a man may come to know the Lord.</p>
               <p>But now to ſee the King ſitting in his banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſes,
to ſee the Law of Righteouſneſſe and
peace ruling and dwelling in the heart, and to be

                  </gap>e ſweet ſmelling ſpices, the
diſcoveries of the Fathers love within; This is the
Word of God; This is ſweeter then the honey or
the honey-comb, for this is to ſee him near at
hand, even within the heart ruling and reſting there.</p>
               <p>This is the Kingdome of heaven within you; This
is the city of refuge that wil not ſail a man; This is
the Rock of defence and offence; This the power
that makes a man bold as a Lion; If a man be caſt
into any ſtraits, his heart dies not like <hi>Nabals</hi> the
man of the fleſh; but he feels peace and content
within, and ſo is at reſt.</p>
               <p>Let come what wil come, the man knows it is
the wil of the Father it ſhal be ſo, and he feels a
quiet peace compaſſe his heart, ſo that he ſeeth
and feeleth peace within; and rejoyceth in the
excellency of it, he ſeeth and feeleth love and
patience within, and rejoyceth in the glory of that
ſweet ointment, that doth caſt a delightful favour
all his ſoul over.</p>
               <p>Now though this man be in priſon, be in ſtraits,
be forſaken of all his friends in the fleſh, none wil
buy nor ſell with him, becauſe they count him a
man of ſtrange opinions and blaſphemies, call him an
Atheiſt, a ſot, a Papiſt, a blaſphemer that hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
God and goodneſſe, becauſe he wil neither
preach nor pray, nor ſay grace when he ſitteth
down to meat, as the cuſtome of Profeſſours are.</p>
               <p>Yet this man is not alone, for his Father is with
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35008:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him, The Father lives in him, and he lives in the
Father.</p>
               <p>The Father wil have his people, whom he draws
up to worſhip him in ſpirit and truth, to be ſecret
and ſilent; to be flow of ſpeech for a little ſeaſon,
yet quick-ſighted and Eagle-eyed, though they be
ſilent, they are not ſottiſh drones, they ſhall
diſcern and judge others righteouſly, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſhall not diſcern and judge them, but by raſh
cenſure, which is not righteous.</p>
               <p>The righteous actions and patient ſilence, of thoſe
that are drawn up to wait upon the Lord, ſhall be
the greateſt ſhame and condemnation to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
profeſſours, and talking people that ever broke
out. The wiſe fleſh that would be an Angel of light,
is full of towords, but dead to the Law of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
The Saints muſt die to waſte words, but he
made alive to Righteouſneſſe, walking uprightly in
the Creation, to the glory of the Maker of all things;
hereby Lord <hi>Eſau</hi> will be under-mined, and his
houſe and Kingdon wil fall about his ears.</p>
               <p>For though the man of the fleſh be altogether for
outward preaching, praying, obſervation of forms
and cuſtoms, and knows not how to worſhip, if
theſe be taken away: he hath no peace if theſe
be gone.</p>
               <p>But now the man of Righteouſneſſe ſees death in
all outward forms, if the inward power be wanting;
therfore his eye is ſtil inward, to ſee the Law of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
ruling there, and guiding the body to be
a profitable member in the Creation. And this is
the moſt excellent ſight, to ſee the divine power in
ones ſelf, ruling, dwelling and living within; which
if it doe, that body wherein it dwels, ſhal be wholly
ſubject in al his to that Law of Righteneſſe.</p>
               <p>They that know what the power of love and the
Law of Righteouſneſſe is, they know what I ſay, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35008:60"/>
can underſtand me; but to others theſe reports
ſound ſtrangely, and may draw words of reproach
and ſlander from them; but it matters not, they
cannot hurt.</p>
               <p>They that live in the light, they ſee the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and they ſee him at home, they ſee him in
other creatures, and they ſee and feel him in their
own hearts, in patient and quiet ſubmitting, to what
is his will; ſo that there is a ſweet agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the diſpoſing hand of God without, and his
power within.</p>
               <p>He that thus ſees the Lord, the antient of daies,
the one Almighty power, doth mightily honour
him; when nothing can be done abroad, either in
adverſity or proſparity, but the divine power that
rules in the heart, conſents, rejoices and grudges
not. And now the Lord is one, and his name or
power one, every where.</p>
               <p>The ſight of the King of Glory within, lies not in
the ſtrength of memory, calling to mind what a man
hath read and heard, being able by a humane capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to joyn things together into a method; &amp; through
the power of free utterance, to hold it forth before
others, as the faſhion of Students are in their Sermon
work; which a plough man that was never bread in
their Univerſities may do as much; nay, they do
more in kind (as experience ſhews us) then they
that take Tyſhes to tell a ſtory.</p>
               <p>But the ſight of the King within, lies in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
of light ariſing up from an inward power of
ſeeling experience, filling the ſoul with the glory
of the Law of Righteouſneſſe, which doth not vaniſh
like the taking in of words and comfort from the
mouth of a hear ſay Preacher, or ſtrength of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>But it continues like the Sunne in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhining forth, from that eſtabliſhed power
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35008:60"/>
of the divine within, and the enlivened heart ſhall
as ſoon be ſeperated from glorying in the Law of
Righteouſneſſe that dwels in him; then the heat
and light of the Sunne, can be ſeperated from the
Sunne.</p>
               <p>And truly let me tell you, That as a man finds
abundance of ſweet peace in his heart, when he is
made to live in the Kingdome of heaven: So the
words hat this man ſpeaks from this power within,
are very profitable to others, &amp; are good ſeed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
they are ſown, they will ſpring up and bring
forth fruit, for words ſpoken from the light of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
have a two-fold operation upon the heart
of the hearers.</p>
               <p>For firſt, if I lie under ſtraits and bondage in my
ſpirit, by reaſon of ſome inward and outward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
but eſpecially by reaſon of the enthraldome to
my own luſts that over powers me, ſo that I cannot
do what I would.</p>
               <p>Then the words of experience from the mouth of
one that hath been in that condition, and is paſſed
thorow it, ſounds liberty and life to my weary ſoul;
I ſpeak what I have felt in this particular.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If I delight in any way of the fleſh, as
to ſeek peace in creatures abroad without me, or to
ſeek ſatisfaction to my envy, ſelf-will and luſt; and
in the midſt of this my folly I do occaſionally hear
the words of experience from ſome other, declaring
ſuch actions and motions to be the powers of the
fleſh and devil, and not of the ſpirit of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Preſently thoſe words take peace from the earth;
that is, from proud fleſh; and fill the whole ſoul with
anger, diſtemper, grudging, and torment. And this is
another operation that pure language produces,
which is a launcing of the dead fleſh that the diſeaſe
may be cured.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:35008:61"/>
For this wounding is nor to the mine of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but it is a medicine ſent from the Lord to heal
him; to take away the evil peace from the fleſh,
that ſo the created part may lie down in reſt, and be
at peace in Chriſt, which cannot be moved.</p>
               <p>For every comfort that is of the fleſh ſhall be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and removed, but Chriſt the one power of
Righteouſneſſe and peace, ſhall not be ſhaken nor
moved, but ſtand firm for ever. And by this you
may ſee the difference between the kingdom of the
fleſh and devil, which muſt be ſhaken to pieces and
fall: And the kingdom of heaven or of God, that
endures for ever, and is that Rock due cannot be
moved.</p>

               <p>What is the kingdom of Heaven, or of Chriſt?</p>

               <p>What is it for a man to live in the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> When mankind or any ſingle perſon is ſo made
ſubject to the King of righteouſneſſe, that all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
is to walk according to that law towards every
creature in the Creation, through love to the Fathers
honour that made al. He glories in that law of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
which he finds ſeated in his heart, &amp; finds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
no where elſe; and when the Spirit is honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
this man is in his kingdom, he hath what he would
have.</p>
               <p>While the kingdom of darkneſſe rules in a man, if
he knows it not, his ſin is the leſſe, but when he
comes to know the luſts of his fleſh, and delight
therein, in oppoſition to the righteous Law which he
ſees ſome light in alſo; this makes the man exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſinfull, for now he ſins againſt the law of light
ſhining in him, and cauſing him to ſee himſelf.</p>
               <p>Even ſo when the divine power rules in a man,
and he knows it nor, as it may be in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
this mans joy is but ſmall; for a man may act

               <p>But when a man is made to ſee and know the law
of love and righteouſneſſe within him, and delights
to act from that power of life and liberty, which he
ſeeth and feeleth ſeated in him. Now this man is
carried on with much joy and ſweet calmneſs, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and moderation, and is full of glory. This is
the excellency of the work of Chriſt, not onely to
make fleſh ſubject to rigeteouſneſſe, but to know
himſelf made ſubject, &amp; to rejoyce in the ſweet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of that prince of peace, to make a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,

               <p>What do you mean by divine, and divine power?</p>
               <p>I anwer, The divine is the ſpreadinq power of
righteouſneſſe, which is Chriſt that filleth the whole
Creation with himſelf.</p>
               <p>And he is called a tree or a vine, becauſe he doth
not lie in one ſingle perſon, but ſpreads himſelf in
mankind, and every ſingle body in whom he breaths,
is but a bough or bud of the vine.</p>
               <p>So that look upon all together in whom Chriſt is
ſpread, and they make up but one vine, knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by that one ſpirit, into one body; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be poor or rich; learned or unlearned;
and therefore thoſe rich men that deſpiſe the poor;
and thoſe learned Univerſity men that deſpiſe the
unlearned, are pricks of the thorn-buſh, not bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the vine; they be the curſe that is now near
to burning.</p>
               <p>And every ſingle one alone in whom Chriſt breaths,
is but a parcel of the vine, in whom the divine power
dwels and reſts Even as every branch of an Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,
is filled with the ſap, which is the life of the
whole tree.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is ſaid to be the divine, becauſe he grows
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35008:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and flouriſhes in the time of light; he is the Sonne
himſelf; he is a vine or tree that grows by day in
the heat of light, and ſo brings forth abundance of
fruit to the glory of the Father; Trees that grow
in the heat of the Sun bring ſorth pleaſant fruit.</p>
               <p>So thoſe that are branches of this vine, that grows
in the heat and life of one ſpirit the King of Bighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
bring forth abundance of the fruit of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
according to the nature of the vine they
grow from.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Saints are called, Children of the
day, not of the night; for they ſpeak what they
know in experience, and what they have received
feelingly from the Lord; and their actions and words
are not at random, for they act Righteouſneſs within
the Creation, from the law of Reaſon and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
which they feel ſeated within.</p>
               <p>Every one that doth act or ſpeak from the light
and power of the day-vine within himſelf, can give an
account of his words and actions: But this is the
glory, that <hi>Adam,</hi> the man of the fleſh hides himſelf
from: This is the Law of Righteouſneſſe, which
fleſhly Iſrael could not behold: This is the new
Covenant which our Clergie is unacquainted with.</p>
               <p>Now oppoſite to this Divine, which is Chriſt,
there is a night-vine, which is the power of ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
or the bottom eſſe pit ſpread abroad in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
And every man and woman that is guided by
this ſelfiſh power of darkneſſe, are but branches of
the night-vine.</p>
               <p>And this nigt-vine which I called Lord <hi>Eſau,</hi> or
fleſhly man, hath filled the whole earth with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
(under pretence of his learning and fleſhly Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment)
ſo that he is a ſpread tree. But he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the Spirit, the Thorn-buſh.</p>
               <p>The fruit that he brings forth is ſour and bitter,
and good for nothing but the dunghill; for trees that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:35008:63"/>
grow alwayes in the ſhade or place of darkneſſe,
where the heat and light of the Sun doth not coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
brings forth unpleaſant fruit.</p>
               <p>Now this night-vine (but rather Thorn-buſh) is the
branching forth of the wiſdom and power of ſelfiſh
fleſh, every bud from it, is a ſharp prickle: treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
&amp; covetous <hi>Judas,</hi> is one branch from that root,
and he hath riſen up to a mighty great tree; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
treacherous and covetous heart, is but the bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
forth of <hi>Judas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So envious Scribes &amp; Phariſees, are other branches
from the ſame root, &amp; theſe have riſen up into migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſpreading trees; for every one that is zealous with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowledge, making a profeſſion of the ſpirit of
righteouſneſſe, &amp; yet grudging and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the ſpirit, are but the buddings forth of the Scribes &amp;
Phariſees, that killed Chriſt after the fleſh, and now is
ſpread in every Land and Family, to hinder Chriſt
from riſing, or elſe to ſuppreſſe and kill him againe
if they could after he is riſen up in ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>So covetous <hi>Demas,</hi> proud <hi>Simon Mugus,</hi> fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Nabal,</hi> unrighteous <hi>Elimas,</hi> and ſuch like, are
all the buddings forth of the thorn-buſh, and have
covered the earth with their branches, to keep it in

               <p>And all theſe are centred in the Clergy, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities
are the ſtanding ponds of ſtinking waters,
that make thoſe trees grow, the curſe of ignorance,
conſuſion and bondage ſpreads from hence all the
Nations over.</p>
               <p>The paying of tythes, the greateſt ſin of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

Their Churches are the ſucceſſours of the <hi>Jews</hi>

are ſucceſſours of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi>
houſes of learning. And though they perſecuted Chriſt
and the Apoſtles, and would own none of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines;
yet when they found that Chriſts Doctrines
began to fill the earth, and to make the way of the
Law odious, and their trade began to fail.</p>
               <p>Then did thoſe houſes of learning begin to take
in and own the writings of the Apoſtles, and to
own that doctrine, prevailing with the Magiſtracy
through the deceit of their ſubtilety, to eſtabliſh
tythes in their hands ſtill for their maintainance
(though Chriſts doctrine threw down that oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.)
And then from legall Sacrificers, they became
hearſay-Preachers of the Goſpel, not from any te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of light within themſelves, but from the
writings of the Apoſtles, which they profeſſe great
love to, and keep charily, for their tythes ſake; and
by the one they deceive the ſouls of people, for they
preach the letter for the Spirit, and by the other
they pick their purſes.</p>
               <p>And this is very manifeſt by their carriage; for
though thoſe writings which they live by, were not
writings that proceeded from any Schollars, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to humane art, but from Fiſhermen, Shepherds,
Huſband men, and the Carpenters ſon, who ſpake
and writ as the Spirit gave them utterance, from an
inward teſtimony.</p>
               <p>Yet now theſe learned ſchollars have got the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of theſe inferior men of the world ſo called, do
now ſlight, deſpiſe and trample them under feet,
preſſing upon the powers of the earth, to make laws
to hold them under bondage, and that lay-people,
tradeſ-men, and ſuch as are not bred in ſchools, may
have no liberty to ſpeak or write of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>And why ſo? Becauſe out of theſe deſpiſed ones,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:35008:64"/>
doth the ſpirit riſe up more and more to clearer
light, making them to ſpeak from experience; and
every freſh diſcovery of the Father, ſhines more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
then the old, till at laſt the creature is made to
ſee the Father face to face in his own light.</p>
               <p>But now the learned ſchollars having no inward
teſtimony of their own to uphold their trade by a
cuſtomary practice, they hold faſt the old letter, get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their living by telling the people, the meanings
of thoſe tradeſ-mens words and writings; but alas,
they mightily corrupt their meaning, by their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of falſe expoſitions and interpretations; for
no man knows the meaning of the ſpirit, but he that
hath the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>And if the- Father ſend forth any of theſe tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to declare the teſtimony which is in them, as
in theſe dayes he ſends forth many. And theſe true
labourers ſhall encreaſe, let the Univerſitie men do
the worſt they can; yet the Schollars ſeek to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe

blaſphemers, and the like.</p>
               <p>And why do they all this? Becauſe the light of
truth that ſprings up out of this earth, which the
ſchollars tread under feet, will ſhine ſo clear, as it
will put out the candle of thoſe wicked learned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers.</p>
               <p>And therefore many of them that are more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nnous
or ſubtile then the reſt, ſeeing light ariſes
much amongſt the people, begin to comply with the
people, and give people their liberty to ſpeak as
well as they, and denie the tithes upon this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the people will give them a free contribution,
and own them as the chief Preachers and Prophets
ſent of God, and to look upon themſelves as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
to the ſchollars.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſtir up people to gather into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
and to make choice of one man to be
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:35008:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their Preacher, though they ſhall have a liberty to
ſpeak in the Congregation as well as he. But, all this
is but deceit of the fleſh, to draw people under a
new bondage, and to uphold the hearſay-preaching,
that in time matters may be wheeled about again, to
advance the ſchollars, and give them the ſupremacy
in teaching.</p>
               <p>And what is the end of all this; but onely to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Chriſt the great Prophet from riſing, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
people ſhould all look up to him for teaching, and
acknowledge no other teacher and ruler but Chriſt,
the Law of Righteouſneſſe dwelling in every mans
heart; the ſchollars would have the people to look
up to them for teaching; and truly let me ſpeak what
I find, the more that you look upon them, or any
men for teaching, the more you ſhall be wrapped up
in confuſion and bondage.</p>
               <p>And therefore the upſhot of all your Univerſities
and publick Preachers, and men-teachers, is onely
to hinder Chriſt from riſing, and to keep <hi>Jacob</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and make him a ſervant and a ſlave to the man
of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>So that all this do in the world about, hear-ſay
preaching and ſetled forms of worſhip, is no other
but the ſpreadings forth of the thorn-buſh, the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man, to hinder the worſhip of the Father in ſpirit
and truth: And all thoſe ſtrict and zealous. Preachers
and Profeſſours of other mens words and writings,
and upholders of forms and cuſtoms, are no other
but the Scribes, Phariſees and <hi>Judas,</hi> that ſtill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
Chriſt in enmity.</p>
               <p>And this is the Reaſon, why man-kind are ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and cold-ſpirited, in the acknowledgment of
the Father; becauſe the night-Vine, or blanches of
the Thorn-buſh, are ſo mighty great and thick, that
they hide the light and heat of the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:35008:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This is the man of ſin, the myſterie of iniquity,
that lets and muſt let, till he be taken out of the
way: Indeed this Thorn-buſh doth ſo prick, that
none dares meddle with it, unleſſe he be well cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This Thorn-buſh or night-Vine grows in the cold
time of the night, while the Sun of Righteouſneſſe
is under the Clouds; and the fruit it brings forth is
unpleaſant, as pride, covetouſneſſe, envy, ſelf-love,
hypocriſie, confuſion, bondage, and all the miſery
under the power of darkneſſe, to make Lord <hi>Eſau</hi> a
compleat Tyrant; and they that act from this Vine,
are called children of the night.</p>
               <p>Now from hence it appears, what horrible proud
men the Clergie are, that call themſelves Divines;
or Chriſt that grows in the light of the Father, when
alas their light is but a candle ſtoln from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
and Prophets writings, it is not their own
light, it is but hear-ſay in them.</p>
               <p>Surely their pride and covetouſneſſe declares them
to be the falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophers, and that
they are branches of the Thorn-buſh, that are full of
ſharp pricks, in regard they endeavour to uphold a
forced maintenance from the people, whether they
will or no; and force the people to be ſilent, to hear
them preach hear-ſay: and not to gainſay or queſtion
what they ſay under pain of puniſhment, or being
counted factious, or ſowers of ſedition.</p>
               <p>This is the bondage the people are under, by theſe
publique Preachers: Firſt, they are filled with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
by their ſaying and unſaying, for they know
not what they ſay, they darken knowledge by their
words. Secondly, they are like to be cruſhed in

               <p>While I was ſuch a one, I ſay, I was counted by
ſome of the Prieſts, a good Chriſtian, and a godly man,
though all that was in me, was but zealous ignorance:
But ſince it pleaſed the Father to reveal his Son in
me, and cauſe me to ſpeak what I know from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
light and power of life within.</p>
               <p>Now both the ſame Prieſts, and the Profeſſours,
whom they have deceived; my former acquaintance
now begin to be afraid of me, and call me a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and a man of errors, and look upon me as a
man of a nother world; for my own particular, my
portion is fallen to me in a good ground; I have
the Lord, I have enough.</p>
               <p>I look upon them with the eye of pitty and love,
ſeeing them as yet to lie under thoſe ſtrong deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and powers of darkneſſe, which I my ſelf did lie
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:35008:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>
under, waiting upon the great reſtorer of all things,
till he manifeſt himſelf in them, and then we ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
one againe, and never be divided.</p>
               <p>O my dear friends in the fleſh, deſpiſe not this
word I ſpeak; wait upon the Lord for teaching;
you will never have reſt in your ſouls, till he ſpeak in
you: run after men for teaching, follow your forms
with ſtrictneſſe, as you know I have done, you ſhall
ſtill be at loſſe, and be more and more wrapped up
in confuſion and ſorrow of heart: I ſpeak what I
have found.</p>
               <p>But when once your heart is made ſubject to Chriſt,
the law of righteouſneſſe, looking up to him for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
waiting with a meek and quiet ſpirit, till
he appear in you: then you ſhall have peace, then
you ſhall know the trurh, and the truth ſhall make
you free; then you ſhall know that I ſpeake truth.</p>
               <p>Well, I wil conclude, and leave this writing in
the hand of the world; Some may be offended at
it, if they be, I care not: Some may have their
joy fullfilled in ſeeing a conjuncture of experience
between me and them: Though my words may
ſeem ſharp to ſome, yet I do not write them out of
any envy to any man, but out of love to all; and
ſo doing to my fellow creatures, as I would they
ſhould do to me; walking (in this particular, as
my endeavour is in all other) uprightly and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
in the Creation; ſpeaking the truth as it is in
Jeſus; that is, ſpeaking my own words, what I ſee
and feel in my own experience, from that light of
Chriſt within, and not by hear-ſay or imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whereby humane learning in matters of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
things, deceives all the world, and laps every
man up in darkneſſe: So I reſt.</p>
