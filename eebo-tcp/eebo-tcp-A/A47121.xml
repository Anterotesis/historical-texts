            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Anti-chriſt's and Sadduces DETECTED, Among a ſort of QUAKERS.</head>
            <p>IN the firſt place, it is fit I ſhould give the Readers ſome Information who the Second Days Meeting at <hi>London</hi> is. It is a Meeting of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of them, called Quakers, of <hi>William Penns</hi> and <hi>George Whiteheads</hi> Party, belonging to <hi>London,</hi> and ſome of the Country that may happen to be preſent, who Meet at <hi>Whitehart-Court</hi> in <hi>Lombard-Street,</hi> every Second day of the Week, and aſſume a Power to Licenſe and Approve of all Books that are to be Printed by any of their Party, and have approved this Book, falſely called, <hi>A Modeſt Account,</hi> and all the late ſcandalous Books of <hi>Thomas Elwood</hi> and <hi>John Pennington,</hi> come forth againſt me, and claim Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over all other Meetings (the Yearly Meeting perhaps excepted) ſending out their Circular Letters to all other Meetings in all parts of the World, as they think they have occaſion, and to whom the Meetings from all places, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their Letters upon any occurrence of difference (as the Churches and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of other Countries had wont to direct their Letters to <hi>Rome,</hi> which was the Riſe of that <hi>Roman Hierarchy)</hi> the which Meeting may be fitly compared to the Conclave of Cardinals at <hi>Rome,</hi> but who is the Metropolitan of this new erected <hi>Hierarchy</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> at preſent, is not certainly known, as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>W. P.</hi> or <hi>G. W.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He doth acknowledg, 1ſt. differences in point of Doctrine. 2. Principal differences. How doth this agree with many of them called the Church Party here, who ſay, They do not deny <hi>G. K</hi>'s Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47493:3"/>
P. 8. As concerning the Sufficiency of the Light, without ſomething elſe (that he ſaith you have made ſuch a pudder about of late) for this he brings a Proof from my Book, <hi>Light of Truth,</hi> p. 12. and 6. where I ſay the expreſs Knowledg and Belief, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is not univerſally of abſolute neceſſity unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo I ſay ſtill, annd ſo ſaith <hi>R. Barclay,</hi> whom he abuſeth as well as me, for we both frequently caution and limit the matter, ſaying the clear diſtinct expreſs Hiſtorical Knowledg is not univerſally neceſſary. See my Book, <hi>Univerſal Grace,</hi> p. 117. <hi>ad Finem.</hi> But whereas he <note place="margin">Of Chriſt Crucified.</note> ſtates the difference in point of Doctrine betwixt ſome in <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania,</hi> and me, as if I ſaid, it were an Error to affirm, 'the Light within were ſufficient, without ſomething elſe, which I never ſo ſaid, nor thought, for the Light within is ſufficient without, not only ſomething elſe, but without thouſands of ſomethings elſe; But my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion was and is, 'The Light within is not ſufficient to Salvation without 'ſomething elſe, which they blaming, they ought to hold the contradictory aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> The Light within is ſufficient to Salvation, without any thing elſe, for two contradictories are not betwixt two particulars, but one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and another Univerſal; now ſeeing they hold, 'that the Light within 'is ſufficient without any thing elſe, it is plain they Exclude the Man Chriſt without us, and his Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from being concerned in our Salvation.</p>
            <p>P. 8. He baſely forges me to ſay, It is a real degree of Blaſphemy to ſay this Light cannot make ſatisfaction for ſins paſt, citing pag. 38. 39. <hi>Refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> See the place, I have no ſuch words, but plain contrary. I ſay, <hi>Refut.</hi> p. 42. 43. Neither is the Saints greateſt inward Righteouſneſs or Holineſs wrought in them by the Spirit of God, an Atonement or Propitiation for their ſins, but Chriſt alone, who Dyed for us, the juſt for the unjuſt.</p>
            <p>P. 9. He cites my Book, <hi>Looking-glaſs for Proteſtants,</hi> p. 10. That Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates may Preach, which he thinks a contradiction to my late Teſtimony with Friends in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> that Friends of the Miniſtry ſhould not meddle to be Juſtices and Judges in Criminal Caſes; but this is no contradiction, for it is one thing occaſionally to Preach, or Teach, or Exhort, as any Chriſtian can do, and another to exerciſe the Office or Function of a Miniſter of the Goſpel of Peace one day, that ſaith, Reſiſt not Evil, and our Weapons are not Carnal, and another day to hang Men for Murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which ſcarce any that profeſs to be Miniſters do in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> but the Quakers in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. 9. That I ſay of Chriſts Body now in Heaven, <hi>It being no more a Body of Fleſh, Blood, and Bones, but a pure ethereal, or Heavenly Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> This he brings to prove a contradiction to my ſelf, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Citing</hi> Way caſt up. p. 113. <hi>falſe quot. true quot.</hi> p. 131.</note> out the foregoing words,<hi>—Which remaineth the ſame in Subſtance, that it was on Earth,</hi> &amp;c. So that by my ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it being no more a Body of Fleſh and Blood, I mean it in the Apoſtles ſenſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit,</hi> &amp;c. See my words cited by himſelf, p. 10. a Teſtimony againſt the falſe and abſurd Op. The Fleſh that is mortal, groſs and corruptible, is not the Fleſh that ſhall be raiſed up immortal and incorruptible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:47493:3"/>
P. 12. He makes me to contradict my ſelf in ſaying, Presb. and Indep. p. 133. The Expreſs Knowledg of Chriſt, his becoming Man, and ſuffering, was poſitively denied to be of neceſſity to Salvation, but now I furiouſly quarrel with Friends about it, that it is. But his fallacy lyeth in this, that I ſay, the expreſs Knowledg is not <hi>univerſally</hi> neceſſary, but ſome knowledg, if not expreſs, yet implicit, is, and this is no Contradiction.</p>
            <p>P. 15. He Argues from my Book, <hi>The Light of Truth,</hi> p. 8. That the Light within is the only Chriſt, and he ſaith, p. 14. the word only admits of nothing elſe, than Light, Power and Spirit within.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Here it is manifeſt, he placeth all on the Light within, ſo that the man Chriſt Jeſus of <hi>Nazoreth</hi> without us, is nothing of Chriſt; but as his Aſſertion, and Conſequence is Blaſphemous, ſo it follows not from my words; for as I then ſaid, ſo I ſtill ſay, Chriſt is but one, and there are not two Chriſts, one within, and another without; but it will not follow, that there is nothing of Chriſt without us, but what is within us. Suppoſe <hi>Caleb Puſey</hi>'s Head is without the Houſe, and ſome, or moſt of his Body is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Houſe, as is poſſible, the <hi>Caleb Puſey</hi> that is within, is the ſame that is without, yet there is ſomething of him without, that is not within, it is the ſame Body of Water in the Complex, that is in the <hi>Thames,</hi> and in the Sea, yet it follows not that there is nothing of the great and vaſt Body of Water, but what is within the <hi>Thames.</hi> But when Men that have neither Learning, nor good Exerciſe of Human Reaſon, will meddle to Diſpute, we ſee how ignorant they prove themſelves to be in the face of the World, or how they expoſe themſelves in Print, neither to be true Chriſtians, nor Men of true Reaſon; he had better kept with working at his Mill, being by profeſſion a Miller, than enter into a Diſpute of matters wherein he is ſo groſly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the Second Days Meeting at <hi>London</hi> hath countenanced his Book, and the Quakers generally at <hi>London</hi> allow it to be Sold next door to their Meeting-houſe in <hi>Grace-Church-ſtreet,</hi> they make his ignorance, unbelief, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciſm and Antichriſtian Doctrine to be theirs.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing my Book, called, <hi>The Light of Truth,</hi> in Anſwer to <hi>R. Gordon,</hi> was approved by the Second Days Meeting, and that he would infer from my words, That Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> cannot be ſomething elſe than the Light, Power and Spirit within, it is plain, that it is both their Senſe and his, that Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is nothing at all of Chriſt without us, which is a plain contradiction to themſelves, and to himſelf in his following words. But no ſuch conſequence doth really follow from my words.</p>
            <p>P. 17. He ſo mingles my words with his own, that no man can diſtinguiſh the one from the other, but the Reader that doth not compare my words in my own Book, with his Citations, would think them to be mine, for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as my words are in the pag. cited by him.—For whereas thou not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that Salvation and Juſtification hath a neceſſary reſpect to Chriſt his taking on him the form of a Servant, or Man in the outward, and humbling himſelf therein, even to the outward Death, (which we alſo grant, God
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47493:4"/>
having ſo ordered it to be) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He makes as if I ſaid, (his words are for as <hi>G. K.</hi> ſaith) the Lord having ordained it ſo to be, how can or dare we ſay therefore, that he was, or is not ſufficient, by his Light, Power and Spirit, to ſave without ſomething elſe. But ſee Reader his Forgery, I ſay no ſuch words, but my words are a plain contradiction, by neceſſary conſequence to his preſumptuous aſſertion, for ſeeing God had Ordained it ſo to be (as I have ſaid) that our Salvation and Juſtification hath a neceſſary reſpect to Chriſt his taking on him the form of a Servant in the outward, therefore it evidently followeth, that God could not ſave us without reſpect to the Man Chriſt in the outward, otherwiſe he could or ſhould contradict his own Ordination; but as God cannot lye, ſo nor can he contradict his own Counſel and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and therefore the preſumption is his and not mine. And ſeeing they grant that God in the Man Chriſt without us, cannot ſave us without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward work of his Power and Spirit within us, to Regenerate and Sanctify us, which is a Truth, and yet is no Reflection on his Sufficiency and Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, ſo nor is it any reflection on him, that God in us cannot ſave us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Man Chriſt without us, for he is as truly God without us, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more manifeſt in the Man Chriſt without us, than in us.</p>
            <p>P. 19. He ſaith, I expoſed Friends to the World in Print, for retaking a Sloop, without ever admoniſhing them before hand for it, and that when I reckoned my ſelf an Elder in the Church among them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a groſs falſhood and Forgery, I Printed nothing about their retaking a Sloop, till a conſiderable time, after 28 of the Miniſters had Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated me at <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> to which Sentence, ſome that gave a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to retake the ſloop by force of Arms, did put their hands, and all the reſt conſented, and they have diſowned me to be any Member of their Church, and how then could I own my ſelf to be any of them? which I did not. So that this whole paſſage is falſe, and a wilful piece of Forgery.</p>
            <p>P. 20. He alſo alledgeth, That I came to them, and commended them for what they did, and ſaid, It was very well done, adding, methinks you ſhould conſider theſe things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But what proof brings he for his Affirmation? None at all, and he having ſufficiently diſcovered his groſs forgery in other things, rendreth his credit of no value in this; and I well remember that at the retaking of the Sloop, I was not in the Province; but that I commended them that they had done well, to ſend Armed men to retake the Sloop, I affirm is an abſolute for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, for it never was my Principle, ſince I was called a Quaker, and I have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to bear me witneſs, that it hath been my conſtant Principle that Friends ſhould not in any caſe uſe the Carnal Sword; and the ſame Principle <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> in his Apology, hath largely aſſerted, and whom we have quoted, and it is well known that many of greateſt note among the Quakers hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the ſame. And ſuppoſe I did ſay, that they who did retake the Sloop did well, which I do not remember, all this might have been well ſaid without any contradiction, or equivocation, for it was <hi>Peter Boſſe,</hi> and one or two more with him in a little Boat, having neither Gun, Sword nor Spear, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47493:4"/>
retook the Sloop, when a great many Armed Men that filled ſeveral Boats ſtood off at a diſtance, and were afraid to come within ſhot, and ſo the praiſe of that work belonged to him, and not to them, and the Magiſtrates did ill reward him, for they not long after Fined him 6 Pounds, and put him in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for ſome paſſages writ to <hi>Sam. Jennings</hi> in a private Letter, and kept him in Priſon 20 miles remote from his Family, till the Magiſtrates that were Quakers, and had caſt him into Priſon, were turned out of the Government by <hi>G. Fletcher,</hi> who was made Governour of <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> by a Commiſſion from K. <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and how ſoon he came unto the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he Releaſed him, after inquiry, that they had nothing juſtly againſt him.

            <p>P. 22. Whereas he makes me to ſay, in one Book, The expreſs knowledg of Chriſt's Death and Sufferings, as Man in the outward, is not univerſally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation: And in another, That the expreſs Knowledg of Chriſt's Death, is univerſally neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this he uſeth (after his manner) groſs deceit, and greatly abuſeth his Reader and me alſo, for tho he citeth a paſſage in one of my Books, to prove the firſt, <hi>viz. Presh. and Indep. Viſ.</hi> p. 133. Yet he cites no paſſage in any of my Books, for the ſecond that I can find, tho I have narrowly ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the only proof I can find he brings is, that he ſaith, p. 15. I furiouſly quarrel with Friends about it, and confeſs it to be a main matter of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy with Friends there. This is falſe, I never had any Controverſy with any, whether the expreſs Knowledg and Faith of Chriſt's Death and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings be univerſally neceſſary to Man's Salvation, ſo as neceſſary to be had by all and every one before Death. But the true ſtate of the Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and me, was and is, Whether the expreſs Knowledg and Faith of Chriſt's Death and Sufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be not neceſſary to Salvation, to all Profeſſing Chriſtianity, and who have the opportunity and help of the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, whereby to receive it, the Holy Spirit inwardly co-operating to produce the Faith of it in them that hear or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47493:5"/>
read that Doctrine, as delivered in the Holy Scriptures; and whether the Doctrine of Chriſt ſhould not be Preached, as he Died for our Sins, and roſe again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a main Doctrine of the Chriſtian Religion in order to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! For I have always diſtinguiſhed betwixt ſimple Heathens or Gentiles, who have not the occaſion to have the Faith outwardly Preached, and thoſe in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> under a Chriſtian Profeſſion, who have the occaſion to hear it Preached; to the former I have ſaid; the expreſs Knowledg and Faith of that Doctrine is not neceſſary, tho the implicit in ſome degree is, but how much, or what meaſure or degree of it is univerſally neceſſary I have never affirmed? And that this is the true ſtate of the queſtion betwixt my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries and me, I need go no further for a Proof than from my preſent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, who makes it a great Error in me, to ſay, the Light within is not ſufficient to Salvation, without ſomething elſe; for if that be falſe, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory is true, <hi>viz.</hi> The Light within is ſufficient to Salvation, without any thing elſe, but the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt, and his Blood out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſhed, and his Interceſſion for us in Heaven without us, are all ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, and if the Light within be ſufficient without all theſe, then there is no need to believe or Preach any of them, but only and alone the Light within.</p>
            <p>P. 24. He ſpends his Pages from 24. to 28. in ſome baſe inſinuations againſt me, about the 12 Revolutions, and telling ſome Stories, moſt of which are abſolutely falſe (and that little that's true, in any of them, is not fairly, nor duly related) and which he brought no proof for, but his own forfeited Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, or the report of ſuch as are of as ill Credit as himſelf, and known to have been prejudiced Perſons againſt me.</p>
            <p>P. 29. What he ſaith of my Praiſing the Quaker`s Doctrine to <hi>Cotton Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> was before that Party roſe up aginſt me in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> to oppoſe the ſame Doctrine I delivered in my Printed Books, in anſwer to <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> which Doctrine they ſeemed to own, and all my former Books were Approved of by moſt of the Miniſters of beſt note in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> that were writ, in Anſwer to <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> and his Brethren in <hi>New England,</hi> before they were Printed; ſo that it was a moſt aſtoniſhing thing to me to find how ſuddenly they who profeſſed to own the Doctrine contained in theſe Books, turned againſt the very ſame Doctrine, after <hi>W. Stockdale</hi> had accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, of Preaching two Chriſts, becauſe I Preached Faith in Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and in Chriſt within, therefore this ſudden Alteration began in them, and until I came to <hi>England,</hi> (and found the greateſt part of their Teachers here in <hi>England,</hi> and particularly <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> and <hi>W. Penn,</hi> to favour and ſupport thoſe in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> whom I have ſufficiently detected guilty of vile Errors) I had but too good an Eſteem for them, wherein I confeſs I was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken; and this put me on a further ſearch into their Books, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I did not much Read (and many of them not at all) and what I did Read, I did not ſo well conſider; and upon my further ſearch, I found ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47493:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cauſe to change my Judgment concerning theſe Men. But none can charge it on me, that either by word or writing I ever agreed with them in thoſe vile Errors, which ſince I have diſcovered and reprehended in them, ſo that this is no change or contradiction in any Doctrine or Principle of Faith, and what change of Judgment I have of theſe Men, they have the like of me, and will readily confeſs they have been as greatly miſtaken in me, as I have been in them; and therefore they can have no advantage againſt me in that reſpect.</p>
            <p>And whereas he Inſinuateth, pag. 24. 25, 26. That I have dropt here and there ſome paſſages in my late Books, from which they cannot but conclude, That either I did intend to conform Friends to ſome Doctrine, of which, by what follows, the Doctrine of the 12 Revolutions may be ſuppoſed to be not the leaſt in his Eye, or elſe to ſeparate from them. Some of which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions he mentions out of my late Books Printed in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> all which were generally approved by Friends of the Miniſtry, out of which he hath gathered them; and if he thinks theſe Expreſſions will prove the Doctrine of the 12 Revolutions, he ſhould have proved it by poſitive Arguments, and not give ſimple Queries for Arguments; all which I could eaſily Anſwer, without the Doctrine of the 12 Revolutions, but that I have no mind to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his curioſity, or gratify ſuch a prejudiced Adverſary; and he might much rather query, whether G. <hi>F.</hi> did not hold the Doctrine of the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that hath ſaid in ſome of his Printed Books, before Languages were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was; and his Charging the Blood of many that were ſlain above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years ago upon the People living in his time, in the City of <hi>Leichfield,</hi> as he declareth in his Journal, and how he went in Blood a great way, and was commanded to pull off his Shoes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This and ſome other like paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages has occaſioned ſome to think <hi>G. F.</hi> favoured the Revolutions, but I do not ſay he did. And whether the Diſciples did not hold that Doctrine, that ſaid, <hi>Maſter, who hath ſinned, this Man, or his Servants, that he was born blind;</hi> and many other places of Scripture there are on which he might as much and much more query concerning the Revolutions, as any expreſſions he hath mentioned of mine, as well as he might query, concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions, all Friends generally who hold, That God hath given to every one a day of Viſitation, wherein he may be ſaved, and that a Time of God's long ſuffering is extended to every one wherein he may repent and be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, ſeeing many Dye, in the Morning, as it were of their Age, without all ſigns of Converſion, and have had but little Time given them, between their Birth and Death, wherein to Repent. And as to his Queſtion, If an honeſt <hi>Indian,</hi> or Poor infant dye without that outward Knowledg, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He quite miſſeth the matter; <hi>I</hi> never affirmed the abſolute neceſſity of an outward Knowledg, univerſally to Salvation, beſides that, properly all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is inward, and not outward, the ſubject of it being the mind and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that is inward. And ſeeing it is certain, that there are honeſt men, both among <hi>Indians,</hi> and them called Chriſtians, that are not born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>I</hi> return his own Query upon him to Anſwer, what becomes of them
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47493:6"/>
when they dye, ſeeing without being born again, there is no entring into the Kingdom of God, and what becomes of many called Quakers, and others, that before they dyed, had no ſigns that they were arrived at that high ſtate of a ſinleſs perfection, for tho Friends have earneſtly contended for the Doctrin of Perfection, as attainable by the Grace of God in this Life, yet they have generally acknowledged, that many in whom the work of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is begun, have not as yet arrived to that ſtate, but have many ſinful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections remaining in them, and the Fleſh luſting againſt the Spirit; now let him tell me, or any for him, what becomes of ſuch when they Dye, and <hi>I</hi> may give him the like Anſwer, or ſome better, what becomes of honeſt <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> when they Dye, if he or they ſay, they who are in meaſure Sanctified, but not Perfected in Sanctification before they Dye, are made perfect in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs at the inſtant of Death, tho this Anſwer Friends have blamed, when given by thoſe againſt whom they have contended, yet if they think fit to allow of it, as current now, as it will in great part end the Diſpute about Perfection, and Anſwer the great Objection about the Popiſh Purgatory; ſo it is as valid to Anſwer that Queſtion, What becomes of honeſt Gentiles, that before they Died, had no Knowledg nor Faith of Chriſt Crucified, to wit, that it is given them at the inſtant of Death, by the internal Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and illumination of the Holy Spirit: But if any ſay, this Anſwer is more alledged than Proved, <hi>I</hi> reply, it hath the ſame probability in the one caſe, as in the other.</p>
            <p>P. 30. To prove my inconſiſtency and contrariety with my ſelf, in the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, with a moſt blaſphemous preſumption, he finds fault with Scripture Doctrine it ſelf, and like a ſcoffing Sadducy, or rather Atheiſt, goeth to fix a contradiction on the Scripture it ſelf; for thus he brings me in, contradicting my ſelf, that which riſeth is the mortal, that puts on immortality, and the corruptible which puts on incorruption; citing my Book, called, <hi>A Teſtimony against that abſurd Opinion,</hi> p. 3. But in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, p. 10. he citeth me, ſaying, <hi>The Fleſh that is mortal and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible is not that Fleſh that ſhall be raiſed up immortal and incorruptible.</hi> And citing my Book, called, <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> he brings me ſaying of that which riſeth, <hi>That it is a pure noble part, that conſumeth not, nor corrupteth.</hi> And then he querieth, If that which riſeth be the corruptible, p. 31. how is it, that that which riſeth is incorruptible and corrupteth not again? Now Reader, I deſire thee to notice how he quarrels not ſo much with me as with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to prove a contradiction in them, for my ſaying, <hi>That which riſeth is the Mortal that puts on Immortality, and the Corruptible that puts on Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> this is plain Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 53. <hi>For this Corruptible muſt put on Incorruption, and this Mortal muſt put on Immortality.</hi> And for the next Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which he makes a contradiction to the former; it is alſo moſt plain and evident in the Scripture, <hi>The Fleſh that is Mortal and Corruptible is not that Fleſh that ſhall be raiſed up Immortal and Incorruptible;</hi> for the Scripture ſaith <hi>Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 50. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that is the Fleſh that is Mortal and Corruptible. And p. 37. That which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47493:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thou ſoweſt, thou ſoweſt not that Body that ſhall be: And v. 42. <hi>It is ſown in Corruption, it is raiſed in Incorruption,</hi> &amp;c. And to his queſtion, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth a negation and oppoſition to plain Scripture; I anſwer, That which riſeth, is incorruptible, and corrupteth not again, becauſe it is made incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and immortal by the mighty Power of God, and to queſtion the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and incorruptibility of the Bodies of the Saints after they are raiſed from the Dead, is to ſuppoſe that they ſhall dye again, and has this neceſſary conſequence, that they ſhall ſin again, <hi>for the wages of ſin is Death:</hi> But this contradicts the Teſtimony of Chriſt, and all his Holy Prophets and Apoſtles, and is a plain Introduction to Epicuriſm and Atheiſm. And that I ſaid in my Book, <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> which he findeth fault with, as being a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that that which riſeth is a pure, noble part that conſumeth not, nor corrupteth. This I ſay ſtill, and is no contradiction; for in my Book in that very place cited by him. p. 113. I bring a ſimilitude of a grain of Corn, which very Similitude the Scripture bringeth, to demonſtrate the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 37. Now all but fools and idiots know, that as there is a Grain of Corn that corrupteth, and turneth to Earth or Duſt, ſo there is another part in it, that is more Noble, that corrupteth not, but by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and diſſolution of the other part, is, as it were, ſet out of Priſon, and gets a new Life and Multiplication, and as true Philoſophy and right Reaſon, and Ocular Experience teacheth, that the generation of one thing followeth the corruption of another, yet there is ſomething in the new gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated thing, that was in the old corrupted thing; ſo every Husbandman, that has common ſenſe, knoweth, that his Seed which he ſoweth, doth not all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh or rot in the ground, but a part remaineth in every Grain, that multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, except in ſome extraordinary caſe, of immoderate Rains and Colds, that altogether deſtroy the Seed in the ground, as ſometimes happeneth; and then he expects no Crop, unleſs he ſow again. And that this man will needs med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with Philoſophical matters, to confirm himſelf by falſe Notions in groſs Sadduciſm, and oppoſition to the plain Doctrine of Holy Scripture, is a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable caſe; and that he hath got the <hi>Second Days Weekly Meeting</hi> at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to approve his book, in order to diſperſe it all over the Meetings of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> to corrupt and leaven them more and more into Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciſm and unbelief, who have been in any degree formerly corrupted, as I find too many are; and to ſpoil and defile the minds of young People, is yet more lamentable.</p>
            <p>Page 32. He goeth on not ſo much in contending with me, as againſt the Scripture it ſelf. But that which ſeemeth mightily to vex and diſquiet his Thoughts, is, that he cannot conceive how there can be an incorruptible part lodged or placed in the corruptible body, and how the body can have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible part in it before the Reſurrection; for then he thinks it would be both corruptible and incorruptible at once; and alſo it needs not be changed from an incorruptible body to an incorruptible body? And what change is that? I queſtion if any <hi>Sadducee</hi> did ever argue ſo ignorantly againſt the Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body as this bold ignorant doth. Shall I ſend him to his Mill, or own Trade of grinding, or ſawing Timber, for further inſtruction? Doth he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47493:7"/>
not know that Corn hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> two parts in it, the one Husk, the other Meal? And hath not a Tree in it two parts, the one Wood, the other Bark? And is not the one more Noble than the other? And when a man eateth Corn with the Husk, and ſwalloweth down at leaſt a good quantity of the Husk or Bran, together with the Food that is mixed with it, doth the Husk become any part of his body? or, rather, doth it not belong to the Excrement, with other groſs parts of the food? Is there not in all food one more Noble part that becometh not Excrement, but is tranſmuted into real fleſh, in man? And did not what our Saviour eat, turn into his real fleſh, and become incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſeeing his fleſh ſaw no corruption? And was not his body of fleſh, that did not ſee corruption, yet further changed, after his Reſurrection and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, from a lower degree to a higher degree of Glory? Bus if it were not for the ſake of others, to whom I hope this may be ſerviceable, I ſhould think my time loſt to trace this ignorant man, that is ſo ſtubborn and preſumptuous in his ignorance, (and it might ſeem like caſting Pearl before Swine) that ſo dares to tread under his dirty feet, ſuch precious Truths of Scripture. But I hope what he arrogantly treads under, and his ignorant <hi>Sadducean</hi> Fraternity with him, others will gather up, and value, for the worth of them. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Scripture Similitude of Corn, I brought another Similitude in that ſame Page of my book, p. 113. comparing the mortal and corruptible body of man to a Maſs, or Mixture, that hath both Gold and Droſs in it, which Maſs is an Heterogeneous body, and is not pure Gold. And though Gold is not in the higheſt or ſtricteſt ſenſe incorruptible, yet it is the moſt incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of all Metals or Minerals, or other ſuch viſible bodies; and therefore in compariſon of many other bodies, it may be ſaid to be incorruptible. Now why may it not be ſaid, of a Maſs that hath both Gold and Droſs in it, it is a corruptible body; for all Heterogeneous bodies are corruptible; and yet it hath that in it which in a certain reſpect is incorruptible; for we know not any thing that can corrupt it, ſeeing it endureth the hotteſt fire that can be put to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 33. My Similitude taken from the Soul of Man, that remains the ſame in ſubſtance, after its ſanctification, that it was before, when unſanctified, and defiled with ſin, he ſaith, is ſhort of the matter; for ſuch a change is ſurely rather a <hi>purification</hi> than a <hi>tranſmutation,</hi> even as the waſhing of a body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared with dirt, when cleanſed, is a <hi>purification,</hi> and not a <hi>tranſmutation.</hi> But ſtill this ignorant preſumptuous man runs himſelf raſhly upon the ſharp pricks. Formerly he hath laboured in vain to deſtroy the felicity of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of a Saint, and now he laboureth as much in vain to deſtroy the felicity of his Soul; that he makes the <hi>work of Regeneration in the Soul of Man,</hi> to be nothing elſe but a <hi>purification from ſin,</hi> as when a Body beſmeared with dirt, is cleanſed, that is a Purification, and not a Tranſmutation. I never heard, nor read a more ignorant and nonſenſical Aſſertion. This is like that other moſt nonſenſical Aſſertion of one of their great Preachers here at <hi>London, Jacob Talner,</hi> and a Member of their Second Days Meeting, who ſaid in a publick Conference at <hi>Turner</hi>'s<hi>-Hall, London,</hi> 28. 3d. month, 1696. deſired
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47493:7"/>
by himſelf, <hi>That</hi> Adam, <hi>before his Fall, was neither Holy, nor Righteous, nor Wiſe;</hi> and from this Falſe Aſſertion, he brought an Argument, <hi>That Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Death could not be an effect of</hi> Adam's <hi>Sin:</hi> Both which Aſſertions are flatly contrary, not only to Scripture, but to the common manner of Preaching among the People called Quakers; and this he boldly affirmed in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome hundreds, many of which were his own Party. What is this but to make the Souls of the Saints, nothing but as ſo many <hi>Tabulae Raſae,</hi> waſhed Tables without any Beautiful Colours, or lively Portraiture on them? Is then the Image of God in the Saints no poſitive thing, but a Freedom from ſin, or a Negation of it. Is Holyneſs nothing but a Negation of unholineſs? Is the ardent Love of God in the Saints nothing, but a meer negative of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of God? Doth not the Scripture plainly diſtinguiſh betwixt the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tranſgreſſion, and bringing in everlaſting Righteouſneſs? O wrerched ignorance! And O lamentable ſhame that falls upon the Second Days week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meeting of the People called Quakers, for approving ſuch Antichriſtian Doctrine, worſe than Heatheniſm; for I never heard that ever any Heathen Philoſopher ſaid or taught, <hi>That Virtue in the Soul of a Man, was nothing but the abſence of Vice.</hi> The Holy Scripture doth not only Teach us, <hi>That the Saints are waſhed, but Sanctified, and Transformed,</hi> Rom. 12. 2. And what is now become of <hi>G. Foxes</hi> frequent Doctrine in his Preaching, and Printed Epiſtles, <hi>That Christ, the Second</hi> Adam, <hi>brings up them that follow him, not only to the state of the Firſt</hi> Adam <hi>that fell, but unto his Image that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fell, and is the Holineſs of the Second</hi> Adam, <hi>nothing but a freedom from ſin and unholineſs;</hi> he may as well ſay, Heat is nothing but the abſence of cold, Sweet is nothing but the abſence of Sower, or Bitter; Light is nothing but the abſence of Darkneſs, and that the beſt things, are meer Negatives, and nonentities; and the putting on the New Man, is nothing elſe but the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the Old Man; and ſo at this rate the Scripture is vain and falſe, which doth diſtinguiſh them, as much as betwixt the putting off a filthy Garment, and the putting on a new clean Garment? But if on better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, he be aſhamed of his raſh Aſſertion, and come to acknowledg that the Soul by Regeneration, not only is purified from Sin, but wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully changed and transformed, from Natural or Animal, to Spiritual, from Earthly to Heavenly, and yet the ſame in Subſtance; let him acknowledg that the mighty Power of God, through Chriſt, that thus hath changed the Soul, retaining the ſame ſubſtance, can and will change the low Body of a Saint, and faſhion it like the Glorious Body of Chriſt, as the Scripture plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Teſtifieth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>P. 34. But nothing will ſatisfy him, unleſs I can demonſtrate how a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Corruptible Subſtance can be turned into a Spiritual one. Well, if I can demonſtrate that this actually was done, will that ſatisfy him? I fear his unbelief will ſtill harden his Heart againſt this excellent Doctrine of holy Scripture. But however, I will try a little more to Convince him. The Food which our Saviour received into his Body, was it not before he received it, corruptible, or to uſe his Phraſe, a Corruptible Natural Subſtance? Yea,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47493:8"/>
ſurely it was, and what part of that Food became part of his Body and Fleſh, it was turned or changed into incorruptible, for as his Fleſh ſaw no Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo without all doubt it is at preſent an incorruptible Subſtance, which <hi>G. W.</hi> after his former wrangling hath acknowledged, <hi>Malice of the Indepen.</hi> Agent, p. 17.</p>
            <p>P. 34. His wrangling and quibling from his own groſs miſunderſtanding of ſome places of Scripture, helps him nothing, as that <hi>David ſlept with his Faethers, and ſaw Corruption,</hi> Acts 13. 36. And that of <hi>Job, I have ſaid of Corruption, thou art my Father.</hi> If he will take theſe Scriptures ſtrictly and literally, he muſt as much contend againſt the Immortality of the Soul, as the Reſurrection of the Body; the Mortal Body of Man is truly ſaid to be Corruptible, becauſe it conſiſts of two heterogeneous parts, the one Noble, the other ignoble, to wit, the Husk, Droſs, or Cortex, and after the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Noble, from the Ignoble, it is not corrupt, but pure, yet at the Reſurrection it is raiſed up to an higher Dignity, and made immortal and incorruptible, as it neither ſhall, nor can return to be united with that droſſy part again, and ſo is truly incorruptible, as well as immortal.</p>
            <p>But he will not leave off, until, as the Man-Eater, or <hi>Anthropophagus,</hi> eateth Mans Fleſh, he Eat or ſwallow up (with his devouring Throat, thereby thinking to deſtroy it) the Doctrine of the Reſurrection of the Body. And he joyneth with <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Sadducees</hi> here in arguing againſt the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body (being the ſame in Subſtance) from the Man-Eaters. And to my Anſwer to their Objection from the Man-Eaters, he Replyeth, firſt, Repeating ſome of my words, but omitting the Explanatory part, I ſhall therefore cite them as they are in my Book, p. 118. <hi>Truth Adv.</hi> I ſay, <hi>Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is a great change, or renewing of the groſs material and viſible Parts of Mans Body, yet the Radical Body, or Radix, and Principal Subſtance of the Body remaineth the ſame, and is of a durable and laſting Nature; and tho it may be encreaſed in Man, while he liveth, yet it is not diminiſhed, nor the parts of it ſeparated aſunder; and tho Man-Eaters may Eat the groſs part of Man's Body, yet that more ſubtil and inviſible part they cannot, nor can that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to one be given to another; hence by way of Allegory and Metaphor, it is called Bone in Scripture,</hi> Iſa. 66. 14. From this, moſt nonſenſically he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, That I affirm, the Man-eaters Eat the Accidents of Man's Body, but not the Subſtance, and will needs have it the ſame, or equally abſurd with the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation. But this ſort of quibling comes partly from his groſs ignorance, and partly from the perverſion and prejudice of his Spirit, for I neither ſaid, nor thought that the Man-Eaters eat only the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, but I diſtinguiſhed betwixt the Radix and principal Subſtance of Man's Body, and that which was but the droſſy part, which is alſo a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and if he deny it to be a ſubſtance, to wit, the Droſs or Droſſy part of any Body, which is frequently ſeparated from the Noble Volatile part, by Chimical Operations, and otherwiſe, he is guilty of the Popiſh falſe Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Tranſubſtantiation, and not I, for the Droſs is frequently ſeparated from that more Noble Subſtance, that it was mingled with; and if he ſays that Droſs is not a Subſtance, but an Accident, then here is the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47493:8"/>
Popiſh Doctrine affirmed by him, with a witneſs! But let this Miller-Philoſopher, (who, as the Shooemaker, goeth beyond his Laſt, ſo goeth beyond his Sphere of Knowledge, in all his undertaking againſt theſe great Truths of the Chriſtian Faith) tell me, doth he think that a Man-eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er can, properly ſpeaking, eat Iron, Silver, Gold, Lead: if he ſwallow it down, will it not go forth at the draught with the Excrement, and yet is no part of the Excrement? This is a thing uſually known, that ſome, to ſave their Gold from Robbers, have ſwallowed it down; but did they eat it? If he ſay, nay; then I ſay to him, no more can a man-eater eat that radical and principal ſubſtance of a Saints body, to make it a part of his body; for as every body has a diſtinct ſeed, ſo the Radix of every body is a diſtinct Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix.</p>
            <p>P. 36. But behold the man's great hypocriſie, after all his ſo much conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt the Reſurrection of the Body, and charging the Scripture it ſelf with inconſiſtency and contradiction, yet he has the impudence to ſay, we firmly <hi>believe there ſhall be a Reſurrection both of the Juſt and Unjuſt.</hi> And again he ſaith, <hi>We do not think it a neceſſary buſineſs to be curiouſly prying into the manner of it; Neither,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>do we find the Primitive Chriſtians come to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reſult about what their Bodies ſhould be.</hi> But this is a plain Contradiction to the holy Scripture, That the Primitive Chriſtians believed, and all true Chriſtians do now believe, which ſaith, <hi>This corrrptible ſhall put on incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this mortal ſhall put on immortality.</hi> Now what is this mortal? It is not the Soul which he thinks (I ſuppoſe) is not mortal; therefore it muſt be the Body. And concerning the manner of it, the Scripture is very plain and expreſs, <hi>It is ſown natural, it is raiſed ſpiritual; it is ſown in corruption, it is raiſed in incorruption; it is ſown in weakneſs, it is raiſed in power; it is ſown in diſhonour, it is raiſed in honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. 36. But he goeth on ſtill, querying, 1. <hi>If it was the common belief of the Primitive Chriſtians, that the very ſame matter and ſubſtance of this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible body, ſhould be the body that is raiſed, why ſhould any among themſelves, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, have asked ſuch a needleſs queſtion, as with what Body do they come?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Such who asked that Queſtion, were ſuch among them, that ſaid, there was no Reſurrection of the Dead, as ſuch there were, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12. <hi>How ſay ſome among you, there is no Reſurrection of the Dead?</hi> And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> thought it not needleſs to propoſe their Queſtion, on purpoſe to anſwer it; and that he might take occaſion thereby the more fully and amply to declare it.</p>
            <p>His ſecond Queſtion is, <hi>Would not the Apoſtle have anſwered more to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?</hi> I anſwer, He anſwered very well to the matter, after he had reproved them as Fools, for querying from their unbelief, and their ignorant manner of arguing againſt it, as many do at this day, he proceeds to ſhow the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how it is raiſed, having in the foregoing Verſes proved the Truth of the Thing, he doth next ſhow the manner of it; and the Queſtion which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, is not concerning what is raiſed, or who are raiſed, but how are the Dead raiſed, and with what manner, or with what quality of body do they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47493:9"/>
come; ſo the trueſt, and beſt Tranſlation out of the <hi>Greek,</hi> which hath it not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>i. e.</hi> not <hi>quo corpore, ſed quali corpore;</hi> not with what, but with what quality of body do they come? But this their querying was a ſort of arguing againſt the thing it ſelf, of the Reſurrection. And by an Argument which they thought to take from the manner of it, they argued againſt the thing it ſelf, even as the <hi>Sadducees</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued with Chriſt againſt the Reſurrection, from the falſe conceit of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, that they had, as if the Body were to be raiſed up in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as it is now, ſo as to be fit for generation, and the uſe of marriage, which Chriſt confuted; ſo many at this day, and eſpecially this <hi>Sadducy, Caleb Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> and his <hi>Sadducean</hi> Fraternity in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and here in <hi>England</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, they argue againſt the Reſurrection of the Body it ſelf, from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, as thus, If the ſame body for ſubſtance ſhall be raiſed, then it muſt be raiſed, for manner, ſuch as it is now, but that is impoſſible. Now the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle anſwers, by donying, that it ſhall be raiſed in the ſame manner, but it ſhall quite be changed and transformed, not tranſubſtantiated, from mortal and corruptible, and Natural or Animal, to immortal, incorruptible and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. Oh, ſay they, this connot be, this would be a Tranſubſtantiation, like that of the Papiſts. But I ſay, this <hi>Caleb Puſie,</hi> and his Fraternity, that profeſs to hold a Reſurrection of the body, but not of that ſame ſubſtance, fall in with the Popiſh Tranſubſtantion; for Tranſubſtantiation is a change of a thing from one ſubſtance to another, as the Papiſts ſay; and therefore <hi>Caleb Puſie,</hi> and his brethren, who deny that the body is the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but changed from one ſubſtance to another, are clearly one with the Papiſts, in their abſurd Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation: And thus the Pit he and his <hi>Saddueean</hi> brethren have digged for me, he and they are fallen into both together.</p>
            <p>And it is manifeſt Hypocriſie in <hi>Caleb Puſie</hi> and his brethren, for him and them to ſay, they think it not neceſſary to be curiouſly prying into the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, when they are moſt abſurd in determining the manner of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all Scripture and Reaſon. For they will needs have it, that the change is a change of the ſubſtance, and not of the Quality and Condition: The Body, ſay they, that the dead are raiſed with, is another body in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſo they will needs have it. But then let him tell us, when the deceaſed Saints get this other body, that is another in ſubſtance: I ſuppoſe he will ſay with his brethren, in the ſame ignorance and unbelief, <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> that they get it immediately after Death; for they both argue againſt the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Saints expecting any Reſurrection of the body, that this implies the Soul to be in a kind of Purgatory or Diſquietneſs, till the ſuppoſed Reſumption of the body.</p>
            <p>Page 41. He chargeth <hi>G. K.</hi> to be guilty of belying the Magiſtrates at <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,</hi> Printing, That the Magiſtrates not only countenanced the hiring men to fight, but alſo gave them a Commiſſion ſo to do, ſigned by Three Juſtices of Peace, whereof one was a Preacher, citing Appeal from the 28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And from thence he juſtifieth their Perſecution againſt <hi>G. K.</hi> in fining him Five
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47493:9"/>
Pounds. But now how he proves this to be falſe, firſt, he ſaith, it was more than they had power to do, being Civil Magiſtrates. But this is no Proof; for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men, ſuch as they were, might go beyond their power. However, he grants, if it was not a Commiſſion, it was a Warrant of a <hi>Hue and Cry,</hi> ſigned but by Two Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of Peace, and neither of them a Preacher. But what Proof brings he for this? None but his bare Affirmation. But ſo it was, that ſome of them who received the Commiſſion, told us, it was a Commiſſion ſigned by Three Juſtices, whereof one of them was a Preacher. And when this very matter was debated before the Yearly Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at <hi>London,</hi> 3d mo. 1694. <hi>Samuel Jennings</hi> pretending it was not a Commiſſion, but a <hi>Hue and Cry, Thomas Lower</hi> contradicted it in my hearing, and the hearing of many others, ſaying, it could be no <hi>Hue and Cry,</hi> for no <hi>Hue and Cry</hi> had any power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend beyond dry Land; but this was to go to the Water, which I leave to men better skill'd in Law to determine: However, whether a Commiſſion, or <hi>Hue and Cry,</hi> which is but a Nicety of Phraſe in Politicks and worldly Government, it confirms the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what was affirmed, That <hi>ſome Quakers ſigned a Paper, commanding and giving power to men, by Force of Arms, to retake a Sloop;</hi> which is ſufficiently known to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the profeſſed principles of the Quakers here in <hi>England,</hi> who have witneſſed by divers Printed Books and Teſtimonies, That they are againſt all uſe of Carnal Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, ſo much as in ſelf-defence, and have declared againſt Ship-maſters, that were Quakers, their carrying Arms, ſo much as in ſelf-defence.</p>
            <p>Page 41. Another falſhood he chargeth on <hi>G. K.</hi> is, That he ſaid, <hi>the Ministers there,</hi> viz. <hi>in</hi> Penſilvania. <hi>bad ingroſſed the Worldly Government.</hi> And this he offereth to prove to be falſe, for there were many that were not Miniſters, nor Quakers nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then in the Government. But this he only ſaith, and it is a notorious Falſhood, well known to them that lived there; for on the contrary, very few, but <hi>Quakers,</hi> were Magiſtrates, and for moſt part Preachers, and theſe few that were not <hi>Quakers,</hi> nor Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, they were but as meer Cyphers, the Miniſters ruled all, and did all, and the ſmall number of the reſt ſignified nothing, in that properly called the Province of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania;</hi> and Miniſters were not only juſtices, but Criminal Judges, a thing no where ſo practiſed, that I know, any where in Chriſtendom beſide. But however, whether <hi>G. K.</hi> was rightly informed in theſe Particulars, or not, that was not the Thing he was fined for, but for calling <hi>Sam. Jennings,</hi> an ignorant, preſumptuous and inſolent man, and ſaying, he was too high and imperious in worldly Courts. And this was and is well known to be a Truth; And he ſince remains ſufficiently under that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
            <p>And have not many called <hi>Quakers,</hi> uſed greater liberty than all this, to reprove the Pride of greater Men in Magiſtracy here in <hi>England</hi> in Times paſt, under their ſharp Perſecutions? And for a witneſs to it, let the Trial of <hi>William Penn</hi> and <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Mead,</hi> Printed at <hi>London,</hi> declare, as well as other Printed Trials and Books, not a few. But it is but waſte of Time and Paper to anſwer to all his Impertinencies. One thing is greatly worth noticing, That though theſe men ſhowed great warmth to fine, impriſon, and otherwſe proſecute, for ſome pretended Offences againſt them, that were (had they been real) but ſmall, and had better become them to have paſſed them by, being not againſt them as Magiſtrates, but as <hi>Quakers</hi> and Neighbours; Yet they did not only tolerate, but ſupport and countenance Perſons guilty of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Speeches againſt both God and Chriſt, and with an unbounded Liberty, did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe me in particular, as well as my Friends, one of them in a publick Meeting calling me, <hi>Wicked Fellow,</hi> another calling me <hi>Ranter, wicked Man,</hi> while I was in Prayer on my Knees, in the Meeting. And though they would not allow us to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47493:10"/>
them, as being <hi>Quakers</hi> and Magiſtrates, yet they did ſo diſtinguiſh, when they told us, They were not for fighting, as <hi>Quakers,</hi> but as Magiſtrates, which how apt and proper a diſtinction it was for them to uſe, I leave to the intelligent to judge.</p>
            <p>Page 46. He ſaith, <hi>Now to be plain, This is to ſhew, That</hi> G. K. <hi>may be (as well as others have been) a man of great Knowledge in Chronology, yet being led by a Wrong Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, what doth it profit?</hi> But how hath he proved, that <hi>G.</hi> K. is a man of a Wrong Spirit? What One Evil Thing hath he proved againſt me in all his book, either in Doctrine or Converſation? I know none: Though I have proved him guilty of many. And taking it for granted, That <hi>G.</hi> K. on extraordinary great Provocations and Abuſes, did drop, once or twice, ſome unadviſed (yet true) Expreſſions, doth this prove him to be a man of a Wrong Spirit? He hath been more ingenuous than all his Adverſaries, who have far exceeded him in heat and hard words, to acknowledge it, which I never knew that any of them did.</p>
            <p>Page 47. He pretends he has got a great Advantage againſt me, upon the Account of a Citation out of my book, called, <hi>Truths Defence,</hi> page 169. which he recites, though not ſo truly, as is in my book. But however, as it is, I agree to it, as to matter and ſubſtance. And though he ſaith, Page 53. That they do not queſtion that in the leaſt, that <hi>G.</hi> K. is of another mind now. It is a falſe Inſinuation, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the ſame mind ſtill, That I would have nothing urged, nor preſſed as Articles of Faith, but what is delivered to us in plain expreſs Scripture-words (which is the ſubſtance of that large Citation). And it is as falſe in him to ſay, That this was ſo often deſired, but could not find place, <hi>viz</hi> to take their Confeſſion in expreſs words, for this we never refuſed: but I ſaid again and again, <hi>We ſhall take your Confeſſion in Scripture-words</hi> (as many can bear me witneſs), <hi>provided ye will condemn your Errors that are contrary either to expreſs Scripture-words, or to the plain and manifeſt Senſe of them, obvious to every intelligent Chriſtian.</hi> But this they would never do. And whereas he querieth, <hi>How know we that they have a Senſe contrary to Scripture-words?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, They have ſufficiently diſcovered it, not only by One or Two unſound Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, but multitudes of them, as their Letters, and Manuſcripts there, and the Printed Books here, ſufficiently prove; And we need go no further for a Proof, than the moſt groſs and Antichriſtian Expreſſions and Sayings of <hi>Caleb Puſie</hi> himſelf, in this very Treatiſe. For whereas he hath plainly affirmed, p. 15. <hi>ad finem, That Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>cannot be ſomething elſe than the Light, Power and Spirit within.</hi> Now can there be any thing more contrary to expreſs Scripture, than this Aſſertion? Was not Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> a real man, conſiſting of Soul and Body, in whom the fullneſs of the Godhead dwelt bodily, and who, <hi>above meaſure, was filled with all fullneſs of Grace and Truth:</hi> And is that Body, and that Soul, and that Fullneſs, nothing elſe but the Light within us? Oh, Abominable Nonſenſe, and Perverſion, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to Scripture, and all true Reaſon! He may as much ſay, The great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of water in the Ocean, with the Channels and Places that receive it, is nothing elſe than the River <hi>Thames,</hi> and that little narrow Tract of Earth in which it runs. And at this Rate, whatever is declared of Chriſt, as born at <hi>Bethlem,</hi> or converſing with his Diſciples in <hi>Judea, teaching them, and working mighty Signs and Miracles among them;</hi> And laſtly, Crucified on the Tree of the Croſs at <hi>Golgotha,</hi> muſt be underſtood of nothing elſe but the Light, Power and Spirit within. If this be not as great and groſs Ranteriſm as ever was among men. I leave all ſober Chriſtians to Judge. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſeeing he pretends ſo much to expreſs Scripture, let him tell me, 1. Where doth the Scripture ſay, That <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is nothing elſe than the Light, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Spirit within?

Antichriſt's Bible it may be found, and is found. 2. Where doth the Scripture ſay, That the Light within is ſufficient to ſalvation, without any thing elſe? or that it is an Error to ſay, The Light within is not ſufficient to ſalvation, without ſomething elſe? Which Two being contradictory, if the one be falſe, the other muſt be true. <hi>3dly,</hi> Where doth the Scripture ſay, it is ſufficient to Eternal Salvation, only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and obey the Light within, without all Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and raiſed again, ſeeing the Scripture, plain contrarywiſe makes it the Terms of Salvation, in great part, to confeſs with the <hi>mouth, and believe with the heart, that God hath raiſed Jeſus from the Dead,</hi> Rom. 10. 9, 10. <hi>4thly,</hi> Where doth the Scripture ſay, The Blood that was ſhed without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is not that Blood whereby we are juſtified, which was <hi>John Humphreys</hi> Aſſertion, a Miniſter in <hi>Penſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> which we could never get him, nor any of you all, to condemn; and no wonder; for <hi>G. W.</hi> in his book, <hi>Light and Life,</hi> hath ſaid as much. <hi>5thly,</hi> Where doth the Scripture ſay, The bodies of the Saints, at the Reſurrection, ſhall be other bodies in ſubſtance, from what they were here on Earth, which this <hi>Caleb Puſie</hi> hath affirmed 6<hi>thly,</hi> Where doth the Scripture ſay, The Regeneration, or Converſion of the Soul, is only a purification from ſin, as the waſhing of a body beſmeared with dirt, when cleanſed, is a Purification, and not a Tranſmutation, as <hi>Caleb Puſey</hi> hath alſo affirmed, as above? And though I remain ſtill in the ſame mind, That no Article of Faith ſhould be urged on any but what is contained in plain expreſs words of Scripture, (or ſo agreeable to expreſs Scripture, as the common ſenſe of all mankind, that hears Scripture words, muſt acknowledge, as though it is not ſaid, in Scriptures, That <hi>Egypt, Arabia, Paleſtine, Meſopotamia,</hi> are Places without us, yet common, Senſe tells us ſo); Yet I ſee not why I ſhould be ſo confined to expreſs Scripture words in things that I require no Man to own or believe, as Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, but leave them to their Liberty, and others take their Liberty to uſe great variety of other words; and I think I may ſay it without vanity, the manner of my Preaching and writing has been full as much Scriptural, as to Phraſe, as moſt of the Preachers and Writers among the Quakers.</p>
            <p>As for his querying, pag. 56. where are the expreſs Scripture words that ſay, <hi>The four hundred pieces of Silver that</hi> Abraham <hi>Purchaſed the Burying Place with, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies four hundred Vertues.</hi> I Anſwer, The Scripture ſaith that as much, though not expreſly, yet implicitly, as it ſaith, The Treaſures we are to lay up in Heaven. are Spiritual and Divine Vertues, which are the true Riches, and the Wells that <hi>Abraham</hi> Digged, and <hi>Iſaack,</hi> ſignified the Spiritual Wells of Water within them; and <hi>Egypt</hi> ſignified the power of Darkneſs, and <hi>Canaan</hi> that ſlowed with Milk and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſignified the Kingdom of God, for the Old Teſtament abounds with ſuch Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories. But if any do not believe my interpretation by way of Allegory on that place of Scripture (while they and I own the literal Senſe) or any others of the like nature, I am far from urging it upon them, but leave them to their free Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as God ſhall be pleaſed to Enlighten them. For there are many things both in my Book, called, <hi>Truth Advanced</hi> (ſo reproachfully mentioned by him) and in many other of my Books, wherein I may poſſibly differ from others in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet I leave them to their Liberty to Diſſent, as I deſire to be left to my Liberty, to believe as I judg God has perſwaded me. But ſuch as differ from me, ſo far, and ſo wide, as this Perſon doth, <hi>Caleb Puſie,</hi> and theſe of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Days Meeting, that have Countenanced and Approved his moſt Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrines, directly contrary to the great fundamentals of Chriſtianity, affirming Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be nothing elſe but the Light within; and ſaying,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47493:12"/>
The Light within is ſufficient to Salvation, without any thing elſe; ſo Exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> his Death, and Sufferings, his Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, Mediation for us in Heaven; all which are ſomething elſe than the Light within, from being concerned in our Salvation, I can by no means own them to be my Chriſtian Brethren, but eſteem them to be worſe than <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi> and than other Sober and Honeſt Heathens or Gentiles, for their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſo great Truths ſo plainly expreſt in Holy Scripture; and it is not the Light in them, but groſs Darkneſs that leads them into theſe abominable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and the very Spirit of Antichriſt Poſſeſſes them, and they are ſuch Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts, concerning whom <hi>John</hi> Teſtified, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 18. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 9. 3. <hi>Every Spirit that Confeſſeth not that Ieſus Christ is come in the Fleſh, is not of God.</hi> And this is that Spirit of Antichriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For notwithſtanding their ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions to him, yet ſeeing they own not Juſtification by his Blood outwardly ſhed, and Salvation by Faith in him, as he Dyed for us, and Roſe again, their Faith and Confeſſion is vain, and Hypocritical.</p>

            <p>Pag. 3. THeir blaming me for appointing a Meeting, to which their Conſent was neither ſought, nor made Neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They got timely Notice a Month before-hand, and were deſired to be preſent and why might not I appoint a Meeting without their Conſent, to Detect their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and to ſhow the Unjuſtneſs of their Sentence of Excommunication againſt me, as without my Conſent, they appointed a Meeting to Excommunicate me; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them again and again in former Prints to conſent to Time and Place; yea, to appoint Time and Place, and I ſhould ſtand to their Appointment; But they ſtill refuſed, <hi>Offenders uſe not to conſent to their Tryal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. 3. Their charging me with Spleen and Malice. I reject as falſe and fictitious.</p>
            <p>P. 4. Their telling of two Books lying on my Hand unanſwered, and my having given them Ground to expect an Anſwer to two of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To the firſt, ſome of their own Church have ſufficiently anſwered, to ſhow the Badneſs of their Cauſe, in that Cenſure they gave againſt <hi>Thomas Elwood,</hi> which was read at the Meeting at <hi>Turner's-Hall,</hi> 11th. of the 4th. Month. 1696. and is Printed in the <hi>Exact Narrative,</hi> pag. 46. To the ſecond, and all the other I anſwered at that Meeting, and have ſufficiently detected their Abuſes, Fallacies, Perverſions, as well as Falſe Doctrines; though I have a great deal more in reſerve. But all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Men will clear me of any blame, in not anſwering them in Print, when I have offered to Anſwer them <hi>viva voce,</hi> at a Meeting; for there is no end of anſwering them in Print; and they can, and do more ſecurely Forge, Pervert, and Abuſe their Readers and me alſo, in Print, becauſe they know few will be at the pains to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their Books with mine, to ſee who is innocent or blame-worthy: But Face to Face, and by Word of Mouth, it is eaſily made apparent; and beſide, as I have formerly told, to print Books to anſwer all their Books, is too great a Charge for me.</p>
            <p>P. 4. They alledge, 'I have vindicated their Principles from their Common Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Such as I did think were their Principles, I did formerly vindicate; but moſt of them, which I did think were their Principles, I have found of late were not their Principles, though I retain them ſtill as mine; and I challenge them, or any Man, to prove, that ever I did vindicate any of theſe four abominable Principles, which I have proved <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> guilty of at the late Meeting, 11th. 4th Month, 1696. and whereof the late Printed <hi>Narrative</hi> gives an Account And though they alledge, I have changed my Principles, yet they have not made it to appear, nor I believe they ever ſhall, that in any one Article of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> that are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among the <hi>Simpliciter credenda,</hi> I have changed any one Principle, Only as to the Senſe of ſome Places of Scripture, relating to <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> I own I have changed my Mind, but to the better; and alſo as to ſome other places of Scripture, improperly alledged to prove ſome real Truths.</p>
            <p>P. 4. to p. 10. As concerning theſe ſeveral Teſtimonies they bring out of my Books in all theſe pages, I own every one of them ſtill, as things ſincerely believed by me,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47493:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and I believe by many others alſo, ſo far as they relate to Doctrine But that I held them forth as the Principles of the Teachers among the Quakers univerſally, or as the Principles of <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. Penn,</hi> ſeeing I have ſince found them ſo palbably to contradict them in their Printed Books, <hi>I</hi> freely acknowledge my ſhortneſs and miſtake therein. But they moſt uncharitably alledge, That it is hardneſs in me, to have changed my Opinion, or Perſwaſion of theſe men, ſeeing they have given me ſo great and juſt occaſion ſo to do, by boldly defending and excuſing theſe vile Errors.</p>
            <p>The next thing they charge me with, is my Inconſiſtency and Self-contradiction; but this is a Falſe Charge, their manifeſt failure in their undertaking will ſufficiently, I hope prove. The firſt Self-contradiction they think they have catched me in, is what they bring in <hi>pag.</hi> 111, 2. viz. That I ſaid, <hi>(Nameleſs Bull,</hi> pag. 11.) <q>Seeing this true Faith is wrought in God's ordinary way by Preaching, therefore the true Faith of Chriſt's Death and Sufferings ought to be one of the firſt and chiefeſt things that every true Miniſter ought to Preach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> But they think I contradict this, <hi>[Way to the City of God,</hi> pag. 3.] <q>The knowledge of his inward coming, is that which is the more needful, and in the firſt place, as being that by which the true and comfortable uſe of his outward coming is alone ſufficiently underſtood.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As I have ſomewhere elſe ſaid, It is my Lot to have to do with Men, that have neither ſo much true Logick, nor Common Senſe, as to underſtand what a true Contradiction is. Let any Man of common ſenſe judge, if it be a contradiction, or leaſt inconſiſtency to ſay, <hi>The true Faith of Chriſts Death is one of the firſt things that ought to be Preached, to bring Men to witneſs the true Faith of Chriſts Death, and being made Conformable to his Death:</hi> And alſo to ſay, <hi>The knowledge of his inward coming is the more needful in the firſt place:</hi> As it is no contradiction to ſay <hi>George Whitehead</hi> was one of the firſt Quakers in the North of <hi>England; George Fox</hi> was the firſt Quaker. But for the better underſtanding of the Caſe, the diſtinction betwixt <hi>general Religion</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, (which diſtinction I have uſed in my Book, called <hi>Divine immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Inſpiration continued in the true Church,</hi> Printed at <hi>London,</hi> 1684. and which was read and approved by the Second Days Meeting, when I was preſent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore G. W. is bound to own what is in that Book, unleſs he will ſay, their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are changed in their Principles) ſee <hi>pag.</hi> 44. where I alſo diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>general Revelation</hi> in Men, and <hi>ſpecial;</hi> the <hi>general</hi> I ſaid was common to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the <hi>ſpecial</hi> given to true Chriſtians. By <hi>general Revelation,</hi> (which is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon illumination given to all Mankind, men are taught to know that God is, and that he is the maker of all things, and that he hath given a Law to Men, in their Hearts, which they are to obey; and when they diſobey this Law, they make themſelves guilty before God; and by this <hi>general Revelation,</hi> or illumination, Men generally know that they are Sinners, all having ſinned; and by this inward Law, and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, common to all men, is the knowledge of Sin, and of the Wrath of God, that is due for Sin: and by this General or Common illumination, many of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> came ſo far as the Servants ſtate, and had acceptance with God as Servants, but were ſhort of the ſtate of Sons. becauſe they had not the Faith in Chriſt Crucified, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26. This ſame diſtinction of <hi>general</hi> and <hi>ſpecial</hi> Revelation, in other terms I held forth in my Book of <hi>Univerſal Grace,</hi> approved alſo by the Second Days Meeting and Printed in the Year 1671. which is about 25 Years ago; ſee pag. 8, 9, 10. of that Book, where I largely treat of a twofold inward Appearance of Chriſt in Men, the firſt and ſecond, and how the firſt prepareth for the ſecond; and how the firſt is not to be reſted in, but that we ought to preſs forward into the ſecond, <hi>pag.</hi> 9. <hi>ad finitum.</hi> And I ſaid, the firſt was that of the Law, the ſecond that of the Goſpel, <hi>pag.</hi> 8 The former that of the firſt Covenant, the latter that of the ſecond Covenant. And I ſay expreſly, <hi>pag.</hi> 8. 'The Goſpel lay hid within the Law, as within a Vail,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47493:14"/>
which the outward Tabernacle did plainly figure and hold forth: And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I have held forth this diſtinction in Print 25 Years ago, yet many of my preſent Adverſaries cry out againſt it as New Doctrine, and contrary to Friends Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And it moſt evidently appeareth from the expreſs Words of my Book of <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Grace,</hi> pag. 120. That I did not then hold that the Light within was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Salvation without any thing elſe, or without Chriſt's outward coming, and his Obedience, Sufferings and Death, (as my Adverſaries <hi>Caleb Puſie,</hi> and the Second Days Meeting that hath approved his Book do affirm, and as theſe Men alſo do, who have given out their Scandalous Book, called <hi>The People called Quakers cleared)</hi> for I ſay expreſly in that <hi>pag.</hi> 120. <q>The Light within, and Chriſt's outward coming with his Obedience, Sufferings and Death, are both ſufficient, uſeful and neceſſary in their own kind and way,</q> Conſummating, and being Conſummate in another. And here Note, that though I did not ſay, Chriſt within, and Chriſt without, are two Chriſts; yet I ſaid his Light within, and his Coming in the Outward, with his Obedience, Sufferings and Death, were two things, Conſummating and being Conſummated in one another. Now to wipe off the Injurious Charge of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries G. W. and J. P. in this particular (which I thank God, I can as eaſily do, and all other their Injurious Charges againſt me, as <hi>Paul</hi> did throw off the Viper from his Hand, I ſay conform to the Doctrine of my former Books, and in good Conſiſtency with all the paſſages in them, the Light within (which in a true ſenſe is God and Chriſt the Eternal and Eſſential Word) is to be Preached in the firſt place, to <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> or any other called <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who have not any true knowledge of God, or fear and reverence of him, and to all bold and preſumptuous Sinners, and briefly to all Men whatſoever, not really and truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Chriſtian Religion, to bring them in the firſt place to ſome knowledge of God, and ſome true fear and reverence of him, and alſo to ſome true knowledge and ſenſe of their ſinful ſtate and condition, and that they are liable to the Wrath and Diſpleaſure of God for their Sins; all which are in good order previous or prior to the true Chriſtian Faith, which is a Faith in Chriſt crucified and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be Preached before that Faith. But that the Chriſtian Faith it ſelf may be received by Preaching, that Faith is one of the firſt things that is to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. as being one of the firſt Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, as is clear from theſe Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 20, 21. where <hi>Repentance towards God,</hi> and <hi>Faith towards the Lord Jeſus Christ,</hi> are joined together as firſt Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. And theſe Ignorant Men ſo deeply Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cod againſt the Preaching of Chriſt Crucified (to wit, G. W. and J. P.) as being one of the firſt things needful to be Preached, and Faith in him, in Order to make Men true Chriſtians, might by the ſame Silly Sophiſtry and Quibling, accuſe <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>John</hi> contradicting each other and inconſiſtent; yea, the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, who did inſpire them both, in what they wrot: For whenas <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> when he Preached the Goſpel unto them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 3. that he <hi>delivered</hi> unto them <hi>Firſt of All</hi> (Note theſe Words, <hi>firſt of all)</hi> that which he alſo <hi>received, how that Christ dyed for our Sins according to the Scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he roſe again the third day,</hi> &amp;c. And yet <hi>John</hi> Preached not that the firſt thing, but began with Preaching the <hi>Word that was in the beginning,</hi> and how in that <hi>Word was Life,</hi> and <hi>the Life was the Light of Men; and that Light was the true Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</hi> John 1. 1. to 9. But in this there is no Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction nor Inconſiſtency betwixt <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>John;</hi> for <hi>John</hi> begins with that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Doctrine that is neceſſary to General Religion, and to the Knowledge of God as Creator; <hi>Paul</hi> begins with the Preaching CHRIST Crucified, as one of the firſt things neceſſary to Chriſtian Religion, and the knowledge thereof: And ſuch Order is neceſſary in teaching Practical Arts and Sciences, as in order to teach
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47493:15"/>
               <hi>Astronomy,</hi> ſome firſt Principles of <hi>Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Geometry</hi> are neceſſary to be taught in the firſt place, as to add and ſubſtract in Arithmetic, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to make a Perpendicular Line, or draw a Paralel, to biſect an Angle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet none of theſe are properly Principles of <hi>Astronomy,</hi> as it is a peculiar Science: But the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Astronomy</hi> are not to be taught before <hi>Arithmetick</hi> and <hi>Geometry,</hi> but after them. And ſo the firſt Principles of Medicine, are to be taught after the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Phyſicks; and thus the firſt Principles of Chriſtian Theology are to be taught after the firſt Principles of Ethicks, or Ethology, which was the <hi>Gentile</hi> Religion, and which did teach many true and excellent things of God, as is to be ſeen in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Ethicks, who wrote of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> i. e. ſomething Divine in Man, by which he could live virtuouſly; and yet who but he that is no true Chriſtian him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will ſay, that <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> Ethicks, or <hi>Socrate's</hi> and <hi>Platoe's</hi> Morals, are enough to teach the Chriſtian Theology. Thus I hope I have made it appear, that as my Adverſaries have not proved me inconſiſtent with my ſelf, ſo they have proved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inconſiſtent with true Chriſtianity, and no true Chriſtians in their Principles, but Heathens, and falling ſhort of Heathen Morals, in Falſly accuſing the Innocent, a Vice contrary to true Morality.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part of their Charge, in <hi>pag.</hi> 10. is, <q>That I did formerly hold that Chriſt's Inward coming ſaves,</q> where the Outwardis unknown. But here they are guilty of groſs Forgery and Perverſion; firſt of Forgery, ſeeing they cite no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in any of my Books, where I expreſs theſe Words, <hi>where the Outward is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,</hi> and ſeeing by their Words, <hi>where the Outward is unknown,</hi> they mean Chriſt's coming without us, I ſay they are guilty of groſly perverting my Words and Senſe, as if I did hold, that Chriſt's inward coming ſaves, with Eternal Salvation, without all knowledge of Chriſt's outward coming; and in contradiction to themſelves, they grant I have diſtinguiſhed betwixt the <hi>expreſs</hi> or <hi>explicit</hi> Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt's Death and Sufferings, in order to Eternal Salvation, and the <hi>implicit</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Faith of it; aſſerting this laſt, but not the firſt, as <hi>univerſa'ly</hi> and <hi>indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly neceſſary.</hi> They object againſt this diſtinction idlely and falſly, that it is ſaid by me, pag. 14. 'That the diſtinction betwixt <hi>explicit</hi> and <hi>implicit,</hi> is a late diſtinction: But the place of my Book, cited by them, ſaith no ſuch thing. But I mention how in divers of my late Books I have diſtinguiſhed betwixt the <hi>expreſs</hi> and <hi>implicit</hi> Knowledge and Faith; but this proves it not to be a late diſtinction, for it is an antient diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſufficiently implied and underſtood in my oldeſt Books, when I treat on that ſubject; for whereas they confeſs that I have uſed the Word <hi>expreſs</hi> in my oldeſt Books, that proveth that I did then make that diſtinction, though I did not expreſs the other term of <hi>implicit,</hi> which though not expreſſed, yet was really underſtood by me, as in many caſes it is enough to expreſs the one Term or Member of a diſtinction, as when we call a <hi>Man</hi> a <hi>rational Creature</hi> though we expreſs not the Word <hi>Irrational,</hi> yet we ſufficiently diſtinguiſh betwixt a Man and a Bruit, that Man is <hi>rational,</hi> and a Bruit is <hi>irrational;</hi> and when I ſay, ſome or many things commanded us, are <hi>jure divine,</hi> this ſufficiently implyeth and intimateth, to any of common ſenſe, that ſome things may be commanded us, that are not <hi>jure divino,</hi> but <hi>jure humano;</hi> yea, all things done and practiſed by the People called Quakers, are not <hi>jure divine,</hi> as themſelves confeſs; therefore as <hi>jure divino</hi> implieth the other term of the diſtinction, when not expreſſed, viz. <hi>jure humano,</hi> ſo the term <hi>expreſs</hi> implieth the other term <hi>implicit,</hi> though not expreſſed. And though my ignorant Adverſaries would make their ignorant Followers think, this is only a new and odd, diſtinction of mine, yet all true and Orthodox <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do hold it as well as I, and have uſed it, as they do at preſent, and hath its Foundation in Scripture; for when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 6. That the Myſtery, how that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Heirs, and of the ſame Body, and partakers of his Promiſe in Chriſt by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47493:15"/>
in other Ages was not made known unto the Sons of Men, as it is now revealed unto his Holy Apoſtles and Prophets by the Spirit, he plainly implieth this diſtinction, for in other Ages, yea, in all Ages it was at leaſt <hi>obſcurely</hi> and <hi>implicitly</hi> made known but not <hi>expreſly</hi> as in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Age, and the Ages ſucceeding; and that Great Myſtery of Chriſt is ſaid by <hi>Paul,</hi> to have been <hi>kept ſecret ſince the world began, but now is made manifest, and by the Scriptures of the Prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all Nations for the obedience of faith,</hi> Rom. 16. 25, 26. Now what is <hi>made manifest</hi> but <hi>expreſ?</hi> And what is <hi>kept ſecret,</hi> but <hi>implicit?</hi> So that this very diſtinction, which my ignorant Adverſaries blame in me as new and odd, is the very diſtinction of <hi>Paul</hi> in equivalent terms: And ſeeing they will not allow that diſtinction, as applied to the Knowledge of Chriſt without us, of <hi>expreſs</hi> and <hi>implicit,</hi> it is plain they hold, that not any Knowledge, not the leaſt grain of the knowledge of Chriſt without men, is univerſally neceſſary to Salvation, neither <hi>expreſs</hi> nor <hi>implicit;</hi> which how Antichriſtian and Unſcriptural it is, I leave to all true Chriſtians to judge. But why will they not allow it as well, with reſpect to the knowledge of Chriſt without us, as of Chriſt within us? Will they ſay that Men may be ſaved without all knowledge of Chriſt within, either <hi>expreſs</hi> or <hi>implicit?</hi> If yea, then we ſhall ſee what ignorant Perſons they allow ſhall be ſaved, and what a prodigious Ignorance they eſtabliſh: If nay, then they muſt anſwer me with the ſame diſtinction in the ſame terms; or in terms equilvalent; and if they uſe that, or any other the like diſtinction, it ſhall be found new enough to them, at leaſt as new, or rather much more new, as that I have uſed in this caſe: nor needs <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> blame me for uſing new Diſtinctions, ſeeing both himſelf and <hi>William Penn</hi> have uſed them in ſeveral Caſes, <hi>to ſerve a turn</hi> (a phraſe they apply to me, pag. 19.) as in excuſing <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> his ſaying, <q>Chriſt is not diſtinct from the Saints, the Soul is a part of God. And when they excuſe <hi>Iſ. Pennington</hi>'s ſaying, 'Can outward Blood cleanſe?</q> And <hi>George Whitehead</hi> his excuſing his former Sayings in divers of his old Books, 'that Chriſt is not in all Men. He comes off with this diſtinction of late, ſaying, 'He is not in all Men unitedly, or by union. Which diſtinction I uſed not only in my Book of <hi>Univerſal Grace,</hi> which was written in the Year 1669. (though not printed till the Year 1671.) but alſo in my Anſwer to the Thirty Queries, ſent by the Biſhop of <hi>Aberden,</hi> expreſly mentioned in the Preface to <hi>Robert Barclay</hi>'s Anſwer to <hi>VVilliam Mitchel,</hi> in his Preface to it, called, <hi>Truth cleared of Calumnies.</hi> The which Anſwer of mine to the ſaid Thirty Queries, was given in the Year 1666. before R. B. printed any thing, or before he was a Quaker: And I the rather mention this my Anſwer to theſe Thirty Queries, becauſe in theſe chief things which my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries charge me to be changed in, my Faith is the ſame now, as it is there decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as well as in my other Printed Books, which Anſwer I have in Manuſcript writ 30 Years ago, Copies of which are in ſeveral Hands, and which I ſhall be ready to ſhow to any ſober Enquirers. And what pittiful, unſound, and odd, as well as new Diſtinctions, hath <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> uſed, to excuſe <hi>G. Fox</hi> his ſaying, <hi>Your Goſpel,</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Mark, Luke, <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>are Dust and the Serpents Meat:</hi> He ſaying, <hi>It was to be meant of the Ink and Paper which would turn to Dust.</hi> But who did ever call the Ink and Paper the Goſpel? or who did ever think that the Serpent, which is the Devil, doth eat Ink and Paper? Oh for ſhame! let theſe Men ceaſe to blame me for new Diſtinctions, when they have made ſo many Falſe and Nonſenſical new Diſtinctions, more Fooliſh than ever were heard of. And his excuſing <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> Blaſphemy, in ſaying, <hi>The Blood that came out of Chriſt's Side, was no more than the Blood of another Saint:</hi> Behold his moſt Unlearned and Fooliſh Diſtinction, inconſiſtent with and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to that known great Principle of the People called Quakers, That Chriſt dyed for all Men, and ſhed his Blood for all: <hi>His meaning was,</hi> ſaid G.

               <hi>as to</hi> Papiſts <hi>and you,</hi> viz. Baptiſts, <hi>whoſe Minds are Carnol.</hi> But another idle imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Cavil they make againſt the diſtinction of <hi>expreſs</hi> Knowledge of Chriſt's Death <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>implicit,</hi> is, 'That I uſe that Word <hi>expreſs</hi> as a word of Courſe, and of no 'Force, as when I ſaid, That many of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity ſuffer diſadvantage by his 'Diſobedience, who never knew it expreſly. But that ever any periſhed by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, who never knew it either <hi>expreſly,</hi> or <hi>implicitly,</hi> as they alledge, ſeeing they bring no proof of it, I reject as falſe and fictitious: It is evident from the Heathen Philoſophers Writings, and particularly from <hi>Plato,</hi> that they knew at leaſt <hi>implicitiy</hi> the Fall of Man, and the degeneration of Mankind in general, for <hi>Plato</hi> not only mentions the Fall of Man but Tò <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. an imbred Evil in Men, that is born with them. And how can any Impartial Reader that reads my Books, when I ſo oft caution, reſtrict and limit the Words on that ſubject, with the term <hi>Expreſs;</hi> and at other times, with the Words <hi>clear Diſtinct Knowledge;</hi> and at other times, with the Words <hi>Hiſtorical, Outward Knowledge;</hi> all which, and the like Words, <hi>R. Barelay</hi> hath uſed in ſeveral Places of his <hi>Apology,</hi> after my Method, and divers Years after I uſed that Method of Expreſſion; and I well know we were of One Mind in that thing, and I publiſhed his <hi>Latin Theſes</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> firſt of all, and carried them over with me out of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at his deſire; whereof I can bring ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Witneſs; and we uſed to Diſcourſe together frequently on that Subject, and both of us on purpoſe uſed theſe Cautions and Reſtricted Words, as <hi>expreſs, clear, distinct, historical, outward,</hi> and <hi>in the outward</hi> (viz. in the outward Hiſtory, or Letter) to ſignifie, that we did not intend that any were ſaved with Eternal Salvation without all Knowledge or Faith of Chriſt without, though without the <hi>expreſs</hi> they might, and ſtill may, where it is not revealed. And they are as Nonſenſical and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, in ſeeking to marr my Diſtinction (by falſly alledging, I have marred it) by their dictator-like, ſaying, <hi>There is no Medium between knowing very darkly in Vails, and Figures</hi> (implicitly in a very obſcure Degree) <hi>and not knowing at all,</hi> pag. 15. But to confute their Ignorance, let any Man of common Senſe anſwer me; Is there no Medium between knowing very Darkly, and not knowing at all? Is the Particle or little Word <hi>[very]</hi> Superlative in the higheſt Degree? or is it not rather Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative? Is there no medium betwixt a Mans being <hi>very ignorant,</hi> and <hi>knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all?</hi> If there be none, then by <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s Logick, (who hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writ this Book that I anſwer, or approved it) becauſe he is <hi>very Ignorant,</hi> (as I have ſufficiently proved) he <hi>knoweth nothing at all.</hi> But ſurely the moſt ignorant may and do know ſome things; therefore G. W. is as ignorant in true Logick, as in true Divinity.</p>
            <p>Another Forgery and Perverſion they put upon my Words, in pag. 15. when they make me ſay, <q>Men have been ſaved without the expreſs Knowledge of the one, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt's outward coming,</q> but not of the other, <hi>viz.</hi> his inward coming. But I never ſaid or thought any ſuch thing, I have judged charitably, and ſo I ſtill judge that many have been ſaved, and may be ſaved without the expreſs Knowledge, as truly of his <hi>inward</hi> coming as of his <hi>outward;</hi> for many have felt and enjoyed the bleſſed Vertue and Power of Chriſt within them, and ſo have had an implicit know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, and it hath been ſaving to them, though they had not that clear and expreſs knowledge to call it by all, or many of theſe Names that the Scriptures call it by expreſly; and ſhall we ſay they muſt all periſh, who though they own the Grace and Spirit of Chriſt, and its operation in them, yet are ſhy and fearful to call it Chriſt in them; and to be ſure, as few of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> knew this inward Principle of Truth in them, by the expreſs Knowledge and Names of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> as knew him to be Man in the outward by theſe Names. And here Note, that ten ſeveral times at leaſt in the Words and Paſſages they have quoted out of my Books, they bring me in, uſing the Word <hi>Expreſs</hi> ſtill, ſaying, <q>The Expreſs
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47493:16"/>
Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt's Death is not univerſally neceſſary to Mens Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</q> And ſeeing in all my late Books, and alſo at preſent, I ſay the ſame. I appeal to all moderate Perſons of common ſenſe, if this be any contradiction, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth not this falſe and unfair way of their Arguing, evidently prove them wonderfully ignorant and blinded with Prejudice againſt me: and let any School-Boy, or Tiro, or Perſon of Common Senſe judge, if theſe two Propoſitions held by me, and thouſands more are contradictory, The expreſs Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt is not neceſſary to all that ſhall be ſaved. Some Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt is neceſſary to all that ſhall be ſaved: Even as whether theſe two Propoſitions be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory, The clear Light of Sun, Moon, Fire or Candle, is not neceſſary to ſee and read with? Some light of Sun, Moon, Fire, or Candle is neceſſary to ſee and read with.</p>
            <p>Their next Head is, <hi>pag.</hi> 23. <q>That I ſaid in my former Books, the Inward Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is to be Preached in the firſt place, and the Effects thereof.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This I grant ſtill, and how and in what ſenſe, in the Words aforegoing I have ſufficiently declared, and I further add, That ſome true knowledge of God ſpringing from the Inward Principle, in concurrence with the ſerious Conſideration of the Works of Creation and Providence is neceſſary as previous and prior to the knowledge of Chriſt's Death and Sufferings for our Sins; for in God's ordinary way, we are firſt taught that there is a God, before we are taught that there is one only Son of God, that proceeded from him by an Eternal Generation, and who became the Son of Man by Generation in the Fullneſs of Time. The firſt of theſe Leſſons or Doctrines belong to all Men to know; and they are rather Bruits than Men who know it not. The ſecond of theſe Leſſons is proper and peculiar to Chriſtians, and may well be called at leaſt one of the firſt things needful to be preached, known and believed among them called <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and as the Doctrine of Chriſt's outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is truly and duly Preached by enlightned and well qualified Preachers, that more excellent and peculiar Influence and Miniſtration of the Spirit, that accompanies the Faith of Chriſt crucified, is alſo preached; and not only preached, but freely given and imparted by God, through Chriſt, to all ſuch who hear it and believe it ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely as it is preached. Therefore what is neceſſary in the firſt place to be preached to them that have little or no true Knowledge of God, or of an Inward Principle, is one thing, and what is firſt to be preached in order to bring Men to the Chriſtian Faith and Religion more immedately and proximately, is another: as what is neceſſary in the firſt place to be Preached, to Men, that they may know God, and believe in him, as a Creator, King, and Lord over all, is one thing; and what is neceſſary to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Men in the firſt place, that they may know God, and believe in him as a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Father, pardoning their Sins freely for Chriſt's ſake, and accepting them in him and that alſo they may believe in Chriſt crucified, is another thing: All which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſufficiently what I have delivered both in my former and latter Books, to be well conſiſtent on this very Head, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Faith of Chriſt's Death and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings is one of the firſt Principles of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and therefore is ſo to be preached, together with the Reſurrection of the Dead, and Eternal Judgment, and Repentance from dead Works, according to <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. which according to the <hi>Greek,</hi> is there called <hi>The Word of the Beginning of Christ.</hi> But what do my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries bring againſt me on this Head, to prove my Self-contradiction? Nothing at all; therefore they ſhow themſelves ſtronger in Falſly Accuſing, than in juſtly Proving.</p>
            <p>Their following Head is <hi>pag.</hi> 25. Where they charge me with a Self-contradiction in ſaying, <q>The Gentiles were ſavingly enlightned, who knew not the Hiſtory of Chriſt's outward coming, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> And they think I contradict my ſelf, when I ſaid in my Book, called <hi>A further Diſcovery,</hi> pag. 10. of one called a Friend, that lately Preached, <q>That he was a bold ignorant Soul, for preaching, that the Blood which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47493:17"/>
cleanſeth from all Sin, was the Life, and the Life is the Light, calling it a perverſe Expoſition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer;</hi> That it is a perverſe Expoſition, and that he who gave it, was a bold ignorant Soul, I ſtill affirm, and I charge them to be guilty of groſs Forgery, until they prove that I have ſaid the ſame, and gave that Expoſition on that place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7. which I do not in the leaſt remember; but no proof they bring any where that I have ſo ſaid; and their Argument is Fallacious and Deceitful like themſelves, that becauſe I have ſaid, It is the Life that ſaveth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. citing pag. 115. of my Book called <hi>Univerſal Grace,</hi> therefore that by <hi>Blood</hi> in that place 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7. I did mean the <hi>Life,</hi> which is the <hi>Light within:</hi> And the Fallacy and Sophiſtry of their Argument lieth in this, that becauſe I have granted the <hi>Life within</hi> ſaveth, or cleanſeth from Sin, that therefore the Blood mentioned, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7. is the Life. Now if I had ſaid, Nothing but the Life within ſaveth, or cleanſeth from all Sin, they might have juſtly ſo argued: But ſeeing <hi>I</hi> ever held as I do at preſent hold, that there are ſeveral concurring Cauſes in the great Work of our Salvation, and cleanſing from Sin, which though agreeing in one Harmony, yet the one Cauſe is not the other, therefore their Argument is as vain and falſe, as who did argue, the little Muſtard-Seed cauſeth the Herb Muſtard to grow, and the Earth in which it is ſown cauſeth it to grow, and the Sun and Rain cauſe it to grow, therefore that little Seed is the Earth, is the Sun, and is the Rain. Our Salvation and cleanſing from Sin, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on divers Cauſes; <hi>1ſt.</hi> chiefly on God, who gave his Son to Dye for us; <hi>2dly.</hi> on Chriſt, who ſhed his Blood outwardly to cleanſe us from Sin; <hi>3dly.</hi> on the Spirit, Life and Grace of Chriſt inwardly given us, helping and enabling us by a Living Faith, to apply the Merit, Virtue, and Efficacy of that Blood of Chriſt outwardly-ſhed, for our Salvation, and cleanſing both from the guilt of Sin, and the inward filth and ſtain of it. But before I finiſh my Anſwer to this Head, let me give Notice to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſeveral groſs Perverſions, Falſities, and Abuſes they put on my Sound Words, cited in their ſeveral pages, on theſe laſt Heads, from pag. 15. to pag. 33. <hi>Firſt,</hi> in pag. 16. they pervert my Plain Words, where I ſaid, <q>Though Prophets and Apoſtles preached him as in the Form of a Man; yet they preached him alſo, and that more generally,</q> as a Light to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yea, and to <hi>Jews</hi> alſo: Where they put a falſe and perverſe ſenſe upon the Word <hi>more generally,</hi> as if I did ſignifie by it <hi>more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,</hi> which I did not; but by <hi>more generally,</hi> I did and do underſtand, that his Inward Appearance by his Light and Grace in Men, is, and ever was <hi>more general</hi> than his Outward Appearance, in the outward and viſible form of a Man; therefore what was in it ſelf more general they Preached it to be ſo; but this doth not infer that they Preached him more frequently within Men, than without them, for if they preached, as they wrote, in their Writings, where once we read of Chriſt within, we read ſome Scores of times, of Chriſt, as he was outwardly manifeſt, was Born, Dyed, Buried, Roſe again, Aſcended, and is gone into Heaven, where he remains our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, and Mediator with the Father. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They perverſely infer from my Words, <q>that whereas I formerly made the Knowledge and Faith of the Hiſtory of Chriſt's outward coming not eſſential to Religion, now I did make it eſſential.</q> But in this they are guilty of palbable Forgery; for as none of the citations they bring, prove it, ſo I do not remember that ever I ſo ſaid or writ; but the Knowledge and Faith of the Hiſtory is one thing; and the implicit Knowledge and Faith of Chriſt, as he is without us, is another thing; and therefore for them thus to confound thing, ſo differing, argueth great Ignorance, or Prejudice; and however it argueth great Falſity and Unfair Dealing. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That they make it an Inconſiſtency and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in me to have formerly ſaid, <hi>Cornelius</hi> was a Devout and Religious Man, one whoſe Prayer God heard; and yet of late to have ſaid, <hi>Cornelius</hi> had not the Holy Ghoſt in his <hi>Gentile</hi> eſtate, although he had a great meaſure of <hi>Gentile</hi> Sincerity and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47493:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Righteouſneſs. But this is no real Contradiction, although it may ſeem ſo to their Ignorance and Darkneſs; it is eaſie to ſhow out of Scripture, that none had the Holy Ghoſt, or are ſaid to have the Holy Ghoſt, but Believers in Chriſt Crucified, who did witneſs that ſpecial Office of the Holy Ghoſt to ſanctifie them, by giving them the Holy Faith in Chriſt crucified. And though the Holy Ghoſt is holy, as well in his Nature, as in his ſpecial Office of ſanctifying them, who witneſs his indwelling in them, and union with him, yet he is commonly called ſo in Scripture, by virtue of his ſpecial Office and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nfluence in the Hearts of Believers; and therefore as he is not ſaid to be the Holy Ghoſt or Holy Spirit in wicked men, ſo nor in pious <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> or in ſuch only, as are but as Servants, and under the firſt Miniſtration of the Spirit, and <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s diſtinction, how Chriſt is not in all men, will ſerve in this caſe as well for me, as for him, to wit, by Union, which I think was mine in Print, before it was in Print his, according to which as Chriſt is only ſaid to live and dwell in true Believers in Chriſt, even CHRIST Crucified, and none but ſuch have Chriſt by a real Intereſt in him, and right to him, as a Woman hath to her true Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; So none but true Believers have the Holy Ghoſt, or the Spirit of Chriſt, to wit, by Union, Right and Intereſt, for that is only the Portion of Children not of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as it was ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he gave Gifts to the Children of <hi>Keturah,</hi> but he gave <hi>All,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Inheritance</hi> to <hi>Iſaac:</hi> ſo God giveth Gifts to ſuch as are but only Servants in his Houſe, but giveth himſelf, and his dear Son, and Holy Spirit, to be the Inheritance of his Children.</p>
            <p>And as to their Queſtion, which they think in their Ignorance is unanſwerable, 'Whether any Prayer is heard by God, but what is put by his Spirit?</p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Nay, but Servants and Pious Gentiles, ſuch as <hi>Cornelius</hi> was in his Gentile ſtate, may be, and are helped to Pray by the Spirit, having the Influence of the firſt Miniſtration of the Spirit, which though remotely Preparatory, yet doth not inſtate the Soul into union with the Spirit, that being reſerved for the ſecond Miniſtration of the Spirit, that is more noble, and enableth the Soul that hath it, not only to Pray more effectually and acceptably, but alſo to perform all other Acts of Love and Obedience. And were not my Adverſaries extream blind and ignorant, they might underſtand how the Apoſtle calleth one and the ſame Spirit, in them who are but Servants, <hi>the Spirit of ſervitude</hi> (ſo the Greek) and in them who are Sons, <hi>the Spirit of Adoption</hi> Rom. 18. 5. And elſewhere he diſtinguiſheth thus, calling the one the <hi>Spirit of Fear</hi> and the other the <hi>Spirit of Power, of Love, and of a Sound Mind,</hi> 1. Tim. 1. 7. Which are thus diſtinguiſhed, not in Nature and Being, but in Office. And here let it be noted, how by theſe mens arguing, <hi>That Men may be eternally ſaved, perfectly ſanctified, and endued with the Holy Ghoſt, who have no Faith or Knowledge of Chriſt without them;</hi> do ſufficiently declare what Heathens they are, and of what little value they make the Faith and Knowledge of Chriſt crucified, and that their Religion is nothing but <hi>Deiſne,</hi> under a Mask &amp; Diſguiſe of a Chriſtian Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They make it an Inconſiſtency and Contradiction in me, to have ſaid, <hi>pag.</hi> 22. <q>That many who never had the Scriptures, if they have been faithful unto God, in what he hath revealed unto them, by the Light of Chriſt in them; who dare or can ſay, that they have not been accepted, yet not without Faith in Chriſt in ſome meaſure; for they that believe in the Light believe in Chriſt, who is that Light.</q> Citing <hi>Rector Corrected,</hi> pag. 150. But where is my Contradiction here? Did I ever ſay, That men may believe in the Light, or Chriſt within, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at any time from firſt to laſt believe in Chriſt without, either <hi>expreſly,</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly:</hi> For this they bring no proof, and I believe they can bring none.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In pag. 26. they moſt Ignorantly and Antichriſtianly blame my ſound Chriſtian Aſſertion, where I ſay, <q>The work of Sanctification is aſcribed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Chriſt's Blood and Sufferings, as well as to his Inward Appearance, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47493:18"/>
 to both indiſpenſably neceſſary,</q> and to Faith therein. Thus we ſee plainly they place all upon Chriſt within, and nothing upon Chriſt without. O bold Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſm! publiſhed in the Face of a Nation proſeſſing Chriſtianity: But wherein I have contradicted that Aſſertion, they ſhow not.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6thly.</hi> They bring me in guilty of a Contradiction, for ſaying, <q>Nor is the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Name that which ſaveth, but the inward Nature, Virtue and Power ſignified thereby, which was made manifeſt in them <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> But they no where ſhew how I contradict this. I ſay ſtill, It is not the outward Name either of God, or Chriſt, that ſaveth, without the Inward Nature, Virtue and Power; which Inward Nature, Virtue and Power, dwelt and dwells in all Fullneſs in the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and of whoſe fullneſs we all receive, and Grace for Grace; and all that believe in him, who hath the fullneſs, they receive rich ſupplies out of his Fulneſs daily of more Grace; which they that do not believe in him, do not receive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> They charge me with Contradiction, becauſe formerly I ſaid, <q>That theſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> had the Goſpel preached unto them, who were not under any outward Adminiſtration of the Goſpel.</q> But they bring no place to prove where I contradict this Aſſertion, as I do not at preſent contradict it, but own it in a true ſenſe; and the former Diſtinction will ſerve here, of <hi>expreſs</hi> and <hi>implicit,</hi> and I ſtill grant, that the Goſpel <hi>implicitly</hi> is Preached to all Men, in ſome meaſure, after ſome ſort <hi>(Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Fiſher</hi> calls it a Goſpel-Dram, ſomewhere in his <hi>Ruſticus ad Academicos,</hi> as I have read it in him) but few have obeyed it, as ſo preached; but whoever did obey it, I queſtion not, but they were accepted. But here let it be Noted, that whereas they would divert the Main Part and Branch of the Queſtion which was and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and me, of the Neceſſity of our Faith in <hi>Christ crucified</hi> to our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who are profeſſed Chriſtians, wholly to the Caſe and State of the Gentiles, who have it not outwardly Preached to them by the Miniſtry of Men, or Books, I have ſufficiently proved againſt them at our late Meeting at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> 11th. of the 4th. Month, 1696. And in the printed <hi>Narrative,</hi> that they have affirmed, <hi>That it is not neceſſary to our Salvation, to believe that Christ dyed for us,</hi> &amp;c. This Charge lyeth at their Door, which is the main Thing in Queſtion. But how the moſt Pious and Upright among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were ſaved by Faith in Chriſt Crucified, who had not Faith outwardly Preached, is neither the great or chief Queſtion, nor ſo proper for us to determine, ſeeing God hath ways to have done it, unknown to us, whoſe Ways are above our Ways, as the Heavens are above the Earth; and it may be one of theſe Secret things that belong to God, and not to us, till he pleaſe to reveal it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eightly,</hi> pag. 30. They charge me with a Contradiction, for ſaying, <q>He (Chriſt) left not the other Nations deſtitute of the <hi>Main and Principal Thing,</hi> even the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Light,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which would have given them the Knowledge of God, <hi>&amp;c</hi> But if they think, or would have others to think, that by the <hi>Main and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Thing,</hi> I meant the Light within, compared with Chriſt without, in whom all fulneſs of Light and Grace dwelleth, they both deceive themſelves and ſeek to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others; For by my following words, it is manifeſt, I call the Light within the Main Thing, in Compariſon with outward Things, as is plain from my following words, cited by them, out of my Book, pag. 12. <hi>Univerſal Grace,</hi> and not in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with Chriſt without, in whom the Fulneſs of Light dwells.</p>
            <p>As for their ſuggeſtion of my holding the Revolution of Humane Souls, in pag. 31. and more particularly in pag. 3. of <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Poſtſcript, who calls it my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Twelve Revolutions of Humane Souls, they have rendred themſelves ſo fooliſhly impertinent as well as malicious, thinking thereby to caſt a great Odium upon me, for holding ſuch an odd Opinion, that I need ſay little or nothing in anſwer to them, having ſo fully and plainly in the openneſs of my Heart anſwered to that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47493:18"/>
Charge, in my Printed Treatiſe, called, <hi>Truth and Innocency Defended,</hi> in Anſwer to <hi>John Delavall,</hi> who was one of the firſt that charged me with the ſame, and ſince that, no leſs than Four ſeveral Perſons have charged me with it in Print, whereby they have ſufficiently manifeſted both their Folly and Malice, beſides the many Whiſperings and Mutterings they have uſed, and ſpread abroad againſt me, far and near on that account, their Folly is ſufficiently manifeſted, that not one of all my Accuſers have brought the leaſt Authentick Evidence againſt me, to prove their Charge. And as I have fully cleared my ſelf in the caſe, in my Anſwer above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, Printed at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> ſome Years ago; ſo in my Appendix to the Book, called, <hi>The General Hiſtory of the Quakers,</hi> lately Printed at <hi>London,</hi> in this Year 1696. But let us hear G. W. his Evidence, to prove his Charge againſt me: He ſaith, <hi>That I argued from theſe Scriptures,</hi> John 11. 9. Pſal. 90. 4. 2 Pet. 3. 8. <hi>and ſome others, If I miſtake not,</hi> ſaith he, (Is this like Infallible <hi>George Whitehead?) If he ſays I do, let him give us a plain State of his own Opinion herein.</hi> Now would ſuch an imperfect and lame Evidence paſs current before any Judicatory, <hi>The thing is ſo and ſo, if I mistake not.</hi> And as to the Manuſcript he mentions that I ſhewed him; it is true, there was ſuch a Manuſcript, which I read both to him and <hi>George Fox,</hi> wherein I did undertake to Anſwer to ſome Objections againſt the Univerſal Principle; and there were ſome things in that Manuſcript modeſtly propoſed, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Revolutions of ſome Souls, but no ways as any poſitive Concluſion, but ſimply as an Hypotheſis, or Suppoſition; and if ſuch a Manuſcript, or the Contents of it were ſuch a Crime in G. K. to render me an Apoſtate, and gone from Truth, why did not <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> before twelve Years paſt, (for ſo long ago it is ſince that Manuſcript was read to him) deal with me, by giving me Goſpel-Order, ſince what I had writ in that Manuſcript was ſo offenſive to him, after his telling me my Fault in private, and I not amending, ſhould he not have obſerved Chriſt's order to have taken with him one or two more, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 6. And if I did neglect to hear them, to tell it to the Church, that they might have dealt with me. But he having done none of this (only ſhowing ſomewhat of his private diſſatisfaction with the Hypotheſis, which he could not charge upon me as poſitive, as neither he did) Is not he much more blame-worthy? and hath he not brought a great Reflection on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and alſo on <hi>George Fox,</hi> that they did ſo Connive at my ſuppoſed great Error, and ſo long, yea, and for all that time thereafter to own me as a Friend in Truth, as they both did, and writ to me from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>America,</hi> calling me <hi>dear George Keith</hi> (yea, <hi>G. Fox</hi> in his Letter, particularly deſired me to viſit Friends in <hi>New-England,</hi> and to travel in the Service of Truth in that Country; as accordingly I did) until now, that <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> hath riſen up againſt me, and raiſed up alſo many with him againſt me, for no other Cauſe, as is well known, but for oppoſing the Vile Errors I found among them, both there in <hi>America,</hi> and here in <hi>England.</hi> And whereas ſome in Print and <hi>George Whitehead</hi> in writing has accuſed me of Hypocriſie, for having formerly called him <hi>dear George Whitehead,</hi> and ſince that I have changed my thoughts concerning him; If it be no Hypocriſie in him, to have formerly called me ſo, and yet now to have other thoughts of me; why ſhould he make it hypocriſie in me, to have done but that to him, which he hath done to me? Doth not this prove him guilty of Hypocriſie with a witneſs. But leaving <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> a while, let me return a little to the Book.</p>

When they cannot by fair and direct means, prove their charge againſt me, to render me odious, they eſſay to do it by unfair, that is by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, not ſo much from my Words, but from the Words of Scripture, as from my ſaying, in <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> pag. 23. <hi>As it is obſerved by ſome, neither</hi> Adam, <hi>nor any of his Poſterity, living a compleat Thouſand Years, which in Scripture ſignifies ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Day,</hi> Pſal. 90. <hi>It may be ſaid, he lived not a whole Day:</hi>

that this is a Principle of the Revolutioniſts, is plain to all that know their Principles and that it is his alſo, is manifeſt.</q> But what a lame Evidence and Argument is this, let all intelligent Perſons judge: If they had ſaid, It is the alone Principle of the Revolutioniſts, and proved it ſo, they had argued ſomewhat to the purpoſe. Sure I am <hi>Juſt in Martyr</hi> held it, for I have read it in him; Doth it therefore follow that he was a Revolutioniſt? If it doth, then the Notion of the Revolutions is not ſo great a Crime, as to render a Man an Apoſtate, or gone from Truth: And not only <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> but many others, Worthy, Antient, and late Chriſtian Writers have held the ſame Principle, that a thouſand Years in Scripture ſometimes ſignifies a Day, and particularly the renowned L. <hi>Neper</hi> of <hi>Mareheſton,</hi> in his Expoſition on the <hi>Revelation.</hi> Surely theſe Men have greatly miſſed their aim, who thinking to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and reproach me with the Revolutions, by allowing me ſo good company, Men highly eſteemed for their Chriſtian Piety, have rather contrary to their Deſigns, greatly honoured me; but Malice is always Blind, and throws its Poſſeſſor into the Ditch, he makes for another. And if the reckoning a Thouſand Years for a Day, prove the Revolutions, I ſhall not only have the above-named worthy Perſons for my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, but <hi>David,</hi> or (as others think <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſee the Title of that <hi>Pſalm)</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> who both ſo reckoned <hi>Pſalm</hi> 90. 4. compared with 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 8. But that theſe Men may ſtill give me more good Company, they will needs have <hi>Paul</hi> to bear me company in the Notion of the Revolutions, and long after him <hi>Beza,</hi> a Renowned Man among <hi>Prot ſtants,</hi> both for Piety and Learning: for thus they argue from my Words, or rather the Words of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi>'s Tranſlation, pag. 42. <hi>Truth Adv.</hi>

But before Faith came, we were kept under the Law,</hi> [Note, <hi>Beza</hi> doth excellently well tranſlate it, according to the Greek, <hi>ſub legis preſidio</hi> in his Latin Tranſſation, <hi>i. e.</hi> Under the ſafeguard of the Law we were kept] <hi>ſhut up unto the Faith which ſhould afterwards be revealed.</hi> Where a manifeſt Alluſion is made, or rather a real Expoſition, by way of Anti-Type, anſwering to that Old Teſtament-Type of the Man-ſlayer, that was kept ſafe in the Cuſtody of the City of Refuge, though as a Priſoner, or confined, until he heard of the Death of the High Prieſt. Now let the Intelligent Reader judge, whether there be any real difference in Senſe betwixt <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words, <hi>Unto the Faith which ſhould afterwards be revealed,</hi> and my Words, <hi>Till the Faith come to be revealed;</hi> and if my Words infer the Revolutions, do not <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words infer them as much, or rather more? he uſing the Word <hi>afterwards,</hi> which I uſe not. Well, if they judge me guilty of the Revolutions, and condemn me to be an Apoſtate, and gone from Truth on that account, while they give me ſo good Company, as <hi>Moſes, David, Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> I need not fear great Reproach to fall on me for the ſame. But in very deed, they ſaid well, that I dare not defend it, as I never did; but this not daring to defend it, did not proceed in me,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47493:19"/>
nor doth from fear of being defamed; for if I were perſwaded and aſſured of it, as I am of the great Truths of the Chriſtian Faith, I ſhould not fear to avouch it. But ſeeing I pretend to no ſuch aſſurance in the caſe, as I never did, nor ever was poſitive to conclude it ſo much as in my ſecret thoughts, therefore I let it alone, neither juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying nor condemning what I have no certain knowledge of. And but that it would be too tedious a digreſſion, and not ſo proper here I could eaſily ſhew how weak their Arguments are againſt it, as it is common to them as well as others, to uſe weak Arguments to defend Truth, and oppoſe what they call Errour. And let them make the worſt of it they can, ſuppoſe that twelve Years ago, moſt of which time ſince they have owned me in Unity with them, I was in an Error in holding the Revolutions, will that prove I hold them ſtill? And ſeeing they judge me changed greatly in my Principles of late Years, why may they not judge me alſo changed in that? Or what ground have they to think I am not? If they ſay, becauſe I have not cleared my ſelf of the Charge: I ſay, I have done it ſufficiently ſeveral times in Print, and oft by Word of Mouth, That I hold it not either as any Article of the Chriſtian Faith, or as any poſitive Dogma in Philoſophy; yet I dare not, nor will not poſitively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it univerſally, until I ſee better and ſtronger Arguments than they have as yet brought againſt it. And if it be ſo great and dangerous an Error, why do they not refute it in Print, and Anſwer to all theſe things brought in favour of it, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Hypotheſis in the 200 Queries, which hath been in Print upwards of 12 Years? For they have Scribled and Printed many Books, on Matters far leſs material than this is. But ſince <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> hath Printed that which I committed to him as a Secrecy, without my Conſent, its well it was no ſuch Matter as might have brought any real Infamy on me, its too probable if he could have revealed any Secret that would have taken away my Life, he would have done it. But I had no ſuch Secret to impart to him, or any, that I need be afraid or aſhamed for their revealing it.</p>
            <p>Pag. 33. In their Head on the Glorified Bodies of Chriſt and the Saints, they are Guilty of ſuch groſs Perverſions, as none but Men infatuated would be: They infer, <q>That I have very Carnal Conceptions of the Reſurrection at preſent, like thoſe Sadduces, <hi>Matth</hi> 22 29. And why? Becauſe I ſay in <hi>Truth Adv.</hi> pag. 11. <hi>Paul</hi> diſtinguiſheth between the Belly and the Body, ſaying, <hi>God will deſtroy the Belly,</hi> but he doth not ſay he will deſtroy the Body; for ſeeing after the Reſurrection of the Dead, Men ſhall need none of the Meats of this corruptible World, nor ſhall they need a Belly to put them in, as Guts, and Draught, or any groſs parts as Men have now.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let the <hi>Reader</hi> obſerve theſe mens Infatuation and Nonſenſe: Do theſe Words prove that I have Carnal Conceptions of the Reſurrection, like thoſe <hi>Sadduces?</hi> Did not the <hi>Sadduces</hi> altogether deny the Reſurrection? But doth my ſaying, that after the Reſurrection of the Dead, they ſhall need neither Belly, Guts, nor Draught, nor any groſs parts, prove that they ſhall have them? O aſtoniſhing Blindneſs! And they are again guilty of the ſame Perverſion, or rather downright Forgery, in their pag. 34. <hi>ad finem,</hi> by their moſt falſe inſinuating againſt me, as if I did hold, <q>That the Reſurrection-Bodies of the Saints ſhall have Belly, Guts and Draught: For (ſay they) had G. K. retained theſe Sentiments (of Spiritual Bodies) when he wrote his bulky Book, ſtiled <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> he needed not have told us of Belly, Guts, and Draught.</q> But how did I tell them, that Men after the Reſurrection ſhall have them? By no means, but that they ſhould not have them, becauſe they ſhall have no need of them; and ſurely what they need not, they ſhall not have; as <hi>not to need,</hi> in Scripture-phraſe, is <hi>not to have,</hi> Rev. 21. 23. But that I remain in my Ancient Faith of the Reſurrection-Body as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is clear from that very Book, cited by them, to wit, That the Body that is raiſed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47493:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhall be a Spiritual Body, not groſs material Fleſh, but wonderfully changed in manner and condition, yet retaining the ſame Subſtance, the Husk or droſly part excepted; ſee particularly pag. 113, and 119. <hi>ad finem.</hi> And that this was my Faith thirty Years ago, is evident from my Anſwer to the 30 Queries of the Biſhop of <hi>Aberdene</hi> above-mentioned, and particularly noticed in the Collection of <hi>R. Barclay</hi>'s Books, called <hi>Truth Triumphant,</hi> pag. 2. In which Anſwer that was extant thirty Years ago, I expreſly ſay, in anſwer to the Biſhop's Queſtion, which was, <hi>Shall that ſame Body in Subſtance which dyeth, be raiſed again at the last Day?</hi> Anſwer, Yea, as far as a Natural Body, and Spiritual Body is the ſame: It is ſown a Natural Body, it is raiſed a Spiritual Body. Where it is plain, I both believed and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it ſhall be the ſame Body in Subſtance that dyeth, and ſhall be raiſed, though wonderfully changed in Condition and Quality from Natural to Spiritual. And this Anſwer was given in the Year 1666. being the third Year after I came among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and which I gave, conform to <hi>John Crooks</hi> Words in his <hi>Truths Principles,</hi> wherein I judged him (before ever I ſaw him) to be of the ſame Mind and Faith with me, in that great Article of the Chriſtian Faith, as well as in others; and ſince that, I have ſpoke with him, and had it from his own Mouth.</p>
            <p>Pag. 35. As to their 5th Head, concerning Water-Baptiſm and the Supper, whereon they ſpend ſeven pages, reciting ſome Paſſages in my former Books, with their Uncharitable Obſervations, and they are at great pains to ſhow an Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency and Contradiction betwixt my former Books, and my late Book, called <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> in reference to Water-Baptiſm, and the Supper, and that from ſome few Queries I propoſed at the end of that Book, only propoſed by way of Query, and not as Poſitive Concluſions; for I expreſly diſtinguiſh them from the Poſitive Concluſions going before, being each ten in number. And as to the Ten Poſitions, I judge many or moſt called <hi>Quakers,</hi> of the more intelligent ſort will ſtand by them, and may well enough own them, without any Inconſiſtency to their former Principles. And here I appeal to the Impartial Readers, whither it be not great diſingenuity in them, to charge theſe Queries (ſimply propoſed by me as Queries, but plainly diſtinguiſhed from Poſitions) upon me, as plain Poſitions when to ſome of their unſound Aſſertions expreſſed as Queries, but whoſe plain Senſe did import them to be Poſitions, they have made that excuſe, They did but Query, as lately at <hi>Turners-Hall</hi> ſome of <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Advocates did plead in his behalf. <hi>Is this to do as they would be done by?</hi> And how extreamly Uncharitable they ſhow themſelves, not to me only, but to all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> in ſo ſeverely accuſing me, for my Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Title to theſe Queries, ſaying—tending to Love, Peace, and Unity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Sincere Profeſſors of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ;</hi> who hold the Head, and build on the true Foundation, and yet differ in ſome leſſer matters, they ſo ſeverely tax me for this, as by their Cenſure it is evident, they think none ſuch to be found in all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> but themſelves, who hold the Head, and build on the true Foundation: for thus they ſay, <hi>VVhich whoſoever pleaſes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the reading on, will ſee whoſe Communion he labours to inſinuate himſelf into next, as holding the Head, and only differing in ſome leſſer Matters.</hi> But unleſs they be ſo Unchriſtianly uncharitable, (as they too evidently ſhow they are) as to judge none in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> differing from them in Profeſſion, to hold the Head, or are ſincere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but they only) Why ſhould I be blamed for own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Chriſtian Communion with them, in things that are not ſimply unlawful? Ought I not to be of <hi>David</hi>'s Mind, who ſaid, <hi>I am a Companion of all them that fear thee?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But more particularly as to the Caſe of <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> as I have freely declared of late Years, <hi>viva voce,</hi> ſo now as freely I publiſh it in Print, That I am not aſhamed to own my general Miſtakes I have been under concerning divers
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47493:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Places of Scriptures, particularly relative to Water-Baptiſm and the Supper, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. and ſome other places of Scripture, relative to ſome other matters, eſpecially in the Miſapplication of ſome places, to prove certain Truths, which theſe places did not prove, (a thing but too common to many Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to none more than to ſome called Quakers) for though every place of Scripture prove ſome Truth, yet every place proves not that Truth in particular which ſome may bring for to prove it; and I am ſo far from being aſhamed to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh this Confeſſion, that I have great Peace and Joy in it; and I alſo declare, that I am juſtly aſhamed, that I have been ſo long deceived and byaſſed with ſuch weak Arguments, as both they called Friends and I have uſed, (being too much influenced and byaſſed by their pretended authority) to perſwade and draw away the Minds of People from the true Senſe of theſe places of Scripture. And the Arguments that we have moſtly uſed againſt theſe two things, are ſo weak, that they have the ſame force againſt the Bible it ſelf, and all Books and outward Teſtimonies, and outward acts of Worſhip, and therefore are void in themſelves; for ſeeing they have no force againſt the latter, they have as little againſt the former. However I continue in my faithful Teſtimony againſt the abuſe of theſe things, and the dead, empty and formal way that too many practiſe them; and except the Lord be found to bleſs and accompany them who uſe them, with his Power and Spirit, they are but as empty Shadows, and Shells: But who find the Lord to bleſs them with his Preſence, I judge them not; and in this I am not ſingular, for divers of good Note among the People called Quakers, even Preachers, have ſaid the ſame, or equivalent, as particularly <hi>John Crook,</hi> and <hi>Robert Barclay:</hi> And it can no more be an evidence of my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, to correct my former Miſtakes on theſe two places of Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26 Which miſtakes of mine, were, That I judged the Apoſtles were not commanded to practiſe theſe things, and did not practiſe them by Command, but by Permiſſion, of which I am now convinced of the contrary, more than it will prove <hi>John Crook</hi> an Apoſtate, which they will not dare to ſay, who hath owned the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> 'That the Apoſtles and Primitive Believers did do theſe things by Command. And <hi>J. N.</hi> in his <hi>Love to the Lost,</hi> hath ſaid as much: Yea, both <hi>J. N.</hi> and <hi>Stephen Criſp,</hi> allow the practiſe of the <hi>Supper</hi> at this Day to weak Believers, as is evident from their Books in Print.</p>
            <p>Pag. 43. They blame me for oppoſing it as an Error, That the Garden of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe was ſome part of this viſible Earth; and for my ſaying the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated <hi>to dreſs,</hi> ſignifies to Work in it, blaming my ſaying, <q>It cannot be well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that it needed Dreſſing after the manner of our common Gardens.</q> Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> hath approved this Book, and boaſts that I have fallen into other Hands to deal with me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us ſee how their Hands at preſent agree: Ye ſee they blame me for oppoſing it as an Error, that the Garden of Paradiſe was ſome part of this Viſible Earth, and will needs have that it needed Dreſſing, after the manner of our common Gardens. But in plain Contradiction to this, <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> in his Printed Book, called, <hi>A Serious Account, in</hi> 35 <hi>Reaſons,</hi> &amp;c. Giveth this as one of his 35 Reaſons, why the People called Quakers have left the Men called Prieſts, pag. 23. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 9. <q>Alſo the Prieſts Ignorance and Groſs Darkneſs (ſaith he) hath appeared, who have affirmed, <hi>That the forbidden Fruit,</hi> which the Serpent tempted <hi>Eve</hi> to eat of, <hi>was an Apple:</hi> From which Dream of theirs the picture of a Snake, and an Apple in its Mouth in a Tree, with the Image of a Man a Woman, are ſet up at the beginning of Bibles, and in many other places; from which ſome have imagined that the Serpent which beguiled <hi>Eve</hi> was a Viſible Creature or Beaſt of the Field, which for that time had power to ſpeak, and to preſent an Apple to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Eve</hi> withal; when as God ſaid to Man and Woman before the Fall, <hi>Behold I have given you every Herb, hearing Seed, which is upon the face of all the Earth; and</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:47493:21"/>
                  <hi>every Tree, in the which is the fruit of a Tree yielding ſeed, to you it ſha'l be for Meat,</hi> Gen. 1. 29. and the fruit of ſuch a Tree that beareth ſeed, is an Apple; So that could not be the Forbidden Fruit And the Serpent was that which tempted Man from the Simplicity of the Truth, and through ſubtilty led him out from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and Life (wherein God had placed him) to feed upon the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, which was deſirable to the Carnal, or Woman's part, that was not content with the pure, innocent and ſimple Being wherein God at firſt placed Man over the reſt of the Creation.</q> Now if the Trees of the Garden were not viſible, and particularly the Tree of the forbidden Fruit, as G. W. ſaith it was not, then to be ſure the Garden by his judgment was not viſible, as an Apple, or any other viſible Fruit growing on this viſible Earth; and ſeeing he gives this as a Reaſon, why he left the Men he calleth Prieſts: And it is now his own Faith, by the ſame Reaſon, all the Quakers ſhould leave him. In the next place, let us hear what <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſaith in that famous Book, called his <hi>Journal,</hi> pag. 17. <hi>ad finem.</hi> 
               <q>Now (ſaith he) was, I come up in Spirit through the Flaming Sword into the Paradiſe of God, all things were new, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> I appeal to all Intelligent Readers, whether G. F. did mean by the Paradiſe or Garden, here any part of this Viſible Earth? And if any think, he meant it of any part of this viſible Earth; What that part was? unleſs they will ſay, it was that Mountain in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> he mentions, where he had his Viſion; but ſurely that could not be Paradiſe, for the Barrenneſs of it. A third Evidence for me and againſt theſe Men that have given out this Book, is <hi>William Shewen,</hi> a great Man among them, lately deceaſed, who to perſwade us of his Infallibility, hath told us, <hi>Treatiſe of Thoughts,</hi> pag. 14. <q>That he cannot write contrary to Scripture, being in unity with them.</q> And pag. 19, 20. plainly tells us, <q>That the Man was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with the Beauty of an Apple; or <hi>ſome other outward Fruit,</hi> nor by the Talk or Perſwaſion of any Creature, like our Engliſh Snakes, as vain Man in his carnal Mind imagins.</q> So we ſee his Cenſure of <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> and <hi>J. Pennington,</hi> that they are vain, who have ſo imagined in their Carnal Minds How <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> will clear himſelf of this and many other groſs Self-contradictions, I leave to the Tryal.</p>
            <p>Pag. 36. Their Abuſe and Perverſon is manifeſt, in ſeeking to fix a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on me for affirming in my Book, <hi>Help in time of Need,</hi> 
               <q>That the Scriptures are not that Word, [to wit, that living eſſential Word] more than a Map or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> is <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>London;</hi> or the Image of Caeſar is Caeſar, or Bread and Wine is the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</q> And for Querying, <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> Que. 5. <q>Whether it may not be ſaid, there is one Baptiſm, as that there is one Land ca led <hi>America,</hi> though the Map or Figure of it is alſo called <hi>America,</hi> even as there is but one Spiritual Baptiſm, with the Holy Ghoſt, though the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baptiſm with Water is alſo called Baptiſm.</q> Now beſide that this laſt is only a Query, but let it paſs for a Poſition, let the Intelligent judge what Contradiction is here, or leaſt Inconſiſtency. Contradictories can never be true, but both theſe are true. 1. The Scriptures are not that Living and Eſſential Word which is Chriſt, this is a Truth that all called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> acknowledge: But that they may be called the Word, as a Map of <hi>America</hi> is called <hi>America,</hi> I never denyed; but have oft ſaid, and which is agreeable to many <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Writers, who have uſed ſuch a phraſe, a Map or Scheme of the Goſpel. Nor is the Bread and Wine the Body and Blood of Chriſt, though it be ſo called: Now if theſe Men deny this to be a Truth, they muſt hold with <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that the Bread and Wine is really the Body and Blood of Chriſt. 2. That though there is but one Spiritual Baptiſm, yet that the outward Baptiſm with Water, is alſo called <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is alſo true; for <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm with Water is called in Scripture the Baptiſm of <hi>John.</hi> And after they have thus ſhown their own Folly and Ignorance, in a ſcoffing Spirit, they call me <hi>Rabby,</hi> though its the known way of the Quakers not to call a Man <hi>Maſter,</hi> that is in Hebrew <hi>Rabbi, Matth.</hi> 23. 7, 8. yet to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47493:21"/>
a Scoffing Humour, they will tranſgreſs their Rule. <hi>Here this Rabbi</hi> (ſay they) <hi>hath foiled himſelf ſorely.</hi> But let the Intelligent judge, whether they have not foiled themſelves ſorely all along their abuſive and ſcandalous Book, that [excepting theſe Sound Paſſages and Teſtimonies, they have collected out of my Books, which greatly make for me, and ſhow that I am conſtant in my Principles, as to the Faith of Chriſt] contains little elſe, than a heap of Falſities, and Perverſions. But that they ſay, <hi>He once boaſted (in his</hi> Serious Appeal) pag. 29. <hi>That he hath the Gifts both of Sound Knowledge and Expreſſion, with manifold other Mercies beſtowed on him:</hi> In this they falſly accuſe me. for there is nothing in that place, that either expreſſes or implyeth any boaſt in the leaſt. For whereas my Opponent had charged me with marveous Ignorance, Falſhood and Giddineſs I ſaid [among other things] I doubt not but judicious and im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>partial Readers, who compare his Books and mine, will have another judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me and acknowledge to God's praiſe, the Gifts both of Sound Knowledge <q>and Expreſſion, with his manifold other Mercies beſtowed on m, for which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to Praiſe him forever.</q> But to make it look like a Boaſt, they leave out theſe laſt Words, and alſo the foregoing Words; and its evident I uſed theſe Words only Comparatively, and not Abſolutely; for I never judged my ſelf abſolutely Infallible, nor have been a Self-Praiſer, as too many of them are; and I may now ſay, let their Books who have appeared againſt me of late, as <hi>W. Penn G. Whitehead, T. Ellwood,</hi> and others be compared with mine, and I doubt not but judicious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Readers will have another judgment concerning me, than theſe my prejudiced Adverſaries, and acknowledge to God's Praiſe, the Gifts of ſound Knowledge and Expreſſion that God hath given me, for which I deſire forever to Praiſe him; but this I underſtand only Comparatively, for I never had ſuch thoughts of my ſelf, nor have, but that the Sentiments of my Mind, and Expreſſions of my Mouth and Pen, in divers things, may admit of Correction, though as to the main, every true Chriſtian as well as I, may ſay, We have a Sound Knowledge and Faith. And whereas they paſs another Scoff upon me, pag. 34. calling my Book, <hi>Truth Advanced,</hi> His bulky Book; which is but of ſmall bulk in compariſon of the bulky Volumns of <hi>G. Whitehead, W Penn,</hi> and divers others: I am not doubtful to ſay, that Intelligent Readers who compare their great bulky Books with that one ſmall bulky Book of mine, will ſay, there is more Sound matter of Doctrine in it, and the Contents of it are more for Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than in their great bulky Books: Yet I have been ſo modeſt (a thing I never found in any of them to acknowledge, that in ſome things I may receive ſome Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and better information. See my Pref. <hi>Truth Adv.</hi> pag. 45.</p>
            <p>Pag 44. They quarrel my expounding <q>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>'s hiding themſelves among the Trees of the Garden, to be in a Tree of the Garden, and that one Tree may be well underſtood,</q> to be the divine Mercy or Clemency.</p>
            <p>I had ſaid in my Book, <hi>Truth Adv.</hi> the Hebrew doth bear it, <hi>in a Tree of the Garden,</hi> pag. 25. But I muſt excuſe their Ignorance in the Hebrew, that they will not admit of this true Tranſlation: And are they not Carnally Minded, to think that <hi>Adam</hi> thought he could hide himſelf either among the Trees of an outward Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or in any one Tree of it, ſo as God might not ſee him; this is to think, at leaſt, that <hi>Adam</hi> was an <hi>Anthropomorphit</hi> or <hi>Mugletonian,</hi> as having ſuch a groſs Opinion, that God had bodily Eyes as a Man, and that an outward Tree could hide him from God. And their Argument is as fooliſh, againſt my ſaying, <q>That Tree might be the Divine Mercy or Clemency, They ſay,</q> 
               <hi>The Divine Mercy is in Chriſt Jeſus, and if they were got there, when they heard the Voice of the Lord God walking in the Garden, they ſhould not have been afraid, for they were already ſaefe.</hi> But doth not the Scripture ſay, God's Mercies are over all his Works? and doth not the Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and Mercy of God extend to them that are not yet in Chriſt? have they not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47493:22"/>
that underſtanding, to diſtinguiſh betwixt the Mercy of God in general to all Men, and his Mercy in ſpecial to Believers; and ſeeing they will needs have this Place where <hi>Adam</hi> hid, ſome outward Trees on this Earth, by the ſame Carnal Mind they muſt underſtand, that this walking of God, was an outward and Bodily walking, and his Voice an outward and Bodily Voice: and ſo they make not only <hi>Adam,</hi> but <hi>Moſes</hi> who writ theſe Words, to be an <hi>Anthropomorphit</hi> and <hi>Mugletonian,</hi> or rather the Father and Founder of the Anthropomorphits and Mugletonians; for <hi>Mugleton</hi> himſelf draweth his Arguments from his Carnal Underſtanding of theſe Places, as theſe Men do.</p>
            <p>Pag. 44 They alſo blame me, for ſaying, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>'s Nakedneſs was the fruit of Tranſgreſſion. And they argue againſt it, by Quering, <hi>What Sign or Token of Impudence is it in People to endeavour to cover their Nakedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I <hi>Anſwer;</hi> Taking Nakedneſs Metaphorically, as I do in that place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. as it is taken, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17, 18. It is a ſign of Impudence to endeavour to cover their Nakedneſs: Have not ſome called <hi>Quakers</hi> gone naked through the Streets, as a ſign of the People's Nakedneſs: And what Nakedneſs was that? Is not Sin a Nakedneſs, meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically taken? and when Men cover their Sins, with falſe and ſinful Excuſes, it is a ſign of their Impudence, as is too manifeſt in theſe men, <hi>George Whitehead</hi> and <hi>John Pennington<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And what Nakedneſs was that of the Serpent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1. for as I ſaid in <hi>Truth Adv.</hi> p. 25. the Hebrew Word is the ſame in both places, viz. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 25. and 3. 1. Was it bodily Nakedneſs that he wanted ſome outward Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to cover it? And can we ſuppoſe, that God who cloatheth every Lily of the Field, made <hi>Adam</hi> without a ſuitable Cloathing; Did he not Crown him with Glory and Honour? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 5. And if his Head was not naked how could his Body be naked? But it is not to be ſuppoſed, that <hi>Aadm's</hi> Cloathing before the Fall was any other than that Beauty and Glory that God had put on him, both with reſpect to Soul and Body; but this groſs Ignorance of theſe Men here, touching <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſtate before the Fall, is like that of their Ignorant Brother of the Miniſtry, <hi>Jacob Talner,</hi> who aſſerted in a late Meeting at <hi>Turner</hi>'s<hi>-Hall,</hi> before ſome hundreds <hi>That</hi> Adam <hi>before the Fall, had neither Holineſs nor Wiſdom, nor Righteouſneſs;</hi> and denyed that <hi>either Spiritual or Temporal Death was the effect of</hi> Adam's <hi>Fall;</hi> and uſed the very ſame Argument againſt G. K s Miniſtry, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> uſed againſt the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and all <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Miniſters, calling for Miracles, or Church-Authority. Another moſt fooliſh and ignorant Argument they bring againſt my ſaying, God cloathed them inwardly with the Righteouſneſs of the Lamb. They ſay, <hi>Did he cloath them with the Righteouſneſs of the Lamb, and yet at the ſame time debar them acceſs to the Tree of Life?</hi> See <hi>Gen.</hi> 3 21, 22. What ſtrange Doctrine is this. But <hi>at the ſame time</hi> is their addition: If by <hi>the ſame time,</hi> they mean the ſame Inſtant, or Hour: I ſay nay. But the time was not long betwixt their Fall, and their Reſtoration, ſo far as they had acceſs to Chriſt, ſignified by the Tree of Life. What they call mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Doctrine, of <hi>a Body a top of a Body,</hi> is none of mine, but their own invention, and fooliſh arguing. Is a Maſs, wherein there is a mixture of Gold and Droſs, a Body a top of a Body? They quarrel with my Tranſlation, for rendring the Word <hi>Rib</hi> to be <hi>Side;</hi> and though I bring ſeveral places of Scripture to prove it a true Tranſlation, they bring nothing to diſprove it. Surely a Side of <hi>Adam</hi> bears more proportion for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Wife, than a Rib. <hi>Plato</hi> a Heathen, had a better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Man's ſtate before the Fall, then theſe Men have, for all their high pretence to high divine Illumination, and they who in their conceit are firſt in the ranck of Chriſtians, are laſt in many reſpects for their extream Ignorance, beyond moſt Profeſſors of Chriſtianity,</p>

I ſhall not need to Notice his idle and impertinent Clamour, againſt what he calleth my Arbitrary and Extrajudicial Proceedings, and new Court of Judicatory, and as contrary to the intent of the Law, having ſufficiently anſwered it in any Preface to the Printed <hi>Narrative.</hi> But I cannot but obſerve his great Hypocriſie and Impudence in his ſaying, <hi>He is not conſcious to himſelf of Error, either in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Reſurrection, Chriſt's Satisfaction, or Sacrifice, or his viſible coming again, in his glorified Body without us, to raiſe the Dead at the Great Day of Judgement.</hi> Seeing I have proved him Guilty in all theſe things, as manifeſtly as the Light at Noon-day in the Printed <hi>Narrative,</hi> and in that Meeting at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> 11th. 4th. Month, 1696. to which I expect his Anſwer, before they Print any more. But whereas he accuſeth me, That I have dealt very unfairly by him, in leaving out [Blood and Bones] after the Words, Body of Fleſh. I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> There was no unfairneſs in it, ſeeing it was no deſigned Omiſſion, but an overſight either in the Print, or Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing; and the adding <hi>Blood and Bones</hi> to the Word <hi>Fleſh,</hi> doth not in the leaſt excuſe his groſs Error. For if Chriſt did riſe with the Subſtance of his Fleſh, ſo did he with the Subſtanc of Blood and Bones; for he could not eat and drink after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, without Blood in his Body: and if he hath the Subſtance of his Fleſh now in Heaven, though wonderfully changed in Conditon from Animal to Spiritual, ſurely he hath alſo the Subſtance of his Blood [ſo much as remained in his Body] and alſo of his Bones. But that he ſeems, pag. 6. to apply my words, <hi>the Husk,</hi> or <hi>Droſſy part,</hi> not the true Body, to Chriſt's Body; as if I held his Body had any husk or droſs in it, is unfair in him, for I hold no ſuch thing, nor ever did.</p>
            <p>He is very impertinent and weak in his complaining, That I gave them no Copy of that he falſly calls the Particulars of my Indictment, or Charge before Tryal, or of the Books and Pages referred unto therein for a due preparation to anſwer, alledging, I would not be ſo ſerved or ſurpriſed. I ſent them, and particularly I ſent him to his Houſe, a printed Copy of the Advertiſement, wherein the Four Heads were particularly expreſſed, that I charged them with, and which I have made good againſt them. <hi>G. W.</hi> that proſeſſeth ſo great skill in Law, and has more Law than true Goſpel in his Books, knoweth that it is not the manner of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments, ſuppoſe my printed Advertiſement had been ſuch as it was not, to put in the Evidence againſt the Delinquents or Criminals, and were they armed with Truth and Righteouſneſs, they needed not have complained of want of due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration (its odd and a new ſort of Language for one called a <hi>Quaker,</hi> to tell us of his not being prepared) the Scripture ſaith (1 Pet. 3. 15.) <hi>Be ready always to give an Anſwer to every Man that asketh you a Reaſon of the Hope that is in you.</hi> When I was moſt falſly and uncharitably accuſed by <hi>John Voughton, John Field,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Ellwood,</hi> at the Yearly Meeting, 1694.

I had offered in Print before to <hi>Tho.

               <hi>A</hi> POSTSCRIPT,</head>
            <argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>Containing an Earneſt Expoſtulation with the moſt Pious and Learned, whether in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>or among other Proteſtant Diſſenters; and a ſerious Invitation unto them, to employ ſome of their Time and Labour, by their Pious and Learned Writings, to oppoſe and refute thoſe vile Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors boldly avowed, and publickly broached, in the late Printed Books of ſome Leading Men among a Gang and ſort of</hi> Quakers.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IT may ſeem ſtrange, how it comes to paſs, that while ſo many Pious and Learned Men are judged to be found in this Nation, not only of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but among the Diſſenters and Nonconformiſts, there are found ſo few among them all, that do imploy their Gifts to oppoſe ſuch Vile Errors as are boldly and avowedly promoted among a ſort and Gang of the People called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, not only as bad as any Popery, but much worſe than the worſt of Popery, in divers reſpects; and I am confident if ſuch Antichriſtian Errors and Hereſies were but the tenth part ſo avowedly broached in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any where elſe, in Popiſh Countries, theſe eſteemed Watchmen among them, would be more alarmed to oppoſe them by Word and Writing, than moſt among Proteſtants do, which would ſeem to caſt a great Reflexion on the Proteſtant Churches, if ſome able Men, and of good eſteem among them, both for Piety and Sound Knowledge, be not awakened to beſtow ſome of their time and labour by their Writings to oppoſe ſuch Vile Errors; and ſuch a Work would be ſo far from unbecoming the ableſt and moſt valuable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in this Nation, for Piety and Learning, that it would turn much to their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and real Advantage, to beſtir themſelves in this Work. It frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth, that Books are more valued, and the Contents of them the more regarded and conſidered, and the more univerſally read and recommended, that Perſons of publick Note and Fame, when Pious and Learned are the Authors of them.</p>
            <p>And whereas many of the chiefeſt Teachers and Leaders among the People called Quakers, have formerly with great boldneſs, provoked ſuch as have differed from them to publick Diſputes, <hi>viva voce,</hi> and have oft gloried over them, who refuſed to anſwer them, that their Cauſe was bad, and that they had not Truth on their ſide; and in theſe days there was no ſuch Cry to be heard from them, as now, That ſuch publick Diſputes will offend Authority, and break the Civil Peace; yea, how oft have ſome of their Teachers aſſaulted the National Miniſters in the Face of their Congregations, and provoked them to diſpute with them; and on their refuſal, have cryed out againſt them to be Fugitives and Hirelings when the ſaid National Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters way of Religion and Worſhip was approved by Authority, and that of the People called Quakers was not: Would it not therefore be a moſt equal, reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and commendable Practiſe for any Perſons of true Piety and ſolid Learning, moved with the Zeal of God's Glory, and love of Truth, and with a Holy Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt theſe Vile Errors that are publickly avouched by ſome Leading Men
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47493:23"/>
among the Quakers, as appeareth both by their former and later Printed Books, and with a tender Compaſſion to the Souls of ſo many Thouſands in this Nation, that are in danger to periſh by the Infection of theſe Errors, openly and publickly to call them forth to a publick Hearing, and to preſs them by earneſt Perſwaſions, to retract and condemn thoſe vile and damnable Errors contained in their Books, or if they continue to juſtifie them, to refute them openly in the Face of their own Meetings, and in the preſence of them that do ſo much admire and follow them. <hi>And thus to ſerve them, at they have ſerved others; and with what Meaſure they have met to others, with the ſone to mete to them again.</hi> And it would be a Commendable and Praiſe-worthy thing, for the Civil Authority, to encourage ſuch a Practiſe throughout the Nation, that Men of true Piety and ſolid Learning might be allowed and Countenanced to Refute theſe Vile and Abominable Errors of theſe chief Teachers and Leaders anong them called Quakers, in their Meeting-Houſes, at the end of their Meetings, or at other fit times: Surely ſuch a Practiſe as this, as it is no ways inconſiſtent with the Civil Peace, and Liberty of Conſcience granted to Diſſenting Proteſtants, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding of the idle Clamour of ſuch Men, who have an Evil Conſcience and a lad Cauſe) would be more effectual to Preſerve the True <hi>Proteſtant Chriſtian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in theſe three Nations, than all the ſevere ways in former times uſed againſt then, of Fines, Impriſonments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though it is far from me to deſire the leaſt Suffrings to come on theſe Mens Perſons or Eſtates, yet if ſuch a zeal were raiſed in them bearing Authority in this Nation, to give order that all ſuch Books of them called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as can readily be found, (as great ſtore of ſuch there are) that contan ſuch Vile and Abominable Errors, to the diſhonour of the worthy Name of Chriſt and the Chriſtian Religion, and the great danger of many Souls, be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſearched and examined by the moſt Pious and Judicious Perſons in the Nation, and after due ſearch and Examination, be found guilty; that by publick Authority all ſuch Books may be ſuppreſſed and witneſſed againſt. I may freely ſay, theſe Men ſhould have no juſt Cauſe to Complain, that their Books ſhould be ſo dealt with, for they have done the like to Books that have oppoſed their groſs Errors, witneſs a Parcel of Books writ (by me) ſome Four Years ago, that came to <hi>London</hi> from <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> oppoſing the groſs Errors of ſome called Quakers in that Province, which were deſigned to have been Sold in ſingle Books, and diſperſed through City and Country for a general Service: But the Quakers here at <hi>London</hi> gave large Money to the Man that had them, that they might get them all into their Hands, on purpoſe to ſuppreſs them; as accordingly they did, and hinder the Service of them; and theſe very Books generally lie in theſe Mens Cuſtody ſuppreſſed unto this very Day, and ſome of them have burned, others have torn, and trod under Feet in open view, Books that have oppoſed their vile Errors.</p>

            <p>WHereas there is lately Printed a Scandalous Libel againſt me, with this Title, <hi>Maſter</hi> George Keith <hi>at Turners-Hall in</hi> Philpot<hi>-Lane,</hi> London, <hi>in</hi> 1696. <hi>contradicting,</hi> &amp;c. Signed only with two Letters, <hi>W. C.</hi> wherein he laboureth in vain to prove my Inconſiſtency and Contradiction, betwixt my Book of <hi>Immediate Revelation,</hi> and the late <hi>Exact Narrative;</hi> the Author of which
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47493:24"/>
Scandalous Libel, ſeemeth to profeſs himſelf to be a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but his Speech bewrayeth him to be a Counterfeit, and rather one of that Gang and ſort of Anti-Chriſt<hi>-Quakers,</hi> above-mentioned, ſeeing he doth ſo eagerly patronize them, againſt the known Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as well as of all true Chriſtians. I give this publick Intimation, that I deſire this <hi>W. C.</hi> to appear and meet me at any convenient time, at our Meeting-place at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> which time I allow him to appoint, and give Notice of before-hand; and I doubt not but by God's Aſſiſtance, to prove him guilty of divers Forgeries, and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Falſities, Perverſions, and Wreſtings of my Sound Woros, contained in his ſaid Scandalous Libel, together with his baſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions and Falſe Surmiſes againſt me. And if he refuſe this my fair Propoſal it will be manifeſt he is a Cowardly Spirit, and ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the dark, and as well Unmanly as Unchriſtian, thus in a Clandeſtine way by palpable Falſities and Perverſions, to ſeek to deceive his unwary Readers, and to divert me from a Buſineſs of greater Concern by his trifling. And I judge no Impartial Obſerver of the ſtate of this Controverſie betwixt my open and profeſſed Adverſaries, <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> and others of their party and me, will think me obliged to Print Anſwers to ſuch Clandeſtine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and Smiters in the dark, or to regard their Nameleſs Libels, which might prove as much an Unprofitable as an Endleſs Work.</p>
            <p>I alſo deſire the Friendly Reader to take notice, that the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and Explanations of ſome Paſſages contained in my former Books (which I have freely declared, did need Correction in ſome things, and Explanation in others) are in great part already given in this Treatiſe; and indeed the greateſt Miſtakes that I find I have been under, were my miſ-underſtanding theſe places of Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. and others the like places rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to theſe outward Practices of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper,</hi> which in the foregoing Treatiſe I have freely acknowledged; and this may ſuffice at preſent to ſilence the Clamour of ſuch that cry out, I ſhould firſt acknowledge my own Errors, before I charge others with their Errors: For as I had done it in general in the firſt place, ſo ſince I have done it in particular in great part, and may yet more fully do it, as God ſhall be pleaſed to give me an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. But I bleſs God I have no ſuch Errors to retract or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, as my Adverſaries have; for put all my Miſtakes and Errors together in one Bundle, and they will not weigh the one thouſand part of the weight that one of theſe four Errors do weigh, that I have proved my Adverſaries guilty of, both in the <hi>Exact Narrative,</hi> and in this fore-going Treatiſe, and in other late Treatiſes. And
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47493:24"/>
were but my Adverſaries ſo ſincere and ingenuous to acknowledge either in general, or in any particulars wherein they have been miſtaken, and need to correct their Sentiments, it would give great Satisfaction to many, as well as to me. But this they will hardly do, nay, it is impoſſible they can do it, ſo long as they ſeek to keep up in their credulous Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, their eſteem of their Infallibility; and beſide, to own that they are changed from their former Sentiments, would be either to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themſelves as great Apoſtates, as they now charge me to be for ſome ſmall change in me, touching leſſer Matters, or rather to clear me of that foul Charge of Apoſtacy they have ſo invidiouſly caſt upon me. And it is great diſ-ingenuity in them, and Hypocriſie, to blame me for ſaying, I did not know they held ſuch Principles, till of late times; for it is certain, that as theſe their Erronious Principles were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me, which I call <hi>Anti-Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Sadducean;</hi> ſo what they call my <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Prieſtly</hi> Principles, were unknown to them; or if they did know them, they were great Hypocrites if they judged them falſe, not to diſcover them before now. For whereas now they commonly ſay I hold Prieſts and Profeſſors Principles; I know no ſuch Prieſts and Profeſſors Principles that I now hold, but I am able to prove, I have held them ever ſince I came among the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> as touching all the Articles of Faith, commonly called the <hi>ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer credenda;</hi> and wherein I am changed in my Judgment, as to the Senſe of theſe places of Scripture, relating to Baptiſm and the Supper, I can prove my agreement with ſome of chiefeſt Note among the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> therefore for that I am no Apoſtate.</p>

                        <hi>Note,</hi> His abominable Forgeries and Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, in ſaying, I give all theſe Names he mentions p 11 to the Light within, which is a notorious Falſhood, as the Reader will ſee, that will be at the pains to view the ſeveral pages he refers to; for though ſome of theſe Names I give to the Light within, yet not all of them, but ſome I give to Chriſt, as he is both God and Man; and I divers times in that ſame Book, and near to theſe places that he cites, call the Light within a Meaſure of that Fulneſs of Life and Spirit, whoſe Fulneſs is in the Man Chriſt without us.</cell>
