            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Received yesternight,
your Lordships of
the 19 current; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you are pleased to obleige
me, not onely by extreame
gallant expressions of favour
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48918:3"/>
and kindnesse: but likewise
by taking so farre into your
care the expending of my
time during the tediousnesse
of my restraint, as to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to my reading a <hi>Booke,</hi>
that had received the honour
and safeguard of your appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
for both which I most
humbly thanke your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
And since I cannot, in
the way of gratefulnesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
unto your Lordship as
I would those hearty senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
I have of your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to me; I will at the least
endeavour, in the way of <hi>Duty</hi>
and observance, to let you see
how the little needle of my
Soule is throughly touched at
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48918:3"/>
the great loadstone of yours,
and followeth sudainely and
strongly which way soever
you becken it. In this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the magnetike motion,
was impatience to have the
<hi>Booke</hi> in my hands that your
Lordship gave so advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a character of; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I sent presently (as late as
it was) to <hi>Pauls</hi> Churchyard,
for this favourite of yours,
<hi>Religio Medici:</hi> which after a
while found me in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fit to receive a Blessing by a
visit from any of such Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeces
as you looke upon
with gracious eyes; For I was
newly gotten into my Bed.
This good natur'd creature I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48918:4"/>
could easily perswade to bee
my Bedfellow, and to wake
with mee as long as I had any
edge to entertaine my selfe
with the delights I sucked
from so noble a conversation.
And truely (my Lord) I clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not my eyes till I had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richt
my selfe with, (or at least
exactly surveyed) all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
that are lapped up in the
folds of those few sheets. To
returne onely a generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
of this curious
peece, or at large to admire the
authors Spirit and smartnes,
were too perfunctory an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
and too slight a one, to
so discerning and steddy an
eye as yours, after so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48918:4"/>
and encharged a sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
to read heedfully this
discourse. I will therefore
presume to blot a sheete or
two of paper with my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
upon sundry passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
through the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of it, as they shall occurre
to my remembrance. Which
now your Lordship knoweth
this packet is not so happy as
to carry with it any other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of my obsequious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to you; It will bee but
reasonable, you should even
here, give over your further
trouble of reading, what my
respect ingageth mee to the
writing of.</p>
            <p>Whose first steppe is inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48918:5"/>
and a well natur'd even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of <hi>Iudgement,</hi> shall bee
sure of applause and faire
hopes in all men for the rest
of his <hi>Iourney:</hi> And indeed
(my Lord) me thinketh this
Gentleman setteth out excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
poised with that happy
temper; and sheweth a great
deale of <hi>Iudicious</hi> piety in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a right use of the blind
zeale that <hi>Bigots</hi> loose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in. Yet I cannot satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
my doubts throughly, how
hee maketh good his profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to follow the great
wheele of the Church in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Divinity:</hi> which surely
is the solid Basis of true <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi>
for to doe so, without jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48918:5"/>
against the conduct of
that first mover by Eccentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and irregular motions, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigeth
one to yeeld a very du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
obedience to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations
of it without arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
to ones selfe a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ability in liking or misli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the faith, doctrine and
constitutions of that <hi>Church</hi>
which one looketh upon as
their North starre: <hi>Whereas if
I</hi> mistake not, this author ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth
the Church of <hi>England</hi>
not absolutely, but compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
with other reformed
Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My</hi> next reflection is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
what he hath sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
(most wittily) in severall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48918:6"/>
places, concerning the nature
and immortality of a humane
soule, and the condition and
state it is in, after the dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the body. And here
give me leave to observe what
our Countryman <hi>Roger Bacon</hi>
did long agoe; That those stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
who busie themselves
much with such notions, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
wholly to the fantasie, do
hardly ever become idoneous
for abstracted metaphysicall
speculations; the one having
bulky foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of matter, or
of the accidents of it, to settle
upon, (at the least, with one
foote:) The other flying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
even to a lessening
pitch, in the Subtile ayre; And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48918:6"/>
dingly it hath beene general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
noted, that the exactest Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians,
who converse
altogether with lines, figures,
and other differences of quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity;
have seldome proved e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
in Metaphysicks or
speculative Divinity. Nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
the professors of these
sciences, in the others arts.
Much lesse can it be expected
that an excellent Physitian
whose fancy is always fraught
with the materiall drugs that
hee prescribeth his <hi>Apothecary</hi>
to compound his Medicines
of; and whose hands are inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the cutting up, &amp; eies to
the inspection of anatomised
bodies; should easily, and with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48918:7"/>
successe, flye his thoughts at
so to wring a <hi>Game,</hi> as a pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect,
a Separated and unbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed
Soule; surely this acute
<hi>Authors</hi> sharpe wit, had hee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
applyed his studies that
way, would have beene able
to satisfie himselfe with lesse
labour, and others with more
plenitude, then it hath beene
the lot of so dull a braine as
mine, concerning the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of the <hi>Soule:</hi> And yet I
assure you (my Lord) the little
<hi>Philosophy</hi> that is allowed mee
for my share, demonstrateth
this proposition to mee, as
well as faith delivereth it:
<hi>which</hi> our <hi>Physician</hi> will not
admit in his.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:48918:7"/>To make good this asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
here, were very unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
since that to doe it exactly,
(and without exactnesse, it
were no demonstration) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
a totall Survey of the
whole science of <hi>Bodyes,</hi> and
of all the operations that wee
are conversant with, of a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall
creature; which I having
done, with all the succinctnes
I have beene able to explicate
so knotty a Subject with, hath
taken mee up in the first
draught neere two hundred
sheets of paper. I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take leave of this point
with onely this note, that I
take the immortality of the
<hi>Soule</hi> (under his favour) to bee
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48918:8"/>
of that nature, that to them
onely that are not versed in
the wayes of proving it by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
it is an article of faith; to
others, it is an evident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of demonstrative Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>And with a like short note
I shall observe how if hee had
traced the nature of the <hi>Soule</hi>
from its first principles, hee
could not have suspected it
should sleepe in the grave till
the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the body.
Nor would hee have permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his compassionative na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to imagine it belonged to
Gods mercy (as the <hi>Chiliasts</hi>
did) to change its condition
in those that are damned, from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48918:8"/>
paine to happines. For where
God should have done that,
hee must have made that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
Soule another crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
then what it was, (as to
make fire cease from being
hot, requireth to have it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
another thing then the
<hi>Element</hi> of fire;) since, that to
be in such a condition as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
us understand damned
Soules miserable, is a necessary
effect of the temper it is in,
when it goeth out of the <hi>Body,</hi>
and must necessarily (out of
its owne nature) remaine in,
unvariably for all eternity;
<hi>Though,</hi> for the conceptions
of the vulgar part of mankind,
(who are not capable of such
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48918:9"/>
abstruse notions) it be stiled
(and truly too) the sentence
and punishment of a severe
<hi>Iudge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am extreamely pleased
with him, when he saith there
are not impossibilities enough
in <hi>Religion</hi> for an active faith:
And no whit lesse, when in
<hi>Philosophy</hi> hee will not bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with such naked termes
as in <hi>Schools</hi> use to be obtruded
upon easie mindes, when the
<hi>Masters</hi> fingers are not strong
enogh to untie the knots pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto them. I confesse,
when I enquire what light (to
use our Authors example) is,
I should bee as well contented
with his Silence, as with his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48918:9"/>
telling mee it is <hi>Actus perspicui;</hi>
unlesse hee explicate clearely
to me what those words mean,
which I finde very few goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to do. Such meate they
swallow whole, and eject it as
entire. But were such things,
scientifically, and methodical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared, they would bee of
extreame satisfaction, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.
And that worke taketh
up the greatest part of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
mentioned treatise. For
I endeavour to shew by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
progresse, and not by
Leapes, all the motions of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
&amp; unto them to fit intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligibly
the termes used by her
best Secretaries: whereby all
wilde fantasticke qualities and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48918:10"/>
moods (introduced for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges
of ignorance) are bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
from my commerce.</p>
            <p>In the next place (my <hi>Lord</hi>)
I shall suspect that our author
hath not penetrated into the
bottome of those conceptions
that deepe Schollers have
taught us of <hi>Eternity.</hi> Methink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
hee taketh it for an infinite
extension of time, and a never
ending revolution of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
succession: which is no
more like <hi>Eternity,</hi> then a
grosse body is like to a pure
<hi>Spirit.</hi> Nay, such an infinity of
revolutions, is demonstrable
to bee a contradiction and
impossible. In the state of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
there is no succession,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48918:10"/>
no change, no variety. Soules
or <hi>Angells,</hi> in that condition,
doe not so much as change a
thought. All things, notions,
and actions, that every were,
are, or shal bee in any creature,
are actually present to such an

                  </gap>ologie,</hi> and having recourse
to beatifike vision to make
good my tenet, (for so, onely
glorified creatures should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
such immense know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge)
but out of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Nature and <hi>Reason,</hi> and
from thence shal demonstrate
it to belong to the lowest
Soule of the ignorantest
wretch whiles hee lived in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48918:11"/>
this world, since damned in
<hi>Hell.</hi> A bold undertaking you
will say; But I confidently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
my selfe to it. Vpon this
occasion occurreth also a great
deale to bee said of the nature
of <hi>Predestination</hi> (which by
the short touches our Author
giveth of it, I doubt hee quite
mistakes) and how it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable
<hi>Series</hi> and chaine of
causes, producing infallible
(and in respect of them, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary)
effects: But that is too
large a <hi>Theame</hi> to unfold here;
too vast an <hi>Ocean</hi> to describe,
in the scant Map of a Letter.
And therefore I will refer that
to a fitter opportunity, fearing
I have already too much tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48918:11"/>
upon your Lordships
patience; but that indeed I
hope you have not had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to read thus far.</p>
            <p>I am sure (my <hi>Lord</hi>) that
you (who never forgot any
thing, which deserved a roome
in your memory) doe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
how wee are told, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byssus
abyssum invocat:</hi> So here
our Author, from the abysse
of <hi>Predestination,</hi> falleth into
that of the <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Persons</hi>
consistent with the indivisibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the divine nature: And
out of that (if I be not excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
deceived) into a third,
of mistaking, when he goeth
about to illustrate this admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
mysteryby a wild discourse
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48918:12"/>
of a <hi>Trinity</hi> in our <hi>Soules.</hi> The
dint of wit is not forcible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to dissect such tough
matter; wherein al the obscure
glimmering wee gaine of that
inaccessible light, commeth
to us cloathed in the darke
weeds of negations, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
little can wee hope to
meete with any positive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
to parallel it withall.</p>
            <p>I doubt, hee also mistakenth,
and imposeth upon the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
<hi>Schooles,</hi> when he intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
that they gainesay this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
worlds being but a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
or shadow of the invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
&amp; intellectual: which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Philosophising,</hi> hee attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth
to <hi>Hermes Trismegistus;</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:48918:12"/>
but is every where to be
met with in <hi>Plato;</hi> and is
raised since to a greater height
in the Christian Schooles.</p>
            <p>But I am sure hee learned in
no good Schoole, nor sucked
from any good <hi>Philosophy</hi> to
give an actuall subsistence and
being to first matter without
a forme. Hee that will allow
that a <hi>Reall</hi> existence in nature
is as superficially tincted in
<hi>Metaphysicks,</hi> as an other would
bee in Mathematicks that
should allow the like to a
point, a line, or a superficies
in Figures. These, in their
strict Notions, are but negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of further extension, or
but exact terminations of that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48918:13"/>
quantity which falleth under
the consideration of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;
in the present
purpose; no reall entities in
themselves: so likewise, the
notions of matter, forme, act,
power, existence, and the like,
that are with truth considered
by the understanding, and
have there each of them a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinet
entity, are never the
lesse, no where by themselves
in nature. They are termes
which wee must use in the
negotiations of our thoughts,
if wee will discourse conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
and conclude know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.
But then againe wee
must bee very wary of attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
to things in their owne
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48918:13"/>
natures, such entities as wee
create in our understandings,
when wee make pictures of
them there; for there every
different consideration ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
out of the different im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
which the same
thing maketh upon us, hath a
distinct being by it self. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
in thing, there is but one
single <hi>vnity,</hi> that sheweth (as
it were in a glasse, at severall
positions) those various faces
in our understanding. In a
word; all these words are but
artificiall termes, not reall
things: And the not right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
them, is the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerousest
rocke that <hi>Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi>
suffer ship wracke against.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:48918:14"/>I goe on with our <hi>Phisitians</hi>
contemplations. Vpon every
occasion, hee shewech strong
parts and a vigorous brayne.
His wishes and aymes, and
what he pointeth at, speake
him owner of a noble &amp; a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
heart. <hi>He</hi> hath reason
to wish that <hi>Aristotle</hi> had been
as accurate in examining the
causes, nature and affections of
the great Vniverse hee busied
himselfe about, as his <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arke
Galen</hi> hath beene in the
like considerations upon his
little <hi>World,</hi> mans body, in that
admirable worke of his <hi>de usu
partium.</hi> But no great humane
thing, was ever borne and
perfected at once. It may satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48918:14"/>
us, if one in our age, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
that magnifike structure
upon the others foundations;
and especially, if where hee fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
any of them unsound, he
eradicateth those, and fixeth
new unquestionable ones in
their roome: but so, as they
still, in grosse, keep a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and beare a <hi>Harmony</hi> with
the others great worke: This,
hath now, (even now) our
learned Country-man done,
The knowing Master <hi>White,</hi>
(whose name, I believe your
Lordship hath met withall) in
his excellent booke, <hi>De Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
newly printed at <hi>Paris,</hi>
where he now resideth, and is
admired by the world of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48918:15"/>
men there, as the <hi>Prodigie</hi>
of these latter times. Indeed
his three Dialogues upon that
Subject, (if I am able to judge
any thing) are full of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundest
learning I ever yet
met withall. And I beleeve;
who hath well read and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
them, will perswade
himselfe there is no truth so
abstruse, nor hitherto concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
out of our reach, but mans
wit may raise engines to scale
and conquer. I assure my selfe,
when our author hath studied
him throughly, hee will not
lament so loude for <hi>Aristotles</hi>
mutilated and defective <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy;</hi>
as in <hi>Boccalini, Caesar Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porali</hi>
doth for the losse of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:48918:15"/>
shipwracked <hi>Decads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Logicke</hi> which hee
quarrelleth at for calling a
<hi>Toade,</hi> or a <hi>Serpent</hi> ugly, will
in the end agree with his; for
no body ever tooke them to
be so, in respect of the <hi>Vntverse</hi>
(in which regard, he defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
their regularity, and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry)
but onely as they have
relation to us.</p>
            <p>But I cannot so easily agree
with him when he affirmeth
that <hi>Devills,</hi> or other Spirits in
the Intellectuall world have
no exact <hi>Ephemerides</hi> wherein
they may reade before-hand
the stories of fortuite acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents:
for I beleeve that all
causes are so immediately
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48918:16"/>
chayned to their effects, as if
a perfect knowing nature get
hold but of one linke, it will
drive the entire <hi>Series</hi> or pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of the whole to each ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
end; (as I thinke I have
proved in my forenamed trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfe)
so that in truth, there is
no fortuitnesse or contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of things, in respect of
themselves, but onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of us, that are ignorant
of their certaine, and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
causes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now</hi> a like <hi>Series</hi> or chaine,
and complexe of all outward
circumstances (whose highest
Linke, <hi>Poets</hi> say prettily, is fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Iupiters</hi> chayre, and the
lowest is riveted to every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48918:16"/>
on earth) steered and
levelled by <hi>God Almighty,</hi> at the
first setting out of the first Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
I conceive, to bee that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Providence</hi> and mercy,
which (to use our Authors
owne example) giveth a thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Genius</hi> to the <hi>Hollanders;</hi>
and the like: And not any se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
invisible, mysticall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
that falleth not under the
search or cognizance of a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
indagation.</p>
            <p>I must needs approve our
authors aequanimity, and I
may as justly say his magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
in being contented so
cheerfully (as he saith) to shake
hands with the fading <hi>Goods</hi> of
<hi>Fortune;</hi> and bee deprived of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48918:17"/>
the joyes of her most precious
blessings; so that hee may in
recompence, possesse in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
measure the true ones of
the mind, like <hi>Epictetus,</hi> that
great Master of morall wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and piety, who taxeth
them of high injustice that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
at Gods distribution of
his blessings, when he putteth
not into their share of goods,
such things as they use no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
or meanes to purchase.
For why should that man
who above all things estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
his owne freedome;
and who to enjoy that sequest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereth
himself from commerce
with the vulgar of mankinde;
take it ill of his <hi>Starres,</hi> if such
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48918:17"/>
preferments, honors, &amp; applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
meet not him, as are paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
gained after long &amp; tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
services of <hi>Princes,</hi> &amp; brittle
dependances of humorous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites,
&amp; supple complyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
with all sorts of natures?
As for what he faith of <hi>Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie;</hi>
I do not conceive that wise
men reject it so much for being
repugnant to Divinity (which
he reconcileth well enough) as
for having no solid rules, or
ground in nature. To rely too
far upon that vaine art, I judge
to bee rather folly then impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y.
Vnlesse in our censure, we
looke to the first <hi>Origine</hi> of it,
which savoureth of the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of those <hi>Heathens</hi> that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48918:18"/>
the <hi>Stars</hi> and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
bodies for <hi>Deities,</hi> did
in a superstitious devotion, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
unto them the causality
of all effects beneath them.
And for ought I know, the
beliefe of solid <hi>Orbes</hi> in the
heavens, and their regularly-irregular
motions, sprung
from the same root.) And a
like inanity, I should suspect
in <hi>Chiromancy</hi> as well as <hi>Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi>
(especially, in particular
contingent effects) however
our <hi>Author,</hi> and no lesse a man
then <hi>Aristotle,</hi> seeme to attribute
somewhat more to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturall art of <hi>Lynes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I should much doubt
(though our Author sheweth
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48918:18"/>
himselfe of another minde)
that <hi>Bernardinus Ochinus</hi> grew
at the last to bee a meere <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist:</hi>
               <note place="margin">This story I hav but upon rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet of a very good hand</note>
when after having beene
first the institutor and <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch</hi>
of the <hi>Capucine order</hi> (so
violent was his zeale then, as
no former religious instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
though never so rigorous,
was strict enough for him) hee
from thence fell to bee first an
<hi>Hereticke,</hi> then a <hi>Iew;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a while became a <hi>Turke,</hi>
and at the last wrote a furious
Invective against those whom
hee called the three <hi>Grand-Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors</hi>
of the <hi>World;</hi> among
whom hee ranked our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Christ,</hi> aswell as <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Mahomet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:48918:19"/>I doubt hee mistaketh in
his <hi>Chronologie,</hi> or the printer
in the name, when hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<hi>Ptolomy</hi> condemne the
<hi>Alchoran.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee needeth not be so seru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous,
as hee seemeth to bee
in averring downe rightly,
that God cannot doe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
things, (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
it is not amisle to
sweeten the manner of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
and the sound of the
words) for who understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the nature of contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
will find <hi>Non Entity</hi> in one
of the termes, which of <hi>God,</hi>
were impiety not to deny
peremptorily, for hee being
in his proper nature <hi>Selfe-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:48918:19"/>
all <hi>being</hi> must immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
flow from him, and all not-being
be totally excluded from
that effluxe. Now for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling
of <hi>Time</hi> past, which the
<hi>Angels</hi> posed <hi>Esdras</hi> withall;
there is no contradiction in
that; as is evident to them
that know the essence of time
(for it is but putting againe, all
things, that had motion, into
the same state they were in, at
that moment unto which
time was to be reduced backe
and from thence, letting it
travell on againe, by the same
motions, and upon the same
wheeles, it rolled upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.)
And therefore God
could doe this admirable
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48918:20"/>
worke, though neither <hi>Esdras,</hi>
nor all the power of creatures
together could doe it: And
consequently it cannot in this
Question bee said, that he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
mortality with what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
was not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</p>
            <p>I acknowledge ingenuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our <hi>Physicians</hi> experience
hath the advantage of my <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,</hi>
in knowing there are
witches. Yet I am sure, I have
no temptation to doubt of
the <hi>Deity;</hi> nor have any unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in believing there
are <hi>Spirits.</hi> I doe not see such
a necessary conjunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them, as that the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the one, must
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48918:20"/>
needs inferre the other. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I deny there are witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
I onely reserve my assent,
till I meete with stronger mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to carry it. And I confesse
I doubt asmuch of the efficacy
of those magicall rules he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of, as also of the finding
out of mysteries by the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Revelation of Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doubt, his discourse of an
vniversall <hi>Spirit,</hi> is but a wilde
fansie: And that in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalling
of it, hee mistaketh
the <hi>Hermeticall Philosophers.</hi> And
surely, it is a weake argument,
from a common nature that
subsisteth onely in our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
(out of which it
hath no being at all) to inferre,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48918:21"/>
by parity, an actuall subsistence
of the like, in realty of nature,
(of which kind of miscarriage
in mens discoursings, I have
spoken before) And upon this
occasion, I doe not see how
seasonably he falleth, of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
from naturall speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to a morall contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi> working in us.
In which also I would inquire
(especially upon his suddaine
poeticall rapture) whether the
solidity of the <hi>Iudgement</hi> bee
not outweighed by the ayrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the fancy. Assuredly
one cannot erre in taking this
<hi>Author</hi> for a very fine ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Gentleman:</hi> but for how
deepe a <hi>Scholler,</hi> I leave unto
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48918:21"/>
them to judge, that are abler
then I am.</p>
            <p>If he had applyed himselfe
with earnest study, and upon
right grounds, to search out
the nature of pure intellects: I
doubt not but his great parts
would have argued more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacionsly,
then he doth against
those that between men and
<hi>Angells</hi> put onely <hi>Porplyries</hi>
difference of <hi>Mortality</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.
And hee would
have dived further into the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of their intellectuall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;
in which there is no
succession; nor ratiocinative
discourse; for in the very first
instant of their creation, they
actually knew all that they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48918:22"/>
were capable of knowing; and
they are acquainted even with
all free thoughts, past, present,
and to come; for they see
them in their causes, and they
see them altogether at one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant:
as I have in my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
treatise proved at
<hi>large:</hi> and I thinke I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
touched thus much once
before in this <hi>Letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am tempted here to say
a great deale concerning <hi>Light,</hi>
by his taking it to bee a bare
quality. For in <hi>Physicks</hi> no
speculation is more usefull, or
reacheth further. But to set
downe such <hi>Phaenomena's</hi> of it
as I have observed, and from
whence I evidently collect the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48918:22"/>
nature of it; were too large
a <hi>Theame</hi> for this place; when
your Lordshippe pleaseth I
shall shew you another more
orderly discourse upon that
Subject; wherein I have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
proved it to be a solid
Substance and body.</p>
            <p>In his proceeding to collect
an intellectuall world; and
in his discoursing upon the
place, and habitation of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:</hi>
As also in his considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the activity of glorified
eyes; (which shal bein a state of
reft; whereas motion, is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to seeing) And in his subtil
speculation upon two bodies
placed in the vacuity beyond
the utmost all-enclosing su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48918:23"/>
of <hi>Heaven</hi> (which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth
a contradiction in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
me thinkes I heare <hi>Apelles</hi>
crying out, <hi>Ne sutor ultra Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidam:</hi>
or rather it putteth me
in minde of one of the titles in
<hi>Pantagruels</hi> Library, (which he
expresseth himselfe conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
in) namely, <hi>Quaestio Subti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lissima,
Vtrum Chimaera in vacuo
bombinans possit comedere Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das
intentiones.</hi> With which
short note I will leave there
considerations; in which (if
time and other circumstances
allowed it) matter would
spring up of excellent <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When our author shall have
read <hi>Master Whites</hi> Dialogues
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48918:23"/>
of the world, hee will no
longer bee of the opinion,
that the unity of the world is
a conclusion of Faith: For it
is there demonstrated by <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the thread of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
inviteth mee to fay a
great deale of the production,
or creation of Mans Soule.
But it is too tedious and too
knotty a peece for a <hi>Letter.</hi>
Now it shall suffice to note,
that it is not <hi>Ex traduce,</hi> and
yet hath a strange kind of
necre dependance of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
which is, as it were, Gods
instrument to create it by.
This, thus said, or rather rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
out, may seeme harth;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48918:24"/>
But had your Lordship leisure
to peruse what I have written
at full upon this point, I doubt
not but it would appeare
plausible enough to you.</p>
            <p>I cannot agree with him
when hee seemeth to impute
inconvenience to long life; &amp;
that length of time doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
impaire, then improve us:
For surely if wee will follow
the course of nature, and of
reason, it is a mighty great
blessing; were it but in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
that it giveth time leave
to vent &amp; boyle away the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnesses
and turbulencies
that follow our passions; and
to weane our selves gently
from carnall affections, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48918:24"/>
at the last to drop with ease
and willingnesse, like ripe fruit
from the <hi>Tree;</hi> as I remember
<hi>Plotinus</hi> finely discourseth in
one of his <hi>Enneads.</hi> For when
before the season, it is plucked
off with violent hands, or sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
downe by rude and boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous
windes, it carrieth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with it an indigested raw
tast of the wood, and hath an
unpleasant aigrenesse in its
juyce, that maketh it unfit for
use, till long time have mello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
it: And peradventure it
may be to backward, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of ripening, it may grow
rotten in the very <hi>Center.</hi> In
like manner, Soules that goe
out of their bodies with affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48918:25"/>
to those objects they
leave behinde them, (which
usually is as long as they can
relish them) doe retaine still
even in their separation, a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
and a languishing towards
them: which is the <hi>Reason</hi> why
such terrene Soules appeare
oftenest in Coemeteries and
Charnell houses; (and not,
that morall one which our
Author giveth:) for life which
is union with the body, being
that which carnal Soules have
straightesh affections to, and
that they are loathest to be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from; their unquiet
<hi>Spirit,</hi> which can never (natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally)
loose the impressions it
had wrought in it at the time
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48918:25"/>
of its driving out, lingreth
perpetually after that deare
confort of his. The impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
cannot cure them of their
impotent desires; They would
faine be alive againe,
<q>—Iterumque ad tarda reverti
Corpora. Quae lucis miseris tam di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
cupido?</q>
            </p>
            <p>And to this cause peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
may bee reduced the
strange effect which is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
seen in <hi>England,</hi> when
at the approach of the <hi>Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,</hi>
the slaine body suddaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bleedeth afreth: For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
the Soules of them that
are treacherously murdered
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48918:26"/>
by surprise, use to leave their
Bodies with extreame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingnesse,
and with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
indignation against them
that force them to so unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
&amp; abhorred a passage. That
Soule then to wreak its evill
tallent against the hated Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
and to draw a just and
desired revenge upon his
head; would doe all it can to
manifest the author of the fact.
To speake, it cannot; for in it
selfe, it wanteth <hi>Organs</hi> of
voyce, and those it is parted
from, are now growne too
heavy, and are too benummed
for it, to give motion unto.
Yet some change it desireth to
make in the body which it
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48918:26"/>
hath to vehement inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to, &amp; therfore is the aptest
for it to worke upon. It must
then endeavour to cause a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the subtilest &amp; most flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id
parts (and consequently, the
most moveable ones) of it.
This can be nothing but the
Blood; which then being vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently
moved, must needs
gush out at those places where
it findeth issues.</p>
            <p>Our author cannot beleeve
that the world will perish up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ruines of its own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:
But Master <hi>White</hi> hath
demonstrated the end of it
upon naturall Reason. And
though the precise time for
that generall destruction bee
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48918:27"/>
inscrutable; yet he learnedly
sheweth an ingenious rule
whereby to measure in some
fort the duration of it, without
being branded (as our author
threatneth) with convincible
and <hi>Statute</hi> madnesse, or with
impiety. And whereas hee
will have the worke of this
laft great day (the summer
up of all past dayes) to imply
annihilation and thereupon
interesseth God onely in it: I
must beg leave to contradict
him namely in this point, and
to affirme that the letting loose
then of the activest Element
to destroy this face of the
World, will but beget a change
in it, and that no annihilation
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48918:27"/>
can proceed from God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty:
for his essence being
(as I said before) selfe-existence,
it is more impossible that Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being
should flow from him,
then that cold should flow
immediately from fire, or
darkenesse from the actuall
presence of light.</p>
            <p>I must needs acknowledge
that where he ballanceth life
and death against one another
and considereth that the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is to bee a kind of nothing
for a moment, to become a
pure <hi>Spirit</hi> within one instant,
and what followeth of this
strong thought; is extreame
handsomely said, and argueth
very gallant and generous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48918:28"/>
in him.</p>
            <p>To exemplifie the immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Soule, hee needeth
not have recourse to the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers</hi>
stone. His owne store
furnisheth him with a most
pregnant one of reviving a
plant (the same numericall
plant) out of his owne ashes.
But under his favour, I beleeve
his experiment will faile, if
under the notion of the fame,
hee comprehendeth all the
Accidents that first accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
that plant; for since in
the ashes there remaineth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the fixed Salt, I am very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
that all the colour, and
much of the odor and Tast of
it, is flowne away with the
Volatile salt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:48918:28"/>What should I say of his
making so particular a narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of personall things, and
private thoughts of his owne;
the knowledge whereof can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
much conduce to any
mans betterment? (which I
make account is the chiefe end
of his writing this discourse)
As where he speaketh of the
soundnesse of his body, of the
course of his dyet, of the coole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his blood at the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Solstice of his age, of his
neglect of an <hi>Epitaph:</hi> how
long he hath lived or may live
what <hi>Popes, Emperours, Kings,
Grand-Seigniors,</hi> he hath beene
contemporary unto, and the
like: would it not be thought
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48918:29"/>
that hee hath a speciall good
opinion of himselfe, (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
hee hath reason) when
he maketh such great <hi>Princes</hi>
the Land-markes in the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology
of himselfe? Surely if
hee were to write by retaile
the particulars of his owne
Story and life, it would bee a
notable <hi>Romanze;</hi> since he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
us in one totall summe, it
is a continued miracle of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
yeares. Though he creepeth
gently upon us at the first, yet
he groweth a <hi>Gyant,</hi> an <hi>Attlas</hi>
(to use his owne expression)
at the last. But I will not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
him as hee that made
notes upon <hi>Balsacs</hi> letters,
and was angry with him for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48918:29"/>
vexing his readers with stories
of his <hi>Cholikes,</hi> and voyding of
gravell. I leave this kind of
his expressions, without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
further into them.</p>
            <p>In the next place (my <hi>Lord</hi>)
I shall take occasion from our
authors setting so maine a
difference betweene morall
honesty and vertue, or being
vertuous, (to use his owne
phrase) out of an inbred loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
to vertue; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, being vertuous for
a rewards sake; To discourse
a little concerning <hi>Vertue</hi> in
this life, and the effects of it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.
Truely (my Lord)
however he seemeth to prefer
this latter, I cannot but value
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48918:30"/>
the other much before it, if
we regard the noblenesse, and
heroikenesse of the nature and
mind from whence they both
proceed: And if wee consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Iourneyes end, to
which each of them carrieth us,
I am confident the first yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
nothing to the second, but
indeed both meete in the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od
of Beatitude. To cleare this
point (which is very well
worth the wisest mans seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousest
thoughts) we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
what it is that bringeth
us to this excellent State, to be
happy in the other world of
eternity and immutability. It
is agreed on all hands to bee
Gods grace and favour to us:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48918:30"/>
But all doe not agree by what
steps his grace produceth this
effect. Herein I shall not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
your Lordshippe with a
long discourse, how that grace
worketh in us, (which yet I
will in a word touch anon,
that you may conceive what
I understand grace to bee)
but will suppose it to have
wrought its effect in us in this
life, and from thence examine
what hinges they are that turn
us over to <hi>Beatitude</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi>
in the next. Some consider
God as a Iudge, that rewardeth
or punisheth men, according
as they cooperated with or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned
to, the grace hee gave.
That according as their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48918:31"/>
please or displease him, he
is well affected towards them
or angry with them; And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
maketh them, to
the purpose, and very home,
feele the effects of his kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or indignation. Others
that flye a higher pitch, and are
so happy,
<q>—Vt rerum poterint cognoscere
causas,</q>
doe conceive that Beatitude,
and misery in the other life,
are effects that necessarily
and orderly flow out of the
nature of those causes that be
got them in this life, without
engaging God Almighty to
give a sentence, and act the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48918:31"/>
part of a Iudge, according to
the state of our cause, as it shall
appeare upon the accusations
and pleadings at his great <hi>Bar.</hi>
Much of which manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
is metaphoricall, and
rather adapted to containe
vulgar mindes in their duties
(that are awed with the
thought of a severe Iudge, sift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every minute action of
theirs) then such as we must
conceive every circumstance
to passe so in reality as the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
sound of the words seemes
to inferre in ordinary constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
(and yet all that is true
too, in its genuine sense) But
(my <hi>Lord</hi>) these more penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
men, and that I conceive
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48918:32"/>
are vertuous upon higher and
stronger motives (for they
truely and solidly know why
they are so) doe consider that
what impressions are once
made in the spirituall substance
of a Soule, and what affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
it hath once contracted,
doe ever remaine in it till a
contrary and diametrally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
judgement and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
doe obliterate it, &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
it thence. This is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why <hi>Contrition,</hi> sorrow and
hatred for past <hi>Sins,</hi> is enchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
us. If then the <hi>Soule</hi> doe
goe out of the body with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
and affections to the
objects, and pleasures of this
life; it continually lingreth
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48918:32"/>
after them, and as <hi>Virgill</hi>
(learnedly as well as wittily)
saith,
<q>
                  <l>—Quae gratia currûm,
Armorumque fuit vivis, quae cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
nitentes</l>
                  <l>Pascere equos, eadem sequitur tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
repostos.</l>
               </q>
But that being a State wherin
those objects neither are, nor
can be enjoyed, it must needs
follow that such a Soule must
bee in an exceeding anguish,
sorrow, &amp; affliction, for being
deprived of them; &amp; for want
of those it so much priseth,
will neglect all other content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
it might have, as not
having a relish or tast moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48918:33"/>
and prepared to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
of them; but like fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verish
tongues, that when
they are even scorched with
heat, take no delight in the
pleasingest liquors, but the
sweetest drinks seeme bitter
to them by reason of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing
Gall; Soe they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
hate whatsoever Good is
in their power, and thus pine
away a long eternity. In which
the sharpenesse and activity
of their paine, anguish, and
sad condition, is to bee measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the sensiblenesse of
their natures: which being
then purely spirituall, is in
a manner infinitely more then
any torment that in this life
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48918:33"/>
can bee inflicted upon a dull
grosse body. To this add, the
vexation it must bee to them,
to see how inestimable and
infinite a good, they have lost;
and lost meerely by their own
fault; and for momentary tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles,
and childrens play; and
that it was so easie for them
to have gained it, had they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
but in their right sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and governed themselves
according to <hi>Reason.</hi> And
then judge in what a tortured
condition they must bee, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse
and execrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for their most resupine
and senselesse madnesse. But
if on the other side, a Soule be
released out of this <hi>Prison</hi> of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48918:34"/>
clay and flesh, with affections
setled upon intellectual goods
as <hi>Truth, Knowledge,</hi> and the
like; And that it be growne
to an irkesome dislike of the
flat pleasures of this world;
and looke upon carnall and
sensuall objects with a disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
eye, as discerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
inanity in them,
that is set off onely by their
painted outside; and above all,
that it have a longing desire
to bee in the society of that
supereminent cause of causes,
in which they know are
heaped up the <hi>Treasures</hi> of all
beauty, <hi>Knowledge, Truth, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi>
and good whatsoever;
and therefore are impatient at
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48918:34"/>
the <hi>Delay,</hi> and reckon all their
absence from him as a tedious
benithment; and in that regard
hate their life &amp; body as cause
of this divorce: such a Soule I
say must necessarily, by reason
of the Temper it is wrought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
enjoy immediately at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
of the bodies dissolution
and its liberty, more content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
more joy, more true
happinesse, then it is possible
for a heart of flesh to have
scarce any scantling of, much
lesse to comprehend.</p>
            <p>For immense knowledge
is naturall to it; as I have
touched before. <hi>Truth,</hi> which
is the adaequated and satisfying
object of the understanding,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48918:35"/>
is there displayed in her owne
Colours; or rather without
any.</p>
            <p>And that which is the <hi>Crown</hi>
of all, and in respect of which
all the rest is nothing; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
entity which above all
things this soule thirsteth to
bee united unto, can not for
his owne goodnesse sake deny
his embraces to so affectionate
a <hi>Creature,</hi> and to such an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
love. If he should;
then, were that Soule, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the best, and for loving
him most, condemned to be
the unhappiest. For what
joy could shee have in any
thing, were she barred from
what she so infinitely loveth?
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48918:35"/>
But since the nature of superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and excellent things is to
shower downe their propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
influences wheresoever
there is a capacity of receiving
them, and no obstacle to keep
them out (like the Sun that illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minateth
the whole ayre, if no
cloud or solid opacous body
intervene) it followeth cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that this infinite Sun of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
this immense Ocean of
goodnesse, cannot chuse but
environ with his beames, and
replenish even beyond satietie
with his delightsome waters,
a soule so prepared and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to receive them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now</hi> (my <hi>Lord</hi>) to make
use of this discourse and apply
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48918:36"/>
it to what begot it; be pleased
to determine which way will
deliver us evenest and smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
to this happie end of our
<hi>Iourney:</hi> To bee vertuous for
hope of a reward, and through
feare of punishment, or to be
so, out of a naturall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
affection to <hi>vertue,</hi> for
<hi>vertues</hi> and <hi>Reasons</hi> sake? sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one in this latter condition,
not onely doth those things
which will bring him to <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude;</hi>
but he is so secured in a
manner under an Armour of
<hi>Proofe,</hi> that hee is almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulnerable;
hee can scarce
miscarry, hee hath not so much
as an inclination to worke
contrarily, the alluring baites
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48918:36"/>
of this <hi>World,</hi> tempt him not;
hee disliketh, hee hateth, even
his necessary commerce with
them whiles hee liveth. On
the other side, the hireling
that steereth his course onely
by his reward and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
doth we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l I confesse;
but he doth it with reluctance;
hee carrieth the <hi>Arke,</hi> Gods I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
his Soule, safely home,
it is true, but hee loweth piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
after his calves that hee
leaveth behind him among
the <hi>Philistians.</hi> In a word he is
<hi>vertuous,</hi> but if hee might safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
hee would doe vitious
things. (And hence he the
ground in nature, if so I may
say, of our <hi>Purgatory</hi>) Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48918:37"/>
two such mindes may
not unfitly be compared to
two Maides, whereof one hath
a little sprinkling of the green
sicknesse, and hath more mind
to eate ashes, <hi>Chalke,</hi> or <hi>Leather,</hi>
then meates of solid and good
nourishment; but for beareth
them, knowing the languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
condition of <hi>Health</hi> it will
bring her to: But the other
having a ruddy, vigorous and
perfect constitution, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
a compleate entire eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crasie,
delights in no food but
of good nourriture, &amp; loathes
the others delights. <hi>Her</hi> health
is discovered in her lookes,
and shee is secure from any
danger of that Malady, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48918:37"/>
the other, for all her good
dyet, beareth in her complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
some sickly testimony of
her depraved appetite; and if
she bee not very <hi>Wary,</hi> shee is
in danger of a relapse.</p>
            <p>It falleth fit in this place to
examine our Authors appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of the end of such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<hi>Worthies</hi> and <hi>Philosophers</hi>
(as he calleth them) that dyed
before <hi>Christ</hi> his incarnation,
whether any of them could be
saved or no. Truely (my <hi>Lord</hi>)
I make no doubt at all, but if
any followed in the whole <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>
of their lives, the dictamens
of right <hi>Reason,</hi> but that their
Iourney was secure to <hi>Heaven.</hi>
Out of the former discourse
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48918:38"/>
appeareth what temper of
minde is necessary to get thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>And,</hi> that <hi>Reason</hi> would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
such a temper to aperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
judicious man (though but
in the state of <hi>Nature</hi>) the
best and most rationall for
him, I make no doubt at all.
But it is most true; they are
exceeding few, (if any) in
whom <hi>Reason</hi> worketh clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and is not overswayed by
<hi>Passion</hi> and terrene affections;
they are few that can discerne
what is reasonable to be done
in every circumstance.
<q>
                  <l>—Pauci, quos aequus amavit
Iupiter, aut ardens evexit ad aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
virtus;</l>
                  <l>Dis geniti, potuere;—</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:48918:38"/>
And fewer, that knowing
what is best, can win of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to doe accordingly; (<hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo
meliora proboque, deteriora se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor;</hi>
being most mens cases)
so that after all that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
at the hands of nature
and reason in their best habit,
since the lapse of them, wee
may conclude, it would have
beene a most difficult thing
for any man, and a most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
one for mankinde, to
attaine unto <hi>Beatitude,</hi> if <hi>Christ</hi>
had not come to teach, and by
his example to shew us the
way.</p>
            <p>And this was the <hi>Reason</hi> of
his incarnatiod, teaching life &amp;
death: for being God, wee
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48918:39"/>
could not doubt his veracity,
when he told us newes of the
other world; having all things
in his power, and yet enjoying
none of the delights of this
life, no man should sticke at
foregoing them, since his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
sheweth all men that
such a course is best; whereas
few are capable of the <hi>Reason</hi>
of it: And for his last act, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in such an afflicted man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
hee taught us how the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curest
way to step immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into perfect happinesse, is to
be crucified to all the desires,
delights, and contentments of
this <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to come backe to our
<hi>Physician:</hi> Truely (my <hi>Lord</hi>) I
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48918:39"/>
must needs pay him as a due
the acknowledging his pious
discourses to bee excellent and
patheticall ones, containing
worthy motives, to encite one
to vertue and to deterre one
from vice: thereby to gaine
<hi>Heaven,</hi> and to avoid <hi>Hell.</hi> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly
he is owner of a solid
head and of a strong generous
heart. Where hee imployeth
his thoughts upon such things
as thoughts upon such things
as resoit to no higher, or more
abstruse <hi>Principles</hi> then such as
occurre in ordinary conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with the world, or in the
common tracke of study and
learning, I know no man
would say better. But when
hee meeteth with such diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48918:40"/>
as his next concerning
the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the body,
(wherein after deepe medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
upon the most abstracted
principles, and speculations of
the <hi>Metaphysikes,</hi> one hath
much adoe to solve the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
contradictions in <hi>Nature)
There,</hi> I doe not at all wonder
hee should tread a little awry,
and goe astray in the darke;
for I conceive his course of life
hath not permitted him to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
much time unto the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winding
of such entangled
and abstracted subtilties. But
if it had, I beleeve his naturall
parts are such as he might have
kept the chaire from most men
I know: for even where hee
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48918:40"/>
roveth widest, it is with so
much wit and sharpenesse, as
putteth me in mind of a great
mans censure upon <hi>Ioseph Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligers
Cyclometrica</hi> (a matter he
was not well versed in) that
hee had rather erre so ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
as he did, then hit upon
<hi>Truth</hi> in that heavy manner as
the <hi>Iesuite,</hi> his antagonist stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth
his <hi>Bookes.</hi> Most assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his wit and smartnesse in
this discourse is of the finest
<hi>Standard;</hi> and his insight into
severer <hi>Learning</hi> will appeare
as piercing unto such as use
not strictly the touchstone and
the <hi>Test</hi> to examine everypeece
of the glittering coine hee
payeth his reader with. But to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48918:41"/>
come to the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes
it is but a grosse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
to thinke that every
<hi>Atome</hi> of the present individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
matter of a body; every
graine of <hi>Ashes</hi> of a burned
<hi>Cadaver,</hi> scattered by the wind
throughout the world, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
numerous variations chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
peradventure into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of another man; should
at the sounding of the last
<hi>Trumpet</hi> be raked together
againe from all the corners of
the earth, and be made up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
into the same <hi>Body</hi> it was
before of the first man. Yet if
we will be <hi>Christians,</hi> and rely
upon Gods promises, wee
must beleeve that we shall rise
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48918:41"/>
againe with the same Body,
that walked about, did eate,
drinke, aud live here on earth;
and that we shall see our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
and <hi>Redeemer</hi> with the
same, the very same, eyes,
wherewith we now look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the fading <hi>Glories</hi> of this
contemptible world.</p>
            <p>How shall these seeming
contrarieties bee reconciled?
if the latter be true why should
not the former be admitted?
To explicate this riddle the
better, give me leave to aske
your Lordship if you now see
the <hi>Cannons,</hi> the <hi>Ensignes,</hi> the
<hi>Armes</hi> and other martiall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
at <hi>Oxford,</hi> with the
same eyes, wherewith many
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48918:42"/>
yeares agone you looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Porphyries</hi> and <hi>Aristotles</hi>
glearned leases there? I doubt
not but you will answer mee,
Assuredly with the very same.
Is that noble and <hi>Gracefull</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of yours, that begetteth
both delight and <hi>Reverence</hi> in
every one that looketh upon
it? Is that body of yours, that
now is growne to such come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and full dimensions, as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
can give her none more
advantagious, the same person,
the same body, which your
vertuous and excellent Mother
bore nine moneths in her chast
and honoured wombe, and
that your Nurse gave sucke un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to?
most certainely it is the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48918:42"/>
same. And yet if you consider
it well, it cannot bee doubted
but that sublunary matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a perpetuall flux, and in
bodies which have internall
principles of <hi>Heate</hi> and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
much continually transpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
out to make roome for
the supply of new aliment; at
the length, in long processe of
time, all is so changed, As that
<hi>Ship</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> may as well bee
called the same ship that was
there two hundred yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and whereof (by reason
of the continuall reparations)
not one foote of the <hi>Tymber</hi>
is remaining in her that buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her at the first; As this
<hi>Body</hi> now, can be called the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48918:43"/>
same it was, forty yeares agone
unlesse some higher considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
keepe up the <hi>Identity</hi> of
it. Now what that is, Let
us examine, and whether or
no, it will reach to our diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> Let us
consider then how that which
giveth the numerical individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
to a <hi>Body,</hi> is the substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
forme. As long as that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
the same, though the
matter be in a continuall fluxe
and motion, yet the thing is
still the same. <hi>There</hi> is not one
droppe of the same water in
the <hi>Thames</hi> that ranne downe
by <hi>Whitehall</hi> yesternight, yet
no man will deny, but that it
is the same River that was in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48918:43"/>
Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, as
long as it is supplied from the
same Common Stocke, the
<hi>Sea.</hi> Though this example
reacheth not hom, it illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the thing. If then the
forme remaine absolutely the
same after separation from
the matter, that it was in the
matter, (which can happen
onely to formes, that subsist
by themselves; as humane
<hi>Soules</hi>) it followeth then, that
whensoever it is united to
matter againe, (all matter
comming out of the same
common Magazine) it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
againe the same man,
with the same eyes, and all
the same limbes that were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48918:44"/>
Nay, hee is composed
of the same Individuall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
for it hath the same di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisher
and individuator;
to wit, the same forme, or
<hi>Soule.</hi> Matter considered sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by it selfe, hath no distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
All matter is in it selfe
the same; we must fansie it,
as we doe the indigested <hi>Chaos;</hi>
It is an uniformely wild <hi>Ocean.</hi>
Particularize a few drops of
the <hi>Sea,</hi> by filling a glasse full
of them; then that glasse full
is distinguished from all the
rest of the watery <hi>Bulke:</hi> But
returne backe those few drops
to from whence they were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and the Glasse-full that
even now had an individua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48918:44"/>
by it selfe, loseth that,
and groweth one and the
same with the other maine
stocke: Yet if you fill your
glasse againe, whersoever you
take it up, so it be of the same
uniforme <hi>Bulke</hi> of water you
had before, it is the same
Glasse-full of water that you
had. But as I said before,
this example fitteth entirely,
no more then the other did.
In such abstracted speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
where we must consider
matter without forme (which
hath no actuall being) wee
must not expect adaequated
examples in nature. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
is said to make a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
man see, that if <hi>God</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:48918:45"/>
should joyne the <hi>Soule</hi> of a
lately dead man (even whiles
his dead corps should lie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
in his winding sheete
here) unto a <hi>Body</hi> made of
earth taken from fome moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
in <hi>America;</hi> it were
most true and certaine that
the body he should then live
by, were the same. Identicall
body he lived with before his
<hi>Death</hi> and late <hi>Resurrection.</hi> It is
evident that <hi>samenesse, thisnesse,</hi>
and <hi>thatnesse,</hi> belongeth not
to matter by it selfe, (For a
generall indifference runneth
through it all) but onely as
it is distinguished and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duated
by the Forme. Which,
in our case, whensoever the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48918:45"/>
same <hi>Soule</hi> doth, it must be
understood alwayes to be the
same matter and body.</p>
            <p>This point thus passed over;
I may piece to it what our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>
saith of a <hi>Magazine</hi> of Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent
formes residing first in
the <hi>Chaos,</hi> &amp; hereafter (when
the world shall have beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
by fire) in the generall
heape of <hi>Ashes;</hi> out of which
Gods voyce did, &amp; shall, draw
them out &amp; cloath them with
matter. This language were
handsome for a <hi>Poet</hi> or a <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torician</hi>
to speake. But in a <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,</hi>
that should ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
strictly and rigorously, I
can not admit it, for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there are no subsistent forms
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48918:46"/>
of <hi>Corporeall</hi> things: (excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Soule of man, which
besides being an informing
forme, hath another particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
consideration belonging
to it; too long to speake of
here) But whensoever that
compound is destroyed, the
forme perisheth with the
whole. And for the naturall
production of <hi>Corporeall</hi> things
I conceive it to be wrought out
by the action and passion of
the <hi>Elements</hi> among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
which introducing
new tempers and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
into the bodies where
these conflicts passe; new
formes succeed old ones,
when the dispositions are
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48918:46"/>
raised to such a height as
can no longer consist with
the preceding forme, and
are in the immediate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to fit the succeeding one,
which they usher in. The
mystery of all which I have at
large unfolded in my above
mentioned treatise, of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of the <hi>Soule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall say no more to the
first part of our <hi>Phisicians</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
after I have observed
how his consequence is no
good one, where hee infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that if the <hi>Devills</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew,
who would bee dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
or saved, it would save
them the <hi>Labor,</hi> and end their
worke of tempting mankinde
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48918:47"/>
to mischiefe and evill. For
whatsoever their morall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
and successe bee in it,
their nature impelleth them
to be alwaies doing it. For on
the one side, it is active in the
highest degree (as being pure
<hi>Acts,</hi> that is <hi>Spirits,</hi>) so on the
other side, they are maligne
in as great an excesse: By the
one they must be alwayes
working wheresoever they
may worke; (like water in a
vessell full of holes, that will
run out of every one of them
which is not stopped) By the
other, their whole worke
must be malicious and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous.
Ioyning then both
these qualities together, it is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48918:47"/>
evident they will alwayes bee
tempting mankind, though
they know they shall be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
of their morall end.</p>
            <p>But were it not time that
I made an end? Yes, it is more
then time. And therefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
once passed the limit that
confined what was becoming,
the next step carryed mee into
the <hi>Ocean</hi> of <hi>Error;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
infinite, and therefore
more or lesse bearing no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
in it; I will proceed
a little further, to take a short
survey of his <hi>Second</hi> part; And
hope for as easie <hi>Pardon</hi> after
this addition to my suddaine
and indigested remarkes, as if
I had closed them up now.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:48918:48"/>
               <hi>Methinkes,</hi> he beginneth
with somewhat an affected
discourse to prove his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
inclination to <hi>Charity</hi>
which <hi>vertue</hi> is the intended
<hi>Theame</hi> of all the remainder of
his discourse. And I doubt he
mistaketh the lowest <hi>Orbe</hi> or
<hi>Lembe</hi> of that high <hi>Seraphicke</hi>
vertue, for the top and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of it; and maketh a kind
of humane compassion to bee
divine <hi>Charity.</hi> Hee will have
it to bee a generall way of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good: It is true, he addeth
then, for Gods sake; But hee
allayeth that againe, with say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hee will have that good
done as by obedience, and to
accomplish Gods will; and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48918:48"/>
looketh at the effects it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
upon our Soules but in a
narrow compasse; like one in
the vulgar throng, that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
God as a Iudge, &amp; as a
rewarder or a punisher. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
perfect <hi>Charity,</hi> is that vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
love of God for his own
sake, for his goodnesse, for his
beauty, for his excellency that
carrieth all the motions of our
Soule directly and violently to
him; and maketh a man dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
or rather hate all obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
that may retard his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to him. And that face of it
that looketh toward mankind
with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we live, &amp; warmeth
us to doe others good, is but
like the overflowings of the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48918:49"/>
maine streame, that swelling:
above its bankes runneth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in a multitude of little
Channels.</p>
            <p>I am not satisfyed, that in
the likenesse which he putteth
betweene <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> hee
maketh the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them, to bee but such
as betweene two creatures
that resemble one another. For
betweene these, there is some
proportions; but between the
others, none at all. In the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
of which discourse,
wherein the <hi>Author</hi> observeth
that no two faces are ever seen
to be perfectly alike; Nay no
two <hi>Pictures</hi> of the same face,
were ever exactly made so; I
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48918:49"/>
could take occasion to insert a
subtile &amp; delightfull demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of Mr. <hi>Whites,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he sheweth how it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that two bodyes (for
example, two <hi>Boules</hi>) should
ever be made exactly like one
another; Nay, not rigorously
equall in any one accident, as
namely in weight, but that still
there will be some little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and inequality between
them, (the <hi>Reason</hi> of which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
our <hi>Author</hi> medleth
not with) were it not that I
have beene so long already, as
digressions were now very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable.</p>
            <p>Shall I commend or censure
our <hi>Author</hi> for beleeving so
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48918:50"/>
well of his acquired knowledg
as to be dejected at the
thought of not being able to
leave it a Legacy among his
friends? Or shall I examine
whether it be not a high inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to wife and gallant <hi>Princes,</hi>
who out of the generousnesse
and noblenesse of their <hi>Nature</hi>
doe patronize arts and learned
men, to impute their so doing
to vanity of desiring praise, or
to feare of reproach?</p>
            <p>But let these passe: I will
not ingage any that may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend
him, in a quarrell against
him. But I may safely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<hi>Epictetus</hi> to contradict
him when he letteth his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
engulfe him in deepe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48918:50"/>
for a friend: For hee
will not allow his wise man
to have an inward relenting,
a troubled feeling, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
of anothers misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
That disordereth the
one, without any good to
the other. Let him afford all
the assistances and relievings
in his power; but without
intermingling himselfe in the
others <hi>Woe.</hi> As <hi>Angels</hi> that doe
us good, but have no passion
for us. But this Gentlemans
kindnesse goeth yet further:
Hee compareth his love of a
friend to his love of <hi>God;</hi> the
union of friends Soules by
affection, to the union of
three persons in the <hi>Trinity;</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:48918:51"/>
and to the <hi>Hypostaticall</hi> union
of two natures in one <hi>Christ,</hi>
by the Words <hi>Incarnation.</hi> Most
certainely hee expresseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to bee a right good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd
man: But if Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
retracted so severely his
patheticall expressions for the
death of his friend, saying they
favoured more of the <hi>Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
declamations of a young
<hi>Orator,</hi> then of the grave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of a devout <hi>Christian,</hi>
(or somewhat to that purpose)
what censure upon himselfe
may wee expect of our <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi>
if ever hee make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation
of this discourse
concerning his <hi>Religion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is no small misfortune to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48918:51"/>
him, that after so much time
spent, and so many places vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited
in curious search by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
after the acquisition
of so many languages; after
the wading so deepe in Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as appeareth by the ample
Inventory and particular hee
maketh of himselfe: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of all this, should bee to
professe ingenuously he had
studyed enough, onely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a <hi>Scepticke:</hi> and that
having runne through all
sorts of <hi>Learning,</hi> hee could
finde rest and satisfaction in
none. This I confesse is the
unlucky fate of those that
light upon wrong <hi>Principles.</hi>
But Master <hi>White</hi> teacheth us
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48918:52"/>
how the <hi>Theorems</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of <hi>Physickes,</hi> may
be linked &amp; chained together
as strongly &amp; as continuedly as
they are in the <hi>Mathematickes,</hi> if
men would but apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to a right method of
Study. And I doe not finde that
<hi>Salomon</hi> complained of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in the height of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
(as this <hi>Gentleman</hi> saith)
but onely, that after he hath
rather acknowledged himselfe
ignorant of nothing, but that
hee understood the natures of
all <hi>Plants</hi> from the <hi>Cedar</hi> to the
<hi>Hyssop,</hi> and was acquainted
with all the wayes, and pathes
of wisedome and knowledg;
hee exclaimeth that all this is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48918:52"/>
but <hi>Toyle,</hi> and vexation of <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi>
and therefore adviseth
men to change humane Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
into divine contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and affections.</p>
            <p>I cannot agree to his Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of shutting his <hi>Bookes,</hi>
and giving over the search of
knowledge, and resigning
himselfe up to ignorance, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Reason</hi> that moveth
him; as though it were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
<hi>vanity</hi> to wait our
dayes in the pursuite of that,
which by attending but a little
longer (till Death hath closed
the eyes of our body, to open
those of our <hi>Soule</hi>) wee shall
gain with ease, wee shall enjoy
by infusion, and is an accessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48918:53"/>
of our Glorification. It is
true, assoone as <hi>Death</hi> hath
played the Midwife to our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
birth, our Soule shall
then see all truths, more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then our corporal eyes at
our first birth see all bodies
and colours, by the naturall
power of it (as I have touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
already) and not onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the grounds our <hi>Author</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.
Yet farre be it from us
to thinke that time lost which
in the meane season we shall
laboriously imploy to warme
our selves with blowing a few
little <hi>Sparkes</hi> of that glorious
fire which we shall afterwards
in one instant leape into the
middle of, without danger of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48918:53"/>
Scorching. And that for
two important <hi>Reasons;</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
severall others, too long
to mention here) the one, for
the great advantage wee have
by learning in this life; the
other, for the huge content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that the acquisition of it
here (which implyeth a strong
affection to it) will be unto
us in the next life. The want
of knowledge in our first Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(which exposed her to
bee easily deceived by the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents</hi>
cunning) was the roote
of all our ensuing <hi>Misery</hi> and
<hi>Woe.</hi> It is as true (which wee
are taught by irrefragable au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority)
that <hi>Omnis peccans ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norat:</hi>
And the well head of all
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48918:54"/>
the Calamties and mischiefes
in the world, eonsisteth of the
trouble and bitter waters of
ignorance, folly and rashnesse;
to cure which, the onely reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and antidote, is the salt of
true <hi>Learning,</hi> the bitter <hi>Wood</hi>
of <hi>Study,</hi> painefull meditation,
and orderly confideration. I
doe not meane such <hi>Study,</hi> as
armeth wrangling <hi>Champions</hi>
for clamorous <hi>Schooles,</hi> where
the ability of Subtile disputing
to and fro, is more prised
then the retriving of truth;
But such as filleth the mind
with solid and usefull notions,
and doth not endanger the
swelling it up with windy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.
Besides the sweetest
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48918:54"/>
companion and entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a well tempered mind
is to converse familiarly with
the naked and bewitching
beauties of those Mistresses,
those Verities, and Sciences,
which by faire courting of
them, they gaine and enjoy;
&amp; every day bring new fresh
ones to their <hi>Seraglio;</hi> where
the ancientest never grow old
or stale. Is there any thing so
pleasing or so profitable as
this?</p>

            <p>But now if we consider the
advantage we shall have in the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48918:55"/>
other life by our affection to
<hi>Sciences,</hi> and conversation
with them in this, it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
great. Indeed that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
is so necessary, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it we shall enjoy little
contentment in all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
we shall then bee reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with: for every ones
pleasure in the possession of a
good, is to be measured by
his precedent <hi>Desire</hi> of that
good; and by the quality of
the tast and relish of him that
feedeth upon it. Wee should
therefore prepare and make
our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ast before-hand by assue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
unto, and by often
relishing, what we shall
then be nourished with. That
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48918:55"/>
               <hi>Englishman</hi> that can drinke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>Beere,</hi> or <hi>Ale,</hi> would
be ill bestead, were he to goe
into <hi>Spaine or Italy</hi> where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>Wine</hi> groweth:
whereas a well experienced
<hi>Goinfre</hi> that can criticise upon
the severall tasts of liquors,
would thinke his <hi>Palate</hi> in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise</hi>
among those delicious
<hi>Nectars,</hi> (to use <hi>Aretines phrase</hi>
upon his eating of a <hi>Lamprey.</hi>)
Who was ever delighted with
<hi>Tobacco</hi> the first time he tooke
it? &amp; who could willingly be
without it, after hee was a
while habituated to the use of
it? How many examples are
there dayly of young men, that
marrying upon their fathers
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48918:56"/>
command, not through pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
affections of their own,
have little comfort in worthy
and handsome wives, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
would passionately ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?
<hi>Archímedes</hi> lost his life
for being so ravished with the
delight of a Mathematicall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration,
that he could
not of a suddaine recall his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasied
<hi>Spirits</hi> to attend the rude
Souldiers Summons: But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of him, whose minde
had beene alwayes sed with
such subtile <hi>Dyet,</hi> how many
playne <hi>Country</hi> Gentlemen
doth your Lordship and I
know, that rate the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of their husbandry at a
much higher pitch; and are
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48918:56"/>
extreamely delighted by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
with that; whereas
the other would be most tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and importune to them?
We may then safely conclude,
that if we will joy in the
<hi>Knowledge</hi> wee shall have after
<hi>Death,</hi> we must in our life
time raise within our selves,
earnest affections to it, and
desires of it: which cannot
be barren ones; but will presse
upon us to gaine some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
by way of advance here;
and the more we attaine unto
the more we shall be in <hi>Lovè</hi>
with what remaineth behind.
To this reason then adding
the other, how knowledge is
the surest proppe, and guide
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48918:57"/>
of our present life: and how
it perfecteth a man in that
which constituteth him a
man; his <hi>Reason;</hi> and how
it enableth him to read bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
steadily, constantly, and
knowingly in all his wayes:
And I am confident, All men
that shall heare the case thus
debated, will joyne with mee
in making it a Suit to our
<hi>Physitian,</hi> that hee will keepe
his <hi>Bookes</hi> open, and continue
that <hi>Progresse</hi> he hath so happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begun.</p>
            <p>But I believe your Lordship
will scarcely joyne with him
in his with that wee might
procreate and beget Children
without the helpe of women
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48918:57"/>
or without any conjunction or
commerce with that sweete,
and bewitching <hi>Sex. Plato</hi>
taxed his fellow <hi>Philosopher,</hi>
(though other wise a learned
and brave man) for not sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
to the <hi>Graces;</hi> those
gentle female goddesses. What
thinketh your Lordship of
our <hi>Physitians</hi> bitter censure of
that action which <hi>Mahomet</hi>
maketh the essence of his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise?</hi>
Indeed besides those
his unkindnesses, or rather
frowardnesses, at that tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
Sex (which must
needes take it ill at his hands)
me thinketh he setreth marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
at too low a rate, which
is assuredly the highest and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinest
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48918:58"/>
linke of humane socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And where he speaketh
of <hi>Cupid,</hi> and of <hi>Beauty,</hi> it is in
such a phrase, as putteth mee
in mind of the Learned <hi>Greeke
Reader</hi> in <hi>Cambridge</hi> his court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his <hi>Mistris</hi> out of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi>
his <hi>Thesaurus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My next observation upon
his discourse draweth me to a
<hi>Logicall</hi> consideration of the
nature of an exact <hi>Syllogisine:</hi>
which kind of reflection,
though it use to open the
doore in the course of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and study; yet it will
necre shut it in my discourse;
which my following the thred
that my <hi>Author</hi> spinneth, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signeth
to this place. If he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48918:58"/>
had well and throughly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
all that is required to
that strict way of managing
our <hi>Reason,</hi> he would not have
censured <hi>Aristotle</hi> for condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the fourth figure, out of
no other motive, but because
it was not consonant to his
owne principles; that it
would not fit with the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
himself had laid; though
it doe with reason, (saith he)
and bee consonant to that;
which indeed it doth not, at
all times and in all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
In a perfect <hi>Syllogisme</hi>
the predicate must bee identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the subject, and each
extreame with the middle
terme, and so consequently, all
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48918:59"/>
three with one another. But
in <hi>Galens</hi> fourth figure the
case may so fall out, as these
rules will not be current
there.</p>
            <p>As for the good and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
that he considereth in
the worst things; and how
farre from solitude, any man
is in a wildernesse; <hi>These</hi> are
(in his discourse) but <hi>aequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
considerations of <hi>Good,</hi> and
of <hi>Lonclinesse:</hi> nor are they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wayes pertinent to the
morality of that part where
he treateth of them.</p>
            <p>I have much adoe to believe
what he speaketh confidently:
that hee is more beholding to
<hi>Morpheus</hi> for Learned and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48918:59"/>
as well as pleasing
<hi>Dreames;</hi> then to <hi>Mercury</hi> for
smart and facetious concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
whom <hi>Saturne</hi> (it seemeth
by his relation) hath looked
asquint upon in his geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>In his concluding <hi>Prayer,</hi>
wherein he summeth up all
he wisheth; me thinketh his
arrow is not winged with
that fire which I should have
expected from him upon this
occasion; for it is not the
peace of <hi>Conscience,</hi> nor the
bridling up of ones affections,
that expresseth the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfulnes
and happiest state
of a perfect <hi>Christian.</hi> It is love
onely that can give us <hi>Heaven</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:48918:60"/>
upon earth, as well as in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi>
and bringeth us thither
too: so that the <hi>Thuscan Virgill</hi>
had reason to say,
<q>
                  <l>—In alte dolcezze</l>
                  <l>Non si puo gioir, se non amando.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And this love must be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
upon the noblest and
highest object; not termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in our friends. But of this
transcendent and divine part
of <hi>Charity</hi> that looketh direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and immediately upon God
himselfe; and that is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecall
forme, the utmost
perfection, the scope and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
period of true <hi>Religion,</hi>
(this Gentlemans intended
<hi>Theame;</hi> as I conceive) I have
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48918:60"/>
no occasion to speak any
thing, since my <hi>Author</hi> doth
but transiently mention it;
and that too, in such a phrase
as ordinary <hi>Catechismes</hi> speake
of it to vulgar capacities.</p>
            <p>Thus (my <hi>Lord</hi>) having
run through the booke (God
knowes how sleightly, upon
so great a suddaine) which
your Lordship commanded
mee to give you an account of,
there remaineth yet a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
taske upon me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme;
which is to excuse my
selfe of presumption for da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to consider any moles in
that face which you had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for a beauty. But who
shall well consider my man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48918:61"/>
of proceeding in these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markes,
will free me from
that censure. I offer not at
<hi>Iudging</hi> the prudence and
wisedome of this discourse:
Those are fit enquiries for
your Lordships Court of
highest appeale; in my inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
one, I meddle onely with
little knotty peeces of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
Sciences; (<hi>Matinae apis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>star,
operosa parvus carmina fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi>)
In which it were perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
a fault for your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to be too well versed;
your imployments are of a
higher and nobler <hi>Straine;</hi> and
that concerne the welfare of
millions of men:

            <p>Such little Studies as these,
belong onely to those persons
that are low in the ranke they
hold in the Commonwealth,
low in their conceptions, and
low in a languishing and
iusting leisure, such a one as
<hi>Virgill</hi> calleth <hi>Ignobile otium,</hi> and
such a one as I am now dulled
withall. If <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Caesar</hi>
should have commended a
tract of Land, as fit to fight a
Battaile in for the Empire of
the World, or to build a City
upon, to be the <hi>Magazine</hi> and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48918:62"/>
staple of all the adjacent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
No body could justly
condemne that husbandman,
who according to his owne
narrow art and rules, should
censure the plaines of <hi>Arbela,</hi>
or <hi>Pharsalia</hi> for being in some
places sterile; or the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
about <hi>Alexandria,</hi> for
being sometimes subject to
bee overflowen; or could
taxe ought he should say in
that kinde for a contadiction
unto the others commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of those places; which
are built upon higher, and
larger principles. So (my
<hi>Lord</hi>) I am confident I shall
not be reproached of unman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerlinesse
for putting in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48918:62"/>
unto a few little par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities
in that Noble dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
which your Lordship
gave a generall applause unto;
And by doing so, I have given

him to much thoughtfulnesse: In this
temper, hee meeseth with a <hi>Booke,</hi> or a
