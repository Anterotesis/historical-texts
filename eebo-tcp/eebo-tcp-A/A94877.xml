         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A True Account of the BEHAVIOUR
OF
Mr. Francis Newland,
Who was Executed at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> on <hi>Friday</hi> the 19th of
<hi>April,</hi> 1695. for the Murther of <hi>Francis Thomas,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">Together with a Paper delivered to the Ordinary, atteſted with
his own Hand, deſiring that he would publiſh it, for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of his Friends and Acquaintance.</head>
            <p>MR. <hi>Newland</hi> was conveyed to <hi>Tyburn</hi> in a Coach, out of which he aſcended into
a Cart; many ſpectators being preſent, he ſpake nothing to them. His whole
deportment was very humble and ſerious, as became him in the near approach
of his Death. I exhorted him to beg of God ſtrength of Faith, a ſubmiſſive Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of himſelf to the mercy of a gracious Redemer. He replied, that he had no other
refuge to comfort him in this his diſtreſs. After ſeveral Prayers, he deſired the 32d Pſalm
might be ſung; accordingly it was. At my departure out of the Cart, he gave me a paper,
written with his own hand and ſubſcribed <hi>Francis Newland,</hi> in which is very pathetical
good Counſel to his Friends, and all other young Perſons: He deſired me to publiſh it in
print, it began thus.</p>
            <p>Tho I am come hither, publickly to dye, for a barbarous Murrher, I declare (as I
hope for mercy from God) that I had not my hand in this murther. Indeed I was an Eye
witneſs, but knew nothing of the quarrel, nor was any way concerned in it. Neither was any
other perſons, except <hi>James Philboy,</hi> and <hi>Daniel Tully.</hi> Notwithſtanding there were ſeveral
ſwords drawn in the Street, no one injured the deceaſed, that I ſaw; but on the contrary
ſeveral would have parted them had they not been prevented by <hi>Tully,</hi> which was my only
reaſon of drawing my ſword.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding I publickly ſuffer death, no one wiſhes better ſucceſs to my Country.
I heartily forgive all who have injured me, as I hope all do me, whom I have injured.
I wiſh all People, and eſpecially my Friends and Acquaintance, that my unfortunate End,
may be a ſufficient means to prevent them from any thing, which may in the leaſt cauſe
them to depend on others mercies.</p>
            <p>It is not for me now to inſiſt upon this, ſince I am at peace with all the World. I ſhall
ſay ſomething to detain all people from idle quarrelſome company, which undoubtedly is
the inlet to all other miſchief, and misfortune, as by me plainly appears. I ſuffer (I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
believe) a moſt juſt reward, for my paſt ſinful life and converſation. I not long ſince
thought my ſelf as far from this untimely end, as any of my acquaintance; and therefore
I hope, that ſince in this caſe I am able to ſay but very little, that the very Example it ſelf
may deter them, from their ſinful wicked courſes of living; which undoubtedly will be
as ſeverely puniſht, if not in this World, in the next, they may ſhortly expect it, which
will be far worſe, unleſs they unfeignedly repent, which can never be too ſoon, tho it
may be too late; for aſſure your ſelves nothing can be half ſo great a Terror to a man?,
that when leaving this World, to find himſelf altogether unfit for another, and examining
himſelf finds, that he groans under an immenſe burthen of ſin, which he can no way get
rid of. The ill conſequence of which, I am not able to deſcribe, but muſt leave them
further to conſider of it.</p>
            <p>Tho I beſs God, that ſince my diſmal ſentance, I have ſo much reflected on my paſt
life, together with the good advice I had of ſeveral people, that that which I thought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
moſt dear and pleaſant to me, is now ſo odious and unpleaſant; that were I now at
my liberty and accidentally ſhould meet with any of my former acquaintance, I ſhould
certainly thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> them all Drunk, were they never ſo Sober. And I ſuppoſe, they, on the contrary,
would think me mad. Yet I am ſo well pleaſed and ſatisfied with this my misfortune, that
rather than I would give my ſelf over to my former courſe of life, where I to live, and
on my death-bed to undergo the Agonies and Terror which ſince my ſentance I have
done, I would firſt chuſe to undergo the cruelleſt Death that can be afflicted.</p>
