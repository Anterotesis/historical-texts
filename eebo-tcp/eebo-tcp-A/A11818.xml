            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For if men knew either the diſpoſition of their ſoules by Creation, or the diſtemper of their ſoules by corruption, they would eaſily eſcape this deluſion. 1. The ſoule is a ſpirituall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, whoſe originall is from God, and therefore its reſt muſt be in God; as the Rivers runne into the Sea, and as every body reſts in its center.

            <p>2. Conſider the ſoule as it is now in this ſtate of corruption, nothing can now content it, but that which can cure it. The ſoule is full of ſinne, which is the moſt painefull ſickneſſe; hence the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares wicked men to the raging waves of the Sea, that is never at reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and<note place="margin">Eſa. 57. 1.</note> dirt; what will you doe to comfort him that is heart-ſicke?

            <p>Many have already written on<note place="margin">Obiect. 2.</note> theſe ſubiects, and therefore this is ſuperfluous.</p>
            <p>True it is; Many have written<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> on this ſubiect largely, and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as, Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> in ſeaven Treatiſes, abridged by Maſter <hi>Stephen Egerton,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Iohn Downam</hi> in a large and uſefull worke, and (that I may not forget him, whom, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, I ſhould firſt have mentioned) the Reverend Deane of <hi>Worceſter</hi> Doctor <hi>Hall,</hi> that true Christian Engliſh <hi>Seneca.</hi> Alſo Maſter <hi>Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> whoſe <hi>generall directions for comfortable walking with God</hi>

are deſervedly approved of the moſt iudicious. Yet I anſwer, firſt, That is never too often taught, that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſufficiently learned. Secondly, In the mouth of two or three witneſſes the truth is confirmed. Thirdly, As God is much glorified, ſo the Church is much edified by varietie of gifts; <hi>Paul, Apollos,</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas are yours, and you Chriſts.</hi> Fourthly; The Chriſtian and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Reader ſhall find in this ſome things new, other things expreſſed in a new manner, all digeſted in ſuch a Method, with ſuch brevity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity, as was neceſſary to make the Booke a <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But it exceeds the limits and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion<note place="margin">Obiect. 2.</note> of a Letter.</p>
            <p>The firſt Coppy was more briefe, upon occaſion of a ſecond Letter, wherein ſome other caſes were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, the iudicious Author not onely handled theſe Arguments largely in his publicke Miniſtery,
<pb facs="tcp:7061:13"/>
but alſo added more particulars for his friends full ſatisfaction in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coppy, hence it came to this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>When you commend your<note place="margin">2</note> ſelfe to God alone by praier, that night (as every good Chriſtian uſually doth) then ſet the time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loted, apart for that holy work; ſetting your ſelfe in a ſpecial ſort to ſeek the <hi>Lord,</hi> as the Saints of<note place="margin">2 Chr. 20.

rule</hi> whereby you may know more clearely &amp; diſtinctly, what is truth, what is falſhood, what is good, what is bad; whom you ſhould obey, &amp; what manner of perſon you ſhould be, and what you ſhould doe, and the like: The ſecond ſerveth to direct you how <hi>to make a right and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble application</hi> of your ſelfe, and of your actions to the <hi>Rule.</hi>

                  <p>By communicating your goods and common gifts of God in this ſort, you make your ſelfe <note n="g" place="margin">Luk. 16. 9</note>

                  <p>Fifthly, If yet your ſoule be<note place="margin">5</note> diſquieted within you at anie croſſes; that you may quiet your ſoule, <hi>you muſt not</hi> (as moſt doe,) <hi>take onely into the one skale of your conſideration, the waight and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of your croſſes,</hi> together with ſuch and ſuch aggravations; <hi>but withall put into the other skale the manifold mercies and favours of God,</hi> both in the evils you have eſcaped, and in the benefits which heretofore you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and doe now enjoy, and which (you beleeving) have cauſe to hope to receive hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>the upright mans acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> as they come from a good beginning, ſo they <hi>are directed to</hi>

For ſo farre forth as a mans health, and well-fare both of body and ſoule, lyeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in the way to glorifie <hi>God;</hi> hee may in that reſpect ayme at them in his actions.

                     <hi>When he ſaid, Glorifie thy Son; and prayed that his Church might be glorified;</hi> here he had reſpect <hi>unto himſelfe, and unto man;</hi> But when he ſaid, <hi>that thy Sonne may glorifie thee;</hi> here he made Gods <hi>glory</hi> his utmoſt end, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marke <hi>which for it ſelfe hee ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>upright</hi> mans ayme at his owne, and at his neighbours goods, is not for themſelves, as if
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:7061:187"/>
his deſire ended there; but in reference to GOD the chiefe Good, and the higheſt end of all things.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, ſuch is GODS wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and goodnes, that he hath ſet before man, <hi>evill</hi> and <hi>good: Evill,</hi> that followeth upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing and diſhonouring him by ſinne, that man might feare and avoyd ſinne; <hi>Good</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of reward, that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon faith and indevour to obey, that he might hope, and be better induced to beleeve and obey. This GOD did, knowing that man hath need of all reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable helps to affright him from evill, and to allure him to good. Now, God having ſet theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man, man may and ought for theſe good purpoſes to ſet them before himſelfe. Yet the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man ſtandeth ſo <hi>ſtraight,</hi> and <hi>onely to God,</hi> that (ſo farre as he knoweth his owne heart) he thus reſolved, that if there were
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:7061:187"/>
no feare of puniſhment, nor hope of reward: if there were neither <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Hell,</hi> he would inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to pleaſe and glorifie GOD, even out of that duty hee oweth to him, and out of that high and awful eſtimation which he hath of Gods <hi>Soveraigntie,</hi> and from that entire love which hee bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth unto him. He that ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in doing of common and earthly buſineſſe (though they concerne his owne good) hath a will to doe them with an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly mind, and to an heavenly end principally, certainly hee ſtandeth well and uprightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, albeit, intemptations and feares he doth not alwayes feele the ſaid reſolution.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>hypocrite</hi> not ſo; <hi>hee</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, An upright man may know hee is upright, by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that follow upon his well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, his chiefe inquiry is, and <hi>hee doth obſerve, what good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by it, and</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Phil. 1. 12 20.</note> 
                     <hi>what glory God hath had</hi> or may <hi>have; rather then what</hi> earthly <hi>credit and benefit hee hath gotten to himſelfe.</hi> Or if this latter thruſt in it ſelfe before the other (as it will oft-times in the beſt) he is greatly diſpleaſed with himſelfe for it. The hypocrit not ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all that he harkeneth after, &amp; is pleaſed with, after hee hath done a good deed, is what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe it hath amongſt men, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, when an <hi>upright man</hi> hath done a prayſe-worthy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is not puft up with pride, and high conceit of his owne worth, glorying in himſelfe;
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:7061:188"/>
but <hi>hee is humbly thankefull unto God.

               <p>I reduce the impediments un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two heads:</p>

of heart, ſomewhat like to <hi>peace of Conſcience,</hi> which yet is but a <hi>falſe peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Cauſeleſſe doubting, and falſe feare that a mans eſtate</hi> touching his ſalvation <hi>is not good; albeit God be indeed at peace with him;</hi> Hence followeth trouble and anguiſh of heart ſome-what like unto that of <hi>Helliſh deſpaire,</hi> diſturbing his <hi>true peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Either of theſe doe hinder peace.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> hindereth the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> hindereth the <hi>fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and comfortable enioying of peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It hath beene an old device of <hi>Satan</hi> when he would keepe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man from that which is <hi>true,</hi> to obtrude upon him that which ſhall ſeeme to be true, but is <hi>falſe.</hi> Thus he did in the firſt <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 24. 5</note> 
                  <hi>calling of the Iewes,</hi> and (to mee is more than probable) will doe at their <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 24. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>ſecond calling.</hi> When hee ſaw
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:7061:236"/>
they had an expectation of the <hi>true Chriſt,</hi> he, to divert and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them from the true Chriſt, ſetteth up <hi>falſe Chriſts.</hi> Even ſo in the matter of peace: If he can ſo delude men that they ſhall content themſelves with a <hi>falſe Peace,</hi> hee knoweth that they will never ſeeke for that which is <hi>true.</hi> It is a common practice with the <hi>Devill,</hi> to endevour to make all that are not in ſtate of grace, to preſume that they are.</p>
               <p>Alſo ſuch is his cunning and malice, that when any man is in the ſtate of grace, he will caſt all the doubts and perils hee can, to make that eſtate doubtfull and diſcomfortable, to <hi>vexe</hi> and to<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 7. 11.</note> wearie him, if hee cannot drive him to <hi>deſpaire,</hi> knowing, that if he could drive him into, &amp; hold him in utter deſpaire, he were as certainly in his power as if hee did preſume. Now the <hi>Heart</hi> of man ſo farre as it is <hi>Vnſanctified,</hi> being <note n="c" place="margin">Ier. 17. 9 9</note> 
                  <hi>deceitfull above all things,</hi>
                  <pb n="440" facs="tcp:7061:237"/>
is moſt apt to yeeld to <hi>Satan</hi> in both theſe caſes. Whence it is that there are very many which bragge of much peace, and yet have leaſt of it. And many feare they have no peace who yet have much of it.</p>
               <p>Wherfore the Rule is, Beleeve not either your deceitfull heart, or the Devill, when they tel you either that you are in ſtate of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or in ſtate of damnation: But beleeve the Scripture what it ſaith in either.</p>
               <p>You may know when theſe perſwaſions come from your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull heart, or from the Devil, thus,</p>
               <p>Firſt, If the meanes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to either be from falſe grounds, or from miſapplication of true grounds.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the concluſions, inferred from either perſwaſion, be to keep you in a ſinful courſe, and to keep you, or to drive you from God, as, to make you think
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:7061:237"/>
that you need not be ſo ſtrict in godlineſſe, or that now it is in vaine, or to late, too turne &amp; ſeek unto GOD, then it is from Satan and from a deceived heart, and you muſt not beleeve them. But if theſe perſwaſions be from a right applicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of true grounds, and doe produce theſe good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, to drive you to God, in prayſe, or prayer, and unto a care to pleaſe God, they are from his gracious Spirit.</p>

                  <p>This <hi>feare,</hi> while it keepeth due meaſure, cauſeth a man to bee <hi>circumſpect and watchfull,</hi> leſt he fall, it ſpurreth him on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to repent, and quickens him to aske pardon and grace to recover when he is fallen, yea, an excellent means to prevent trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to procure peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.

                  <p>This <hi>feare</hi> may riſe either from <hi>Naturall diſtempers,</hi> Satan joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with them; Or from <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall temptations,</hi> riſing from cauſeleſſe doubts.</p>

Then, ſecondly, by reaſon of the intercourſe of the

<pb n="490" facs="tcp:7061:262"/>
And when they have not well known what they have done or ſaid, have beene heard to breake out into oathes, curſing, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous ſpeeches againſt GOD and his Word, who were never heard to doe the like before.</p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>troubles</hi> may be knowne<note place="margin">Differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betweene trouble ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from bodily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and that of trouble of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> from true <hi>trouble of Conſcience,</hi> by the ſtrangeneſſe, unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, abſurditie, and ſenſeleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their conceits in other things, as to think they have no heart, and to ſay they cannot doe that which indeed they doe, and a thouſand other odde conceits which ſtanders by ſee to be moſt falſe.

and then in the <hi>regenerate,</hi> which doth not in the <hi>unregenerate,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the intermiſſions of their fits. Their deſires will be found to be different, and if they both recover, the one returneth to his wonted courſe of holines with increaſe: the other (except God worke with the affliction to converſion) continueth in his accuſtomed wickedneſſe. It plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God, that, for the moſt part, his owne children who are thus diſtempered, have the ſtrength of their <hi>Melancholy</hi> worne out and ſubdued before they dye, at which time they have ſomeſenſe of Gods favor to their comfort; But if their diſeaſe continue, it is poſſible that they may <hi>die raving</hi> and in ſeeming, (if you judge by their ſpeeches) <hi>deſpairing,</hi> which is not to be imputed unto them, but to their <hi>diſeaſe,</hi> or unto <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> working by the diſeaſe; if they gave good teſtimony of holineſſe in former times.

When theſe troubles are meerly from bodily diſtempers, though they be not <hi>troubles of conſcience,</hi> yet they make a man uncapable of the ſenſe of <hi>peace of conſcience.</hi> Therfore whoſoever would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the benefit of the peace of his conſcience, muſt doe what in him lyeth, to preuent or remove theſe diſtempers.

that when the troubled perſon is himſelfe, that he be moved to <hi>prayer,</hi> and that others then <hi>pray</hi> much with him, and at all times pray much for him.</p>
                  <p>When theſe <hi>troubles are mixt,</hi> comming partly from naturall diſtemper, and partly from ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall temptation: then the <hi>reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die muſt be mixt</hi> of helpes natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſpirituall.

But thoſe whoſe trouble is meerly out of ſpirituall temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and trouble of conſcience, although for the time it is very grievous, and hardly removed, and ſometimes long before they receive a ſatisfying anſwer to their doubts; yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> once they receive ſatisfaction and comfort, it doth <hi>hold and laſt</hi> untill there fall out ſome new temptation, and new matter of feare. This is becauſe their <hi>Phantaſies</hi> and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories are not diſturbed in ſuch ſort as the others were.</p>
                  <p>The ſeeming grounds of feares<note place="margin">The grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of falſe feares.</note> that a man is not in ſtate of grace when yet he is, are for varietie almoſt infinite. I have reduced them into this order, and unto theſe heads:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, when they are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from that, they ſay then that <hi>they feare GOD will not pardon.</hi> When they are driven from this by cauſing them to take notice of the ſignes of Gods actual love to them which give proofe that he will ſave them. Then,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>they will question the truth</hi> of Gods love, and favour. But being put upon the ttyall whether God hath not already juſtified them, and given them faith in Chriſt; which are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proofes of his love: then,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>they will ſeeme to have grounds to doubt whether they have faith,</hi> from which they are driven by putting them to the tryall of their <hi>Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> then,</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>they doubt, and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect ſtrongly, that they are not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,</hi> which being undeniably proved: then,</p>

                  <p>This is the eaſieſt, moſt famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, and the moſt naturall method (ſo farre as I can conceive) both in propounding, and in remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving falſe feares.</p>

                  <p>This <hi>place</hi> is to be underſtood<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 20</note> of <hi>iudging of particular actions,</hi> namely, <hi>whether a man love his</hi>

                     <hi>Thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee.</hi> This is the full ſcope of the place. Yet this I muſt needs ſay, that the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> hath inſtanced in ſuch an act, namely, of hearty lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the brethren, which is an infallible ſigne of being in ſtate of grace: whereby (except in caſe of extreame melancholy or phrenſie, and in the brunt of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent temptation) a man may judge, whether at that preſent he be tranſlated from death to life, yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>If any ſhall think the place to be underſtood of judging the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he muſt diſtinguiſh between that judgement which the heart doth give rightly, and <hi>de iure,</hi> and that which it giveth erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly.
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:7061:283"/>
But ſuppoſe, that you trying your ſelves by this, your <hi>hearts doe condemne you of not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the brethren,</hi> can you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude hence that you ſhall be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally damned? <hi>God forbid?</hi> All that you can inferre, is this; you cannot have boldneſſe to pray unto him untill you love them, nor can you aſſure your ſelves that you ſhal have your petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s granted. And the worſt you can conclude is, that now for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you are not in ſtate of grace, or at the leaſt you <hi>want proofe</hi> of being in ſtate of grace. You muſt then uſe all Gods meanes of being ingrafted into Chriſt, and muſt love the children of GOD, that you may have proofe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Did <note n="m" place="margin">Acts 26 10, 11</note> 
                     <hi>Paul love the brethren</hi> when hee breathed out threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; was, as he himſelfe ſaith, mad againſt them?

                  <p>Some will yet ſay, certainely we are <hi>Reprobates.</hi> For we have <note place="margin">Feare of being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell that Chriſt is in them, removed.</note> according to the command of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> tryed <hi>whether we be in the faith,</hi> or no, and <hi>whether Chriſt be in us,</hi> but we finde neither; the <note n="o" place="margin">2 Cor. 13 5.</note>

                  <p>Some give this reaſon of their<note place="margin">Doubts of Gods love becauſe of their grie vous affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</note> doubt. <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>afflicted</hi> them, and ſtill doth <hi>Plague</hi> them, yea, albeit they have profeſſed the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they are in ſome thing or other chaſtened daily, in ſo much that they ſeeme to bee in the condition of thoſe whom GOD hath threatned to <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 28. 20.</note>

                  <p>Such weake and inconſiderate reaſonings are incident to thoſe<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> whom GOD truely loveth, Did not the <hi>holy men of GOD</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>They learne, that God doth oft ſmile on his enemies, and

                  <p>In theſe caſes God doth not uſually afflict his children with his heavie rod.</p>

Children,</hi> that is, ſhew that they would pleaſe him, indevouring to do what they are able, though it be with much imperfection, then GOD will not ſtrike, but <note n="m" place="margin">Mal. 3. 17</note> 
                     <hi>ſpareth them, as a Father ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his onely ſonne that ſerveth him.</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, when forbearance of puniſhment, and when fruits and tokens of kindneſſe will <hi>reclaime</hi> his children from evill, and doe prove incitements unto good; <hi>God</hi> in this caſe alſo, like a wiſe and loving Father, had rather draw them by the <note n="n" place="margin">Hoſ. 11. 4</note> 
                     <hi>cords of love,</hi> then drive them with the <hi>laſhes of his diſpleaſure.</hi> Thus you ſee God may love his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and not bee alwayes affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of them.

                  <p>Well, doe you <hi>proſper?</hi> Then take notice of Gods goodneſſe towards you with thankſgiving;

                  <p>Firſt, it may be a juſt <hi>correction</hi> of them, for their not ſhewing love to God, and becauſe they doe in part <hi>forſake</hi> him by their ſinnes.

                     <pb n="564" facs="tcp:7061:299"/>Secondly, God exerciſeth his beloved ones with many feares, horrors, and doubts, to <hi>prevent</hi> that <hi>spirituall pride</hi> which elſe would be in them and that <hi>ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency</hi> which elſe they would conceive to be in themſelves; If they ſhould alwayes have ſenſe of inward &amp; ſpiritual comforts, and ſhould not ſometimes have <note n="t" place="margin">2 Cor. 12 7</note>

                  <p>This which I have ſaid in<note place="margin">Caution.</note> commendation of <hi>little faith,</hi> is onely to keepe him that hath no more, from deſpaire. Let none herby pleaſe or content himſelfe with his little faith, not ſtriving to grow, and be ſtrong in faith.

                     <pb n="585" facs="tcp:7061:309"/>Firſt, if you (having ſo ſure a word and promiſe) doe yet doubt and feare ſo much as you ſay, it is your great ſinne, and I muſt blame you now, in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours name, as he did his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples then, ſaying, <note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 8. 26</note>

                  <p>And as for being moved with ſome feare at the thought of the day of Iudgement; who can thinke of that <hi>great appearance</hi> before ſo glorious a <hi>Maieſty,</hi> (ſuch as <note n="s" place="margin">Mat. 16. 27</note>

                     <pb n="587" facs="tcp:7061:310"/>You have other and better things to doe in this caſe, than to make ſuch dangerous concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>viz.</hi> that you have no faith, &amp;c. upon ſuch weake grounds.

                  <p>Vnwillingneſſe to dye may come from theſe cauſes.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, You may bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to die, becauſe of <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the ſuper abundant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable excellencies of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of Saints departed,</hi> which if you knew, you would bee willing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Feare of death and

comming to Iudgement, doth (for the moſt part) riſe <hi>from a conſcience guilty of the ſentence of condemnation,</hi> being without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that, when you dye, you ſhall goe to heaven.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore if you would be<note place="margin">Helpes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fear of death.</note> free from troubleſome feare of death and Iudgement, Learne (1) to <hi>thinke meanely and baſely of the world,</hi> in compariſon of thoſe better things provided for them that love God, and uſe all things of the world accordingly, without <note n="a" place="margin">Pſa. 62. 10</note>

                     <hi>might be ſwallowed up of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you would doe all this in earneſt, you would be ſo farre

from feare of death, that you would, if you were put to your choice, with the <note n="d" place="margin">Phil. 1. 23</note> 
                     <hi>Apoſtle, chooſe to hee diſſolved, and to bee with Chriſt, which is beſt of all,</hi> and ſo farre from fearing the <hi>day of Iudgement,</hi> that you would love and <note n="n" place="margin">2 Tim 4. 8</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, what if you cannot<note place="margin">An anſwer to thoſe which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion their faith, for want of feeling.</note> attaine to ſo high a pitch in your Faith, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> had, are you ſo <hi>ambitious,</hi> that no other degrees of Faith ſhall ſatisfie you? Orare you ſo <hi>fooliſh,</hi> as thence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that you have no Faith.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Whereas you ſay,
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:7061:312"/>
you are without feeling, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you feare you have no faith. I acknowledge that <hi>want of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and want of ſenſe of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> is that which doth more trouble GODS tender-hearted Children, and make them more doubt of <hi>Gods love,</hi> and of <hi>their iuſtification,</hi> than any thing elſe, whereas I know nothing that giveth them loſſe cauſe.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, <hi>What meane you by feeling?</hi> If you meane the <hi>enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the things promiſed, and hoped for, by inward ſenſe;</hi> This is to overthrow the nature, and to put an end to the uſe of faith and hope. For <note n="p" place="margin">Heb. 11. 1</note> 
                     <hi>Faith is the ground of things</hi> hoped for, and the <hi>evidence</hi> of things not ſeene. And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> faith, <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 8 24</note> 
                     <hi>Hope that is</hi> ſeene <hi>is not hope.</hi> Indeede <hi>faith</hi> giveth a <hi>preſent being</hi> of the thing promiſed to the beleever, but it is a being, not in ſenſe, but in hope, and aſſured expectation of the thing promiſed: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:7061:313"/>
the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaking of our ſpirituall converſation on earth, ſaith, <hi>We</hi> 
                     <note n="r" place="margin">2 Cor. 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7</note> 
                     <hi>walke by faith, not by ſight.</hi> Theſe two; faith and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, are <hi>oppoſite</hi> one to the other in this ſenſe; For <hi>when wee ſhall live by ſight, and feeling,</hi> then, we ſhall ceaſe <hi>to live by faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, If by <hi>feeling</hi> you meane <hi>a ioyous and comfortable aſſurance that you are in Gods ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> and that you ſhall be ſaved, and therefore becauſe you want this joyous aſſurance, you think you have no Faith, you muſt know this concluſion will not follow.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Faith,</hi> whereby you are ſaved and ſet into ſtate of grace, and this <hi>comfortable aſſurance</hi> that you are in ſtate of grace and ſhall be ſaved, <hi>doe differ,</hi> and are not the ſame. It is true, <hi>Aſſurance</hi> is an effect of <hi>faith</hi> in al that have this aſſurance, yet it is not ſuch a <hi>proper and neceſſary effect,</hi> which is <hi>inſeparable</hi> from the very being
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:7061:313"/>
of faith in man at all times. For you may have <hi>ſaving Faith,</hi> yet at ſometime be without the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable aſſurance</hi> of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>To beleeve in Chriſt to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>is one thing,</hi> and to know aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly that you ſhall be ſaved, is <hi>another.</hi> For <hi>Faith</hi> is a <hi>direct act</hi> of the reaſonable ſoule, receiving Chriſt, and Salvation offered by God with him. <hi>Aſſurance</hi> riſeth from a <hi>reflect act</hi> of the ſoule, namely, when the ſoule by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe returneth upon it ſelfe, and can witneſſe that it hath the afore-mentioned grace of faith, whereby a man can ſay, <hi>I know that I beleeve that Christ Ieſus is mine,</hi> and <hi>I know that I beleeve, that the promiſes of the Gospell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto mee.</hi> The holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are written for both theſe ends, that <hi>firſt</hi> Faith, <hi>and then</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of faith and hope ſhould be wrought in men. <note n="ſ" place="margin">Ioh. 20. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>Theſe things are written,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Goſpell, <hi>that you may beleeve,
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:7061:314"/>
that Ieſus is the Chriſt the Sonne of God, and that beleeving you might have life through his name.</hi> Againe, <hi>theſe things have I writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> (ſaith the ſame <note n="t" place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtles</hi>) <hi>to you that beleeve on the name of the Sonne of GOD;</hi> that yee may know <hi>that you have eternall life, and that you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,</hi> that is, continue to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and increaſe in beleeving <hi>on the name of the Sonne of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man is <hi>ſaved</hi> by <hi>faith,</hi> but hath <hi>comfort</hi> in hope of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by <hi>Aſſurance;</hi> So that the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſpirituall life,</hi> in reſpect of us, doth ſubſiſt in Faith, not in Aſſurance &amp; Feeling. And that is the ſtrongeſt and moſt approved faith, which cleaveth to Chriſt and to his promiſes, and which holdeth his owne, without the helpe of feeling. For, albeit <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance</hi> giveth unto us a more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident certainety of our good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, yet <hi>faith,</hi> even without this will hold us <hi>certaine</hi> in this good
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:7061:314"/>
eſtate, whether we be aſſured or not.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore ſome <hi>Divines</hi> have well conceived of a <hi>double cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie</hi> of things apprehended by mans judgment. The firſt is <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of Adherence,</hi> and <hi>cleaving faſt</hi> to the thing it beleeveth, cauſing a man (from the bare aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and conſent to the truth and goodneſſe of the promiſe, and from the Commandement of God in his Word, which bids him beleeve and reſt on his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe) for to <hi>cleave</hi> to the promiſe and to <hi>relie</hi> on it, and to <hi>obey</hi> that Commandement, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth him to beleeve in Chriſt Ieſus; yea, <hi>though this truth bee not otherwiſe ſo evident and cleare to the underſtanding,</hi> as to ſatisfie mans natural reaſon. For though <hi>Faith</hi> in its minority, cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes comprehend to the full, how, and by what meanes, or why in reaſon, the thing promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſhould be fulfilled; yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:7061:315"/>
it conceiveth thus much, <hi>that the things of God are not fully comprehended by humane reaſon,</hi> and that the <hi>truths of God are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,</hi> whether it comprehend them or not; will <hi>firſt beleeve and reſt on the promiſe,</hi> and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conſider how it may be, ſo farre as is fit to be underſtood by reaſon. Hence it is that albeit reaſon, as it is now corrupt, will ſtill be <note place="margin">Ioh. 3. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>obiecting,</hi> and will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with nothing, but what it may know by ſenſe, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration from <hi>Artificiall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments;</hi> yet <note n="a" place="margin">Rom 4. 19, 20. Heb 11 8. 11</note> 
                     <hi>Faith, even above and againſt</hi> ſenſe, and all naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, <hi>will give credit unto, and reſt upon the bare naked divine wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Word of truth, for his ſake that doth ſpeake it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a <hi>certaintie of Evidence,</hi> namely, when the thing beleeved is not onely ſaid to be true and good, but a man doth finde it ſo to be by <hi>ſenſe and experience,</hi> and is ſo <hi>evident</hi> to
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:7061:315"/>
mans reaſon convincing it by force of <hi>Argument,</hi> taken from the Cauſes, Effects, Properties, Signes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Contraries, and the like, that it hath nothing to object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the thing propounded to be beleeved. The certaintie of <hi>Adherence,</hi> is the certaintie of <hi>Faith.</hi> The certaintie of <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> is the certaintie of <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The certainty of <hi>Aſſurance</hi> and evidence is of excellent uſe, for it maketh a man <note n="b" place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 8 10</note> 
                     <hi>fruitfull in good workes,</hi> and doth fill him ful of joy and comfort: therefore it muſt by all meanes be gotten, yet, it is not of it ſelfe ſo ſtrong, nor ſo conſtant, nor ſo infallible as the certainty of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence</hi> is. For ſenſe and reaſon ſince the fall (even in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, though they will lay ſome foundation in the Rules of Faith to proceed by, yet erring in, or miſapplying the rule) are weake, variable, and their concluſions are
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:7061:316"/>
not ſo certaine, as thoſe of pure Faith: Becauſe <hi>Faith</hi> buildeth onely upon <hi>Diuine Teſtimonie,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 18. Heb. 11. 11</note> concluding without reaſoning or diſputing, yea, many times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reaſoning.</p>
                  <p>So that notwithſtanding the excellent, and needfull uſe of <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> and certainty of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; it is <hi>Faith</hi> and the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Adherence, whereby even in feares and doubts a man clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth faſt to the promiſes, and is that which we muſt truſt unto, and is the <hi>Cable</hi> wee muſt hold by, leſt we make ſhip wracke of all, when wee are aſſaulted with our greateſt temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, for then many times our <hi>Aſſurance</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us to the mercy of the winds and Seas, as Marriners ſpeake. If you have <hi>Faith,</hi> though you have <hi>little or no feeling,</hi> you are yet ſure enough of <hi>Salvation,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, though not in your owne apprehenſion. When both can be had, it is beſt, for then you
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:7061:316"/>
have moſt ſtrength, and moſt comfort, giving you cheareful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in all your troubles, but that <hi>certainty of Faith,</hi> and <hi>clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> to the naked word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, is that to which you muſt truſt.</p>

                  <p>If you doubt, you were never ſufficiently humbled, then reade Chap. 16. Sect. 6.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider rightly the nature and proper acts of Faith, leſt you conceive that to be <hi>faith</hi> which is not, and that to be <hi>no faith,</hi> which is.</p>

                  <p>By this which hath beene ſaid<note place="margin">Many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that they have faith, which have none</note> touching the nature of Faith, many, who thought they had <hi>faith,</hi> may ſee that yet they have none.</p>
                  <p>For they onely beleeve in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall that there is a <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and a <hi>Saviour,</hi> who offereth grace and ſalvation to mankinde, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they preſume.

that particular conſent of will, and accepting of CHRIST up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch tearmes as he is offered.

                  <p>By this which hath beene ſaid, others who have Faith indeed, may know they have it, namely, if they ſo beleeve the Covenant of Grace eſtabliſhed in Chriſt, that with all their harts they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of him, and it, ſo that they will <hi>ſtand to it on their parts,</hi> as

                  <p>It is more then you can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> know, whether they have more ſaving grace than you; for when you ſhall with a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table eye looke upon the outſide of anothers behaviour, and ſhall look with a ſevere and ſearching eye into the corruptions of your owne inſide, you may eaſily, through modeſtie and charitie, <hi>thinke others better than your ſelves,</hi> and it is good for you ſo to doe; an errour in that caſe, if you doe commit it, is tolerable.

                  <p>But let it bee granted, that many of ſhort ſtanding in the <hi>Schoole of Christianity,</hi> have got the ſtart of you in grace: If it was through <hi>Gods</hi> grace accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying their diligence, and from his juſt hand upon you, following your negligence, then they are to bee <hi>commended,</hi> and you are to be <hi>humbled,</hi> and to be provoked unto an <hi>holy aemulation</hi> by them to quicken your pace, and to double your diligence.

                  <p>If it were true, that all which you have done were in <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,</hi> then untill you <hi>repent</hi> of

your Hypocriſie, and <hi>be upright,</hi> you may juſtly feare as much; yet you muſt not deſperately conclude, that you ſhall fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from your profeſſion; but be you quickned and ſtirred up by this feare to <hi>abandon Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie,</hi> and to <hi>ſerve the LORD in ſinceritis;</hi> and hereby <hi>make your calling and election ſure,</hi> that you may not fall, and then you have Gods word for it, that <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 15. 1 2. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>you ſhall not fall.</hi>

                  <p>Many thinke that they are Hypocrites, which yet are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere; wherefore try whether you be an Hypocrite or upright, by the ſignes of uprightneſſe before delivered, Chapter 12. Sect. 1.</p>
                  <p>Onely, for the preſent, note<note place="margin">Note.</note> this; When was it knowne, that an Hypocrite did ſo ſee his hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, as to have it a burden to him, and to be weary of it, and to confeſſe it, and bewaile it, &amp; to aske forgiveneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

                  <p>Moreover, conſider this, How can it juſtly bee concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that hee ſhould be an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,</hi> that from an <hi>inward principle,</hi> from the inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his owne heart, ſhall, with a <hi>ſetled and deliberate will,</hi> out of love to <hi>God</hi> and goodneſſe chiefly, and out of hatred of ſin, <hi>reſolve,</hi> to his power, to abſtaine from all ſinne, and to doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſhall know to bee his

this caſe. And whence is this but from his folly and pride? Oh, if you who are troubled in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, could be every way <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in your ſelves,</hi> you would quickly be <hi>ſomething in God,</hi> and you ſhould quickly know it. If you would be <hi>humbled, and not nouriſh this pride in you,</hi> you ſhould quickly know your ſtate with comfort.</p>
               <p>I know many of you will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that I ſhould charge you with pride; you judging your ſelves to be ſo baſe and vile. Wel for all that, I will now prove to your faces, that <hi>it is humility you want,</hi> and if it were not that you were proud, you would judge of things otherwiſe than you doe.</p>
               <p>For firſt you cannot beleeve in CHRIST (you ſay) becauſe you cannot obey him, and bee dutifull as a good wife to him: If you could obey, then you could beleeve that he were yours and you his; whereas, you muſt
<pb n="760" facs="tcp:7061:395"/>
                  <hi>firſt beleeve in Chriſt,</hi> and take him for your husband, and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve he is your husband,</hi> before you can obey him. Can a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or ſhould a woman obey a man, and carry her ſelfe towards him as to her husband, before that ſhee beleeve that hee is her husband? If you could obey as you ſhould; Oh, then you thinke CHRIST would love you; It were well if you could love CHRIST, and obey him, it is your dutie. But to thinke he will not ſave you, becauſe you have no goodneſſe or worth in you to cauſe him to love you, is not this from hence, you would be <hi>ſome thing in your ſelfe,</hi> for which Chriſt ſhould caſt his love upon you. Chriſt <note n="*" place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 19 20</note> 
                  <hi>marrieth</hi> you not becauſe you were good, but that hee might make you good, that you might know him, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But you doe not ſee this his<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> worke in you, that he hath made you good, therefore you doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="761" facs="tcp:7061:395"/>I anſwer: though it may be in<note place="margin">Anſw</note> you, yet Chriſt will not let you ſee it, becauſe you will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that <hi>hee is yours,</hi> and you his. Bring your heart to this, (and you have reaſon for it) for the <hi>Father</hi> giveth him, and he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth himſelf to you in the Word and Sacraments; then you will love him, and obey him abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. Is not ſhe a <hi>proud and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh woman,</hi> that may have <hi>a Kings ſonne,</hi> upon Condition that ſhee will ſtrip her ſelfe of all her own proper goods, and let <hi>him</hi> endow her at his pleaſure, yet ſtill ſhee will be <hi>whining and diſcontented with her ſelfe,</hi> becauſe ſhee hath nothing of her owne to bring to him, for which hee ſhould love her.</p>
               <p>But you will ſtill ſay, Chriſt<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> hath not endued you with ſo much grace, as to be able to doe as you ſhould.</p>
               <p>Content your ſelves, If you<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> would but ſee that he hath mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:7061:396"/>
you to himſelfe, you then would uſe the meanes which hee hath appointed, whereby he giveth his graces, you would be thankfull for what you have, you would pray &amp; wait his pleaſure for more, relying on his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for how much, and when. If you doe not thus, then in this you ſhew your ſelves proud, in that you preferre your owne wiſdom before his.</p>
               <p>Let it be ſuppoſed that you are not proud, ſtanding upon termes of having any goodneſſe in you, for which Chriſt ſhould love you, but you would with all your hearts bee all that you are in him, and would be behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to him for taking you, poore, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="763" facs="tcp:7061:396"/>
of cauſleſſe doubting; and that is <hi>to bee too well conceited of, and to bee wedded to your owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to your owne opinion</hi> in judging your ſelves. Vnderſtand it in this particular. The holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> give you to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand (I ſpeake ſtill to ſuch onely as with all their ſoules would pleaſe GOD, yet can feele no comfort) that your ſtate, in point of <hi>Salvation,</hi> is good.

Now when you will <hi>preferre your owne opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſenſe</hi> (ſuch as it is) <hi>before the iudgement of Gods word of truth, and before the iudgement of
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:7061:397"/>
Gods Ministers, iudging according to this word.</hi> Are you not highly conceited of your owne opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And are you not <hi>ſtrangely proud?</hi> though it may be you thought otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if you underſtand things aright, you muſt have a meane conceit of your owne underſtanding, of your owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and of your owne ſenſe. For as you muſt <hi>deny your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and be poore in reſpect of conceit of any goodneſſe in you, if you would ever looke to have any goodneſſe from Chriſt; ſo you muſt deny your <hi>owne opinion, knowledge, ſenſe, and wiſedome,</hi> if you would know ſpirituall things aright, and would become wiſe through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And that it may appeare now, that you are not too well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of your owne opinion touching your eſtate, make uſe in this caſe of <hi>Experienced Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>
                  <pb n="765" facs="tcp:7061:397"/>
but eſpecially of <hi>iudicious and godly Ministers.</hi> Let not feare<note place="margin">An excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent helpe making way to peace of conſcience</note> either of troubling them, nor yet of ſhaming your ſelfe hinder you. But do it according to theſe directions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Acquaint ſuch a one with<note place="margin">Rules how to lay open our ſtate to others, when the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is troubled.</note> your caſe <hi>betimes;</hi> keepe it not to your ſelfe too long. For then like a bone long out of joynt, and a feſtred wound, it will not be ſo well, nor ſo eaſily cured, beſide the vexation in the meane time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, deale <hi>plainely, true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and <hi>fully,</hi> in ſetting downe the cauſe of your trouble, not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as many, telling one part of your griefe, and not another, which hath beene the cauſe that they have gone away without comfort. Either tell all or none in this caſe. If you thinke him not faithfull, reveale nothing thereof to him: If you judge him a fit man, then ſhew all, as you will doe your bodily mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:7061:398"/>
and diſeaſes to a Surgeon, or Phyſician, if you would have them cured.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Beleeve them rather than your ſelves in this caſe, hearken to them, and make uſe of their judgement and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and bee not preſumptuous of your owne underſtanding and feeling. In times of your feares and doubts <hi>be not raſh</hi> and ſudden in judging your ſelves.

                  <hi>you are the moſt unfit and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to iudge of your ſelves in this caſe.</hi> For when groundleſſe ſuſpition, and cauſeleſſe feares have like a head-ſtrong Colt got a head, and hath caught the bit in his teeth, it will (like to other paſſions) carry you head long whither it liſteth, contrary to al right, reaſon, and underſtanding. In ſuch ſuſpicion &amp; feare of your eſtate, you are like a <hi>iealous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in the fit of her jealouſie,
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:7061:398"/>
and feare of her husbands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe; ſhe will <hi>picke mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> out of every thing he doth, (though he ſtudy to give her no occaſion of ſuſpition) <hi>to increaſe her ſuspition</hi> of him; If hee be ſomewhat ſtrange and auſtere, then (ſhe ſaith) he loveth her not but others better. If he be kinde to her, then ſhe thinkes that this is but to dazel &amp; blind her eyes, that hee may without ſuſpition give himſelfe to other women. Deale now ingenuouſly, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer whether it is not, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it hath not beene ſo with you? I pray marke your abſurd and contrary reaſonings. When you <hi>proſper,</hi> thence you inferre, ſure God doth not love mee, for whom he loveth, he correcteth. When God <hi>whips you</hi> well for this, and doth caſt you into grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous <hi>afflictions,</hi> thence you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, ſure God is wroth with mee, and doth not love mee. If you bee <hi>troubled in Conſcience,</hi>
                  <pb n="768" facs="tcp:7061:399"/>
Oh, then GOD writes bitter things againſt you, you can have no peace. And when he giveth you <hi>quiet of minde,</hi> Oh, then you feare all riſeth from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, your caſe is naught, and it wasbetter with you when you had trouble in minde. Is it not thus? Are you not aſhamed that you have beene thus ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and abſurd in your owne reaſonings: and yet, <hi>this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, reaſon, and ſenſe of yours</hi> muſt be harkned unto, before the truth of <hi>Gods Word,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>iudgement</hi> of all men, though never ſo judicious. Will any body that is wiſe truſt ſuch a judgement? If an excellent Phyſitian for others, is ſeldome found to be the beſt Phyſitian for himſelfe in a dangerous ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but will make uſe of one (it may be) inferiour in judgement in Phyſicke to himſelfe; for his owne wits be not ſo well his owne in his owne caſe; then me

thinkes, it ſhould be your wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to make uſe of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others, and not follow your owne ſenſe.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, ſhall I thinke otherwiſe of my ſelfe than I<note place="margin">Reply.</note> feele?</p>
               <p>I anſwer; I, in ſome caſes, or<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> elſe you will bee counted a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full foole, as in the caſe of an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,</hi> you feele your drinke to be of an odde relliſh; before you had your <hi>ague,</hi> you knew it was well relliſhed, and thoſe which bring it, tell you it is the ſame, ſtanders by taſte it for you, and ſay it is the ſame, and that it is excellently well reliſhed, I hope you are wiſer in ſuch a caſe as this, then to conclude according to your feeling, and taſte; every one ſeeth that the fault was in your palate, not in the drinke.
