            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

were to enioy a great, and rich Ioynture, of a thouſand, or two thouſand pounds yearely; would you not be deſirous, that beſydes the common Courſe of making Ioyntures (which perhaps might be ſubiect to ſome danger) to take (by your learned Counſell) the beſt meanes for the ratifying and better ſecuring of your Right to your ſaid Ioynture?

            <p>You all pretend Title to the kingdome of Heauen; a kingdom infinitly ſurpaſſing in worth, all worldly Iointures that the whole Earth can affoard; and will you then content your ſelues to ſeeke by the common, and ordinary Courſe of a <hi>Secular lyfe,</hi> to obtaine this kingdome (in which ſtate, as I grant, many liuing haue gayned it, ſo inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parably far many more haue loſt it;) but that rather you

            <p>This Treatiſe I haue compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in forme of a feigned <hi>Dialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,</hi> as hoping that thereby you will be ſooner induced to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and peruſing it at full; then if it were written in one long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſpeach, without any viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitude, or change of Perſons.</p>

the Argument, or ſubiect hereof next following.</p>
            <p>And ſeing the chiefeſt barre, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And firſt, whereas <hi>Lyfe</hi> is the deareſt thing to man or woman; yet we find, that beſides the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine great paines of Child-birth, <hi>Lyfe</hi> it ſelfe in young married wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, is for the moſt part, euery one, or two yeares greatly endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered to be loſt: witneſſe heereof is the daily experience of women dying in Childbed.</p>

            <p>Yf any one of you had a <hi>Iewels</hi> ſet with rich and Orient pearle, valewed at ſome hundreds of pounds, how carefull would you be in keeping of it? &amp; how would your care be doubled from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering the loſſe of it, at any tyme? And yet only for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying of a litle momentary plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (attended after with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of miſeries) you can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſo often to hazard the loſſe of your <hi>owne lyfe,</hi> the moſt precious Iewell, that God &amp; Nature hath beſtowed vpon you in this world. O fondnes of Iudgment!</p>
            <p>But to proceed. Admit, that a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45957:5"/>
woman in bringing forth her Children, should be freed from all danger of death; yet to how many other inſupportable affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions doth she become thrall, &amp; lye open? For we obſerue (and this not ſeldome) that the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band becomes vnkind, withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his loue and affection, from whence it is due, &amp; placing it on others where it is not due. Againe, the Husband (I meane, no few number of them) doth oftentimes diſſipate and waſte his Eſtate and Patrimony in ſenſuality and riot, to the vtter ouerthrow or begga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (in the end) of Himſelfe, his Wyfe, and Children.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe, the Husband be exempt from theſe diſorders; yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

all liberty and diſſolution, to the inconſolable griefe of the poore Gentlewoman their Mother, &amp; to the eternall Damnation of the Childrens ſoules?

            <head>The Argument, or Subiect of the enſuing Dialogue.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ORthodoxus,</hi> an imaginary Catholike Knight in <hi>England,</hi> and of a great State, hath three Children by his Lady <hi>Gynecia;</hi> two Daughters, &amp; one Sonne: The elder daughter is called <hi>Caelia;</hi> the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>Coſmophila;</hi> His ſonne <hi>Monadelphus. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> is permitted with conſent of her parents, to become <hi>Religious,</hi> and accordingly is ſent ouer vnto an Engliſh Monaſtery of Nunnes, in <hi>Belgiopolis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whiles ſhe is in her <hi>Nouiship;</hi> or yeare of <hi>Probation,</hi> her Brother <hi>Monadelphus</hi> dyeth. Hereupon <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> writeth to <hi>Caelia</hi> (ſince as yet ſhe was not profeſſed) to returne backe, becauſe (for want of Heyres-Male) he was determined to diſpoſe of both his daughters in Mariage, and to deuide (after his death) his State betweene them.</p>
            <p>He receaueth no anſwere from <hi>Calia.</hi> In the end, <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> is forced to ſend his yonger daughter <hi>Coſmophila</hi> to <hi>Caelia,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her returne. <hi>Coſmophila,</hi> as being fully inſtructed by her Father, (who furniſhed her with diuers Obiections, commonly made againſt a <hi>Religious lyfe)</hi> was moſt earneſt with her <hi>Sister</hi> to ſatisfy their parents deſire; and this in the preſence of the <hi>Confeſſarius,</hi> and <hi>Abbeſſe</hi> of that Monaſtery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caelia</hi> remayneth conſtant and immouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in her pious Reſolution. The <hi>Confeſſarius</hi> learnedly diſplayeth the weakenes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of all thoſe Reaſons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which <hi>Coſmophila</hi> brought. That done, he beginneth to diſcourſe in a moſt full man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:45957:9"/>
of the Dignity, Worth, Excellency, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges, &amp; Benefits of a <hi>Monasticall Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Speaches, by little and little, did ſo ſtrongly worke with <hi>Coſmophila,</hi> as that ſhe fully repenting her of former perſwaſions to her <hi>Sister,</hi> wholy altereth her iudgment; is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to lead the ſame Religious life with <hi>Caelia;</hi> taketh the <hi>Habit</hi> of the Monaſtery; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth her <hi>Nouiship,</hi> and changeth her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer name into <hi>Christophila.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two daughters wryte a ioynt letter to their parents, acquainting them with what hath fallen out. They withal intreat the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſarius</hi> to wryte (with theirs) his owne letter to <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> and his <hi>Lady.</hi> He agreeth to their requeſt.</p>
            <p>Their parents receauing theſe Letters, were at the firſt much agrieued. But within ſome ſmall tyme after, partly by force of the ſaid Letters, but chiefly ſeeing they ſaw it was Gods will and Ordination, that their only ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne ſhould dye; both their daughters ſhould become Religious; &amp; that they ſhold (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hopeleſſe of more iſſue) leaue no Heyres. Male of their owne bodies behind them, they humbly ſubmit themſelues to Gods good pleaſure therein.</p>
            <p>They do ſo repentingly acknowledg their former Errour in dehorting of <hi>Caelia,</hi> as that both being wel ſtroke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in yeares, they reſolue for ſatisfaction of that fault, to liue no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger togeather as man and wyfe; but to ſpend the reſt of their life in a <hi>Religious Courſe.</hi> Hereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> acquainteth the <hi>Confeſſarius</hi> by Letter, that he intendeth to enter into ſome Religious <hi>Houſe</hi> of the <hi>Capuchins;</hi> and <hi>Gynecia</hi> into the <hi>Monastery,</hi> where her two daughters do remaine.</p>

Now touching the buſines, this it is: Take notice, that, as I haue abous tould you, our only <hi>Brother</hi> is dead; In regard hereof my <hi>Father</hi> hearing, that as yet you haue not made any Vow of a Religious lyfe, nor yet in conſcience ſtand obliged to any ſuch ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall courſe, you being only in your <hi>Nouice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;</hi> He is deſirous therefore, that you returne preſently into <hi>England</hi> with me; for his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is (through want of heyres-Male,) to deuyde his liuing betweene vs, which, to ſpeake ſparingly, is two thouſand pounds yearely; himſelfe as you know well, being a knight (if ſo I may deliuer it with modeſty) of good place and ranke. He wrote to you ſome moneths ſince about this buſines, but it ſeemes his letters did miſcarry; and therefore he was the more willing to ſend me vnto you, to perſuade you to ſatisfy herein his iuſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45957:12"/>
deſire: Therefore ſeeing we are <hi>Sisters</hi> in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I hope you will beare to my ſpeaches a Siſterly, and liſting eare. And ſince you are the elder Siſter, my Father commanded me to tell you, that vpon your mariage, he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath to you at his death the better part, or moity of his ſtate and liuing. This is the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of my meſſage, and it is warranted with ſuch ſtrong Reaſons and Motiues, as that I cannot be perſuaded, but that you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme your ſelfe to our Father herein with all promptitude and readines of Reſolution; and that you will within few dayes prepare your ſelfe for your returne with me into <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>O deare Siſter, you could not haue brought me a more diſtaſtfull and vnpleaſing meſſage, then this: I am moſt ſorry that our Brother is dead (and yet we all muſt once dye,) but that his death ſhould be the occaſion of my forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my intended (and now entred into) courſe of life.

               <p>It is a lamentable thing to obſerue, how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy men are to detort the ſacred word of God, for patronizing of their owne puſillanimity and weakenes, in going forward in Chriſts ſeruice. True it is, that Gods holy writ doth in the former words premoniſh the pious to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Temptations; But withall we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that the Scripture doth not counſell vs to auoyde and decline a more holy lyfe, by reaſon of theſe Temptations; but fore warneth vs to be ready, and expect in reſiſting of the ſaid Temptations, with the weapons aboue
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45957:19"/>
named; to wit, <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Trembling</hi> The ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of this world do not for any feare for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to fight in their Princes behalfe, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeke to encounter their Enemy: Shall then a Soule thirſting after its owne ſaluation, forbeare the beſt meanes of obtayning it, for feare of the Temptations, which the ſpirituall Enemy (the deuill I meane) ſhall ſuggeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it?</p>
               <p>To proceed further: Certaine it is, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men liuing in the world, are more thrall to Temptations, then Religious women. For ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons lye open to euery bayte, and temptation, which either the deuill, or the outward ſenſes preſent vnto them; they euer conuerſing, and traficking (as it were) in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and worldly affayres. Now, Religious women are freed from all outward occaſions, and allurements of Temptations: Since there is a continuall watch, and ward kept ouer them. For their outward Senſes (as their eares, and eyes, and the reſt) are barred and reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from all ſuch dangerous obiects, as may occaſion temptation. Againe, their Inſtitution, Orders of their Houſe, Obedience to their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours; yea the very wals themſelues within which they are incloſed do guard them from all ſuch dangerous and ſpirituall incurſions. And which is infinitly more then all this, God hath obliged himſelf to miniſter meanes, (and principally his grace) to his Seruants for ouercomming all Temptations, ſuffered for his ſake: for theſe are the Apoſtles moſt cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full words: <note n="p" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>God is faythfull, who will not ſuffer</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:45957:19"/>
                  <hi>you to be tempted aboue that, which you are able: but will make alſo with the temptation, a way to eſcape, that you may be able to ſuſtayne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I grant, it cannot be denied, but that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons ſeeme in a vulgar eye to ſuffer more Temptations, then the Laity doth. And the reaſon hereof is this: Religious perſons, when they are once reſolued to liue a pious &amp; retired lyfe, do inſtantly begin to caſt their eye back vpon their former leſſe vertuous Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and thereupon to ſee (ſo far as liberty is granted them) in what ſtate their Soules ſtand in Gods ſight, with intention to better their former careleſſe proceedings. Now our ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enemy not brooking this, as loath to looſe that hold and intereſt, which he had in them, doth by all meanes caſt before them tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning a vertuous lyfe, therby more eaſely to withdraw them from proſecuting of the ſame. But to ſuch of the Laity, as conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the thraldome of the deuill, by their bad and impious liues, the deuill ſeemes to ſleepe, (I meane) ſo long as they continue vnder his power and command, and this with good ſhew of Reaſon: For he houlds it better poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to let them ſleepe in their ſinnes without affrighting them with any fearefull Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then to diſquiet them with ſuch ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, they being allready in his power.</p>
               <p>I will end this point of Temptations, vrged to fall out in a religious lyfe; whether theſe temptations haue reference to auſterity in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as to <hi>Obedience, Chaſtity, Pouerty;</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther otherwiſe the temptation concerne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45957:20"/>
either the Body or the Soule; And I will only ſay, that of my owne experience I haue knowne many young Engliſh Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women of very nyce Education, of weake conſtitution of body, and moſt deare to their parents, hauing once entred into a Religious and votary lyfe, haue moſt wonderfully ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all ſuch temptations; euen betrampling vnder their feete all the ſtratagemes that the Deuill, the fleſh, and the World could caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them (as ſtumbling blocks) to hinder their allready vndertaken Courſe of vertue. But what was the Cauſe hereof? To wit, the hope of eternall Felicity, and becauſe they diſclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from their owne forces herein, &amp; relied vpon Gods goodnes and prouidence, for the ouercoming of their temptations, and ſo very<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying in themſelues thoſe words of Chriſt: <hi>Sufficit</hi>

                  <hi>tibi gratia mea; my grace and aſsistance is ſufficient to giue thee victory, ouer all thy Enemyes.</hi> And why then may not our <hi>Sister Caelia</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue in her Monaſticall lyfe, the like fauours and indulgence from God, which he daily imparteth to others? O let not any exclude themſelues from receauing the ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, the which he, with ſo large and bountifull a hand communicateth to thoſe, who endeauour to ſerue him in all purity of Soule and Body.</p>

               <p>I grant, I cannot deny but that there are diuers Gentlewomen heretofore of my owne

familiar acquaintance, who haue entred into Religion; whoſe tendernes of body and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of breeding (I thought) could neuer haue brooked the daily auſterities therein vſed. And therefore to confeſſe my priuate iudgment herein, I haue beene forced to aſcribe this their ioyfull perſeuerance to Gods peculiar care, &amp; goodnes towards them.</p>
               <p>But to goe forward in this our diſcourſe: My Father would thus reaſon: The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God are inuiolable, and not diſpenſable: But one of the <hi>Ten Commandements,</hi> giuen to his people is: <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exo.</hi> 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt not kill.</hi> Well then, thus would he diſpute: Yt we be commanded by God not to kill one another; much more are we commanded not to kill our ſelues, ſince true it is, that a Homicide, who depriueth another man of his lyfe, is moſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull in the ſight of God; how execrable then is he in Gods Eye, who becommeth his owne butcher? But many ſuch perſons there are (ſaid he) who through entring into a moſt ſtrict &amp; ſeuere order of a votary lyfe, do often by their great faſtings, little ſleepe, immoderate diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines, and by other vnaccuſtomed rigidnes (if not immediatly kill, yet at leaſt) ſhorten their owne dayes, and draw the period of their life, to a far narrower compaſſe, and number of yeares, then God otherwiſe hath ordained to them. Thus good Syr you ſee, that it may be auerred (at leaſt with ſome ſhew of probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) that a Religious lyfe (ſo much aduanced by you, and entertayned by my <hi>Siſter)</hi> may ſeeme to be prohibited, &amp; forbidden by Gods owne hand-wryting.</p>

               <p>O how wanton and bold is Mans Nature to wreſt and miſconſter Gods holy word, for the impugning of that courſe of life, which God himſelfe firſt inſtituted! For how can it be, that the ten Commandements giuen by God to the Iewes, ſhould forbid that ſtate of life, which God after ordayned among the Iewes? But here I muſt make bold to charge your Father with want of reading: For it ſeemes he is ignorant, that among the Iewes (Gods choſen people) there were certaine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men, called <hi>Eſſenes,</hi> of whom <hi>Ioſephus</hi> (the learned Iew) thus diſcourſeth: <note n="q" place="margin">

                  <hi>The righteouſnes of the Eſſenes is meruaylous; They enioy their riches in common; and in this courſe, aboue foure thouſand men do liue, hauing neither wyues, nor ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</hi> And further of them in another place: <hi>They are Iewes by Nature,</hi> 
                  <note n="r" place="margin">
                     <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph. l</hi> 2. <hi>de bello Iudaic. c.</hi> 7.</note> 
                  <hi>and do obſerue Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, auoyde Mariage, are Comemners of riches.</hi> With whom accordeth the learned <hi>Philo.</hi> a <hi>Iew,</hi> 
                  <note n="s" place="margin">Philo de vita Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiua.</note> who ſpeaks much of the ſame <hi>Eſſenes,</hi> of their Monaſteries, and of their wonderfull faſting from Meate, ſaying of them: <hi>Vix ſemel triduo cibi recordantur: They ſcarce tast once of meate in the compaſse of three dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to anſwere this your Fathers Reaſon more particularly; Firſt I ſay, that worldly people (who are not reprehended for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) do vndertake as great, or greater ſeueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties euen for temporall reſpects, as religious women do for the gayning of Heauen. How
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45957:21"/>
many Tradeſmen are there, who watch moſt part of the night in labour, and ſpare dyet, for getting of meanes to maintaine themſelues &amp; their charge, with poore meate and meane cloathes? How many Saylers &amp; ſeamen, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with cold, thunder, and ſtormes, ſpend fewer howers in ſleepe, then Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do, and all for a little droſſe and gaine? Briefly, how many <hi>Lawyers</hi> are there in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> who liuing far from <hi>London,</hi> do conſume a good part of the yeare only in traueling vp and downe from their owne houſes to the <hi>Terme,</hi> not regarding (like to ordinary Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) any weather or foulenes of the way whatſoeuer? And when they come to the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</hi> all the forenoone they beſtow in going to <hi>Westminster.</hi> pleading (it is to be feared) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes an vniuſt cauſe: and all the afternoone they do ſhut themſelues vp in a little cloſet, for their Clyents to reſort vnto them; which ſitting courſe for ſo many howers would be moſt paynefull to other men: and all this vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſallage they vndergoe, for ſcraping together a little gold and ſiluer.</p>
               <p>Yf then temporall men forbeare not ſuch infinite drudgery, which in a common eye may ſeeme to ſhorten their dayes, and yet they are not to be charged for haſtening of their death; why then ſhall Religious women for vndertaking leſſer auſterities for Gods ſake &amp; deſire of gayning of Heauen, be reputed <hi>Killers</hi> of <hi>themſelues,</hi> or guilty of their death? In this laſt place I ſay, that it is experimentally moſt certaine, that worldly men, who liue in all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluency,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45957:22"/>
and aboundance of riches and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, do commonly liue fewer yeares, then Religious perſons do. For ſuch temporall men through Epicuriſme, and delicacy of fare, or through intemperance in the ſinnes of the fleſh, do fill their bodies with crudities, raw humors, &amp; diuers diſeaſes attending the ſame, whereby their liues are ſometimes ſhortned: Whereas Religious perſons, through their ſpare dyet, moderate labour, and daily medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Heauenly matters, haue produced their liues to many yeares. According hereto (to inſiſt in two or three particulars) we read, that <hi>S. Antony</hi> (the Hermit) liued a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fiue yeares, <hi>S. Ierome</hi> who ſpent much of his tyme in the wildernes, liued a hundred yeares; and <hi>S. Romualdus</hi> alſo arriued to more then to a hundred yeares. So litle Reaſon there is, to charge a Religious courſe, with ſhortening the lyues of its Profeſſours.</p>

               <p>I pray you, <hi>Father Confoſſarius,</hi> and you <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mophila,</hi> giue me leaue to vrge one reaſon (as more fitting to be deliuered by a woman) to proue, that religious women are leſſe ſubiect to ſhorten their liues, then other women who liue in the world; and this is <hi>Childbirth.</hi> How many women are there in the world (though otherwiſe of moſt ſtrong, and healthfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Body) who haue in the compaſſe of a day, or two in the deliuerance of their children, loſt their liues? This point is ſo cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45957:22"/>
and daily ſubiect to our hearing, that it were-loſt labour to ſpend more words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Now, Religious women, who euer remaine ſhut vp in their Monaſteries from the ſight of men, are thereby exempted from this danger, by the which Lay-women do oftentimes come to a ſudden and vnexpected death: and it may be perhaps your fortune <hi>(Coſmophila)</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your marriage to ſhorten your lyfe by this meanes; wheras it is impoſſible, that your Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Caelia,</hi> continuing in her preſent Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould thereby abbridge her dayes.

               <p>I partly acknowledg the weakenes of this my obiected Reaſon, for I diſcouer it for ſuch, through the ſeuerall anſweres aboue giuen thereto. But to proſecute my Fathers diſcourſe of the former Subiect: He (more then once) would ſay, that one by imbracing a votary or Monaſticall life, doth thereupon euen ſhake hands with the world, giuing it, its laſt <hi>Adieu;</hi> ſince he depriueth himſelf of all the pleaſures, which the world affords. And thus ſuch a man or woman ceaſeth to be themſelues, forbearing the ends for which in ſome ſort they were created. For they diſclayme from all Riches, Honours, Marriage, corporall pleaſures, and other conſolations, and comforts whatſoeuer, which the world daily affoardeth to others.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45957:23"/>
And this indeed I hould to be the greateſt hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of all others, for entring into that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired courſe of life, whereunto you <hi>(Reuerend Syr)</hi> do ſo much perſuade.</p>

               <p>I am of your mynd <hi>(Coſmophila)</hi> that this is the mayneſt obſtacle of all others in this kind; yet I thinke it may be remoued &amp; taken away with as much facility (or more) then any other of your obiected Reaſons. And firſt, I diſcouer the weakenes thereof, by laying downe the frequent Teſtimonies of Gods holy Writ, which proclayme the <hi>world</hi> to be an vtter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to mans ſaluation; and therupon do moſt forcibly dehort men from the loue of the world, and from the pleaſures thereof. Now who is ſo careleſſe, or deſperate of his Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that will contract an inuiolable, or ſtraite entercourſe of friendſhip with his fatall &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Enemy?

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45957:23"/>
ſhould be litle preuayling with you, I will cloſe this point, with the ſacred words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe, thus ſpeaking to the Phariſyes, and Iewes: (a) <hi>You are of this world; I am not of this world;</hi> thus excluding himſelfe from the world, as a profeſſed Enemy thereof. Yea our <hi>Bleſſed Sauiour</hi> proceedeth in words further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>world,</hi> thus ſpeaking in his prayer to his heauenly Father: (b) <hi>I pray not for the world, but for thoſe, which thou haſt giuen me.</hi> O dreadfull exception! What ſhall become of thoſe perſons eternally both Soule and Body, for whom the Redeemer of the world will not vouchſafe to pray? Or what hope of their Saluation can there be? Therefore happy are thoſe, who du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their peregrination &amp; exile here, are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for the tyme to be in the <hi>world,</hi> yet are not of the <hi>world.</hi> But I will add to theſe former au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities this enſuing inference: Yf diuers moſt learned Phiſitians ſhould with ioynt conſent preſcribe to their patients, that ſuch &amp; ſuch meats they ſhould forbeare, as being maine enemyes, or poyſon to their Health; would not thoſe Patients, who ſhould contemne their preſcriptions heerein, and ſhould moſt earneſtly couet and ſeeke after ſuch prohibited meats, be thought to be inſenſible, ſtupid, and careleſſe of the weale, and good ſtate of their Body?

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45957:29"/>
my owne fleſh) for the relinquiſhing of my vndertaken Courſe: But through his Grace, which is neuer wanting to thoſe, who beg it with all humility and prayer, I moſt eaſely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer came it at laſt. I am more willing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the ſame, thereby that others (when the like occaſion may occurre) be not wholy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed at ſuch like Temptations. It was this: (which is in part before touched by my Siſter <hi>Coſmophila,</hi> and in part anſwered by <hi>Father Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſarius,</hi> yet here I will repeate it hauing byn for the tyme greatly afflicted therewith; and things of moment, may warrantably be itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or related oftner, then once.)</p>
               <p>Oftentimes I was aſſaulted by the Enemy, in my mind, that many things are ſo hard in Religion, that I much doubted, whether my body (through its former delicacy, and ſoftnes in education during my ſtay in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d) could euer brooke and endure all thoſe corporall mortifications &amp; auſterities, which are found in a Religious Life; <hi>as riſing in the night, fasting, and ſparenes of dyet, ſubmiſsion to be vnder another, ſilence at certaine tymes,</hi> and the like. But in the end (during the ſmall tyme I haue yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in this Monaſtery) I ouercame them all, and did find an extraordinary repoſe &amp; quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of my ſoule in the ſubduing of them; fully confeſſing in that behalfe, thoſe words of our Sauiour to be moſt true: <hi>In</hi>

                  <hi>your Patience you shall poſſeſſe your ſoules.</hi> And indeed when I came ſeriouſly to waigh thoſe ſuggeſted auſterities in the ballance of Reaſon; I did find moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable Reaſons, whereby our body
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45957:29"/>
might be moſt forcibly impelled to a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and willing bearing, and practiſing of them.</p>
               <p>And firſt, I was wont often to call to mind, what I had heard learned men to ſay; to wit, That though our fleſh affecteth liberty, and much cheriſhing, yet the Body euen as its firſt creation, was made to be ſubiect to the ſoule, and not the ſoule to the Body; and therefore we are to chaſtice our body, and to curbe all the inordinate motions thereof. And indeed ſeeing the Soule is to haue a true command &amp; Soueraignty ouer the body (and this by Gods ordination,) the maiſtring of the body in not yealding to the temptations thereof, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo difficult a matter, as is commonly feared by moſt, that haue a deſire to enter into a religious lyfe. And the reaſon hereof is, in regard of many forcible Motiues, which may much ſtrengthen the ſoule, to curbe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred deſires of the fleſh, and bring it into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection. And thoſe Motiues (among diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers here omitted) may be drawne; Firſt from the Loue which we beare to God; which Loue of God doth naturally take comfort in ſuffering hardnes, tribulation, or any aduerſe fortune, for Gods ſake. Againe, the <hi>example of Chriſt</hi> himſelfe ought to be a great Spur vnto vs, in this Conflict betweene the Spirit and the Body, who ſuffered ſo much for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: Why then is it not reaſonable for vs to follow his footeſteps, in a far lower de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſuffering?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as aboue is intimated, the <hi>Diuine</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:45957:30"/>
                  <hi>comforts</hi> and Heauenly Conſolations (with which God vſually viſiteth that ſoule, which couragiouſly wars with the body, for the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les owne good) greatly animate the ſoule to this battel; ſince theſe ſpirituall comforts (as hidden Manna) much allay the aſperities, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone for the conquering of the fleſh, and its pleaſurs. Againe, the <hi>Expectation of an eternall Reward</hi> and Crowne, which is infallibly after this life to be giuen to all ſuch, who bring the body into Obedience for the better ſeruing of God, makes all the voluntary labours of the body to ſeeme nothing. Laſtly, I may vrge, that the <hi>Feareof eternall damnation</hi> both of ſoule and body (which is incurred through the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull pleaſures, and cheriſhments of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,) ought infinitly to encourage vs, for not yealding our ſelfes, as thrall to all the pleaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of the body.

Therefore to conclude this point, euery one, who hath holy Inſpirations from God, for the imbracing of a Votary and religious lyfe, ought to caſt their Eyes vpon all thoſe, who are gone afore vs, and haue in far greater meaſure of mortification traced that courſe of lyfe, of which we heere ſpeake; I meane, they are to call to mind the religious lifes of <hi>S. Hilarion, S. Ierome, S. Benedict, S. Bernard, S. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> and many hundred more; all whoſe bodies were made of the ſame fleſh and bloud, of which our bodies are made; and yet moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly they ſubdued their bodies to the ſpirit. They in ſo doing did expect the ſame reward, which other religious perſons at this day do expect: They now enioy Heauen, and ſo may we hereafter by following (though in a far lower proportion) their auſterities of body ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue to the ſame Heauen. But to preſſe this point more particularly, as concerning our owne Sex, let vs remember thoſe bleſſed Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>Caecilia, Agnes, Agatha, Barbara, Dorothea, Catharina,</hi> and many more of former tymes, who not only reſiſted, through their inteme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and vowed virginity all the temptations and allurements of the fleſh; but alſo with moſt wounderfull conſtancy and fortitude, endured glorious Martyrdomes for the loue Chriſt, and ſauing of their owne ſoules.</p>
               <p>Therefore briefly, let ech of vs in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of our Auſterities take courage, and ſay with the Apoſtle: <hi>I</hi>

                  <hi>Good ſiſter,</hi> this your ſpirituall Reſolution in ouercomming your mortifications, is far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then I euer expected to haue found in you, at which I much ioy. But to turne my ſelfe to you (good <hi>Father Confeſſarius)</hi> I cannot deny, but that you haue greatly diſcouered the weaknes and inſufficiency of all my former obiected reaſons, againſt the imbracing of a retired and religious life; Yet ſeeing it is the honour and priuiledge of <hi>Truth,</hi> not only to be able to with ſtand and breake through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces rayſed againſt it, but withall to fortify and ſtrengthen it ſelfe with vnanſwerable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Reaſons, for the patronizing and warranting of it ſelfe: And further, ſeeing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things there are, which as they cannot be greatly impugned by Arguments; ſo they haue few, or no Arguments for their ſupporting (though I preſume; the warrantablenes of a Religious lyfe is not of this Nature) therefore I am to make bould both with you, and with <hi>the Reuerend Abbeſſe</hi> here preſent (for I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that her long gouerment &amp; experience in matters of this ſubiect do much enable her) that both of you would inſiſt in your future diſcourſes, in laying open the <hi>Dignity, Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, prooffes, priuiledges, Benefits</hi> (and other ſuch preuayling Circumſtances) of a Votary life, which may moſt forcibly conduce to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of the Reſolution of ſuch, as may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after vndergoe that ſpirituall Courſe: <hi>The</hi>

               <p>Both I, and (no doubt) the <hi>Lady Abbeſſe,</hi> will condeſcend to this your pious requeſt, ſince Charity bindeth as thereto: And for my ſelfe, I thinke it moſt expedient, ſomewhat to enlarge my ſpeach vpon thoſe three mayne points, which are Eſſentiall to a Religious lyfe; I meane, <hi>Chaſtity, Pouerty,</hi> and <hi>Obedience;</hi> to the which all Religious perſons are by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Vow obliged.</p>
               <p>Now the more fully to know the dignity of theſe three points, it will be fitting here to ſet downe the admonition of the Apoſtle <hi>Saint Iohn</hi> giuen to all Chriſtians; and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſhew what particular reuerence theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall diſtinct Vowes do beare to his ſaid Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition: Thus then that Apoſtle counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth: <hi>Loue</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">1: <hi>Joan.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>not the world, neither the things that are in the world; Yf any loue the world, the Charity of the Father is not in him; Becauſe all that is in the world is Concupiſcence of the flesh, and Concupiſcence of the eyes, and pryde of lyfe.</hi> Thus is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of this world deuided into theſe three parts, as it were into three diſtinct Prouinces.</p>
               <p>Now for the better vnfoulding and explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the true meaning of this paſſage of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, we are to vnderſtand that by the <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence of the flesh,</hi> the Apoſtle comprehendeth <hi>all ſenſuall pleaſures of the body,</hi> and other delights vſed in cheriſhing and pampering the fleſh,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45957:32"/>
wherby the fleſh may burſt out into any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull and ſinfull Actions; <hi>By the Concupiſcence of the Eyes,</hi> he meaneth all <hi>beauty, and brauery of Riches;</hi> By <hi>pride of lyfe,</hi> he ſignifieth the Vanity of <hi>Ambition,</hi> conſiſting in worldly honour &amp; Eſtimation. Theſe three then are the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Vanities of this life, I meane, <hi>Carnall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Couetouſnes, and Ambition;</hi> By which three, as by his ſtrongeſt Nets, the Deuill doth daily enſnare man y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore Chriſtians to his ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, &amp; to their Soules eternall perdition.</p>
               <p>But now obſerue how the malice and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome of theſe three moſt peſtilent diſeaſes, are cured by the vowes performed in a Religious life: Firſt then the Vow of perpetuall <hi>Chaſtity</hi> of body (with the performance of the preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions adioyned thereto) cureth the malady of the <hi>Concupiſcence of the flesh:</hi> The Vow of <hi>Pouerty</hi> deſtroyeth the diſeaſe of <hi>Concupiſcence of the Eyes,</hi> to wit, deſire of enioying riches, &amp; the vnquenchable thirſt of Auarice. Laſtly the <hi>Vow of Obedience</hi> cutteth away from the ſoule, <hi>all pryde of life;</hi> ſince he, or ſhe, who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubiect themſelues in all lawfull things to the direction of another, is fat from offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in vayne Glory, which the Apoſtle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue calleth, <hi>Pryde of lyfe.</hi> By this then we may ſee, how a Votary and religious lyfe (being truly performed and led) doth meete with all the mayne temptations of the Deuill; ouer comming them, and bearing them downe through the aſſiſtance of Gods Grace, which is neuer wanting to ſuch, as by due appointed meanes, do implore it at his hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:45957:32"/>

                  <hi>which wilbe rich do fall into temptations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſnares of Satan; and into many improfitable and hurtfull deſires, which do drowne them in euerlaſting diſtruction and perdition.</hi> So iuſt reaſon therefore had our <hi>Sauiour</hi> thus to conclude generally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt rich men: <note n="r" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th.</hi> 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Amen, I ſay vnto you becauſe a rich man shall hardly enter into the Kingdome of Heauen:</hi> O that <hi>rich men</hi> would ponder deeply theſe points. Here now we ſee the vanity and dangers of <hi>riches,</hi> which danger is wholy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by its contrary, that is, by <hi>voluntary Pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> through which a Religious perſon diſclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from hauing any wealth or ſubſtance in particular to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>This then being ſo, is not that religious woman moſt happy, who by her profeſſion of <hi>Pouerty,</hi> hath freed herſelfe from all thoſe ſpirituall dangers ſet downe in the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, whereunto the rich worldlings do ſtand thrall, and ſubiect? and in lieu thereof doth purchaſe to her diuers priuiledges and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall benefits, which riſe from her <hi>voluntary Pr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty,</hi> and a free relinquiſhing of all worldly wealth? Of which many priuiledges I will
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45957:34"/>
here recount ſome few: Firſt then <hi>Religious Po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerty</hi> taketh away pryde, and haughtines of mind, which commonly accompanieth <hi>Riches,</hi> and withall it taketh from vs the power of committing many liones, which are wrought by the occaſion of wealth; ſo forcing a man by a kind of neceſſity to liue well. Secondly <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Pouerty</hi> not only preuenteth in vs the perpetrating of many ſinnes; but withall it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth in the enioyers thereof diuers Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as Modeſty, Temperance, and Humility; which laſt Vertue hath a kind of affinity or neere enter courſe with <hi>Pouerty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third benefit of <hi>Religious Pouerty</hi> is, that it is of force to cancell &amp; blot cut the ſinnes of a mans whole former lyfe, ſo ſatisfying for them. And according hereto we find the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Eſay thus to ſpeake in the perſon of God: <note n="s" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 48.</note> 
                  <hi>Behould, I haue boyled thee throughly, but not as ſiluer; I haue choſen thee in the fornace of Pouerty,</hi> meaning hereby, that he hath ſo refyned and purged him through <hi>Pouerty,</hi> as that he deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to be choſen and loued. A fourth benefit of <hi>Pouerty</hi> (to pretermit all others) is, that it conformeth vs to <hi>Our Bleſſed Sauiour,</hi> who ſo loued Pouerty, as that he was not only who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depriued or all <hi>riches,</hi> but had <hi>not as much,</hi> as any place (as <note n="t" place="margin">

                  <hi>Luke</hi> recordeth) <hi>to repoſe his head.</hi> And accordingly hereto we find, that when <hi>Ieſus</hi> gaue authority to his Apoſtles to goe abroad into ſeuerall Countryes to preach the Goſpell, he commanded them (by reaſon of his loue to <hi>Spirituall Pouerty)</hi>

                  <hi>nor bread, nor money, neither haue two Coates,</hi> as we read in the ſame Euangeliſt. Now what Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian of iudgment, and carefull of his ſoule, will not highly prize that ſtate of lyfe, in which Chriſt (both God &amp; Man) did chooſe to himſelfe to liue, and which he moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully recommended to his owne beloued A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles?</p>
               <p>To come to the third and laſt worldly <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> ſet downe, which is <hi>Pryde of life;</hi> where, <hi>by Pryde of lyfe</hi> the Euangeliſt <note n="x" place="margin">1. <hi>Ioan.</hi> 1.</note> vnderſtandeth <hi>vayne glory,</hi> and deſire of worldly honour, and dignity. This vanity, being a ſpirituall and moſt dangerous impediment of ſeruing God, is taken away by the vow of a <hi>Voluntary Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> and ſubiection, practized in a religious <note place="margin">Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</note> lyfe; For whoſoeuer (Man or woman) doth moſt willingly vow to obey their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in all lawfull things; that perſon cannot (ſo long as he obſerueth his vow) fall into the danger of <hi>Pryde of life.</hi> This vanity of <hi>Vaine Glory,</hi> conſiſting in the words of other mens mouths paſſed vpon one, is (as the other two former points ſet downe by <hi>S.

               <p>Now the worth of this Vertue of <hi>Obedience</hi> is much celebrated in Gods ſacred word: For we read it to be preferred before Sacrifice, the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> thus ſaying thereof: <note n="b" place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is better then Sacrifice</hi> (which paſſage you <hi>Coſmophila</hi> could alledge aboue in a wrong ſenſe.) And theſe words <hi>S. Gregory</hi> thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth: <hi>Obedience</hi>

                     <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor. ibid. c.</hi> 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Obedience is the only vertue which plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all other vertues in the mind; and preſerueth them after they are once planted.</hi> The truth of which aſſertion is proued ſeuerall wayes: Firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the liberall offer of a mans ſelfe to God (which is made by the Vowe of <hi>Obedience)</hi> prouoketh God to be bountifull and liberall towards that man againe; For it is the peculiar goodnes and diſpoſition of God, neuer to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelfe to be ouercome in bounty and loue; therefore it followeth, that whoſoeuer giueth himſelfe by <hi>Obedience</hi> vnto God, (which is done, when a man reſigneth his will by vow of <hi>Obedience</hi> to thoſe, who are ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Gods place) he doubtleſly in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence thereof receaueth from God all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45957:35"/>
Graces, and finally God himſelfe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Obedience</hi> is ſaid to plant all other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in the mind, becauſe in the practiſe of <hi>Obedience,</hi> it followeth, that we muſt practize them all.</p>
               <p>Another fruite of <hi>Obedience</hi> is, that it doth ſubiect vs, and all our actions to the will and pleaſure of God, and this without any relucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or reſiſtance; but with ſuch perfection, as that they are wholy dependant of him, and guided or directed by him, Since what action ſoeuer the <hi>Obedient</hi> religious perſon doth, the ſame he doth for Gods ſake: Therefore in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proofe of the fruite and dignity of <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> I will conclude this point with the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony and words of the Bleſſed &amp; learned <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine,</hi> he thus writing thereof: <note n="e" place="margin">

               <p>But now, <hi>R. Father Confeſsarius,</hi> to turne my ſpeach againe to you: I would intreat you to enter into a further Ocean, or mayne Sea, in diſcouering the great <hi>Dignity and worth,</hi> euer attending vpon a Religious Courſe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Confeſſarius.</speaker>
               <p>I am as willing thereto, as you <hi>(Coſmophila)</hi> are; ſo fruitfully ſhould I eſteeme my ſpeaches to be beſtowed, if ſo they could be of force to draw you to acknowledg all that <hi>Honour and worth,</hi> which is found to be in a <hi>Religious life.</hi> Therefore in this place, I will ſhew that a <hi>Rell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious life</hi> is (as it were) a Compound made of the mixture of moſt other vertues. Now if this can be proued (as hereafter I will proue) how worthy, and how much is to be admired the ſtate of Religion? For ſeeing vertue is the only true wealth (as I may terme it) of a Chriſtian; it muſt neceſſarily follow, that who hath more vertue, is more ſpiritually rich. Well then to paſſe ouer (as aboue is both proued &amp; gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) that the three <hi>Vertues</hi> of <hi>Chaſtity, Pouerty,</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> doe eſſentially concurre to the true Profeſſion of <hi>Religion,</hi> I will deſcend to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues, euer accompanying that ſtate.</p>
               <p>And to begin with the three <hi>Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Vertues,</hi> as they are commonly called, I meane, <hi>Fayth, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> And firſt tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <note place="margin">Fayth.</note> 
                  <hi>Fayth,</hi> (the <hi>Baſis,</hi> or foundation of all
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45957:41"/>
Chriſtianity) moſt cleare it is, that a <hi>Religious ſtate</hi> cannot be without an aſſured and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Fayth. The reaſon whereof is this: That Man or Woman, who entereth into Religion, forſaketh all preſent and temporall benefits &amp; pleaſures: for benefits and pleaſures which are vnſeene, and future, and ſo future as that they are not to come, but after a long diſtance of tyme; this man, or woman relyeth herein only vpon the ſole promiſſe and Word of God: but this no man would do, but he that is fully perſuaded, that the future is much more certaine and aſſured, then that which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And this is the greateſt Act of <hi>Fayth,</hi> which a Chriſtian can performe.</p>
               <p>What ſhall we ſay of <hi>Hope? Hope</hi> conſiſteth in two points; Firſt and principally, in hoping <note place="margin">Hope.</note> for the glory of Heauen; which though it be to come, yet <hi>Religion</hi> giueth ſuch full pledges thereof; as that it cauſeth a man to vndergoe all difficulties whatſoeuer in a religious life, for his infallible <hi>Hope</hi> of the ſaid glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. The ſecond point wherein <hi>Hope</hi> reſteth, is to extend and ſtretch it ſelfe out to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary helps of this preſent lyfe: but this kind of <hi>Hope</hi> is moſt fully and actually practized in <hi>Religion;</hi> ſince what man is there, who repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth more confidence in the goodnes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God for his enioying of ſufficiency of neceſſaries in this lyfe, then a Religious man, who voluntarily depriueth himſelfe of all things, which afore he did enioy, or might haue need of; wholy caſting himſelfe (throgh a moſt erected <hi>Hope)</hi> into the hands of Gods
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45957:41"/>
goodnes, care and benignity, for his prouiſion or neceſſaries?</p>
               <p>To deſcend to <hi>Charity; Charity</hi> brancheth it <note place="margin">Charity.</note> ſelfe into three Parts; One extendeth it ſelfe towards <hi>God;</hi> the ſecond branch, to thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are of the ſame <hi>Inſtitute;</hi> the laſt to all men whatſoeuer. Now touching that <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> which is borne to <hi>God,</hi> this moſt crearely ſhineth in a religious life; ſince it is the only <hi>Charity</hi> which a man beareth to <hi>God,</hi> which forceth him to abandon the world, for the more ſtrict and ſeuere ſeruing of <hi>God;</hi> therefore the force of that <hi>Charity</hi> muſt be extraordinary great, which ſurpaſſeth all the loue, which we beare to our Patents, Brethren, Kindred, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and all worldly temporalities, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the loue to our ſelues; for how were it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that one ſhould abandon and forſake all theſe things for <hi>God,</hi> if he loued not <hi>God</hi> more then all things?</p>
               <p>Touching the ſecond branch of <hi>Charity</hi> we are to conceaue, that the ſtreames of <hi>Charity</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Neighbours, are deriued from the loue of <hi>God,</hi> as from its ſource and fountaine. And thus theſe ſtreames runne firſt towards them, whom <hi>God</hi> hath linked and tyed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one and the ſame Community, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of lyfe, who by reaſon of this proximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and nearenes, haue euer beene accuſtomed to call one another, by the ſweet and louing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome of <hi>Brethren.</hi> Now the ground, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon Religious people doe agree and vnite themſelues together, is neither neerenes in hloud, nor n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45957:42"/>
Loue, which is <hi>Charity;</hi> which <hi>Charity</hi> did firſt breed this ſtrict aſſociation, and after did maintaine and continue it; For without <hi>Charity</hi> it would inſtantly decay and vaniſh away.</p>
               <p>The third Branch of <hi>Charity</hi> (as I ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boue) extendeth it ſelfe to all men; For excep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting certaine Inſtitutes in a Religious lyfe, which haue reference wholy to Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all the reſt are ſo wholy bent to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uice of their Neighbours (eſpecially by daily prayers, offered vp for them) that all their Thoughts and Endeuours ſeeme to leane that way, and the Employment of euery religious family giueth ſufficient teſtimony hereof. Thus may a Religious perſon iuſtly ſay, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaid of himſelfe: <note n="o" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>We haue made our ſelues ſeruants to all men.</hi> Hitherto of the three ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and ſupernaturall Vertues of <hi>Fayth, Hope, and Charity.</hi> But to come to other Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and morall vertues.</p>
               <p>And to begin with <hi>Prudence,</hi> defined by <hi>S.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> 
                  <hi>Austin,</hi> to be the <hi>knowledge of what</hi>

                  <hi>we are to deſire and what we are to flie.</hi> But in what ſtate of lyfe doth <hi>Prudence</hi> more manifeſt and diſcouer it ſelfe, then in a <hi>Religious lyfe?</hi> Now from the definition of <hi>Prudence</hi> giuen aboue by <hi>S. Austin,</hi> it ineuitably followeth, that perfect <hi>Prudence</hi> cannot reſide or dwell in a ſinners ſoule. The reaſon hereof is, in that perfect <hi>Prudence</hi> is a Vertue, which conſidereth the true End of Man, and doth apply for the purchaſing of that End, vpright aduiſe, vpright iudgment, &amp; vpright Command. Now heered demand
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45957:42"/>
where is the true End of man better conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of, and better weighed, then in Religion, where we direct and deuote our ſelues wholy to <hi>God,</hi> and put our ſelues entirely vnder his Dominion, and power?</p>
               <p>To come to <hi>Iuſtice.</hi> Where doth this vertue <note place="margin">Iuſtice.</note> more reſplendently thyne, then in a <hi>Religious lyfe?</hi> ſince the Office of <hi>Iuſtice</hi> conſiſteth in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing euery one his owne, and chiefly to <hi>God</hi> that which belongeth to <hi>God.</hi> Now the ſtate of a religious life barreth a man from all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of fraud and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cite, as with-houlding that from another, which belongeth to him; And certainly a true Religious ſoule would not for a thouſand worlds do any Iniuſtice to another, but infinitly more willingly would rather brooke to ſuffer wrong, then to do wrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Temperance</hi> is alſo a morall vertue: whoſe <note place="margin">Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> office is to bridle and curbe the pleaſures of the Body, but eſpecially thoſe pleaſures, which conſiſt in the ſenſes of touching, and taſting; The firſt belongs to generation, the deſires whereof are in themſelues moſt violent and intemperate; and yet they are all ſuppreſſed, or rather extinguiſhed by the vow of perpetuall <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> and with cloſing ones ſelfe within a Monaſtery. The pleaſure of taſting appertaines to the ſuſtenance and maintenance of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by eating and drinking: but all exorbitant and ſuperfluous effects hereof, are taken away in <hi>religion;</hi> Since a religious life confineth it ſelfe within the limits of neceſſity, and pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; contenting it ſelfe with ſuch poore and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45957:43"/>
ſuſtenance, meate, and drinke, as is able to maintayne the Body in good and perfect Health, for the better ſeruing of <hi>God.</hi> Thus you ſee, how this Vertue of <hi>Temperance</hi> is practized in a religious Life.</p>
               <p>To come to the laſt Morall Vertue, which is <hi>Fortitude.</hi> This <hi>Fortitude,</hi> of which we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe <note place="margin">Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> in this place, reſteth not in fighting in the field with one; But (it being the ſtrength of the <hi>Iust,</hi> is practized in ſubduing the fleſh in contradicting a mans owne will, in quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the delights and pleaſures of this life, in contemning all that, which this world ſo much admireth, for the Hope of an eternall kingdome; briefly in ſleighting te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and in patient bearing of Aduerſity.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45957:44"/>
things, heere we are to know, that there are two kinds of <hi>Martyrdome.</hi> The one of the <hi>Body;</hi> the other of the <hi>Soule:</hi> That of the body is, when a Man or Woman looſe their liues and bloud in proteſtation and defence of the true fayth. The <hi>Martyrdome</hi> of the Soule or mind is, to dye to the world, and to all the pleaſures thereof; and ſuch a perſon may truly ſay with the Apoſtle: <note n="s" place="margin">

                  <hi>The world is crucifyed to me, and I to the world.</hi> And what perſons in the world do ſuffer a greater <hi>Martyrdome</hi> of the mind, then ſuch as are Religious; ſince they are <hi>dead</hi> euen to the pleaſures of the fleſh (I meane to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage) <hi>dead</hi> to Riches, <hi>dead</hi> to Dominion or rule; Finally <hi>dead</hi> to all the fading comforts &amp; conſolations, which the world promiſeth?</p>
               <p>Now for the iuſtifying of theſe two ſeuerall <hi>Martyrdomes,</hi> I will inſiſt in the authorities of two or three ancient Fathers. Heere then we find <hi>S Austin</hi> thus to admoniſh all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: <hi>Let vs</hi>

Austin. S. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is herein more cleare, thus teaching: <note n="u" place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>There be two kinds of Martyrdome; the one in mind the other both in mind and outward worke.</hi> We may adde hereto what <hi>S. Ierome</hi> ſpeaketh, to wit: <note n="x" place="margin">

                  <hi>Not only the shedding of bloud is to be accounted Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome but the vnſpotted behauiour of a deuout mynd, is a daily Martyrdome.</hi> So far <hi>S. Ierome.</hi>

                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:45957:44"/>
Now to compare a <hi>Religious life,</hi> with <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome</hi> of the body. It is then to be obſerued, that as in many things <hi>Martyrdome</hi> ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a <hi>Religious life;</hi> ſo alſo a <hi>Religious life</hi> in ſome ſome things euen excelleth <hi>Martyrdome.</hi> To inſtance this <hi>Martyrdome</hi> of the body ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a <hi>Religious life,</hi> in that it vndergoeth far greater paines and torments; yet the greater the torments are, they muſt therein be the ſhorter, and ſooner bring the tormented party to Heauen. But in <hi>Religion,</hi> though the paines be not ſo violent, yet they are of greater and longer endurance. Againe, <hi>Martyrdome</hi> is to be preferred, in that by meanes thereof a man layeth downe his owne life; which is the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt pledge, that one can performe for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>Religion,</hi> though wanting this glory yet it hath the continuance of a moſt holy life, and ſtore of merits, &amp; this for many yeares, which doth aduance a man very highly in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the diuine Maieſty, and reward him with many degrees of glory and eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines in the Heauenly <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hereto, we may ſately affirme, that many yeares ſpent in holy conuerſation and retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of life, wil be attended with a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Reward, then the looſing of ones life, by only one ſhort Act of Martyrdome, ſhall procure.</p>
               <p>Now this Aduantage <hi>Religion</hi> hath aboue <hi>Martyrdome:</hi> To wit, that a <hi>Religious Courſe</hi> is a more ſafe way to gayne Heauen, then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation thereof by <hi>Martyrdome.</hi> And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereof is; in that many Chriſtians at the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45957:45"/>
tyme, when they ſhould ſuffer Martyrdome for the profeſſion of their Religion, haue ſhamefully falne from their fayth for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding of their torments. And this is euident out of the writings of <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> 
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, ſerm de Lapſis.</note> who rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the miſerable falles of ſeuerall hundreds, <hi>who</hi> (as he ſayth) <hi>were ouercome before the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and ouerthrowne before the encounter.</hi> Now <hi>Religion</hi> lyeth not open to this danger, ſince a <hi>Religious life</hi> more ſorreth to a mans diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then <hi>Martyrdome</hi> doth; and there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in it, which (as aboue is ſhewed) aſſwage the hardnes of that Courſe.</p>
               <p>Another priuiledge, which a true <hi>Religious</hi> life hath aboue <hi>Martyrdome</hi> is, that where as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is euer at hand, and ready to be imbraced at all tymes; <hi>Martyrdome</hi> ſeldome happeneth: ſince <hi>Martyrdome</hi> is not in our power; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought we to kill our ſelues, nor to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke others to kill vs; for either of theſe were an Act of great preſumption, and moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to God. Now I will conclude the reſemblance betweene <hi>Martyrdome</hi> and a <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious life,</hi> with this enſuing obſeruation: That as without death there is no <hi>Martyrdome</hi> of the body; ſo a <hi>Religious life</hi> may be ſaid to ſuffer a certaine kind <hi>of death:</hi> For ſeeing death depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs of our wealth of our friends and of all manner of things in this world; we in like manner find, that a <hi>Religious Cauſe</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue a man of all the ſame things; and this ſo wholy, that a Religious man can no more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy theſe things, then if he were truly &amp; really dead. Yet here is a diſparity, which maketh in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45957:45"/>
behalfe of <hi>Religion:</hi> which is, that when by <hi>Martyrdome</hi> we dye our bodily death, it is an eaſy matter to want all theſe worldly things; becauſe we then going to a better lyfe, ſhall haue no need of them; whereas ſeeing in this life we haue need of them, we forbeare the fruition and enioying of them, with greater difficulty and reſiſtance of Nature. Therefore impaſſe no further in this ſubiect, I conclude (in reſpect of all that aboue ſaid) that <hi>by Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man dyet to his Body; by Religion he dyeth to himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heere now <hi>(Coſmophila)</hi> you may behold the <hi>ſplendour</hi> and <hi>worth</hi> of a <hi>Religious life,</hi> which, as it is ſurpaſſed in ſome reſpects by <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> ſo in others it exceedeth it; I ſay, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> the ſuffering whereof euen our <hi>Sauiour</hi> himſelfe ſo much celebrateth in theſe words: <hi>Greater</hi>

               <p>Well then to come to that point. I did then ſay nothing, but what I will proue at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And firſt in warrant of that my Aſſertion that Religious perſons are a continuall <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> to God, in reſpect of the oblation, which they make of themſelues to God. I do produce S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> thus teaching: <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>A man conſecrated &amp; vowed to the Honour of God, is a Sacrifice, in regard that he dyeth to the world, that he may liue to God. When we chastice our body by temperance, if we do it for God (as we ought to do) to the end not to yeald our members weapons of Iniquity, but weapons of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice to God it is a ſacrifice. Yf therefore our body, which is but as it were) a ſeruant and instrument of our ſoule, be a ſacrifice; if the good and pious vſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he directed to God; How much more then shall a ſoule be a Sacrifice, when it deuoteth it ſelfe to God to the end that being inflamed with the fyre of his loue, it may deſtroy in it ſelfe the forme and impreſsion of all worldly Concupiſcence, and be reformed according to his vnchangeable likenes ſubiect vnto him; and this Sacrifice shall be ſo much the more gratefull, by how much it partaketh of his beauty?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far doth <hi>S. Auſtin</hi> diſcourſe of this point. With whom agreeth <hi>S. Gregory</hi> thus ſpeaking: <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>We offer our ſelfes in Sacrifice to God when we dedicate our lyfe to his diuine Seruice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus theſe Fathers; to whom I could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the like authorities of many other of them. And now from hence I may infer. That <hi>if it be a Sacrifice for vs to offer any thing vp to God</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:45957:46"/>
                  <hi>then doubtleſly to offer vp our ſelues to God, is truly a Sacrifice;</hi> the true Nature and eſſence whereof co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in the abſolute oblation of our ſelues (I meane of our bodies and ſoules, and of all the powers of our Soules, and particularly in offering vp the power of <hi>our will:)</hi> eſpecially in ſuch an oblation, as being once offered vp, it is not in our power to recall. Now, how moſt acceptable the ſacrifizing of our Soule &amp; body is to God; is proued by this reaſon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: Yf the Sacrifices of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> conſiſting in offering vp to God a Heiffer of three yeare old, or a Calfe, or ſome other ſuch beaſt, were ſo pleaſing to God, and that God did receaue thoſe Sacrifices (as the Scripture ſayth) <hi>in</hi>

                  </gap>e, which are euer attended on with hope of great benefit; and profit deriued from thence; Therefore to encourage that ſoule, which bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth an eye chiefly to its own benefit &amp; emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument, I ſhould be deſirous to know, what <hi>fruite</hi> may be reaped by profeſſing a <hi>Votary</hi> and <hi>Religious life,</hi> which by other vertuous courſes is not ſo eaſely obtained. We ſee how world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men are carried with an impetuous ſtreame of their Will, to ſuch profeſſions of life; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they hope to reap profit, thereby to quench their vnquencheable thirſt of gayne.

Therefore <hi>(Good Syr)</hi> inſiſt, I beſeech you, in this ſubiect; ſo far forth as you ſhall thinke good. I do aſſure you, I do bring with me

               <p>As aboue I ſaid, ſo now againe I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with, and ſatisfy your requeſts in what I can: and indeed there are ſo various and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers <hi>benefits</hi> flowing neceſſarily from a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and profeſſed life, as that I may ſay with the Poet: <hi>Inopem me copia fecit,</hi> Aboundance of matter makes me vncertaine where to begin. Therefore at this preſent I will reſt in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to your iudgment the chiefeſt <hi>fruits &amp; benefits</hi> deriued from a <hi>Religious life,</hi> pretermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for breuity others of leſſe moment.</p>
               <p>Firſt then we hould, that a man, or woman by entring into Religion, hath euen by the force and vertue of that Act (as men of rype age haue by their <hi>Baptiſme)</hi> a full remiſſion of all their ſinnes committed till then, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes.</note> their whole life. Now, how great, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe, and ſoueraigne a benefit is this? The greatnes whereof is beſt diſcerned by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the effects wrought thereby; to wit, Firſt, the auoyding of Hell-fyer for all Eternity, or the fyer of Purgatory, which is more inſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable (as <hi>S.

Secondly, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning of the kingdome of Heauen, which is reſerued and giuen only to thoſe, whoſe ſinnes are remitted and forgiuen. I will add hereto this one conſideration; That if we be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45957:48"/>
but only one mortall ſinne, how great paines ought we to take, in procuring a true Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trition therof, in afflicting our bodies with faſting, diſciplines, and other ſuch auſterities? how impreciable then, and moſt worthy to be eſteemed, is that Courſe of life wherein a man or woman entring into doth by that one Act, deface and cancell out, not one only ſinne, but all ſinnes and leſſer imperfections, which a ſinfull or careleſſe Chriſtian hath committed afore all his life tyme?</p>
               <p>Now that the Profeſſion of <hi>a Religious life,</hi> doth euen by vertue of that Act, blot out all ſinnes afore committed. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> (that great Doctour, and Saint) thus diſputeth: <hi>If</hi>

Religious life; the greatnes whereof who can truly apprehend? O if a Man by ſome traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and diſloyall Act to his Prince, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chayned, and were daily to ſuffer inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble torments for ſuch his Cryme: Or if one were infinitly indebted to his Creditours, and fat more then all his temporall ſtate were able to diſcharge, how happy would that firſt man, or this other thinke themſelues to be, if ſo the one could be ſet at liberty from his daily pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and the other diſcharged of all his debts, by performing <hi>one only Act,</hi> which ſhould be moſt gratefull to the Prince of the one, and to the Creditours of the other? The Caſe is here a like: We all by ſinne commit a ſpirituall treaſon towards God, and alſo by them, we daily increaſe the heape of our debts, that is, our Tranſgreſſions, for which we ſay in our Lords Prayer, <hi>Forgiue vs our treſpaſſes.</hi> And yet all the puniſhments due to be inflicted vpon vs, and all the debts we owe to God, may be taken away and diſcharged by one <hi>only Act</hi> of entring into Religion.

And thus briefly to proue, that the Act of firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a Religious life (if other requiſite circumſtances be not wanting) doth oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and blot out all ſinnes afore committed, and that, in that reſpect, it is iuſtly called, <hi>A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Baptiſme.</hi>

Yf a <hi>Religious life</hi> can procure a full remiſſion of all ſinnes, in reſpect of eternall damnation due to our ſinnes, as aboue I haue ſhewed, it
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45957:49"/>
doth; then much more a <hi>Religious life,</hi> is of force to procure the leſſe; that is, to cancell and blot out all temporall puniſhment: Since the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>Purgatory,</hi> are ſo much inferiour to euerlaſting damnation, as <hi>tyme</hi> is inferiour to all <hi>Eternity;</hi> and to endure torments for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine yeares only, is more ſufferable, then to endure torments for euer and without End. And the leſſe we are here to admire, that <hi>a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious life</hi> can take away all the paines of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> if ſo we call to mind, that this life is a ſtate or <hi>Pennance,</hi> and ſo commonly called, in regard that moſt of the tyme thereof is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed in bewayling and lamenting the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our life, and in repairing the faults and negligences of former yeares.</p>

               <p>In this place now I will deſcend to ſhew, that moſt holy Seruants of God haue been greatly afrayd of the paines of this <hi>purging</hi> fyre; Now if ſuch men of eminency for vertue and Piety, haue ſtood in ſuch feare and horrour thereof, what then ſhall become almoſt of all Lay-people, who liue in the world, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to take the Courſe of <hi>Religious life,</hi> which is very auayleable to preuent and free them from that raging fyre? I will then firſt ſet downe the words of <hi>S.

                  <hi>O Lord, rebuke me not in thy fury, nor correct me in thy wrath. This is</hi> (ſayth S.

                  <hi>damnation. But becauſe I eſteeme that purging fyre (though it be tranſitory) to be more intollerable, then all the tribulation, which in this lyfe may be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; Therefore I only do not deſire, not to be rebuked in the fury of eternall damnation, but alſo I greatly feare to be purged in the wrath of tranſitory Correction:</hi> Thus <hi>S.

               <p>Thus far <hi>(Coſmophila)</hi> of this ſubiect; And now from hence I preſent to your iudgment the conſideration of two points. Firſt, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent extremity of the paines of <hi>Purgatory;</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly; that the moſt holy men who haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, ſtood moſt fearefull, that their liues and Actions ſhould be tried, refyned &amp; purged in this fyre. Now both theſe two paſſages being
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45957:51"/>
moſt euident, (and aboue by me ſo cleared) what dread then may Lay-people (ſuch as your ſelfe <hi>Coſmophila</hi> is) conceaue of this fyre? Wherein all the Idle words (to apply my ſpeach particularly to your Sex) of yong Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-women, all heir amarous Conceites, and diſcourſes with men, all multitude of lighter ſinnes, all deſire of ſuperfluous brauery in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, and new faſhions, all idle ſpending of ſeuerall howers in the day for adorning and beautifying of their faces and bodies, to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on by men, ſhalbe purged? and for how many yeares God himſelfe only knoweth. Yf a man ſhould put his hand into the fyre, but for the ſpace of a quarter of an hower, what inſupportable paines ſhould he endure? Yet all this were but a flea-byting in regard of the torments of Purgatory, conunuing for many yeares. Now then to turne &amp; apply my ſpeach to the beginning of this mayne paſſage: <hi>Yf a Religious life</hi> be ſo worthy in it ſelfe, and of ſuch efficacy, (as being a ſtate of <hi>Continuall Penance)</hi> as that by it a Religious perſon may labour daily to cancell his ſinnes, and to eſcape the paines both of Hell, &amp; <hi>Purgatory;</hi> how weake then is the iudgment of all thoſe, who ſleight and prize litle the priuiledges granted by God to ſuch a life? And on the contrary ſyde how happy <hi>(Coſmophila)</hi> is your <hi>Sister Caelia,</hi> in chooſing this her retired and votary life, for her better auoiding of all the former threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned dangers?</p>

                  <hi>Reuerend Father Confeſſarius,</hi> and you <hi>Coſmophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> with both your good leaues, I will make bold to relate one <hi>Fruite</hi> or benefit of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious life, and hereto I am the more willing, in that out of my owne experience and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ouer others, I find the <hi>Fruit</hi> by me here vnderſtood, to be moſt exactly practized by <note place="margin">Lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of mind, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</note> all thoſe religious ſiſters, who liue vnder my charge.

Bernard.</hi> The truth whereof from experience appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; ſeeing we may daily obſerue, that that Man, or Woman, who is moſt poore in ſpirit (that is moſt humble) is commonly moſt rich in the guifts of the ſpirit; and according hereto (if ſo I remember the words) the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Dauid thus ſpeaketh: <hi>Our</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now for the further diſplaying of the great fruit of <hi>Humility,</hi> we may call to mind, that it preuenteth many dangers of the ſoule, vnto

which dangers high minded perſons lye open. <hi>Humility</hi> alſo miniſtreth many helpes to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Saluation; for they, that are in honour &amp; Elation of ſtate, are euer in great danger of a headlong falling; whereas <hi>a good humble Soule</hi> repoſeth it ſelfe moſt willingly in the loweſt place, and is thereby more remote from any ſpirituall ſlipping downe. And by this we may gather how much we are obliged to <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> whereby keeping vs out of the trafficke and commerſe of the eyes of men, and from all worldly aduancements, we reſt in a holy and wholeſome place of Refuge; we being by this meanes made meere ſtrangers to the World, and the World to vs.</p>
               <p>And touching the practiſe of this precious Vertue of <hi>Humility,</hi> (if I may ſpeake it in all ſobriety of iudgment,) it is moſt exactly and daily put in execution by the <hi>Siſters</hi> of this our poore Monaſtery.

ech one at his death, we dare ſay. That if there be any kind of men, that are not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at that tyme, or but very little with his wicked ſuggeſtions, the Religious Man is that man. And this is thus proued: Firſt, in that the goodnes of God, will not ſuffer himſelfe to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore no good <hi>Religious perſon</hi> hath iuſt Reaſon to feare, but that God at the hower of his death will couer him vnder the wings of his protection, and will ſtrengthen his Soule with internall comfort.</p>
               <p>To the leſſening or breaking of the forces of the former temptations of the Deuill, at the tyme of a <hi>Religious Mans</hi> death, we may add the comfort and conſolation, which euery Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man at that hower receaueth of his <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> &amp; euery Religious Woman of her <hi>Siſters.</hi> This I meane, by the aſſiſtance of their <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> and <hi>Siſters;</hi> which aſſiſtance conſiſteth in their exhortations, Counſell, and continuall prayers; which allwayes, but eſpecially at the

               <p>The firſt is, of a <hi>Yong Gentlewoman,</hi> to whom was left by her deceaſed Father (a man of a great eſtate, and of very good ranke) two thouſand and fiue hundred pounds for her portion: <hi>This Gentlewoman</hi> would oftentimes make great ouertures, and ſhewes of her de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſire to enter into a religious ſtate; and many holy inſpirations from God (no doubt) ſhe had thereto. But ſhe going vp to <hi>London</hi> out of her owne Country (whether to the end of taking that bleſſed courſe, or not, I certainly
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:45957:59"/>
know not) did fall in acquaintance with a yong Gentleman, far vndeſeruing her, or her eſtate or portion: Him ſhe maried, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſſe of a yeare had a Child by him, and both ſhe and the Child dyed in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and ſo he went freely away with her good portion.</p>
               <p>The other was <hi>a Gentlewoman,</hi> deſcended from a very honourable ſtemme. This <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman</hi> being maried, her firſt husband dyed, &amp; did leaue her a very fayre Iointure, Preſently vpon the death of her husband, nothing was with her ſo frequent in her ſpeaches, as a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery,</hi> with an abſolute Reſolution to enter into Religion. This <hi>Gentlewoman</hi> alſo (as the former) making a iourney to <hi>London</hi> (a fit place for Women to get bad Husbands) wrought meanes to a worthy Gentleman, (from whoſe mouth I heard it) that he would procure paſſage for her going ouer into the low-Countryes. Well, it ſo vnfortunately happened, that in the meane time ſhe grew acquainted with a yonger brother of good deſcent, but of moſt ſmall meanes, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of deſert. To conclude, to him ſhe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed herſelfe, and now at this preſent day they fiue parted with great diſcontent; he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing about the halfe of her yearely means al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutted to him, and ſhe the reſt; ſhe ſo liuing in no abundance, if not in want. O how happy thoſe <hi>two Gentlewomen</hi> had beene, if they had proſecuted their good deſires proceeding from God, with all promptitude of putting them in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45957:60"/>
They both then might haue ſpent many yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in a pious and Religious Courſe; furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring others in their Monaſtery (and therein their owne ſoules) with what was more then needfull to their owne maintenance.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Good Madame,</hi> and you <hi>Reuerend Father;</hi> who both perſuade me to returne into <hi>England,</hi> procuring my Parents conſent to this my late Vocation; heere I demand of you both: What greater ſecurity can I promiſe to my ſelfe, in perſeuering in this my intended courſe, then theſe two former <hi>Gentlewomen</hi> could? They had temptations of Mariage, ſo I may haue the ſame: They were ſubiect to the amarous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Loue, I cannot ſay, I am naturally free from it. In the end, they gaue the bridle to their affections, with leſſe benefit in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood to their owne Soules; <hi>O ſweet Ieſus</hi> giue me grace, that their examples may be a fore warning and document to me, <hi>that I may</hi>

thereby my Father and Mother might the more eaſely and diſpationatly apptehend the firſt report of both our ſettled Reſolutions.

And indeed, as concerning my ſelfe in particular, it ſeemes to me that you <hi>(Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend Syr)</hi> do in ſome ſort ſtand obliged to performe, what I here deſire. For ſince it is the force of your pious and vertuous diſcourſe which hath firſt wrought ſo much vpon my Soule, as to induce it (I hope irreuocably) to the vndergoing of a <hi>Religious life;</hi> that therefore you are euen in your owne reputation, bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to giue my Father by your letters full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for the warranting of this my choſen State.</p>

                  <p>Touching then this <hi>Subiect,</hi> I will deuide my whole future diſcourſe into three generall branches, or Heads.

In the third, and laſt place, I will proue by force of Reaſon, that parents ought to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reſigne their Wills, to Gods Will herein; I meane in ioyfully ſuffering their Children to be called by God, to this his ſo peculiar ſeruice.</p>

To begin with the firſt: And firſt, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that ſuch Parents do fight &amp; warre euen againſt Gods owne will and predetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: a warre moſt impious, and withall moſt exitious, and fatall to them that vndertake it.

And yet all thoſe <hi>Parents</hi> and others, who ſeeke to dehort their <hi>Children,</hi> or their friends from a <hi>Religious life</hi> (if ſo they were reſolued to vndergoe that holy Courſe) are intereſſed in all the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed Tranſgreſſions.</p>

                     <hi>VEry Reuerend Syr:</hi> It is now two Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, ſince I receaued yours, and my two <hi>Daughters</hi> Letters, as alſo your pious and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> which you vſed toward, my daughter <hi>Coſmophila.</hi> I was loath to returne any anſwere to you, or them preſently, or v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſuddaine, becauſe ſuch my anſwere might perhaps be preſumed to proceed from griefe, paſſion, and a violent entertayning (at the firſt ſight) the Occurrences ſpecifyed in thoſe Letters.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore <hi>Tour Reuerence</hi> may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice hereby, that I haue not only read, but euen ſtudied your whole <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> with your letters ſent vnto me; as alſo you may be aduertized hereby, that vpon my more retired, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate thoughts, I and my wyfe do great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledg our former errour, in ſhe wing any reluctation, or drawing backe of our daughter <hi>Caelia,</hi> from her already vndertaken life; or of our daughter <hi>Coſmophila</hi> from her entring into the ſaid Courſe. Your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſet downe in your writings (I grant) conuince me: Your authorities drawne from

                  <p>And to lay open my ſelfe more plainly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, I confeſſe, that ſince my firſt receauing of your letters. I haue peruſed ſome Authors treating of this particular ſubiect, controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

No: <hi>God</hi> hath choſen them both to himſelfe, and hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen but what afore was his owne: And ſhall a carnall Father, or Mother diſlike, or repine at ſuch a choyce? O <hi>God</hi> forbid! And truly beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the force of your Authorities in behalfe of <hi>Religious life</hi> (which, I grant, are ſtrong with me) I haue (as aboue I touched) lately peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed diuers others mayne Motiues, conducing to the proofe of the ſaid point, before by me impugned.</p>
                  <p>And firſt I find, that though <hi>Parents</hi> haue a certaine kind of authority ouer their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yet this authority is but delegated, or by deputation from <hi>God;</hi> as being but part of that

                  <p>I will infiſt in one only reaſon more, which is in part touched in your large <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> and indeed very much commandeth me. It is this That, which we receaue from our <hi>Parents</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>And as touching the making of the Body <hi>Man</hi> only affordeth a litle ſeminall matter thereto; but how this ſeminall matter ought to be framed with all its parts and lineaments the <hi>Parents</hi> know not, that being the worke of <hi>God,</hi> ordained in the firſt creation, or making of <hi>Man.</hi> Since then what we receaue from ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For Alas, Syr! What in true iudgment ſhould detayne vs from taking this Courſe? With three Children <hi>God</hi> hath bleſſed vs; One Sonne, and two Daughters, and they all dead (as I may ſay) in our owne life tyme. Our only Sonne, whome I hoped would haue been the Arch, as it were, &amp; ſtay of my Houſe, dyed naturally; Our two daughters are alſo dead vnto the world. Therefore I ſee hereby (my wife being paſt Childbirth) that it is <hi>Gods</hi> good pleaſure, that not any of my owne body ſhall inherit my temporall ſtate: His bleſſed will be done.</p>
                  <p>And ſince <hi>God</hi> is the ſole true Lord of the earth, and of all things therein, I willingly &amp; freely ſay with the <hi>Pſalmist: Domins</hi>

Though I could wiſh (and accordingly, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to diſpoſe, if ſo it may ſtand with his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Goodnes) that the halfe of my Lands be giuen to him, who is neareſt to me in kindred of my <hi>Owne Name</hi> (ſuch a ſtrong tye haue hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and naturall reſpects in vs) and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther halfe of my ſtate be to be <hi>ſould,</hi> and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to ſpirituall vſes, for the good of myne owne, my wyues, &amp; my two <hi>Daughters</hi> Soules.</p>
                  <p>This is all, that I can ſay, only (as aboue I haue fully deliuered my ſelfe) you may certify my two <hi>Daughters,</hi> how ioyfully I conceaue
