            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>

            <p>I Here send You the <hi>Account,</hi> which <hi>Monsieur de Sorbiere</hi> has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51287:4"/>
And though it be an insolent Libel on our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet I doubt not, but you will peruse it with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. For when you have beheld how many errors, and falshoods, he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in this small Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; you cannot but be well pleas'd to find, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever undertakes to defame your Country, he must at the same time, forfeit his Wit, and his Understanding, as well as his good Manners.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King of France</hi> ha<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Answer. And it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the justice of so great a Monarch, while he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Interest of the Christian Faith with his arms, to punish a pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Reviler of one of the most powerful Kingdoms in Christendome: and while he was exacting satisfaction from the <hi>Pope</hi> himself, for an affront offer'd to his <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador,</hi> to take care that none of his own Subjects should presume to injure the reputation of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and neerest Allies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:51287:5"/>This just Reply which has been publiquely made to this rude Satyr, was the cause that it has not bin hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto confuted by an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Gentleman</hi> of your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, who had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken it, whose Wit wee might have oppos'd against him, if he had still flourish't at <hi>Paris,</hi> with the Title of <hi>Historiographer Royal,</hi> though all his mighty boasts of his own abilities had been true. But however, though he is now below our excellent Friends consideration; yet
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51287:5"/>
I think my self ingag'd to see him corrected. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now under my hands the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Royal Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi> it will be in vain for mee to try to represent its design to be advantageous to the glory of <hi>England,</hi> if my Countrymen shall know that one who calls himself a member of that <hi>Assembly,</hi> has escap'd unanswer'd in the publique disgraces, which he has cast on our whole <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will therefore Sir, brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take him into a calm ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51287:6"/>
And that you may understand how I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to proceed with him, I do here in the beginning profess, that I will not vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the honor of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> by making reflexions on the <hi>French.</hi> I will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to repair our own fame on the ruines of others. I will have no contention but with himself. I will only put together, and compare, the mistakes, the incoheren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the vanities of his Book. And (to confess a secret to you, Sir,) I am resolv'd to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51287:6"/>
take this course in answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; not only because I abhor the sordid way of Wit, of abusing whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but also because I am not much inamor'd of the glory of his punishment. For I cannot think that it is worth a mans while, that can live quietly here at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to have the honour of making three or four ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd jests, on a whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with the hazard of being justly bani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ht into <hi>Flint</hi> or <hi>Denbigh</hi> for ones la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:51287:7"/>I must confess Sir, I came at first to read him with some expectations. I had before seen what he had written in praise of those two great Men, the Ornaments of <hi>France, Gassendus,</hi> and <hi>De Marcu the Arch-Bishop of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> And I had some good hope, that the familiarity, which he pretended to have had with them, had taught him some of their good Qualities: that from the first he had taken that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and modesty, which the world admires in his
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51287:7"/>
writings: and from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had learn'd with what respect he ought to treat the fame of whole <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Churches,</hi> and <hi>Soveraign Princes,</hi> by that admirable defence, which he has made of the <hi>Gallican</hi> priviledges. Besides this, Sir, I took his Book into my hands with the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er good-will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I had some knowledg of his person: I had seen him at the <hi>Royal Society</hi>: I had been a witness with what civility he had been there entertain'd: I had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51287:8"/>
what kindness he had receiv'd at <hi>Oxford</hi>: I had heard what favour the <hi>King</hi> had shewn him, by admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to private discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with him in his Cabinet. And from all this I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to beleive, that he had given an honourable, or at least a just description of <hi>England.</hi> But I quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd how much I was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed: I presently saw what difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween scribling fine Haran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues on vertuous Men, and real vertue it self. I strait

this peculiar good Quality, that they love to have themselves handled plainly, and ill-spoken of.</hi> This he professes <hi>to mention in our praise.</hi> And if this be his Courtesie, I now find, that the <hi>Passengers with him in the Waggon</hi> had reason, when (as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains) <hi>they interpreted his very Civilities for affronts.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 21.</note> But hold, Sir, what is this that he here says? has the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Nation</hi> ever caus'd its <hi>Character to be Printed</hi>? he speaks of it, as if it had been a thing done by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:51287:29"/>
and by the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the whole State. 'Tis true, Sir, there was (as you may perhaps remember) a small <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> that came out with the <hi>Title of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of England,</hi> about six years ago. But that was pretended to be a <hi>Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> out of <hi>French.</hi> Or let us suppose that it was an <hi>Englishman</hi> that writ it under that disguise: yet has <hi>Monsieur de Sorbiere</hi> from thence any ground to say, that <hi>the whole English Nation has often printed its own Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter?</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:51287:29"/>
I will give him one instance to shew how ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly he did thus conclude, from one particular man, to a whole Country. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur de Sorbiere,</hi> in his <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Letters,</hi> has inserted (as he calls it) <hi>a Sceptical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse concerning the City of Paris</hi>: wherein he uses the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of all <hi>France,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as injuriously, as he does the <hi>English</hi> in this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>; with language as foul, as the <hi>Dirt</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> it self. Now then, because <hi>Monsieur de Sorbiere,</hi> a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51287:30"/>
inhabitant of <hi>Paris,</hi> has presum'd to slander it, in that manner; does it become me to affirm <hi>that the whole City of Paris has written a scandalous Libel on it self?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps by this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance which I have here mention'd, <hi>Monsieur de Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biere</hi> will raise an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that shall be very much to his own advantage. For now he will be ready to say, that the <hi>English</hi> have no great reason to take his Affronts unkindly, seeing he has been already so free
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51287:30"/>
of his Corrections, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs, as not to spare his own <hi>Countrymen</hi> themselves. I accept of his <hi>Apology.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Pietatis plena Defensio</hi>: 'Tis an excellent good Natur'd Defence, for his rayling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Strangers,</hi> that he has done the same before, against his own <hi>Fellow-Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish-Book,</hi> which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses as his Pattern. Seeing we have but one Libel in our Language, against a whole Country in general, let us
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51287:31"/>
permit the <hi>Historiographer Royal,</hi> to imitate it. Yet I cannot imagine how he came to uuderstand that <hi>Book</hi> alone, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses that he was utterly ignorant of the <hi>English-Tongue</hi> in all things else.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 20.</note> It seems that reviling, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr is so natural to his mind, that he is able to conceive the sence of it, though the <hi>Language</hi> in which it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, be never so much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him. However, if he compare the times of their publication, we shall
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51287:31"/>
find that there is a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between the crimes of the <hi>English,</hi> and the <hi>French Satyrist.</hi> The first of these was publish'd during the Tyranny of the late Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: and though it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry severe on the <hi>English</hi> in many passages, yet the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part was spoken with a good intention, in reproof of the miserable distractions of that Age, and the many ill-Customs which a long Civil-War had introduc'd. I beg of you now, Sir, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, by what an Example
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51287:32"/>
he clears himself. Because there was one Satyr writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on our Nation, in a time of Licentiousness, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion: he will second it now with a Worse, when we are setled in Peace, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity. Seeing he thinks this Plea sufficient, for what he says against the Manners of the <hi>English,</hi> that an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish-man did the same under Oliver,</hi> or <hi>Richard</hi>: I would have him also defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in all his Slanders on our <hi>Court,</hi> and the <hi>King's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> with an argument that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51287:32"/>
will resemble the other. For why may he not assert, that it is lawful for him now to use such Liberty; because <hi>Milton</hi> was allow'd by the <hi>Rump,</hi> to write a Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Book against the late <hi>King</hi> of Blessed Memory?</p>
            <p>This weak excuse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Sir, that he makes for his Barbarous way of hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Us, shall not serve his turn. He is so far from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving receiv'd incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the <hi>English:</hi> that I can shew him several Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes of the Voyages of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51287:33"/>

plaid in the World at seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, that of a violent <hi>Calvinist,</hi> and a <hi>Iesuitical Papist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first, it is false that <hi>our English Reformation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan upon a shamefull occasion,</hi> or from the extravagance of a private passion. I know he has the famous story of <hi>King Henry</hi>'s Divorce to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose against what I say. But I am not startled at that, no more then at the <hi>Fable</hi> of our <hi>Bishops</hi> Consecration at the <hi>Naggs-head Tavern</hi>; or, of the <hi>Kentish-mens</hi> having
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51287:55"/>
long Tayls for the murder of <hi>Thomas Becket.</hi> Such fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous Arguments as these might have served well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the Mouths of the <hi>Moncks</hi> two hundred years agoe: But they will not pass so easily in a Philosophical, and Inquisitive Age. In breif therefore, Sir, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that <hi>King Henry the Eighth</hi> did never intend to proceed to a much greater distance from the <hi>Roman See,</hi> then the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church maintains at this day. There is no man of our <hi>Church,</hi> that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51287:56"/>
looks upon his breach with the <hi>Pope,</hi> to have been a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi> We onely esteem it to be of the nature of those Quarrels, which many <hi>Princes</hi> in the most <hi>Catholick</hi> Countries, have manag'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Holy Chair.</hi> The <hi>Reformation</hi> to which we stand is of a latter date. The <hi>Primitive Reformers</hi> amongst us, beheld the Reason of men tamely subjected to one mans Command, and the Sovereign Powers of all <hi>Christendom</hi> still expos'd to be check'd, and destroy'd
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51287:56"/>
by the Resolutions of his private Will. Upon this they arose to perform two of the greatest Works in the World, at once to deliver the minds of Christians from Tyranny, and the Dignity of the Throne from Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bondage. Whatever was the accidental, this was the Real Cause of our first <hi>Reformation,</hi> and of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from us, not ours from them. And this was an event which must needs have come to pass near the time in which it did, though
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51287:57"/>
               <hi>King Henry</hi> had never forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Wife. Let him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know, that our <hi>Doctrine</hi> (<hi>as much spoyl'd as it is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 45.</note> 
               <hi>in his opinion</hi>) was establish'd by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi>: and that the Ceremonies of our Worship, were not set up by faction, or by popular Fury, but by the deliberate Counsels of Wisemen, and by the authority of that power, which bears the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Image of <hi>God.</hi> This, Sir, I have said in Vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our <hi>Church,</hi> not so much to satisfie this idle
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51287:57"/>
Dreamer upon <hi>Parnassus,</hi> as out of the love which I bear to many well-meaning <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques</hi> amongst us, who have this Argument some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in their mouths, of whom I know very many, whose wishes for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Country, and for its freedom from forein Usurpations, are as honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as any <hi>Englishmens</hi> liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As for <hi>Monsieur de Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bier</hi>'s part, it had been a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Reply to him, that I can name a man, who has indeed <hi>separated from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51287:58"/>
wherein he was born, for a shamefull cause which is known to all the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He declares that <hi>the people of England have an universal aversion from the establish'd Worship.</hi> But here I cannot say that of him for which he commends <hi>Doctor Wallis,</hi> that <hi>He is one of the best Account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants in the World.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 100.</note> This po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Computation he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was in any capacity to make, he never saw any of the middle, or the remoter parts of our Nation, where <hi>Non-conformity</hi> is but very

sparingly spread. He never convers'd with the vast Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Gentry, and Yeoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that live Country lives, who are generally uninfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. It is <hi>London</hi> alone on which he must rely for this calculation. And yet even in this too, I dare openly assure him, that the farr greater number is for the Rights of the Church, then against them. But I advise <hi>Monsieur de Sorbiere,</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thinks himself able to make an exact judgment of the Number of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51287:59"/>
Sects, he would first correct all his errours in <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> which are to be found in this Book, about the most obvious things, in reckoning of which, it was enough to have onely had the understanding of the least childe that he ever taught. I will onely produce one in this place. Have we not reason to rely upon his opinion of the difference of the parties in the whole Kingdom; when in the least number that can be, he has mistaken half: For, he says,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51287:59"/>
that <hi>the double-bottom'd. Vessel has two Masts in the Front,</hi> when every <hi>Sculler</hi> on the <hi>Thames</hi> knows it has but <hi>One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He affirms, that <hi>the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of our Bishops is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but the shaddow, and the corruption of a True Hierarchy.</hi> And he gives this excellent Reason for it, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause here the Spiritual sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to the Temporal.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 44.</note> This ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Argument I will turn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself. It is therefore the True, the Sound, the <hi>Apostolical Episcopacy: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51287:60"/>
it does yield to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Power, which else could be nothing but a shaddow.</hi> It is the glory of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that it never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted Authority, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in Rebellion: which is a praise, that makes much to its advantage, in the minds of all those, who have read of the dismal effects of the <hi>Scotch Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>holy League.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He says, that <hi>our King did put himself on the most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enterprise that could be attempted, when he restored
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51287:60"/>
Episcopacy.</hi> And yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses that <hi>our other Sects are inconsistent with any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but a Common-wealth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 58.</note> What dreadfull danger could be imagin'd in a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs</hi> destroying that, which must needs fall of it self in a <hi>Monarchy?</hi> But to shew how much he was mistaken, It is evident, that upon his <hi>Majesty</hi>'s most glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, the <hi>Church</hi> soon reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd all its rights of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Jurisdiction, of sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Parliament, and even all its Lands, which had
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51287:61"/>
been long held by Armed Usurpers, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Opposition, then what was made by <hi>General Vennor,</hi> and his forty men: who it seems did <hi>run the greatest hazard of the two.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He declares that <hi>there is so great a distance between our Bishops, and our inferior Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, that these dare not speak to, nor stand cover'd before, them.</hi> This, Sir, you and I can prove to be a manifest Untruth, by several Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. But however, what course can we take to please
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51287:61"/>
this grave Censurer of our Civility? <hi>He here dislikes the respects, that we shew to our cheif Churchmen:</hi> and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, <hi>He condemns the familiar behaviour of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Soldiers towards their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.

of Observance, and Courtship, into an <hi>Army.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he accuses us of a greater Crime. It is but just that there should be <hi>so great a distance,</hi> if our <hi>Clergymen that have Pluralities, make their Grooms supply their Cures.</hi> In this part of his Character he certainly, Sir, mistook the Country, and intended this for some other <hi>Kingdom</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> where he had also miss'd of a <hi>Medall.</hi> It is a sign that he is as little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his own <hi>Church,</hi> as he is with ours:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51287:62"/>
or else he would never have <hi>objected to us our Pluralities,</hi> which are infinitely fewer, and more confin'd amongst us: he would never have ventur'd to <hi>upbraid us with the Ignorance of our Parish Priests,</hi> lest we should have provok'd the whole <hi>Church of Rome</hi> to a comparison. In breif, Sir, our <hi>Slaves</hi> do not serve at our <hi>Altars</hi>: and I will also add, that our <hi>Cheif Spiritual Dignities</hi> are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayl'd upon <hi>Families,</hi> nor possess'd by <hi>Children.</hi> In all the <hi>Parishes</hi> of <hi>England</hi>; I

            <p>That <hi>He has presum'd to call our Publique Solemn Prayers, only a Morsel, or a Scrap of a Liturgy</hi>; I do not much wonder. For he that has long made his own <hi>Religion his Cook</hi> (as one of

our Poets expresses it) may well be thought irreligious enough; to take a <hi>Metaphor</hi> for ours from a Kitchin. But besides this, he asserts, that <hi>the Introduction of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Liturgy into Scotland, was the cause of the shedding of all the Blood in the three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> This Speech might have well fitted the mouth of <hi>Bradshaw,</hi> or the Pen of <hi>Ireton.</hi> For it lays all the guilt of so much Slaughter, on the most Innocent, and most merciful <hi>Prince,</hi> that ever wore a Crown: by

whose special care, an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Worship was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in that <hi>Kingdome.</hi> But to give him better light, and to let him see, that there were other Causes of our Miseries, in one of these three Countries at least, I would fain have him ask this Question of the <hi>Pope's Legat</hi> that was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> whether the horrible <hi>Irish Massacre</hi> was committed for no other reason, but only out of a tender Brotherly sense of the Yoke which was laid by the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> on
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51287:64"/>
the <hi>Scotchmen's</hi> Consciences.</p>
            <p>He tells us, that <hi>it is an ordinary thing with our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, to exercise their Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Censures upon frivolous accounts.</hi> But methinks he might have remembred, that it was not probable, they should seek out any trifling occasions of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when, by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, they have so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weighty Provocations: if that be true, that <hi>the whole Nation neglects their Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</hi> But, Sir, you know it is apparent to all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51287:65"/>
Men, that the <hi>Bishops</hi> have been most remarkably moderate in their <hi>Visitations</hi>: and that the Punishments, which have been inflicted on the Obstinate, have for the most part proceeded from the <hi>Temporal</hi> Sword, and not the <hi>Spiritual.</hi> But, because he here quarrels at the Absoluteness of our <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi>'s power, I leave him to be answer'd by the whole <hi>Clergy</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who ought to be alarm'd by this. For if ours shal be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so Tyrannical, what will

He says, <hi>they have imbezled the Church Lands, to make their own Families Rich.</hi> This, Sir, is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which though it was at first manag'd against them with great Clamour, by the common Enemies of the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Church:</hi> yet now upon a calmer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of things, it has universally lost its credit, even in those places where he says,<note place="margin">P. 130.</note>

half the day together; from whence he acknowledges, that he had a good part of his Relations.</hi> The first mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs against them were rais'd, because they receiv'd altogether, some part of that which was their due, for twenty years before. But the Envy of that was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scatter'd, when it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest how many publique, and Generous works they have promoted. Besides the first Fruits, and Tenths, and above all the Subsidies, which have swept away
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51287:66"/>
a good part of their gains, they have compounded with a very great Number of the Purchasers; they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd the Vicaredges in their Gift to Fourscore Pounds a year: they have indow'd Alms-Houses, and Colleges, they have built Chappels, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired the Episcopal Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Cathedrals, which were generally gone to Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; they have redeem'd at once all the <hi>English,</hi> that were Slaves at <hi>Algiers,</hi> and that too I dare assure him,

               <hi>without any intent to make Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Account which he gives of their letting Leases</hi> is most ridiculous. There is no man amongst them, <hi>that lets a Lease for thirty years.</hi> The <hi>Reserv'd Rent</hi> is that which was always the stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Revenue of the <hi>Church.</hi> Nor ought this Custom to be Objected against the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> It is the same course which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <hi>France,</hi> and most o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of <hi>Christendom.</hi> Nay, to go farther, the <hi>letting</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:51287:67"/>
of <hi>Church Leases</hi> is a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, whose Regulation was brought about since the time, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> divided from us. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Queen Elizabeth's</hi> reign, the <hi>Churchmen</hi> had a power of Farming out their Lands, not only for <hi>Thirty,</hi> but for <hi>Ninety Nine</hi> years. It was <hi>Shee,</hi> that first confin'd the Term to <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Twenty</hi>; and so it still remains. He ought not therefore <hi>to reckon this practice as our disgrace</hi>: when the good order, that is now us'd about it, is the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar

honour, that belongs to the <hi>English Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to Conclude, if <hi>no Man fears Simony in England,</hi> then there is no man that is affrighted with punishment. For our Laws are as strict against it, and as severely executed, as any where else. However, if it were true, (which is far from being so) that we Simoniacally imploy the Church estate to Secular uses; yet this sounds very ill from that <hi>Layman's</hi> Pen, who, when he writ this Voyage, was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51287:68"/>
out of the <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Revenue.</hi> This, Sir, was <hi>Monsieur de Sorbiere's Case.</hi> And the first Office of a <hi>Churchman</hi> that ever he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, was in this Book,<note place="margin">P. 99.</note> where <hi>He devoutly prays to God, to make Mr. Hobbs a Roman Catholique.</hi> Which if his prayers can obtain from Heaven, he deserves not only to be made a <hi>Priest,</hi> or <hi>Bishop,</hi> but even a <hi>Saint</hi> too: For this will be a far greater <hi>Miracle,</hi> then any of those for which many have been <hi>Canoniz'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:51287:69"/>And now, Sir, can you require any greater signs of <hi>Monsieur de Sorbier's</hi> Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in his <hi>Religion</hi>? He has accus'd of <hi>Simony,</hi> the most Incorrupt: of Pride, the Humblest: of Rapacity, the most Innocent: of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the most Learned: of false Doctrine, the most Primitive; of ill Discipline, the most Decent <hi>Church</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven. And when nothing else could be said, he even <hi>upbraids it with its Submission and Obedience,</hi> To shew, (that he is as ill a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciple
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51287:69"/>
of <hi>Mr. Hobbes's,</hi> whom he pretends to admire, as he is of the Apostles.) Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Disgraces, there remains this one comfort to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that the same man, who now vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies Her so basely, had once as mean thoughts of the <hi>God-Head</hi> of Her blessed <hi>Founder</hi> Himself.</p>
            <p>But it is easie to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture at the Cause of this his harsh Usage of our <hi>Church.</hi> He had but lately Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd from the <hi>Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:51287:70"/>
in <hi>France</hi>: he was but just enter'd into the <hi>Romish</hi> Communion. And he su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, that there might be some doubts still remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on mens minds, of the Reality of his Conversion, which might turn to the prejudice not onely of his Spiritual, but of his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Estate: he had given himself out for a great <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher:</hi> and he understood well enough, that few Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers are thought to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their minds, that have once been <hi>Protestants.</hi> He
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51287:70"/>
was therefore resolv'd to give an Unquestionable proof of his Establishment in the Faith, by reviling <hi>the Church of England.</hi> And in performing this, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, Sir, he has Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the Zealot very well: he has prosecuted Us, with all the Violence, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gottry, which commonly accompanies new Converts. But yet I beleive this will hardly do his business. Even in this very Book, he gives Evidence enough, that <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinism,</hi> and <hi>Heresie,</hi> are not
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51287:71"/>
wholy rooted out of his Heart. He grosly abuses the most devoted Children of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>English Roman Catholiques.</hi> He complains of them,<note place="margin">P. 64.</note> 
               <hi>that they have no mind to disturb the Peace of their Country to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mards the restoration of their Religion</hi>: which is indeed spoken to their Honour, though he intends it to their Shame. He says,<note place="margin">P. 64.</note> 
               <hi>that they are not so zealous in their Way, as forein Papists,</hi> the quite contrary to which is true: he makes, <note place="margin">P. 64.</note> 
               <hi>as if they never
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51287:71"/>
saw the True Mass perform'd:</hi> he affirms,<note place="margin">P. 64.</note> 
               <hi>that they are all born in Servitude,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bases so many Antient, Rich, and Honourable Families, to the condition, and the minds, of <hi>Slaves.</hi> In all these Speeches, he does not express any certain mark of a True Proselyte. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, he has set down such a determination of his Faith, that if he had made it in <hi>Italy,</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> he had undoubtedly fallen into the <hi>Inquisition.</hi> He boldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces, that <hi>Transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,

Purgatory, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Works,</hi>

               <hi>Invocation of Saints, the Supremacy of the Bishop of Rome, the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Councils, and the Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of the Pope, are none of them Fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</hi> What greater A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology could be made for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which he has so much defam'd: seeing these are the onely <hi>shameful Causes, for which we dissented from Rome?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I leave him to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Pope's Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51287:72"/>
for these Heresies: which perhaps the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has reason to think, do more shake the Holy Chair, then the five points of <hi>Ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senius</hi> that he condemn'd: which Monsieur de Sorbiere says,<note place="margin">P. 60.</note> 
               <hi>did raise a dispute about a matter of Nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From our <hi>Religion,</hi> Let us follow him of our <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And here, Sir, I was at first a little at a stand how to deal with him. But I have heard of the Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous resolution of the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51287:73"/>
late <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who would never permit any <hi>Apology</hi> to be written for him. And I consider, that it is almost as great an arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance for <hi>one</hi> obscure <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> to undertake to defend the Actions of Great <hi>Princes,</hi> as it is for <hi>another</hi> to defame them. I will not therefore inlarge my Speech in the praises of the present hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of <hi>England,</hi> or in paying all the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are due to our <hi>Sovereign,</hi> for the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of His <hi>Reign.</hi> That is
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51287:73"/>
a Subject ficter for a more elaborate Volum, then a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Letter, and for a far more elegant Pen then mine. I will onely here shew the Vanity of our <hi>Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> groundless suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And as an Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to what he says, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Political</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this <hi>Nation,</hi> I will first observe how he deals with some others of the cheif <hi>Crown'd Heads</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi> You will perhaps, Sir, be very hardly induc'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, that he can be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51287:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of disrespect to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or <hi>Sovereign Princes,</hi> when you behold him so Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically given towards that Government, as to take the pains, to go five or six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand miles, to find out a Race of <hi>Kings</hi> to commend. For he here speaks very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously <hi>in praise of the most vertuous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 117, 118.</note> 
               <hi>and most religious Kings of China.</hi> This, Sir, I cannot but applaud in him; and to shew how much this one testimony of his good manners has wrought with me, I will not be harsh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

him in this place. I will not call in question the credit of his Intelligence from the farthest East, which you see is so false, about a Country, that lies only <hi>seven Leagues distant</hi> from his own. Nay, I will not so much as inquire whether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he met with any <hi>Chinese Madam Fiennes to give him this Information.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 118.</note> I will graunt, that the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>China</hi> have been <hi>great Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Bridges,</hi> and <hi>Planters of Orchards.</hi> But I will on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now softly put him in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51287:75"/>
mind, that while his Pen did overflow with sweet words, upon the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>China,</hi> he has handled the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> more cruelly, then <hi>Dionysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Tyrant would have done, when he was a <hi>King,</hi> much less when he was a <hi>Schole-Master.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the two last <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Sweden</hi> he affirms, that <hi>their Glory is almost wholy vanish'd:</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 116.</note> 
               <hi>and that all moderate men must needs read the Desolations, which they caus'd with Horror.</hi> You see, Sir, what an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51287:75"/>
occasion he has here given me of Triumphing over him. You know very well, how many great, and irresistable arguments, this matter might suggest to me: what might not be said of that <hi>Victorious Nation?</hi> how copious might I be in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling the indefatigable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, the Conduct, the Good Fortune, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity of those <hi>Kings</hi>? What Passions might here be rais'd, in appealing to all Mankind, and in aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the common misery of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51287:76"/>
all Great Commanders of Armies, if it shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to every small Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleteer to invade their Lives, and to arraign their Ashes, when he pleases? But there is no need of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so powerfully to work, or of imploying against him any of the Lofty, and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Forces of Eloquence. It will suffice, if I recall to his Memory, the Title in which he boasts so much. I will only ask him, how the <hi>Historiographer</hi> of <hi>France</hi> can assert the Wars of <hi>Gustavus
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51287:76"/>
Adolphus</hi> to have been hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Divastations, without casting some share of the Dishonor on the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>France</hi> it self? For (if we will believe all the <hi>French</hi> Writers of that time) there was a strict Confederacy, and a real Union of Interests, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those Two <hi>mighty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs.</hi> I give him leave to use the Fame of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Sweden</hi> as he pleases. Let them in his account pass for Theives, and Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. They deserve so to be us'd: for they were mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51287:77"/>
Enemies to that belov'd Country, with whose <hi>Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But the Fame of those <hi>dead Princes</hi> is plac'd above
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51287:77"/>
the reach of his Envy: let us, Sir, consider how he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haves himself towards the living. What a long Story (or rather, as he himself stiles it, <hi>Romance</hi>) has he here made, of the life of <hi>Vlefelt</hi> the <hi>Dane, on which he builds the justification of his Crimes, and condemns the King of Denmark's Iustice?</hi> And yet at the same time he acknowledges, that <hi>He took the whole Relation, only from the Mouth of Vlefelt's own Wife.</hi> After this, have the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>China</hi> any great reason to be
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51287:78"/>
proud of this Mans good will? when he has here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd no more Judgment, nor Integrity, then from the single and partial Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of a Woman, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit a man that had been hang'd <hi>in Effigie</hi> in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> and has been since kill'd as he was pursued for High Treason?</p>
            <p>Upon the sight of all this, Sir, I may well return se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely Home, to examine his opinion of the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of our State. And here I must not forget to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51287:78"/>
acquaint you, that he is not all over Satyrical; But in several places he sprinkles some few kind words to our advantage. Yet his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations are so directly contrary to his reproaches; that instead of reconciling me to him, they rather sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply me with new arguments against him. And who can desire an easier Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to deal with, then such a one, who, when he speaks against us, opposes evident Truth, when he speaks for us, contradicts himfelf?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:51287:79"/>This Inconsistence of his own mind with it self, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in this <hi>Political</hi> part of his <hi>Relation,</hi> which now comes under my Censure: He confesses, <hi>Our King to be one of the best Princes in the World:</hi>

               <note place="margin">P. 120.</note> I intreat you now, Sir, to recollect, how this, and that which follows hangs together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:51287:79"/>First, He suggests,<note place="margin">P. 124.</note> 
               <hi>that perhaps there was not so much pretence for the people to rebel in the late Kings time, as there is at this present.</hi> In the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply which I shall make to this Passage, I cannot, Sir, confine my self to the bare limits of a satisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: but I must permit my Zeal for the Prosperity of our Country, to break forth into Expressions of Joy, and Gratitude. It is fit that all the World should know, that as our <hi>King</hi> was restor'd with the most mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51287:80"/>
submission of minds, and interests, that ever any <hi>History</hi> can shew: as he was establish'd on the Throne of his <hi>Ancestors,</hi> while there were two mighty Armies on Foot, that had fought against <hi>him</hi> and his <hi>Father</hi>: so there can be no difficulty in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing this quiet, now he has all the power of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his hands, and now his Enemies are scattered, and disarm'd (if yet he can be thought to have any real Enemies, after so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Heroick Testimonies of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51287:80"/>
his Mercy) The condition of all his affairs abroad is in such a posture, in respect of his Neighbors, that he is as far from being lyable to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Injuries unreveng'd, as he is averse in his own disposition from doing wrongs unprovok'd. And the small dissentions that still remain on some of his Subjects minds at home, are so far from hazarding the safety, that they will rather make for the Honor of his <hi>Reign.</hi> For by his renew'd and generous indeavors to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51287:81"/>
the composing of these differences, there will arise for him a continued succession of Peaceful Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, of which the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions had been wanting to him, if he had found us all of one mind. And many such Victories as these, we may justly presage to our <hi>Sovereigns</hi> future Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Forces which he employs against those few that are still contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, which are those of Affability, and Forgiveness, are impossible to be resisted.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51287:100"/>
For I am to consider my self, as a Member of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> and the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and the <hi>Earl of Clarendon,</hi> as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of one them,</hi> and <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi> of the <hi>other.</hi>

            <p>These, Sir, are some of his true Titles, however <hi>Monsieur de Sorbiere</hi> is pleas'd to pass them over, and give him worse in their stead. First of all, <hi>he says that he is a Presbyterian.</hi>

<q>

               </q>
Thus farr, Sir, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to him: But more is to be added concerning the <hi>Honourable Person,</hi> of whom he speaks in such mean terms. My <hi>Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi> is a Gentleman of a very antient Family, of which Mr <hi>Cambden</hi> makes mention in his <hi>Britannia.</hi>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:51287:105"/>
His Education and first years were spent in a strict familiarity with many of the most Famous Men, not only of that Age, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of any other: of whom (to pass by some Reverend and Learned <hi>Church-men</hi> that are living) it is enough to name Mr <hi>Chillingsworth,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Falkland.</hi> His first application to the Affairs of his Countrey, was in a time wherein ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary fidelity and sufficience were requir'd. His Services to the late
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:51287:105"/>
               <hi>King</hi> were requited by the committing of many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Businesses to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement; and by a very high share in his <hi>Majesties</hi> Favour; of which there are indelible proofs in many places of that <hi>Excellent Prince's Letters.</hi> Under him he was <hi>Chancellor</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer, Privy Counsellor,</hi> and design'd <hi>Secretary</hi> of <hi>State.</hi> Since that time h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:51287:106"/>
the most glorious Scene of Honour in the world. By these several degrees of Great Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he ascended to that illustrious Station which he now enjoyes. And as for the Qualifications of his Minde, if it be needfull to adde any thing to the Votes of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> and the <hi>Vniversity</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> I will declare, that of all the men of great worth, who have possess'd that High Office, since Learning and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Arts came amongst us,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51287:106"/>
there was never any man that has so much resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Excellencies, as the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Clarendon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There might, Sir, much more be answer'd against all his false Insinuations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Political Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> But I have seen a <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Monsieur de Sorbiere's Discourses</hi> and <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> whereof many were written to the late <hi>Cardinal Mazarini</hi>; and they are so full of gross flatteries, that
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:51287:107"/>
they have wholly turn'd my stomach, from speaking any more of <hi>State Affairs:</hi> So that in truth, in the present humour into which the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them has put me, I had much rather offend on the other extream, by an unjust silence, then by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent praises of the <hi>English Government.</hi> I will therefore conclude this whole matter, as I began it, by reflecting on a Passage of his own, in the story of <hi>Vlefelt</hi>; wherein he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven undeniable testimony,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:51287:107"/>
that he is wholly ignorant of the Rights of Princes, the true Policy, and the Law of Nations. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,<note place="margin">P. 184.</note> that <hi>Vlefelt fled into Sweden; that he became there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by effectually a Traytor, that he was the cause of the Swedes last invasion into Denmark, by advising</hi> Carolus Gustavus <hi>to turn his Army, from the Poles, against Coppenhagen.</hi> These are his own words. And what more apparent Crime could there be then this, which had like to have drawn after it the utter Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:51287:108"/>
of that <hi>Kingdome?</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 186.</note> And yet immediately after he professes, <hi>that he makes no doubt, but the Illustrious He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, Vlefelt, and his Wife, will live to see their great merits acknowledg'd, and to enjoy in peace the applauses that are due to them for their fidelity to their King, and their zeal for the Fundamental Laws of their Countrey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this, Sir, I suppose, is one of those which he himself calls the <hi>Besueues of his stile:</hi>
               <note place="margin">

uses to forgive,</hi> yet the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> did not think fit to pass by.</p>
            <p>This is the Idea that he has drawn of the <hi>Manners,</hi> the <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>English.</hi> But these are not the subjects which he principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards: such matters as these, he confesses, that <hi>he only uses to touch upon, as they come in his way.</hi>

For his long Tale of his Journy to <hi>Oxford,</hi> is made up of such childish con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations: While he was speaking of that place, which for the beauty, and convenience of its buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, for the vastness of its revenue, and above all, for the sobriety, the virtue, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:51287:116"/>
the piety of its discipline, is to be prefer'd before all others that have been ever dedicated to liberal Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in the past, or present times.</p>
            <p>But here, Sir, I confess I have been a little too rigid upon him. It was ill done of me, to expect that he should on the sudden turn so unlike himself, as to give a good account of our <hi>Vniversity</hi> alone.

things in <hi>Oxford.</hi> My quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel to him now is upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other score. He has here committed a grosse over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight in his own way: For in this exact enumeration of all our fine Rarities, he has wholy pass'd by one famous Curiosity, which was of all others the most proper for such an <hi>Historiographer,</hi> or at least for such a <hi>Trumpeter</hi> to mention, and that is <hi>Queens College Horn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From his new acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I proceed to his rudeness, towards the only

               <note place="margin">P. 65.</note> Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> was <hi>the chief man for whose sake he came over, and he speaks very</hi> many great things in his commendation: <hi>he prayses his good humor,</hi>

Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> lays not so much stress, for his good Breeding: but he wounds him in the most dangerous place, his Philosophy, and his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. He very kindly reports of him,<note place="margin">P. 97.</note> that <hi>he is too dogmatical in his Opinions:</hi>

The Title of <hi>Dogmatical</hi> which he gives him, being propounded by a declar'd <hi>Sceptick,</hi> was the worst fault that could be charg'd on a Philosopher: and indeed it is the same, that <hi>he bestows on Borri,</hi>

            <p>But however, to comfort Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> for this affront, I dare assure him, that as for <hi>Monsieur de Sorbiere's</hi> part, he understands not his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.

Can you, Sir, indure to read all this stuff with any pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience?

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:51287:122"/>
yielded him so much noble matter for his Pen? And when the <hi>Royal Society</hi> it self is so careful, that such ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies should be just no more, then what are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to avoyd confusion? What other Language should he have us'd then this, if he had been to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the World of his own <hi>Schole</hi> at <hi>Orange</hi>? Just so he should have proceeded. He should first have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, whether the Room were Hung, or Wainscotted: Next, whether the Master

sate with his back towards the Window, or the Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: then how many Seats there were for the Boys to sit upon: at last he should have drawn himself in a majestick Chair, his <hi>Ferula</hi> in his hand, and the poor Scholars trembling for fear at every rap on the Table.</p>
            <p>But all this is still par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable: he has been utterly mistaken in the report of their main design. There are two things, that they have most industriously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, which he attributes
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:51287:123"/>
to them: the one <hi>is a dividing into parties, and Sects; and</hi> the other, <hi>a reliance upon Books, for their intelligence of Nature.</hi> He first says, that <hi>they are not all guided by the authority of Gassendus,</hi>

               <hi>or Des Cartes</hi>; but <hi>that the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians are for Des Cartes, and the Men of General Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for Gassendus.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as neither of these two Men bear any sway amongst them: they are never nam'd there as Dictators over men's Reasons; nor is there any extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

to their judgments. He also asserts that <hi>the Royal Society has appointed Lodgings, and establish'd four thousand Livres a year,</hi>

               <hi>upon two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors, who shall read to them out of Authors, and that they have begun a Library for that purpose.</hi> Whereas they have as yet no Library, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Repository for their Instruments, and Rarities: they never intend a Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorian Philosophy, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare against it: with Books they meddle not farther, then to see what Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

               </gap>erve to balance that which he afterwards says of our Books,<note place="margin">P. 169.</note> that <hi>they are generally stoln out of other Authors.</hi> But I will fetch the grounds of my persuasion, from the very nature, and use, of the Stage it self. It is beyond all dispute, that the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of such Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, is, to give to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:51287:127"/>
a Picture of themselves; and thereby to make Virtue belov'd, Vice abhor'd, and the little irregularities of mens tempers, call'd hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, expos'd to laughter. The Two first of these are the proper subjects of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,</hi> and <hi>Trage-Comedy.</hi> And in these I will first try to shew, why our way ought to be preferr'd before theirs. The <hi>French,</hi> for the most part, take only one, or two Great Men, and chiefly insist on some one remarkable accident of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:51287:128"/>
their Story: To this end, they admit no more Persons, then will barely serve to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn that: And they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage all in Rhythme, with long Speeches, almost in the way of Dialogues, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king high Ideas of Honor, and in speaking Noble things. The <hi>English,</hi> on the other side, make their chief Plot to consist of a greater variety of Actions, and besides the main design, add many other little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances. By this means, their Scenes are shorter,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:51287:128"/>
their Stage fuller, many more Persons of different Humors are introduc'd. And in carrying on of this, they generally do only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine themselves to blanck Verse. This is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. And hence the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> have these advantages. By the liberty of Prose, they render their Speech, and Pronuntiation, more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and are never put to make a contention between the Rhythm, and the Sence. By their underplots, they often change the minds of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:51287:129"/>
their Spectators: which is a mighty Benefit, seeing one of the greatest Arts of Wit and persuasion, is the right ordering of Digressions. By their full Stage, they prevent men's being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually tyr'd with the same Objects: and so they make the Doctrine of the Scene to be more lively, and divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then the precepts of Philosophers, or the grave delight of <hi>Heroick Poetry</hi>: which the <hi>French Tragedies</hi> do resemble. Nor is it sufficient to object against
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:51287:129"/>
this, that it is undecent to thrust in men of mean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, amongst the actions of <hi>Princes.</hi> For why should that misbecome the Stage, which is always found to be acted on the <hi>True Theatre</hi> of the World? There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Court, which only consists of <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Queens,</hi> and <hi>Counsellors</hi> of <hi>State.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these accounts, Sir, in my weak judgment, the <hi>French Drama</hi> ought to give place to the <hi>English,</hi> in the Tragical and lofty part of it. And now having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:51287:130"/>
this, I suppose they will of their own accord resigne the other excellence, and confess that we have far exceeded them in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of different Humors. The Truth is, the <hi>French</hi> have alwaies seem'd almost asham'd of the true <hi>Comedy</hi>: making it not much more then the subject of their <hi>Farses:</hi> whereas the <hi>English</hi> Stage has so much abounded with it, that perhaps there is scarce any sort of extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of which the minds
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:51287:130"/>
of men are capable, but they have in some measure express'd. It is in <hi>Comedies,</hi> and not in <hi>Solemn Histories,</hi> that the <hi>English</hi> use to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Speeches</hi> of <hi>Waggo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> of <hi>Fencers,</hi> and of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers.</hi> And this I dare assure <hi>Monsieur de Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biere,</hi> that if he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood our Language, he might have seen himself in all his shapes, as a <hi>vain Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,</hi> an <hi>empty Politician,</hi> an <hi>insolent Pedant,</hi> and an <hi>idle pretender to Learning.</hi> But though he was not in a
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:51287:131"/>
condition of taking advice from our Stage, for the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of his own Vices, yet methinks he might thereby have rectify'd his judgment about ours: he might well have concluded, that the <hi>English temper, is not so universally heavy and dumpish,</hi> when he beheld their Theatres, to be the gayest, and merriest in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>English Eloquence,</hi> he bravely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,<note place="margin">P. 168, 169.</note> that <hi>all their Sermons in the Pulpit, and Pleadings

               <note place="margin">P. 168, 169.</note> 
               <hi>consist of nothing but mean pedantry.</hi> The cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is bold, especially from a man that was so far from understanding our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that he scarce knew, <hi>Whether we move our lips,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 169.</note> 
               <hi>or no, when we speak.</hi> But to shew him, that we can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judge of <hi>Monsieur de Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bier's Eloquence,</hi> I must tell him, that the <hi>Muses</hi> and <hi>Parnassus</hi> are almost whip't out of our very Scholes: That there are many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of <hi>Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who have
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:51287:132"/>
long known how to contemn such delicacies of his stile. I will only give one instance for all. I believe, he could scarce have Brib'd any Scriveners Clerk, to describe <hi>Hatfield</hi> as he has done, and so to conclude,<note place="margin">P. 158.</note> 
               <hi>That the Fishes in the Ponds did often leap out of the water into the air, to behold, and to delight themselves with the beauties of that place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the <hi>Ornaments,</hi> or the <hi>Copiousnesse</hi> of our <hi>Language,</hi> against one that <hi>is utterly
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:51287:132"/>
ignorant of it.</hi> But to shew how plentifull it is, I will only repeat an observation, which the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Clarendon</hi> has made; That there is scarce any Language in the world, which can properly signify one English expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that is <hi>Good Nature.</hi> Though <hi>Monsieur de Sorbiere</hi> will not allow the <hi>Noble Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of this <hi>Note, to have any skill in Grammar Learning:</hi> Yet he must pardon me, if I still believe the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be true: At least, I assure you, Sir, that after all
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:51287:133"/>
my search, I cannot find any one word in his <hi>Book,</hi> which might incline me to think otherwise.</p>
            <p>But I will be content to lay the whole authority of his judgement in matters of Wit, and Elegance, upon what he sayes concerning the <hi>English Books.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 168, 169.</note> He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, <hi>That they are only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent thefts out of others, without citing their Authors, and that they contain nothing, but ill Rhapsodies of matter, worse put together.</hi> And here, Sir, I will for once do him a
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:51287:133"/>
courtesie. I will suppose him not to have taken this one character of us, from the <hi>Soldier,</hi> the <hi>Zealander,</hi> the <hi>Puritans,</hi> or the <hi>Rabble</hi> of the <hi>Streets</hi>: I will grant he might have taken an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of our writings, before he came over, from the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all judgement, which the Southern wits of the world, are wont to passe on the wit of all Northern Countries. 'Tis true indeed, I think the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Italians,</hi> would scarce be so unneigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly, as to assert, that <hi>all
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:51287:134"/>
our Authors are Theivish Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.</hi> That is <hi>Monsieur de Sorbier's</hi> own addition, but yet they generally agree, that there is scarce anything of late written, that is worth looking upon, but in their own Languages. The <hi>Italians</hi> did at first indeavour to have it thought, that all matters of Elegance, had never yet pass'd over the <hi>Alps</hi>: but being soon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd by Number, they were content to admit the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> into some share of the ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nour.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:51287:134"/>
But they all three still maintain this united opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that all wit is to be sought for no where but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves: It is their establish'd Rule, that good sence has alwayes kept neer the warm Sun, and scarce ever yet dar'd to come farther then the forty ninth degree Northward. This, Sir, is a pretty imagination of theirs; to think they have confin'd all <hi>Art</hi> to a <hi>Geographicall Circle,</hi> and to fancy that it is there so charm'd, as not to be able
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:51287:135"/>
to go out of the bounds which they have set it. It were certainly an easy and a pleasant work to confute this arrogant conception, by particular examples: It might quickly be shewn; that <hi>England, Germany, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> nay, even <hi>Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> have produc'd ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y many men, who may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come into competition with the best of these Southern wits, in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the true Arts of life, in all the works of solid reason, nay, even in
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:51287:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the lighter studies of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and humanity. And, to speak particularly of <hi>England,</hi> there might be a whole <hi>Volume</hi> compos'd in comparing the Chastity, the newnesse, the vigour of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our <hi>English</hi> Fancies, with the corrupt, and the swelling Metaphors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with some of our Neighbors, who most admire themselves do still adorn their Books. But this, Sir, will require a larger discourse then I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to bestow on <hi>Monsieur de Sorbiere.</hi> I am able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch

               </gap> For I wonder how, of all men living, it could enter into his thoughts, <hi>To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn in grosse the English Writings,</hi> when the best course that he has taken to make himself consider'd as a writer, was the <hi>Translation</hi> of an <hi>English Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I beg your leave, Sir, that I may briefly add, That in the first Restoration of Learning, the <hi>English</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to write well, as soon as any, the <hi>Italians</hi> only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and that if we may

ghesse by what we see of the <hi>Italians</hi> at this day, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> have continued to write well, longer then they. Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> was contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary with <hi>Erasmus,</hi> and though <hi>he was a man of the Law too,</hi> yet he yielded not much to that incomparable man, in the plenty of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, or the Masculine easinesse of his stile. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver since that time down to this (if we may take a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the <hi>English,</hi> by what <hi>Tully</hi> says of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in their most flourishing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:51287:137"/>
that <hi>they had scarce above one excellent Poet or Orator in an age</hi>) we may make a very advantagious computation, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Country. We have at this present, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Masters of true and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Wit, as ever <hi>Greece</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in one age, whose names though I conceal, yet posterity shall declare. We have had many admirable <hi>Geniuses</hi> in <hi>Poetry,</hi> who have handled most of the antient and modern subjects of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, with wonderfull success.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:51287:137"/>
We can name many faithfull and diligent <hi>Historians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 185, 186.</note> such as never strove to <hi>frame a Romance out of every story, that they manag'd.</hi> And the number of these will be shortly increas'd by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of <hi>a great man,</hi> from whom we hope to receive the <hi>History</hi> of our late warrs, a subject fit for the pen of a <hi>Privy Counsellor to Kings,</hi> who had himself a great share in the conduct of these affairs which he is to relate. Our <hi>Mathematicians</hi> we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most equall to those of all

               <hi>Europe</hi> besides: Our <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> have long bin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded by all the Learned world; and certainly their <hi>Renowned Colledge</hi> at <hi>London</hi> deserv'd to have bin men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as well as the <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> at the <hi>Red-Bull.</hi> Our famous <hi>Divines</hi> have been innumerable, as the <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> may witnesse, who, in some of their Theologicall Treatises, have bin as bold with the <hi>English Sermons,</hi> as with our Fishing, and their robberies have bin so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that our Church ought
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:51287:138"/>
to have Reprisalls against them as well as our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. We have had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Philosophers,</hi> of a strong, vigorous, and forcible judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of happy and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hands, of a sincere, a modest, a solid, an unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expression, such who have not thought it enough to set up for Philosophers, only to have got a large stock of fine words, and to have insinuated into the acquaintance of some of the great Philosophers of the age. And above all, we
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:51287:139"/>
have one small Book, which we dare oppose to all the Treasures of the <hi>Eastern,</hi> and <hi>Western</hi> Languages, it is that which was written by our Late <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Martyr</hi>: Whose Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After all these signs of his excellent judgment, and generous mind, there still,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:51287:139"/>
Sir, remains that which he has given of his <hi>good Palat, For he has boldly determin'd the controversie, that had long depended in all the Kitchings of England, and France, which is the best way of eating, Chines of Beef, and Mutton, or Bisques, and Potages.</hi> This, I confesse, was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fit to be decided by that <hi>Historian, Critick, Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician, Orator,</hi> and <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian,</hi> Who had <hi>Travell'd throughout the world to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint himselfe with all the Learned men of all countries,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:51287:140"/>
and to push on all Sciences to perfection.</hi> He has here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed behav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You see, Sir, how fairly I treat him, I allow the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Criticisms of his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite to be a part of his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy; and I look upon his affection to <hi>Fricacies</hi> before <hi>whole Ioynts,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his love to the Doctrine of <hi>Atoms,</hi> before
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:51287:140"/>
that of the two great stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dishes of <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form.</hi> But yet I must tell him, that perhaps this Rigid condemning of the <hi>English Cookery,</hi> did not so well suit with his belov'd Title of <hi>Sceptick.</hi> According to the lawes of that profession, he should first have long debated whether there be any tast, or no; whether the steam of a pot be only a fancy, or a reall thing; whether the Kitchin fire has indeed the good qualities of rosting, and Boiling,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:51287:141"/>
or whether it be only an appearance. This had bin a dispute more becomming a <hi>Sceptick,</hi> then thus to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Dogmatically on all the <hi>Intrigues</hi> of <hi>Haut gousts</hi>; and to raise an endlesse spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative quarrel between those that had bin hitherto peaceful and practical <hi>Sects,</hi> the <hi>Hashe's,</hi> and the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loiners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may now, Sir, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps expect, that I should make some Comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>French Dyet</hi> and the <hi>English.</hi> It were, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:51287:141"/>
a pleasant, and a weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty argument. But I am resolv'd to passe it over: not that I think we have the worst of the cause; but for a particular reason of my own. It is that <hi>Monsieur de Sorbiere</hi> may still remain in his error; For as long as he is ignorant that there is any good <hi>House Keeping</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> we are like to have no more of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; yet I cannot but say to the advantage of <hi>Boil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But now, Sir, I confesse he has quite tyr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

an issue with him: I will satisfie him in the request which he makes to this Reader. I am content <hi>to conclude from these his three moneths travells, what kind of Observations he has made in the world these thirty years.</hi> This, Sir, is his own desire, and I obey him. But then I know not how he will be able to avoid the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those Crimes with which he has so often slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the <hi>English,</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Doe-little,</hi> an <hi>Idle,</hi> a <hi>Lazy,</hi> and a <hi>Vseless</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

The description of his <hi>Voyage into Holland</hi> is not yet come to my hands: but if it be of the same thread with this, he had bin much better imploy'd, if he had only imitated the <hi>Roman Emperours</hi> journey thither, and <hi>gone to gather Cockle-shells on that shore.</hi> If he has any <hi>friends amongst all the learned men of Europe, that were once his familiars,</hi> they would do well to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise him what weight his mind will bear: he is himself in the right, when he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges,

(to conclude with his own dear Epithete) he may make a sufficient <hi>Trumpeter</hi> in the Common-wealth of Learning.

the <hi>Historiographer Royal,</hi> that I may speedily put an end to your trouble, I will only in few words ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my speech to your self. You may perhaps remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that we have sometimes debated together, what place and time of all the past, or present, we would have chosen to live in, if our fates had bin at our own disposal; and in that discourse, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of <hi>desiring to have bin born in China,</hi> we both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that <hi>Rome,</hi> in the <hi>Reign</hi> of <hi>Augustus,</hi> was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:51287:145"/>
before all others. The prerogatives of that time were very many: That <hi>City</hi> was then become the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd seat of the <hi>Empire</hi> of the world: that <hi>Emperour</hi> had the good fortune to succeed a long civil war: the minds of all men were easily compos'd into obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by the remembrance of their past misfortunes: the arts of Wit, Reason, and delight were in their high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est perfection: the Court was the place of resort, for all the Lovers of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

the late dreadfull war are not only vanish'd from our eies, but now almost from our thoughts. If any thing of it still remains, it is only the good effect which it had on our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the industry that was excited by it, and the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which such wofull experience has taught us. The Government which we injoy, is justly compos'd of a sufficient liberty, and restraint. And though it may be suspected in a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous and discontented
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:51287:147"/>
Age, a little to incline the people to disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; yet in a calme, and a secure time (such as this at present) it serves admirably well to breed a generous, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and invincible spirit. The temper of the <hi>English</hi> is free, Modest, Sincere, Kind, hard to be provok'd: if they are not so talkative as others, yet they are more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of what they speak: if they are thought, by some of their neighbours,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51287:148"/>
to be a little defective in the gentleness, and the pliableness of their humour; yet that want is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly supplyed, by their firme and their Masculine virtues: and perhaps the same observation may be found true in men, which is in Mettals, that those of the strongest, and the Noblest substance are hardest to be polisht. The Arts that now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail amongst us, are not only all the usefull Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Antiquity, but
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:51287:148"/>
most especially all the late discoveries of this Age in the reall knowledge of mankind, and nature. For the improvement of this kind of light, the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> disposition is of all others the fittest. And an universal zeal towards the advancement of such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, has not only over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread our <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities</hi>; but the Shops of our Mechanicks, the fields of our Gentlemen, the Cottages of our Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and the Ships of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:51287:149"/>
our Merchants. To all this, Sir, may be added the Profession of such a <hi>Religion,</hi> and the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of such a <hi>Church,</hi> which an impartial Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher would chuse: which by falling with the <hi>Throne,</hi> and by rising with it again, has given evident signe, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent it is with the Laws of humane society, and how neerly its interest is united with the prosperity of our Country.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed that
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:51287:149"/>
after all these advantages, there may be some room still left for future amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the union of our minds, the smooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our manners, and the Beauty of our Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. This last was the peculiar honour of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi> who is said <hi>to have found Rome of Brick, and to have left it of Marble.</hi> In this kind too we every day behold a wonderful progress, by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full influence of a <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Example:</hi> so that I
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:51287:150"/>
may in generall affirm, that never any Nation in the world has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by swifter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, to excell in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence. But whatever is to be added in this, or any other such way, we can never receive it from the petulant cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of such vain Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers, as this whom I have here consider'd. No, Sir, we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it from the many Noble and practicall <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:51287:150"/>
Wits of this Age: and chiefly from your self. For you must give me leave, Sir, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, that to you your Country is to owe very much of its Ornament, as well as experimental knowledge, its reputation and indeed all the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and Beneficial Arts, the enlargement of their Bounds. This, Sir, I know will offend your modesty; but he is an ill <hi>English-man,</hi> who would not have said as much
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:51287:151"/>
as this, when your name was mentioned: which if I had omitted, I had bin almost as injurious to our Nation, as this very <hi>Traveller</hi> whom I censure: for as he was un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ust in aggravating the faults, so I my selfe had been, in concealing one of the principall glories of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beg of you now, Sir, only to permit me to conclude with some Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for my self. You may, perhaps, wonder all
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:51287:151"/>
this while to see me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake such an argument, and to prosecute it in a manner, which may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear perhaps a little too sharp for your eye, or my pen. You know, Sir, that I am enemy to all manner of controversies, that I hate contention, though in matters of the greatest concernment, and that I had much rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, then accuse: To this I can therefore only reply, for my excuse, that this <hi>Letter</hi> may not so properly
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:51287:152"/>
be call'd an <hi>Accusation,</hi> as a <hi>Defence</hi>: For though I have confuted the sawciness of one particular <hi>Man,</hi> yet I have pleaded for a <hi>Great,</hi> a <hi>Valiant,</hi> and a <hi>vertuous</hi> people. Sir, I am.</p>
