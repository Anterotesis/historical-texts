            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>There ſhall come in the last daies ſcoffers, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after their own lusts, and ſaying, where
is the promiſe of his coming? For ſince the
Fathers fell aſleep, all things continue as
they were from the beginning of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE great buſineſs of Religion, is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
its Votaries to preſent duty by the awe
and expectation of future retribution: and
the particular deſign of the Goſpel, the
Doctrine of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is to oblige
to this, by the aſſurance and belief that he who
came unto us heretofore to teach his Law, will
come again to execute the ſanctions of it. Behold
ſaies St. <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 1. 7. <hi>He cometh with clouds,
and every eie shall ſee him, and they alſo which pierced
him.</hi> And he ſaies of himſelf, <hi>Behold I come quickly,
and my reward is with me, to give every man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as his work shall be.</hi> Rev. 22. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49312:3"/>
               <hi>Which weighty truth, tho abundantly eſtabliſht,
by all the miracles the types and prophecies that
attend the Goſpel, is moſt particularly enforc'd
by the two inimitable expreſſes of Divinity, our
Saviors Reſurrection from the dead, and his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion
into Heaven. Concerning the former of
which St.</hi> Paul <hi>remonſtrates, Acts</hi> 17. 30. The
times of ignorance God winked at, but now command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all men every where to repent: becauſe he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a day in which he will judg the world in
righteouſneſs, by that man whom he hath ordain'd:
whereof he hath given aſſurance unto all men, in that
he hath rais'd him from the dead. <hi>The other is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
by St.</hi> Peter, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 19. Repent and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
that your ſins may be blotted out, when the times
of refreshing shall come from the preſence of the Lord.
And he shall ſend Jeſus Chriſt, which before was
preached unto you, whom the Heaven muſt receive
until the times of reſtitution of all things, which God
hath ſpoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets, ſince
the world began.</p>
            <p>Indeed this ſecond advent is the foundation,
the ſupport and end of our Religion. <hi>If in this
life only we had hope, we were of all men moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,</hi>
1 Cor. 15. 19. If to the other Articles of
our Creed which concern our Savior, there had
not ſucceded the belief, that he ſhall come again
to judg both the quick and the dead, we were
as ridiculous as theſe mockers of the Text pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
us, hated and ſcorn'd by men, and deſerted
by Almighty God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49312:3"/>
It will therefore import us highly to examine
whether the Chriſtian be ſo abſurd a perſon as theſe
drols and merry men would make him, a creature
only uſeful, becauſe he finds them ſport and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment.</p>
            <p>And for a juſt ſurvey hereof, twill be material to
conſider,</p>
            <p>Firſt the perſonal qualifications of the Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
here deſcrib'd, and</p>
            <p>Secondly the force of their arguments and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſings:
according to thoſe two prevailing To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics
in uſe among us, from the head of Autority, and
that of Reaſon. And this being well deduc'd, twill
not be hard to bring the whole debate to a ſhort and
certain iſſue, both in regard of ſpeculation, and what
is more important in reference to practice.</p>
            <p>I begin to conſider what I firſt propos'd, the
perſonal qualifications of the Diſputers here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd.
They are ſaid to be ſcoffers walking after
their own luſts.</p>
            <p>To be a Scoffer is ſure no very laudable Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
being the joint reſult of Pride and Malice,
the doing miſchief, and the doing it in ſport. So
that whereas tis ſaid that the Flatterer is the worſt
of tame beaſts, and the Detractor of wild, the
Scoffer has the ferity of both. Amidſt the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to Urbanity, and being pleſant company, he
is the bane of all ſociety, <hi>the poiſon of Aſps is under
his lips, his teeth are ſpears and arrowes, and his
tongue a sharp ſword,</hi> Pſal. 5. 7. Any injury is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable,
that has not contemt and ſcorn ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49312:4"/>
to it; we can better bear the wounds, then
the inſultings of an enemy; or if we muſt ſubmit
to that, we would not have our underſtandings
trampled on; be run down like fools and Idiots,
or fall the victims of petulant ill nature, edg'd with
envenom'd wit.</p>
            <p>But as this temper is moſt injurious and unſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable;
tis alſo ignorant and indocile. The ſure
effect of knowledg, is an humble ſenſe of the want
of it: the deeper we immerſe our ſelves in any
Art or Science, the greater and more inſuperable
difficulties are ſtarted by us: and the ſame event
happens to all induſtrious enquirers, which befel
<hi>Socrates;</hi> to arrive at laſt to this one great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
that they know nothing. Tis the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
priviledg of the ignorant and half-wited, by
thinking well of their own skill and acquiſitions,
to make it impoſſible for them to have any. <hi>Seeſt
thou a man wiſe in his own eies,</hi> ſaies <hi>Solomon, there
is more hope of a fool then of him,</hi> Prov. 26. 12. and
at the 9. Chap. ver. 7, 8. <hi>He that reproveth a ſcorner
getteth himſelf a shame, and he that rebuketh a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man getteth himſelf a blot: rebuke not a ſcorner
leaſt he hate thee: rebuke a wiſe man and he will
love thee.</hi> and Chap. 14. ver. 6. <hi>A ſcorner ſeeketh
wiſdom, and findeth it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But farther, over and above the before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
ingredients, of pride, ill nature, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible
folly; the mockers of the Text are branded
with immorality and vice: to <hi>walk after their own
luſts.</hi> And ſure there cannot be a more prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49312:4"/>
impudence, then that the guilty and obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious,
perſons liable to the ſevereſt puniſhments
as well as cenſures, ſhould dare to awaken obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
by being ſharp on others. But ſo it is, the
man that walks in the <hi>counſel of the ungodly, and has
ſtood in the way of ſinners,</hi> will not fail to recreate
himſelf by ſitting down in the ſeat of the ſcornful.
<note n="a" place="bottom">ad Nicom. Eth. lib. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> truly reſolv'd that the ſenſual or paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
were incapable of receiving moral knowledg,
and tis hard that they who are not in a poſſibility to
be learners, ſhould take upon them to be judges.</p>
            <p>But in the preſent caſe tis their great concern
and intereſt not to be inſtructed. To convince the
ſenſual man that there is a future doom, is to ſour
all his joies, and torment him before the time.
So that to paſs all other grounds of prejudice,
whatever is ſuggeſted by theſe mockers of the Text,
their teſtimony at leaſt is not to be conſider'd, they
being brib'd and led aſide by intereſt to all that
they aſſert.</p>
            <p>And let this ſuffice to have bin ſaid of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
qualifications of the diſputers againſt a future
judgment. I come now to examin the force of
their diſcourſings.</p>
            <p>Where firſt, tis obvious to advert, that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
<hi>Where is the promiſe of his coming,</hi> is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly
made.</p>
            <p>As the Apoſtle ſaies, that <hi>hope which is ſeen is
not hope,</hi> Rom. 8. 24. ſo a promiſe perform'd is not
a promiſe, all its obligation is ceaſt. But tho our
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49312:5"/>
pacts and undertakings fall not under the notice
of our ſenſes, it do's not therefore follow they are
nothing. Upon this tranſient blaſt of emty air,
hangs all the entercourſe and traffic of the world.
If we will truſt altogether to our eies, and nothing
to promiſes and words, we muſt expect the ſelf
ſame diffidence from others; and ſo be enemies and
out-lawes to mankind.</p>
            <p>Nor is the delaying of performance a prejudice
againſt it. Tis true the morrow is to us a diſtant
thing, however ſuddenly expected: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<note n="a" place="bottom">Epig. lib. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Martial</hi> did not amiſs to enquire of one who
ſtill undertook for the next day, where his to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
dwelt, whether in <hi>Parthia</hi> or <hi>Armenia?</hi> But
with Almighty God, every thing however diſtant
it may ſeem, is actually preſent: and as whatever
really is, however contingently it happen'd, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
and neceſſarily is; ſo whatever he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd,
muſt certainly and neceſſarily be: nay ſhould
be reckon'd on as already don.</p>
            <p>But the diſcourſings of the mockers in the Text,
if they amount to any thing will run thus. All
things continue as they were ſince the beginning
of the Creation, therefore our Saviors promiſe of
coming to judge the world is vain and fruſtane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
The weakneſs of which reaſoning, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
effectually laies open, by deſtroying every
part of it. Firſt he denies the propoſition, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
that all things continue as they were ſince
the Creation: and Secondly he denies the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49312:5"/>
drawn from thence, Tho all things did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
it no way follows they ſhall for ever do
ſo; and that the promiſe of a future change will
not hereafter be accompliſht.</p>
            <p>As to the Propoſition, it is obſervable, that
the Creation of the world is frankly here acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,
tho it be to the evident diſadvantage of
the deſign'd Hypotheſis. If the world were once
Created, in that Act however tranſient, it has
ſhew'd its ſelf liable to the greateſt change, ſince
there are the ſame ſteps from not being unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as there are back again the contrary way:
with this variety, that it is eaſier to paſs from a
habit to its privation, then it was from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to advance into the habit: and therefore
as the Univerſe did not exiſt heretofore, ſo it may
likewiſe not exiſt hereafter.</p>
            <p>But the truth is, the Origen of the World is
a matter ſo notorious, that even <hi>Epicurus</hi> and his
followers could not over-look it; and thought it
a leſs abſurdity to make a caſual concurſe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes,
produce all the powers, the motion, the
beauty, and order of the World, then to imagin
it to have no beginning. And to this they were
induced not only by attending the chain of cauſes,
which in a ſucceſſion of finite beings, could not
be infinite: but more particularly, from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of thoſe evident marks of newneſs, which
appear every where thro-out the world; and which
are ſubſtantially urg'd by the Epicurean Apoſtle
<hi>Lucretius</hi> in his 5 Book. I mean, the growth of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49312:6"/>
Arts and Sciences, the plantation of Countries,
the date of Hiſtories, the Analogy of Languages,
and the like.</p>
            <p>But to paſs forward. Whereas tis urg'd by our
Diſputers, that ſince the Fathers fell aſleep, all
things continue as they did ſince the Creation, tis
obvious to reply, that all things do not continue
as they were, becauſe the Fathers are fallen aſleep:
the deſtruction of all preceding generations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a very remarkable mutation in the Univerſe.
For however by conſtant ſucceſſions the world has
bin ſupplied, yet ſince tis evident that all the parts
are in perpetual flux and motion, the whole which
is nothing but an aggregate of thoſe parts, muſt
needs be of the ſame complexion. So that upon
the matter the argument comes to this. All things
continue as they were ſince the Creation, becauſe
nothing continues as it was ſince the Creation.</p>
            <p>Tis true the World has laſted a long time, but
ſo have divers other things, which many ages ſince
have periſht, as alſo others which we ſee are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing.
Let us conſider artificial compoſitions,
for inſtance Buildings; whereof the parts conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
decay and moulder: and tho by diligent repairs,
the fabric is maintain'd ſo as to be habitable for
ſeveral Ages, yet at laſt in ſpight of all ſupplies,
it ſinks into a ruine. And thus it fares in that
other fabric of our Bodies, which we know are
liable to a thouſand accidents, every one of which

            <p>From the which inſtances tis eaſy to collect,
that in Syſtems of all kinds, whether artificial, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,

               <hi>Platonics, Stoics,</hi> and <hi>Epicureans</hi> alſo; and
celebrated frequently by the Doctors of Heathen
Theology the Poets. In the ſame manner we ſee
Priſons made ſtrong, and ſafely guarded, that the
Malefactors may be forth coming at the Aſſize and
goal delivery. And therefore upon a true account,
the preſervation of the world, is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an argument againſt a future Judgment, that
in reference to it, its fabric is kept up, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
continued.</p>
            <p>In like manner alſo, whereas ill men pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
much in their impunity; and becauſe they
have liv'd long without controul, think they ſhall
for ever do ſo; they have all reaſon to conſider,
that this ſucceſs is of ominous abode unto them:
their condition is the ſame with that of the guilty
priſoner, who is therefore fed upon the public
charge and carefully ſecur'd, becauſe he is reſerv'd
to be brought forth to Execution: when in the
interim the honeſt man is left at large, without that
care, or any notice taken of him.</p>
            <p>Tis true indeed God has beſides another more
kind intendment, when he indulges this impunity,
if wicked men would be receptive of it: they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are repriev'd, that they may have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to ſue their pardon out, and reconcile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to their offended Judg: for ſo it followes in
the context, ver. 9. <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49312:8"/>
his promiſe (as ſome men account ſlackneſs) but is
long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should
perish, but that all should come to repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this conſideration is of an aſtoniſhing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
that the beſt argument men can frame
againſt the exiſtence of Almighty God, and his
future Judgment, is that he is infinitly good, and
that he paſſes over thoſe indignities, which in the
opinion of the guilty Authors are beyond all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance.
They would not have him be a revenger
of their foul demerits; no more would he himſelf:
he would be a God to bleſs, to ſave and pardon, but
not to puniſh and deſtroy; and therefore, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as they are, they would not have him be at all:
and madly throw away their hopes, when they
would rid themſelves of fear. To ſuch a miſerable
iſſue do's brutiſh guilt engage; makes it the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of men that there ſhould be no Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to ſupport the world, or Providence to guide
it; no power in Heaven to bleſs and to protect;
and what is yet more deſperate, no mercy there
to pardon and forgive.</p>
            <p>But farther, ſuppoſe no promiſe had bin made
of a future coming to Judgment, it will by no
means follow that there will be none; or that ſuch
a dreadful, tho but contingent poſſibility, ſhould
reaſonably be laught at and contemn'd. Many
things are daily don by us which we never engag'd
before hand that we would do; and ſure tis equal,
that the moſt free agent ſhould be allowed the ſelf
ſame liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49312:9"/>
But laſtly, to make the moſt advantagious ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
for theſe Diſputers of the Text, that God had
ſaid, nay ſworn that he would not come to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
with what face can they, who frequently do
what they have bound themſelves by horrid execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
never to attemt, expect a greater veracity
from others then they exerciſe themſelves? Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſince in all things elſe they disbelieve Almighty
God, why ſhould they credit him in this? or if
they will let him be veracious in this one inſtance,
how are they ſure he meant in earneſt what he
ſpoke, and did not rally, as they love to do? Tis
certain the time will come, when he will tranſcribe
their practice, and in their fatal exigence, <hi>laugh at
their calamity, and mock when their fear comes:</hi> nor
can they eaſily be ſure, that he has not begun to
treat them in their own way already.</p>
            <p>Now all this being put together, can any thing
be more unaccountable, then that men ſhould by
ſuch ropes of ſand let themſelves down to Hell;
by ſuch pitiful inconſequences, which yet are the
beſt proofs the matter can afford, think they have
baffled all the expectations and fears, nay all the
poſſibilities; for nothing elſe can give ſecurity of
future Judgment?</p>
            <p>Yet ſo it is, theſe ſtupid Arguers have voted
themſelves to be the Maſters of Reaſon, and ſo they
are reſolv'd to be. A dull inconſequence, pointed
with a blaſphemous ſcoffe, in deſpight of Logic and
common ſenſe, is Wit and demonſtration to boot:
and all they that own an awe of God, a love of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49312:9"/>
Vertue, and fear of Hell, are fools and mad men,
and tis loſt labor to diſpute againſt it. Theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of the ſcorners Chair, are (if it may be) more
infallible then that of Rome.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not therefore any farther attemt to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive
them: but having thus unravel'd the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putings
of the Text in point of conſequence and
argument, I ſhall now take leave to look upon them
in another light; as they are a recital of a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and thereby offer to us a farther proof of all
that they propoſe: To wit</p>
            <p>The appearance of theſe ſcoffers in the World
who laugh at all Religion, and deſpiſe a future
Judgment, when ſo ere it happens, is its ſelf a very
ſignal mark of its approch.</p>
            <p>I stir up, <hi>ſaies St.</hi> Peter, <hi>at the beginning of this
Chapter, and the words immediately preceding the
Text,</hi> your pure minds by way of remembrance: that
ye may be mindful of the words which were ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by the holy Prophets, and of the commandment
of us the Apostles of the Lord and Savior: knowing
this firſt, that there shall come in the laſt daies ſcoffers,
<hi>&amp;c. To which St.</hi> Jude <hi>exactly accords at the</hi> 17
<hi>and 18 verſes of his Epiſtle,</hi> Beloved remember ye the
words which were ſpoken before of the Apostles of our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, how that they told you there should
be mockers in the last time, who should walk after
their own ungodly luſts. <hi>And St.</hi> Paul 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 1.
Of the times and ſeaſons, brethren, ye have no need
that I write unto you, for you your ſelves know perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the day of the Lord ſo cometh as a thief in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49312:10"/>
night: for when they shall ſay peace and ſafety, then
ſudden deſtruction cometh, <hi>&amp;c. All which is in the
ſame manner declar'd by our Savior himſelf, Mat.</hi>
24. 37. <hi>who ſaies that his coming will reſemble that
of the Flood, which fell upon a generation of men
as</hi> they were eating and drinking, marrying and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in marriage, <hi>and deſpis'd the warning and
predictions of</hi> Noah <hi>the</hi> Preacher of righteouſneſs,
<hi>as St</hi> Peter <hi>calls him in the fore-going Chapter to
the Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor may it be ſuggeſted, that the ſcoffing at Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and a future Judgment, is no ſuch new thing
in the world as to be any way remarkable, and
made the Character of the greateſt revolution that
ever was. For tho there have bin alwaies debaucht
and profligate perſons more then a good many;
yet to have them openly ſcoffe at Religion, do it
with aſſurance and impunity, is a thing ſo unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
as may juſtly ground the obſervation laid upon
it. Indeed for a <hi>fool to ſay in his heart there is no
God,</hi> is not without example: but for a Sect of men
to ſay it with their mouth, dictate it as Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
and for that be eſteem'd Wits and Maſters
of Reaſon, is utterly without the precedents of
ancient times, and an atchievment to commence
with the laſt dotage of the world: a prodigy great
enough to go hand in hand with <hi>the Suns being
darkned, and the Moons not giving her light, the
Stars falling from their orbs, and the powers of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
being shaken,</hi> mention'd by our Savior as the
prologues of his ſecond coming at the 24 of St.
<hi>Mathew,</hi> the place before recited.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49312:10"/>
As no Nation in the world however barbarous
has bin found to be without Religion; ſo none
has bin without a concern for it. By Gods law
among the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Blaſphemer was to be put
to death; and Levit. 24. we ſee that ſanction
by Gods particular command put in Execution.
Which ſeverity afterward obtain'd, even then when
the worſhip of the nation diverted to Idolatry:
for when <hi>Gideon</hi> had cut down the conſecrated
Grove of <hi>Baal,</hi> and deſtroied his Altar, Judg. 6.
his life was required as an expiation of the fact.
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> tho a Heathen Prince, thought
himſelf oblig'd to vindicate the honor not only of
his <hi>Bel,</hi> but alſo of the God of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and as we
read Dan. 3. 29. decreed that if any one ſhould <hi>ſpeak
amiſs againſt him, he should be cut in pieces, and his
houſe be made a dunghill.</hi> At <hi>Epheſus,</hi> upon the
ſuggeſtion that the honor of <hi>Diana</hi> had bin toucht,
<hi>the whole city was put into a confuſion,</hi> Act. 19.
and at the 17 we find St. <hi>Paul</hi> queſtion'd at <hi>Athens</hi>
for being <hi>a ſetter forth of strange Gods,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
would not have eſcaped, had the accuſation
run, that he deni'd the old. For in that place<note n="a" place="bottom">Suid. in Diag. Diog. Laert. Corn. Nep. in Alcib.</note> 
               <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agoras,
Theodorus, Anaxagoras, Stilpo, Protagoras</hi>
and others were on this account puniſht by ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments,
pecuniary mulcts and confiſcations, and
by death it ſelf. Nay what is moſt remarkable,
and particular to our preſent purpoſe, when <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades</hi>
had here in the jollity of a feaſt indulged
unto his Wit, and made ſport upon the Rites of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49312:11"/>
               <hi>Ceres,</hi> in mockery perſonating the Prieſt, tho he
was their General in a moſt important war, they
recall'd him home, who not returning, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd
his Perſon, ſeiz'd his Eſtate, and publicly
devoted him by ſolemn execrations.</p>
            <p>It would be endleſs to deduce this ſubject thro
ancient Hiſtory: all the perſecutions with ſo much
blood and fury rais'd againſt Chriſtians, are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
inſtances of this very matter; they all ariſing
from no other ground then the zeal they had for
their falſe Gods, and an opinion that Chriſtians
were Atheiſts and Blaſphemers, that mockt at their
Devotions, and deſpis'd their Deities.</p>
            <p>Now whether it be reaſonable for us, to have
leſs veneration and eſteem for the true God, then
they had for the falſe, and verify whatever was
ſuggeſted by the Heathen, it will not be difficult
to determin. But if after the preaching of the
Goſpel, wherein are made diſcoveries of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of God and of his mercy, beyond any vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaf'd
to former ages, men ſhall have leſs regard of
Him and of his Honor, and after that his Son has
for our ſakes expos'd himſelf to ſhame and mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery,
and become of no reputation, we ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
add to his inanition, and let him be of none
with us; converting all the obliging circumſtances
of his life and death to his continued reproch; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify
him afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame:
and farther, if theſe multiplied, theſe unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
indignities, which in former times had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
bin Capital, ſhall now become a Specimen
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49312:11"/>
of parts and education; be committed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
with bold inſolence, and by the Hearers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
with pleſure and applauſe; theſe practices
thus put together and enhanc'd, upon a ſober eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
muſt prove, ſuch as do carry with them as the
blackeſt guilt, ſo the moſt direful ominous abode.</p>
            <p>That this Age of ours has ſomwhat of mockery
for its particular Genius, ſo that ſcarce any thing
is ſo entertaining, as to ſport with the miſadven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
or failances of others; nor no faculty more
recommending then the being dextrous in turning
ſerious things to Ridicule, I think is a truth ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,
that I may ſay it without offence to any:
they that are paſſive in theſe skirmiſhes, being ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
ſenſible of what they ſuffer; and they that
are active, not deſiring to concele or diſown their
Talent: nay both ſorts at one time or other being
active, thoſe that have wit to ſhew it, and thoſe
that have none to pretend to it. Tho alas, what
great proof is it of wit, to make others laugh? which
an Idiot can do as effectually by having none: and
as to what is the height of that celebrated faculty,
and is thought true bearing wit, the ſaying ſharp
unexpected rambling things, tis moſt happily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
by an approch to drunkenneſs or frenzy;
and twill be no very advantagious barter, to looſe
our underſtandings to advance our wit.</p>
            <p>The<note n="a" place="bottom">Ariſt. Rhet. l. 3. Quintil. Inſtit. l. 6.</note> Maſters of Greek and Roman Rhetoric
in their Inſtitutions, diſcourſe indeed of <hi>cauſing
laughter</hi> as a piece of the Art which they pretend
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49312:12"/>
to teach: but they tell us tis only to be allowed
in thoſe cauſes which admit no other defence. The
Buffoon in a deſperate exigence is to relieve the
Orator, impudence to ſupply the place of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and wit fill up the room of ſenſe: as we ſee
men who have no better weapon, think it no

            <p>But what ſhall we ſay of thoſe, who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd

thoſe Schole divinity Drolls of this our Age,

with which twere not allowable to oppoſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil

good cauſe ſhould be aſſerted by ſuch arguments
as libel and reproch it; ſuch as cannot be urg'd
but by the worſt of Men, and which even they
will not produce, till that all others fail them. And
were thoſe flowers of Rhetoric weeded out of our
late controverſial books, we ſhould find large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes
ſhrink into Manuals, and be as little in their
bulk, as they are in their conviction. Where ere
this procedure takes place, tis not at all material
on what ſide the truth lies; a Jeſt will as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
provide an anſwer to a demonſtration, as to
the moſt manifeſt inconſequence. The brighteſt

this beloved acquiſition proves, be it the gift

the product of drunkenneſs or frenzy, or what is
yet a ſhorter method, of ſpight or malice, it has
a peculiar faculty to pervert the beſt and moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

for foppiſhneſs, order for formality, learning for

            <p>Theſe are the men, who, as the roial Pſalmiſt tells

honor of Nobles, the deareſt intereſts of all

not worth the keeping. Nay Majeſty its ſelf is
here obnoxious, treated as our Savior was in order
to his Crucifixion; arai'd in a ridiculous robe, arm'd

and bowed to in reproch, and then tis thought
high time to hang it on a tree. This leud familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
ends in the worſt contemt, and nothing can be
ſo unhappy as Autority when baffled. The Coffee-houſe
Rebell is more miſchievous, then he that

            <p>My preſent enquiry is after thoſe of a higher diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,

own luſts, proud as they are, and confident that
the day of Judgment will either never be, or is
far off; I ſhall not add more words upon that Head
to their diſturbance; but mind them of another
day, which they cannot deny to be approching, I
mean the day of Death, that <hi>ſentence of the Lord
over all flesh,</hi> as the Wiſe man calls it, which is the
day of Judgment to each particular perſon, as that
of Doom is to the World.</p>
            <p>And will theſe mockers ask in ſcorn where is
this promiſe of his coming? tho the Fathers are
faln aſleep, do they hope by a peculiar privilege
to continue ſtill, and reverſe the general law of
the Creation? If the long day of the Fathers had
a night who after 7, 8, or 900 years went down
to ſleep in duſt, and when they did ſo there was
no inquiſition in the grave, whether the date had
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49312:13"/>
bin ſo many hours, but all their labors vaniſht as
they did, in dull forgetfulneſs and ſilence; ſhall
our winter Solſtice day, whoſe Sun ſcarcely looks
over the Horizon, but inſtantly ſtarts back again
to dwell upon the other World, ſo lye upon our
hands, as if the Sun were to ſtand ſtill as it did in
<hi>Joshuas</hi> time, or to go back as it did in <hi>Hezechias,</hi>
that we might frolic it without diſturbance, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
riot and exceſs?</p>
            <p>The ſenſual Epicure deſcrib'd at the 12 of St.
Luke, who ſaid unto his ſoul, <hi>Soul, thou hast much
goods laid up for many years; take thine eaſe, eat,
drink, and be merry:</hi> tho he only overlookt, and
not deni'd a Providence, was ſtopt in his carriere
by haſty vengeance, which pronounc'd this irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible
decree, <hi>Thou fool, this night thy ſoul shall
be required of thee: and then whoſe shall thoſe things
be which thou haſt provided?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let our jolly men of diſſolute ungodly life,
who notwithſtanding the concerns of their immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
ſoul, are at leiſure to make ſport with every
thing however Sacred, who with ſcorn and greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
purſue unlawful pleſures, and bid defiance to
Almighty Juſtice, lay their hands upon their breaſt,
and ask themſelves at what enſurance office they
have ſecur'd a longer date of life: how they come
to know their ſoul ſhall not be requir'd: or if it
be, how well they are prepar'd to give an anſwer
to the queſtion but now askt. This very ſentence
at this moment is really pronounc'd againſt many
thouſands in the world, who ere to morrows night
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49312:14"/>
will breath their laſt; of which number not one
ſingle perſon that now hears me, is ſure that he is
not.</p>
            <p>Have they debated calmly with themſelves what
death is, how many unwelcome circumſtances
are hudled up in that ſhort word? Can they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
forego their houſes and eſtates, their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and their beds, and bid a long farwell to their
dear company, their paramours and flatterers, lying
gaſtly, and cold, and ſenſeleſs, impriſon'd in a Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin,
and immur'd in Earth? To ſpeak in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Scripture, will <hi>the tender and delicate
women, who would ſcarce adventure to put their feet
unto the ground thro delicacy,</hi> Deut. 28. be content
to be deſpoil'd of their <hi>rings and jewels, the change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſuits of apparell, the mantles, the wimples, and
the criſping pins, the glaſſes and fine linen, the hoods
and veiles,</hi> Iſa. 3. and, as he adds, take in exchange,
<hi>inſted of a ſweet ſmell a ſtink, inſted of a girdle a rent,
iusted of well-ſet hair baldneſs, and burning inſted
of beauty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not all, will they be willing to come
to the Tribunal of their Maker, and render an
account of all the words, the thoughts, the actions
and omiſſions of an ill led life? anſwer for their
noon-day inſolence, and mid-night revels; anſwer
for their own and others guilts: the ſin of their
rebellion, and greater ſin of their impenitence:
the accuſations of offended juſtice, and deeper
charge of ſlighted Mercy?</p>
            <p>Or laſtly can they after the confuſion and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49312:14"/>
of having all their guilts ſet in aray before
them, enhanc'd by the no leſs numerous overtures
of grace and mercy, out-brave that dreadful ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> Mat. 25. Will
they maintain the jolly humor there, and like the
three Children in the <hi>Babylonian</hi> furnace, ſing in
the midſt of flames, and reſemble them in being
untoucht by pain, as they ſhall in not being waſted
and devour'd? Will they find arguments of mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
and laughter, in the <hi>place of weeping, and wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and gnashing of teeth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they can do this, on Gods name let them mock
on, deny a future Judgment, or what is more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
and brave, let them provoke and dare it.
But if they cannot dwell <hi>with the devouring fire,
nor abide with everlaſting burnings,</hi> Iſa. 33. If they
cannot wreſtle with Omnipotence, nor <hi>have an
arm like God;</hi> twill be adviſable, to take a timely
warning, and according to the counſel given to
<hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 41. 8. to <hi>think upon the battell, and
do no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I ſhall cloſe all with the inference, and in the
words of St.</hi> Peter <hi>purſuant to my Text.</hi> The day
of the Lord will come as a thief in the night: in the
which the Heavens shall paſs away with a great noiſe,
and the Elements shall melt with fervent heat, the
Earth alſo and the works that are therein shall be
burnt up. Seeing then that all theſe things shall be
diſſolv'd, what manner of perſons ought ye to be in
all holy converſation and godlineſs? looking for and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49312:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein
the Heavens being on fire shall be diſſolv'd, and the
Elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheleſs
we according to his promiſe look for new Heavens,
and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs.
Wherefore beloved ſeeing that ye look for ſuch things,
be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſpot, and blameleſs: and account that the long-ſuffering
of the Lord is Salvation. Ye therefore, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you know theſe things before, beware least ye alſo
being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from
your own ſtedfastneſs. But grow in grace, and in
the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: to him be
glory both now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
