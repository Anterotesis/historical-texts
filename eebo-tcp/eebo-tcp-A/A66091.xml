            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

inherent to the subject, in their most proper
and essential Colours, Beauties, or Deformities.
Yet will we not so farre insist on the strict Rules of

(according to the true rules of his pattern, Nature)
so gracefully to over shadow the less decent parts,

which the choicest of essential similitudes cannot
exactly reach, wantig such forms of circumstances
as might enlighten the intention of the Deliverer,
restrained and obscured in a real Narration. It may
suffice to silence opposition, to alledge we find our

            <p>

From the freedome of this latter objected subject,
issues the objection of the last <hi>(Preposturous)</hi> in that
it is suppos'd the unprescribed Fancy, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

a liberty to rove, will suddenly contract extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
mixtures in her compositions, to form a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digie
in the civill frame, as formerly in the natural.</p>
            <p>To this conjecture we may make reply: That
no Absurdity can be imagined so irregular, which
may not meet a parralel in the occurrences of civil
Actions. Be it, that we should suppose the most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident.
Truth condemned for the grossest Errour:
That Wisedom should be confuted by Ignorance:
Integrity ejected by Hypocrisie, Valour overcome
by Lachety, Industry supplanted by Sloth, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
suffer by the Criminal, Justice smothered
by Iniquity, Love rewarded with Hate; which
without further proof to verify, I only, <hi>Madam,</hi> will
appeal to you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> own observation. If any shall aledge
such accidents to be but the effects of our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which guids us still to satisfie our sence, rather
than an infeasable impropriety in a civill usage,
which the licentiousness of the Art doth often fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure;
not to decline the smallest shadow of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
scruple; we shall in some example devest
the action of this pretended object, leaving the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
immaterial or void in any cosnequence
what ever. Can humane sence reflect upon a more
Preposterous transaction than <hi>That the Monarch of

Having thus briefly (as the capacity of our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
will give leave) discussed of the Nature of
our <hi>Subject.</hi> Order requires that we should next
insist upon the use <hi>Thereof:</hi> Whereon depends
the real worth of every Piece, in Nature or in Art,
which to pursue methodically, we should in course
unfold the several kinds thereof, in their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
as <hi>Odes, Elegies, Epigrams,</hi> and the like: But
since the nature of our present subject may include
them all, as several species under their proper gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
we only will adhere to agitate thereon, raising
our introduction from the first view of the whole
<hi>Frame,</hi> without distinction of the Parts thereof.</p>
            <p>If intercourse in civill commerce may conduce
to form the Judgement, compose the mind, or
rectify the manners (as none who hath receiv'd
impression thereof, can deny) no form of instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
humane reason can reflect upon, more suddenly
and more perfectly can attain thereto, than can the
well composed illustrations of a <hi>Theater.</hi> Where in
few hours we may take full view of such variety in
circumstance, as many Ages cannot represent; and
from the consequence of events collect such rules,
may guide our undertakings with successe to their
peculiar Objects. Whilst being uninteressed Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
only, are to us distinguished the secret source
of each Transactors purposes, whose actions leave
so sensible an impression of their Character in our
thoughts, that seldom in our own particular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
we encounter such an inclination, but that
the prepossession of their figure streight illuminates
our sences to disclose their Tract; whereby our
Fortunes, Lives, Liberties and Fames, are timely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
secur'd from secret Trains.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53783:5"/>
To yeeld a true allay to the distempers of the
Soul, no Art can form a fairer methode, than thus
to represent the wilde distractions of her irregular
motives, transported with licentious fury, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the giddy will, with violation to each strict
prescription, Outrage to it self, with the disasters
frequently ensue so stubborn a revolt from that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrior
light, should lend her dignity: if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of the figure may reduce the minde to a
more happy and decent Regulation of her facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
To which pattern was among the <hi>Spartans</hi>
introduced a custom to inebriate their Slaves, they
might expose their loose Demeanors to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
view, that such a loathsome spectacle might
imprint a lasting Detestation of so bruitish a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper.</p>
            <p>Nor yet to regulate our manners can the most
powerfull precepts form the Minde, so willingly
susceptible of her intended Object: If intimation
of the glory and successe of virtue may inflame the
Soul to noble enterprises; or the Infamy and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of Vice, deterre from shamefull practises,
which are the principall Objects, a well compiled
Piece still viseth at: or, seldome in the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
are omitted. First, in regard the minde is
here no way subordinate unto a more supream suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficience
than her own. Secondly, in that such forms
of Institution do pretend unto no servile impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the most materiall impediments, why the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick'st
guides so seldome meet successe in the
Intention of their elaborate prescriptions. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of this nature propounding no other object,
but delight, unto the Auditory, the sensuall minde
<pb facs="tcp:53783:6"/>
is easily inticed to view such spectacles, where left
unto the freedome of her proper Inclination, she
insensibly assumes a voluntary propension to those
forms are represented in the fairest Characters, with
an aversion to the impeachable.</p>
            <p>These are the essentiall uses of our subject; nor
yet are the Collaterall lesse materiall: as, The
Community of a Prince unto his people (at whose
peculiar charge were formerly erected such magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
receipts for publique Spectacles, either to
ingratiate himself with his subjects in a mutuall
participation of delight, as an endearing enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
from himself, or else to represent the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
by circumstance and issue of some eminent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
enterprise or treaty within his proper ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
or with foreign States transacted by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
or substitutes, unto the illiterate and orebusied
multitude: who usually want vacancy or capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
to peruse, conceive, or retain the sence thereof
under the tedious, abstruse forms of publique ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifests:
which figured in such Interludes were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
obvious, to their very children. A happy piece
of policy to inform with delight the meanest mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the civill frame in what he is concerned.
The means to our security becoming once to us a
mysterie, may justly by us be suspected for disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Furbery.</p>
            <p>To this advantage herein doth succeed the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
