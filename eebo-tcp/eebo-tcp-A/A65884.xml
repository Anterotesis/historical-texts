         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>To those of the</hi> Clergy, <hi>and of the</hi> Two Universities, <hi>whose Kindness and Bounty</hi> Francis Bugg <hi>boasts of, in his</hi> Pilgrim's Progress, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.</opener>
            <p>WHereas the said <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> appears highly to value himself upon the <hi>Countenance</hi> of some of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> in his <hi>Contests</hi> against the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> sounding a Trumpet of the <hi>Clergy's Kindness,</hi> and being <hi>very Bountiful</hi> to him; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Norwich,</hi> upon his Request to him, giving him a <hi>Certificate</hi> in his <hi>Recommendation</hi> (together with his <hi>Bounty,</hi> which he says was very Considerable.) Giving also this Account of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement he intended to make of the said <hi>Certificate,</hi> viz. <hi>I was minded to make Application to my Lords, the Bishops of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>the two Universities, and to some particular Clergy-Men. All which I no sooner asked, than he granted me; and it pleased God so to open the Hearts of my Lords the Bishops, and Reverend Clergy, that I found help in time of need.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These his Incouragements considered, this <hi>Epistle</hi> is therefore De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to you, who are concern'd therein. Friends, Do you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to <hi>promote Christianity</hi> indeed? You must use better Instruments for it than <hi>Fra. Bugg,</hi> the Author of the said <hi>Pilgrim's Progress,</hi> whose <hi>Progress</hi> is apparently <hi>from Christianity into Apostacy;</hi> from <hi>Truth,</hi> and true <hi>Charity,</hi> into <hi>Falshood</hi> and <hi>Envy:</hi> As hath been evinc'd in divers <hi>Answers</hi> extant, which he could never wipe off; and is also further manifest in the <hi>Sequel.</hi> 'Tis no small Offence to God, or Injury to Men, to encourage such <hi>Agents,</hi> as can <hi>Forge, Lye, Calumniate</hi> and <hi>Asperse,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of <hi>Contending for the Faith of Christ, and promoting Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; Profanation</hi> of the Sacred Name of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> in idle <hi>Romance</hi> and <hi>Fiction,</hi> is no small <hi>Dishonour</hi> thereto; I hope your <hi>Profession</hi> does not allow thereof, or of taking <hi>Liberty</hi> thereunto; as this Agent, <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> is proved to take very largely; and if you can either <hi>Connive</hi> at his so doing, or <hi>Indulge</hi> him therein, how will he and you answer it in the great <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Account,</hi> before the Tribunal-Seat of Christ, the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judge of Quick and Dead? What Account will be given for the <hi>Violation</hi> of these Two Commandments, <hi>Thou shalt not take the Name</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58909:3"/>
               <hi>of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him Guiltless that taketh his Name in vain:</hi> And, <hi>Thou shalt not bear false Witness against thy Neighbour;</hi> Both which he has notoriously violated in his forged <hi>Sermon</hi> in my Name, and many other <hi>Fictions</hi> and <hi>Forgeries:</hi> Do you allow thereof, or gratify him for the same? Or is it his own <hi>officious, heady Act</hi> and <hi>Device</hi> only? For what then have you been so <hi>very Bountiful</hi> to him, and <hi>Contributed</hi> such <hi>Considerable Sums</hi> of <hi>Money</hi> to him? Is it for his <hi>just Demerits,</hi> more than others, in devising how to bring <hi>Contempt</hi> upon the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> by <hi>Forgeries</hi> and <hi>Calumnies;</hi> Falsly forming a <hi>Judicature, Trial,</hi> ridiculous <hi>Answers, Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lory, Cage,</hi> &amp;c to scandalize honest Men, of good Report, as a Pack of <hi>Perjur'd Persons,</hi> (as in his <hi>New Rome Arraigned)</hi> for denying his <hi>Calumnies</hi> and false <hi>Accusations?</hi> How should ever Christianity be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by such <hi>Mockers,</hi> who act more like <hi>Stage-Players, Merry-Andrews, Jack-Puddings,</hi> &amp;c. than <hi>sober Christians,</hi> or Persons design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>promote Christianity?</hi> And 'twill be no <hi>Honour</hi> for you to promote or abet such <hi>Agents;</hi> but procure you great <hi>Disgrace,</hi> if you glory in such shameful <hi>Treatment</hi> and <hi>Abuse,</hi> as this of <hi>F. Bugg's,</hi> against us. Besides, it will be an Indication of your own <hi>Weakness,</hi> to manage your <hi>Cause</hi> (if not of the <hi>Cause</hi> it self) for you to be beholden to such scornful Agents to manage it. What may People think of you? Has all your <hi>Learning</hi> fail'd you, that you must needs contribute <hi>large Money</hi> to a busie Body, for his <hi>Scribbling</hi> against the <hi>Quakers?</hi> Never complain against <hi>Illiterate</hi> and <hi>Lay-Preachers,</hi> or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick Ministers,</hi> if such an one must be your <hi>Champion,</hi> who, whilst his great Pretence is to <hi>Contend for Christ and the holy Scriptures,</hi> can take Liberty to <hi>Contradict both,</hi> in <hi>Practice;</hi> if to <hi>Lye, Misrepresent,</hi> falsly <hi>Vilifie</hi> and <hi>Reproach,</hi> be contradictory to both; as we are sure, no <hi>Lye</hi> is of the <hi>Truth.</hi> And we are not only for <hi>Confessing with the Mouth the Lord Jesus, and sincerely Believing with the Heart, that God rais'd him from the Dead,</hi> (Rom. 10.) but also for a Christian Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, agreeable to such Confession, and Believing, as is <hi>unto Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;</hi> well knowing, that to make good <hi>Confessions,</hi> to speak good <hi>Words,</hi> and live bad <hi>Lives,</hi> to <hi>confess</hi> Christ in <hi>Words,</hi> and <hi>deny</hi> him in <hi>Actions,</hi> will not commend or prove any to be true Christians. The Sincerity of our <hi>Belief in,</hi> and <hi>Confession to,</hi> the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> the very <hi>Christ</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> (to whom all his holy <hi>Prophets</hi> gave witness) together with the Verity and Divine Authority of the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as being first given by <hi>Divine Inspiration,</hi> I say, our <hi>Sincerity</hi> herein
<pb facs="tcp:58909:3"/>
is known to Him who searches and knows our Hearts, however we be misrepresented in these <hi>Two</hi> main <hi>Points,</hi> by some ill-affected Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, <hi>perverting, cutting, mangling,</hi> and <hi>altering</hi> the Words, Sayings and Sense of both deceased and living <hi>Authors;</hi> which this <hi>Agent</hi> has been and is prov'd notoriously guilty of, as a Person not Consciencious in his Writing, and frequent <hi>Repetitions</hi> of the same <hi>Refuted Calumnies,</hi> still imposing the same over and over, without making Defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by any serious <hi>Answer, Replication</hi> or <hi>Rejoynder;</hi> his Course of Scribbling being to repeat the same <hi>Fallacies</hi> and <hi>Misrepresentations</hi> under divers <hi>Models, Titles, Forms</hi> and <hi>Shapes;</hi> as sometime to make them in Form of a <hi>Creed;</hi> another, in the Form of a <hi>Trial,</hi> in a <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Júdicature;</hi> another while, in the Form of a <hi>Dialo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue;</hi> another while, in the Form of <hi>Queries;</hi> another while, in the Form of <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> another while, in the Form of a <hi>Sermon:</hi> Together with his <hi>Scoff:</hi> and <hi>Jeers, Flouts, Boasts, Challenges,</hi> intermixt; and thus he can make up numerous <hi>Books,</hi> fill'd with <hi>Repetitions</hi> of the same Stuff, in divers shapes, without taking any serious notice of <hi>Answers</hi> or <hi>Confutation:</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his crooked perverse Manner of Writing, <hi>picking, mincing, clipping, forging</hi> and <hi>perverting</hi> Words and Sentences. Ill minded Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may easily abuse, and make the best of Writings look ill. And now, how bitter and envious, and how full of cruel <hi>Mocking</hi> this Agent is turn'd against us, the said People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and with what <hi>Contempt</hi> he hath writ, concerning the <hi>Light within,</hi> or <hi>in Man,</hi> and our Doctrine thereof, that his <hi>Self-Condemnation</hi> and <hi>Apostacy</hi> may therein the more appear, please to observe his own <hi>solemn Testimony,</hi> how expresly contrary it is to his present Treatment of us, the said People (as it is in his Book, stiled, <hi>The Quakers Detected,</hi> &amp;c. printed 1686. about <hi>Two Years</hi> after his <hi>leaving</hi> our Communion, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England)</hi> as 'tis in his own words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>The first Point under Consideration, is, how I came to be a Member of their Society,</hi> &amp;c. (i.e. of the Quakers) <hi>In the beginning they taught, That all Men were enlightned, according to</hi> John 1. 9. <hi>and that this Light, wherewith Christ had enlightned them, was sufficient, if obeyed, to lead to Salvation; and that it was the Work of the Ministers of Christ, to turn the Peoples Minds from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan to God: Affirming, That this Light was a sufficient Teacher, Leader and Guide to every Believer, without the help of outward Prescriptions, Forms, Orders and Decrees of Men: Upon these and the like Notions, I</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:58909:4"/>
                  <hi>became perswaded to make Trial of their Doctrine; and when I came to see and observe their Practice, Conversations and Deportments in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and what Simplicity and Plainness attended their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, I was still more Confirmed, that it was a Dispensation of the Love of God, sent as a Visitation to Mankind. And being thus perswaded, I was resolved to bear the Cross, and did utterly despise the Shame that attended them and their Message; and was not behind any of my Equals, both in doing and suffering for the Testimony thereof, as some amongst them can still bear me Witness: And in this manner we went on for many Years, and loved one another with Love unfeigned; and, doubtless, God blessed our Meetings with the Comfortable Enjoyment of his Presence,</hi> (p. 3.)</q>
            </p>
            <p>From which solemn <hi>Confession</hi> thus made by <hi>Fra. Bugg,</hi> after he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook our <hi>Communion,</hi> and went to the <hi>Publick</hi> (as he saith) it follows naturally, that he did not forsake us because of our Christian <hi>Principle</hi> or <hi>Profession</hi> of the <hi>Light,</hi> or because of our <hi>Doctrine, Conversation, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> or <hi>Meetings,</hi> or any Dislike had thereof; but because he deem'd us guilty of <hi>Apostacy</hi> from our first Principle and Profession; and that (by his own <hi>Confession)</hi> he did not thereby make his <hi>Progress</hi> from <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> appears by his applying to himself the words of <hi>Joseph,</hi> when in <hi>Egypt,</hi> viz. <hi>But (I) can say as</hi> Joseph <hi>did to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> Gen. 50. 20. <hi>But as for you, ye thought Evil against me, but God meant it unto Good:</hi> And Chap. 45. 5. <hi>Now therefore be not griev'd, nor angry with your selves, that you sold me hither,</hi> (Quakers detected, p. 8.) How came <hi>F. B.</hi> to apply these words to his <hi>State,</hi> when turn'd from us to the Publick, if he did not think himself then in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or turn'd from the true <hi>Light</hi> into <hi>Darkness?</hi> But we sold him not thither; he fled in <hi>Winter,</hi> when he had let in <hi>Unbelief</hi> and <hi>Fearfulness,</hi> because of <hi>Suffering</hi> and <hi>Persecution,</hi> which he had felt something of; but fell into <hi>Impatiency</hi> and <hi>Quarreling</hi> under it; and, having lost Sincerity and Truth, turn'd Envious Temporizer. And because he has so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and falsly charg'd the said People with <hi>denying Jesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> of holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> I may acquaint you with One or Two Passages more, which concern himself, as recited in my <hi>Answer</hi> to his <hi>New Rome Arraigned,</hi> entitled, <hi>Innocency Triumphant over Insolency and Outrage,</hi> printed 1693. p. 25, 26. as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to his saying, <hi>The Names Jesus and Christ are given to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,</hi> &amp;c. [True, but what follow?] <hi>Therefore</hi> (quoth <hi>F. B.) 'tis no Absurdity to say, It was not Jesus Christ for whom the Body was prepared; it was not Jesus Christ that came in the Flesh, but the Word:</hi> John 1. 1. <hi>(Apol. Introd.</hi> p. 3.]</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58909:4"/>
               <q>And yet he has confessed, it was the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God, that took the Body,</hi> p. 4. What Confusion and Self-contradiction does the Man blindly run into? And how contrary to the Apostle <hi>John</hi>'s Testimony is his Doctrine herein? See 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 2, 3. <hi>Every Spirit that confesseth, that Jesus Christ is come in the Flesh, is of God; and every Spirit, which confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the Flesh, is not of God; but this is the Spirit of Anti-Christ.</hi> What <hi>Spirit</hi> is this in our Adversary, which saith, <hi>It was not Jesus Christ that came in the Flesh?</hi> Who was it then? <hi>It was the Word, the Son of God:</hi> As if <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Word,</hi> nor the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> O horrible Anti-Christianism! And contrary also to that Martyr, Dr. <hi>Barnes</hi> his Confession, as cited by <hi>F. Bugg</hi> himself, p. 4. 5. viz. <hi>I believe, that without Man's Will or Power, Christ Jesus was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and took Flesh of the blessed Virgin</hi> Mary. <hi>Acts and Mon.</hi> p. 610. Now, <hi>If</hi> Jesus Christ took Flesh of the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> then it was Jesus Christ that came in the Flesh: <hi>But</hi> it was Jesus Christ that took Flesh; <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> 'twas Jesus Christ that came in the Flesh. Consequently <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Doctrine, <hi>That it was not Jesus Christ that came in the Flesh,</hi> is Anti-Christian, Anti-Apostolical and Contradictory to the said <hi>Martyr</hi>'s Doctrine.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In his Book, stiled, <hi>De Christianâ Libertate,</hi> Part 2. Chap. 1. he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth in the Name and Person of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> That <hi>we told them (i. e.</hi> the said People) <hi>that the Scriptures were good, and a true Declaration of those things, which were most surely believ'd by the Apostles, and by us ought to be believ'd; yet not the only Rule, but still the Spirit of God, which was the first Principle,</hi> &amp;c. And many more <hi>Confessions</hi> he has given to the Truth of our Principles, both with respect to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> his <hi>Light,</hi> and the <hi>holy Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I recommend you to the faithful <hi>Witness</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> in all your Hearts, which will Judge Righteously; and desire you seriously to peruse the following Treatise, and hear us in our <hi>Answers</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> as well as our Adversary in his <hi>Accusations;</hi> remembering that common Maxim, To <hi>Condemn no Man, before he be heard.</hi>

               <head>PART I.</head>
               <p>THE principal Notice I am concerned to take of <hi>Francis Bugg</hi>'s <hi>Pilgrim's Progress, from Quakerism to Christianity</hi> (as he falsly terms it) is, of his Chap. XIII. Entituled, <hi>The Quakers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,</hi> G. Whitehead<hi>'s Sermon, explaining their ancient Testimonies;</hi> (of above two printed Sheets) which <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> utterly denies, and in good Conscience solemnly testifies against, as a <hi>Sermon</hi> never preached nor owned by him; and which <hi>Fr. Bugg</hi> also knows in his own Conscience, is a Fictitious <hi>Romance,</hi> presumptuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd and invented by himself, to ridicule, defame and scandalize both G. <hi>W.</hi> and the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and their <hi>Yearly Meeting,</hi> which he calls their <hi>Convocation,</hi> and <hi>The Quakers Synod;</hi> also calling it a <hi>Sermon for</hi> G. W. <hi>to hold forth at their Convocation.</hi> He is positive in his <hi>first Title,</hi> that it is <hi>G. W</hi>'s <hi>Sermon;</hi> and as idle, self-contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting, and false in the <hi>other,</hi> that it is <hi>For him to hold forth;</hi> conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Sermon, but <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Forgery. And as the said fictitious <hi>Sermon</hi> is compos'd of base <hi>Forgery,</hi> ridiculous <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,</hi> foul <hi>Perversions,</hi> gross <hi>Lies,</hi> idle and sordid <hi>Stuff,</hi> with many curtail'd and abused Citations out of our Books; besides his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously Profaning the sacred <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God and Christ,</hi> and the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58909:7"/>
                  <hi>Light within,</hi> in his said <hi>Forgery.</hi> And that it may evidently appear such, I may recite some Passages out of it under the Title of <hi>Forgery,</hi> and shew,</p>
               <p n="1">1. His invented <hi>Cut</hi> of <hi>Pictures</hi> about a <hi>Table,</hi> to represent the <hi>Quakers Synod</hi> (as he calls it) some having their <hi>Names</hi> over their Heads, and others <hi>Deputies.</hi> And on the Table two Books Pictur'd, the one stiled, <hi>The Journal of</hi> G. Fox; and the other, <hi>Church-Canons,</hi> on the outsides: Which is a meer <hi>Fiction</hi> of his own. And in the same <hi>Cut,</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> (which he entitles, <hi>The Quakers Synod)</hi> he feigns <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> to say, <hi>Are the Doors shut?</hi> And <hi>W. Bingley</hi> to answer, <hi>Yea, the Doors are lock'd.</hi> And he feigns <hi>W. Penn</hi> to say, <hi>Call over the List: Are none of Truth's Enemies here?</hi> Then over one he has set <hi>B. Bealing, the Scribe.</hi> Which are fictitious <hi>Inventions</hi> of his own. And yet I heard, this <hi>Cut</hi> has been of a considerable <hi>Charge,</hi> to ridicule us with such a piece of <hi>lying Vanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He feigns me <hi>(G. W.)</hi> to Preach a <hi>Sermon</hi> in the said <hi>Synod;</hi> some Passages whereof do follow (with brief Observations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon) <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Forgery. <hi>Beloved, You see what great Mistakes are happened to this People of</hi> England, <hi>who by following the Doctrine of their blind Guides, have taken</hi> Matthew, Mark, Luke, <hi>and</hi> John, <hi>for the Gospel; that is, Glad-Tidings. No, no, 'tis</hi> Beastly Ware; <hi>yea, Dust, and Serpents Meat: And this I can prove by two Books, wrot by our Apostle</hi> George Fox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (p. 108, 109.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe.</hi> This is a horrid piece of <hi>Forgery;</hi> I never preached this <hi>Doctrine</hi> in my days, nor do I own it, but abhor calling either <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> or their <hi>Gospel-Testimony,</hi> or holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Beastly Ware,</hi> &amp;c. nor did I ever read those Expressions in any of <hi>G. F</hi>'s, or other <hi>Friends</hi> Books. And for this gross <hi>Lye</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, Fra. Bugg</hi> has been several times reprehended in <hi>Print,</hi> and yet still persists in the <hi>Repetition</hi> thereof; see my <hi>Sober Expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> p. 104, 105. and p. 67, 98, 137. and other <hi>Answers</hi> to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Forgery. <hi>Moreover the Scriptures are so uncertain, that it is question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, who was the first Pen-man thereof, whether</hi> Moses <hi>or</hi> Hermes; <hi>yea, either or neither,</hi> p. 109.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe.</hi> I deny this to be <hi>Part</hi> of any <hi>Sermon</hi> of mine, or ever so asserted by me; There is not only <hi>Forgery</hi> against me in this, but also
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58909:7"/>
a <hi>Perversion</hi> and <hi>Abuse</hi> against some other <hi>Friends:</hi> The <hi>Questions</hi> were not their own, but arose from some others; as evidently appears in their Book, entituled, <hi>The Quakers Refuge,</hi> &amp;c. p. 17. and 'tis <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd</hi> in my <hi>Antidote against the Venom of the Snake in the Grass,</hi> pag. 83, 84.</p>
               <p>Forgery. <hi>I still affirm the same, and do tell you, That it is according to our ancient Testimony; and you know, we cannot change nor alter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Unchangeable, as our Light within,</hi> p. 109.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> I utterly deny, that I did so tell them in any <hi>Sermon</hi> of mine, <hi>That we are as Unchangeable, as our Light within:</hi> This is not only a <hi>Forgery,</hi> but also a scurrilous <hi>Abuse</hi> of the <hi>Light within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Forgery. <hi>We our selves use many words not Scriptural; as these of calling the Scriptures Death, Dust, Beastly Ware,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Reason why we call them so, and translate the Words of Christ,</hi> John 5. 22. <hi>from the</hi> Son <hi>of</hi> Man, <hi>to the</hi> Light within, <hi>&amp;c. is, because we believe there is no other Son of Man, than the Light in us,</hi> p. Ibid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> Thus he falsly feigns me to Preach, and to repeat his own gross <hi>Lye</hi> over and over, of calling the Scriptures <hi>Beastly Ware,</hi> and as if we used so to call them. O Abominable Abuse! And I positively deny, that we so translate the Words of Christ, <hi>John</hi> 5. 22. as <hi>F. B.</hi> saith, as if we believed no Son of Man without us, but only the Light within us (which is as falsly Charg'd as the rest) though the Son of Man, which is <hi>Christ, the Son of the Living God,</hi> be the true <hi>Light;</hi> yea, the Light of the World, the Sower of the good Seed of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> in the World.</p>
               <p>Forgery. <hi>Notwithstanding we call the Scriptures Death, Dust, Beastly Ware,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> Note, Upon this often-repeated <hi>Falshood</hi> is grounded much of his idle and wicked <hi>Romance,</hi> which he calls <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s <hi>Sermon.</hi> Oh <hi>F. B.</hi> repeat this Lye no more!</p>
               <p>Forgery. <hi>Now my Friends, though this Confession be as contrary to our ancient Testimony, as Light is contrary to Darkness; as by our Books quoted you may see.</hi> [And what Confession that is, he relates just before, viz.] <hi>I believe with my Heart, and confess with my Mouth, the sacred Scriptures to be Divine, left us by Men inspired of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And I profess to believe in one only God, who is the Father; and in Jesus Christ his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son, very God and very Man; and in the Holy Spirit, one and the same God with the Father and Son, blessed for evermore.</hi>

                  <hi>Observe:</hi> Thus he represents me to Preach, expresly contrary to my known <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>Testimony,</hi> for the preferring and exalting the holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> above all other Books extant in the World.

Forgery. <hi>Friends, I am now come to the last thing propos'd to speak to on this solemn Occasion, and it shall be by way of Use and Application, for your Comfort and Consolation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>First, respecting Confession of Sin; shewing your Exaltation above the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Primitive Christians, Saints and Martyrs, and all the Christian Churches to this day,</hi> p. 114.—And p. 115. <hi>You being the True, Ancient, Apostolick Church of Christ, and as Quakers elected thereto,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>have no need to make any Confession of Sin in our Prayers to God; as our Practice for near Fifty Years does confirm,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Our Adversaries cannot prove from any one of our Books, wrote by my Self,</hi> G. Fox, E. B, F. H, <hi>Father</hi> Penn, S. Fisher, <hi>&amp;c. that ever we made Confession of Sins, and asked pardon for Christ's sake, nor that ever we recommended such a Practice to our Disciples,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now Friends, what Cause have we to rejoyce, and to magnifie our Light within, which hath led us to such a State of sinless Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> Thus <hi>F.

               <p>And my known publick Practice, both in <hi>Ministry</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> often times testifie the contrary: To the True Witness in all, who know me and my publick <hi>Exercise</hi> and <hi>Travel</hi> for the good of Souls, I do Appeal, to clear me in this Matter, against this Man's absurd and abominable <hi>Forgeries,</hi> which he terms <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>'s <hi>Sermon.</hi> And he goes on still with his <hi>Forgery,</hi> as my <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>Forgery. <hi>Now Friends, what a happy thing is this, that you need not trouble your selves with any Confession of Sins, since you are not like other Men, nor like these Publicans? And therefore I exhort you to keep to your ancient Testimony in all the parts of it; make no Confession of Sins, nor be sure you do not recommend the Practice of it by Word or Writing; but keep to our ancient Practice. Nor is there any need for our Hearers to follow those Christian Precepts,</hi> viz. And whatsoever you do in Word or Deed, do all in the Name of the Lord Jesus, giving Thanks to God the Father by him <hi>(Col.</hi> 3. 17.)

                  <hi>seen of Men, and seldom give Thanks at home or abroad, if alone; and that we so make Prayer to our Light within, as having our whole God within us, as safely as the</hi> Papists <hi>have their</hi> Crucifixes <hi>in their Pockets,</hi> p. 117, 118. This also is an ignorant contemning <hi>Scoff</hi> and <hi>Flout,</hi> as well as <hi>Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and a <hi>Slight</hi> also put upon the <hi>Light</hi> within; which though God and Christ is our <hi>Light, Life</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> yet we do not limit, nor confine him, as the <hi>whole God within us only;</hi> he being an <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresent</hi> and <hi>All-seeing</hi> God, whom the <hi>Heaven of Heavens cannot contain.</hi>

               <p>Forgery. <hi>My very Doctrine shew it to be the Ten Commandments, first, by telling the Priests, they might as well carry the Ten Commandments to Christ; the Consequence of which is, that Christ had as much need to learn them as we,</hi> p. 118.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> Though he unjustly makes this a part of my <hi>Sermon,</hi> 'tis none of my Doctrine or Preaching; neither are the Words mine, as cited. He refers to <hi>Truth Defending the Quakers</hi> (printed 1659. p. 18.) but falsly quotes the Words. I did not tell the <hi>Priests, They might as well carry the Ten Commandments to Christ,</hi> much less, that <hi>Christ had as much need to learn them as we;</hi> I disown such <hi>Blasphemy.</hi> But the Question being put, <hi>Is the Moral Law or Ten Commandments a Rule to the Christian's Life?</hi> The Answer was, <q>Thou might as well ask, if the <hi>Moral Law</hi> be a <hi>Rule</hi> to <hi>Christ?</hi> For the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Rule is Christ,</hi> who is the <hi>End of the Law for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;</hi> who came not to destroy the <hi>Law,</hi> but to fulfil it.</q> Therefore my Intent was not to make void (or to break) the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> or <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> but to refer them to Christ, the true Christian's Life, Way and <hi>Principal Rule;</hi> and that Christ is their Life, who live to him, is Evident; see <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>For ye are dead, and your Life is hid with Christ in God; when Christ, who is our Life shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in Glory:</hi> Now this Divlne Life of a Christian, which is Christ, cannot be under the <hi>Law,</hi> as a <hi>Rule</hi> to him, though the <hi>Law</hi> was our <hi>School-Master</hi> to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by <hi>Faith;</hi> but after that <hi>Faith</hi> is come, we are no longer under a <hi>School-Master,</hi> Gal. 3. 24, 25. <hi>And if ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not under the Law,</hi> Gal. 5. 18. Therefore being in the <hi>Faith</hi> of Christ, their <hi>Life,</hi> their Lord and Master, they were grown past the <hi>State</hi> of such <hi>Children,</hi> who were under such a <hi>School-Master</hi> as the Law, being no more under the <hi>Law,</hi> but under <hi>Grace, For what the</hi> Law <hi>saith, it saith to those</hi>

                  <hi>who are under the</hi> Law, <hi>that the wholé World may become Guilty before God,</hi> which his Children are not.</p>
               <p>Forgery. <hi>That we never recommend the Ten Commandments to our Hearers, that they should teach them to their Children,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This therefore may confirm you in our ancient Testimony, which hath been to lay them by as a dead Letter, Dust, Death, Serpents Food and beastly ware,</hi> &amp;c. p. 118, 119.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> This is not only a gross and repeated <hi>Forgery,</hi> as 'tis made a <hi>part</hi> of my <hi>Sermon;</hi> but also in it self containing two gross <hi>Lies:</hi> 1. That our ancient Testimony hath been <hi>To lay by the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> 2. As <hi>Beastly-ware, Serpents food,</hi> &amp;c. Where did I, or we, ever give such Testimony of the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> as to call them either <hi>Beastly-ware, Serpents food?</hi> &amp;c. I utterly deny (with abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) any such Testimony concerning the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all comprehended in that great <hi>Commandment</hi> of <hi>Love.</hi> And for me, or any of our Friends, preferring the <hi>Spirit</hi> before the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> the <hi>Gospel</hi> above the <hi>Law,</hi> and the Ministration of the Spirit and Life, above the Ministration of Death, and exalting it above the <hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> I know no spiritual Christian will blame us for that, or for any such Doctrine; which is so evidently agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the holy Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Testimony and Distinction in that Case, as between the <hi>Letter</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> between the <hi>Ministration</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> written and engraven in Stones, and the <hi>Ministration</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which was <hi>much more Glorious:</hi> As more largly he distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

               <p>Forgery. <hi>Beloved, I cannot but allow, that if the Scriptures were of greater Authority, than our Sayings, or that the Words of</hi> Matthew, Luke <hi>and</hi> Paul, <hi>were of greater Authority, than are our Sayings, I should be on the Christians side,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But</hi> Friends, <hi>in the beginning we were Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by</hi> G.

               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> This is a blasphemous <hi>Fiction,</hi> not only against the Holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> but against the <hi>Light,</hi> which he calls <hi>Your Light:</hi> For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the <hi>Light</hi> ever so Convince us to call the <hi>Scriptures Beastly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware;</hi> nor did I ever Preach such blasphemous Doctrine of the <hi>Light,</hi> as here I am grosly misrepresented, but the Contrary.

               </p>
               <p>Forgery. <hi>You may conclude, Friends, that he (i. e.</hi> G. Fox) <hi>was the Branch, the Star, the Sun of Righteousness, spoken of in Scripture; but mark, This (Epistle) it is only to go among Friends,</hi> p. 123.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe</hi> again: This <hi>Forgery,</hi> (which he now makes <hi>part</hi> of my <hi>Sermon)</hi> has often been detected, and charg'd upon him, as it is a very foul <hi>Abuse</hi> and <hi>Calumny;</hi> that either I, or our <hi>Friends,</hi> did so call <hi>G. Fox,</hi> the <hi>Branch,</hi> the <hi>Star,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> or preach any such Doctrine, as here he represents me. O Abominable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery! I yet challenge him, and his <hi>Abettors,</hi> to produce that <hi>Book</hi> or <hi>Epistle,</hi> of any of our <hi>Friends,</hi> which so terms <hi>G. Fox,</hi> the <hi>Branch,</hi> the <hi>Star,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Righteousness.</hi> For though I have found the words, the <hi>Branch,</hi> the <hi>Star,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> in <hi>E. Burrough</hi>'s Epistle, <hi>To the Camp of the Lord in</hi> England, (in his <hi>Works,</hi> p. 66, 67.) yet not apply'd to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> nor his Name so much as mention'd in that <hi>Epistle.</hi> And <hi>Bugg</hi> knows, he has been told of this <hi>over</hi> and <hi>over</hi> in <hi>Print,</hi> and particularly in my <hi>Sober Expostulation,</hi> p. 5. &amp; p. 54, 55, 56. but never had <hi>Answer</hi> or <hi>Reply</hi> from him, to clear himself in this Point (and many other Lyes) but a <hi>Repetition</hi> of the same <hi>Forgery over</hi> and <hi>over,</hi> like a wilful, impertinent, scornful Scribler, that will be still <hi>Imposing</hi> the same <hi>Refuted</hi> Calumnies, and odious Defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This is his course of writing and scribbling Books, with the same <hi>Abuses</hi> still <hi>over</hi> and <hi>over,</hi> without regarding any <hi>Answer,</hi> how plain so ever, to his <hi>Confutation:</hi> Which is a most silly, bruitish Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod he has enur'd himself unto, still <hi>Idem per idem</hi> for Proof, and that with a great deal of insolent shew of <hi>Confidence.</hi> And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, he has so much studied the Art of idle <hi>Romancing, Forgery</hi> and <hi>Detraction, Scoffing, Taunting, Flouting, Boasting, Cracking</hi> and <hi>Insulting,</hi> that he is arriv'd to a great Heighth of <hi>Impudence</hi> therein. For which I may repeat this one Instance: <hi>Twelve</hi> of our <hi>Friends</hi> in and about <hi>London,</hi> giving <hi>Certificate</hi> against <hi>four</hi> principal <hi>Calumnies</hi> and <hi>Falshoods</hi> cast upon the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> by <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> in his <hi>New Rome Unmask'd</hi> (as they are related in my <hi>Charitable Essay,</hi> p. 8. in 1693.) This being one of his four said <hi>Falshoods,</hi> viz. II. <hi>That the Quakers Prophets give witness to</hi> G. Fox, <hi>instead of this Christ; that they call him</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:58909:12"/>
(G. F.) <hi>the</hi> Branch, <hi>the</hi> Star, <hi>the</hi> Sun <hi>of</hi> Righteousness, <hi>and put the North of</hi> England <hi>for the Town of</hi> Bethlehem: Epistle to the <hi>Bereans,</hi> and p. 81.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Observe</hi> further: For our denying of this, and other <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies,</hi> in our said Twelve <hi>Friends Certificate,</hi> the said <hi>F. Bugg</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits a <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Judicature,</hi> feigns a <hi>Jury,</hi> pretends <hi>Proof</hi> out of Books perverted by him, calls the <hi>Certifiers</hi> against him into Examination; then forges their <hi>Answers,</hi> and counterfeits the <hi>Jury,</hi> to bring them in <hi>Guilty</hi> of <hi>Perjury.</hi> Then has a Form of a <hi>Pillory,</hi> and ugly <hi>Pictures</hi> to represent the <hi>Persons</hi> Condemned standing in it, and the first <hi>Letters</hi> of their <hi>Names</hi> over their Heads, and the word <hi>Perjury</hi> over them (as may be seen in his <hi>New Rome Arraigned, Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Bereans,</hi> printed 1693.) to the <hi>Scandal</hi> and <hi>Defamation</hi> of the <hi>Persons</hi> thus Reproached and Staged by him.</p>
               <p>By all which it may appear, what Proficiency <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> has attain'd to, in his Invention of <hi>Forgery,</hi> to Defame, and make Men Ridiculous: But when since he met with some <hi>Check</hi> for such his Audacious <hi>Abuse</hi> and <hi>Scandal,</hi> and might have cause to fear the <hi>Issue,</hi> then he could slily excuse the <hi>Forgery</hi> and <hi>Defamation,</hi> and put it off, as only a <hi>Mock-Trial,</hi> and a <hi>Mock-Pillory</hi> (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently a <hi>Mock-Sentence,</hi> and a <hi>Mock-Perjury)</hi> as if Persons may <hi>Defame, Scandalize, Steal, Rob, Kill</hi> and <hi>Murder</hi> Men, either in their Reputations, Livelihoods or Persons, and then (to excuse themselves from having their Demerits) alledge, That it was all but in <hi>Jest,</hi> or in <hi>Mockery.</hi> And so <hi>F. Bugg</hi> may say of his idle and profane <hi>Romance,</hi> which he calls <hi>George Whitehead's Sermon,</hi> that 'tis but a <hi>Mock-Sermon;</hi> and consequently that he uses the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> &amp;c. therein, only in <hi>Mockery.</hi> But this will not Excuse his presumptuous <hi>Profaneness,</hi> no more than his <hi>Forgery</hi> and <hi>Defamation.</hi> Have not some of the <hi>Priests</hi> own'd this Man for their <hi>Convert,</hi> even an eminent <hi>Convert</hi> of their Church? And do they not make use of him, gratifie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, as their <hi>Agent</hi> and their <hi>Tool?</hi> But will it redound to their <hi>Credit</hi> or <hi>Honour,</hi> or Promotion of the Christian <hi>Religion,</hi> to abet, promote and assist such a profane <hi>Scorner,</hi> to act for them in their Cause, more like a <hi>Stage-Player,</hi> a <hi>Merry-Andrew,</hi> or <hi>Jack-Pudding,</hi> than a Person of any Seriousness or Sobriety in Religion?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:58909:13"/>
                  <hi>Forgery.</hi> Again in <hi>G. W</hi>'s Name, <hi>viz. In the Application I have shewed, how our Light within hath exalted you above the Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, holy Confessors, and all Christian Churches, to this day.—Our dear Brother</hi> W. Bingley <hi>hath well remember'd our ancient Testimony against the Hireling-Priests,</hi> &amp;c. Benjamin Bealing <hi>hath found out a very suitable Hymn of Praise, even a melodious Song of Triumph; setting forth our Exaltation, and the Downfal of the Christian Churches, under the Notion of the False Church,</hi> &amp;c. p. 125, 126.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe.</hi> Thus he persists <hi>Forging</hi> such <hi>Stuff</hi> in my Name, and as my <hi>Sermon,</hi> like a silly <hi>Scorner,</hi> playing the Fool against me, to make me as ridiculous a Fool, as he can. What <hi>Stage-Player</hi> durst ever have adventur'd to profane <hi>Religion,</hi> and the sacred <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God, Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Light,</hi> in their <hi>Interludes</hi> or <hi>Comedies,</hi> as this Person has done? Who is accountable to God, for casting such <hi>Contempt</hi> upon the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as if it led to such <hi>Self-Exaltation (i. e.</hi> of our selves) as he has scornfully related? For such his <hi>Scorn</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> against the true <hi>Light,</hi> which we profess, he is Account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the righteous <hi>Judge</hi> of all; and his own more serious <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> to the <hi>Light,</hi> Recited in the <hi>Epistle,</hi> will rise up in <hi>Judgment</hi> against him.</p>
               <p>Forgery again, in the said pretended <hi>Sermon</hi> in <hi>G. W</hi>'s Name. <hi>I have also closed my Discourse with the Prophecy of</hi> Sam. Fisher, <hi>which you need not doubt of, but will come to pass, it may be sooner than you are aware of,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>only for the present we must be content to stay, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently bear: For as yet we cannot think, we shall be made to handle the Sword. But when the time does come, I have shewed you the Testimony of two of our Prophets, and early Champions, what we shall do, how we shall kill, cut off, and destroy, and bathe our Swords in the Blood of</hi> Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leck, <hi>and lay waste fenced Cities, and tread down the Honourable of the Earth, and spare neither Old nor Young,</hi> p. 126.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Observe</hi> his evil <hi>Design,</hi> by inventing and framing this in my Name, as <hi>part</hi> of my <hi>Sermon;</hi> as if I prophesied, that we should be made to <hi>handle the Sword, kill, cut off, and destroy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and spare neither Old nor Young,</hi> &amp;c. Which he would have understood in a <hi>literal Sense,</hi> to make me and our <hi>Friends</hi> as <hi>Obnoxious</hi> and <hi>Criminal,</hi> as he can; which bespeaks, not only an evil <hi>Design,</hi> but premeditated <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Injury.</hi> And I am apt to think, the Man <hi>Sinneth knowingly</hi> against <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Conviction,</hi> in taking up and representing such words in a <hi>literal Sense,</hi> as are in <hi>Sam. Fisher</hi>'s <hi>Prophecy</hi> to <hi>O. Cromwel,</hi> in 1656.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58909:13"/>
and in <hi>Fra. Howgil</hi>'s and <hi>E. B</hi>'s, in the same Year; <hi>S.

                  <q>Out of thee <hi>(i. e.</hi> the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England) Kings, Priests</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> did come forth in the Name and Power of the <hi>Most-High,</hi> which uttered their <hi>Voices</hi> as <hi>Thunders,</hi> and laid their <hi>Swords</hi> on the Necks of their <hi>Enemies,</hi> &amp;c. Gird on your <hi>Sword</hi> upon your Loyns, put on the tried <hi>Armour,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>My beloved Brethren and Fellow-Soldiers, make all plain before you, Thresh on with a Threshing Instrument, which hath Teeth; beat the Mountains to Dust, let the Breath of the Lord scatter it,</hi> &amp;c. p. 124.</q> Now that <hi>F.

Retract these bloody Books, and horrid Principles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon I would ask him, and those <hi>Priests</hi> who abet him, 1. If the <hi>Psalmist</hi> meant Literally in <hi>Psalm</hi> 149. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9? Let them read it at large; and therein <hi>Samuel Fisher</hi>'s words, concerning the <hi>Saints High Praises of God in their Mouths, and a Two-edged Sword in their Hands,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>Honour</hi> they have. And <hi>Isaiah</hi> 41. 15. <hi>Behold, I will make thee a new sharp Threshing Instrument, having Teeth; thou shalt thresh the Mountains, and beat them small, and shalt make the Hills as Chaff.</hi> 2. If he really thinks, our <hi>Friends</hi> meant, that God's <hi>Prophets,</hi> in this <hi>Gospel-Day,</hi> should go forth with outward <hi>Swords</hi> of <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Steel,</hi> and with an outward <hi>Threshing Instrument,</hi> having <hi>Teeth of Iron or Steel,</hi> and that they were therewith to <hi>beat down</hi> and <hi>lay level the great Mountains of Stone and Earth</hi> (some of them a <hi>Mile</hi> or <hi>Two</hi> high, as they are in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and other parts?) No, I cannot think that <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> believed thus Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, either of the Prophet <hi>David, Isaiah,</hi> or of our <hi>Friends,</hi> in the places recited by him for <hi>part</hi> of my <hi>Sermon,</hi> p. 122, 123, 124, 125. Therefore the more fallacious and deceiful he, to represent them in such a literal and gross <hi>Sense,</hi> to make us <hi>Obnoxious</hi> to the <hi>Government,</hi> as a People of <hi>Bloody Principles:</hi> Whereby he hath shewn, what a <hi>Bloody, Persecuting Spirit</hi> lodges in him against us.

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Confession</hi> of his, is, since he disobeyed the Light, and turn'd his back of it; otherwise he would still confess, that <hi>Christ,</hi> the true Light, the Head and Lawgiver to his Church, is above <hi>Scriptures, Fathers, Councils</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> and was before them, and is the <hi>Light</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> which whoever follows, shall not abide in Darkness, but shall have the <hi>Light of Life.</hi> Consequently this Light of His is a <hi>Guide</hi> sufficient to lead us to Salvation, and to Understand, Believe and Practice according to Holy Scripture, and not to oppose it.</p>
               <p>It is a wicked <hi>Calumny</hi> against our <hi>Silent Meetings,</hi> to say, <hi>That they were designed to wean us off from so much as the Remembrance of all External Religion, and also to prepare us to receive the false Notions of Quakerism,</hi> p. 5.</p>

               <p>He has unjustly quoted me, about the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> p. 6. as the <hi>Three Norfolk-Priests</hi> did; as I have shewn p. 16, 17. of my <hi>Just Examination</hi> (of their two Books) Entitled, <hi>Truth and Innocency vindicated;</hi> leaving out the very Explanatory Words, relating to the <hi>Spirits Immediate Teaching,</hi> being of greater <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Efficacy,</hi> than the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Scriptures, as divided into <hi>Chapters;</hi> my Explanation being, <hi>viz.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>I deny his Consequence, <hi>That any little Pamphlet of Our's, is of greater Authority than the Bible, or of as great;</hi> for I never asserted, the holy <hi>Doctrine</hi> in the <hi>Bible</hi> not to be <hi>first</hi> given forth from one and the same <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> from which we have given forth <hi>Writings</hi> and <hi>Religious Books,</hi> which contain many <hi>Doctrines</hi> in the <hi>Bible;</hi> and by referring thereto, they prefer the <hi>Bible,</hi> and the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the holy <hi>Scriptures</hi> contain'd therein.

                  <hi>F. Bugg</hi> his opposing the <hi>Light</hi> in the <hi>Body,</hi> to the <hi>Light</hi> in the <hi>Particular</hi> (p. 12.) is such a blind <hi>Contradiction,</hi> as well as <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinction,</hi> as is neither Scriptural, nor ever allowed by us; the <hi>Light</hi> (Christ) being but one pure <hi>Indivisible Light</hi> in himself, and in every <hi>Member,</hi> and in his whole <hi>Body;</hi> nor do we know of any <hi>Council</hi> held in <hi>London,</hi> either in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> 1666. or any Time else (of our <hi>Friends)</hi> who decided, <hi>That the Body should go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and the Light in the particular should submit to the Body,</hi> as <hi>F. B.</hi> falsly relates: But <hi>Mendacem oportet esse memorem; A Lyar hath need of a good Memory;</hi> which this seems to want. For in Contradiction to himself herein, he other-whiles accuses us with saying, <hi>All Power in Heaven and Earth is committed to our Light,</hi> p. 10 and <hi>That the</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:58909:17"/>
                  <hi>Light in every Man is the higher Power, to whom all must submit and obey; and that this Light is one in the Male and in the Female</hi> (p, 23, 24.) and <hi>their President</hi> (i. e. the <hi>Quakers President in their Convocation) being their Light within,</hi> p. 38. How then should the <hi>Body</hi> govern the <hi>Light?</hi> Or how should we make any such Decision, as he has told us, <hi>That the Light in the particular should submit to the Body, and the Body be without a Head, like a Monster,</hi> as <hi>F. B.</hi> Scoffs blasphemously! For <hi>Christ</hi> the true <hi>Light</hi> is our <hi>Light,</hi> and he is the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> and the Government is laid upon his Shoulders; who is <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> and <hi>King of Kings.</hi> And none can truly Perswade, Counsel, Judge, or (in such Gospel-way) Rule, or Govern for Christ in his House and Family, but in and by his <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> for no other is allowed among us, so that Christ in all things must have the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence.</p>
               <p>It is also an Impudent Falshood, that any <hi>Council</hi> among us <hi>Resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That</hi> G. Fox <hi>must be the Head of the Body,</hi> and not the <hi>Light</hi> in the particular (p. 11, 12.) Where have we ever so Concluded or Asserted? But ever the contrary; namely, that <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Head</hi> of the Body (the <hi>Church)</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Lawgiver</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>F. B.</hi> perverts my words, and wrongs me over and over, in saying, (p. 16.) <hi>So Proud is</hi> G. Whitehead, <hi>that he tells you, The</hi> Jews <hi>might as well have carried them to Christ in the days of his Flesh, (viz.</hi> the <hi>Ten Commandments) for him to learn, observe and obey them, as for the Christians to carry them to the Quakers to learn them, observe and obey them.</hi> (And to this effect he has many times over perverted my words, quoting <hi>Truth Defending the Quakers,</hi> p. 18.)</p>
               <p>Where did ever I say, <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>might as well have carried the Ten Commandments to Christ, for him to learn, observe and obey them, as for the Christians to carry them to the Quakers to learn them, observe and obey them?</hi> I deny the words and <hi>Comparison;</hi> and they are not in my <hi>Answer</hi> he refers unto; wherein my saying <q>[The Christians <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Rule is Christ,</hi> who is the <hi>End of the Law for Righteousness;</hi> who came not to destroy the <hi>Law,</hi> but to fulfil it.]</q> I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make void the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> nor render Christ to have as <hi>much need to learn them as the Quakers.</hi> Oh for shame, <hi>F. B.</hi> repeat these Lyes no more. I cannot but observe, what a Habit of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi> and <hi>Abuse</hi> this Adversary is arriv'd unto!</p>
               <p>Again, 'tis a notorious <hi>Abuse</hi> and <hi>Forgery</hi> in <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> p. 16, 18. to Accuse the Quakers with <hi>making the Commands of God, of none Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>

setting the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> (which he has fram'd, patch'd up and number'd) in <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Name, opposite one to another in <hi>two Columns;</hi> his Design therein being, to make the People call'd <hi>Quakers</hi> as ridiculous absurd and silly as he can.

So that his Conviction and Testimony for the <hi>Truth</hi> among the <hi>Quakers</hi> (even when he had deserted them) pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued him into the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> But now being grown more hardy, and so far hardned against <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> he can out-face <hi>both,</hi> and give himself the Lye in his fore-cited Solemn Testimony and Confession; as appears in his envious Contradiction following, in his own words, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Having by this time shewed first, how our Teachers, in order to bring us over to them, and to decoy us, told us, The Light within was a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Guide, Teacher and Leader, even sufficient to lead to Salvation; yea, above Scriptures, above Fathers, above Councils, and above Churches: I have in the last Instance shewed the Fallacy of their so early and smooth Pretences, and that from the beginning they have been a false, perfidious and treacherous Tribe of Deceivers, as ever the World produced,</hi> (Pilgrim's Progress, p. 15.)</p>
               <p>To such a degree of Hardness and Insolency is this poor Creature now arriv'd, that he can now thus scribble in Opposition to the <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of the <hi>Light within,</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> of the <hi>Ministers</hi> thereof, expresly contradictory to his own Testimony for the <hi>Light</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Christ hath enlightned Men) and to the <hi>Sufficiency</hi> thereof, if obey'd, to lead to Salvation <hi>(without the help of Decrees of Men:)</hi> And to his own Testimony also, for the <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Plainness which attended our Ministry;</hi> which did not import any Design to <hi>decoy</hi> or <hi>deceive</hi> Men, nor any <hi>Falshood, Perfidiousness</hi> or <hi>Treachery,</hi> as <hi>F. B.</hi> has falsly and treacherously Scandalized Us and our <hi>Ministry,</hi> and thereby notoriously given himself the Lye, and shamefully Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed his own Conscience, and solemn Confession and Testimony, in his <hi>Quakers Detected</hi> aforesaid. And the <hi>Light,</hi> now so much slighted by him, will pursue him (as it did <hi>Judas,</hi> and other Apostates) to his great Vexation and perpetual Torment, if he persists in his <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, Perfidiousness</hi> and <hi>Treachery</hi> against the Light, and the Children of it. Oh <hi>F. B!</hi> If I may yet perswade thee, Repeat thy Lyes and Scandals no more.</p>

His Accusation against <hi>W. Mead, That he said to one</hi> W. Harris, <hi>I will give thee one of</hi> George Fox<hi>'s Journals, it is a very good Book, yea, better than the Bible:</hi> Which Accusation he has many times over (p. 22, 23, 24, 25, 29.) but various in it, <hi>viz. That 'tis better than the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Prophets and Apostles,</hi> p. 23. This Accusation <hi>W. Mead</hi> positively denies, as contrary to his Principle, which is to prefer the <hi>holy Scriptures before all other Books in the World:</hi> For I asked him se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously about this matter. And I am sure, it is a base and shameful Abuse of <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> that <hi>It is the Heart of</hi> Quakerism, <hi>in saying,</hi> G. Fox<hi>'s Journal is better than the Bible,</hi> p. 23. This, I must tell him, is a foul, notorious <hi>Lye</hi> and <hi>Calumny</hi> against the <hi>Quakers</hi> (so called) 'Tis neither the <hi>Quakers Mind, Heart</hi> nor <hi>Mouth,</hi> so to speak, but the contrary, <hi>i. e.</hi> To prefer the <hi>Bible</hi> to all other <hi>Books</hi> extant in the World, as hath been often testified. Wherefore <hi>F. B.</hi> repeat this Lye no more against us.</p>
               <p>Again, as 'tis <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s common Course to add one <hi>Calumny</hi> after another, and to accumulate <hi>Lyes</hi> and <hi>Perversions</hi> upon us, he falsly saith, <hi>The Quakers stand upon the same bottom (i. e,</hi> with the <hi>Jesuites) and therefore they ought to distrust them in all they say, as the Protestants did the Jesuites.</hi> We do not expect he will <hi>trust</hi> us, who has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed his own <hi>Conscience, Conviction</hi> and <hi>Testimony,</hi> as before evinced. And to add to his Iniquity, and aggravate his Calumnies against me, he saith, <hi>Many of their Hearers, of the honest sort, begin to think</hi> G. Whitehead <hi>little better than a</hi> Jesuite <hi>already; he hath been so False in Fact, such a Glosser and Defender of every Error the Quakers hold: I have</hi> (quoth he) <hi>a Letter by me, which my Cousin</hi> Ann Docwra <hi>sent me, dated</hi> 26. 12th <hi>Month,</hi> 1682. <hi>viz.</hi> G. Whitehead <hi>has sent me one of his Books,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I was asked by an honest Friend, If he was not a Jesuite? I answered, Nay, it is not solid enough for them to own, especially when they write to a solid People</hi> (with more Reflections in her Name.) And then, to defame me, he infers, viz. <hi>Thus it appears, how long the honest sort of Quakers have taken</hi> G. W. <hi>to be little better than a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite, and my Cousin</hi> Docwra <hi>was of the same mind too, else she would not have given me her honest Friends Judgment,</hi> p. 25. I leave <hi>A. D.</hi> to answer for her self in this matter, she knows me better. But for this Defamation, of being <hi>little better than a Jesuite,</hi> thus insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated against me by <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> he is Accountable, as he is for his <hi>Trial, Condemnation</hi> and <hi>Pillory,</hi> forged against us under the Pretence of <hi>Perjury,</hi> and as a <hi>Pack of Perjur'd Persons;</hi> making no Conscience
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58909:19"/>
how Criminal and Scandalous he renders us, and highly defames us. But I challenge him and his Abettors, to manifest and produce those <hi>many of our Hearers, of the honest sort, who either begin to think, or have taken</hi> G. Whitehead <hi>to be little better than a Jesuite:</hi> Let him bring forth and manifest that <hi>honest sort of Quakers,</hi> that so think, or have taken me to be such an one; for I utterly deny the Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a false Aspersion and Defamation. As I also testifie against his other <hi>Calumnies,</hi> as these following, viz. <hi>That</hi> G. W. <hi>can vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate or excuse any Blasphemy, Idolatry, Contempt of the Scriptures, Contempt of Magistrates, of the Ministry, the Person and Sufferings of Christ,</hi> &amp;c. p. 26. I am not conscious to my self of any such <hi>Vindication</hi> or <hi>Contempt,</hi> but have often testified the contrary in publick, both in behalf of the holy <hi>Scriptures, Magistracy, Christ's Ministry,</hi> his <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Sufferings;</hi> and abundantly answered the same in Print. Wherefore <hi>(F. B.)</hi> repeat these foul Slanders no more.</p>
               <p>'Tis a wonder <hi>F. B.</hi> should so much, by Insinuation, endeavour to represent <hi>G. W.</hi> like a <hi>Jesuit,</hi> or <hi>little better,</hi> and yet upbraid him, as one so <hi>Illiterate, that neither writes true School-Learning, nor one Page good Grammar-English, as well as some part meer Non-sense (i. e.</hi> in Jacob <hi>found in a Desert Land.)</hi> Yet he will not call him <hi>Fool, nor yet nothing of a Schollar, for perhaps he might be then enter'd in his Accidence,</hi> p. 30. Thus <hi>F. B.</hi> upbraids and detracts against <hi>G. W.</hi> but to exalt his own Endowments, as having <hi>both a Competency of Learning, and Judgment afforded him to deal with the Quakers</hi> (p. 30.) 'Tis a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I should be such a <hi>Proficient</hi> in Learning now, as to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a <hi>Jesuit,</hi> seeing I never went to <hi>Learn</hi> at <hi>School,</hi> since the time I writ that which he deems so <hi>foreign to true School-Learning, or good Grammar-English;</hi> although I <hi>learned</hi> a considerable time after I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd my <hi>Accidence.</hi> But I am sure, all his Writings are not true <hi>Syntax,</hi> nor true <hi>Concord,</hi> but sometimes both <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Number</hi> confounded. But how comes <hi>F. B.</hi> such a <hi>Proficient</hi> in his <hi>Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of Learning</hi> now? When in his <hi>New Rome Unmask'd</hi> (in his <hi>Apology)</hi> he more submissively confesses thus, viz. <hi>I am not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd with Parts and Learning sufficient to grapple with such</hi> Scholars, <hi>as are some of the Chieftains of the Quakers.</hi>

                  <hi>as much in Three Months time, nay, much more, than the publick Ministry have cost me this Fifteen Years</hi> (p. 24.)</p>
               <p>I do not know what Account he keeps of the <hi>Charge</hi> our <hi>Ministry</hi> has put him to; yet I do not believe, his <hi>Hospitality</hi> to any of them made him either <hi>Break</hi> or <hi>Fail</hi> in the World: However he is very apt, not only to sound a <hi>Trumpet</hi> of his <hi>Hospitality,</hi> but also to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid such as he has afforded any <hi>Entertainment</hi> at his <hi>House,</hi> in the time of his Prosperity, among the People called <hi>Quakers;</hi> as he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided me in Print, with his <hi>Entertainment</hi> of me: To which I gave him this Answer, <q>As for being <hi>Fed</hi> at <hi>F. B</hi>'s <hi>Table,</hi> I think 'twas not very often, whether Three or Four times I remember not (which was but seldom in 25 Years time) and I suppose it was not without some Invitations by him.

But is it not to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, that the great Joy of some of them, over such a <hi>Convert,</hi> or <hi>Proselyte,</hi> might save him that <hi>Cost</hi> or <hi>Charge,</hi> which otherwise they might have put him to, under such a <hi>Chargeable Ministry?</hi>

               <p>Herein <hi>F.

thus foolishly runs on to form <hi>History</hi> upon false <hi>Suggestions,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly to make our innocent <hi>Meetings Obnoxious to the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon which <hi>Falshood</hi> he further goes on, pretending to shew, how our <hi>Six Weeks Meeting</hi> is <hi>Authorized</hi> by an Anniversary <hi>Epistle,</hi> printed 1693. which he recites part of, in which Recital of his, are these words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>And being sensible of the great Care of the <hi>[Six Week] Meeting for Sufferings, still leave it to the said Meeting for Sufferings to continue their Care,</hi> &amp;c. p. 66.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> Thus he runs on headily in his <hi>Falshood</hi> and <hi>Forgery;</hi> for the words <hi>[Six Week]</hi> are not in the <hi>Yearly Epistle</hi> and place quoted by him, of 1693.</p>
               <p>To his often quoting <hi>William Rogers</hi> against us, and against me in particular, as if he were of great <hi>Authority</hi> with him, I shall say little now, but am sorry, for <hi>W.

However I have cause charitably to hope, that <hi>W.

B.</hi> and his present <hi>Abettors,</hi> or now to <hi>compare</hi> us with <hi>Rome,</hi> or deem us <hi>Rome</hi>'s <hi>Sister, &amp;c.</hi> as p. 57.</p>
               <p>And his <hi>Commendation</hi> for <hi>G. Keith,</hi> and quoting him so often against us, and upbraiding <hi>G. W.</hi> with what he wrote lately to him, that <hi>G.

K</hi>'s Reputation, nor redound to his <hi>Esteem</hi> in the Eyes of any Sincere, Consciencious <hi>Friends</hi> among us, or Friendly People towards us. But his intimacy with <hi>F.

               <p>There is one remarkable and severe Quotation, which <hi>F. Bugg</hi> seems to Summon me, as the Author of—<hi>viz.

And again, That <hi>they refuse to pray for King</hi> William III. p. 80.

That many of the People called <hi>Quaker's,</hi> both Ministers and others, drew up a Paper against Hellish Plots, and Traiterous Conspiracies, as Works of the Devil and Darkness, even since the late <hi>Plots</hi> against the present <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> as well as against all <hi>Plots</hi> and <hi>Conspiracies</hi> in the time of the preceding Kings Reigns, may be truly declared; though, like a furious Incendiary, <hi>F. B.</hi> eagerly endeavours to stir up <hi>Jealousie</hi> in the <hi>Government,</hi> not only against particular Persons, but against Us, who are (and I hope, ever shall be) a People In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and Quiet in the Land, whatever mischievous Devices are, by such Incendiaries and wicked Ones, devised against us. Only he has done us some Right, in reciting the Ancient Testimony and Principle of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> renewed, with respect to the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Government, Against all Plotting Conspiracies, and contriving In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrections, against the King or the Government, and against all Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, Barbarous and Murtherous Designs, as Works of the Devil and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> &amp;c. p. 93.</p>
               <p>But <hi>F. B.</hi> has devised a false Information again, <hi>That at their Second-Day Meeting,</hi> March 23. 1695/6. <hi>their Teachers assembled together, and no doubt, great Consultings there were, and particularly about these words, Lawful and Rightful King,</hi> p. 92.</p>
               <p>What Ground has he for <hi>[No Doubt]</hi> in this Case? I know no such Consultings among our Teachers, or that they assembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to consult about those words. Thus <hi>F. B.</hi> vents his own false Imaginations, to expose us to the Displeasure of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> if he could. But, thanks be to God, <hi>F. B.</hi> and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates are disappointed of their invidious Designs and Ends. And suppose the Name of King <hi>William</hi> was not mentioned in the said <hi>Testimony,</hi> (yet in p. 95, 96, it is twice mentioned in another, as 'tis recited by himself) and there is enough in it to shew, that King <hi>William</hi> was really intended, particularly in these words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>And we sincerely Bless God, and are heartily Thankful to the King and Government for the Liberty and Priviledges we enjoy under them by Law; esteeming it our Duty to be true and faithful to them.</q> Whereby we could mean no other <hi>King</hi> than K. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> III. because no other <hi>King</hi> confirmed to us that <hi>Liberty</hi> by <hi>Law,</hi> which now we enjoy, as that of our <hi>Consciences,</hi> in the free Exercise of Religion and Worship, as we are perswaded of God. However this <hi>Toleration</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi> legally Confirmed, appears greatly grudged by our <hi>Persecutors,</hi> such as <hi>F.

                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:58909:23"/>
who are his <hi>Abettors.</hi> For in opposition thereunto he assumes the Boldness to promote in <hi>Print,</hi> an <hi>Abstract</hi> of <hi>Two Letters</hi> from <hi>Two worthy Clergy-Men</hi> (as he calls them) to their Acquaintance in the City, wherein (as related by him) is this Passage, viz. <hi>I pray God open the Eyes of our Governours, and cause them to take into Consideration this too much and too deplorable, unlimited and unbounded Toleration (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as the Quakers both claim and use it) which, notwithstanding all the Care and Indefatigable Labour and Pains of the Watchmen of</hi> Israel, <hi>will certainly (if not timely prevented) be the Overthrow of our Church, and Christianity it self,</hi> &amp;c. p. 84, 85.</p>
               <p>Was it not a piece of <hi>Insolent Confidence,</hi> to expose this in <hi>Print,</hi> and thus openly to oppose the <hi>Liberty granted and legally Confirmed by the King and Parliament,</hi> and thus to render our <hi>Governours Blind</hi> in allowing it, and praying God to <hi>open their Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. and inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against this <hi>Liberty,</hi> as <hi>too much and too deplorable, unlimitted and unbounded?</hi> Are not these bold <hi>Aspersions,</hi> reflecting on the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> of both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> to term the said Liberty <hi>Deplorable?</hi> &amp;c. But why so? The <hi>Watchmen</hi> are afraid it should be the <hi>Overthrow of their Church;</hi> they should rather have said, <hi>Of their gainful Trade:</hi> For their former <hi>Severities</hi> and <hi>Persecutions</hi> against Consciencious <hi>Dissenters</hi> (which now it seems some of them would have renew'd again) have been more Prejudicial and Injurious to Them and their <hi>Church,</hi> than ever either the <hi>Toleration</hi> was, or any <hi>Moderation</hi> or <hi>Lenity</hi> shewn by the <hi>more Moderate</hi> among them; there being many now ashamed of <hi>Persecution,</hi> that were formerly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it.</p>
               <p>To his Accusing me with <hi>Malice,</hi> and calling me <hi>Mercenary White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> (p. 98. Margent.) This is like the rest of his scornful, abusive and false <hi>Detractions:</hi> But I shall not need to insist much further on <hi>Bugg</hi>'s Abuse and gross Scandals cast upon Me, and many of Us, to Reproach the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> with his invented <hi>Figures,</hi> as that of a <hi>Pillory, The Quakers Synod,</hi> and his <hi>Cage,</hi> to represent us among every <hi>unclean</hi> and <hi>hateful Bird,</hi> as in <hi>Babylon,</hi> with 34 Names in it, set cross-wise, p. 130.

It is a loud and horrid <hi>Calumny</hi> to say, <hi>That we are in a most Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Plot against the Christian Religion,</hi> p. 166, 167. When we seek daily to promote it, in its Purity, both in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice, Life</hi> and <hi>Conversation:</hi> For it stands not in empty <hi>Talk,</hi> and barren <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</hi> And as foul a <hi>Calumny</hi> it is against the People called Quakers, <hi>That such Hellish and Damnable Plot is the main Business of their whole Body, in their Convocations, both in their Monthly, Quarterly, Six-Week, Second-Day and Yearly Meetings, which</hi> (he saith) <hi>ought to be taken Care of, at least Inspected,</hi> p. 168.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Poor</hi> among us, if they understood these his wicked <hi>Invectives</hi> against our said <hi>Meetings,</hi> might see cause to Exclaim against this <hi>Incendiary,</hi> for seeking to <hi>Incense</hi> the <hi>Government</hi> against those very <hi>Meetings,</hi> wherein our <hi>Poor</hi> are taken Care of; as in the most of the said <hi>Meetings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for the <hi>Growth</hi> of what he calls <hi>Quakerism,</hi> which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites all Christians to <hi>take Care of,</hi> he undertakes to <hi>prescribe Methods to prevent it:</hi> Wherein he presumes to dictate to <hi>Authority</hi> such <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions</hi> and <hi>Limitations,</hi> as he and his Two or Three <hi>Norfolk-Priests</hi> have aim'd at, in Soliciting their late <hi>Petitions</hi> to the <hi>Parliament;</hi> and yet Hypocritically pretends, he <hi>would not have us persecuted;</hi> he <hi>would not have the Government fall upon us to destroy us; no, by no means, he would not be understood so: For</hi> (quoth he) <hi>this I solemnly declare in the Fear of God, and as I hope for Mercy at the great Day of Account, when both they and I shall appear before the great Tribunal, I do desire neither;</hi> (i. e. <hi>Fire from Heaven to consume them, nor the Government to fall upon them,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>I would not have a Hair of their Head hurt,</hi> p. 169.</p>
               <p>Has not <hi>F.

O horrid <hi>Falshood, Hypocrisie</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> that a Person should thus presumptuously <hi>Swear,</hi> with <hi>Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> included, <hi>As he hopes for Mercy at the great Day,</hi> he <hi>desires not</hi> our <hi>Destruction;</hi> he <hi>would not have a Hair of our Head hurt;</hi> yet would have our said <hi>Meetings</hi> put by, which are to promote Christian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the Exercise and Practice of pure Religion and Christianity, (and wherein we have Divine Worship also) and yet he reckons <hi>Suffering the ready way to increase them, (i. e.</hi> the Quakers) <hi>for they</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:58909:24"/>
                  <hi>glory in nothing more</hi> (saith he) <hi>than to be thought great Sufferers,</hi> (p. Ibid.) So that he pretends to be against that Cause: <hi>No</hi> (saith he) <hi>let them have Liberty in their Licensed Meeting-Houses, to preach, pray, and exercise their Talent, equal with others, if the Government think fit,</hi> (p. Ibid.) So that these are no Meetings to carry on any horrid Plot; they are Licensed Meeting-Houses to preach, pray, and exercise our Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in. But <hi>F. B.</hi> does not think fit we should have our <hi>Monthly, Quarterly Meetings,</hi> &amp;c. though they be in the same Meeting-Houses, and have both Preaching, Praying, and Exercising our Spiritual Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in them; as also our Care of the Poor, Fatherless and Widows: But <hi>F. B.</hi> will have the <hi>main Business</hi> in these to be the <hi>carrying on of a hellish, damnable Plot against Christ and Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the <hi>Quakers</hi> to be limitted <hi>only</hi> to Preaching, Praying, and Exercising their Talent in their Licens'd Meeting-Houses; at this rate our Poor must starve, and our Christian Profession be scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd by any loose and disorderly Walkers, and false Pretenders to it, without Reprehension: No Care nor Christian Discipline in such Cases to be exercised, if no Meetings may be allow'd for these good and necessary Ends. And I dare say, he wrongs other Dissenters, in saying, <hi>This is all they desire or expect, namely, Liberty in their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed Meeting-Houses, to Preach, Pray, and Exercise their Talent;</hi> for I am perswaded, many of them are so Consciencious, as to allow the Extent of Religious Exercises to Practice Acts of Charity, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Order among them, as well as in Preaching and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again, in his Pretence to let us have Liberty equal with others, he appears very Insincere and Contradictory to himself: For p. 171. he dictates this Restriction for a <hi>firm and lasting Cure, To admit each Congregation of Quakers to have their Teacher, or Two, if One will not do;</hi> and likewise, <hi>that those Teachers may attend only their own Flock, and not to range all the World over; at most, not above Five or Ten Miles, to hold forth,</hi> &amp;c. Thus he dictates to <hi>Authority</hi> for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions</hi> to be put upon our Ministers, not only to confine them to several Congregations, but also from Travelling in the Work of the Ministry above Five or Ten Mines (somewhat like the <hi>Oxford-Act,</hi> upon which many suffered <hi>Imprisonment</hi> for six Months, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> So that this presumptuous Dictator's Work still tends to renew Persecution, and to confront the Liberty of Conscience already Graciously Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King and Government. And I don't believe, that other Dissenters from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are contented with such
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58909:24"/>
Restrictions as <hi>F. Bugg</hi> has dictated in this Case, viz. <hi>That their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters should at most not Travel above Five or Ten Miles to Preach,</hi> as he would insinuate, (p. <hi>Ibid.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His dictating to <hi>Authority</hi> against us, to <hi>stop the Growth of Quaker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism,</hi> (p. 169, 170, 171.) appears empty, silly and boasting, as well as envious and interfering with the Liberty granted. For as one swelling in his Pride and empty Boasting, <hi>First,</hi> (he saith) <hi>Let</hi> G. Whitehead, <hi>and some other of the Quakers chief Leaders, and</hi> Fr. Bugg, <hi>be summon'd by Authority to Appear;</hi> as if he were such an Eminent <hi>Champion,</hi> that none were fit to appear to meet him, but some <hi>Chief Leaders</hi> (as he calls them.) One would think the Man should be asham'd of such Dictating and Boasting; as also of his Challenging of <hi>G. W.</hi> and others, when he knows in his own Conscience he has been so often detected of horrid <hi>Falshoods</hi> and <hi>Forgeries,</hi> particularly in that part of my Charge against him, (which he leaves out in his Challenge) <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>That in his late Book, <hi>New Rome Arraigned,</hi> he has forged notorious Lyes in other Men's Names, to ridicule, defame and scandalize divers Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> and Men of good Repute; condemning them also to the <hi>Pillory,</hi> as <hi>Perjur'd Persons,</hi> in his pretended <hi>Trial,</hi> in a way of Judicature, unwarrantably acted by himself, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as 'tis charg'd in <hi>Quakers Vindication against</hi> F.

                  </q> Which part of the Charge he skips, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to touch with it in his <hi>Challenge:</hi> And the other part of his wronging the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> both in Charge, Citation and Observation, is abundantly prov'd against him, not only in that Sheet, but in other Answers of mine; and therefore his Cracking, Vapouring, Boasting and Challenging, looks most silly and insolent, and deserves to be slighted and contemned by all Peaceable, Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Religious Persons. His <hi>Norfolk-Priests,</hi> who abetted him, have greatly labour'd to acquit themselves from being the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengers of our Friends, and labour'd to cast the blame of <hi>first Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging</hi> upon the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> as if it were a Crime to <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge;</hi> but let them read what an insulting, vapouring, daring <hi>Challenge</hi> their Tool and Agent <hi>F. Bugg</hi> makes in his <hi>Appendix,</hi> (p. 171, 172. Taunting against the <hi>Quaker Teachers</hi> (as he calls them) viz. <hi>You may Challenge them long enough, but cannot get them out of their holes; they see and know they are discovered, this makes them timorous; Fearfulness surprizes the Hypocrite,</hi> &amp;c. p. 171.

               <p>Now <hi>F. B.</hi> may'st thou not be ashamed, thus to brag and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, and thus basely to fling <hi>Fearfulness</hi> and <hi>Cowardise</hi> upon us?

And how thou wast confounded, when Matters were closely urg'd and argu'd upon thee, both about the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and thy charging the <hi>Quakers Prophets with giving Witness to</hi> G.

Which notorious Falshood often charg'd upon thee, thou could'st never produce Proof for, though thou hast often repeated it against us after an insolent manner; as in p. 121. and as thou hast partly done, by way of Question, in this thy <hi>Pilgrim's Progress,</hi> p. 135. viz. <hi>Do they not all agree in the main, That</hi> G.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> We deny any such <hi>Agreement;</hi> and thou couldst never yet prove it; nor hast thou shewn us any Book of ours, wherein <hi>G.

then to Boast of our being Timerous to meet thee? Or to Accuse us with Cowardise?

Bugg.</hi> And the 8th, i. e. <hi>Innocency Triumphant,</hi> is so plain a Discovery and Confutation of his Forgeries, Perversions, Falshoods, and notorious Self-Contradictions, that the same is made obvious to every Impartial Reader. So that our <hi>Innocency</hi> stands still <hi>Triumphant</hi> (in Christ Jesus) over our Adversaries Outrage, Boasting, Scorn and Contempt.

               <hi>A Brief Answer to</hi> Francis Bugg<hi>'s late Book, falsly stiled</hi> A Modest Defence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HAving trac'd and observ'd the numerous, bitter and accumulated <hi>Calumnies,</hi> in the said pretended <hi>Modest Defence,</hi> and in many more of the same <hi>Author's Books, Scurrilous Pamphlets</hi> and <hi>Fictions</hi> against the peaceable People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> to incense the <hi>Civil Government</hi> against them; and he being therein often Refuted, I am concern'd herein to take notice only of a few of his notorious <hi>Abuses, Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representations</hi> and <hi>Perversions,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>1st, In his <hi>Dedication to the High Court of Parliament,</hi> (p. 10.) he tells them; <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>tell you, They own the Scriptures to be given by Divine Inspiration, but mean not a word of it, like other Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2dly, <hi>They tell you, they own a Scripture-Trinity, but mean not a word of it; and that Your Honours will find it as difficult a thing to gain the true Meaning of the Quakers, touching the Divine Authority of the Holy Scriptures, and their Belief of a Scripture-Trinity, as</hi> Constantinus the <hi>Emperor found it in the Examination of</hi> Arius, <hi>the Heretick, to get his true meaning, touching the Faith of one Substance.</hi> And he would have them believe, <hi>The Quakers are such Enemies to the holy Scripture, as that they say, It is a rotten Foundation,</hi> Ibid. p. 11. And <hi>that with them it is Beastly Ware,</hi> &amp;c. part 2. p. 29. And <hi>that they render the holy Scriptures to be of no more Authority than</hi> Aesop<hi>'s Fables,</hi> part 3. p. 40.</p>
            <p>Such abominable <hi>Falshoods</hi> this <hi>Incendiary</hi> presumes to Dedicate and Present to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> expresly contrary to our sincere and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Confession</hi> to the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> as Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently given by <hi>Divine Inspiration;</hi> and our Estimation and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the <hi>Bible</hi> to all other Books extant in the World; though many of them may be given by a <hi>Degree</hi> of the same <hi>Divine Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> yet the holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> contain'd in the <hi>Bible,</hi> have not only the <hi>Priority,</hi> but more Eminently and Signally Confirm'd by <hi>Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> more Comprehensive, and more Generally accepted, than other <hi>Books</hi> or <hi>Commentaries</hi> thereupon; the holy <hi>Pen-Men</hi> of the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> having also a higher <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Illumination</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,</hi> in many things, than other <hi>Writers</hi> in after-Ages: And <hi>Christ</hi> himself, whose blessed <hi>Testimonies</hi> are from him Recorded, received the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> not by Measure, but in Fulness; and to be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58909:28"/>
sure, we are bound in Conscience highly to prefer the <hi>Authors</hi> of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> i. e. <hi>Christ,</hi> his <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> above our selves, or any other <hi>Writers</hi> whatsoever; therefore we have cause to allow the <hi>Bible</hi> the <hi>Preference</hi> (as well as <hi>Priority)</hi> before other <hi>Books.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our embittered <hi>Adversary,</hi> to render us the said <hi>People</hi> Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, or not to be Believ'd, and such a difficult thing to gain the <hi>true Meaning</hi> of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> he thus treats us with his wonted Course of <hi>Defamation</hi> and <hi>Calumny,</hi> giving this pretended <hi>Relation,</hi> viz. <hi>That the honest Quakers (for some such there are amongst them) have suspected</hi> G. Whitehead <hi>to be a Jesuite, at least like them: This Witness is true,</hi> (quoth <hi>F. B.) Pref.</hi> p. 18. And farther, he proceeds with this Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry, <hi>viz. By which Evidence we may know, that the</hi> Quakers, <hi>like the</hi> Cretians, <hi>were always Lyars, evil Beasts, slow Bellies; but not only so, but Lyars, Forgers; and, to speak comparatively, Knights of the Post, Jesuits, and dangerous to the Government,</hi> &amp;c. Pref. p. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>Thus furiously he runs on, and clamours, like one without <hi>Eear</hi> or <hi>Wit;</hi> he is Accountable for such odious <hi>Defamation;</hi> and the Righteous Judge of all (I doubt not) will rebuke him for such his <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Outrage.</hi> He strives, in his <hi>Persecution</hi> against us, as if it were for <hi>Life,</hi> even for <hi>our Lives,</hi> in not only defaming <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> for a <hi>Jesuit,</hi> but the <hi>Quakers</hi> in General; and yet <hi>some of them Honest Quakers</hi> too: Such <hi>Confusion</hi> Envy produces. But who these <hi>Honest Quakers</hi> are, that <hi>suspect</hi> G. W. <hi>to be a Jesuit, at least like them,</hi> we are to seek; he tells us not who is his <hi>true Witness</hi> in this Case. G. <hi>W.</hi> utterly denies the <hi>Defamation</hi> against himself, and the rest of his <hi>Friends,</hi> called <hi>Quakers;</hi> being known to be as wholly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely <hi>Averse</hi> to <hi>Popery</hi> as any People in <hi>Christendom,</hi> and more than all <hi>Persecutors</hi> whatsoever; <hi>Persecution</hi> being a principal <hi>Prop</hi> and <hi>Pillar</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> commonly raised by such Clamour and Outrage, as, <hi>Away with them, Hereticks and Schismaticks, they are Seditions, and Dangerous to the Government;</hi> and then <hi>Imprisonment, Havock, Exile</hi> or <hi>Death,</hi> must follow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To his other odious Calumny, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Quakers Church agrees with the Papists, That our Bible is a Brazen-fac'd Book, an unjust, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and perverse Bible,</hi> part 1. p. 4.</p>
            <p>Oh Horrible! The righteous Lord rebuke this <hi>Lying Spirit,</hi> which possesses this <hi>Poor Creature!</hi> How like a furious <hi>Incendiary,</hi> in his boundless Outrage, does he Defame, and most unjustly Asperse the Innocent! Are not the <hi>Bibles</hi> we frequently use in our Houses and Families, the same used by other <hi>Protestants,</hi> and allow'd by <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:58909:28"/>
Pray let this be observ'd, and further inquired into, that the notorious <hi>Lyes</hi> of this <hi>Adversary</hi> may more manifestly appear to the World, to his own and his Abettors <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>disgrace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as I have often urg'd <hi>plain Proof</hi> from him, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> call the Scriptures <hi>Beastly Ware,</hi> but never yet could obtain it: So I now demand <hi>Proof,</hi> that they say, <hi>The Scripture is a rotten Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as before <hi>(Ded.</hi> p. 11.) For <hi>Proof</hi> of this <hi>Lye,</hi> he has quoted a little <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> or <hi>Book,</hi> which he has rak'd up and Reprinted, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <hi>Ishmael and his Mother cast out,</hi> (first printed in 1655.) Upon the Margent, on the 14th page, he repeats the same gross <hi>Lye</hi> again thus, viz. <hi>The Holy Scriptures, they say, are a rotten Foundation: This is their ancient Testimony, from which they have not varied.</hi> This is <hi>F. B</hi>'s <hi>Annotation</hi> against the People called <hi>Quakers;</hi> but where is his <hi>Proof</hi> still? 'Tis upon these words, viz. <hi>With the Light thou art seen to be a Wrester of the Scriptures;</hi> and <hi>thy rotten Foundation being ready to fall thee,</hi> &amp;c. Here is no such word, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> saying, <hi>The Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are a rotten Foundation;</hi> but the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Against that Adversary for <hi>Wresting</hi> the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and that he was judged thereby. And that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> proceeded from the Life and Power of God, were spoken by <hi>holy Men,</hi> as mov'd thereby; as also, a true Declaration of God, the Words of God, who with his dear Son Christ Jesus, and Holy Spirit, and the Baptism thereof, are also confess'd in the said Book quoted;</q> but falsly noted on the <hi>Margent,</hi> as before, quite contrary to these <hi>Confessions</hi> unto the Truth, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of the Holy Scriptures. They that writ the said Book, <hi>Ishmael,</hi> &amp;c. did judge that pretended Pastor, <hi>S. Townsend</hi> (their then <hi>Adversary)</hi> neither to be built upon <hi>Christ,</hi> nor upon the holy <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and that therefore neither of them was his <hi>Foundation,</hi> but a <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Enmity,</hi> when he enviously writ and aspers'd those of us, that were then <hi>Prisoners</hi> for <hi>Conscience sake</hi> in <hi>Norwich Goal,</hi> which was in the year 1654. being 45 Years ago: He then, more like a busie <hi>Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary.</hi> than a <hi>Minister</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> with his envious, defaming <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> did Persecute us by <hi>Reproaches,</hi> to add <hi>Affliction</hi> to our <hi>Bonds,</hi> which then were severe, and we under Hardship in the depth of Winter, wherein my self (with the rest) had my share: Though I then was but weak and young, being but about 18 Years of Age, yet was in my Heart truly tender and sincere to God, and his Presence I often felt to strengthen me in that and divers other hard <hi>Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> (in <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s time) and by his Special, Divine Providence, I was supported in his Work and Service, blessed be his Name for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58909:29"/>
ever! Who also hath made me to Triumph in Christ, over <hi>Reproaches</hi> and <hi>Aspersions</hi> of <hi>This,</hi> and all other my most Implacable <hi>Adversaries. F. B.</hi> may think, he has found out a deadly <hi>Weapon</hi> against me, by his raking up, and reprinting the said <hi>Ishmael,</hi> &amp;c. (printed in 1655.) But he does very ill, and very dis-ingenuously, in upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me and my <hi>Friends,</hi> with some unwarrantable <hi>Expressions,</hi> which I have positively disown'd and disclaim'd in <hi>Two Books,</hi> as he knows. And yet from thence he unjustly asperseth the <hi>Quakers,</hi> That <hi>they dissemble the Doctrine of the Trinity, when they pretend to own it; whilst in their Books, they damn it to the Pit and Lake,</hi> Ded. p. 11. And part 2. p. 22. (Margent) <hi>This is their ancient Testimony, to damn the blessed Trinity to the Pit of Hell,</hi> (the like in Part 3. p. 35.)</p>
            <p>I say, This is not true, 'tis neither the <hi>Quakers</hi> Ancient nor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Testimony; and the passage, upon which he makes this <hi>Note</hi> in the <hi>Margent,</hi> though never intended against either <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Son,</hi> or <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> or this <hi>Scripture-Trinity</hi> (as I may say) Yet I say, as to the said <hi>Passage,</hi> noted upon on the <hi>Margent,</hi> I have positively disown'd, those <hi>offensive Expressions,</hi> publickly in Print, in <hi>Two Books:</hi> The 1st Entitled, <hi>The Christianity of the People called Quakers, Vindicated,</hi> 1690. p. 28. The 2d, <hi>Truth and Innocency Vindicated,</hi> 1699. p. 51. Besides many Years since I corrected them, where I met with that <hi>Answer.</hi> And though I writ some <hi>Passages</hi> therein, yet I still affirm, I was not the <hi>Author</hi> of the said <hi>Unwarrantable Expressions,</hi> nor of divers other sharp ones; but <hi>C. Atkinson,</hi> who miserably fell into <hi>Pollution</hi> and <hi>Condemnation,</hi> after my self and my other Fellow-Prisoners had left him in <hi>Prison,</hi> being discharg'd before him. I was sorry my <hi>Name</hi> was to that <hi>Answer,</hi> without distinction between my own <hi>Words</hi> and his. For though I was then but <hi>Young, Weak</hi> and <hi>Low,</hi> yet I still believe, and am satisfied, I had a Measure of <hi>Understanding</hi> given me of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and a <hi>Sense</hi> of his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Presence.</hi> And I do not deny but I writ some <hi>Part,</hi> or <hi>Paragraphs,</hi> in that Book afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, by reason whereof (I suppose) my <hi>Name</hi> was to it; and the Substance of what I writ, I cannot disown to this day, namely, <q>1. Asserting the <hi>Word,</hi> which was in the beginning, to be <hi>God, Christ,</hi> the <hi>Light,</hi> and the <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi> 2. And that the <hi>Word</hi> was before the <hi>Scripture,</hi> or <hi>Writing,</hi> or <hi>Letter</hi> thereof was. 3. That <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> was the true and only <hi>Foundation,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. This was in Opposition to our then <hi>Adversary</hi>'s Asserting the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be the <hi>only Foundation of Faith,</hi> &amp;c.</q> And I cannot in the least believe, that there ever could be any Intention of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:58909:29"/>
or <hi>Contemptible Expressions,</hi> design'd against <hi>God,</hi> or his Dear <hi>Son,</hi> or <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> among us, or that we could be so grosly dark and ignorant, as to think to confine him in <hi>Darkness,</hi> who is an <hi>Omnipresent God,</hi> and he being <hi>Light,</hi> in whom is no <hi>Darkness</hi> at all; this hath been our Principle from the beginning.</p>
            <p>But to fasten the whole Book, <hi>Ishmael,</hi> on <hi>G. W. F. B.</hi> saith, <hi>he owns the Book,</hi> viz. in <hi>Truth Defending,</hi> 1659. 1. From <hi>Tho. Smith</hi>'s calling it <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s <hi>Book.</hi> 2. From the words, <hi>Our Book.</hi> Part 1. p. 31, 32.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> How far I then own'd it, I have signified: 1. As having writ some part of it. 2. But not then espousing the very words chiefly objected by <hi>F. B.</hi> and disown'd by me, as before; but my own Construction then given, partly in these words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>And he that Dreams, and tells Lyes, contrary to the Scriptures of Truth, which we own, he with his Imaginations and Dreams is for the Lake, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 8. Yet what the Scripture saith of the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which are one, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. we own; <hi>Truth Defend.</hi> p. 1, 2.</q> Tho' I confess, I there questioned the Notion of <hi>Three Distinct or Divided Persons,</hi> as not <hi>Scripture,</hi> but an <hi>Imagination.</hi> And in our <hi>Disputes</hi> at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in the same Year, 1659. My Opponents then Arguing, <hi>They</hi> (i. e. the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost) are Three Hees, therefore Three Persons;</hi> and that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ was under the Water</hi> (when baptised) <hi>and the Holy Ghost then descended upon him like a Dove, therefore Three Distinct or Separate Persons;</hi> I then thought such Arguing as much beside true <hi>Scripture-Divinity,</hi> as good <hi>Logick.</hi> However I cannot call to Mind, That (at those <hi>Disputes</hi> I had with <hi>Tho. Smith,</hi> the Library-keeper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> 1659.) I either did own or defend that very Passage, now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected against us out of <hi>Ishmael,</hi> which I have disown'd and disclaim'd, as before: If I were now Conscious thereof, I should be sorry for it.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Point about the <hi>Trinity,</hi> I refer the <hi>Reader,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To a <hi>Catechism,</hi> in the <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Phrases</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> with this <hi>Imprimatur; Guil. Sill. R. P. D. Henr. Episc. Lond. â Sacris Domesticis,</hi> printed 1693. wherein are these <hi>Questions</hi> and <hi>Answers,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>Q Is there any more than One God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There is none other God, but one, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 4.</p>
            <p>Q. What is said of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is said, That these <hi>Three</hi> are <hi>One,</hi> 1 John 5. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> Here they confine themselves to <hi>Scripture-Language.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis worthy of Observation, what Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> now Bishop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> in the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>John, Earl</hi> of <hi>Rochester,</hi> p. 104. speaking of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58909:30"/>
               <hi>Trinity;</hi> saith, <hi>Which for want of Terms fit to express them by, we call</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; <hi>and are called in Scripture the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides the false Printing, and bad English in the said <hi>Ishmael,</hi> (as <hi>F. B.</hi> has expos'd it) there's another Defect; after the words <hi>[The Lake is thy Portion, which is the Portion of Lyars]</hi> the words <hi>[except thou speedily Repent]</hi> are omitted there, and in some other places.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Old Impression</hi> I have not seen for many Years, nor do I know where to find it, tho' it seems <hi>F. B.</hi> hath industriously sought it out, and reprinted it (after a fashion) with his perverse <hi>Annotations</hi> in the Margent, to reproach <hi>Quakers</hi> withal.</p>
            <p>And now, let's a little observe <hi>F. B.</hi>'s <hi>Definition</hi> of <hi>Person,</hi> part 1. p. 18, 19. <hi>viz.</hi> From the words <q>[<hi>God, Christ,</hi> the <hi>Light,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God within me, and these are one</hi>]</q> 
               <hi>F. B.</hi> infers; viz. <hi>Reader, here is in the Quakers Essence</hi> Septem Personas.—Also from the words <q>[Stumble not at the <hi>Light,</hi> for if thou dost, thou stumblest at <hi>God,</hi> at <hi>Christ,</hi> at the <hi>Door,</hi> the <hi>Way,</hi> the <hi>Truth, Life,</hi> the <hi>Rock,</hi> the <hi>Elect Stone;</hi> and all these are but One]</q> 
               <hi>Here again</hi> (quoth he) <hi>is One added; here is</hi> Octo Personas <hi>in the unity of their Essence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence observe (by the way) what rare <hi>Syntax</hi> he makes, <hi>viz. Here is Octo Personas,</hi> instead of, <hi>Here are Octo Personae;</hi> but chiefly, how he has defined <hi>Person,</hi> which is not our <hi>Term</hi> for those <hi>Names</hi> given to <hi>Christ,</hi> for to make so many <hi>Persons</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as <hi>Names</hi> are given to him, as those in <hi>Metaphors, Parables</hi> and <hi>Similitudes,</hi> which are numerous in <hi>Sacred Scriptures;</hi> may he not then, by such <hi>Logick</hi> or <hi>Dofinition,</hi> render <hi>Christ</hi> to be an <hi>Hundred Persons</hi> in One Essence? What silly Conceits float in this Man's giddy Head! What think his <hi>Friends</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> of him? Is he a fit <hi>Champion</hi> to undertake to defend both <hi>Theml,</hi> their <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Protestant Religion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, I do confess, That altho' I have often seen it my Duty, to explain some of our Christian <hi>Friends Meanings,</hi> when mistaken or perverted by our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> I really believe, I have truly Construed their <hi>Intentions,</hi> and that I have cause to understand the same better than our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> or <hi>Enemies.</hi> And as for my own part, I have learn'd that <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Self denial,</hi> that I am not Conscious of being <hi>Pertinacious</hi> against <hi>Light,</hi> true <hi>Conviction,</hi> or holy <hi>Scripture Testimony.</hi> And I hope also this <hi>Advertisement</hi> may satisfie every Charitable and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous <hi>Reader,</hi> having been Sincere and Consciencious towards God from my Youth upward to this day, according to the Measure of <hi>Light</hi> and Understanding he hath bestowed upon me; humbly hoping, and verily believing, he will so preserve me in <hi>Christ</hi> unto the End.</p>

'Tis observable how insulting and boasting this <hi>F. Bugg</hi> is in his <hi>Dedication</hi> to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> comparing himself, in his <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> against the <hi>Light,</hi> with <hi>Daniel</hi> his <hi>bursting in sunder the</hi> Baby lonish <hi>Dragon: Even so</hi> (quoth <hi>Bugg) have I been instrumental, and burst in sunder the Quakers great Idol, their Darkness within, which they call the Light within.</hi> Thus presumptuously he Boasts and Blasphemes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his former <hi>Confession</hi> to the <hi>Light,</hi> which we (called <hi>Quakers)</hi> profess, according to <hi>John</hi> 1. 4, 9. There is a <hi>Wo</hi> to such as put <hi>Light</hi> for <hi>Darkness,</hi> and <hi>Darkness</hi> for <hi>Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He proceeds in his empty <hi>Boasting</hi> and <hi>Insulting</hi> thus, viz. <hi>I have cut down the lofty Weeds and tall Cedars,</hi> Pref. p. 27. <hi>The Sting of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerism being taken out, and the Bowels thereof ript up, and their Inside turn'd outward,</hi> Part 2. p. 31. <hi>And having taken this Snake, Quakerism, out of the Grass, and laid her on the Table, and taken out her Sting,</hi> Ibid. p. 27. <hi>But Reader, I have not done with this Snake, but must have the other blow at her, and smite off her Head, lest she get into the King's High Court of Parliament to do mischief; for she is a mischievous Beast, and full of deadly Poison, and begins to stink all the Nation over,</hi> Ibid. p. 30. Thus far <hi>F. B.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let the serious <hi>Reader</hi> judge, what a presumptuous, reviling <hi>Boaster</hi> this is, as if the <hi>High Court</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> were much beholden to him, for his <hi>Defence</hi> of them, by thus shamefully Reviling the <hi>Quakers.</hi> But how helpless, mean and indigent, does he Imply the <hi>Parliament</hi> to be, to have need of such a <hi>Physitian</hi> to prepare them <hi>Antidotes!</hi> And then, what <hi>lofty Weeds</hi> and <hi>tall Cedars</hi> has he cut down among the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers?</hi> What great Execution has he done, by his bitter <hi>Invectives, Scorn, Railery,</hi> and <hi>Profanation</hi> of the <hi>Sacred Name</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> as before is manifest? Have not his mischievous Attempts (tending to a <hi>New Persecution)</hi> made him <hi>stink</hi> in the Nostrils of all Moderate, Serious and Unprejudiced <hi>Readers,</hi> and Observers of his Works of <hi>Revenge</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> thereby making himself (and <hi>Abettors) Infamous,</hi> while he seeks to make himself <hi>Famous?</hi> But God will debase his <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Presumption!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Altho' he would render himself an <hi>Eminent Champion,</hi> as having <hi>Cut down</hi> and <hi>slain Quakerism,</hi> yet eagerly endeavours to Influence both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> against us; he presumes to <hi>Dedicate</hi> his bitter and scurrilous <hi>Invectives</hi> against us to the <hi>King's High Court of Parliament,</hi> superlatively stiling himself, <hi>Your Honours most Humble and most Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Servant;</hi> and arrogantly presumes to write an <hi>Address to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty King</hi> William <hi>the Third,</hi> therein also stiling himself, <hi>One of the Meanest, yet most Dutiful Subject,</hi> Francis Bugg; therein notifying <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> in particular; and in pretence, <hi>Most humbly Praying in the</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:58909:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Name of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and other his Dissenting Protestants, that Care may be taken to suppress the same;</hi> i. e. <hi>the Quakers Doctrine and Books, (viz.</hi> such as he writes against.) In which he would also encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the <hi>King to Judge, who is in the Wrong, and to punish accordingly. And in this Case</hi> (saith he) <hi>let not the King respect Persons in Judgment,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Hence observe the <hi>Presumption</hi> of this <hi>silly Creature,</hi> thus to presume to be the <hi>King's Dictator,</hi> and that in the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and other <hi>Protestant Dissenters</hi> too, to Influence and Incense him against his <hi>Peaceable Subjects,</hi> called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as if nothing short of <hi>Punishment, Persecution</hi> and <hi>Suppressing,</hi> would pacify his <hi>Revenge</hi> against us!</p>
            <p>But how comes <hi>F. Bugg</hi> thus confidently to <hi>Address</hi> King <hi>William</hi> in the <hi>Name</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and other his <hi>Majesty's Dissenting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi> as if they had set him on Work, so bitterly to Inveigh against the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as he hath done? Seeing in his <hi>Dedication</hi> to the <hi>Parliament</hi> he tells them, He <hi>can with good Conscience say, That from first to last, no Clergy-Man in the Kingdom ever asked or desired him to write one Book, Page or Line, against the Quakers; nor have any one Man, Clergy or Laity, seen this Book, till printed.</hi> If this be true, then both the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, Laity,</hi> and all others, are so far Excusable, as to this Book of his, unjustly stiled, <hi>A Modest Defence:</hi> But then, hath he not wronged the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Dissenting Protestants</hi> too, by his <hi>Addressing</hi> the <hi>King</hi> in their <hi>Names</hi> against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> seeing <hi>they neither asked nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired him to write one Book, Page or Line, against the Quakers; no, not one Clergy-Man in the Kingdom?</hi> &amp;c. If <hi>none</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> nor <hi>any other,</hi> set him at work, how durst he <hi>Address</hi> the <hi>King</hi> expresly in their <hi>Names?</hi> If he writ <hi>Truly</hi> to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> how could he so write <hi>Truly</hi> or <hi>Honestly</hi> to the <hi>King?</hi> What an officious <hi>Agent</hi> was he then, so peremptorily to <hi>Address</hi> the <hi>King</hi> against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Books, in the Name of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and other Dissenting Protestants,</hi> and that for <hi>Punishment</hi> too? He seeks to Incense both <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and other <hi>Dissenting Protestants,</hi> against the peaceable People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as if he aim'd at their sole <hi>Ruin</hi> and <hi>Destruction.</hi> For which End they shall not want his Exclamations of <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Blasphemy, Cheats, Impostors, Jesuits,</hi> &amp;c. ay, to Incense the World against them, if he could. But <hi>God's Power</hi> is above the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils!</hi> Glory to our <hi>God,</hi> and to the <hi>Lamb,</hi> that sits upon the Throne for Ever and Ever!</p>
            <p>I conclude with this Scripture, as applicable to our <hi>Persecuting Adversary.</hi> Psalm 36. 1. <hi>There is no Fear of God before his Eyes.</hi> (v. 2.) <hi>He flattereth himself in his own Eyes, until his Iniquity be found to be hateful.</hi> (v 3.) <hi>The words of his mouth are Iniquity and Deceit.</hi> (v. 4.) <hi>He deviseth Mischief upon his Bed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
