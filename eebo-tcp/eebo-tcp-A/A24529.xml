            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>ROyal Prerogative</hi> is a ſubject of that nice and tender Quality, that 'tis undoubtedly an unpardonable Preſumption for any common unhallow'd Pen to touch. 'Tis not the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of Zeal and Loyalty that takes up the Pen, that can apologize for the Bold Hand that guides it, any more than <hi>Zimri</hi> that held up the <hi>Ark.</hi> If an Examination of the Fountain and Boundaries of <hi>Supreme Power</hi> fall under any Cognizance, 'tis unqueſtionably in the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Body.</hi> The opening the Cabinet of ſuch Records belongs to their Hands that keep the Key. If therefore the forementioned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, even ſimply conſidered, is an Offence of that high Nature, certainly the Tranſports of that mad Scribble that outruns all the Bounds of Truth and Reaſon; and Launches into thoſe unaccountable Miſtakes and Fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies, as utterly to deſtroy the very Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of the Conſtitution, muſt deſerve a double Laſh. A more notorious Inſtance whereof has not been matcht in the late Licentious Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64250:3"/>
that has made ſuch a Noiſe in the Town, of which not only the Author but Licenſer have fallen under the juſt Diſpleaſure of our worthy Patriots in Parliament aſſembled; a Rebuke ſo proper from 'em, in a Cauſe where Their own and the Nations Honour is ſo highly concerned, and which deſerved a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premand from no Leſs a Hand than Theirs.</p>
            <p>'Tis the Boldneſs of that hardened Piece that we preſume in ſome few Remarks to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine; a Piece which certainly nothing but Infatuation (Infatuation the Pen-man's beſt Excuſe) could dictate. For beſides the egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Unreaſonableneſs of the whole Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that Diſcourſe, 'tis abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible the Author in his Right Wits ſhould ever hope that ſuch a ſubject on ſuch a Baſis ſhould pleaſe any thing Living, himſelf only excepted.</p>
            <p>For inſtance; Suppoſe it in the favourableſt Senſe, a well-meaning Loyal Harangue, with both theſe fair Aſpects, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, as intended a Court-ſervice to Their Majeſties, by fixing the Crown upon their Heads by ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable a Right and Tenure as That of <hi>Conqueſt.</hi> And Secondly, Settling the Peoples Obedience
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64250:3"/>
in a firm and duteous Reſignation to the Sovereign Authority; founded on that Claim and Poſſeſſion: Yet both ways has the Author inſtead of the leaſt gaining his Point, utterly loſt his Aim.</p>
            <p>For Example, He is ſo far from careſſing Their Majeſties in it, that 'tis poſſibly the courſeſt and moſt diſreliſhing Compliment (to give it no worſe Name) he could have pickt them out, in writing them <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</hi> That way of Acquiring a Crown being the remoteſt from their Thoughts from the firſt Step towards the Revolution, and through the whole Courſe of their Acceſſes and Advances to the Throne. The Prince's Declarations all utterly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured any ſuch Pretenſion; nor indeed were the Forces he brought over a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Strength for the leaſt Shadow of ſuch an Attempt. And though 'tis true, ſeveral contributing Providences, to our never to be forgotten Happineſs, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to enable the Gratitude of <hi>England</hi> to reward their Champion and Deliverer with the Preſentation of a Diadem; yet I am certain in his proudeſt Tryumph (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64250:4"/>
the Barbarity of that Epithet) he would have taken it very diſdainfully to have been ſaluted with the Addreſs of the Thief to <hi>Alexander, viz.</hi> to be Entituled that <hi>Greateſt of Robbers,</hi> however otherwiſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Name, a <hi>Conqueror.</hi> No; thanks to Heaven, a ſofter and gentler Coronation Glory, <hi>Oblation</hi> and <hi>Gift,</hi> not <hi>Rapine</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> incircled that Brow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Non Rapit Imperium Vis tua, ſed Recipit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if after all this, thls doughty Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has endeavoured to lay ſo ungrateful a Load upon the Royal Shoulders, he has made the moſt miſtaken Piece of Work on't that Folly and Ignorance could ever be guilty of; at leaſt if intended as a Favour.</p>
            <p>Nor indeed is his intended popular Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice herein a much more welcome Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, For</p>
            <p>Firſt, Here's the whole Glory of <hi>England</hi> totally eclips'd for ever, when a poor hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of 14000 Men, ſuch wonderful Victors, could make ſo intire a Subjection of the little-hearted <hi>Great Britain</hi> with ſo much Eaſe, and ſo ſmall Trouble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64250:4"/>
Tis poſſible if ſuch a Feather wou'd ſtick in the <hi>Hoilanders</hi> Caps, there wou'd not want that Vanity in ſome of our <hi>Hogan Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> that partly in Reſpect and Favour to their Royal <hi>State-Holder,</hi> and a little in pride to themſelves, would perk up and plume with ſuch a Title, As <hi>Third William,</hi> the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Conqueror.</hi> And yet as matters ſtand, ſo much to the contrary, and ſo far from ſuch a Thought, I fancy, there's not the pooreſt <hi>Dutchman,</hi> even in his very Ale, but has long ſince learnt better <hi>Engliſh;</hi> though our Enthuſiaſtick <hi>Engliſhman</hi> this ſober Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, has pleaſed ſo wilfully and ſo ſtrangely to forget himſelf, and his Mother Tongue.</p>
            <p>This <hi>State-Caſuiſt</hi> little conſiders what a Blow he has given to the whole <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, provided they are of that opinion as to joyn with him in Glorifying their Majeſties with his Attribute of Conquerors. For their Martial Memorials will furniſh but a poor homely Record, <hi>viz.</hi> That 25000 not one of them durſt ſtrick a ſtroke, nay, ſo many of them run off to the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> for all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64250:5"/>
this Submiſſion and Deſertion, to a Conquer or, is down-right Dread and Terror, no Kindneſs and Inclination, which are only due to Gueſts and Friends. 'Tis well for him, that the Parliament by way of Civill Magiſtracy have taken him into Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for were he under Martial Judgment, I would not run his Gantlet, for twice the honor of being Author of his Pamphlet.</p>
            <p>Nay the Parliament themſelves are not much in his Debt, I mean as to any over great kindneſs owing for Civilities received from him; for he has made bold to put a damnable Slurre upon the whole <hi>Convention of England:</hi> For at his rate of Faith, or Front rather; (for we hope he believes better things) they were all very impertinently buſy, in beſtowing of Imperial Crowns upon the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> when God knows they were his own before. For if he claimed by <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> having before that time the whole Power, every Fort, Town, Stengh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thro all <hi>England</hi> in his hands; and conſequently the Univerſal ſubmiſſion of the Nation in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64250:5"/>
yeilding all to this to him, the whole Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Regalia</hi> of Conqueſt being then already his own, the Conventionary Donation was but Triffle and Mimickry: Nay, Their Majeſties themſelves are a little overſeen (if like our Author I may make ſo bold with them) in Commencing their Anniverſary of their Reign from the 13th of <hi>February.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, the Confuſions ariſing from his Hypotheſis are too numerous to recite: All that we can think worth Commendation in it is that he has made His Majeſty doubly a Conqueror. For Firſt belike he Conquered King <hi>James,</hi> and then himſelf: For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the peculiar claims and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Conqueſt, he has intirely waved them all, and has ſat down contented with a plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> limited Monarchy, without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the leaſt Jewel of Conqueſt for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning his Diadem.</p>
            <p>'Tis true our Author bound himſelf to a more modeſt Circle in the notion of Conqueſt, his poſition being confined to this narrow Compaſs. <hi>viz. That King</hi> William <hi>Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64250:6"/>
King</hi> James, <hi>but not the Nation; and that therefore he acquired a Title to all the Rights of King</hi> James, <hi>but not to any Rights of the Nation. That King</hi> James <hi>had a Right to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern this Natton, but by being Conquered he loſt that Right,</hi> and in ſhort, King <hi>William won it.</hi> The buſineſs therfore of this ſhort Paper is to fadom and examine the depth of this Poſition, being indeed the Grand Theſis of the whole Book.</p>
            <p>Now to begin with the Incongruities in the very Foundation of his Diſcourſe: For <hi>to Conquer a King and all his Rights,</hi> and thoſe Rights being granted <hi>to entend to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Kingdom,</hi> and yet to make that diſtinct and wholly ſeparate from the Rights of the Nation, is ſo near to a contradiction that nothing poſſibly can be nearer, the Right of Governing over a People being at leaſt their higheſt and deareſt Concern, and the Conqueſt of that Right, and the Latitudes of Power annext to ſuch a Conqueſt, being undoubtedly their tendereſt and neareſt Conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:64250:6"/>
Well, as great as it was, King <hi>William</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd all this, which in every vulgar Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, was conquering as much as King <hi>James</hi> had to loſe; a very fair Prize, let me tell ye, for by Birth-right, and all the ties of Succeſſion, his Right extended to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Adminiſtration of three Realms, as far as the Land-Marks of Law reach'd in the Rule and Sway of a limited Monarchy: A goodly Conqueſt, the Peoples unconquer'd Rights remaining, being only Duty and Obedience to their Soveraign Conqueror accordingly, which how far agreeing with the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Their Majeſties Acceſſion to the Crown will ſoon be examined.</p>
            <p>If King <hi>James</hi> his Deſertion upon all the Premiſes ſuggeſted by this Author, <hi>viz.</hi> That, <hi>ſeeing the Peoples Univerſal Inclination for, an Adherence to the Prince of</hi> Orange, <hi>Theirs and his Armies total Defection and Revolt, the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Strengths, Gariſons, all things committed and yielded up to the Prince, and conſequently, all the Regalia of Conqueſt inveſted in him; and that thereupon, looking upon himſelf as a van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſht
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64250:7"/>
Prince, he fled before the Conqueror, left</hi> London, <hi>&amp; retired to</hi> Feverſham <hi>in order to make his eſcape from Subjection, and being there taken Priſoner, attempted, and ſucceeded in his ſecond eſcape at</hi> Rocheſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If all theſe Premiſes, I ſay, Intitule our preſent Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign to the Stile of <hi>Couquerour;</hi> by the ſame parallel Reaſons urged by this Author, I will as ſtrongly prove, that there never was a Change from the <hi>Lancaſtrian</hi> to the <hi>York,</hi> or from the <hi>York</hi> to the <hi>Lancaſtrian</hi> Line, in all the Succeſſions from the Conqueſt, but every ſuch Change equally might challenge the claim of Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>For firſt, we muſt take it for granted, (and therein our Author agrees with us) that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very poſſeſſing <hi>Yorkiſt,</hi> or <hi>Lancaſtrian</hi> Prince was lawfully King, more eſpecially if his Right was confirm'd by ſeveral unbroken Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the ſame Deſcent and Family. And if ſo, undoubtedly, whatever conteſting Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute lay between the red and white Roſe, the Non-poſſeſſing Family had all their Pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſwallow'd, and ſilenced in the Poſſeſſors prevaling Intereſt and Title.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:64250:7"/>
Hereupon, ſuppoſing the poſſeſſing <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrian-</hi>Prince dies, as ſoon as the Breath is out of his Body, the whole Regalia, the Imperial Claims are all, <hi>ipſo momento,</hi> in the nex <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtrian</hi> Heir: (for in that Senſe the King ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dies) and therefore, ſuch Heir as right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully King, upon the ſtarting up of a <hi>York</hi> Branch into the Throne, which cannot be done, but as the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Caſe, with the total Bent and <hi>Byaſs</hi> of the Peoples Inclination or Conceſſion at leaſt. (for what Motives or Reaſons perſwaded, it matters not) Here's the <hi>Lancaſtrian</hi> Right Heir, and as Heir, now rightful King of <hi>England</hi> diſpoſſeſt: And whether the Caſe exactly quadrate in all particulars with that of King <hi>James,</hi> viz. That the thus Diſpoſſeſt Abdicates, flies the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or abſconds in it, at leaſt, he utterly runs before the prevaling Prince, and <hi>Volens Nolens,</hi> quits all Claim, to the poſſeſſing Arm of Power, perhaps more intirely in that point than King <hi>James</hi> has done. Nay, all this too (to parallel Circumſtances yet a little nearer) poſſibly after tougher &amp; longer Diſputes then
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64250:8"/>
the <hi>Two Battles</hi> urged by the Author for <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminaries</hi> to the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Victory, <hi>viz. The Skirmiſh at</hi> Wincanton, <hi>where Thirty of the Prince of</hi> Orange's <hi>Men defeated Seventy Horſe, and Fifty Dragoons under</hi> Sarsfield; <hi>and the other at</hi> Reading, <hi>where another Party of the Prince's kill'd Fifty of King</hi> James'<hi>s Dragoons.</hi> Now, I ſay, if ſuch Circumſtances as theſe are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make the Alienation of the Crown a Conqueſt, how many Crown'd Heads ſince Firſt <hi>William</hi> muſt write Conquerours! Nay, not in <hi>England</hi> only; for the whole <hi>Chronicles</hi> of all Nations would be ſwell'd with Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions that with full as much Reaſon would fall under that Denomination. For inſtence, The preſent King of <hi>Portugal</hi> may with full as much Right juſtifie the Title of Conqerour, his elder Brother his Predeceſſor, being unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately Delirious, and thereby guilty of Miſ-government, was by the People and the States of the Kingdom, removed, and expell'd from the Throne, and the younger Brother planted in his Seat, and not only made Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſour of his Brother's Kingdom, but of his Brother's Wife the Queen too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:64250:8"/>
And what matters the diſtinction between King <hi>James</hi> and the <hi>Portugal</hi> King's Miſgovernment,, one through a crazed, and the other a Religious Frenzy, let it ſuffice both of them were laid aſide, both their Subjects aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and deſerted them, both were equally forced to Abdicate, and conſequently both their Succeſſors might claim an equal Title of <hi>Conquerours,</hi> only with a little Advantage on the <hi>Portugal</hi>'s ſide: For had our Author been his Hiſtorian, he muſt have added one little Jem more to his Diadem, then he has done to King <hi>William</hi>'s, for as belike <hi>King</hi> William <hi>only conquered King</hi> James, <hi>the King of</hi> England, <hi>but not the People of</hi> England, the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> Conquerour, in the like Conqueſt, out-ſhot him a whole Bows length, for he conquered both King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> and Queen too.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the extravagant Follies, and ridiculous Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities from ſuch an Hypotheſis would be endleſs, for granting King <hi>William</hi> was juſtly entituled Conquerour from that Hour he had King <hi>James</hi> in his Power, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Reſtraint and Subjection, as our Author terms it; by the ſame parity of Power and Subjection, there's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a civil Broyl or moſt unnatural Rebellion, to inſtance too many, where Kings have been often in the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subjects Power, but during that Maſtery the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by his way of Reaſoning, might ſtile themſelves <hi>Royal Conquerours:</hi> For though as our Author diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes in our preſent Soveraign's Caſe, by the long recited Plea of Juſtice in his entring the Kingdom with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Power; yet, in the forementioned Rebellious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urrections, the Prevalence oſ the Sword, whether in a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64250:9"/>
right or wrong Cauſe, may equally pretend to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt:</hi> This I am certain the <hi>French</hi> King makes no ſuch Diſtinction, and his very Enemies are pleaſed to write him Conquerour even in the vileſt of his Triumphs, the very Towns and Acquiſitions he has bought with his Levidores, and Conqueſt at beſt, how ſtrong ſoever a Title, is not the moſt ſparkling Crown Jewel.</p>
            <p>But to leave this remoter Diſcourſe, I ſhall come to one intire and utter Confutation of our Author's whole Chain of Argument. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was not properly the <hi>Conquerour of King James</hi> even in his own Reſtriction and Limitation of Conqueſt, <hi>viz. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour of King James, but not of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Example, after King <hi>James</hi> had look't upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a vanquiſht and an abandoned Prince, as he terms it; and therefore, whither out of ſhame of ſtanding a too critical Enquiry into his Male Adminiſtration, or detected Intreagues, refus'd the proffer'd Retreat of <hi>Ham</hi> Houſe; or out of any other Fear or Motive, deſerted his Kingdom, and fled, and eſcaped into <hi>France;</hi> yet even then was not the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in his higheſt Power, any way King <hi>James</hi>'s Conquerour; for inſtead of his being Conquer'd, it then lay in the Breaſt of the whole People and Community of <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Convention</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, to have recall'd him back again, (that is, if ſo minded) to have treated him ſtill, as King of <hi>England,</hi> to have received and refixt him again on his Throne on ſuch and ſuch Terms and Articles of Security, for better Adminiſtration, and future Amendment, if any ſuch could have been hoped or expected, and the Prince all
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64250:9"/>
the while (though invited over by them, as their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer) ſo far from claiming <hi>Conquest,</hi> or being his own Chooſer, by Vertue of any ſuch Pretenſion; that on the contrary, it lay wholely in the Peoples Breaſt, how far their Gratitude would reward their Protector of their Religion and Liberties.</p>
            <p>So that upon the up-ſhot, If King <hi>James</hi> was <hi>Conquer'd,</hi> 'twas by his own fearful or wilful running away from his Kingdom, whereby the People Seizing his quitted, abandon'd, and relinquiſht Crown into their own then Rightfull Poſſeſſion, by ſuch Diſertion and Relinquiſhment, made a generous and grateful Preſent of it to their moſt Honour'd Champion, then fully and lawfully empour'd to accept ſo Glorious a Gift; inſomuch, that if, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Author's Notion, there be any thing of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querſhip</hi> in the Caſe, to Humour our Author's Fancy, it lies between King <hi>James,</hi> and the Victorious Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> have the leaſt, or rather no part at all of any ſuch Claim or Challenge. And if there were any ſuch thing as <hi>Conquest</hi> in the Caſe, alas, the <hi>Conquering</hi> blow was not given till the <hi>Convention</hi> was pleas'd to declare, the Imperial Crown of <hi>England</hi> was for ſuch &amp; ſuch Cauſes devolved into theirs and their only Hands, and as ſuch they were pleas'd to diſpoſe it, where and to whom, as their indiſputable Will and Pleaſure ſeem'd Meet and Reaſonable.</p>
            <p>So that, to draw Matters towards a Concluſion, our Author has involved himſelf in the moſt unaccountable Labyrinth and Confuſion, from his Chimerical diſtinction of Conquering King <hi>James,</hi> but not the Kingdom of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64250:10"/>
               <hi>England,</hi> which ſtrictly examin'd, is little more than juſt nothing. For, How did he Conquer King <hi>James?</hi> Yes, he frighted his Perſon out of his Kingdom; (that is, if his own conſcious terrifying Faults did not do it for him) but as to his Crown, Title, Kingſhip, Royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thoſe he conquer'd not; all thoſe were purely and wholly the Conceſſion and Grant of the People, and no ways his own Atchivement or Acquiſition. So that, to ſum up the whole, in ſtiling our Gracious Sovereigns, King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> Conquerours in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Circumſtances, he has given them a Title of neither Honour nor Service, for they hold both by a ſtronger and fairer Claim, derived from the Original Fountain of Power, the univerſal Donation of the People under the Poſſeſſion and Devolution aforeſaid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus this unhappily ſtarted Notion of Conqueſt-Tenure muſt not only be an ungrateful Theme to the Nation, as ſo notoriouſly derogating from the Glory of their own Act and Deed, the aforeſaid Donation of the Crown; but likewiſe, be a nauſeous and irkſome Apprehenſion to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Peoples Conſtitution and Kidney, who are not poſſibly overfond of ſuch a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of Imperial Majeſty reigning over them; and therefore, our Author has very unfortunately managed ſo untowardly an Argument, intended for the indearing and inducing a more Zealous Devotion and Obedience to their Majeſties, from ſo weak and ſo unattractive an Invitation, as the Title of Conquerours.</p>
            <p>This Gentleman, take the whole Maſs of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe together, I muſt do him that right, has a very
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64250:10"/>
honeſt Meaning. He has made it his Buſineſs to aſſert the Right of their preſent Majeſties in as vigorous a Manner as the warmeſt Zeal and Affection could In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire, has throughly evinced from his Poſitions laid down.</p>
            <p>That King <hi>James</hi> hath totally loſt his Right to theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; and therfore, if he comes again with an Army, he is to be looked upon by the Subjects with no other Eyes than any other Invader, but is to be reſiſted by them. Our Fleets and Armies, without any ſcruple of Conſcience to weaken their Hands, may and ought to fight as becomes Valiant Men, in the defence of their preſent Soveraigns, and their Countrey; and that not only againſt the <hi>French</hi> King, but likewiſe againſt the late King <hi>James,</hi> if he ſhould come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with a Fleet, or head an Army againſt us.</p>
            <p>But after all, as there is no occaſion or want of the Claim of <hi>Conquest,</hi> either to ſtrengthen their Majeſties Intereſt, or weaken the Pretence of his Enemies, under what Name or Claſs whatever. All this Duty to the one, and Reſiſtance againſt the other, are equally, if not more ſtrongly enforced from that ſofter and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Royal Right, inveſted and lodged in Their preſent Majeſties, from the fore-mention'd clearer Fountain of Power.</p>
