            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>MODUS LITIGANDI OR FORM OF PROCESS Before the LORDS of COVNCIL and SESSION.</head>
            <p>A PROCESS comprehends the Instruments and order of Procedour in the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Justice.</p>
            <p>By Instruments are meant Writs and Testimonies, as Oaths of Parties, Witnesses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Processes are brought in before the Lords divers wayes: some in the <hi>first Instance,</hi> some in the <hi>second.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the first Instance, the most ordinary way was, of old, by ordinary Summons, which were drawn up by the Writers to the Signet, without any Bill or Warrant from the Lords, because the Stile and nature of them was current and known, in the same manner as the Brieves of the Chancery. But where there was any thing singular or extraordinary, it behoved to proceed by special Warrant of the Lords: whether it were different from the common Stile, in relation to the Diets or endurance of the Citation, or in relation to the Table and Roll by which Summons were to be called, or in relation to the mater it self. And therefore a Bill was presented to the Lords and pass'd; and the Summons thereupon bears <hi>Ex deliberatione dominorum concilii,</hi> which the ordinary Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons bear not. Now most part of Summons are rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed upon Bills.</p>
            <p>Processes also come in upon naked <hi>Supplication</hi> without a Libel passing the Signet, in some Causes, especially if they concern Advocats, Clerks, Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Agents, and other Attendants of the House; which the Lords call (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Complaint) by the <hi>Macers</hi> summarly, and thereupon grant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100573:3"/>And now since the discussing of Causes by a <hi>Roll</hi> is established by Act of Parliament, the Lords for dispatch of Complaints of smaller moment, upon special consideration represented by Bill, do grant Warrant to <hi>Macers</hi> or <hi>Messengers,</hi> to cite Persons in <hi>

                  </gap>rgh</hi> or the <hi>Suburbs</hi> upon 24. Houres, to answer before the Ordinary upon the Bills, who discusseth the same summar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without any signetted Libel, and so without abiding the course of the Roll. They do also upon complaint of any Contempt, as if Parties proceed to Execution where Stops of Execution are granted, summarly give Warrant by a Deliverance on the Bill of Complaint, to cite the Persons complained upou wheresoever they dwell: which is summarly discuss'd by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary upon the Bills.</p>
            <p>Processes do likewise come in by Letters of <hi>Horning</hi> without an antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>earing of Parties: especially where Horning is ordained to proceed summarly by Act of Parliament, or ancient Custom. So Letters are granted for the King`s Revenues, and likewise for the Charges of Commissioners of Parliament, for Reparation of Kirks and Kirk-yards, and for Removing from Gleebes designed for Ministers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These are called <hi>GENERAL LETTERS,</hi> because they bear not warrant to charge any particular Person, but general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all and sundry concern`d, as Heretors, Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etters, Tenents, and Possessors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore such Charges differ litle from other Summons, and are easely suspended: because the Party or Messenger has power to make the Application. But they require no <hi>Diet</hi> or <hi>Continuatìon</hi>: and yet the Party charged (or Defender) ere he can be heard, must <hi>suspend</hi> and sind <hi>Caution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All other general Letters of Horning are prohibited, where either the thing charged for, is not specially express'd, or the Names of the Persons charg'd: except as to benefic'd Persons, to serve for an Intimation of their Provisions, but not to denounce any Party. <hi>Par.</hi> 1592. <hi>cap.</hi> 240.

               </gap>se: but thereupon Escheats fall not, though Caption doth follow. For preventing whereof the Lords by Act of <hi>Sederunt.

               </gap>iles and Tenors of ordinary Summons, and of most part of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged Summons passing by Bill, as now become fix'd and ordinary, are commonly known and observ'd by the Writers to the Signet, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in their Stile-Books, which they are obliged, and every Session en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn`d punctually to observe. And they will be censured by the Lords if they transgress, not only in the Stile of Summons without Bill, but also in presenting common Bills of course (without special notice of the Lords) upon trust of the Writers, and Servants in the Bill-Chamber who write the Deliverance upon the back of the Bills. The like, if the Stile be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in general Letters or other Letters, of Horning, Diligence, and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torials.</p>
            <p>All these Warrants of the Lords contain a Command to <hi>Messengers,</hi> or <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risjs in that part,</hi> to cite and charge the Parties. And in ordinary Summons
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100573:3"/>
the Citation is to a Day, which is left blank that the Obtainer thereof may make use of any Day he pleases, within a year after the Summons are rais`d.</p>
            <p>Most part of Summons formerly, did abide <hi>Continuation:</hi> that is, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender being cited and the Day of compearance past, the Clerk marked the Summons as being <hi>called</hi> and <hi>continued</hi> till such a Day: albeit in reality they they were not called, because the Defender was not obliged to answer, till he was cited again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which was by Letters pass`d under the Signet, making mention of the first Summons, of the Citation, and Continuation of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and commanding <hi>Messengers</hi> to cite the Party to the second Diet, which also was left blank that the Obtainer might use it any time within a year after their obtaining thereof. Such Summons were not continued as were instantly verified by Writ, or needed no other Probation than the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons it self, as being <hi>negative</hi> or presumed in Law to be <hi>true.</hi> But if the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons behoved to be proven by the <hi>Oath</hi> of the Defender, or by <hi>Witnesses</hi> the same was then to be continued except in some few priviledged Causes as in Actions of <hi>recent Spulzie, Ejection,</hi> and others. And though Summons up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Bills by the Deliverance of the Lords bare expresly, to proceed without Continuation; yet that passing of course, was but <hi>periculo petentis,</hi> and the Summons behoved to be continued. The Act also of Continuation behov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be extracted before Process could proceed.</p>
            <p>But now by the Act of <hi>Par.</hi> 1672. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. Acts of Continuation and second Summons are discharged. And it is ordained, That in Cases where second Summons were before required there shall now be one Summons with two Diets, in which the Executions to the first Diet may be given by any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as being <hi>Sheriff in that part</hi> constitute by the Letters. But after the Day to which the Party is fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st cited, the second Citation must be given to a new Diet by <hi>Messengers,</hi> when any Point is re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>err'd to the Defender's <hi>Oath,</hi> with Certification if he compear not and depone, he shall be holden as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd.</p>
            <p>After the last day of compearance is past, if the Pursuer insist not; the Defender may compear and produce a short Copy of the Citation given to him, which being delivered to a Sub-Clerk, he will thereupon call the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer, of course, before the Ordinary comes out. And if no Advocat com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for the Pursuer, the Clerk will admit <hi>Protestation:</hi> so called, because the Defender's Advocat doth either really compear or is reputed to do so, and to protest, That his Client being cited to such a Day, and that Day past, (the Pursuer not compearing to insist) He may not be obliged to answer till he be summoned of new again. Which Protestation the Clerk admits, and extracts a Sentence of the Lords, bearing them to have admitted the said Protest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion: which is a kind of Sentence <hi>absolvitor</hi> from that <hi>Instance,</hi> and any thing done thereafter till new Citation will be null. If any Advocat compear for the Pursuer, the Clerk will assign him a Day to produce his Summons: and then will call again upon the Copy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and give him a short Diet more, to produce, with Certification that Protestation will be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And then calling the third time, the Ordinary will admit Protestation unless the Process be produced. Upon which Protestation the Defender may raise a Summons against the Pursuer to insist, with Certification if he insist not, never to be heard again. Wherein if the Pursuer of the principal Cause appear, he will get a Day to produce and insist: at which time Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100573:4"/>
will be admitted. Or if at the first, the Defender compear not, the Day of compearance being past, if the Pursuer of the principal Cause appear, he gives in his Summons to a Sub-clerk who calls the same after the Day of compearance is past, though there be no Judge present. And if none appear for the Defender, the Clerk writes thereupon, and either <hi>decerns</hi> or <hi>assigns a Day to prove</hi> as the Procurator demands, or <hi>grants Certification.</hi> But if the Cause be not ordinary and obvious, the Clerk must advise with the Lords: who will consider the <hi>Relevancy</hi> of the Summons, and the sufficiency of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,</hi> and either give <hi>Act</hi> or <hi>Sentence</hi> as they see just; or otherwise forbear, if the Libel be not relevant and proven.</p>
            <p>In ordinary Cases the Clerk extracts the <hi>Decreet</hi> or <hi>Act,</hi> as if it were done upon special notice of the Lords. If any Compearance be made for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, the Clerk then marks upon the Summons or Act of Continuation the names of the Pursuer's Advocat and Defender's in these terms, <hi>Actor</hi> such a man, <hi>alter</hi> such a man <hi>to see.</hi> After which there can be no further procedure till the Process be seen by the Defender's Advocat. And if there be several Advocats for several Defenders, the Process is marked to be seen in such a mans <hi>House,</hi> where they should either conveen to consult their several Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, or borrow the Process for that effect, and return it. But the Pursuer doth more safely, when he takes back the Process from the first Party, and gives it to be seen severally to the rest. For otherwayes they will delay him when they come to the Dispute, and will at least get liberty to see the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in the Clerks hands till the next Calling, that in the mean time they may borrow the Process from the Clerk (upon their Receipt) and see the same.</p>
            <p>Processes were accustomed not only to be <hi>seen</hi> and <hi>called</hi> once every Session, and if they were not marked by the Clerks so called, there could be no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess till a Summons of <hi>Wakening</hi> was raised: for they were not only said to be <hi>asleep</hi> in the mean time, but also the Defender's Advocats were not obliged to answer, unless they had seen the Process that same Session. But since the Act of <hi>Regulation,</hi> a Process being once seen is not to be seen again, unless there be <hi>Alterations</hi> in the Summons, or new <hi>Productions.</hi> Yea when the Process hath not been called for a whole year, and that thereupon there be a Citation upon a <hi>Wakening,</hi> the Cause goes on as it stood in the Roll before, and is only seen with the <hi>Wakening</hi> in the Clerks hands.</p>
            <p>The Pursuer's Advocat when he gives out the Process to be seen, writes upon the back thereof, <hi>Given out by &amp;c. to &amp;c. to be seen,</hi> and subscribes the same. And after two or three dayes calls for the Process back. He doth also ordinarly write an Inventary of the Process apart, or upon the back of the Summons and the Defender`s Advocat by accepting of the Summons, is presumed to have received the same the day mentioned upon the back of the Summons, and to have received the Peeces of the Process mentioned in the Inventary: because if these be not truely set down, he may refuse to accept of the Process. If then the Defender`s Advocat deliver back the same, he must write upon the back, that they are <hi>seen by him</hi> and subscribe his name. Which if he refuse to do, and to give back the Process, the Pursuer by a Ticket may complain to the President, or Ordinary upon the Bills, who will call the Defender's Advocat and amerciat or fine him, till he produce. Or otherwise the Pursuer upon a Copy of the Summons, may cause the Sub-clerk call the Defender's Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats to reproduce the Process, With <hi>Certification</hi> that if he do not, his Copy
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100573:4"/>
               <hi>will be holden as a principal,</hi> and <hi>holden as proven,</hi> whereupon the Defenders will be <hi>decerned.</hi> Which Certification being admitted, a <hi>Decreet for not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>production</hi> may be extracted, which will have all Execution as any other Decreet in absence: and albeit it be more easily suspended, yet not ordinarly without Caution.</p>
            <p>But for the Security of Parties, that they may not be wronged by the Clerks, all that passes every day, is mentioned in the <hi>Minute Book:</hi> which Book is read in the <hi>Outer-House</hi> every day after twelve a clock, and nothing can be extracted till it be read in the Minute Book and twenty four Hours thereafter; that in the mean time either Party may compear and produce, or take up the Process and get the Decreet delet out of the Minute Book, and oftimes at the very reading of the Book, they compear and get it delet.</p>
            <p>If the Pursuers after the Process is seen, make any alteration therein by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of new Writs, and altering or mending of the Summons; the Defender must see of new again the Peeces of the Process, or the Pursuer's <hi>Title,</hi> where there is any required to be produced, (which is in most Causes) and which instructs the Pursuer's Right, as the <hi>Summons,</hi> or <hi>Charge,</hi> with the <hi>Executions Acts</hi> of Process, and Writs produced for <hi>Probation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Processes allowed to be seen in the <hi>Clerks hands</hi> being kept up beyond the time appointed, upon Complaint from the Clerk, they are ordained to be delivered the next day under a certain Penalty, as ten or twenty Dallers. And upon the second Complaint, Warrant is given to debar Advocats from coming within the Barrs, and to incarcerat Agents and Servants, till the Process be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>produced and the Fine payed.</p>
            <p>Processes being thus seen and ready for Dispute, the same are <hi>inrolled</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Dates of the <hi>Return</hi> marked upon the backs thereof; he who is first ready being first to be discuss'd, without preference of the Parties: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Kings Causes, which after fight may be called without inrolling, at any time upon 14. dayes Intimation to the Defender's Advocats, wherein <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natars</hi> Processes are not comprehended.</p>
            <p>Which Rolls being affixed on the Walls of the <hi>Outer House</hi> Parties and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocats may inform themselves, to be in readiness to dispute without surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, or tergiversation.</p>
            <p>Ordinary Actions after they are <hi>seen, returned</hi> and <hi>inrolled</hi> are called by the <hi>Roll.</hi> If the Pursuer compear not to insist, the Defender may crave <hi>Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon his <hi>Copy.</hi> But ordinarly the Pursuer compears, and relates the Cause shortly, if it be an ordinary Summons, the tenor and nature whereof is fixed and known; which therefore he needs not relate, but only mention the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and crave Decreet, if there needs no further Probation: and if there do, he then craves a Day <hi>to prove.</hi> But if the Cause be upon a libelled Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, not having a particular known Stile, the Pursuer doth more fully relate, not only the tenor of his Summons, but the merits of his Cause, to inforce the <hi>justness</hi> and <hi>equity</hi> of the Cause in particular: unless the Lords upon hearing the relation of the Summons stop him, till it appear whether the Defender controvert the <hi>Relevancy</hi> thereof, yea or not. For it is an improfitable spending of time, for the Pursuer to inforce the Relevancy of the Summons, if the Defender controvert not the same. In the next place, the Defender if
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100573:5"/>
he resolve to dip upon the merits of the Cause, or to adhere rigorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to exact <hi>form</hi> in the order, then he relates the merits of the Cause, and odiousnesse of the Pursuit, and thereupon proceeds to his Defenses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Defenses</hi> do not only comprehend <hi>Exceptions</hi> properly so called, but all <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections</hi> against the <hi>Relevancy</hi> of the Summons, <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>Interest.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Defender propones his Defenses against the Order of the Process; and first, <hi>That the Day of compearance is not yet past.</hi> And because the Day of compearance in the Summons and Letters by negligence is left blank, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender uses to score the same, or to fill up a wrong Day, and to object there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. But if the Day of compearance be mentioned in the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it will be sufficient, albeit the <hi>Blank</hi> be scored: and if it be wrong fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up, the Ordinary will sometimes cause the Clerk immediatly mend it, and so proceed. And at other times doth as he seeth the Cause favourable, or not.</p>
            <p>The <hi>second Defense</hi> is upon the Dayes of Citation: wherein the common Rule is, that against Persons without the Kingdom, Citation should proceed at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iercat Cross of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and Peer and Shoar of <hi>Leith,</hi> upon <hi>threescore</hi> Daye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for the first Summons, and <hi>fifteen</hi> Dayes for the second; and for Persons within the Kingdom upon <hi>twenty one</hi> Dayes for the first and <hi>six</hi> for the second.</p>
            <p>From this Rule are excepted Summons upon <hi>recent Spuilzie, Ejection, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusion,</hi> or <hi>Succeeding in the Vice</hi> of Persons against whom Decreet of <hi>Remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is pronounced, which are priviledged by Statute to proceed upon a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>fifteen</hi> dayes. And by Custom <hi>Removings,</hi> Causes <hi>alimentary, Exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions</hi> Summons for making arrested Goods or Sums <hi>furthcoming, Transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, Wakenings, Poindings of the Ground, special Declarators, Suspensions, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vento`s,</hi> and <hi>Transumpts</hi> are commonly priviledged by the Lords Deliverance upon <hi>six</hi> Dayes. And the second Citation when it is needful is always upon <hi>six</hi> dayes except against the Inhabitants of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and the <hi>contiguous</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs thereof, where the second Citation may be upon <hi>twenty four Hours</hi> which is declared by Act of <hi>Sederunt. Iune</hi> 21. 1672. concerning <hi>priviledged Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi> And the Writers to the Signet are prohibited to insert any other Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third Defense</hi> is, That the Summons hath not two Citations conform to the Act of Parliament 1672. For clearing whereof it is to be considered, that the reason of double citation is, that the Defender may have more Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before any Process be sustained against him, not only to give him competent time to propone his Defenses, but to ascertain him of the Citation, which is some times clandestinely done, but not so easily when there are reiterat Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>Some times Causes are priviledged to proceed upon one Citation by <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Custom,</hi> and sometimes by the Lords <hi>Deliverance.</hi> The Law allows no Continua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this yeelds no Defense for principal Debitors, or for Cautioners bound <hi>conjunctly and severally</hi> as Principals: for one of them may be called withoue the rest.</p>
            <p>The <hi>seventh Defense</hi> is, the order of <hi>discussing:</hi> whereby the Defender al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, No Process against him till such other Parties be <hi>discussed.</hi> As Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners not being bound <hi>conjunctly and severally as full Debtors,</hi> are not liable till the Principals be discuss'd.

            <p>The <hi>eighth Defense</hi> is, That the Libel, or some member thereof, is not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levant:</hi> For clearing whereof it is necessary distinctly to understand what the <hi>Relevancy</hi> is, which is so frequent and important a Term in our Law. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levancy is a <hi>relevando,</hi> to relieve or help: and therefore a thing is said to be relevant, when, if it be <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proven,</hi> it would relieve the Pursuer or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainer, and give him the Remedy which he infers and concludes in his Libel, and craves to be done as due by <hi>Justice.</hi> For every sufficient Libel contains an argument or ratiocination, sometimes in form of a <hi>Syllogisme,</hi> when the point of Law is fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st deduced, as the <hi>major</hi> Proposition; and then the matter of Fact is related, as the <hi>minor</hi> or <hi>Subsumption:</hi> and thence the <hi>Conclusion</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred as consequent in Justice, applying the Law to the Fact subsumed, and craving the Remedies of that Law to be applyed to this Fact, for the help or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100573:6"/>
remedy of the Pursuer in his Complaint. And therefore in the Libel he is called <hi>Complai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er.</hi> But more frequently Libels are framed as an <hi>Enthimeme</hi> wherein the matter of fact is deduced as the <hi>Antecedent:</hi> and it is thence infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that in Justice such remedy should be adhibited. Where sometimes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the matter of fact is deduced, and before the <hi>Conclusion</hi> or Remedy craved, the Law is mentioned: either <hi>generally,</hi> That the Fact related as done or omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Defender, is contrary to Law, Equity, Reason, or Justice; or <hi>specially,</hi> contrary to such Points of Law. Or otherwise it is subjoyned to the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> That upon the matter of Fact libelled, it ought to be declared or decerned as is libelled, according to Law, Equity, or Justice: or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly according to such Points of Law.

So that the Remedies of Law proceed upon Justice and Truth.</p>
            <p>The effect is the same<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore the Defense, That the Libel or such a Member of it <hi>is not relevant,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports this, That the Conclusion craved is not <hi>just,</hi> or that there is no sufficient ground for it in <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Equity.</hi> And therefore the Pursuer must condescend upon what ground o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which is ordinarly done in <hi>favourable</hi> Cases: nor will the Decreet be quarrellable as <hi>ultra petita,</hi> or disconform to the Libel. But if the Case be <hi>unfavourable,</hi> he may forbear to qualifie the Conclusions, and assolzie <hi>a libello ut libellatur</hi>: which will not exclude new Summons, where the Conclusion is rightly qualified: as neither will an <hi>Absolvitor</hi> in a Reduction, exclude a <hi>Reduction</hi> in the same Cause, upon <hi>new Reasons</hi> upon <hi>different</hi> points of <hi>Fact,</hi> or <hi>differently</hi> qualified. But it is not so in <hi>Suspensions:</hi> where the Decreet suspended not having taken effect by Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, the Suspender remains in effect <hi>Defender,</hi> and the Charger who obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Decreet, is still <hi>Pursuer</hi> to get his Decreet put to execution.

But the Term <hi>Relevan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> is most formal and frequent with us, and more than with any other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Roman</hi> Law, and the Nations that follow that Law, do but seldom men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it: and the <hi>English</hi> know it not. But their Dispute to the same purpose, is of the <hi>sufficiency</hi> or <hi>goodness</hi> of the Plea, or Defense, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet we do never adhibite the term <hi>Relevancy,</hi> but to a matter of Fact <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> or <hi>to be proven,</hi> whether in the Libel, Exception, Reply, or Duply, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when the Alledgence is only an <hi>Objection,</hi> we do not debate whether the Objection be relevant. As when Writs are adhibited to instruct a Libel <hi>ab initio,</hi> the Ordinary will hear the Dispute upon the Writs produced, and the Objections made against the same. Wherein the terms are not, That the Writs are not relevant, but that they <hi>instruct</hi> not, or that they are not to be <hi>respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> for such reasons: and the Pursuer endeavours to inforce the same, and answer the Objections. In all which it is improper to mention <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>ninth Defense</hi> is upon the <hi>Competency,</hi> Whether the Suit be compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>hoc ordine.</hi> For albeit the Libel be <hi>relevant,</hi> yet it may not be <hi>compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exceptions,</hi> so properly called, are not founded upon the <hi>Defects</hi> of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit, but are founded upon some positive <hi>Right</hi> or Fact, distinct therefrom, <hi>exclusive</hi> thereof: and that either for a <hi>time,</hi> or for <hi>ever.</hi> Those Exceptions which exclude the Defense but for a time, are therefore called <hi>Dilators:</hi> those which elide the Cause for ever, are therefore called <hi>Peremptors, quia perimunt seu destruunt causam.</hi> And albeit Dilators may assolzie the Defender <hi>ab in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia aut lite,</hi> yet never <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> causa.</hi> And therefore some Dilators are more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly termed <hi>peremptoriae instantiae.</hi> To make both clear by example; in the most frequent Pursuits, as in Actions for Debts, if the Defender alledgeth that the Pursuer cannot insist for <hi>payment</hi> of the Debt, because the Debitor by his Promise or Writ is engaged not to seek the Sum for a time, or hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced or discharged Action or Sentence; if the time be not very long to come, Sentence will be pronounced, suspending execution till that time: which <hi>qualifies</hi> the Sentence, and is <hi>dilatory</hi> as to the <hi>execution.</hi> But if there be an absolute Paction upon the Debitor's part <hi>de non petendo,</hi> or that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender hath his Discharge or Renounciation of the Debt, or if the Defender alledge <hi>Payment</hi> or <hi>Compensation</hi>; these Excep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ions are <hi>peremptory,</hi> which if proven willassolzie the Defender for ever. And though commonly all Defenses, whether they be <hi>Exceptions</hi> or <hi>Objections,</hi> are called <hi>dilatory,</hi> if they do not absolutely determine the Cause: yet it is clear what difference is betwixt an Exception and Objection: the Objection being only the alledging of a <hi>Defect</hi> and <hi>Nullity</hi> in the Pursuit, and therefore are <hi>partes judicis,</hi> which if he do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100573:7"/>
notice, although there were no Defender, he would not decern. As if there were an Act or Sentence craved before the Day of compearance were come, or if the Summons were not upon the Dayes requisit by the Law, or if the Executions were defective in the Requisits ordained by Law, or if the Libel were not <hi>relevant,</hi> or any member thereof, or were not <hi>competent</hi> in such a Process: all which reasons are <hi>negative,</hi> and require no further Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But proper Defenses are <hi>positive</hi> and are not proper to the Judge to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: and are not founded upon <hi>deficiency</hi> of the Process, but upon some posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Fact</hi> competent to the Defender.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dilators</hi> must be instantly ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As to the first, that Dilators must be <hi>instantly verified,</hi> the reason is because they do not determine the Cause, and to run a course of Probation for instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting a Dilator, were tedious and expensive, and not worthy of the work. Therefore Defenders are to prepare themselves, and have in readiness the Writ or Witnesses to inctruct the Dilator, which will be received without any Citation or Diligence, but being instan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly called by a Macer will be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For instance, if a Tenent be pursued to remove, and alledge, all Parties interessed are not cited, <hi>viz.</hi> his Master, to whom he is Tenent by payment of Maill and Duty before warning: this is a Dilator, and it must be verified <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanter,</hi> that the Person he condescends upon was his Master before the warning: which may be done either by production of his Master`s Discharges, or by Witnesses, if they be in readiness. Yet in some Cases a Term may be granted to instruct a Dilator, as if the Defender have a Supersedere of the Pursuer for a considerable time, or a probable cause for which he hath not the Writ in his own hand: if he make faith <hi>de calumnia,</hi> he may get a short time <hi>cum one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re expensarum.</hi> Which is most fully performed without assigning a Term or Diet to instruct the Dilator, but repelling it as not instructed, yet super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:100573:7"/>
As to the <hi>Competency</hi> of Defenses, the chief Objection is, That such an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgence is not receivable by way of <hi>Exception</hi> without <hi>Reduction.</hi> As if any person be pursued upon a Bond, and alledge <hi>Minority</hi> and <hi>Laesion,</hi> or alledge <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdiction,</hi> or that the Bond was granted by his Predecessors <hi>in lecto aegritudinis</hi>; these will be repelled as incompetent. Much more, if in any Pursuit upon a real Right, it should be alledged to be <hi>a non habente potestatem.</hi> So also <hi>nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates facti</hi> upon Clauses of Failzie, bearing that in such and such Cases such Rights should be null, are incompetent by way of Exception, even albeit the Clause bear that the same shall be null <hi>without Declarator:</hi> for the Lords not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, will not sustain the same without a preceeding Declarator. If these Provisions be <hi>penal,</hi> the Lords will also allow the Parties to purge the Failzie, by performance at the Bar, in the Declarator: and therefore not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain such Alledgences by <hi>Exception,</hi> or by <hi>Suspension</hi>; but by Reduction, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarator: especially in heritable Rights, and matters of great moment. Though in matters of small moment, when the Parties are poor, they will indulge that favour, which is competent to them by the eminency of their Office, whereby they are not altogether straitned by the limits of ordinary Form. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Act of Parliament 1621. against <hi>fraudulent Alienations</hi> make them null by Exception, or Reply; yet the Lords do not sustain it, in regard that no Infeftment can be taken away, without the Superiors and Authors be called.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Nullities in Law,</hi> whereby there is a visible defect in the Solemnities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit to a Writ or Right, which requires not the calling of a third Party; are competent by way of Exception, or Suspension: and in effect are rather Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, than Exceptions. As, That a Writ is null by the Act of Parliament 1540. because it wants Witnesses: or because, the Witnesses, or Writer, or both are not designed: or because, being a Writ of importance, it is subscribed by one Notary, and not by <hi>two</hi> Notaries and <hi>four</hi> Witnesses.</p>
            <p>Against the Defense of Nullity upon the want of Witnesses, this Reply is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levant, That the Writ is <hi>holograph,</hi> all written and subscribed with the Granter`s own hand; which is probable by Witnesses: not only if they prove, That they saw the Writ subscribed; but if they positively affirm, and clearly cognosce, That it is the ordinary Hand-writ of the Party, both as to the Body and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription. Against which Reply, this Objection is competent; That the point to be proven, is concerning the <hi>Date,</hi> or time of the Subscription: which the Writ cannot instruct, albeit it be proven <hi>holograph.</hi> Yet the Lords will sustain the same, if it be proven by other Adminicles, and Witnesses who saw the Writ subscribed of the Date it bears; or who saw the Writ before the time in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: but such Witnesses must be <hi>above all exception.</hi> As when a Discharge grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Cedent, is excepted on, against an Assigny; who if he alledge, That it is null, as wanting Witnesses, and the Defender in fortification of his Defense offer to prove, That it is <hi>holograph</hi>: and the Pursuer yet objects, That it cannot prove the Date; the Defender in fortification of his Defense offering to prove by Writs relating to the Discharge, or Witnesses above exception, That they saw the Discharge as it now stands, before the Intimation of the Assignation; the Lords will sustain the Defense, if so fortified. Which albeit it appear to include a Duply, and Quadruply; yet it is but a complex Defense: seing as to the members thereof, there interveens no Reply, nor Triply, but only two Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: which the Lords upon advising, might supply, albeit not objected by the Party. As if in a Reduction of a Bond against an Assigny, as being payed before the Intimation, or Assignation; if the Defender be absent, and a <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lograph</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100573:8"/>
Discharge be produced, the Lords, if they advert to it, will not find the Reasons proven; unless the Pursuer prove it <hi>holograph,</hi> and instruct the Date thereof to be true, or at least anterior to the Intimation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nullity</hi> of the want of the Writer`s name insert, or the Witnesses, is elided by condescending upon the Writer, and his designation, and upon the Witnesses: seing thereby the intent tf the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> is fulfilled, which is that there may be means to improve such Writs if questioned.</p>
            <p>All these hold not in Writs that are regulat by the Law of Nations, and not by the proper Law of our Country, in which the Consuetude of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is sufficient to astruct the Writ: as <hi>Bills of Exchange, Orders, Letters of Advice, Accompts,</hi> and <hi>Receipts</hi> amongst Merchants, which do require no such Solemnities.</p>
            <p>And in like manner Writs not made in <hi>Scotland</hi> but abroad. <hi>secundum consuetudinem loci,</hi> are valid without these Solemnities, and take effect in <hi>Scotland.</hi> But the Custom of that Place's observing, or not observing such So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, must be instructed. As Writs subscribed by one <hi>Tabellion,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi>; and Writs <hi>sealed and delivered,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi>; prove, though the Writer be not mentioned, nor the Witnesses designed. But in these two Kingdoms, if the Writ bear only to be <hi>signed,</hi> but not to be <hi>sealed and delivered</hi>; it doth not yet prove, till it be approven by the Oaths and Testimonies of the Witnesses.</p>
            <p>In proponing of Exceptions, the Defender ought not to give Reasons for the Competencie, or Relevancy thereof, unless the Judge call for them: as when they are not ordinary, and appear not to him relevant and competent, though there were no answer made. Otherwise, having repeted his Defense, he should be silent, untill he see if the Pursuer object against the Competency or Relevancy thereof; or whether he propone a proper Reply, to elide the Exception, without further Debate. In which the Dispute goes over to the Reply, and so unto the Duply, untill the Point be discuss'd. The Defender may also propone several Defenses, which, if found relevant and competent, he will be heard upon all. And what he omits, that was then competent, will not be receivable in the <hi>second Instance,</hi> by Suspension, or Reduction: nor will be admitted after <hi>Litis contestation,</hi> unless it be then <hi>instantly verified,</hi> or be <hi>emergent,</hi> and new come to Knowledge. The reason is, that Process be not drawn in length, to the vexation of the People in their Rights, by perpetuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of uncertainty of Plea. Which was alwayes used as necessary in <hi>ordinary Actions</hi>; and now of a great while, also in <hi>Suspensions</hi>: the reason being alike in both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exceptions</hi> are so various and many, that it is not proper here to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, much less to explain them: what we intend by this, being but to give a short view of the <hi>forme</hi> and not of the <hi>matter</hi> of Process. It shall suffice to name some few most common and most ordinary.</p>
            <p>Besides what hath been said of Defenses before, and besides the obvious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of <hi>Satisfaction, Payment,</hi> or <hi>Discharge,</hi> and the <hi>Personall</hi> Exception against persons being <hi>Rebells,</hi> and so not having <hi>personam standi in judicio</hi>; which will exclude the Pursuer, till it be elided by <hi>Relaxation,</hi> or till the Rights and Process be assigned, for then (it being personal) it will not follow the Assigny: which is also competent against the Defender, whom though the Pursuer hath called to appear, yet he may hinder him by Horning, but cannot hold him as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100573:8"/>
               <hi>confest,</hi> if he will not suffer him to depone: for albeit the King`s Officers might exclude him, yet Horning being but a <hi>civil Rebellion</hi>; it is against rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that he that provokes him to Judgment, should exclude him from it. Wherein neverthelesse, Pursuers will sometimes be so cruel as to crave the Defender to be holden as confest; albeit they wil not suffer him to compear, and depone, which the Lords do not admit. <hi>I</hi> say, besides these, there are further the common Exceptions of <hi>Praescription, Renounciation, Innovation, Transaction,</hi> and the Exception <hi>rei judicatae,</hi> and <hi>litis contestatae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Praescription</hi> was once as large as <hi>Exception,</hi> till it was appropriat to this chief kinde of Exception. We have many Praescriptions in <hi>Scotland.</hi> As 1. of a <hi>Year:</hi> and so <hi>Tutors of Law</hi> not serving themselves within a Year, their Interest prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes, and there is place for a <hi>Dative.</hi> 2. Of <hi>three Years</hi>: so <hi>Inquests</hi> can not be called in question by <hi>Summons of Error,</hi> so as to inferr any prejudice against the Persons of <hi>Inquest</hi> after three Years. <hi>Recent Spulzies,</hi> as to their speciall Priviledge of <hi>summar Process, Oath</hi> in litem, and <hi>violent Profits,</hi> praescribe, not being intented within three Years after the Warning. So also Actions for House-maills, Servants-Fees, and Merchants Compts, praescribe, as to the manner of Probation by Witnesses, if not intented within three years: and are then only probable <hi>scripto, vel juramento.</hi> So the Preference of the Creditors of the Debitor, to the Creditors of the Heir in affecting the Estate of the Defunct, by the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> praescribes in three years. 3. In <hi>four Years,</hi> the Action of Reduction upon <hi>Minority</hi> and <hi>Laesion</hi> prescribes, after the Partie's Majority. 4. In <hi>fiue Years,</hi> the Right of any holden and repute <hi>Heritable Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors,</hi> (&amp; so possessing for five years,) praescribes so in the case of Forfaulture, that if the Possesor be <hi>forfaulted,</hi> &amp; the KING succeed; all other Parties Rights are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, unless they have interrupted the Possession, and raised Process with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in five years before the <hi>Forefaulture.</hi> 5. The effect of <hi>Infeftments of Property,</hi> and <hi>Possessory Judgments</hi> thereupon, praescribe by the Defender`s possessing <hi>seven Years,</hi> by vertue of an Infeftment, or Tack, from a third Party: so that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Actions for <hi>Maills and Duties,</hi> or <hi>Removings,</hi> are excluded, and the Defender`s Right cannot be taken, away but by Reduction, being clad with seven years lawful Possession. 6. The <hi>legal Reversion</hi> of Apprisings which did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire or praescribe, by seven years after the Date of the Apprising doth now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and praescribe by the course of <hi>ten years,</hi> from the deducing thereof. And of Adjudications, the Legal expires in five years, if they be <hi>special</hi>; and if <hi>general,</hi> in ten years. 7. <hi>Summons of Error,</hi> or <hi>Reduction</hi> of <hi>Retours</hi> deduced since 1617. do praescribe, if the Summons be not intented within <hi>twenty years</hi> after the Service. 8. And <hi>lastly,</hi> Heritable Rights<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and all other Rights praescribe, if not pursued, nor possessed by, during the space of <hi>fourty years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Exception of Praescription of 40. years, is elided first by the Reply of <hi>Minority,</hi> because that Praescription runs not against <hi>Minors</hi>: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there must be 40 years, besides the years of their Minority. 2. All Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription are elided by <hi>Improbation,</hi> because the Case of <hi>Falshood</hi> is excepted. 3. The Praescription of <hi>three years</hi> as to the quarrelling the Persons of <hi>Inquest,</hi> runs not against Minors, or <hi>Absents foorth of the Countrie.</hi> Neither doth the Praescription of the <hi>Legal</hi> of Apprisings, run against Minors. And if a Major succeed to a Minor, he hath a <hi>Year</hi> after his Succession to redeem. 4.</p>
            <p>And <hi>last</hi> of all, Praescriptions are elided by <hi>Interruption,</hi> in the manner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by Law: whether the Interruption be by <hi>natural</hi> Possession, or <hi>civil</hi> by intenting competent Process, or by legal Acts or Instruments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Renounciation</hi> is a common Exception: whereby the Pursuer renouncing the Right or Action, he (or any representing him,) is thereby excluded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100573:9"/>
But in <hi>Real Rights,</hi> singular Successors will not be excluded by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounciation, unless there had been a Process against the Partie Renouncer, whilst he had Right, whereby the matter became <hi>litigious,</hi> which is <hi>vitium inhaerens,</hi> descending to singular Successors. But in all <hi>Personal Rights,</hi> the Renounciation of him who hath Right for the time, is valid, not only against his Heirs, but against singular Successors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Innovation</hi> is also a common Exception: whereby any new Right is given, not in <hi>Security</hi> or <hi>Corroboration,</hi> but in full <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of a former Right; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that former Right is extinct and there can be neither Action nor Defense thereupon.</p>

               <hi>Transaction</hi> is also a common Peremptory Defense: for thereby the former Right is either taken away in <hi>whole,</hi> or in <hi>part,</hi> and in so far only is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense peremptory. For there can be no Transaction, (properly so called,) but where the Right transacted is either innovat, or simply renounced, or quit for a Sum of Mony, or an onerous Cause, or at least abated.</p>

               <hi>Exceptio rei judicatae,</hi> is where the same Cause now pursued, hath been judged before, and decerned. For there is no new Process therea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The Exception of <hi>Litiscontestation</hi> is rather a <hi>dilator,</hi> than a <hi>peremptor</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, because thereupon the Cause is not determined. But the Pursuer may be thereby excluded from any other Process, without prejudice to him to insist in that wherein <hi>lis est contestata:</hi> unless the new Pursuit be different from the former, at least <hi>super diuerso medio.</hi>

            <p>In all Processes whatsoever whether in ordinary Actions, or in <hi>Reductions,</hi> and sometimes in <hi>Suspensions, Litiscontestation</hi> may be made.

Whereupon there is an <hi>Act</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, deducing the Process, and Points sustained and admitted to Probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and likewise those that are repelled: which doth contain the <hi>Libel,</hi> or <hi>Suspension,</hi> the <hi>Compearance</hi> of the Parties, and the <hi>Production,</hi> and the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Otherwise the Lords may stick to give him Sentence: or if by inadvertency they do, the Sentence will be easily suspended, or reduced, unless supplied as aforesaid.

               </gap>tation the Pursuer is ordained to prove his <hi>Libel,</hi> and the Defender his <hi>Exceptions.</hi> For instance, if the Pursuit be for Payment of a Debt, if the Defender propone his Defense upon a <hi>general Discharge,</hi> not relative to any particular Debt, or if he do propone <hi>Compensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; he doth not acknowledge the Truth of the Libel, and so he may deny the same: and if he prove either of his Defenses, or the Pursuer fail in prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Libel, the Defender will be assolzied. But if the Defender propone an Exception of <hi>Payment,</hi> it doth <hi>acknowledge,</hi> that the Debt was <hi>due:</hi> and therefore the Pursuer needs not prove his <hi>Libel,</hi> but the Defender is to prove his Defense; wherein if he succumbe, the Pursuer will prevail, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Probation.</p>
            <p>In like manner, in a Pursuit of <hi>Spuilzie,</hi> if the Defender except upon <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Poynding,</hi> he doth acknowledge the Libel, as to intromission with the particulars in his <hi>Exception</hi>; but he may deny the <hi>rest,</hi> or he may deny the <hi>Prices</hi> libelled, which therefore the Pursuer must prove.

And if the Defender succumbe, he will not be heard to quarrel the Prices or Quantities libelled, for want of Probation thereof.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Exception</hi> doth sometimes acknowledge the Libel, and sometimes not; so doth the <hi>Reply</hi> sometimes acknowledge, or not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Exception, as to the <hi>Quantities</hi> or <hi>Prices</hi>; and the Proponer will yet be put to the proving thereof. And the <hi>Duply</hi> is in the same case, as to the <hi>Reply, &amp;c.</hi> So that sometimes the Pursuer will have to prove his <hi>Libel</hi> and <hi>Reply,</hi> and the Defender his <hi>Defense</hi> and <hi>Duply.</hi> For instance, in a Pursuit for Debt due by Bond, if the Defender except upon <hi>Compensation,</hi> and the Pursuer reply upon a <hi>Discharge</hi> of the Debt compensed on, and the Defender alledge, That he hath right to the Sum (wherewith he would compense,) as <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signy,</hi> and if any such Discharge was, it was posterior to his <hi>Intimation</hi>; there the <hi>Libel, Exception, Reply,</hi> and <hi>Duply,</hi> must all be proven. And if the Pursuer succumbe in proving his Libel, whatsoever be done in the rest, the Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is assolzied. If the Pursuer prove the <hi>Libel,</hi> and the Defender succumbe in proving his <hi>Exception</hi>; albeit the Pursuer faill to prove the <hi>Reply,</hi> he carries the Cause.

And if he resolve to advise with the Lords, his term is, <hi>you shall have the Lords Answer</hi>: which he will seldom refuse, if the matter be doubtful; especially if the Defender offer a Daller to be forefault, as an <hi>Amande,</hi> if his Alledgence be not sustained.</p>
            <p>Before an Interlocutor be reported, the Process is brought to the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who peruseth the same, and prepares it for the Lords. And either Party give their <hi>Informations</hi> to the Lords containing the deduction and favour of the Cause, and the Dispute, which they may inlarge by reasons in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations as much as they please: but may alledge no matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> by way of <hi>Defense</hi> or <hi>Reply,</hi> but what was proponed at the Bar.</p>
            <p>The Ordinary doth the next Day, or soon after, relate the Cause, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pete the Dispute to the Lords. And if he find any matter of <hi>Fact</hi> in the Parties Informations, which was not proponed at the Bar, he either hears them again upon it, or he reports and shows to the Lords, that it was not proponed. And if they find any thing weighty therein, they will desire him to hear the Parties upon it, either before Interlocutor, or after, as they see cause. Upon report of the Dispute, the Points that any of the Lords think material, are stated and ordered, and any of the Lords reason thereanent. And if they be not unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, the Points whereupon they differ, go to the Vote. And then the Ordinary causeth call the Parties in the <hi>Outer-house,</hi> and reports the <hi>Interlocutor,</hi> (which is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuted by the principal Clerk,) and declares what the Lords sustain or repel.

And thereafter, if by <hi>Bill</hi> they represent any new matter of moment, the same of course is appointed to come to the Ordinary, and he will hear them thereupon. And if he refuse them, the Lords upon hearing of the Bill, if they find cause, will ordain the Ordinary, or some other, to hear it. Each Ordinary doth also order the extending of Acts, whereof either Party gets a <hi>Scroll</hi> before they be extracted. And if they differ, the Ordinary determines the same according to the <hi>Minuts,</hi> and meaning of the Lords.

There ariseth oftimes upon this occasion, the competition of many Rights, which are mutually interchanged, and every one of the Parties admitted for their interest, must see the <hi>Productions</hi> of all the rest. In which case, the Lords do frequently ordain all Parties, to produce such Writs as they will make use of in the Cause, with Certification that they shall not be heard to produce any thereafter: which nevertheless extends only to such Writs as they then have in their power. And then the principal Cause proceeds, and is either referred to some of the Lords to be heard in the afternoon: or otherwise, the Ordinary sees and compares the <hi>Productions</hi> of the Parties, and at the calling of the Cause, he declares what he finds evident and clear, as to the <hi>Preference.</hi> And then ordereth the Parties to dispute, allowing the <hi>second</hi> Right to be first dispute, with that which he finds <hi>preferable</hi>; and which of them prevails, the rest in order, to compete therewith untill all be discussed, and <hi>one only</hi> be preferred: or otherwise, some of them <hi>jointly,</hi> or some of them <hi>primo loco,</hi> and others <hi>secundo loco,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Competition of Rights, doth also come in by <hi>Double Poinding:</hi> and that either by way of <hi>Suspension,</hi> or <hi>Action</hi>; whereby the several Parties are cited to produce their Rights, and to hear and see, it found and declared, who hath the <hi>best Right</hi>; that thereby the Parties liable, may be out of hazard.</p>

As if one offer to prove <hi>violently spuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zied</hi> and taken away by <hi>force,</hi> the other Party alledgeth <hi>voluntarly delivered</hi> and taken away by <hi>consent</hi>; the question will be, Who shall be preferred in Probation? wherein the common Rule is, That where the Defense is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Libel, he that is <hi>in libello</hi> is preferred. But even there, and in all Cases, the most <hi>special</hi> and <hi>pregnant</hi> Probation is preferred. As in <hi>Spuilzies,</hi> the Pursuer libels <hi>violence,</hi> the Defender offers to prove <hi>lawfully poinded,</hi> which is contrary; yet being to be proven by Writ, (<hi>viz.</hi> by the <hi>Executions</hi> of the <hi>Poind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>) the Defender is preferred. Thereafter, the Parties are ordained particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to condescend on the <hi>Circumstances,</hi> and sometimes on the <hi>Witnesses Names,</hi> that the most <hi>special</hi> Condescendence, and the most <hi>unsuspect</hi>

and must not admit new Probation or new Alledgences in <hi>Fact,</hi> competent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Act; but the <hi>Act before Answer</hi> stands, as an Act of <hi>Litiscontestation,</hi> in all Points, and hath the same Terms to prove, with <hi>Litiscontestation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Acts of <hi>Litiscontestation,</hi> not only the Points to be proven are determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but also the manner of Probation: which is either by <hi>Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Writ, Oath of Party,</hi> or <hi>Witnesses.</hi> Presumptions are not put to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation in the future, but are cogno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ced in the very Act, and instantly verified; though from the Probation it self, Presumption may arise. And therefore the manner of Probation is ordinarly appropriat to <hi>Writ, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi> and <hi>Oath of Party,</hi> and that which is <hi>presumed,</hi> is said to need no Probation.</p>
            <p>Presumptions are of three sorts, either <hi>juris &amp; de jure,</hi> or <hi>juris,</hi> or <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis. Praesumptio juris &amp; de jure,</hi> is that which the Law determineth and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth upon the Point of Right: which is so strong, that it is a full Proof, and admits no <hi>contrary Probation.</hi> Unto which is reduced <hi>fictio juris,</hi> that which the Law, for utilities sake, presupposeth to <hi>be,</hi> and holdeth to be <hi>true,</hi> though it be not. So the Heir is presumed to be <hi>one Person</hi> with his <hi>Predecessor,</hi> and the <hi>Defunct's Possession</hi> is esteemed the <hi>Heir`s Possession,</hi> whereby whatever was possessed by the Defunct, if it was not effectually transmitted, is repute as possest by the Heir, though he exercise no <hi>possessory</hi> act either of body or mind thereanent. Most of our <hi>Certifications</hi> are founded upon such Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: as a Writ is improven <hi>for not production,</hi> upon this Presumption, that the Defender keepeth it up, because he knows it is <hi>forged</hi>; and therefore it is <hi>declared</hi> to be forged. Which Presumption doth not admit contrary Probation. So a Partie`s being holden <hi>as confess`d</hi> is founded upon the Presumption, that by his <hi>Oath,</hi> he could not deny the <hi>truth</hi> of what is alledged. So the <hi>using</hi> of <hi>false Writs proprio nomine,</hi> without Protestation, expressing <hi>the way how the Vsers came by them,</hi> is a Presumption of their being <hi>accessory</hi> to the <hi>Forgery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Praesumptio juris,</hi> is when the Presumption is acknowledged in <hi>Law,</hi> but <hi>admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth contrary Probation.</hi> So Dispositions of <hi>Moveables, Tacks,</hi> &amp;c. made to a Rebell`s <hi>Bairns, Friends,</hi> or <hi>Servants,</hi> are presumed by Act of Parliament to be <hi>fraudulent,</hi> and to the behoof of the Rebel: yet so as the contrary may be proven, if any equivalent Cause be instructed. In like manner Dispositions of <hi>Lands, &amp;c.</hi> made by Persons Bankrupt, or <hi>insolvent,</hi> are presumed by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Par.</hi> to be fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and in prejudice of Creditors, without an equivalent onerous cause. And albeit in themselves, they bear expresly an <hi>onerous cause,</hi> either <hi>generally,</hi> or <hi>particularly</hi> for Sums of Mony, or Deeds done; yet when granted in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>conjunct</hi> and <hi>confident Persons,</hi> they are presumed to be without <hi>a true</hi> onerous cause, and the Rights themselves, bearing the same, are not trusted: albeit the <hi>contrary</hi> may be proven, by instructing the onerous cause, for which they were granted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Praesumptio judicis,</hi> called also <hi>praesumptio hominis,</hi> is that Presumption which is not expresly in <hi>Law,</hi> but the just Deduction or Consequence, admitted by the Judge. This Presumption doth more easily admit contrary Probation: and therefore such Presumptions are said, to transfer the <hi>onus probandi</hi>; that is to say, they prove sufficiently for the Adducer, unless the contrary be proven, in which case, <hi>presumptio cedit veritati,</hi> in comparison whereof it is said to be but <hi>veri similitudo, verisimilis veritas,</hi> or <hi>conjectura.</hi> And yet it is not necessary, that either of the two Alledgences of the Parties, must be <hi>true</hi>; but that which ought to be, is <hi>presumed,</hi> albeit it be not <hi>certain</hi>: according to the Maxime of Law, <hi>quod inesse debet, inesse presumitur.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:100573:11"/>In all Summons and Acts, as there is a <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Command</hi> of the Judge; so there ought to be a <hi>Certification,</hi> certifying what the Judge will do, if his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand be not obeyed, as the sting in all Processes, without which they would be long of coming to an Issue. For if nothing could be done, but the <hi>charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, denouncing,</hi> and <hi>incarceration</hi> of the Party, (if he were found,) until he gave <hi>Obedience,</hi> or declaring him <hi>Fugitive,</hi> or denouncing him <hi>Rebel,</hi> or Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law for his Contumacy; litle benefit would thence arise to the other Party, and the contumacious Party might long stand out. And therefore more expedite Certifications are invented, of which we have as many, as apposite, and as effectual as any Nation whatsoever. Of which we shall adduce the prime instances.</p>
            <p>The first and most general <hi>Certification</hi> is, That the Lords will proceed <hi>to do Justice.</hi> Whereupon when Defenders appear not, they do proceed to <hi>Litiscontestation,</hi> and do admit Probation, and give Sentence, as if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender did appear.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> had no such Certification, and therefore unless the Defender were compearing <hi>willingly,</hi> or by <hi>compulsion,</hi> they could do nothing, but (in some Cases) put the Pursuer in Possession.</p>
            <p>Neither can the <hi>English</hi> give any Sentence against a Partie absent: but if he compear not, they do no more, but give out an <hi>Outlawry</hi> against him, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that since he will not obey Law, he shall not have the benefit of Law, in any Case. As Judges in <hi>Criminal</hi> Causes in <hi>Scotland</hi> commonly do, if the Defender compear not, they declare them <hi>Fugitive,</hi> which is <hi>Out-law:</hi> whereby his Escheat falls. But our Civil Certification is more equal and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite: seing thereby the Lords in contumacious Defenders <hi>absence,</hi> do the same that they would if they were <hi>present.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>next</hi> general Certification is, either in Summons or Acts, against Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cited to give their Oaths, with express certification, That if they compear not and depone, they shall be holden <hi>as confess`d:</hi> that is, as if they compear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confessed that which is alledged against them. Which is a most <hi>usual</hi> Certification, and concludes more Processes than all the other. It is also very <hi>important,</hi> and will be hardly rescinded: and therefore it is not sustained, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be particularly expressed, and unless the Party be cited by a <hi>Messenger of Arms,</hi> and be <hi>personally apprehended,</hi> that so his <hi>contumacy</hi> may be palpable.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> ordinary Certification is, against Parties (who have intented any Process,) to <hi>insist,</hi> with Certification, That if they insist not they shall never be heard <hi>thereafter.</hi> Which is of great use; for thereby Defenders put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to <hi>certainty,</hi> and are not obliged still to attend the motion of the Pursuer, who may readily wait his opportunity of the <hi>infancy,</hi> or <hi>evil condition</hi> of the Defender`s Heir, and insist against him when he is least able to defend himself; and letting the Process sleep, may so continue it, were it never so long. In opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, either this Certification, or a Declarator of Right may be intent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Defender, to determine the Cause, whilst he finds himself in a capacity.</p>
            <p>There is another Certification in the case, when the Lords by hearing any Debate, do <hi>before answer,</hi> ordain the Writs by which either Party will prove what they have alledged, to be produced; with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, That they shall not be heard <hi>thereupon</hi> thereafter: and that their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgence
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100573:12"/>
shall be holden as <hi>not proponed.</hi> And more generally, at the entry of several Causes, especially in the Competition of many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arties, and many Rights, the Lords ordain all the Parties to produce such Writs as they have in the Cause, with certification, That they shall not be heard thereafter. But in regard the Terms of Production are not granted so frequently, and so large as in other Cases; the Lords do extend the Certification no further, than as to such Writs as the Parties have in their hands, the time of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Certification. Whereupon they do sometimes ordain the Parties to depone, and if not, if any Party produce and alledge upon a Writ, not produced before the Certificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was admitted; if the Certification be alledged against the same, it will be rejected. But if the Producer offer to make faith, he had it not the time of the Certification, it will be admitted.</p>
            <p>Sometimes no particular Certification will be exprest, but the Act bear, <hi>With Certification,</hi> &amp;c. And the effect thereof is, that the Lords do admit thereupon such Certification as is just, and ordinary in such Cases. But if there be no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Certification in such Cases, the Act is ineffectual. As also other Acts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein, through negligence, no Certification is exprest; unless the fulfilling the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of the Act concern the Pursuer. In which case he will get no Process, till he fulfil the same: which is equivalent to Certification.</p>
            <p>In stead of Certification, the Law sometimes allows <hi>Protestation:</hi> which differeth from Certification in this, that the Certification which is exprest in the Summons, or Act, besides that which is not ordinary nor proper to be so insert, is sometimes admitted by way of Protestation. And albeit it be free for every Party to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test for what he pleaseth, yet only a few Protestations use to be admitted; such as Protestations at the instance of Defenders, upon the <hi>short Copies</hi> of Suspensions or Summons: wherein albeit there be no Certification, That if the Pursuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear not to insist the Defender shall be freed from the Instance; yet the Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er`s Protestation, as being just and ordinary, is instantly admitted, as effectually as if there had been a Certification in the Summons, That if the Pursuer did not insist, he should fall from that Instance.</p>
            <p>Such is the Protestation lately introduced in favour of the Pursuer, whereby upon the <hi>large Copy</hi> of the Summons, if the Defender refuse to produce the Process, the Pursuer protests, That the Copy may be holden as a <hi>Principal,</hi> and that the same may be holden as <hi>instructed,</hi> and <hi>proven,</hi> and Decreet pronounced. Which Protestation the Lords admit, in respect of <hi>the Contumacy</hi> of the Defender's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, who refuseth to produce the Pursuer`s Process.</p>
            <p>Such also is the Protestation of the Pursuer after Probation, at the Conclusion of the Cause, whereby when the Defender has produced his Writs, or Witnesses, conform to the Act of <hi>Litiscontestation,</hi> he protests, That he may be admitted <hi>to produce no more,</hi> and that <hi>the Cause may be holden as concluded:</hi> which Protestation the Ordinary admitteth, whereby the Cause is concluded; and neither Party can use further Probation regularly. So the Lords will advise whether the points whereupon <hi>Litiscontestation</hi> was made, be proven, or not proven.</p>
            <p>In other Cases either Party may protest what they please: but their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation receives no present Answer. The greatest use it hath is, that it be not presumed those who protest, do acquiesce by their <hi>silence: nam qui si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let consentire videtur.</hi> And therefore when one of the Parties makes any such Protestation, the other Party useth ordinarly to protest <hi>in the contrary</hi>: and there is no Answer given to either of their Protestations: but they use to be insert, unless they be clearly contrary to Law; in which case they will not be suffered to be in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rt. As if the Parties should protest, at the Sentence of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100573:12"/>
Lords, <hi>for remede of Law,</hi> or should protest, That the Lords <hi>should not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi>; these, being against their <hi>supreme Iurisdiction,</hi> will not be insert: but other Protestations will. As if any Reason of Suspension be repelled, as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent</hi> in a <hi>Suspension</hi>; the Suspender may protest, The same may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to him to use <hi>Reduction.</hi> Or if any Defense be repelled, as <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent</hi> in the <hi>first Instance</hi>; the Defenders may protest, That it be without prejudice to them, to make use thereof in the <hi>second Instance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> by <hi>Suspension,</hi> or <hi>Reduction.</hi> Or if any Right be reduced, or redeemed; the Defenders may protest, That it be without prejudice to them of any <hi>other</hi> Right, whereby they may brook the Lands, or thing in controversy. Which, is especially done when the Lords do not express in the Sentence such Reservations, as oftimes they do; and though they be omitted they are implyed in the nature of the thing. But least the <hi>silence</hi> of the Parties might import, they pretend no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they may for their further security protest.</p>
            <p>Protestations are only competent, where Certifications, Defenses, Replys, or Duply's are not competent. And therefore Protestations upon <hi>Copies</hi> as aforesaid, and at the <hi>Conclusion of the Cause,</hi> and upon <hi>incompetency</hi> of <hi>Defenses, Replys, Duplys,</hi> &amp;c. are only competent. For if these other were compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Prote<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tations were neither <hi>proper,</hi> nor effectual. As if when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender`s <hi>Defenses,</hi> or some of his <hi>Reasons</hi> of <hi>Suspension</hi> are discuss'd; if Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station were made, That the Defender might be heard upon other Defenses, or upon the Reasons not discussed; this Protestation, albeit insert, would be of no effect, because contrary to Law, which obliges all Parties to propone all the Defenses and Reasons, that they have, before <hi>Litiscontestation.</hi> And therefore in the second Instance, <hi>new</hi> ones are repelled, as <hi>competent</hi> and <hi>omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> So that to protest for liberty to <hi>omit,</hi> or <hi>add</hi> in a posterior Instance, is against Law: and those Alledgences being competent in the first Instance, ought to be <hi>proponed,</hi> not <hi>protested for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Processes come in before the Lords in the <hi>second Instance,</hi> by <hi>Advocation</hi> or <hi>Suspension</hi>: and both in the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second</hi> Instance by <hi>Reduction.</hi> For Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of <hi>Decreets</hi> or <hi>Acts</hi> are in the second Instance: but Reductions of <hi>Rights,</hi> whereupon no Decreet or Sentence hath followed, are in the first instance. Of these therefore in order.</p>
            <p>The original of Advocations is this. Of old, Parties were allowed to <hi>appeal</hi> from <hi>inferior,</hi> to <hi>superior</hi> Courts, when they conceived themselves to have gotten wrong, which was called <hi>Falsing of Dooms.</hi> And so there lay an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from <hi>Barons</hi> to <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> and from Sheriffs to the Kings <hi>ordinary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> in whose place the <hi>Colledge of Iustice</hi> succeeded, and the Senators of which are therefore designed Lords of <hi>Council and Session,</hi> from whom there is no Appeal to <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Parliament.</hi> By these Appeals, Processes did stop, till the Appeals were determined or deserted. And the Superior Court to which the Appeal was made, did first determine the Appeal, whether <hi>bene vel malè appellatum.</hi> The Cause was <hi>remitted</hi> to the Judge appeall'd from, unless the Appeal were sustained; in which case the Judge appeall'd unto, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded</hi> in the principal Cause: as is yet accustomed in most Nations. But Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals have been of a long time excluded in this Kingdom in any Case, and a far better Remedy introduced in their place, by <hi>Advocation.</hi> For by Appeals Processes were stopt, at the option and fancy of private Parties, which could not but increase animosity and clamour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:100573:13"/>Advocations proceed upon Supplication to the Lords, containing the special Reasons for which the inferior Judge is <hi>incompetent, unequal</hi> or <hi>unjust:</hi> and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that therefore the Cause ought to be <hi>advocat,</hi> or called from him, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Lords, or other competent and unsuspect Judges. Which Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do not pass of course, but are specially advised by the Ordinary upon the Bills, who considers not only the <hi>Relevancy</hi> of the Reasons of Advocation, but the <hi>Instructions</hi> thereof. For seing the Party complaining, hath another Remedy, by <hi>Suspension,</hi> and <hi>Reduction</hi>; Advocation is not to be granted, unless the Reasons be not only relevant, but instructed. In which the Testificates of known Persons of Reputation, will be sufficient to obtain Advocation, though not to determine the Cause. As if the Defender alledge, That he is not within the <hi>Jurisdiction,</hi> or that the Judge is of such <hi>relation</hi> to the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or that there is open <hi>enimity</hi> betwixt them: and in all Cases of difficulty, the Ordinary adviseth with the Lords. And if any Party appear, he will get a sight of the Bill of Advocation, and be heard thereupon: and oftimes the Lords will warrant the <hi>Reasons</hi> of Advocation to be <hi>discuss`d upon the Bill,</hi> and sometimes the <hi>principal</hi> Cause.</p>
            <p>The Lords do sometimes prohibite any Advocation to <hi>pass,</hi> but <hi>in presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> during the sitting of the <hi>Session,</hi> or by <hi>three Lords</hi> met together in <hi>Vacance,</hi> especially near the close of the Session: that Justice be not delayed, or the inferior Judge discouraged, or prejudged.</p>
            <p>The same Reasons, that were of old for Appeals, are now for Advocations. As <hi>first,</hi> That the Cause belongs not to the inferior Court`s Jurisdiction: as when Causes are advocat from Commissaries, as not being <hi>consistorial</hi>; or when any inferior Court is proceeding to determine <hi>Declarators</hi> of <hi>Property,</hi> or other <hi>important Rights,</hi> or the <hi>Competitions</hi> or <hi>Nullities</hi> thereof. <hi>Secondly,</hi> When the Complainer is not within that Judge's <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> but hath his Domicile and Residence elsewhere. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When the Complainer is <hi>exempted</hi> from that Judge`s Jurisdiction, or hath the <hi>priviledge</hi> of Advocation by Office, (as the members of the Colledge of Justice have by Statute, because of their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the Session.) And sometimes upon gross <hi>Inequality</hi> and <hi>Injustice,</hi> Exemptions are granted to the Persons injured, not to be conveenable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Judge. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If the Judge be nearly <hi>related</hi> to the other Party: whereof the <hi>Degree</hi> is not determined, but in <hi>arbitrio judicis.</hi> It is certain if he be <hi>Father,</hi> or <hi>Brother</hi> to the Party, he may be <hi>declined:</hi> and if he repell the <hi>Declinator,</hi> Advocation will be granted, both upon <hi>Incompetency</hi> and <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> For by Act of Parliament, the Lords are declined, if they be of any of those Relations to the other Party. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If the Judge be a <hi>Party,</hi> or have any <hi>interest</hi> in the <hi>Cause. Sixthly,</hi> If he have showen any <hi>malice,</hi> or <hi>enmity</hi> against the Complainer. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> If he have committed any <hi>Iniquity,</hi> by <hi>repelling</hi> any relevant or competent Alledgence, or <hi>sustaining</hi> that which is irrelevant, or incompetent, against the Complainer.</p>
            <p>These, or like Reasons of Advocation, being found relevant, and instructed; Letters of Advocation are pass'd under the Signe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> commanding the inferior Judge to proceed no further, but to send the Process and all that hath been done therein, to the Lords: for which a Term is assigned. Which being past, the Pursuer of the principal Cause, and Defender in the Advocation, gives in to the Clerk a short Copy of the Advocation, and craves <hi>Protestation and Remit:</hi> which is admitted of course by the Clerk, if none compear to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100573:13"/>
the Advocation. But if any appear, some Dayes after are assigned to him to produce, which is marked by the Clerk upon the <hi>Copy:</hi> and being again called, with <hi>certification,</hi> That if he do not then produce, Protestation will be admitted, and the Cause remitted to the inferior Judge; at that time, if he produce not, Protestation will be admitted.</p>
            <p>If the principal Advocation be produced, the same is given up to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender: against whom, if he do not return it within <hi>four Dayes,</hi> together with the Clame before the inferior Judge, Protestation is admitted. But if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn it, the same is inrolled in the <hi>Roll of Advocations,</hi> according to the Date of the <hi>Return.</hi> And when it comes to be called by the Ordinary, the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer of the principal Cause produces his Clame, with the Copy of the Advoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was returned; and craves <hi>Protestation, and Remit:</hi> which (if the Raiser of the Advocation do not compear, or insist not in his Advocation) is according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted.</p>
            <p>But if the Raiser of the Advocation compear, and insist, the Advocate for the Pursuer of the Principal Cause, doth briefly relate the Cause, and before what inferior Court it was pursued, and craves it to be <hi>remitted:</hi> and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for the Raiser of the Advocation, repetes his Reasons of Advocation, for which he alledgeth the Cause ought to be <hi>advocat</hi> to the Lords; which stand mainly in the Points before adduced.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reason</hi> of Advocation, upon <hi>Incompetency</hi> of the Judge, is most ordinary: and that either in regard of a <hi>personal</hi> Priviledge of the Party conveened, as in the case of the Members of the Colledge of Justice, who by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have the priviledge, that they may advocat their Causes from any infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Court, to the Lords; or in regard of the <hi>matter:</hi> so no inferior Judge is competent to discuss the <hi>Nullities</hi> of any Right, neither are they competent to <hi>Declarators of Escheat,</hi> and several other Actions. The Reason of Incompetency may also be founded upon the Parties not being within the <hi>Iurisdiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All these Reasons of Incompetency are elided, by the Partie`s compearing and <hi>proponing</hi> any <hi>Defense,</hi> except it were a <hi>Declinator.</hi> For by proponing any other Defense, he acknowledges and homologates the Authority of the Judge: and therefore cannot question the same, upon the point of <hi>Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the Incompetency arise upon the matter in question, which did not not appear at first, but appeared thereafter, upon the Debate of the Parties; as if the Cause dipped upon the <hi>discussing</hi> and <hi>competition</hi> of different heritable Rights; or if there arise a Debate upon the <hi>Nullity</hi> of any Right: in these Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, compearance, and acknowledgement of the Auctority, will not exclude the Reason of Advocation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reason</hi> of Advocation upon <hi>suspition</hi> of the Judge, as too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed in the one Party, or too much unfriend to the other; stands much in the arbitrement of the Lords: the precise Degree of Consanguinity or Affinity, or the acts of Enmity, not being determinat in Law. And it is the same in the case where there are more Judges, and the Reason meets but with some of them: or only with the Deputes, or some of them, or only with the Clerk.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:100573:14"/>When the Reasons of Advocation are dubious, sometimes the Pursuer of the principal Cause, and sometimes the Ordinary, will offer to the Raiser of the Advocation, <hi>to advocat of Consent</hi>; provided the Pursuer of the principal Cause, will dispute the Cause <hi>instantly,</hi> or otherwise will dispute the same without further sight of the principal Process, or extracting an <hi>Act of Advoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For when otherwise the Parties advocat of Consent, they are to do it when the Clerk calls: and there must be an Act extracted upon the Consent.</p>
            <p>If the Cause be advocat upon the Relevancy of the Reasons, the same must be instantly instructed: and if they consist <hi>in facto,</hi> as the <hi>Residence</hi> of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the <hi>Affinity</hi> or <hi>Enmity</hi> of the Judge; the Raiser of the Advocation ought either to have Witnesses instantly ready to prove, or at least Testificaets of Persons above exception, and known to the Lords. For there the question is not, for deciding of the principal Cause.</p>
            <p>Advocations are hardly sustained, after <hi>Litiscontestation</hi> before inferior Courts, unless it be upon the Reason of <hi>Iniquity,</hi> which is alwayes sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and doth sometimes with one breath, determine both the Advocation and principal Cause.</p>
            <p>The Cause being advocat, either of Consent, or by Authority of the Judge, the principal Cause advocat, being seen by the Raiser of the Advocation, (thereby become Defender of the Cause) together with the Act of Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation extracted; then it comes in as an ordinary Cause, in the first Instance. But the Defender will be reponed, and heard upon any Defense, which was unj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stly repelled to him, by the inferior Court, and upon any other he pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: because one being unjustly repelled, he was not obliged to propone any further.</p>
            <p>The order in discussing of <hi>Suspensions</hi> is thus. The Charger against whom the Suspension is obtained, after the Day of compearance in the Suspension is past, gives a short <hi>Copy</hi> of the Suspension to a Clerk, and causeth call it in the Outer-House. If none compear for the Suspender, <hi>Protestation</hi> is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of course.</p>
            <p>If an Advocate compear for the Suspender, then the Clerk assigns a short Day to him to produce the principal Suspension: and at that same time the Charger may give him out the Charge, being the Decreet, or Sentence, obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The first Diet being come, the Clerk calls the Copy again, and assigns a second shorter Time, with certification, That if he produce not, Protestation will be admitted. And then calls the third time, and if the principal Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension be not produced, with the Charge (if it was given out in time) Protestation is admitted. All which is marked by the Clerk, on the back of the Copy, and being put in the <hi>Minut-Book</hi> and read, it may be extracted the next Day. But during that time, the Production of the <hi>Principal,</hi> with the <hi>Charge</hi> to the Party, Clerk, or Keeper of the <hi>Minut-Book,</hi> will stop the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation. The which order is also used for <hi>getting back</hi> of Advocations, and <hi>seing</hi> the <hi>principal Cause,</hi> if it be given out when the Copy is first called.</p>
            <p>The Charger's Advocate, at the giving out of the Charge, writeth on the back thereof, the <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi> that it was <hi>given out,</hi> and sets his name thereto: and is not obliged to receive the Suspension, unless the Suspender mark on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100573:14"/>
That he hath <hi>seen and returned</hi> the same; but may take out his Protestation, as if the Principal were not produced.</p>
            <p>According to the Date, of the Return of the Charge, the Suspension is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled</hi>: and when it comes to be discuss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>s Advocate produce not. Yet sometimes, the Charger`s Advocate will hold the <hi>Copy</hi> for a <hi>Principal,</hi> and the Suspender will repete his <hi>Reasons of Suspension</hi>: which though they be not admittable upon a short Copy, in strict form, (because all Reasons of Suspension, both <hi>principal</hi> and <hi>eked,</hi> ought to be set down in <hi>Writ,</hi> and given to the Charger to <hi>see</hi>;) yet frequently, the Charger will rather dispute the Cause, than take a Protestation, which is easily suspended again: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will answer to the Reasons, as verbally repeted.</p>
            <p>But if the Suspender compear, and the Charger do not insist, he may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the principal Suspension, and <hi>crave the Letters to be suspended ay and while the Charge be produced:</hi> which puts him <hi>in tuto,</hi> that no Protestation can be taken upon the Copy, till the Charge be produced. Yea, if the Suspender extract and produce the Charge, and refer his Reasons to the Lords; they will advise the same: and if they find the Reasons relevant, and proven, will suspend the Letters <hi>simpliciter.</hi> In which case, the Decreet of Suspension is as other Decreets <hi>in absence</hi>; and may be reduced upon a Summons of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction: wherein the Lords will reconsider the Reasons, and hear the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties debate thereupon; and may recall what they formerly did, albeit <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per eisdem deductis:</hi> which they cannot do in Decreets upon <hi>compearance.</hi> But when the Defender is absent, the Lords do not so accurately consider the Cause, seing there is a Remedy: and likewise because, albeit they find the Reasons relevant, as before; the Party may elide the same by relevant An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers and Duplys.</p>
            <p>If the Charger compear, and also the Suspender, and the principal Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is produced; then the Charger doth briefly repete his Charge, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet suspended, and declares what he insists in. And if there be any thing <hi>general,</hi> he useth to give in a <hi>Condescendence</hi> in writ, at the beginning, to be <hi>seen</hi> with the Charge; which therefore is called the <hi>special Charge.</hi> And if the Charge have in it many Members, he declares what Points he insists in <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo loco:</hi> and if he do not, the Suspender may insist upon any Reason of Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he pleaseth, against any of the Points.</p>
            <p>The Suspender in repeting his Reason, should condescend by the <hi>number,</hi> what Reason it is; and whether it be <hi>libelled</hi> or <hi>eked.</hi> For Suspenders may add or eke to their libelled <hi>Reasons,</hi> if they will. So that if the Reason they repete, be neither eked nor libelled, in strict form, it may be repelled: or if the eked Reason hath not been at first produced, and <hi>seen,</hi> with the Suspensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it ought not to be received. Yet many times the Ordinary will indulge that favour, and cause the Charger either answer it instantly, or take it up till a Day, to <hi>see:</hi> which he may do, without expunging of the Cause out of the <hi>Roll</hi>; but may call the Cause again at the Day appointed. And if the Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath seen the Reason, may proceed.</p>
            <p>In like manner, Reasons of Suspension ought to be <hi>instantly verified</hi> by <hi>Writ,</hi> unless they be referred to the Partie`s <hi>Oath:</hi> in which case, the Charger's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curators,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100573:15"/>
to hasten the Process, will take a Day to produce the Charger to give his Oath. But if the Reason of Suspension be founded upon a Writ, which is not the Suspenders own Writ; as when Cautioners suspend upon Discharges granted to the principal Debitor: the Suspender will get a Term <hi>to prove</hi>; as he will, when the Reasons of Suspension consist <hi>in facto,</hi> and are to be proven by <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first point of Debate in Suspensions is, upon the <hi>Relevancy,</hi> and <hi>Verifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Reasons. The next point is, upon the <hi>Competency</hi> of the Reasons. For many Reasons are competent by way of Reduction, that are not compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent by way of Suspension; because Suspension stops the Execution of a Decreet already obtained: and therefore the Execution should not be delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except upon Reasons relevant, and a short Probation; but the Execution ought to proceed. And if the Decreet whereupon Execution pass'd, be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; all that hath been taken away by the Execution, will be recovered. So a Reason upon <hi>Minority</hi> and <hi>Laesion,</hi> is not receivable by way of Suspension, but by Reduction. Neither a Reason upon <hi>Inhibition, Interdiction, Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Nullity</hi>; or upon any <hi>Clause irritant,</hi> not being <hi>declared</hi>; (albeit it bear to take effect <hi>without Declarator</hi>) except in few Cases.</p>
            <p>If the Reason of Suspension be sustained, then the Charger propones the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> to the Reason; which is so termed, to difference it from Defenses pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned in ordinary Actions: because the Reason of Suspension is a Defense in the principal Cause, and the Answer is a Reply thereto. The Answer being proponed, is first debated as to the <hi>Relevancy,</hi> and <hi>Competency</hi> thereof: but it needs not be <hi>instantly verified,</hi> because the Charger may delay himself. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are not <hi>competent</hi> by way of Answer, which are <hi>relevant</hi>: as upon <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdictions, Inhibitions, Minority,</hi> and most <hi>Nullities,</hi> and <hi>Clauses irritant,</hi> and <hi>Failzies</hi>; which require <hi>Reduction.</hi> But if the Suspender have a Reduction, and will hold the <hi>Production</hi> thereof <hi>satisfied</hi>; he may repete the Reasons by way of <hi>Answer,</hi> if coincident with his Reasons of Suspension. If the Answer be sustained, the Suspender may propone his <hi>Reply,</hi> which doth not consist in any Alledgence against the Relevancy or Competency of the Answer; but in some distinct Writ, Clause, or Fact, eliding the Answer, in the same way as the Answer did elide the Reason: and so the Charger insists in his <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi> and the Suspender may insist in his <hi>Triply,</hi> and the Charger in his <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druply,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Albeit the Suspender be obliged to verifie his Reasons of Suspension instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet he needs not instruct his Reply: because that ariseth upon the Charger's Answer, and he will get a Term to instruct the same, or his <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Reasons of Suspension, do not conclude to suspend the Letters <hi>simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer,</hi> and so take away the Decreet suspended <hi>for ever,</hi> but to suspend the same for a <hi>time</hi>; and then the Decreet of Suspension bears, <hi>The Lords suspend the Letters a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and while,</hi> &amp;c. Otherwise (when the Reasons conclude so, and are sustained) <hi>The Lords suspend the Letters simpliciter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If in discussing the Suspension, there be nothing admitted to be proven in the <hi>future,</hi> then the <hi>De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reet of Suspension</hi> follows: which is the common name both of Decreets in favour of Suspenders, and of Decreets in favour of Chargers, whereby the Lords find the Letters <hi>orderly proceeded,</hi> either
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100573:15"/>
               <hi>simply,</hi> or <hi>ay and while</hi> such a thing be done. And sometimes the Lords suspend the Letters for a <hi>part,</hi> and find the Letters orderly proceeded for the <hi>rest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any Point be admitted to be proven, either of the Reasons of Suspension, Reply, Duply, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether it be in favour of on of the Parties on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or of both, when they have different Points to be proven; then <hi>Litiscontestation</hi> is made, and an Act must be extracted, which is an Act of <hi>Litiscontestation.</hi> But ordinarly in Suspensions there is a present De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet.</p>
            <p>In all <hi>Reductions</hi> there are several things different from ordinary Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: for thereby Decreets, Acts, or other Rights are craved to be reduced or rescinded either upon <hi>Nullities</hi> therein, or upon Reasons <hi>in facto,</hi> or <hi>other Rights</hi> eliding the same, albeit of themselves they be not null. So that whatsoever is competent as a reason of Suspension, is much more competent as a Reason of Reduction: albeit many things be not competent by Suspension, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent by Reduction. And therefore when that occurrs, Suspenders use with the Suspension to raise a Reduction, that when the Suspension comes to be discuss'd, those things that are not competent by Suspension, may yet be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Suspension, because of the Reduction. Especially if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction be <hi>seen,</hi> and the Pursuer hold the <hi>production satisfied</hi> by the Charge. Then repeting his Reason of Suspension and Reduction as <hi>coincident,</hi> he will get the same Terms in both. But if he will not hold the production satisfied by the Charge, then he must debate the Reason of Suspension alone: and if they be not found competent, and sufficiently instructed; the Letters will be found <hi>orderly proceeded</hi> in the Suspension, <hi>reserving the Reduction as accords.</hi> And if the Reduction be seen, and be probable to be soon ready, and upon relevant Grounds; then the Decreet upon the Suspension will be suspended to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted for a time, that in the mean while the Suspender may insist in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction: which sometimes is prorogat upon Supplication as the Lords see cause. And when the Decreet of Suspension is extracted, if there be Reduction de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending; the Suspender doth oftimes obtain a <hi>second</hi> Suspension, that he may conclude his Reduction, but the giving or extracting the second Decreet of Suspension is seldom delayed upon a Reduction, which was either not rised, or not ready, the time of discussing the first Suspension.</p>
            <p>In Reductions the <hi>Will</hi> commanding the Defender to be cited, is put in the first place; and then the Writs called for to be reduced, in the next: and last, the Reasons of Reduction, (which with the Writs called for, are left blank ordinarly at the raising of the Reduction, and filled up afterwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be given out to be <hi>seen</hi>) containing such Reasons as the Pursuer knows, relating in <hi>partic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lar</hi> to the Writs called for, and such other <hi>general</hi> Reasons as commonly may be alledged against any Writ; as wanting <hi>Witnesses,</hi> or the <hi>Designation</hi> of them, or wanting the Designation of the <hi>Writer,</hi> or being <hi>vitiat</hi> in the <hi>Date,</hi> or other <hi>Substantials</hi>; which are libelled, mainly, to compell the Defender to <hi>produce:</hi> because he is obliged to produce no Writ, but such against, which there is a Reason libelled. But after the Writs cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for are produced, the Pursuer useth to cut the Summons, and to libel such Reasons as he sees thence emergent: whereupon the Dispute fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100573:16"/>But because Certifications upon <hi>Reductions</hi> alone, do only conclude the Writs called for, to be reduced <hi>ay and while they be produced,</hi> which will be sufficient until the Decreet of Reduction be reduced, and till in the Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the Writs reduced, be produced, (for till that time, no use can be made thereof, against that Right whereupon they were reduced;) and because the Certification in <hi>Improbations</hi> is far more absolute, and strong, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing That the Writs called for <hi>shall make no faith in Iudgement,</hi> but shall be repute as <hi>false</hi> and <hi>fenzied,</hi> because they were not produced, therefore in the same Libel, <hi>Reduction</hi> and <hi>Improbation</hi> are frequently joyned, whereby all the Writs called for, have a general Reason of <hi>Falshood</hi> libelled against them. Which Reason of Falshood may not be eiked in the Reduction, but the Improbation must be libelled upon a Bill pass'd with the concourse of His <hi>Majesties</hi> Advocat as in <hi>crimine falsi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The calling upon the Copy of Reductions, and obtaining Protestations by the Defender, is alike as in other Process. And when the Pursuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, if the Defender be absent, the Clerks calling the Summons of Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, do admit Certification of course: and if compearance be made, the Reduction with the Titles, Grounds, and Instructions thereof, are given out to the Defender's Advocat. And if they be not returned in due time, the Pursuer causeth call upon the large Copy, to reproduce the Process, against such a Day, and then assigns another Day, with Certification; and then admits Certification. Which may be extracted within twenty four Hours after it is read in the Minute-Book, unless the Process be reproduced. And that Decreet is the strongest of any of that kind, because Decreets of Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in Reductions and Improbations, require no Probation, but are gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the <hi>contumacy</hi> of the Defender, who refuseth to produce. And therefore that Certification is intended to force them to produce, since otherwise the Right will be <hi>reduced</hi> and <hi>improven,</hi> and be holden as false and fenzied.</p>
            <p>When Reductions are seen, returned, and inrolled, at the calling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the Ordinary, the Pursuer`s Advocat doth shortly relate his Title, and the Writs he calls for to be reduced, and improven <hi>generally,</hi> or <hi>particularly,</hi> and then craves Certification <hi>contra non producta.</hi> The Defender`s Advocat may also relate the Cause, and doth then propone his Defenses against the <hi>Executions,</hi> the Pursuers <hi>Title,</hi> or upon the <hi>Interest</hi> of either Party, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, That all Parties interessed <hi>are not called,</hi> and urgeth the Pursuer particularly to condescend on the Writs called for, and debates whether he hath interest by his Title produced, to call for them, either for <hi>reducing,</hi> or <hi>improving</hi> of them. Where there ariseth many important Debates, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discuss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, the Defender takes a Term to <hi>produce,</hi> and sometimes the Term is assigned <hi>Reserving all</hi> the Defenders Defenses against the <hi>Interest</hi> of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Alledgences against the <hi>Production:</hi> which Reservation continues till all the Terms of Production be run. And when Certification is granted <hi>contra non producta,</hi> if the Defender produce any thing, he will then be heard to dispute. Why he ought to produce <hi>no further:</hi> and that not only from the Interest of the Pursuer, whereby he cannot call for any other Writ than what is produced; but also upon the Ground, That the Defender hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <hi>sufficiently,</hi> to exclude all Rights produced by the Pursuer. In which Case the Lords will sometimes hear the Parties debate their Rights, even before the Production be closed: albeit it be more ordinary, and regular, that the Defender should produce what he can upon his hazard, and Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100573:16"/>
should be granted against the rest. So that all the Writs whereby the Defender can defend himself, being in the field, the Dispute may be clear, and intire: which otherwise may be drawn out into a very long endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Seing the Defender, if it be found that he hath not produced suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, may still drop in one single Writ, and renew the Debate thereupon, and alledge he hath now produced sufficiently, and make as many Disputes as he hath single Writs, contrary to the intent of this kind of Process, which is to force Defenders to produce all they have, before they begin to Dispute. But the Defender will not be heard after the first <hi>additional Production,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Certification: but if what he then produceth, doth unquestionably elide the Pursuers Production, he will be assolzied. But if the matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main any wayes dubious<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Lords will rather observe the ordinary Form, by concluding the Production first, and then falling upon the Reasons of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</p>
            <p>Before the Act of REGULATION there were <hi>two</hi> Terms allowed in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions</hi> and <hi>four</hi> in <hi>Improbations</hi> for production of the Writs called for. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>first Term</hi> of Production was come, and the Act extracted, the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer's Advocats caused the Clerk call thereupon, <hi>to satisfie the desire of the Act,</hi> and he upon calling it, assigned a Day for that purpose: and after that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the second time, and assigned some Diets more, with <hi>Certification.</hi> But he could go no further, till the Act was called by the Ordinary, who assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>second Term,</hi> whereupon a second Act was extracted. The Ordinary upon calling the second Act in the same manner as the first, was accustomed to assign a <hi>third Term,</hi> which being come, and a third Act extracted and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as aforesaid, if the matter were of consequence, and concerned the Right of many Lands, and that the Defender would take a <hi>fourth Term</hi> to close the <hi>Production</hi> of his own consent, the Ordinary did give him it: otherwise he would grant Certification <hi>contra non producta</hi> conditionally, That what the Defender produced betwixt and such a day should be received. Which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was only granted least the Parties and Advocats should be surprised. But since the Act of <hi>Regulation,</hi> there are only <hi>two Terms</hi> to produce in <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probations,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> in <hi>Reductions</hi>: which must be assigned by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reductions,</hi> unless when they are coincident with <hi>Suspensions,</hi> are to be discuss'd as to the <hi>Production</hi> in the <hi>Outer-House</hi>: but because of their importance, they are priviledged only to be discuss`d in the <hi>Inner-House,</hi> as to the <hi>Reasons</hi> of Reduction, unless the Lords upon Supplication grant Warrant to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to hear and discuss the same. And therefore when the <hi>Production</hi> is closed, and the <hi>Certification</hi> concluded, either by the Pursers holding the Production <hi>satisfied</hi> with what is produced, or by extracting the Certificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>contra non producta</hi>; the Cause is again called. but the Defender may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone his Defenses against the Production, which were reserved <hi>in initio litis,</hi> before Certification be extracted, or if he insist not therein, when the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer repetes his Reasons of Reduction, the Defender will refer the same to the Lords. And unless there be a Warrant to hear the Cause <hi>extra,</hi> the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary will only make a <hi>Great Avisandum</hi> to both Parties to be ready, to dispute the Reasons when the Lords call: and in the mean time, ordain the Defender to see his own <hi>Production</hi> in the Clerks hands, as he will be serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But if there be a Warrant to hear the Cause, he will give the Defender some time to revise his own Production in the Clerks hands, and be ready at the next Calling. This is called a <hi>Great Avisandum</hi> in opposition to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

            <p>The main Defense competent in <hi>Reduction</hi> besides those which are common to all other Actions, upon the <hi>Executions</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> are first, upon the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suers <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Production,</hi> That it cannot give him any interest to <hi>reduce,</hi> or <hi>improve</hi> any of the Writs called for. And if his interest be sustained, then the Defense runs upon registrat Writs. If they be registrat in the Books of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and Session, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>gistrat. But if they be registrat in inferior Courts, Certification will be granted, unless the Clerk of the Court be called. But if he be called, his not compearing, or not producing, is upon the hazard of the Defender: and the condescending on the Date of the Registration, will not be sufficient in that Case; but the Defender upon his own peril, must search for the principal, and produce them. But if the Writs alledged registrat in the Books of Session, be not found therein, according to the Condescendence; Certification will be admitted against the same.</p>
            <p>There is also an ordinary Defense against the Production of Apprisings, That the Charter and Seasin following thereupon, are produced; and that before the year 1624. Apprisings were left at the Signet, as Warrants thereof: so that no Certification can be granted against such. Neither will Certificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be granted against the Executions of <hi>Warnings,</hi> or other Executions of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which are small inconsiderable Papers, easely lost) if <hi>Reduction</hi> or <hi>Improbation</hi> be intented long after obtaining of Decreets. But the Registrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Seasins will not stop Certifications against them, because the principal Seasin is not left at the Register. The like holds in <hi>Reversions, Assignations</hi> and <hi>Fikes</hi> the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But Certification will not be admitted against Writs granted by the Pursuer's Predecessors, except such Predecessors to whom he is actually served Heir, <hi>immediately,</hi> or by <hi>progress.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It useth also to be alledged, that no Certification can be granted against the <hi>Writs</hi> called for, but such only against which a Reason is libelled: which is taken off when <hi>improbation</hi> is included. Because that Reason, <hi>That all the Writs called for, are forged false and fenzied,</hi> reacheth all: and where Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is not libelled, the common Alledgence upon <hi>Nullities,</hi> or the like, useth to be insert. And if a Reason be libelled that may reach them, the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer is not obliged to dispute, Whether the Reason be relevant ot not. And therefore as the Nullities upon the Subscription of original Rights, so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Nullities of registrat Writs are libelled, as being Acts or Decreets ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted contrary to the Warrant of the Judge.</p>
            <p>There uses also <hi>incident Diligences</hi> to be raised, and produced to stop Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. Which incident Diligences are Summons of <hi>Exhibition</hi> against the Havers of any of the <hi>Writs</hi> called for; especially against the Defenders Superiors, Authors, and others. For albeit the Superior, and other Authors might be called; yet if they compear not, the Defenders compearing ought not to lose their Rights. And therefore Law allows them time to use Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for recovering of their Rights, not only during the <hi>Terms</hi> of Produ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but also ay and while the <hi>Incident</hi> be discuss'd.</p>
            <p>But the Incident will seldom be sustained, for recovering the Defenders own Writs: because without consideration of the Dependence of the Process, he had sufficient interest to pursue the <hi>Exhibition,</hi> and <hi>Delivery</hi> of these; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they were common Writs, of the Defender's Lands and Rights, and of other Lands and Rights, the custody whereof did not belong to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by the <hi>agreement</hi> of Parties, or because he hath the <hi>lesser Interest:</hi> or unless the Defender be, or hath been <hi>minor,</hi> and the Writs in the hands of his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or Curators. So as it is the Defenders fault that he hath not his own Writs: and therefore cannot thereby delay the Pursuer, but must content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the ordinary <hi>Terms</hi> of Production.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Terms</hi> of Compearance in the <hi>Incident</hi> be not past before the <hi>Term</hi> of production in Reductions, or the <hi>first Term</hi> in Improbations; it will not be sustained, nor stop the course of the Action. But if the Incident be raised and execute <hi>debito tempore,</hi> and all Solemnities and Formalities exact therein, it will be sufficient: but in the mean time the ordinary <hi>Terms</hi> will proceed, not only for the Writs for which the Incident is sustained, but specially for all other Writs called for. For it were against reason, that after the Incident is ended, any Terms of Production as to these Writs should then be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Incident Diligences were formerly most tedious, expensive, and wearisome to Parties. For the user thereof might, for proving that the Party cited had the Writs he called for, make use of Witnesses; and thereby had four Terms to cite the Witnesses. And if thereby he obtained Decreet of Exhibition, he had Terms against the Havers, by Horning and Caption, and several Terms also against Magistrats to put the Caption in Execution. All which Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were ready to <hi>pretend</hi> necessary, when they <hi>knew</hi> there was nothing to be found, and did it only to procure delay.</p>
            <p>But by the Act of <hi>Regulation</hi> these Delays and Pretences are much cut off. For as the Subjects in every Society are oblieged to promove Justice, by bearing witness upon their Oaths, so are they oblieged to depone, whether they have any Writs that may prove the thing in controversie, and if they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the <hi>having</hi> thereof; they ought to <hi>exhibite</hi> them <hi>ad modum proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis.</hi> Therefore incident Diligences do now proceed by Horning against the alledged Havers, charging them to appear and depone whether they have the Writs called for, and to produce them in so far as they have them: and if they obey not the Charge of Horning, Letters of Caption are direct to incarcerat them, till they depone, and exhibite what they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>There be three sorts of Oaths: Oaths of <hi>Verity,</hi> Oaths of <hi>Calumny,</hi> and Oaths <hi>in litem.</hi> Oaths of Verity do <hi>affirm</hi> or <hi>deny,</hi> the truth of the point refered rhereto: wherein if the Deponent deny, he may either do it <hi>simply,</hi> or <hi>qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>e,</hi> so far as he <hi>knoweth</hi> or <hi>remembers</hi>; in which case his Oath will not exclude other Probation. But if his Oath be <hi>affirmative,</hi> he may not so <hi>qualifie</hi> the same.</p>
            <p>Oath of Calumny doth only require the Party to depone, That he doth not <hi>calumniously</hi> alledge any Point, <hi>knowing it not to be true:</hi> but that he <hi>believes</hi> it to be <hi>likely.</hi> And if by this Oath, he do not so assert the Point offered thereto, or be holden as confest for not deponing; it is a sufficient Probation against him. There is not so much consideration to be had in the Oath of Calumny, of the <hi>Iustice</hi> of any Point, which the Judge should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> but of the Partie's <hi>opinion</hi> of the <hi>verity</hi> thereof. For by our Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom Oaths of Calumny are not taken, till the Lords sustain the Relevancy. Nor are Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Terms of Probation being come, and bygone, either Party against whom any Point is to be proven, causeth the Clerk call the Act of <hi>Litiscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation,</hi> and the Advocats therein mentioned, and intimats to the parties <hi>to satisfie the Desire of the Act</hi>; and thereafter the Act is called by the Ordinary, before other Causes be discuss'd.</p>
            <p>The Act having been first intimat by the Clerk, and thereafter called by him before the Ordinary, the Advocats therein mentioned are called to the Bar, and then the Pursuer's Advocat craves, <hi>That the Term may be circumduced:</hi> and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times much time is spent in relating of the Cause, and Tenor of the Act; especially by the Defenders Advocats, who many times have need to bring themselves in remembrance of the Cause by speaking of it: for avoiding whereof, The Sub-clerk who calls the Act should peruse it, and be in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to relate to the Ordinary in a word, what is the Point to be proven: which may be done without so much as repeting the Process, but only the kind of the Action, and then whether the same, or a Defense Reply, or Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply was admitted, reading the <hi>interloqutory words</hi> of the Act, which expresses what was admitted to Probation.</p>
            <p>The ordinary <hi>terms</hi> accustomed in such Cases are, that the Advocats who cause call the Act craves, <hi>That the Term may be circumduced,</hi> or <hi>That certifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be granted,</hi> or specially, <hi>That the Party may be holden as confest,</hi> if that be the certification.</p>
            <p>Likewise the Pursuer causeth call the <hi>Act</hi> when any <hi>Defense, Duply,</hi> or <hi>Quadruply</hi> is admitted to the Defender's Probation. In which Case he craves, The Term to be circumduced against the Defender. As also, if the Pursuer be to prove the Point by the Defender's Oath, then he causeth call the Act and craves , The Defender to be holden as confest.</p>
            <p>If the Point, whether it be the Reply, or Triply, be to be proven by the Pursuer, then the Defender calls the Act and craves, The Term to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced against the Pursuer. Or if the Defender be to prove any thing by the Pursuer's Oath, then he craves, The Pursuer to be holden as confest. But if there be Points to be proven <hi>hinc inde,</hi> as if the Defence do not acknowledge the Libel; then if the Pursuer call the Act, albeit the Defender call not at the same time, yet he will alledge, That Certification cannot be admitted, until the Pursuer prove his own Libel, and prove the Quantities, or Prices: which will be either granted, or at least no Decreet can be granted, till the Pursuer's part be proven; and whatever the Defender produceth <hi>medio tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore,</hi> will be admitted: but regularly Certification should not be admitted. The same holds in other Points of the Process, to be proven by the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when the Defenses do not acknowledge the Points to be proven by the Pursuer. But if the Defense acknowledge not the Libel, nor the Reply the Defense; then if the Pursuer call, and renounce Probation as to his Libel, he may crave the Term to be circumduced for not proving the Defense, though he prove not the Reply, that being only necessary to be proven in case the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100573:19"/>
Defense be proven. As if the Defense be <hi>Compensation</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and the Reply be <hi>Recompensation</hi> or discharge of that Debt, whereupon the Compensation is called; if the Pursuer prove the Debt, he may crave the Term to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced against the Defender for not proving the Debt, whereupon he craves Compensation, albeit the Pursuer prove not the Reply. In this case also the Defender may crave the Term to be circumduced against the Pursuer, for not proving of his Libel, albeit the Defender prove not his Defense. But if the Pursuer adduce Probation, or use Diligence for proving of the Libel, the Defender cannot crave the Term to be circumduced against the Pursuer, for not proving his Reply, till the Defender prove his own Defense. The like holds in the Duply, or in any other Point.</p>
            <p>The Term may be circumduced, and yet no Decreet pronounced. As if the Pursuer have adduced probation of his Libel, Quantities, and Prices not acknowledged by the Defense, and renounced Probations, he may crave the Term to be circumduced against the Defender; to the effect the Cause may be <hi>concluded</hi> and <hi>advised.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Circumduction of the Term, or granting of Certifications, the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry useth to do it <hi>conditionally,</hi> That what shall be produced betwixt and such a time, shall be received: (especially if the Defender's Advocat declare, that the Writs called for, are not at present in his power, but that he expects the same) the time of which Qualification is in the discretion of the Ordinary, who will give longer time, if any impediment or hinderance appear. Item if the Point be to be proven by <hi>Oath</hi> of Party, and at calling of the Act, the Advocat for the Party who is to give his Oath, produce Testificats of his <hi>Sickness</hi> or <hi>Infirmity,</hi> or other necessary obstacle or impediment: and therefore craves a further Term, or Commission, which will be granted, if the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony be upon <hi>Conscience</hi> from known Persons; especially Ministers, and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians. Especially if that obstacle was not known to the Partie's Advocat, when <hi>Litiscontestation</hi> was made, but <hi>emergent,</hi> and new come to Knowledge. And though it be not sustained, yet if there be any probability therein, the Term will be circumduced <hi>conditionally</hi> to such a Time, that the Party holden as confest may compear and depone. And these <hi>conditional Circumductions</hi> the Lords, upon Supplication, do oftimes prorogat, as they see Cause.</p>
            <p>In posterior Diligences, there is only Warrant granted to cite such Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses as were in the former Diligence, unless there be a Warrant for it by the Lords, upon the <hi>emergency</hi> of the notice of further Witnesses, or the Death, or Removal of others before cited: and regularly no more than twenty four Witnesses can be adduced for the same Points.</p>
            <p>Witnesses will be received upon the very Day of compearance assigned for them: and they are brought judicially to the Bar, and the Parties being also called to the Bar, their Oaths are taken by the Ordinary, who may hear and discuss the Objections made against them, or may refer the Objections till the afternoon, to be received by those who receive and examine the Witnesses. Who, if any Debate arise upon any Objection, will ordain the Witnesses to attend the next Day, and in the mean time will advise with the Lords there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t. In some cases, also Witnesses are sequestrat, that neither party may have access to them, that so they may be more free, and their Testimonies without corruption.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:100573:20"/>Objections against Witnesses as all other Dilators, must be instantly verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Witnesses not being obliged to attend, till the verity of the Objection be proven. Nor are two <hi>Litiscontestations</hi> admittable, regularly, in one Cause. Therefore <hi>Reprobators</hi> have been sometimes protested for, but the effect thereof hath been very rare.</p>
            <p>Requisites of Witnesses are, That they be <hi>famous, equal,</hi> and <hi>inconcerned</hi> in the <hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Upon the same Point of Infamy, Persons known to the Lords to be debauch'd, or in no reputation, (albeit they be not so <hi>judicially</hi> declared,) will be excluded: and such as are not worthy the Kings <hi>Vnlaw.</hi> Upon which ground it is, that <hi>Beggars</hi> are excluded.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Witnesses are excluded upon their Interest in the Adducer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And where there is not <hi>penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria testium,</hi> sometimes Witnesses adduced of a further Degree, will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, as in <hi>penuria testium,</hi> Degrees regularly prohibite, will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>The Degrees of <hi>Affinity</hi> are not so clearly determined. But, unless there be <hi>penurie,</hi> the same Degree is likewise to be observed in Affinity as is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinity. But there is no <hi>affinitas affinitatis:</hi> and therefore a man will not be admitted in the Cause of his Wif`s <hi>Brother</hi> and <hi>Sister,</hi> but he may be Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the Cause of his Wif`s Sister`s <hi>Husband</hi>; because that is but <hi>affinitas affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis.</hi> Much more in Cases more remote.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Interest</hi> in the Adducer, so <hi>Prejudice</hi> or <hi>Enmity</hi> with the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may exclude Witnesses: who in that case are not presumed to be <hi>equal</hi> and <hi>impartial.</hi>

            <p>And likewise upon the Point of Interest, not only domestick <hi>Servants,</hi> but moveable <hi>Tenents,</hi> who may be removed at the arbitriment of the Adducer, having no standing Tack, nor Infeftment; are not ordinarly admitted: but Vassalls, and Tenents having a Tack are.</p>
            <p>Witnesses are also excluded upon <hi>inequality,</hi> if they have given partial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, in prejudice of the Party against whom they are adduced; or have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, (or accepted a Promise of) any benefit or good deed, for bearing testimony, other then the ordinary Expences allowed to Witnesses. And therefore albeit these be not objected agai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st the Party, the Lords use to cause Witnesses purge themselves of <hi>partial Counsel,</hi> which they explain to them, not only of their partiality by <hi>good deed,</hi> whereby they may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to have promised, and intended not to be exact in the truth of their testimony; but also if they have stirred up the Party to the Plea, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to bear Witness for him, and advised him how to mannage it.</p>

            <p>But in all Cases, there is much in the arbitriment of the Lords: wherein they ponder the <hi>Moment</hi> of the Cause, the <hi>antiquity,</hi> and <hi>capacity</hi> of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s, are admitted contrary to the ordinary Exceptions.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100573:20"/>
And albeit in civil Cases, the Lords do not admit VVomen; yet in some Cases, wherein they are necessary VVitnesses, they will be adduced even in matters of greatest Moment. As if the Question be concerning the return of Tocher, or the Enjoyment of a Joynture, and if it be alledged, That al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eit the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was dissolved within year and day, yet there was a <hi>living Child</hi> born and heard <hi>cry</hi> and weep; in this case, the Mid-wife, and other VVomen who were present at the birth of the Child, will be admitted VVitnesses, as being necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, seing men use not to be present at that time.</p>
            <p>Sometimes also the Lords will admit VVitnesses <hi>cum nota</hi>: and generally, when VVitnesses are examined <hi>ex nobili officio,</hi> all VVitnesses whatsoever are admitted, and the Lords consider how far to make use of their Testimonies, at the advising thereof.</p>
            <p>The Probation being closed, the Cause comes to be concluded. VVhich is two wayes: for either the Pursuer renounceth Probation, and refers the Cause to the Lords; or otherwise, if the Defender have adduced Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and have no more Terms current, or competent, then the Pursuer doth protest, That the Cause may be holden as Concluded, which also will be admitted.</p>
            <p>At the conclusion of the Cause, when VVrits are produced, the Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer is not obliged to dispute that the VVrits produced will prove, or not; yet it must appear, that the VVrits have contingency with the Points to be proven: for the production of any VVrits, is not sufficient, and will not stop the Circumduction of the Term; but notwithstanding thereof, if they make nothing to the Points to be proven, the Term will be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
            <p>VVhen Commissions are granted to examine VVitnesses in the Countrey, the Term will be circumduced if the Report be not produced. And if it be produced, but contain no Testimony of VVitnesses, but the Procedure of the Commissioners; there the Dispute arises, whether he who was to report the Commission, or the other Party have failed or not: for if they have failed, the Term will be circumduced. And therefore they alledge these Reasons to purge their failzies. 1. That the Commissioners, (one or more) necessary to have proceeded, kept not the Dyet, or that having kept it, they refused to examine the VVitnesses in respect of the other Parties not compearance, upon any Question arising, whether the Witnesses were receivable, yea or not: wherein the Commissioners are to follow the common Rules o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against Witnesses as aforesaid: and if any extraordinary Objections be alledged, they may mention the Objections, and receive the Witnesses; but they may not reject the Witnesses, but ought to leave it to the Lords conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, what use they will make of the Testimony. And therefore if they reject the Witnesses without the ordinary Exceptions, the Party grieved will alledge, That the Commission ought to be renewed to them, with order to receive these Witneses which they have refused; or to other Commissioners; or that the Witnesses ought to be called before the Lords. Or if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners refuse to examine the Witnesses, upon the Interrogators proposed, if the Lords find these Interrogators pertinent, they will grant a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and ordain the Witnesses to be examined thereupon. Or if any accident hath befallen the Party, who was the Adducer of the Witnesses, or other considerations occur, moving the Lords, they will either grant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission <hi>de novo,</hi> or otherwise a Term to adduce Witnesses before them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:100573:21"/>When any Party craves Commission to adduce Witnesses in the Countrey, it is upon their peril of moving the Witnesses to appear. For in that case they are not to expect Terms, and several Diligences, as if they adduced them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords: the very demanding of a Commission importing a passing from the ordinary Terms, if the same be granted.</p>
            <p>Causes being concluded in manner foresaid, there ought to be an Act ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted thereupon. After which it comes to be advised. The <hi>Saturday</hi> ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly is spent in advising concluded Causes: and either Party may protest <hi>to be heard,</hi> at the <hi>advising of the Cause,</hi> as they think fit. But whether Parties do protest or not, the Lords doth always call them, and hear them. If the Probation be by <hi>Writ,</hi> or by <hi>Oath,</hi> containing any <hi>Quality.</hi> But if the Oath be <hi>simple</hi> and plain, the Lords will advise without calling the Parties. Or if the Probation be wholly by Witnesses, the Testimonies are not published un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Parties: and therefore the Lords advise the same with closs Doors.</p>
            <p>If the Probation be by Writ they are heard, Whether the same prove or prove not, and the whole Writ, or the Clauses in question, are read in audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Parties.</p>
            <p>In like manner Objections are competent against Nullities of the Law, which are visible in the Writs adduced: as <hi>want</hi> of Witnesses, or Writer, or Witnesses not <hi>designed,</hi> or as <hi>vitiat in substantialibus.</hi> Yea not only Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections are competent, but Exceptions that may elide the Writ produced, are also competent; especially if in the Act there be a Reservation to alledge a <hi>contra producenda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if the Alledgence doth elide the Writ produced, it should be such, as could not have been known the time of the <hi>Litiscontestation.</hi> But the Alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ought to be instantly verified, except in singular Cases, in which there will be a new Probation admitted, which makes an exception from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Rule, That there cannot be two <hi>Litiscontestations</hi> in the same Cause.</p>
            <p>There are also frequent Debates upon qualified Oaths, Whether the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty adjected be competent, or not. Wherein this a general Rule, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the Alledgence referred to Oath, relates to any Writ, Fact, or Deed wherein the Alledger pitches upon what makes for him, admitting the other Points and Circumstances, when it is proper for the Deponent to express the whole tenor of the Writ, Bargain, Promise, or Fact, as well that makes against him as for him. And these are called <hi>intrinsick</hi> Qualities: because the Qualifications or Conditions are <hi>inherent</hi> in the same Fact, or Right. As if a Party be pursued on an alledged Bargain for delivery of Victual, or Ware, at the prices libelled; if he depone, It was true the Bargain was made, but with this Condition, if the Mony was not delivered against such a time, the Bargain should be void; And that it was not delivered, nor offered at that time; this is a competent Quality. In like manner, if one be pursued for a Debt, or for a Promise made, or Goods delivered; as the libel, if it be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Oath, will not be relevant, except the Subsumption bear, That the same is <hi>resting, owing,</hi> or <hi>unperformed,</hi> so the Deponent doth properly and plainly depone, both upon the truth of the Debt, Promise, or Receipt, and also that the Debt is not resting, but was payed and received, either by the other Party himself, or others by his direction, and warrand. Nor will he be obliged to produce or prove these: seing his Obligation is not proven by Writ, or Witnesses. In which last cases, the Presumption of Not-payment, and Not-performance being negative, transfers the <hi>onus probandi:</hi> and therefore Payment or Performance must be proven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:100573:21"/>But there are other Qualities <hi>extrinsick,</hi> and unproper, which will not be admitted by way of Quality, to be proven by the Deponent's own Oath: but ought to have been proponed and proven by Exception. As if a Party being pursued for a Debt, acknowledge the same, but depones<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> That the Pursuer was owing him as much: this is extrinsick, and resolves in an Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Compensation.</hi> And therefore will not be regarded in the Oath, but the Defender will be decerned, <hi>reserving his Action</hi> for that other Debt <hi>as accords.</hi> Yet if it be dubious, whether the Quality be competent or not, the Lords will sometimes find it relevant as an Exception, and assigne a Term for proving thereof, or will decern, and preserve that Alledgence <hi>contra exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutionem,</hi> by way of Suspension.</p>
            <p>At the advising of the Cause, many times new Defenses and Alledgences are proponed, which are received, if <hi>instantly verified,</hi> but not otherwise, though emergent or new come to the Proponer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But such Alledgences emergent, or new come to knowledge, may be reserved by way of Suspension, or Reduction: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the other Party gets Decreet, and may use Inhibition, or other real Execution thereupon, and get Caution before he be put to dispute these Points.</p>
            <p>VVhen the Lords proceed to advise the Cause, they either find the Points referred to probation <hi>proven,</hi> or <hi>not proven.</hi> Or otherwise they find thè same <hi>proven simpliciter,</hi> or they find the same <hi>sufficiently</hi> proven <hi>ad victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If the Lords at the advising of the Cause, find some Points not clear, they will ordain such further Probation to be adduced by either, or both Parties, as they see fit.

            <p>The Lords are not so ready to reduce or suspend their Decreets upon Points and Reasons not emergent: but it being alledged, that either the

            </p>
            <p>Neither will the Lords recall Decreets upon <hi>Certification,</hi> or <hi>Circumdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of the Term, especially Certifications in Improb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This is the ordinary <hi>Form of Process</hi> before the Lords of <hi>Council</hi> and <hi>Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> then which there can be nothing more rational, more regular; every Form being the product of long experience, from clear reason and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For the Lords are still supplying and perfiting, as they see cause: and whatsoever seems convenient at first, if it prove afterward inconvenient, is laid aside. So that what is retained, is that which hath for a long course been found rational and convenient.</p>
            <p>But besides the ordinary Form, many things are incident, in Processes, which are <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and fall not under the ordinary points of Process; at least, in the ordinary way: which therefore are offered to the Lords by <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,</hi> and proposed in the time of the Dispute <hi>verbo,</hi> not comprehending any Defense, Reply, or Duply. Such as the Sequestration of <hi>Goods</hi> in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, or the Sequestration of <hi>Mails and Duties</hi> of Lands, or naming <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> for unlifting the same <hi>medio tempore:</hi> the taking of the <hi>Oath</hi> of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or Witnesses, to remain <hi>in retentis,</hi> before the ordinary time, if they be sick, or going out of the Country, or very old: yea when persons are near the point of Death, the Lords will ordain them to be examined upon Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, although the Process be not so much as called.</p>

But if Parties neither rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Summons before the examination of the VVitnesses, nor do then protest; they are presumed to acquiesce in the hability of the VVi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But even after Sentence, Reprobators are <hi>Competent,</hi> though far less <hi>favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> (and after a considerable time ought not to be admitted;) because if they be insisted in, sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tly after Sentence, the Adducer of the VVitnesses, if any of their Testimonies should come to be rejected upon inhability, might adduce more VVitnesses for the same Point, unless by the Probation he were found accessory, to the Corruption of the VVitnesses.</p>
            <p>Reprobators cannot proceed upon pretence of the <hi>falshood</hi> of the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but upon the <hi>incapacity,</hi> or <hi>inhability</hi> of that Party to be witness in that Cause. VVhich will not be excluded, because the VVitnesses have deponed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generally, or particularly, concerning their <hi>hability</hi>; whether upon the motion of the Judge, who ordinarly purgeth all VVitnesses of <hi>partial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi> or upon the Alledgence of the Party referring any Objection to their Oath. The reason of the difference is, because the Testimony in the Cause could not prove, unless there were other VVitnesses concurring: but as to the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> there is no such concourse, every VVitness Deponing for himself. But if the ground of Reprobature be referred to the Oath of the Adducer of the VVitnesses, it will be most favourable, and sustained; except the Adducer be alledged <hi>author</hi> of, or <hi>accessory</hi> to the Corrupti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>; which could not only be <hi>criminal,</hi> but <hi>capital:</hi> and therefore he is not obliged to depone thereanent, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sentence, when the Corruption hath become effectual.</p>
            <p>The main ground of Reprobators, is the Corruption, or Prevarication of the VVitnesses. For if before the Testimony quarrelled, they have sworn incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistently therewith, it will canvel the Testimony upon Prevarication, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Infamy; but no Oath emitted thereafter, will weaken the former Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Especially <hi>post sententiam qua jus est acquisitum parti.</hi> Albeit in Re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations, recently taken, if there be Prevarication, and Inconsistency; the Lords <hi>proprio motu</hi> will reject the Testimony.</p>
            <p>Giving or promising <hi>good Deed,</hi> besides the ordinary Expenses, and promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and instructing VVitnesses how to depone, or threatning them if they do not so, or so, depone; are pregnant grounds of Corruption and Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>Civing <hi>partial Counsel</hi> by instigating the Parties to the Plea, and promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to depone for him likewise a relevant Reason of Reprobature. And likewise the <hi>Infamy</hi> of the Witnesses. as being before condemned for an atrocious Crime, or declared infamous. And likewise interest in the Cause: whereby the Witnesses may have a considerable Gain or Loss.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:100573:23"/>But there be many other Exceptions which might exclude a Witness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Examination, that will not be sustained by way of Reprobature after: in which there is a Latitude <hi>in arbitrio judicis.</hi> As if the Witness were Cousin German to the Adducer, or were not accompted a vertuous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or had given his opinion to the Party how to proceed, or been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at Consultations. Or if the Witness, before he were adduced, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ise, or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, so to depone; or instigating the Plea thereby. For after Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess are intented, though Persons express what they know in the matter, it will will not amount to <hi>proditio testimonij.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Reprobators are sustained, to be proven by Witnesses, they ought to be condescended upon, and be above all exception. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Reprobators may get run round, and leave Causes to a perpetual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty.</p>
            <p>Upon the Decreets of Session, all manner os Executorials do proceed in course, by Letters under the Signet. As for arresting the moveable Sums, or Goods to be made forthcoming for satisfying the Decreet: which cannot be <hi>Loused</hi> upon Caution, except in singular Cases. <hi>Inhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> hindering the Party decerned against, to dilapidat his Lands or Heritage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Horning,</hi> for charging him to make payment, and for denouncing him Rebel if he fail. <hi>Poinding,</hi> for distraining of his moveable Goods. <hi>Appri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi> or <hi>Adjudication</hi> of his Lands and heritable Rights in satisfaction. And <hi>Caption</hi> for <hi>incarcerating</hi> the person of the Party decerned, if being denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Horn, he have not performed. All which Executorials may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed jointly or severally, except only, that if the Creditor possess by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Apprising or Adjudication, he cannot detain the Debitor in Prison.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Imprisonment,</hi> as its last Remedy, admits of Liberation <hi>super ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sione bonorum,</hi> proceeding upon Humanity, and Mercy. For albeit many Nations do allow the selling, or using the Debitor as a Slave; yet our Incarcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is designed but to compell him to do all things, <hi>in his power,</hi> to satisfie the Debt. And therefore when he dispones all that he hath, heritable, or moveable, to his Creditors, and delivers the same and the Evidents thereof; he is set at Liberty, and is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ecure against all Creditors whom he hath cited for that purpose, as to his <hi>personal</hi> Freedom. Yet without prejudice to them, to use <hi>real</hi> Execution against any <hi>Goods</hi> that he shall thereafter acquire. And this Decreet doth no longer protect him, then he wears for his outmost Garment, the Habit appointed by the Lords for <hi>Bankrupts,</hi> in which he must come out of Prison, unless this be dispensed with upon special considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the manner how he broke, if it was without fraud or prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (as in the case of Merchants) if it were by Shipwrack, or Insolven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Debitors, or by fire, Robbery, or other accident.</p>
            <p>Against this <hi>cessio bonorum,</hi> there are only two Defenses accustomed: the one is, That the Bankrupt hath dilapidat some part of his Estate, since his Incarceration, further then his necessary Aliment.</p>
            <p>The other, if the Creditors offer to Aliment him in Prison: which can be but a dilator Defense, till they may have time to discover what latent Rights ha <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
