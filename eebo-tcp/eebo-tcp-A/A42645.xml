            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Of the
Commonwealth of England.
The Humble Remonstrance
OF
Sir BALTHAZAR GERBIER, K<hi rend="sup">t</hi>.</head>
            <p>Sheweth,<lb/>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat his fidelity and zeal to this
State and Nation, which hath
bin manifested during his thirty
yeares applications to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
concernments, hath moved
him (in regard of giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of sundry particulars) to
mention those which he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conceived both the Times and Occasions might
justly challenge at his hands, unto such Members as
are interessed in the managing of this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
affaires.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:30098:3"/>
And whereas the Parliament hath of late directed
a solemn Embassage to the States-Generall of the
<hi>Vnited-Provinces,</hi> possibly with an intent to proceed
in the like manner towards such other Kings and
States as shall deserve their Amity:</p>
            <p>Your humble Remonstrant hath long since pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
and penned several particulars wherein the
publike service is concerned, and hath kept them
in readinesse against such a time as the State might
be pleased to call for them to be considered of, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
publikely, or privately: For that some of them
are supposed to be of the nature of <hi>Arcana Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicae,</hi>
the keeping of them secret proving to be
as their life: and therefore (as he humbly conceives)
they ought to be considered of in the like manner,
and to be resolved on out of hand.</p>
            <p>Such are several of his Proposals, which in the
year 1623. were discovered by a considerable Party
unto those Persons who as then were the prime
Ministers in Authority; and the which, should they
at present be considered of, would happily not only
be judged fit by the Parliaments great wisdome to
be kept secret, but to be undertaken out of hand,
in consideration of the present conjuncture of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
when as neighbour-Nations are hammering
on Treaties, and patching up their differences:
Which being once allayed, the said parties may in
all likelihood proceed to such resolutions, and enter
on such Engagements, as that when they shall be
once put in practise, would prove too late for to be
provided against.</p>
            <p>Your humble Remonstrant hath therefore, in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30098:3"/>
conformity of his zeal and fidelity, attended to give
a clear account of all those particulars wherein this
State may be concerned, and with that reference to
the publike good as may be justly expected. The
which did lately beget a jealousie in him, on an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
which hath been given in, of the necessity
there was to call him to an Account; when as his
voluntary and free Attendance could not imply any
necessity to such an Information; For that he hath
been far more ready to open his Budget, then pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
the multiplicity of Affairs could afford a time
to view his Pack.</p>
            <p>And whereas he humbly conceives, that Inferiors
cannot too much expresse their fidelity, zeale, and
readinesse unto Superiors: So lest it should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
that by his having but one Tongue to speak,
he should want hands during the time of his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
to put himself in a readinesse to be accompta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Parliament, remitting to their great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
the sit opportunity of their taking notice of
his said Proposals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to order therein according
unto their pleasure.</p>
            <p>He therefore thought it requisite humbly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
himself in this manner on his Proposals; and to
demonstrate how that in the first place those parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
which were presented in the year 1623. unto
such persons who were then in Authority, are of
such a nature, as that in case they be made use of at
present, they may stand this Commonwealth in as
great a stead, as the golden Mines do unto the King
of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, That there are certain Establishments
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30098:4"/>
extant in other Countries, which if they were pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
here in <hi>England</hi> under the Parliaments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
would be very beneficial to the people, and
produce a vast stock of ready monies for the States
use: Some of the said Establishments being prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to be erected by such persons, as demand
nought save this Commonwealths protection and
encouragement in those said Establishments; which
will produce a present vast stock of ready monies,
together with a constant considerable yearly Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to boot for this Commonwealths use; and the
gaining of the Peoples love.</p>
            <p>Finally, That there is (as he humbly conceives)
<hi>periculum in mora,</hi> in the not present heeding of a
claime to be laid on a Debt of Seven millions of
pounds, which are due unto this State by those of
<hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi> Wherefore your humble
Remonstrant (to make good his said zeal, as well
by his pen, as by his heart and tongue) presents the
state thereof unto your Honours in the ensuing lines
<hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Annals of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> mention that.
it hapned on the 5. day of <hi>March,</hi> how that the great
Commander of <hi>Castile,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi>
being deceased, a Councel of State was appointed
to govern in those Provinces: and the said Councel
was authorized by Letters Patents from King <hi>Philip</hi>
the second under his great Seale, in date, <hi>March</hi> 24.
1576. The said King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> (by his Letters of
<hi>April</hi> 1576. invited Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to continue a
correspondencie with those of his said Councel of
State in the said Provinces: And by that Councel
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30098:4"/>
of States appointment so authorized, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and recommended, The Duke of <hi>Arscot</hi> was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
and declared Generall for the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> in
those Provinces. The said Dukes Commission being
under that Kings Broad-Seal, dated the 3. of <hi>October</hi>
1576.</p>
            <p>The said States as then standing in need of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
stock of moneys, sent to such Neighbours
as they conceived to be in a capacity of furnishing
them: and as they sent to the Prince Elector of <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
to the Duke <hi>Casimir,</hi> and others for a Loan of
moneys, they likewise sent unto Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Ambassadours were the Baron <hi>Sweueghen</hi>
and the Marquesse of <hi>Haure;</hi> and the Queen was
pleased to appoint the Lord <hi>Burley,</hi> and the Earle of
<hi>Sussex</hi> and others, to Treat with them concerning
the Loan of money, for which they offered their
Bonds, and to second them by the Bonds of the
States of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> together with those
of the Towns of <hi>Bruxels, Antwerpe, Gendt, Bridges,
Newport,</hi> and <hi>Dunkirck.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those Ambassadours and States obliging their
Persons, and the Magistrates of the respective
Towns themselves, and their Inhabitants for ever;
untill full satisfaction should be made, not onely of
the said Loans capital summe, but also of its Interest
at Six and a quart. <hi>per Cent. per Annum.</hi> Whereupon,
the Queen was pleased to grant them a Loan on the
above mentioned Conditions.</p>
            <p>And whereas the respective original Bonds, of
which your humble Remonstrant hath given notice
to the Councel of State, are in safe Custody, so they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30098:5"/>
doe manifest the reality of the said Debt.</p>
            <p>Which together with its Interest from the year
1578. untill this present time doth amount unto se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Millions of pounds, lawfull moneys of <hi>England,</hi>
since neither the Use money nor its Capital is
yet paid.</p>
            <p>The Loan of the moneys was allowed of by King
<hi>Philip</hi> the Second, as it appears by the eight Article
of those States Treatie with their King at <hi>Marche</hi>
in <hi>Famines,</hi> on the 27 of <hi>February</hi> 1577. and the
which was ratified and confirmed, as appears by the
nineteenth Article of the Surrender of <hi>Arthois</hi> in
<hi>Haynault.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The said King also returned his thanks unto
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for that she had assisted his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>Moreover those States specified the said Loan in
their Accounts, which were by them exhibited to
their King, on the second of <hi>September</hi> 1584.</p>
            <p>And the King of <hi>Spain</hi> past those Accounts in lue
of their Taxations and ordinary Contributions; so
that the Debt thereby became those States, and those
respective Towns and members particular proper
Debt.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is to be demanded of them, and
not at all from any Governour in chief of those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
much lesse from from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>Which the late Arch-Duchesse <hi>Isabella</hi> declared
unto them, when late Mr. <hi>Trumbal</hi> Agent, both in
King <hi>James</hi> and in the late Kings time, had laid a
Claim to the said Debt, and had prosecuted the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30098:5"/>
Debtors, when the said Arch-Duchesse warned and
advised them also to satisfie on the said particular,
for that she would not bear them out in the same.</p>
            <p>So that both by Mr. <hi>Trumbal</hi> his pursuite, and the
Arch-Duchesse her declaration unto those Debtors,
there would have ensued a good satisfaction on that
particular, had not the said Agent been recalled by
reason of the following rupture between <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The said Agent <hi>Trumbal</hi> had likewise contracted
with one <hi>Tymon</hi> an Advocate, to prosecute the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the said Debt; Conditionally that the said
<hi>Tymon</hi> should have a certain part of whatsoever he
should recover touching the said Debt; and this in
consideration of the said Advocates pains, disburs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and such Presents as he should be obliged
to give unto such Persons as might be in credit with
those States, and with the Magistrates of the respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Towns.</p>
            <p>The said Claim was again renewed in the year
1640. and was seconded by the late Kings own Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to the Infant Cardinal, and to the Chancellor of
<hi>Brabant,</hi> and by the said Kings Commissions,
which he caused as then to be dispatched on that
particular; the Copies whereof are here inserted, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>This Commission, as likewise the Credentials are
translated <hi>verbatim</hi> out of the French tongue, in
which the Originals are written; having been
thought necessary to be penned in that language,
because that they might have been made use of in
case of necessity. For that it was agreed on between
King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh and the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi>
that their publique Conferences should be in the
French tongue, in which their publique Ministers
were likewise to speak.</p>
            <p>And the said Commissions were also dispatcht at
that time, for that a Person in authority in those
Provinces had made a proposition to procure satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
from those States for the said Debt, they (as
it seems) being sensible of its Interest excessive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease;
apprehending likewise, that as then the
English Nation might have transported the said
Debt either to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> or to the <hi>French,</hi> then
in open war against them; And therefore shewed
so great a willingnesse to come to a composition
thereon.</p>
            <p>Which being duly represented to the late King,
the said Commission was immediately dispatched;
which was the rather effected, to save it from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription,
as the said Debt requires to be claimed at
every change of Government.</p>
            <p>But the late King being at that time highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30098:8"/>
against your humble Remonstrant, for that
he had (in obedience to the Peers commands, then
assembled in Parliament) declared the names of such
as betrayed this State, especially the L. <hi>Cottington;</hi>
He therefore caused Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> then Secretary of
State, to call in again the said Commission concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that particular (which Commission was under
the great Seal) and likewise redemanded the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique
Copies of the Original Bonds and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which had been translated here by a publike
Notary, and unto which the City of <hi>London's</hi> Seale

            <p>Insomuch that the said chief Commission, and
the other authentique Copies being redemanded,
and your humble Remonstrants return to <hi>Bruxels</hi>
being impedited, the prosecution of the said Debt
hath ever since layen dormant.</p>
            <p>That the said Commission, with the Credentials,

            <p>Hereby this particular Case is stated; The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
which have been formerly held thereon
are manifested, and the cause of its having remained
dormant ever since.</p>
            <p>The which in case it be renewed before the Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
may justly plead a Prescription, and before they
shall have any other cause to pretend any other eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
Then the said Debitors may be so wise as to
desire and seek to come to a Composition on the
Total, before it amounteth to a further Increase:
when as moreover they shall be induced to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
that a Transportation of the said Debt might
be made unto the <hi>French</hi> their Enemies.</p>
            <p>So likewise on the other side, may the <hi>French</hi> be
called upon for the satisfying of the said Debt, since
they possesse the Town of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> which in its

            <p>Finally, Your humble Remonstrant conceiveth,
That as this States remaining silent as touching the
said Claim, cannot stand this Commonwealth in

stead in any regard whatsoever, nor cause that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to esteem it any more for the same: But to
the contrary, if after the claiming of the said Debt,
this Commonwealth shall think it fit to grant those
States a favourable Composition thereon, a Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
or an Acquittance of the Interest upon Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est;
Then those People must needs acknowledge
the perpetuall Obligation which they will thereby
owe for so considerable a Favour.</p>
