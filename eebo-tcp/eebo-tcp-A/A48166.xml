            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> LETTER, <hi>to a Friend, concerning the preſent State of the Army in</hi> Ireland, <hi>which bating the Relation of</hi> Charlemont, <hi>(which is ſince taken) contains ſeveral things which will not be altogether unacceptable to you.</hi>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU having a great mind to underſtand the ſtate of things in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I'll give you an Extract of a Letter which I have received from a Perſon of Quality and Credit in the Army. There was a Detatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of the Regiment of Col. <hi>Cutts</hi> conſiſting of 60 Men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by a Captain, a Lieutenant, &amp;c. who were ordered to keep a Poſt which hindred any of the Garriſon of <hi>Charlemont</hi> to go out: On which about Five Hundred of the Garriſon Sallied out to Attack them; ours were re-inforced by Twenty French, making but Eighty Men in all, commanded by the Marquis <hi>de Rada,</hi> a Captain in that Regiment. They behaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſo much Bravery and Conduct, that they forced the Enemy back, killing and wounding ſeveral: On our ſide only a French Officer was killed, and two Soldiers, and a Drummer and Soldier taken Priſoner, which are ſince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for two others taken by us. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> a Volunteer diſtinguiſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a great deal of Bravery; and the new-raiſed <hi>Cambridgeſhire</hi>-men did incomparably well. Duke <hi>Schomberg</hi> had advice the Night before laſt, that upon King <hi>James</hi>'s ordering Three French Regiments into <hi>Dublin,</hi> he commanded Col.<hi>Dorrington</hi> with his Royal Regiment of Guards, and Mr.<hi>Fitz James</hi> with his Regiment of Foot to march out: Upon which Col. <hi>Dorrington</hi> asked him, If he deſigned to make the French his Guards. The King anſwered, He did. To which <hi>Dorrington</hi> replied, That if his Majeſty reſolved on that, then he and 16 other Officers deſir'd to reſign their Commiſſions; for they owned that they had rather ſubmit to the Engliſh, then be Slaves to the French. Upon this K. <hi>James</hi> called a Council, and joyned a Regiment of French and a Regiment of Engliſh which hath diſſatisfied both. I write this word for word as the Duke told it us. The Army here is in a very good condition; the Regiments that were ſo ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd are now recruited and full; they are well cloathed, and ſeem deſirous to meet the Enemy. Our Hoſpitals and Magazins are very carefully provided for; and any Colonel that hath a mind to Beef, Meal, Bacon, Peaſe, Bread, Cheeſe, &amp;c. is furniſhed upon account from ſeveral Store-houſes that are ſettled in ſeveral Ports of the Country, and in this I write but the naked Truth.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>King</hi> an Officer of King <hi>James</hi>'s Army is this day come in to Duke <hi>Schomberg</hi>; he hath ſerved there in the Horſe all this while, and hath given the Duke a particular Account of the State of the Army: They put their chief Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in their Horſe and Dragoons, but their Foot is very inconſiderable in every thing but their Number. Their whole Army, if their Regiments were all full, conſiſts of about 50000 Men, but few of them are compleat. When the Army comes to joyn, I ſhall be able to give you, if acceptable, a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, larger, and quicker Account of things than I can now, becauſe my Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are upon the Frontiers, and I have not occaſion of writing regularly. I am going to my Quarters which are towards <hi>Charlemont.</hi>
