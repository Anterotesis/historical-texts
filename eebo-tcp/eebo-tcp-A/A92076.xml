            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

As the Intereſt of Religion was our ſolicitude when theſe Thoughts were conceived and delivered: So now we are filled with Joy, while we behold the Religious regard, that the High, and Honourable Court of Parliament have ſhewed to the <hi>Mountain of the Lords Houſe, above other Mountains,</hi> (which they truly are, and ought to be concerned about) in the great ſtep towards the eſtabliſhing thereof, that they made by their Vote <hi>28th.</hi> Inſtant, Settling the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Presbyterian Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> and their proceeding to conſider the other things needful, for promoting <hi>Religion</hi> in this Church, and Nation.

               </gap>hat can be, and that which moſt men are leaſt concerned about. But as it alwayes ought to be otherwayes, ſo the Lord here promiſeth, that there ſhall be a time when it ſhall be more regarded. This promiſe was made to the Church before the Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> that it might be a ſupport to the Faithful in that dark Hour: And it is repeated <hi>Micha.</hi> 4. and 1. As that which was needful, and yet hard to be beleived. We are here to conſider, <hi>Firſt,</hi> the certainty of the event, <hi>It ſhall come to paſs,</hi> Or be; Whatever unlikelyhood, or letts, may be in the way. God hath ſaid it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the time of it, <hi>the laſt dayes,</hi> the dayes of the Goſpel: Or when God hath exerciſed his People with Tryal, he will at laſt put an end to their trouble, and bring this about for their comfort. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſubject ſpoken of, <hi>the Mountain of the Lords Houſe.</hi> By this, no doubt, is meant the Church, or the Religious intereſt of Men: <hi>Mount Zion</hi> (that is one of the two tops of it, called <hi>Mount</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:133373:5"/>
               <hi>Moriah,</hi> where the Temple was built) was a name ordinariely given to the Church of God: And from the Dialect of the old Teſtament, it is transferred to the new Teſtament. Wherefor, by the <hi>Mountain of the Houſe of the Lord,</hi> is meant the Church. It is ſhe, It is the Religion owned and profeſſed in her, and Gods ordinances whereby ſhe is diſtinguiſhed from other Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that is here promiſed to be exalted ſo high. The Church or the concernments of Religion may well be called a Mountain, both from her Eminency, and alſo from her ſtability. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> two things are ſaid of this Mountain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her preference to other things, and her increaſe are both aſſerted For the former it is to be conſidered, <hi>Firſt,</hi> abſolutely, that ſhe ſhall be Eſtabliſhed <gap reason="foreign">

God will put a Luſtre on Her. And men (when the Lord poureth out the Spirit on them that ſeemeth to be promiſed in the Text) will contribute what they can to promote her Spiritual Glory. <hi>2ly.</hi> Comparatively. The Church muſt be fixed and exalted <hi>above the Mountains and Hills,</hi> That is, preferred to all the other Intereſts of Men,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:133373:5"/>
however great they he in the Eyes of the World, the Lord will make Her more Glorious then any other Society or falſe Church: And men will (when this promiſe is fullfiled) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Her Intereſt to all that can be dear to them, or great in their Eyes. The other thing that is ſaid of the Church is, that all <hi>Nations ſhall flow to Her,</hi> when God ſhall thus exalt Her, and when men ſhall thus ſhew their zeal for Her, many will come to Her, joyn with Her, ſubmit to Her, it will be a Terrour to Enemies and an allurement to Strangers.</p>
            <p>Diverſe practical and important Truths might be obſerved from this Text: But I pitch upon this one, as of great uſe and neceſſity to be conſidered by this Audience at this time, <hi>to wit, That God will, and Men ought to prefer the Intereſt of the Church and Religion, to all other Concernments whatſoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us (for our more diſtinct procedure) conſider <hi>Firſt,</hi> What this Religious Intereſt is, and what are the great things to which it muſt be preferred. <hi>Secondly,</hi> How God will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> How men ſhould do it. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Why it ſhould be ſo.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> we muſt conſider that Chriſt is a King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. v. 6. And though his Kingdom be not of this World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Jo.</hi> 18. 36. Yet it is in this World: And his Royal Power is exerciſed viſibly among Men. <hi>Math</hi> 28. 19, 20, with the 18. And that as diſtinguiſhed from (though no way oppoſite to, and far leſs inconſiſtent with) the Kingdoms of men. If it be managed according to his Laws, it doth not tend to depreſs, but to exalt mens greatneſs; neither can it otherwayes curb their Exceſſes, then by holding forth his Law, which ſetteth bounds to all the Actions of Men with reſpect to the moral good or evil that may be in them: Now this glorious King muſt have a people (for here it muſt not be queſtioned, That the people are for the King, and not he for them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 1. 7, 21) There muſt be a Seed to ſerve him, <hi>Pſal. 22. 30. Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. That the Doctrine that he hath taught be owned and believed. That
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:133373:6"/>
he be Worſhiped in the right Management of his Ordinances: That his Laws be declared, ſubmitted to, and obeyed: That the government and order of his Houſe be obſerved, as he hath held it forth and injoyned it: And all this for the promoting of Holineſs, reſtraining of Sin, and the Salvation of Men. This, I ſay, is that Mountain; that great Concernment, that the Lord doth, and Men ſhould prefer before all things elſe. There are indeed other Mountains; things that are great and Momentous in the Eyes of Men, which may and ought, in their own place, to have a due regard. But muſt no wayes vie with the <hi>Mountain of the Lords Houſe,</hi> with the great things that concern the Church and Religion. The greatneſs and Prerogatives of Kings; the Eſtabliſhment of Earthly Throns; and the Liberties and Priviledges of People, the ſecurity and ſafety of the preſent Government and Conſtitution of a Nation, the advancement of Trade and enriching of a Nation: Theſe are great things, and by all good means muſt be ſecured, ſo far as Men can do it: Yet none of theſe ſeparately, nor all of them in Conjunction, are of ſo much value, as that they ſhould be preferred to this Mountain that the text ſpeaketh of: But it muſt be ſet above them all. It is true there is ſuch a Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt this Mountain and ſome of theſe Mountains, that the one cannot be ſafe, if the other be Ruined: And therefore, even for its ſafety they are to be Regarded (of which more after) But when this Spirit, that is here promiſed, is poured out on Men, theſe will be minded but in the ſecond place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly</hi> I am to ſhew how the Lord doth, and will preferre the Mountaine of his Houſe, the intereſt of Religion, to all other Mountains, or intereſts, that are great in the Eſteem of Men. This will appeare if we conſider, <hi>Firſt,</hi> what is poſitively declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scripture of his ſpecial reſpeſt to his Church, and her Religious concernments, above all the other intereſts, not only of the reſt of the world, but even of his own People. A notable place to this purpoſe is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. Where Gods eſteem of his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:133373:6"/>
Church is purpoſely inſiſted on: It is <hi>His Foundation:</hi> It is indeed the ground of all his Diſpenſations to men; with reſpect to it is all the conduct of providence. And then, <hi>He loveth it better then all the dwellings of</hi> Jacob, neither the Kings palace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor the State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buildings of the Nobles, none of the Civil, Publick, or Private, concernments of his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eople, did beare ſo much bulk in his Eye; yea ſuch <hi>Glorious things are ſpoken,</hi> (by the Lord in his Word) of the Church, as of no other thing on Earth. And the Lord rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth the honour of men not by their noble Blood, but by their relation to his Church, and concern in Religion <hi>verſe 4th Egypt</hi> (under the name of <hi>Rahab</hi>) and <hi>Babylon,</hi> were then the moſt flouriſhing Kingdoms in the World: But it was a greater honour to be of poor <hi>Iſrael</hi> then of any of theſe: A well reformed Church is a greater Glory with God, then a flouriſhing Kingdom: Yea the warlike <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> the Rich trading <hi>Tyre,</hi> the ancient <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> were nothing to him, in compariſon of poor <hi>Judea:</hi> Becauſe Gods ordinances were there: ye ſhall pleaſe God better and do him better ſervice, if ye make poor <hi>Scotland</hi> a well reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church, than if ye could make her richer, more potent, and ſplendid than any of her Neighbour Nations It is Religion that maketh People truely Honourable, for it is that which maketh them precious in Gods ſight <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 43: 4. Nothing doth ſo truely, and in the eſteem of God, and good Men, ſo exalt a People, as the Truth, the Purity, and the Power of Religion flouriſhing among them.</p>

We may, with good warrand, ſay, that the whole conduct of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is managed with an Eye to the Church and Religion: which cannot be ſaid of any other intereſt in the World Hence Chriſt is not only head of his Church to rule her; but head over <hi>all things for</hi> her behove <hi>Eph.</hi> 1: 22, He made the World that he might have a People to ſerve him on Earth, and to praiſe him for ever in Heaven. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 45. 18, 19.

            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> The ſame is clear by what he hath promiſed to do for his People: as in the Text: And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 54. 1 &amp;c. <hi>Dan:</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 44. <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 18.

            </p>
            <p>I proceed to the third thing above mentioned, to ſhew how men (even all men in their ſeveral Capacities) ſhould imitate God in this; and contribute their endeavours to advance Religion above all things that are great or precious in the Eyes of the World. And leſt any ſhould miſtake the tendency of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; I ſhall ſhew what is not to be expected of them who have true zeal for Religion, which poſſibly ſome may look on as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of its intereſt. As <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is not advancing of Church-Men unto Worldly dignities or power: We plead not for a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, to be <hi>Cardinals</hi> or <hi>Prelats:</hi> Neither do we think it any advancement to the Church, that her Miniſters have a ſhare in the Civil Government. As Chriſts Kingdom is never of this World, ſo its dignity and advancement lyeth in nothing that is Worldly: Nothing but a Worldly Spirit, and a falſe <hi>Idea</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, could make Men think this an advancement to the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For it is truely a depreſſion of Her; and putteth that as a diadem upon Her head, which the Scripture places under Her feet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12 1. Her Glory is the Sun, Chriſt; and the twelve Stars; the Light of Apoſtolick Doctrine; Not the Moon, this inferior and changeable World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:133373:8"/>Neither lyeth the Churches advancement in Spiritual, or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Domination, to be Lords over Gods Heritage, or Maſters of Peoples Faith. 2. Cor. 1. 24, <hi>Not for that we have dominion over your Faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by Faith ye ſtand.</hi> 1.

But to declare theſe which Chriſt hath made, and to impoſe <hi>them</hi> (not what we think ſit) by his Authority, and to Cenſure ſuch as will not obey his Laws; not as we will, but as he hath appointed. We ſet up no <hi>Imperium in Imperio;</hi> but a <hi>Ministerium<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> It is true Chriſts ſervants are Cloathed with his Authority (and men ſhould advance the Church by allowing them the free exerciſe of it) to declare the Laws of Chriſt, and to require obedience to them: And all men from the higheſt to the loweſt ought to bring their Necks under this his yoke Yet this is far from Claſhing with, or diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Magiſtrat<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

Neither doe we plead to be advanced to an exemption from the Laws and Authority of the Magiſtrate as ſome others do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> We plead not to be advanced to worldly Pomp and Riches: Let not the Church be ſo depreſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that her Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters be under anxious Penury; that hindereth minding their Work or contemptible Meanneſs; that the world be not tempted to vilify them and their work too: And we have enough.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> Neither is the Church preferred, nor Religion promoted, by ſetting up a Pompous, Gawdy, Theatrical kind of Worſhip: by pretending to adorn it by modes and Religious Rites that Chriſt hath not inſtituted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Her greateſt Beauty and viſible Luſtre is Goſpel ſimplicity. So far as we go from Apoſtolick Purity, ſo far we depreſs Religion, and deform the Beautiful face of Chriſts comely Spouſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:133373:8"/>Let us then conſider poſitively, how men ſhould ſet the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lords Houſe upon the top of the Mountains:</hi> What way they muſt prefer Religion to other Concernments. <hi>Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> They muſt Labour to ſecure that Intereſt: Not to leave it at uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If they be Careful (as wiſe men will) to make ſure Work about their worldly Affairs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether publick or private; much more ſhould that Care be uſed in this Caſe. And for this end, they ſhould be careful to build upon a good Foundation: Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Doctrine, as it holdeth forth Chriſt in all his Offices; and particularly, his Kingly Office, is the only Foundation for Church work, <hi>Eph 2 20, 21, 22. And are built upon the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Christ himſelf being the chief corner-ſtone. In whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord. In whom you alſo are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.</hi> Mens Devices and mens Politicks, lay no ſure ground for the Church-Care is alſo to be taken, that nothing may be laid on this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, but what is ſuteable to it: Let all things be done <hi>for the Houſe of the God of Heaven, according to his will.</hi> Even a Heathen knew this to be Duty. <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 23 See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 9 10, 11. Likewiſe, men ſhould be ſure, That they build upon this Foundation, and not act by Gueſs, in this matter: And they ſhould build ſtrongly; that neither open Enemies may batter, nor falſe Friends undermine this Building. Let Laws about Chriſts matters be well digeſted, and wiſely conſidered, and fixed with all Care.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> Let Chriſts Church enjoy all the Priviledges that he has granted her. If men with hold any one of them, they do not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the <hi>Mountain of the houſe of the Lord</hi> as they ſhould. Sound Doctrine, Pure Ordinances, a Godly Miniſtry, a Government drawn from Chriſts Inſtitution, and Apoſtolick practice, and that tendeh to advance Holineſs: That it be managed by its Friends, and not by them that would Supplant it; that they may Aſſemble as oft as is needful for this end: That Church Officers
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:133373:9"/>
be <hi>lookt out,</hi> and choſen by the People of God, and not <hi>Impoſed</hi> on them by Mens will, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3 That the Fountains out of which a godly Seed for the Church may Iſſue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be kept pure: That Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline may be duely Exerciſed: And whatever lets to Religion, and ſnares to the Serious Godly, men have framed into Laws, may be removed. This would conduce much to the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if any of theſe be neglected, She is not ſet on the top of the Mountains, but ſomewhat elſe preferred to Her. Half <hi>Reformations</hi> are often condemned, when <hi>the high places</hi> were not removed, though many things were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably Reformed there is alwayes a mark ſet on that Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation as Sinfully defective.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> The promoting of Holineſs is one chief way of advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion, and making the Church Glorious. Holineſs is Her Beauty and Cogniſance, <hi>Pſal 93. 5 Ezek.</hi> 43. 12. Let Laws be made and executed, for reſtraining the horrid Immoralities that have defaced the Church; and for encouraging true Piety.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> Let no Intereſt be preferred to, or come in competition with, the concernment of Religion. As it can never Claſh with any of the true Intereſts of Men: So where it is ſo apprehended, that men think, that either it, or they muſt ſuffer inconveniency; let it alwayes have the preference, as being of moſt value, and on account that due regard to it, is the way to engage the Lord to take care of mens other Intereſts, even when they ſeem to be in hazard: See for this <hi>Exod. 34 24. For I will caſt out the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before Thee, and enlarge thy Borders; neither ſhall any man deſire thy Land, when thou ſhalt go up to appear before the Lord thy God, thrice in the year.</hi> This ſhould be minded mainly, with the greateſt zeal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the greateſt tenderneſs, leſt any wrong ſtep be made about it. An error about other matters ſhould be look'd on as of leſs moment, and leſs dangerous conſequence. If any thing muſt run a venture, let it not be Chriſts Intereſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>5thly.</hi> It belongeth to this preference<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Religion ſhould have, that it be poſtponed to no other concernment. As we are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:133373:9"/>
to <hi>ſeek the Kingdom of God firſt,</hi> with reſpect to our own Souls, <hi>Matth</hi> 6. 33. So muſt we uſe the ſame Conduct with reſpect to the publick and more general advancement of that Kingdom: This is to be underſtood, when the time of conſidering this Affair, may import either its eſteem, its ſafety, or any other advantage to it. Then all things ſhould yeild to it, even in that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. Let it not be thought (when we thus plead) that they who do moſt concern themſelves in the Church, are either Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient under neceſſary delayes, or would preſcribe to them whom the Lord hath entruſted as the Nurſing Fathers of the Church: They can with confidence Truſt this to the Wiſdom of ſuch Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Patriors: But we are confident that zeal for the Church, the conſideration of her preſent Confuſions, and regard to the Souls of Men, will ſuggeſt this to them. If <hi>David</hi> was allowed to plead with God (as <hi>Pſal</hi> 70. 1 5.) That the <hi>Lord would make haſt to deliver and help him,</hi> and that he <hi>would make no tarrying:</hi> I hope we ſhall not be blamed if we ſo plead with men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>6thly.</hi> They that are truly zealous for advancing the Intereſt of the Church and Religion, will alſo be careful that the State be well ſettled. There is a connection betwixt theſe two, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Soul and Body: The illneſs of the one affecteth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If the Government be not ſupported, if that Eſtabliſhment of it that is Friendly to Religion be not ſecured, if it be in the hands of either open Enemies, or falſe Friends to Truth, and to the right wayes of God, the Church cannot be ſafe It is true the Lord can ſupport her (and hath done it) amidſt her moſt Bloody Foes: But a Godly Magiſtracy is the ordinary means for that end. They are Nurſing Fathers, Chriſt hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the care of his Spouſe (as to externals) to them: And this Truſt they cannot well perform<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they let the Houſe go to ruine over Her head. Wherefore if men will eſtabliſh the <hi>Mountain of the Houſe of God above other Mountains,</hi> They will alſo be duely careful of the Intereſt of the Nation, and that for the Churches fake, for the ſake of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> here, and elſewhere, as well as for theit own ſakes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:133373:10"/>The fourth thing propoſed to be Diſcourſed, is to give the Reaſons why the Intereſt of Religion ſhould be ſo minded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that with preference to all other Intereſts. I may confidently affirm, that few Reaſons will be needful to perſwade them of this, and to incline them to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who in leed underſtand what Religion is, and who are truely concerned in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But that I may give you a few hints to this purpoſe. Conſider <hi>Firſt,</hi> The advancement of Religion is that whereby God is more honoured then by any other way. The Riches, Power, Splendor of his People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or of a Nation, or of great Ones, doth not ſo much honour him, as this doth: Neither doth their meaneſs and contempt, and low<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> condition in the World, ſo diſhonour him, as abounding Sin, Idolatry, Superſtition, Church Confuſion, or other ſinful courſes do, ſee <hi>Pſal 48 1, 2, 3. Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praiſed in the City of our God, in the Mountain of his Holineſs. Beautiful for Situation, the joy of the whole earth is Mount</hi> Zion, <hi>on the ſides of the North, the City of the great King: God is known in her palaces for a refuge.</hi> Chriſt is <hi>King of Kings</hi> and therefore his intereſt is to be preferred to that of all the great men on Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2ly.</hi> The Salvation of men is nearly concerned in this, the advancement of other intereſts may be conducive to their riches, power and Worldly greatneſs: But this is the mean to ſave their Souls. The ſoundneſs of Doctrine, the purity and livelineſs of Ordinances, yea the order of the Church of God, is of great uſe for this end: Even that tendeth to preſerve the truth and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God: To curb vice, and to engage men in the wayes of God: And therefore they who deſire to be holy or to ſee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs promoted among men, cannot but think it of high concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Church be well ſetled. If then ye have any regard to your own immortal Souls, If ye value the Souls of People more then your Worldly concernments, make it your care to advance Religion rather then any other intereſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:133373:10"/>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> True Religion, and the flouriſhing of it among a people is the greateſt Glory of a Nation The pooreſt &amp; moſt contemptible People may, by this means, have their reputation advanced in the ſight of God, and in the eſteem of all good men: Yea often in the Eyes of them that are but moral and intelligent, though Enemies, Deut 4 6. 7, 8 v. 6 <hi>Keep therefore and do them for this is your Wiſdom, and your underſtanding in the ſight of the Nations, which ſhall hear all theſe statuts, and ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſurely this Nation is a wiſe and underſtanding People</hi> v. 7. <hi>For what Nation is there ſo great, who hath God ſo nigh unto them as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for?</hi> v 8. <hi>And what Nation is there ſo great, that hath ſtatutes and Judgements ſo righteous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as all this Law, which I ſet before you this Day.</hi> And not only ſo; but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is the way to bring down National bleſſings, as the neglect of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion bringeth National Curſes and Ruine. As may be obſerved in the whole current of the Writings of the Prophets, and in the Hiſtory of the Judges and Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi> If ye will ſet Chriſt on high in this poor Church, he will ſet the Church and Nation on high. <hi>Scotland</hi> hath in former times been renowned and eſteemed among the Churches of the Reformation, upon this account. It may be an honour in after ages to your Poſterity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſuch a man was active and Faithful in that happy Parliament, that ſettled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Religion and the Church, when it had been almoſt ruined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly</hi> Yea this is the way to ſecure us that we need not fear our Enemies, or them that are unfriends to our way: But rather ſhall be feared by them. Religion well ſettled and flouriſhing in a Nation, will render it more formidable, then ſtrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Armies or Navies could do. Gods preſence among a People (and that is beſt obtained by the advancement of Religion amongſt them) uſeth to ſtrike terror into the minds of their Enemies. 1 Sam. 4: 7: 8. <hi>And the Philiſtines were afraid, for they ſaid God is come unto the Camp: And they ſaid, wo unto us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for their hath not been ſuch a thing heretofore.

            </p>
            <p>And now to conclude with a few words for applying of what hath been ſaid: Ye ſee what the Lord giveth us hope that he will do for his Church: Ye ſee what he calleth you in your preſent Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in the high truſt that God and the Nation have repoſed in you, to do for Religion. That ye ſhould be careful to ſet <hi>this Mountain on the top of the Mountains, and advance it above the Hills.</hi> Wherefore let me beſeech you, and obteſt you in the Lord, that ye would bring home all that hath been ſaid, to your own practice, in theſe three things. Firſt beware of being defective in this, either by luke warmneſs, neglect and indifferency, or by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring any thing elſe to the well being of Religion: Beware of venturing it for a Worldly intereſt, either publick, or private, and ſelfiſh: For your humour, to maintain a S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Reſolve to be Faithful, and that ye will thus lay out your ſelves for the Lord: And be careful to lay hold on the happy occaſion that the Lord hath put in your hands to do him ſervice, in promoting of true Religion. Conſider what peace it will yield you in the day of trouble, and at Death, that ye have ſincerely appeared for God and Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And what a terror the contrary will bring What a Bleſſing it may entail on you and your Families: And what a Curſe will be on all them who are Enemies or falſe Friends to Religion.
