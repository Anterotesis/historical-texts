            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Present Distracted and Broken Nation of ENGLAND, and to all her Inhabitants.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>A Presentation and Declaration from the Seed of God, and from the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> with their Sense and Knowledge published, concerning the present Divisions and Confusions come to passe in the Land, with the Causes thereof laid down and discovered, and also good Councel and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice held forth, how Peace and Unity may be restored, and how the present tribulations may be removed.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>H poor distressed Nation, and full of troubles; how art thou broken and divided? how hath divisions &amp; distractions compassed thee about, and entred into thy bowells? and how are thy inhabitants, and thy people divided even into hatred one against another? and how are they filled as with mischiefe one toward another? even as it were, thirsting for the blood one of another. Oh! how are thy Rulers and thy Subjects, thy great men and thy poor, confounded amongst themselves? and how is the wisedom of thy wise men turned into folly; and their union into present contention? and how do they seeke the overthrow one of another; and how do they lye in waite to be avenged one against another? and how are the hearts of many filled with envy, contention, and revenge; and love, peace, and unitie, are farre away, meeknesse, patience, and long suffering, which ought to be among thy people, seemes to stand afar off; And oh Nation, this is the day of thy trouble, and the begining of thy sorrows.</p>
            <p>And for as much as it hath pleased the Lord God Almighty, to bring and suffer things thus to be brought to passe, as if he would make our Nation a heape, and suffer destruction upon it, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing suffered the Rulers and great men to overturne and break down one another, and to rend and tear one another from off the Throne; pulling down others, and setting up themselves, even
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52889:3"/>
thorough their ambition and vaine glory, and for corrupted ends to themselves; wherby this our Nation is brought into present confusion, and many are begotten thorough these things into fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, heart burnings, and malitiousnesse; as if men were ready to devoure each one his neighbour, and their Brother; about Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Rule; being greatly divided and distracted in this matter; some crying up one way of Religion, and Church, and Civil Government; and some crying up another way, being each one sort of people seeking themselves, and the prosperitie of their own interests, and to have their own desires accomplished, but few seeking the Lord, and to advance him in truth, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</p>
            <p>And because of this, there is no establishment in the Earth, but strife, and contention, and heart burnings in the bowells of the Nation, and great want of true love, true unitie, and true peace, and all the contrary doth abound among the people; because of which the Nation is subject to present misery, even to bloodshed and murthers, and liable also to greater judgments which may also come upon it, because of these things; all which we have deeply considered, with mourning, and with breakings of heart, on the behalfe of the Nation, the Land of our Nativitie; we have seen, we have seen, the cause of thy distractions, to be the Sins of thy Rulers and People, and we have seen the effect of them, to be dolefull and miserable unto thee, except the hand of the Lord turne it backward.</p>
            <p>And oh, how do we mourn and lament, to behold the out go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of men, and the present condition of the People and Rulers in this the day of their trouble; alass they do not behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves towards the Lord that his judgments may be turned away, they do not seeke him in truth and righteousnesse, they do not turne unto him with all their hearts, neither do they tremble at his Word: But they the rather reject his Counsell, and despiseth his visitation, and they seek themselves, and exalt their own horne, and loves the honour of this world, and their hearts are hardned, and the great men seemes to be utterly insencible of what the Lord is a doing, but seekes great things for themselves, and each one rejoycing in anothers fall, and glorying in their advantages one over another; one sort being first down, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort comes up, boasting themselves over the fall of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and not knowing, that their time also is but very short. And
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52889:3"/>
thus is our poor Nation tossed to and fro thorough the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men; who even makes a prey upon the poor peoples Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Treasure, for their own corrupted ends, and thy Rulers hath not had respect unto the counsell of the Lord, but seemes to refuse the way of peace, and even adds fewell to the fire of Gods wrath, by heaping up one trausgression upon another, and they receive not the instructions of the Almighty. Behold, oh Nation, great trouble is upon thee, and the men that should rule thee, and which have pretended to govern thee, they do not walk in the way of thy peace, neither do they bring healing to thee. These things we have considered, and thus we lament over thee, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thy present State. Oh Nation, how are thou like an ungirded vessell, that is ready to fall one piece from another? and how art thou like a body without a head, and all thy joynts out of order? and what confusion art thou fallen into, which is thy present State, and art even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s a widdow without a husband, and art left comfortlesse unto this day, and ready to devoure thy self thorough the envy that lodgeth in thy owne bowells; though thou hast had Kings over thee, and chosen the Parliaments, and, set up Protectors; and Committees and Councels have bin crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in thee, to have bin as a defence upon thee, and to have borne the Scepter of thy Government; but alass these have all left thee, and thou art now as alone, and left in trouble, and confusion, and none of all these that have sitten on thy Throne, have brought salvation unto thee, but thou art left comfortlesse even as a wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow unto this day, and the Staffe of thy hand hath peirced thee, and thy strength and considence hath betrayed thee, and them whom thou hast chosen have wrought no deliverance at all in thee, even the men that thou thoughest should have healed thee, they have made thy wound more incurable, and they in whom thou hast reposed trust, they have been deceiptfull and treacherous in thee, for many have sought themselves, and who should be the greatest, and they have trifled away many precious houres in vaine contentions about Government, what it should be, and who should Govern, while as no good thing hath been effected by them, but in the meane time of their delaies, and while they have been making themselves rich with the Nations Treasure, and loved this worlds perishing honour, and vaine titles, the Nation hath star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for want of mercy and just judgment, and the cause of its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity hath bin forgotten, and mercy, and truth, and the freedome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52889:4"/>
of the people neglected, and the cause of the faeherlesse, widdow, and stranger, and the cause of the afflicted people, have they not respected; Oh Nation, the men that have sitten on thy Throne, they have left thee groaning yet under great oppressions, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the spirit of Tyranny yet un-cast out, and thy people are yet unhealed, but the breach hath been made wider, even by that Spirit which hath possessed thy Kings, thy Parliaments, thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors, thy Councils, thy Committees, who hath proved unto thee Phisitians of no valew, but have bin the encreasers of thy greefe, and even because of their iniquities, and the Sin of their ambition and oppression, hath the Lord dealt thus with them, and suffered them to dash one another in pieces, and through judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto themselves and thee, oh Nation, are they at present cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from thee, and thou art left alone, and without a deliverer in the Earth, full of troubles and distractions; oh that thou wouldest now look unto the Lord, and seek him in righteousnesse, that he may heale thee, for there is none of all them that do pretend to Rule thee, that do rightly proceed in the way of thy deliverance, they do not apply healing balm unto thy wound, they rather add unto the cause of thy sorow, then removes it from thee, their hearts are not aright before the Lord, and how then shouldst thee prosper in their doings.</p>
            <p>All these things have we veiwed, and pittied the condition of our Nation, and thus we do declare that the very cause of these things that are come to passe in thee, is in that, oh Nation, thou hast sinned, thou hast sinned; and the cry of thy iniquities is come up before the Lord, even the sinns of thy Rulers, and thy People, is the cause of Gods displeasure against thee, and he is provoked, through their transgressions, in thee is found the blood of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, in thee is found the murther of Souls, in thee is found trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery against God, and hipocrisie, and dissimulation with God and men, in thee is found pride, and oppression, whoredome, and drunkennesse, stealing, and murther, in thee is found the very bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of iniquitie, and the full measure of transgression, even the transgression of Gods whole Law, deceit is found in the unsound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart, and unconstancy in all good things, multitude of hypocriticall fastings, prayers, and services, in thee is found, even destroying sins of all sorts doth abound, and thou hast provoked the Lord God by thy abominations: Thy Rulers have bin op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors, thy Teachers deceivers of Soules, and thy People are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52889:4"/>
froward, and perverse, against the Lord, in thee is found the men that judge for rewards, and the Priests that preach for hire, and the Prophets that divine for money, thy fins are like <hi>Israells</hi> of old, for number, and greatnesse, and thou hast lost Gods favour, and gain'd his fury, by thy own doings, and thou art the very cause of this misery, and hast brought it upon thy self, and because thou art departed from the living God by thy transgressions, therfore hath he confounded thee, and turned thy wisdome into folly, and he is departed from thee, and out of thy counsells; and men are left to the counsells of their own hearts, and as it were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to destroy one another, Ruler against Ruler, and Neighbour and Friend full of strife one against another, and this is hapned unto thee as a judgment for thy iniquities, who hast also neglected a glorious day of visitation, thy Rulers and inhabitants have bin warned, and the cry of repentance hath bin sounded towards them all, by a despised people, but warning hath not bin regarded, but the Word of the Lord rejected by thy Rulers and People, and loe what wisdome is there in them, not so much wisdome from God as can preserve them, but it may be just with the Lord to suffer them to drink the blood one of another, even because they have finned against God, and rejected his counsell, therfore is this come to passe in the Nation: for hadst thou, oh Nation, walked in the light of the Lord, it had bin better with thee, had every one obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the light in his own conscience, and had every one sought the Lord, and not himself, had thy Rulers Ruled for God, and had thy people bin Ruled of God, then this day had not bin a day of trouble, but it had bin a day of joy, and sorrow and anguish had bin removed farr from thee, and blessings had filled thy habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>And now wheras many wise men have bin advising and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting the peace of this our Nation, and they have given in their counsell for the removing these troubles, yet peace and unitie seemes to be farr away, and though they have sought peace for this nation, yet they have not walked in the perfect way therof, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, truth, and simplicitie, have bin wanting, which God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will blesse, and by flatteries, and deceipts, and the pollicy, and wisdome of this world, have they thought to make up thy breach, but it cannot be, for in the way of that proceeding will not the Lord be found in a needfull time; and his presence hath bin want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their counsells, and therefore the fruit of peace is not yet
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52889:5"/>
grown up; this we have seen, and therfore thus we do declare, O Nation, the inward cause of thy distractions must be removed, even thy iniquities must be forsaken, and thy transgressions repented of, thou must forsake thy former waies and doings that are not right, thou must leave off thy hypocrisies and flatteries with God and men; thou must repent thee of thy profannesse, and of thy profession also, thy sin and thy righteousnesse must thou put away, which are both abominations unto God, thou must cease to do evill, and learn to do well, and thou must be uncovered of thy Sheeps cloathing, thy large profession of Religion, and the multitude of thy prayers, and Sermons, and the number of thy Oblations, and Offerings, these things have not bin pleasant unto the Lord from thee, but because hrreof is he the rather provoked against thee, and thou must be stripped of thy filthy garments, and sett as in the day that thou wast borne, before thou canst be cloathed with divine righteousnes, and, O Nation, thou must be changed, not in name only, but in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; thou must be converted, that the wrath of the Lord may be turned back from thee; every inhabitant in thee must becom a figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter against the evil in his own heart, and the plague therof must be sought out and removed; the sin must be forsaken, that judgment may cease, and every one must cease to provoke the Lord, and no longer vex his Spirit within them, and every one must love the light of Christ in his own conscience, and become a follower of it, that will lead him out of all sin, and every man must put off his transgressions and forsake himself, and lay down the enmity, and cast it out of his heart, that he hath against Persons, and he must warr against the Enemies of his own Soule, and the Enemies of his own house must be slayne, even his own lusts, and even the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil affections of his own heart must he become an Enemie unto, and every man must deny the false Teachers and Deceivers, and must come to be taught of the Lord, every one must turne to him, and come into his Covenant, and hear his Word, and obey his Voice, and become humble and meek, and must tremble at the word of the Lord, and must become upright and innocent.</p>
            <p>And, O Nation, if it were thus with thee, then shouldest thou be a happy people if thou do thes things, then shal all thy breaches be healed, and thy sorrows be turned into joy, and the Lord shal cease to smite thee, &amp; his anger shal be turned clean away: This is our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel unto thee, remove thy iniquities by repentance, be converted to the Lord, and he shall heale thee, and his love shall be shed abroad;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52889:5"/>
peace, plenty, and satisfaction, unity, and concord, shall be unto all thy inhabitants, and the Lord himself shall be thy King, thy Judge, and thy Law-giver: he will judg thee with equity, and not with oppression, he will teach thee in the perfect way, and thou shalt not err, he will defend thee from all thine Enemies, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants shall not have power over thee; Oh Nation if thou do these things, even turn to the Lord with all thy heart, that he may walk in thee, and dwell in thee, then should thy light break out of obscurity, and the dew of mercies should fall upon thee, and it should be unto thee as a Morneing without cloudes, and thou should'st be refreshed after all thy sorrowes, the Nation should be happy, and the People blessed, and the Government of peace, and truth should be established, never to be confounded any more.</p>
            <p>And thus thy iniquities being removed, the plague should cease, and the cause of destruction being taken away, no fruit thereof should appeare, wherfore let men cease to hatch mischiefe one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another, and to seek vengeance one of another; and let them seek with all speed, and sincerity, to get victory over their own sins, and that vengeance may be taken upon their own transgressions; and this is our counsell for the healing of our Nations breach, and for the turning away of the anger of the Lord. But and if, O Nation thou continue in thy perversnesse, and in thy transgressions which the Lord hates, and if thou wilt not turn to him that smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thee, and love his Rod that corrects thee, but wilt alwaies greive the Spirit of the Lord, and will be obstinate, and stout-hearted against the Lord, and his reproofes, and if thou wilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in thy accustomed sins, then shall the reward therof be upon thee, even breach upon breach, and one judgment upon another; and mercy shall be with-holden from thee, and the dew shall not fall upon thee, but thou shalt be as a barren heath, and thou shalt be given up to consume thy self, in mischiefe, and in thy heart burnings one towards another, if thou wilt set up Rulers of thy own proud and ambitious men, and will not choose the Lord to Rule over thee, but reject him, and his people, then shall thy breach never be healed by the men whom thou choosest, but through them shall thy breach be more desperate, and thy wound made more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, and if thou wilt set up Teachers that teach for filthy lucre, and Prophets that divine for money, and Priests that preach for hire, and will not receive the Covenant of the Lord, and him to be thy Teacher, by his Spirit; then shalt thou Err in thy wayes,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52889:6"/>
and stumble, and fall, and never know perfect peace with God, nor one with another, but as thou lovest oppression and deceit, and walkest in transgression, so shall it be unto thee, and thou must eat the fruit of thy own doings, misery upon miseries shall be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and thou shalt not see the face of the Almighty to refresh thee; wherfore O Nation, consider before the night come upon thee, when no way will be found by thee to be delivered, for in the midst of thy confusions; God is a working, he hath a work to bring forth, which shall be a work of great mercy, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, or of sorrow, and of great judgment, even to the whole Land.</p>
            <p>And as for us, we hereby declare unto thee, we are not thy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, we seek not thy hurt, nor do we desire vengeance upon our Enemies, we seek not thy destruction, but we desire thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that thou mayest be healed; we have not the spirit of mischiefe, and rebellion in our hearts towards thee, neither are we for one party, or another, nor do we side with one sort, and rebell against another, neither do we joyne our selves to this sort, or the other, nor do we warr against any by carnall weapons, neither shall we ever provoke the Nation against us, otherwise then by our righteous and holy walking, &amp; we do declare that we are not for men, nor names, nor shall we joyne with this, or that sort of men, but as they act righteousnesse alone, nor any thing which yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, can we fully embrace or rejoyce in; for they are all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in their waies, and that cursed spirit of self seeking, seemes to be the rule of, and to leaven their principall actions, and we ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet chuse to suffer by all, as for a long time we have don al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; then to lose our integrity, and innocency, by joyning to any, in their unjust waies, for we reject all places of corrupted honour, and we are yet kept free. It is true, we are a people gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord into one Spirit, and though a people littie in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and very low in reputation, and greatly reproched, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a suffering people by all sorts of men, yet we are a people loved of the Lord, and his presence is among us, and his dread filleth our hearts, and though we are accounted as a cast-out people, yet are we dreadfull unto the wicked, and must be their fear, for we have chosen the Sonn of God to be our King, and he hath chosen us to be his people; and he might command thousands, and ten thousands of his Saints at this day, to fight in his cause, he might lead them forth, and bring them in, and give them victory over all

their Enemies, and turne his hand upon all their persecutors, but yet his Kingdome is not of this World, neither is his warrfare with carnall weapons, neither is his victory by the murthering, and killing of mens persons, neither hath he chosen us for that end, neither can we yet beleeve that he will make use of us in that way, though it be his only right to rule in Nations, and our heireship to possesse the uttermost parts of the Earth, but for the present we are given up to beare, and suffer all things for his names sake, and our present glory, and renowne therin stands, till the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time of our deliverance, without the Arme of flesh, or any mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of an hoast of men; this we declare, and O Nation, though we have born thy reproches these many yeares, and have passed under the Rod of thy wicked Rulers, and people, and we have bin affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted through their hard-heartednesse, though we never have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked thee, otherwise then by our well doing; and though persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, imprisonments, whippings, banishments, and all hard things have bin our portion from thee, yet this hath bin for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse sake, and not for any evill doing, and we have borne all these things in much patience, and we are not now provoked against thee, to seek thy hurt, or to work evill in thee, though thou hast smitten us, yet would we have thee to be healed, and though thou hast sought to destroy us, yet would we have thee to repent and be saved, and we are at this day thy mourners, and are afflicted for thee in our hearts, even because thou hast provoked the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, though we do rejoyce in the judgments which smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thee; yet we mourn for thee who hath deserved such wo full stripes; and also because thou refusest the way of peace, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them that reprove thee even thy Enemies, and hardnest thy heart against Gods instructions; and counteth his free borne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thy bond-slaves; who hath not any larg portion, not great places of honour in this Nation, nor ny thing to glory in from thee, but sufferings, afflictions, and tribulations; where is the place in this Nation, that we have not bin reproched? in what Streete have not we bin reviled; and in what Prison have not we bin unjustly imprisoned? and among what sort of people have not we bin hated? and what oue of thy Judges and Rulers can cleare themselves before the Lord, from the guilt of our unjust sufferings; O Nation, our portion in thee, for these many years, hath bin thy cruell reproches; our greatest place of honour in thee, hath bin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy cruell oppressions, and these things, and the guilt thereof

            <p>And though there hath bin in this Nation divers and sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturnings of late dayes, and some have bin turned out, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers brought into place, each one sort of them crying against the evil of another, and promising to accomplish such and such good things in the Nation; yet alass, what is there effected unto this day? what freedom and true liberty to subjects more then was many years ago? what oppressions taken off from the people? what establishment in Government? Alas, not any of-these things are accomplished, neither do we see a right thing propounded, and rightly prosecuted, by any party yet appearing; but the cause hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yet appears, carried on by any among them, which can be said of it, this is of the Lord, and is perfectly right, and the Lord will prosper it, for most of the men that have yet appeared on the Throne, they have rejected the Word of the Lord and his Councel; and what wisdom is there in them, only the policy, and subtiltie, and wisdom of this world, wherein they build, but the Lord throws down, even before it be finished; and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult therein, and the Lord dasheth to peeces; they set up, but he pulls down, because they want his spirit and wisdom, and his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie amongst them, and they are as the Potsheards of the earth, that the iron Rod must break in peeces; and this we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, the men (yet) seems not to appear in all these Parties, which are worthie to handle the Lords Scepter, and to be crowned with the honour of Authoritie in his Government; but even this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the other party seems to be un worthie to rule for the Lord, for they appear to be choaked with the honour of this world, and corrupted thereby, and uncapable of receiving that anointing that men must have, that shall truly rule for God; and though many in our days that have ruled over us, have promised great things to the Nation, yet we see all hitherto have wanted power to perform, and have not bin blessed with the Presence of the Lord, so as this Nation hath bin healed and redeemed by them,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52889:7"/>
and we are utterly out of all hopes of this party, or the other party, of this man, or that man, to bring salvation unto this Nation, from all its bonds and oppressions, for we know, whatsoever men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse to do, yet they cannot performe any good thing, nor Rule for God in our Nation, till that themselves be reformed, and ruled by him, and have the Spirit of God poured upon them for such a work, and this we declare, till that a man, or men, be ruled of the Lord, they can never rightly Rule for him, nor bring deliverance and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to an oppressed Nation, though men may, and have promised much, yet their fruit is but little; and thou O Nation, hast long bin deceived by such men, who have flattered thee with the multitude of faire words, and promised thee deliverance; and hereby might'st thou learn wisdom, O <hi>England,</hi> never more to rest under the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of such men, make no more a mountaine to cover thy self, rest not under the shaddow of dead Trees, that wants the vertue of God, but now look at the living God, and wait for that King of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and peace, whose right alone it is to Rule, for he alone can bring salvation to thee, he alone can heale thy breaches, even Jesus Christ, whose coming is at the doore, and in the mean time O Nation, while he is absent, thou art dry, and barren, and empty, thou art tossed, and shaken, and thou art tossed, and perplexed, and cannot be rightly comforted; for men shall not be a rest unto thee, but one after another shall they be overturned, for it is the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and under his Government shall people finde perfect rest, and freedom from all oppression, for what is a King? and what is a Parliament? what is a Protector, and what is a Councell? or any other sort of men, while the presence of the Lord is not with them, and while his Spirit and Authority is wanting to them, what can any of these bring forth, none of all these whatsoever, if the Lord be not cheefe in them, and amongst them, and his counsell their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guide, shall be any otherwise unto this Nation, then as a broken Reed to leane upon, and no more then a shaddow which shall not save the people from the heat, nor from the storme; this we know, and this we declare, in the Name of the Lord; and we are not for Names, nor for Men, nor for Titles of Government, nor are we for this party, nor against the other, because of its name, and presence, but we are for Justice, and Mercy, and Truth, and Peace, and true freedom, that these may be exalted in our Nation; and that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, righteousnesse, meeknesse, temperance, peace, and unity, with God, and one with another; that these things may abound, and be

borught forth abundantly, such a Government are wee seeking, and waiting for, wherein truth, and righteousnesse, mercy, and justice, unity and love, and all the fruites of holynesse may abound, and all the contrary be removed, cast out, and limmitted; and we are not for such and such Names, and Titles of Government, that promises faire, and performes nothing; but if a Council, if a Parliament, if any one Man, or a number of men whatsoever, that shall have the Spirit of the Lord poured upon him, or them, and shall be annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Lord for such an use, and end, to Govern this Nation, under such only shall the Nation be happy, and enjoy rest, from such men fitted of the Lord, and called by him, and under such a Government, of truth, and righteousnesse, shalt thou O Nation, enjoy rest from all thy Travells, and under such a Government, shall the righteous rejoyces and the whole Land sing for joy of heart, when Tyranny, and oppression shall be cleane removed, strife, and contention, and self seeking, utterly abandoned, and when peace, and truth, flowes forth as a streame, and the Lord alone rules in thy Rulers, and he the principall amongst them, and under such men, and such a Government only and not under any other, shalt thou O Nation, be happy, and thy people a free people.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, O Nation! when wilt thou begin to look to the Lord; when wilt thou begin to set up him, and not man, when wilt thou minde his Power and Presence in and through men, more then any men themselves; when shall it once be, O ye peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Nation, that you will seek after him, to be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and chief power among you: Oh let your eyes be turned to the Lord alone, that he may deliver you, and bring salvation and freedom, and look no more at men, but only as they are in him, and guided by his Spirit; and only expect good from men, as men are guided by the Lord; and then shall you not ever any more be deceived, as long you have bin, with Kings, with Parliaments, with Councels, with Armies, nor any others; for in these have you trusted, and not in the Lord; from these have you expected great things without him; whenas alass, what shall men accomplish, or what can they bring forth, while they reject the Counsel of the Lord, and his Word, as hitherto they have done, and therefore hath he broke them and confounded them, yea, and he will break them and crush them under his Rod, even till they learn his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and know him the alone Power, and give honour to him that doth whatsoever he will, and he will overthrow yet once

and againe, even till he come, whose right it is to Rule, and he is at work in this his day, and because of iniquities doth he visit with tribulation, and through great tribulation, and overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Men, and Powers, will he advance his own Kingdome, and Government, and the end of all these things shall bring forth his glory, and men that will not honour him by dealing righteously in their day upon Earth, they must honour him in their destruction, at their latter end, and let not men glory one over another, while some are put down, and others set up, but let them all know, they have but each sort their houre, and their end will come even as others, for an everlasting Kingdome, and Government will God set up, that must rule over all, and this is the hope of a poor despised people, though for present hated of all, and sought to be destroyed by all, yet our soules are anchored and stay'd, even in the sure promises of our God, in this the day of the Nations trouble, and though we are very poor, and rejected of all, and have nothing to glory in amongst any party or sort of people, but even in our reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and sufferings, that we sustain from all, yet have we perfect rest in God, and satisfactions over all these distractions, we know him in whom we have beleived, and we trust in the shaddow of his wing, and we are not of a doubting heart, concerning what can come, or whomsoever doth Rule, for this we know, though all seeks after our blood, yet he can deliver us if he will, we know him that can do all things, and if he save none can destroy, if he blesse none can curse; him we know, and in him we rest, and we give our power in all things to him, and not unto mortall man, whose breath is in his nostrills, who must perish as the dung, we cannot be afraid of their horror, nor can we be drawn by their love, but we trust in his Name, and under his defence shall we be saved, we give our power to him, to be defended and preserved by him alone, and we are well contented with our sufferings, and murmurs not, our sufferings are our present Crown; but yet woe unto that Authority which mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to suffer, and woe unto the men upon whom God shall charg the guilt of our oppressions, and woe unto that Spirit that is found acting against Gods annointed, behold, ye Mountaines of the Earth, behold! ye Rulers, and ye People, the Lord hath blessed his people, and every tongue that riseth up in witnesse against them shall be condemned, and every weapon that is formed against them shall be broken; this is our hope in this gloomy day, and the hope of a Kingdome of righteousnesse, and peace which must be set up, is our refreshment in this day of trouble, and let not our Enemies glory
