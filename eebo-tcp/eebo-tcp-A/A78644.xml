            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>His Maieſtie hath given me expreſſe command to give you this His Anſwer to your Petition.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat He ſees plainly that this Petition of yours hath been framed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having heard the Anſwer His Majeſtie gave to His Parliament, upon their Petition to Him for deſiſting from His Iourney into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for He cannot thinke that that Countrey (from whence He hath received formerly ſo good expreſsions of their loyall Intentions, by two former Petitions preſented long ſince to Him and the Parliament) would have been ſo much miſtaken, as to have made this Petition, after they had ſeen and well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered His Majeſties ſaid Anſwer. And His Majeſtie obſerves very well, that this Petition is not like others, which by an untimely Zeal, have deſired Him to return to His Parliament; You onely deſiring Him there to reſide, where with more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and ſecurity He may conſult with His great Councell, then by going into <hi>Ireland:</hi> His Majeſtie being confident, That your well weighing of His Anſwers concerning that ſubject, hath been the cauſe that you have not imitated ſome few other Countreys in that particular; And that you have well conſidered the Rebellious Affront offered to Him at <hi>Hull,</hi> by a hoſtile oppoſition of His entrance; and therefore beleeves that the ſame Reaſon which made you, at this time expreſſe your tender care of His Perſon, and the former good expreſsions you made of your Loyalty and right-ſet Affections to the good of the whole Kingdom, may ſooner induce you to Petition the Parliament to apply themſelves to a right underſtanding of His Majeſties wayes and intentions, and to do Him Iuſtice for that Affront, then make you to preferre any ſuch ill-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Petition. And that you may be the better informed of His Majeſties proceedings in thoſe particulars; He recommends to your view and conſideration, His Anſwers to the Declaration preſented to Him at <hi>New-market,</hi> to the Petition preſented to Him at <hi>York</hi> the 26 of March laſt, concerning His journey into <hi>Ireland,</hi> His two Meſſages and Declaration concerning <hi>Hull;</hi> all which, when it ſhall be fully repreſented to the reſt of your County, He doubts not but that you will reſt very well ſatisfied of His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Reſolution for the maintaining of, and governing you by the Law of the Land, His unmoveable Reſolutions for the maintenance and defence of the true Proteſtant Profeſsion, and the ſuppreſsion and chaſtiſing of the barbarous <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, As for your apprehenſions of danger of being left naked, and not put into a Poſture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, His Majeſtie aſſures you, That He will take care that it ſhall be done in the true old legall way which hath been uſed in this Kingdom, without bringing in ſtrangers to govern you, or admitting new and exorbitant Powers, derogating both from His Majeſties undoubted Legall Authority, and the Liberty of the Subject, which, as He hath conſtantly denied, ſo He expects, and no wayes doubts, but that you will give O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to that, and that onely, which ſhall proceed from His Majeſty in a Legall way.</p>
