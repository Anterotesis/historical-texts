         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

we deceiue our selues, &amp; the truth
is not in vs. If we say wee haue
not sinned, we make God a lier, and his
worde is not in vs. For proofe whereof,
there are two witnesses against vs. First
the testimony of our owne consciences,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.</note> w<hi rend="sup">c</hi>
euen by the light of nature accuseth vs,
both of leauing vndon many good things
we ought to haue done: and of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
many euill things, in deede, worde,
and thought. Secondly, the Lorde God
himselfe, who is greater than our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
whose wrath from heauen is<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18.</note>
manifest against al the vngodlinesse, and
vnrighteousnesse of men, as well in that
generall curse,<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 17.</note> which is come vppon all
<pb facs="tcp:13310:3"/>
creatures: as by particular iudgements
executed against sinne, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the world. But especially, he hath
most manifestly penned our inditement
in his worde: where first we are charged
with the sinne and fall of Adam,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. 16. 18.</note> as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
thereof vnto condemnation. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that wee are borne in sinne,<note place="margin">Psal. 51. 5.</note> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
in iniquitie, and therefore by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the children of Gods wrath:<note place="margin">Ephesi. 2. 3.</note> being
such,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7. 8.</note> as whose natural disposition is eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
against God, and whose cursed spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
lusteth after enuie.<note place="margin">Iam. 4. 5.</note> Thirdly, that this
corruption of our nature, hath bene most
plentifull,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 19.</note> in bringing foorth all maner
fruites of disobedience,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> causing vs to
transgresse all-the commandementes of
God,<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 20.</note> as shal most plainly appeare, if we
examine our selues, and our liues, by the
seuerall precepts of his lawe, which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs, both what dueties we owe vnto
his Maiestie for his worshippe, and also
what vnto our brethren for their profite:
so that wee may conclude with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
that all mouthes are stopped, and
that all men are come vnder the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 19.</note>
of God. We must so meditate v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:13310:3"/>
these things, as we may also be affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and touched with them. Which we
shall the rather performe, if vnto the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
confession that wee are sinners,
we shal in the presence of Gods maiestie
consider, first the filthinesse and vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of our sinnes, by comparing them
with that holinesse, righteousnesse, and
innocencie, which is described vnto vs in
the Lawe. Then the greatnesse of our
offences as committed against the most
glorious excellencie of the Maiestie of
God. Further, the multitude of our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
which are mo in number than
the heares of our head,<note place="margin">Psal. 40. 12</note> and as a mightie
water ouerflowing vs vnto destruction.
Also y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t deserued by our sinnes,
and set downe in the worde of God. First
the curse of God, entring and remaining
vpon all his creatures,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 20.</note> subduing them
vnder vanitie for our sakes. Secondly,
all the aduersities and afflictions of this
life, with the diseases of our bodies, and
griefes of our mindes. Also death it selfe
which is the dissolution of the soule and
the bodie. Last of all,<note place="margin">Leuit. 27. 26.</note> the curse of God
pronounced in his lawe, vnto euerlasting
<pb facs="tcp:13310:4"/>
damnation both of bodie and soule, with
Satan and his Angels in hell fire, the
flame whereof being kindled from the
breath of the wrath of the Lord shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<note place="margin">Esai. 30. 33.</note>
be quenched. The miserie of him that
is in such a case, must needs be exceeding
great, &amp; offereth him iust occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> feare
and trembling,<note place="margin">Matth. 3. 7.</note> to inquire what maye be

to beget vs againe vnto himselfe,<note place="margin">Iac. 1. 18.</note>
that we might be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first fruites of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:

God, which woorde abideth for euer: and
the same is it, saith S. Peter, which is
preached. This is that moste excellent

of discipline vnto his seruantes. The
one priuate, the other publique, vnto the
first appertaineth all the exercises of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and godlines commended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs either in precept or example of the
holy scriptures. As our daily consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with the worde and lawes of God,
which to be vnto vs, as they were vnto
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:13310:20"/>
Dauid the men of our counsell the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
examining of our waies,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 56. 60.</note> &amp; turning
our feete vnto the Lordes testimonyes,
our carefull and diligent hasting,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 11.</note> and not
delaying to keepe his commaundements
The grieuing of our selues with our sins
past,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 1.</note> the feare of sinne present, which is
readie to intrapp vs, the wise &amp; circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
preuenting of sinne to come, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
of the flesh, and bring it in subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
after the maner of the Apostle w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9. 27.</note>
taken vpon our corruption for the
mortifying of the same, by w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>drawing the
baites, prouocations, and occasions of
euill, sobrietie and the pure and chast
vse of all the good blessings of God: ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenence,
euen from lawful pleasures and
profites, when they are either offensiue
vnto others, or hurtfull vnto our selues,
as otherwise, so by bringing vs vnder
the bondage &amp; seruitud of earthly things,
which all of them are ordained vnto cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 12.</note>
Fasting, which the Scripture
calleth the afflicting of the soule,<note place="margin">Psal. 39. 2.</note> ioyned
with continuall and earnest prayer vnto
God.<note place="margin">Iob. 31. 1.</note> Making couenant with our mouths,
that they shall not speake euil, and with
our eyes, that they shall not beholde va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
<pb facs="tcp:13310:21"/>
imitating the vertues and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the faithfull, vsing holie company
and conference with them. Hating
detesting and abhorring the wayes of
the wicked, shunning and eschewing
all consulting and conuersation with
them. Not ceasing our conflict against
sinne,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 4.</note> euen vntill blood, but casting of the
olde man,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 13.</note> and mortifying the woorkes of
the flesh by the spirit,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5. 8. and 11. 9.</note> to put on the newe
man with the woorkes and armour of
light, to serue the Lord according to his
woorde.</p>
            <p>They which through want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
or weakenes of the minde, are not
sufficient vnto the well gouerning and
brideiing of them selues, must as the
Lord hath commanded be instructed, and
strengthened by others: that either by
mercifull admonition and exhortation,
they may bee recouered from sinne: or
else may be saued by terrors and threats
of the iudgements of God, beeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
as it were by violence, taken out of
the fire of destruction. Unto this apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth
that notable exhortation of the
Apostle:<note place="margin">Iud. 22.</note> Let vs obserue and marke one
another (not vnto enuy or occasion of sin)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13310:21"/>
but to stirre vp our selues mutually,<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 24.</note> and
euen to whet one an other, vnto the duties
of charitie, and to all good workes.</p>
            <p>The other kinde of discipline is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
consisting of three partes. First of
the preaching of the lawe, which is as a
two edged sworde in the hande of Gods
ministers, to offer vp his people an holie
and blameles sacrifice vnto his maiestie,
not onely opening our eyes, that we may
see and knowe,<note place="margin">Psal. 90.</note> what is that good perfect
and acceptable will of the Lorde, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
through the working of the holy Ghost
conuerting our soules and fashioning
them after the image &amp; similitude of him
that made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Secondly, admonitions,
exhortations and counsels ministred by
such persons, as the Lord hath appointed
for the ouersight of their brethren. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of conuenting of the offendours before
the Churche in open congregation to bee
iudicially admonished, or according vnto
the qualitie and degree of their offence,
forbidden the Supper of the Lord, or cut
of from the Churche, vntill by remorse
of sinne with smart and shame of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
laide vpon them for the same, they
shal with certaine testimonies of true and
<pb facs="tcp:13310:22"/>
vnfeigned repentance, humbly desire to
be restored vnto their former estate, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
the people of God.</p>
            <p>The weakenes of conscience must of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
times be holpen by ciuil punishment
publikely or priuately, to be executed by
magistrates, parentes, maisters, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
whom the Lorde God hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
and armed with the swoorde of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and rodde of correction, not for the
profite onely of suche as offende, but also
for the example &amp; terrour of others, that
at least by awe of punishment, they may
feare to doe euill. For as indulgence and
impunitie nourisheth &amp; increaseth wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
(as Salomon saith) and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men:<note place="margin">Eccle. 8. 11.</note> so godly seuerity of punishment
chaseth away sin, and lessoneth the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of offendours. In punishing it must
be remembred, that it be not dumme and
silent, but ioyned with doctrin, admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
&amp; exhortation, that the force thereof
may work the more in the hart of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.
It may not be the reuenge of our
priuate griefe, but of the dishonour of the
name of God, &amp; of the breach of his holy
commaundementes. It must be ioyned
with calling vpon the name of the Lord,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13310:22"/>
that as it is his good ordinance, so it may
be both giuen and receiued according to
his wil, and blessed by his spirit, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
of those, that haue done amisse,
and forwarnings of others.<note place="margin">Ios. 7. 19.</note> Finally all
meanes are to be vsed, that the conscience
of the offender may be touched with the
horror of his sinne and feare of Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice:
that we may cleere our selues of all
corruption,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 11.</note> by directing the punishment
not against the person, but against the
sinne: beeing greeued, that we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to flye to that extreme remedy,<note place="margin">Iosu. 7. 25.</note> and
yet to doe it, with á godly courage and
zeale, as caryed with most iust hatred and
indignation against sinne,</p>
            <p>Unto the abating of the rage of our
corrupt and degenerate nature,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 16.</note> the Lord
yeeldeth vs no small helpe by afflictions
and aduersities, which therefore are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
chastisementes and corrections, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are thereby reformed: as the
Prophet saith: before I was corrected,
I went astray, but now I haue kept thy
commaundements. In so much as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth,
that it was good for him, that hee
had beene afflicted, and acknowledgeth,
that of very trueth the Lorde had chaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:13310:23"/>
him: meaning thereby, that as the
Lord hath couenaunted with his people
all good things, so is it also a parte of his
couenaunt,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 6.</note> to punish and correct his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as he knoweth to be expedient for
them:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 31.</note> the reason whereof is rendred by
the Apostle, For if wee iudged our
selues, we should not be punished: but
when we are punished, we are nurtured
of the Lorde, that we might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
with the world.</p>
            <p>The ende of all is, that the workes of
Satan in the corruption of our nature,
with the fruites of the same, might vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be abolished, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the image of
God, not blemished onely, but euen can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
and defaced by the fall of Adam,
might be renued and repaired in vs. The
first happeneth vnto vs in the dissolution
of this earthly tabernacle, from which
time we sinne no more, as appeareth by
that vehement and lamentable exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Saint Paule: Miserable man that
I am,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note> would God I were deliuered from
this bodie of death. The second, though
begon &amp; increased in this life, shal not be
fully accomplished, vntill our Sauiour
Christ returne from heauen,<note place="margin">Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> 1. 10.</note> be made glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13310:23"/>
in his Saints. For albeit we are
now the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. 3. 2.</note> it hath not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
what we shall bee, but our life is
hid with Christ in God, and we knowe,
that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ, which is our life, shal be
made manifest, we also shal be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
with him in glorie.<note place="margin">Colos. 3. 3. 4.</note> Then shall we
be clothed with that glorious tabernacle,
not made with handes, eternall in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
then shall mortalitie be deuoured of
immortalitie:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 1. 4.</note> then shall Christ, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie
is crowned with glorie and honor,<note place="margin">Heb. 2. 9.</note>
returne our redemer from heauen, and
chaunge our vile bodies,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 20. 21.</note> that they maye
be made like vnto his glorious bodie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
vnto that power, whereby he is
able to subdue all thinges vnto him selfe.
Then shall it be accomplished, which is
written,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 54.</note> death is swallowed vp in vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,
O death, where is thy sting? O
graue where is thy victorie? For the
stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of death is sinne, and the strength
of sinne is the lawe. But thankes be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, who hath giuen vs victorie by
Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore let vs
be strong and immoueable in the trueth,
abounding alwayes in the worke of the
Lord, seeing we know, that our labour is
<pb facs="tcp:13310:24"/>
not in vaine in the Lorde: But the day of
our redemption shall once appeare, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the trumpets shal blow, and the deade
shall rise, those that are found aliue shall
be changed,<note place="margin">1. Thes. 4. 16.</note> and wee all which beleeue,
shall meete the Lorde in the ayre, and so
reigne with him in glorie for euer, which
time shoulde long since haue come vpon
the worlde,<note place="margin">2. Pet 3. 9.</note> sauing that the Lord is paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to vswarde, and will not that anie
of vs should perishe, and not of vs onely,
which now liue, but of those also, which
shalbe raised vp in posteritie after vs,
whom he hath likewise appointed vnto
saluation,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 40.</note> and will in his good time call
by the ministerie of his Gospell, least we
without them shoulde be consecrated in
that glorie, wherevnto he hath redeemed
vs. The Lord therefore in mercie hasten
the fulfiling of the number of his elect,
that the daies of sinne may cease, and that
our sauiour Christ, as he appeared in the
fulnes of time with a sacrifice for sinne,
so may now againe,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 28.</note> when al things shall
be accomplished, appeare without sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
vnto the saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of al those, that wait
for his returne to iudge the quick and the
deade.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 24. 18.</note> That rendring vp the kingdome
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13310:24"/>
vnto his father God may be all in al. And
that we in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time walking as Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes
&amp; stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers in this world holding
foorth the light of the holy woord of God
and bearing our selues as heauenly Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 20.</note>
may haue a safe and ioyfull passage
euer lifting vp our heades with the rest
