            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Such wives, who not only lye in the bosoms, but lodge in the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of loving husbands, who are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred with places of Command, joyning IMPORTUNITIE to their OPPORTUNITIE, may be marvellously <hi>instrumental</hi> to the happinesse of our Nation.</p>
               <p>We read of Ahab [1 King. 21.25.] that <hi>none was like him, who sold himself to work wickednesse in the sight of the Lord whom Iezabel his wife stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up.</hi> By the same proportion that person will prove peerlesse in piety, who hath a godly consort in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, seasonably to incite him, who

               <p>WE read Luk. 13.11. of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had a <hi>Spirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up her self.</hi> This woman may passe for the lively Emblem of the <hi>English</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the year of our Lord 1642. (when our wars first began) unto this present 1660. are eighteen years in my Arithmetick; all which time our land hath been bowed together, past possibility of standing upright.</p>
               <p>Some will say that the weight of heavy <hi>Taxes</hi> have caused this crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse. But alas! this is the <hi>least</hi> and <hi>lightest</hi> of all things, I reflect at in this allusion. It is chiefly the <hi>weight of our sins</hi> [Heb. 12.1.] which doth so easily <hi>beset us.</hi> Our mutual malice
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57124:3"/>
and animosities which have caused this incurvation.</p>
               <p>A pittifull posture wherein the <hi>face</hi> is made to touch the <hi>feet,</hi> and the <hi>back</hi> is set above the <hi>head.</hi> God in due time <hi>set us right,</hi> and <hi>keep us right,</hi> that the Head may be in its proper place.

               <p>When thus our Land in <hi>Gods lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> shall be restored to its former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude, and set upright again, then I hope she may leave off her STEEL-BODIES which have galled her with wearing them so long, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to her peaceable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <head>III. Hand on Mouth.</head>
               <p>IT is said Gen. the 6.11. <hi>how before the floud, the earth was filled with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence.</hi> Some will say (with <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>) <hi>how can these things be,</hi> violence being Relative, and requiring a Counter-part. Though such Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants were Hammers, others must be Patient-Anvils, for them to smite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Such persons purely passive in Oppression, were to be pittied, not punished, to be delivered, not drowned in the floud.</p>
               <p>But the answer is easie, seeing we read in the same Chapter vers. 5. <hi>That God saw, that the imaginations of the thoughts of man was only evil conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</hi> God plainly perceived that the <hi>sufferers</hi> of violence would have been <hi>Offerers</hi> of it, if impowred with <hi>Might</hi> equall to their <hi>Malice.</hi> Their <hi>Curstnesse</hi> was a <hi>sharp,</hi> though their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57124:4"/>
                  <hi>Horns</hi> were not so long, and what they lacked in <hi>Deed</hi> and <hi>actions,</hi> they made up in <hi>Desires</hi> and <hi>Endeavours.</hi> So that in sending a generall <hi>Deluge</hi> over all, God was clearly just, and men justly miserable.</p>
               <p>Let such <hi>English</hi> men, who have been of the <hi>depressed party</hi> during our Civill Wars, enter into a scrutiny and serious search of their own soules, whether or no (if armed with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) they would not have laid as great <hi>Load</hi> on others, as themselves under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went. Yea, let them out of a <hi>godly jealousie</hi> suspect more <hi>Cruelty</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, then they can conceive. Then will they find just cause to take the blame and shame on themselves, and give God the glory, that he hath not drowned all in a generall <hi>Deluge</hi> of <hi>Destruction.</hi>

               <head>IV. At last.</head>
               <p>A Ladie of quality formerly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to promote our Civil Warres, and whose <hi>well-intending Zeal</hi> had sent in all her <hi>Plate</hi> to <hi>Guild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> was earnestly discoursing with a <hi>Divine</hi> concerning these Times a little before Dinner; Her face respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Cup-bord in the Room<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was furnished with plenty of pure <hi>Venice</hi> Glasses: <hi>Now</hi> (said she) <hi>I plainly perceive, that I and many of my Iudgement have been abused with the specious Pretences of Liberty and Religion, 'till in the undiscreet pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof we are almost fallen into Slavery and Atheisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To whom the other betwixt jest and earnest replyed; <hi>Madam, it is no wonder, that now your eyes are ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: for so long as this cup-bord was full of thick and massie Plate, you could
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57124:5"/>
perceive nothing through them; but now so many clear and transparent Glasses are substituted in their room, all things are become obvious to your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The possessing of superfluous Wealth, sometimes doth hinder our clear apprehensions of matters; like a <hi>Pearl</hi> in the eye of the Soul, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicing the sight thereof; whilest po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty may prove a good <hi>Collyrium,</hi> or <hi>Eye salve</hi> unto us, to make a true dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of those things we know not before.</p>

               <p>I Beheld <hi>Honour</hi> as of a <hi>mounting</hi> and Aspiring Nature; and therefore I expected (rationally enough as I conceive) to have found it ascending to the Clouds.</p>
               <p>I looked upon Wealth as what was <hi>Massie, Ponderous,</hi> and by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence

probable to settle and be firmly fixed on the Earth.</p>
               <p>But oh! how much is my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation frustrated and defeated? for <hi>David</hi> [Psalm 7.5.] maketh mention of <hi>honour lying in the dust</hi>: and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> his son [Prov. 23.5.] informeth me, how <hi>riches certainly make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wings, and flee away as an eagle toward heaven:</hi> what I looked for <hi>below,</hi> is tow'red <hi>aloft,</hi> and what I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected <hi>above</hi> is fallen <hi>below.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our age hath afforded plentifull Experiments of both: <hi>Honour</hi> was <hi>near</hi> the <hi>dust,</hi> when a <hi>new Nobility</hi> of a <hi>later stamp</hi> were in a fair likelyhood to have out shined those of a <hi>purer standard.</hi> The wealth of the Land doth begin (to use the <hi>Faulconer</hi>'s <hi>phrase</hi>) to <hi>flie to lessen.</hi> And if these Taxes continue, will soon <hi>flie out of sight.</hi> So uncertain and unsafe it is for men to bottom their happinesse on any earthly perfection.</p>

               <p>I Saw a traveller in a terrible tempest take his seasonable shelter under a fair and thick Tree: it afforded him protection for a good time, and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him from the rain.</p>
               <p>But, after that it held up, and was fair round about, he unhappily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued under the Tree so long 'till the droppings thereof made him soundly wet, and he found more to condemn his weaknesse, then pity his wetting.</p>
               <p>A Parliament is known to be the best Refuge and Sanctuary to shelter Us from the tempest of violence and oppression. It is sometimes the <hi>Sole</hi> and alwayes the <hi>Surest</hi> Remedy in that kind. But alas! The late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lasted so <hi>Long,</hi> that it began to be the grievance of the Nation, after that the most and best <hi>Members</hi> thereof were violently excluded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57124:6"/>The remedy turned the Malady of the Land, and we were in fear to be drowned by the droppings of that Tree, if God of his gracious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse had not put an unexpected pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to their Power.</p>

               <p>I Observe in Scripture, that <hi>Power</hi> to do some deeds is a sufficient <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> to do them.

               <p>
                  <hi>Eliah</hi>'s <hi>Power</hi> to make <hi>fire</hi> to come at his call on the <hi>two Captains</hi> was <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> enough to do it, because such deeds were above the <hi>strength, sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> &amp; <hi>standard</hi> of human proportion.</p>
               <p>However hence it doth not follow that it is lawfull for a private man with <hi>Axes</hi> and <hi>Hammers</hi> to beat down a Christian Church, because <hi>Sampson</hi> pluckt down <hi>Dagon</hi>'s <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>; nor doth it follow that men may burn their brethren with <hi>fagot</hi> and <hi>fire,</hi> because <hi>Eliah</hi> called for <hi>fire</hi> from <hi>heaven</hi>; These being acts not <hi>miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> but <hi>mischievous</hi>; &amp; no <hi>might</hi> from <hi>heaven,</hi> but meer <hi>malice</hi> from <hi>Hell,</hi>

               <p>A Gentleman had <hi>two Tenants,</hi> whereof one being a QUAKER, repaired to his <hi>Land-lord</hi> on the <hi>Quarter-day; Here</hi> THOU (said he) <hi>tell out and take</hi> THY <hi>Rent,</hi> without stirring his <hi>cap,</hi> or shewing the least sign of respect.</p>
