            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſet forms of Prayer, by ſome men, in ſome caſes may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

of the lawfulneſſe of ſuch prayers, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether a ſet form
of Prayers, this in particular to which the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
hath been, and is laudibly as piouſly accuſtomed, may
<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, expediently be uſed, and enjoyned by all to be
uſed, in a nationall Church, as ours is.</p>
            <p>To the clearing of which point, there are two things of
neceſſity to be done:
<list>
                  <item>1. The conveniencies and inconveniencies of ſuch prayers
in the generall, muſt be weighed.</item>
                  <item>2. The blemiſhes with which this of ours in particular is
charged muſt be examined</item>
               </list>
According as we find which, for or againſt, our concluſion
muſt be made.</p>
            <p>1. It ſuits to, and agrees beſt with Gods own proceedings
in the government of his Church. In which it hath pleaſed
his divine wiſdome ſo to order the matter, that (ſince all
men are not alike capable of knowledge, nor have the ſame
abilities,) his providence ſhould as it were conform it ſelf to
this unequall condition of men: whence it is, he hath made
choice of ſome to teach others, and pray for others; choſe
ſome to be Apoſtles, ſome Miniſters, Paſtors, Teachers;
whereas had he not had reſpect to this, and purpoſed to go
along with this weakneſſe of mans nature, he could as well
have infuſed abilities (I mean ſupernaturall) into the breſt
and brain of the moſt ignorant deſpicable member of the
Church, ſufficient without other teachings or helps, to have
raiſed him to converſe with God here, and poſſeſſe God
hereafter, as ever he did into the ableſt of the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>And now having thus ordered the matter; (for thus it is,
was, and ever will be, let men dream never ſo long, torture
and rack Scripture, to make it roare out an imaginary lying
perfection) God looks that thoſe ſome which he hath choſe,
endued, ſet apart to teaching and praying, and all other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63678:17"/>
of miniſteriall function, as they are publike men, ſo
ſhould have a publike care of that Church wherein they
are: So drive, as the Church may go like a flock together,
a due reſpect had to the Lambs and Ewes big with young, to
the weary, faint, and lame:
<q>—Hanc aegram vix Tytere duco:</q>
which alwayes are the moſt conſiderable number.</p>
            <p>Yea, come we to the Shepheards themſelves: How many
laborious, painfull, conſcionable men are there, that if theſe
helpes may not be allowed them, muſt either tempt God,

            </p>
            <p>2. Such Liturgies and ſet forms are moſt expedient, if we
look to the nature of Prayers (publike Prayers.)</p>
            <p>Prayer in it ſelf conſidered, Is the proper act of the ſoul,
of the will and underſtanding, and may be completely and
perfectly offered up to God, without thoſe ſubſidiary helps
of invention, diſpoſition, memory, language; theſe, when
we ſpeak of private Prayer, are but the vain pomp of it: when
of publike, the neceſſary adjuncts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will pray with the Spirit, and I will pray with underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15. This often miſ-applyed Text is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of publike Prayer, as you may ſee by comparing it
with the ſecond verſe, <hi>He that speaketh or prayeth in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
tongue, ſpeaketh or prayeth not unto men, but unto God.</hi>
By <hi>Spirit</hi> is meant (not as our vain humouriſts would have
it) an extemporall faculty of wording it, but that gift of the
Spirit which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> mentions verſ. 5, 6, &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
gift of tongues, or faculty of ſpeaking divers lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages:
by underſtanding is meant the underſtanding of the
people; for he that prayeth in an unknown tongue, prayeth
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63678:17"/>
not unto men, that is, not to their underſtanding. That
which I gather from hence is this; That thoſe publike Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are moſt expedient to be uſed, which are moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
to the capacity of the people. Herein I known you
will agree with me. I go on. But a ſet form is moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate,
<hi>Ergo.</hi> This propoſition is eaſily proved: I make it
good thus.</p>
            <p>1. The underſtanding is prae-acquainted with, and the
ſubject otherwiſe difficult is thus made obvious and eaſie.
2. The matter is the ſame, not at the will, or paſſion, or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
or negligence of him that prayeth to be varied: by
reaſon of which, ſometime the people cannot, ſometime dare
not go along with their Miniſter. 3. Though the language
be not in it ſelf unknown, yet the harſhneſſe of it in ſome, the
length and ediouſneſſe of ſtile in others, the affected heighth
of forced Allegories and Tropes, not to ſay the nonſenſe
and ridiculouſly abſurd variations of many pretenders to
the faculty, render<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it altogether as unintelligible, as it were
Latine or Greek. If were to make good this aſſertion by a
particular in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ance, I would go no farther than your prayer
you have given us, <hi>pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 6, 37, 38. which infinite of honeſt
and ſimple Chriſtians would no more know how to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
than they would doe a Scene out of <hi>Iohnſons Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what command in Scripture is there for it? Where
is <hi>conceived prayer</hi> mentioned! what ſuch virtue is there in
the extemporall wording of a Prayer, that for the giving it
ſuch undoubted liberty we muſt run all theſe hazzards? The
ſoul may be as much inflamed that prayes in a ſet form, as
that which doth not: and that may be as cold that prayes
<hi>extempore.</hi> Will you ſay, that every one that hath the gift,
hath alſo affections anſwerable? you dare not. That then
may be belyed, and we ſhall admire the ſpirit where it is
not: what is this, but to warm our ſelves at a painted fire?
For indeed it is not the volubility or roundneſſe of tongue,
that is the work of Gods Spirit primarily in him that hath
this gift of Prayer, but the enkindling of the affections: I
ſay primarily; for where the Spirit of Grace, which is as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63678:18"/>
fire in the heart, findes ſuch abilities, ſuch naturall abilities,
either actuall or potentiall, it doth catch hold of them, and
make fuell as it were of them, whereby the ſoul burns the
more ardently: But where it finds them not, God never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth
them, (this is meer Anabaptiſme) otherwiſe no ſuch
abilities,<note place="margin">See Perkins ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Conſc. of ſet forms of Prayer.</note> no grace, no extemporall expreſſions, no Prayer.
And this being thus, doth it make a Prayer ever the more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God, that it is extemporall? Doth it make a
Prayer unacceptable, that it is not ſo? In truth, no: But this
is it, there is more of the man in the extemporall Prayer, and
that makes us doat ſo much upon it; as the fond mother
commonly loves that child beſt, whoſe face is moſt like her,
though perhaps of worſt conditions. You cannot but know,
that there are of the holieſt men, and moſt able Miniſters
about London, and elſewhere, that both uſe our Liturgy,
and accuſtome themſelves to a ſet form of their own; wiſely
conſidering as I ſaid before, that they are publike men, and
are bound to do not what they could more to their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
but what they muſt, to the peoples. Yea, thoſe that
do uſe extemporall expreſſions, I would ask them, how far
they are from a ſet form: Is not yeſterdayes, to dayes, to
morrows, and every dayes Prayer alike, in the frame, oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
or diſpoſition of the matter? Is not the matter the
ſame? do they not preface, petition, conclude always alike?
Not in the ſame words, you will ſay. Well, but S. <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo
in all his Epiſtles in the very ſame words; and it is more than
probable did ſo in all his Prayers. If there be new emergent
occaſions, do not thoſe men inſert into their own? doth not
the Church inſert into the Common-prayer book ſuch peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as are needfull for thoſe occaſions? Conſider then in
what things their Prayers come near yours, and yours come
near theirs, and where's the difference? why is the world
diſtracted about nothing? either you are exorbitant, or
both may agree.</p>
            <p>3. Moſt expedient to attain the end ſuch worſhip drives
at; Order, Unity, Piety, and the beſt advancement of Gods
glory: Whereas an unbounded liberty in extemporall and
fanaticall Prayers, brings forth the quite contrary; diſorder,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63678:18"/>
diſ-union of affections between man and man, impiety, athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm,
and anarchy. <hi>Ex ungue leonem.</hi> What leud demeanours,
what inſolent and irreligious behaviours, both towards the
Book of Common-prayers, and the men that uſe them, hath
this lawleſs time ſhewn? now, while the laws are ſtill in force
that authorize them. The King and Parliament devoutly
uſe them, religious people morning and evening frequent
them; now ſome to ſpurn and tear them, others ſpit at them,
you to call them ſuperſtitious, evill, a Crambe, a Kickſhoe,
an Hotch-potch, a Drench, &amp;c. If this be not the higheſt
degree of profanation, nothing is. Surely, if we do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
for this, our poſterity will; and beſides that, bluſh
when ever they ſhall be upbraided by ſuch prodigiouſly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſticall
Anceſtors. But to proceed: What order can ever
be expected? what uniformity looked for? what conſent
and harmony betwixt Church and Church, when every one
ſhall differ in that which ſhould make them truly one? a
Communion of Saints, even their community of Prayers?
How, while ſome are ſtarved, ſhall others be pampered? and
then what likeneſſe? Tell me not, that they that will ſhall
uſe the Churches ſet forms; for either they will be wholly
neglected, where others cannot be had, being ſo diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced,
if left arbitrary; diſcountenanced, I ſay, by publike
authority, &amp; depraved, condemned, damned, by private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
or elſe, whiles both are in uſe, it will nouriſh a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
enmity betwixt the uſers of each. It is a requiſite in
the Church of Chriſt, that the particular Congregations
which are the members of that myſticall body, be of one
heart and one minde, eſpecially in their Prayers to, and
Praiſes of God; more eſpecially in publike meetings, at pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
deliverances, in publike dangers: how ſhall we be ſo,
when we ſhall not know what one anothers hearts and
mindes are? No, but the deſigne of your dear friend, the
Authour of <hi>The Proteſtation proteſted,</hi> and ſome ſince him,
is, to have the Church at length ſifted and winnowed, and
the grain laid apart by it ſelf, that is your faction; and for
the chaffe, all elſe, let them do or be what they will, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
not. If the Kings State will maintain the faith of Chriſt,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63678:19"/>
well and good, they ſhall have your fair leave: if not, they
ſhall have your leave too; ſo you may enjoy your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
you are indifferent. This is the <hi>Common good</hi> that is
cryed up, though indeed the <hi>Publike wo:</hi> and thus you tread
a fair way to it: you ſhall have the hold of the hearts of the
people, the ſureſt hold that may be, of their conſciences, of
all their religiouſeſt actions, their Prayers, Supplications &amp;c.
and the State ſhall have none of you: not command you to
pray for the King, that you ſay is time ſpent in flattery;
not for Biſhops, they are Antichriſtian; not for his ſubjects,
that they may live godly and peaceable lives u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if Chriſt had been pleaſed to have converted to his faith but
one King and his whole State, and for to have ordered a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
Church, and have given over to us that order as a
pattern, ſurely it ſhould not have been any ſuch independent
anarchicall Government as your platform is, nay will be if
we can tell when; for as yet the Whelp is not licked into any
faſhion. You ſay that ſet forms of Prayers are quenching
the Spirit; whether it be ſo or no, I am ſure your Extempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
will ſet ſuch a fire on your Spirits, that they will need
quenching, or the whole Kingdome will burn with them.

               <hi>Anim</hi> The heathen Philoſophers thought, virtue was for its own

ſo inamoured of her, as to teach and ſtudy her, with greateſt neglect
and contempt of worldly profit and advancement: and is Chriſtian
Piety ſo homely and unpleaſant, and Chriſtian men ſo cloyed with
her, as that none will ſtudy and teach her but for lucre and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!

I would fain have it ſo. For were there no guile in them, as I do
continually nouriſh ſuch thoughts, ſo would I never deſire to
have them better cloathed: if at any time a floud of eloquence
becomes us, it is when we expreſſe ſuch a love, or ſuch an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation!
But it is one thing that you ſay, and another thing that
you prove: the means is often times reſted and taken up in ſtead
of the end; therefore the means is not the means; or therfore the
means cannot be looked at as the means: illogicall and abſurd!
A Philoſopher loves virtue; and a Chriſtian loves him that is the
fountain of that virtue; What then? The Philoſopher, you ſay, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
virtue for it ſelf; So doth a Chriſtian love God much more.
But he did it with neglect of others things, wealth, honours, &amp;c.
He came then ſo much ſhort of his own Philoſophicall perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
They that ſtood a begging in the ſtreets, might (if it had
pleaſed them) have been as <hi>liberall</hi> as their beſt Maſters; And
that Philoſopher that flung his gold into the ſea, might have been
perhaps leſſe an Infidell, if he had provided for himſelf and his
family with it; I am ſure might have been more magnificent.

he requires either nothing, if he could ſo ſubſist; or a very common
and reaſonable ſupply of humane neceſſaries. We cannot do better
therefore than to leave this care of ours to God; he can eaſily ſend
Labourers into his harveſt.—He can ſtir up rich fathers to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
exquiſite education upon their children and ſo dedicate them to
the ſervice of the Gospel, he can make the ſons of Nobles his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi>
&amp;c pag. 56. <hi>Animad.</hi> No man doubts of what God
can do; but we may well doubt he will not do what we would
have him, while we are thus froward and unthankfull; while we
are under perſecution, poor, wretched, and deſpicable, fed but
from hand to mouth, (as we ſay) whiles God leads his Church
through a deſart or wilderneſſe: If we expect our drink to drop
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63678:23"/>
out of a flint, or from the ſhivers of a barren and dry rock; if we
ſpread our table to a miracle, or every morning and evening look
out for a Raven to feed us, it becomes our condition, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God anſwers our expectation: but if when he hath brought
his Church into a land that flows with milk and honey; when
he hath made <hi>Kings our nurſing Fathers, and Queens our nurſing
Mothers,</hi> we will then over-look all that bounty, and ſay God
can do thus and thus, <hi>can raiſe out of theſe ſtone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and bring up thoſe children to his own work, at his own
miraculous expences; this is but to tempt his providence. God
can do this and more, but his wayes are his own. He can rain
Manna into our mouths, as well as dew upon the earth. Shall
we be angry, becauſe we have our Corn at the ſecond hand? he
could have ſent us into the world with our cloaths on; is it not
as well that he ſets the worm to the wheel to ſpin it for us? doth
he not ſhew a work of providence in preparing both for us, as
well as in giving them to us? ſo no doubt he could have imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
from himſelf ſupplyed the neceſſities of his Miniſters; is
it not as well that he doth it by others? doth he not make a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
out of what we have, in their hands through which it paſſeth?
is it not liberality, is it not munificence in them that give it? why
ſhould we envie good men their piety? or are theſe virtues out of
date, were they only ceremoniall? hath God impropriated all
the riches of the earth for the uſe of the Lay-men only? are not
Glergy-men members of the body of Chriſt, why ſhould not
