            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And was not all this performed by the

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> had wont to call the

thetime, to ſhew you how great a miſſe a
State may haue of Worthy men, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deare
to you men of action.</p>
            <p>For we haue put off our Armour, and our

Monuments of old, then Inſtrumentes of

haue been better ſpared: Smooth and euen

vs. Let not our eyes, ô Lord, nor the eyes
of our vnborne Children and Nephewes,

ioyne in prayer alwayes for the peace of our

            <p>Yet by the faire leaue of a gentle Peace,
let vs conſider that the Sonnes of <hi>Zeruiah</hi>

            <p>But this is my third, and laſt Obſeruation:
For <hi>Dauid</hi> deſireth that notice be taken of

ſuch ſadd accidents: but men keepe ſuch
things as much as they may, from the heart,
<pb facs="tcp:21696:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
loath to entertaine ſo vnwelcome a gueſt
as Griefe is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dauid</hi> doth not put them in minde of it
as of ſome ſadd betiding to <hi>Abner:</hi> for the
aduantage of the death of the Righteous is
manifold.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Reſt from labours:</hi> For it is moſt true
which <hi>S. Bern.</hi> ſayth: <hi>Qui in labore hominum
non ſunt, in labore profecto Doemonum erunt:</hi>
They that labour not heere amongſt men,

            <p n="2">2 <hi>They are taken avvay</hi> from the euill to

            <p>But <hi>Dauids</hi> end in this bemoaning of <hi>Abner</hi>
is, to teach them to depende vpon God, not

            <p>It is our great fault that when God giueth
any ſuch blow to our State, the ſmart of it

perſonage, of an caſie and affable nature
where his diſcretion found it fitt to be ſo:
of a daring and hardie ſpirit. of a ſterne and

Great in the fauoure of the late Maieſtie
of this Land, and ſucceeding in his loue,
who ſucceeded in her greatnes: great in his
employment and office of truſt and charge:
and (for which he forgate not his duetie to
God in all humble thankes giuing amongſt
his dying meditations) very fortunate and
ſuccesfull: great in the loue of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
man that went vnder his charge; for
the eye that ſaw him, bleſſed him; and euery
tongue of theirs, beare witneſſe of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous

               <p>Great in his eſtate and means of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
for <hi>like a Tree planted by the Riuers

him a plentifull encreaſe: But that which
maketh all this greatneſſe a great deale
greater, hee had an vnderſtanding to know
God, and an affection to loue him.</p>
               <p>I muſt not flatter the remembrance of
fleſh and blood ſo farre, as to exempt him
from offending (with other men) I know
that humanitie and infirmitie are indiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall:
But I am his witneſſe, that he looked
vpon his life paſt, with a cenſorious eye: hee
charged himſelfe with his defaultinges
<pb facs="tcp:21696:18"/>
without excuſe or mittigation of his ſinnes,
euen with deteſtation of his vnthriftines of
good howers, and ſorrow for the loſſe of ſo
pretious minutes, that ſhould hane been
better ſpent, and with moſt ſerious depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods wrath.</p>
               <p>It pleaſed him in my attendaunce vpon
his honourable Father in Law into <hi>Spayne,</hi>
wherein this worthy Knight had a great
place of Commaund and Charge: it pleaſed
him in this expedition, to take knowledge
of mee, and often to vouchſafe me his
conference: and being deſirous to ſing the
ſonge of the Lord in a ſtrange Land, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
at my hands the Sacrament of the
body and blood of Chriſt, accompanied
with many worthy Knights, &amp; Gentlemen
of qualitie, in one of the Harboroughs of
that Land; where there was peace for our
perſons, but not for our religion: Yea, many
wayes he teſtified to mee, his loue of God,
and of our Religion: Hee looked iudicially
into the difference betweene vs and the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> touched with commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the darknes wherein they lyued,
and wiſhing encreaſe of zeale amongſt vs,
<pb facs="tcp:21696:18"/>
and knowledge with them.</p>
               <p>After his returne, it pleaſed Almighty God
by his laſt Sicknes, to put him in minde that
hee muſt <hi>ſet his Houſe in order: For he muſt
die.</hi> This he maturely regarded; and after
the ſetling of his Eſtate, he reſerued the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
of his time, as a vacation from all
temporall thoughts, and conſecrated it to
his preparation for his remooue of the
body, that he might dwell with the Lord.</p>
               <p>It pleaſed him then, to remember his
acquaintaunce, with mee; and when hee
had diſpatched a Meſſenger with his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to mee, to entreat my reſort to him, I
preuented expectation: for the vnwelcome
newes of his dangerous Sickneſſe, was to
mee meſſenger enough to call vpon mee
to doe ſo Honourable a Friende my laſt
ſeruice.</p>
               <p>Hee receiued my free and voluntarie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation,
with more then thankes: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to be priuate with mee, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he beſpake mee.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he tolde me of his preſent weaknes,
and appeared to mee ſenſible of his danger
of death, and therefore proteſted an earneſt
<pb facs="tcp:21696:19"/>
deſire to ſpend that ſhort time of life limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
then to him, in a religious preparation
for that end.</p>
               <p>Hee began at the acouſing of his former
leawd life (ſo he was pleaſed to call it, with
a ſorrowfull deteſtation of it) and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning
to mee of his preſent infirmitie,
which had ſo weakened his memorie &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
that he could not lay him ſelfe
ſo open before God as he deſired, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
in fitte wordes his ſuite to God for
pardon of his ſinnes, and the aſſiſtance of his
holy Grace to the laſt gaſpe, as he wiſhed:
Hee earneſtly deſired mee to conceiue a
forme of confeſsion of his ſinnes to God,
and a Prayer for thoſe mercies which I
might leaue with him when I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
from him.</p>
               <p>This I ſoone ſatisfied him in, for I had
more vſe herein of my memorie of that
which he had deliuered to mee, then of my
inuention for that which I was to delyuer
to him: His ſorrowes had the true face of
woe; and his feeling of his owne griefe for
finne, was ſo ſenſible, his zeale ſo feruent,
his humiliation made him ſo deiected, that
<pb facs="tcp:21696:19"/>
I ſaw in him a true mirrour and preſident
of repenting in good earneſt.</p>
               <p>O let mee heare the tongue ſpeake which
is prompted by a ſoule truely humbled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God. Hee vſed this forme of Prayer,
with an affection ſanctified, and a Spirit
wayned from this world: And this done,
he deſired mee now to ſupply the weakenes
of his memorie, by calling into his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
thoſe thinges which are moſt fitte
to be the laſt thoughts of a dying man.</p>
               <p>I ſpared not my beſt endeuour herein,
and entertained him with all the comfortes
which I could.</p>
               <p>Hee heard mee attentiuely, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly,
conſentfully, and beleeuingly: And
confeſſed this doctrine of Peace, which
paſſeth all vnderſtanding, to be the beſt Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke;
and that onely which now he deſired.</p>
               <p>Thus commending him to my earneſt
Prayers to God, hee diſmiſſed mee, pro teſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he had much cheared and refreſhed
his ouercharged ſpirit with theſe holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes;
hee deſired mee to repaire to him
the morning following betimes: this I did
gladly, and full of hope that the Lord would
<pb facs="tcp:21696:20"/>
haue mercy on vs, that he might liue.</p>
               <p>When I came, hee gaue mee a louing and
chearefull welcome, and then deſired mee
not to depart from him, till I had ſeene the
laſt of him. Hee told mee of the ſorrowes
which he had ſuſtained the night paſt, and
that he ſaw no poſsibilitie of life beyonde
the morning following, he found ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
in himſelfe: then I vnderſtood how in
the night paſt, he had called vpon God, and
what good watch he kept, that if at midnight,
or at the dawning, God had ſent for him
hence, hee might not be vnprouided.</p>
               <p>Hee then in the hearing of vs all preſent,
made his confeſsion of ſinnes, and prayers
to God ſo earneſtly and effectually, that
when he requeſted vs all to pray to God for
him, hee taught vs to be importunate, and
that it paſt not good manners to take no
nay of our God. I neuer ſowed my comfort
in a better ground; for I began to reape, ere
I had done ſowing. Hee heard our prayers
for him, with grea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> content &amp; comfort.</p>
               <p>This whole day was ſpent in prayers, and
reading of thoſe things to him which might
beſt endeare to him the ioyes of Heauen:
<pb facs="tcp:21696:20"/>
and when he felt his decay more ſenſible, he
deſired our prayers to God for him againe,
as loth to looſe the aduantage of any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
of that ſhort time of his life: and after
vs, hee ſayd the Lords Prayer, to our great
reioycing in his zeale, who grieued ſo much
for his weakeneſſe; and hee teſtified to vs
witneſſes, the Religion and Fayth wherein
hee died.</p>
               <p>I deſired him to be plaine and true to me
in one demaunde: I ſhewed him how thoſe
that are in miſerie (as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaketh) ſeeke
after death, and reioyce when they can finde
the Graue; but their miſerie and wearines
of ſuffering, bringeth foorth in them theſe
defires: But for him who had plentie of all

                  </gap>tude, and the
common language of all men to applaude
his noble deſertes of the ſtate in which hee
liued: I enquired therefore if hee who bad
ſo many prouocations to deſire to liue, could
be content to forſake this life, and all theſe
<pb facs="tcp:21696:21"/>
thinges? Hee ſmiled cheerefully, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
that hee dyed as willingly, as that
poore man mentioned in <hi>Iob,</hi> that had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but miſerie to forſake; for Heauen
was his hope, and GOD his exceeding great
reward.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, hee began to decay more
and more, and ſlumbring out a little time,
after ſome pange and ſtrong Conuulſions,
hee fell into this laſt ſleepe, leauing teares
in euery beholders eye, and deuiding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
vs his friendes and followers, a well
witneſt ſorrow: and leauing this body of
clay to theſe our laſt obſequies.</p>
               <p>Thus leauing him with God; and to
God commending our ſelues, I conclude.
