            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

at first nothing but a simple and continued Satyre, sung by one

a third, <hi>Phormus,</hi> and <hi>Chionides</hi> devised to have foure actors, with
a <hi>Prologue</hi> and <hi>Chorus;</hi> to which <hi>Cratinus</hi> (long after) added a fift
and sixt; <hi>Eupolis</hi> more, <hi>Aristophanes</hi> more than they: every
man in the dignitie of his spirit and judgement, supplied some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
and (though that in him this kind of Poeme appeared
absolute, and fully perfected) yet how is the face of it chang'd
since, in <hi>Menander, Philemon, Cecilius, Plautus,</hi> and the rest; who
have vtterly excluded the <hi>Chorus,</hi> altered the propertie of the
persons, their names, and natures, and augmented it with all
libertie, according to the elegancie and disposition of those
times wherein they wrote? I see not then but we should enjoy

the same <hi>Licentia</hi> or free power, to illustrate and heighten our
invention as they did; and not be tied to those strict and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular

(mixt with some few braues) which I restor'd, and in fine wee
met. Now indeed Sir (I must tell you) he did offer at first very
desperatly, but without judgement: for looke you sir. I cast

my selfe into this figure: now he, comes violently on, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
advancing his Rapier to strike, I thought to haue took his
arme (for he had left his whole body to my election, and I was
sure he could not recouer his guard) Sir, I mist my purpose in
his arme, rasht his doublet sleeue, ran him close by the left
cheeke, and through his haire: He again lights me here, I had
a gold Cable hatband then new come vp, (which I wore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a murrey French Hat I had) cuts my Hatband (and yet it
was Massie, gold-Smithes worke) cuts my brimmes, which by
good fortune (being thicke embrodered with gold twist, and
Spangles) disapointed the force of the blow: Neuerthelesse it
graz'd on my shoulder, takes mee away sixe purles of an

it was not so great a part of the Heauen awry, as they would

Reasons.</p>
            <p>1 There hath been <hi>President</hi> of the like Presentation in diuers
Playes: and is yeerely in our Cittie <hi>Pageants</hi> or shewes of
<hi>Triumph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 It is to be conceiu'd, that <hi>Macilente</hi> being so strongly possest
with <hi>Enuie,</hi> (as the <hi>Poet</hi> heere makes him) it must bee no
sleight or common <hi>Object,</hi> that should effect so suddaine and
straunge a cure vpon him, as the putting him cleane <hi>Out of
his Humor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 If his <hi>Imagination</hi> had discours't the whole world ouer for
an <hi>Object,</hi> it could not haue met with a more Proper, Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or worthie <hi>Figure,</hi> than that of her Maiesties: which
his <hi>Election</hi> (though boldly, yet respectively) vs'd to a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi>
and <hi>Mysterious</hi> end.</p>
            <p>4 His greedinesse to catch at any <hi>Occasion,</hi> that might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
his affection to his <hi>Soueraigne,</hi> may worthily plead
for him.</p>
            <p>5 There was nothing (in his examin'd <hi>Opinion</hi>) that could
more neare or truly exemplifie the power and strength of her
Inualuable <hi>Vertues,</hi> than the working of so perfect a <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
on so oppos'd a <hi>Spirit,</hi> who not only persisted in his <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi>
but was now come to the <hi>Court</hi> with a purpos'd reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
(his Soule as it were new drest in <hi>Enuie</hi>) to maligne at
